0,Leofwine_draca,"Plenty of potential, but a letdown come the end",5,7 January 2013,"SPLICE is the latest variant on the Frankenstein genre, with a couple of genetic scientists managing to create an alien-human hybrid in their laboratory before it all goes inevitably wrong. By far the most interesting thing about the production is the presence of director Vincenzo Natali, who has been away from movie screens for far too long since his astonishing debut, CUBE.Sadly, SPLICE nowhere equals the quality of that movie, and actually turns out to be a bit lacklustre come the ending. It starts off well in the first half, with some great laboratory scenes that incorporate truly outstanding CGI work in the form of the hybrid creation. The film generates plenty of interest at this stage, but begins to fall apart once the action shifts to outside the laboratory.The ensuing scenes are long, repetitive and seem to go nowhere. I appreciate the change in direction of the storyline, but other than one or two moments of interest, nothing much really happens. By the end, it's turned into yet another generic CGI monster fest. The cast is nothing to write home about either. Adrien Brody seems to have the ability to be either really engaging (as in THE JACKET) or as stiff as a plank of wood (PREDATORS). He veers towards the latter here, and his character is pretty dull. Sarah Polley is better as his slightly zealous partner, but this is hardly an actor's movie.Natali does a fine job of directing and his work is one of the main reasons to keep watching. I'm still surprised at how well they handled those newborn creature scenes; an exemplary combination of live action and CGI imagining that sets a new standard for the calibre of FX. It's a shame there isn't a more original film to hang those effects on.",Splice
1,SnoopyStyle,Disturbing creepiness unlike most other horror movies,7,26 February 2014,"Clive Nicoli (Adrien Brody) and Elsa Kast (Sarah Polley) are a couple working in cutting edge genetics experiments. They've created a new lifeform by splicing different species. They're excited to move onto human genes, but their lab is being shut down. Despite that, they go ahead with their experiment and produce human hybrid Dren.It starts off as a creepy sci-fi creature feature. However just when it seems to settle on a standard horror track, it takes a left turn and gets infinitely more disturbing. It's not scary like a traditional horror movie. So much of the horror show is happening on the human side. Sarah Polley is compelling as the driven Elsa, and what Clive does is just crazy.",Splice
2,Prismark10,The splice of life,3,13 October 2017,"Inspired by James Whale's Frankenstein film and David Cronenberg's body horror films. Splice starts off promisingly and then goes off the rails.Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley) are genetic scientists who created an artificial life spliced with various DNA. Two blob like creatures, one male, the other female are produced which are intended to produce artificial proteins. The scientists then go a step further in creating Dren (Delphine Chaneac) that has an accelerated life cycle but they seemingly have not thought through the ethical issues surrounding their experiment.Clive is reluctant to care for Dren, Elsa has a closer maternal bond with Dren. As Dren quickly grows older, her physical and emotional needs change. Despite looking human she has parts of other creatures such as a tail and wings.As the film is labelled as a horror film you can kind of figure the creature would go on a rampage at the end, however Clive's intimacy with Dren is too left field and far fetched especially as he scolds Elsa for betraying research principles. It has a pretty unconvincing ending which is unintentionally hilarious.",Splice
3,claudio_carvalho,Playing of God,7,9 April 2011,"Clive Nicoli (Adrien Brody) and Elsa Kast (Sarah Polley) are scientists of the Newstead Pharmaceutics researching the splice of DNA from different animals to form new genetic beings and find medical benefits to mankind. They have just created the hybrid Ginger and Fred and now they intend to join together human DNA to alter the genetic structure of their experiment. When the senior management calls off their experiment, they decide to secretly proceed and they generate a life form with human characteristics. They call it Dren (Delphine Chaneac) and Elsa is very fond of their creation that grows up fast and showing intelligence. When the company shutdown their experiment, they bring Dren to Elsa's abandoned farm and the scientists raise Dren like a daughter. But when it reaches adulthood, the sex drive of Dren is activated and Clive and Elsa learn that they have a serious problem to resolve. ""Splice"" is a dramatic sci-fi horror film with the story of two young unethical scientists that decide to play God. The plot is unoriginal but is attractive and engaging, specially because the trio formed by Sarah Polley, Adrian Brody and Delphine Chanéac. The childhood trauma of Elsa is absolutely out of the context and a diversion to the mainstream. The special effects and make-up are awesome, transforming the gorgeous French actress Delphine Chanéac in a creature with an exotic beauty. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Splice – A Nova Espécie"" (""Splice – The New Specie"")",Splice
4,nogodnomasters,Naked human hybrid,6,25 April 2018,"Not as sexy as ""Species"". In fact I really didn't find the hairless human hybrid, even when naked, sexy at all. A couple splices genes and creates a new species of globs they call Fred and Ginger. The globs are created to produce proteins etc. to enhance animal livestock. The inventive couple discovers they could splice human DNA and create a new species in order to cure human genetic diseases. The corporation forbids them from such an experiment so they go underground to do it. The woman, Elsa (Sarah Polly, slightly mentally unstable) uses her own DNA to create a creature which in the interest of time develops very rapidly. The infant looks like something out of Lynch's ""Eraserhead"". Eventually they have to move the human hybrid to a farm where it is cared for by Elsa and her boyfriend Clive (Adrian Brody).The movie is intellectually interesting, but at the same time has poor characters. I thought I was going to adore this movie from reading the box, but alas, I did not as the stupidity of the characters got in the way.The F-bomb is dropped a few times. Human hybrid nudity and sex including one rape.Worth a view, if you keep your expectations low.",Splice
5,kosmasp,Split,8,26 September 2010,"It didn't manage to splice the audience, that's for sure. I guess you could say, the reactions are divided to this movie. That's a fair thing to say. And as you can see, I'm more in the pro corner, than most of the others (see also rating here). I really liked this one a lot. Despite the fact that it is quite predictable overall and has a few flaws here and there of course.The two main actors elevate this movie for me. Of course the story as it is, could be just another ""Twilight Zone"" episode. But it is this full length feature and while you might have seen something like this before and/or are able to tell where this is going, it still is delivered in a really good fashion. Just because it isn't completely unique and has something of a message (you don't have to agree with that message), doesn't mean it has to be bad. On the other hand, if you give up on the movie, the sooner you shut it off, the better for you",Splice
6,lee_eisenberg,half-human endeavor,5,29 November 2010,"For the most part, Vincenzo Natali's ""Splice"" was about what I expected. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley play genetic engineers who create a hybrid being, only to later find out that their creation is not quite what they hoped for. In my opinion, the coolest scene was the...OK, what's it called? The botched presentation.Alright, so this movie wasn't really intended as anything other than a sci-fi/horror flick. In that respect it succeeds perfectly, although the scientific lingo is probably going to be hard for the average person to understand. If you're looking for plain old entertainment, this should be the right movie for you. Otherwise, it's not the first one that I would recommend.Also starring Delphine Chanéac and Natali regular David Hewlett.",Splice
7,jboothmillard,Splice,5,13 December 2010,"I never heard of this film before I saw the DVD, but it had a distinctive title that gave me ideas of what to expect from it, and the leading actor was appealing too. Basically splicing the DNA of various animals has gone into the public eye with the research and technology of N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research & Development). Genetic engineering scientists Clive Nicoli (Adrien Brody) and Elsa Kast (Dawn of the Dead's Sarah Polley) have created incredible new hybrid animals, and think it is time to try a human DNA splice, but the pharmaceutical company forbids it and tells them to stick to the animals. Going against them, and desperate to prove them wrong, Clive and Elsa secretly carry out this experiment blending human DNA with various animals'. After placing the cell in the egg, and waiting some time for it to grow, the creature has an early birth, and when it reveals itself it may look threatening, but Elsa gives it kindness. Wanting this creature, that they name Dren, to stay alive for the benefit of the research, they let her grow at an accelerated rate. They know that keeping Dren in the lab is very high risk, and they are not ready to prove anything yet, so they take Child Dren (Abigail Chu) to grow up in Elsa's dead mother's barn. While Dren (Délphine Chanéac), now an adult, stays hidden and secluded, Clive and Elsa present the original animal hybrid creatures of N.E.R.D. to the press, with disastrous consequences when one has changed sex. Dren is showing signs of becoming more than something to care for, with her tail stinger and retractable wings she has a temper tantrum that could be dangerous. Clive at one point discovers that it was in fact Elsa's egg used for making the experiment possible, which explains why she manages to seduce him enough to have sex with her. After an argument they go back to the barn to deal with Dren, and they are fooled into thinking she is dead, and the N.E.R.D. boss comes to see the secret research for himself, of course, he meets his fate. Dren springs out, and has now transformed into a male, and after a little chase starts raping Elsa, but Clive manages to impale her, only to have Dren's final fatal sting kill him. In the end Elsa and pharmaceutical company's head are the only two left to know about the secret experiment, but also, Elsa is pregnant with Dren's baby for the ""next stage"", does this mean a sequel? Also starring David Hewlett as William Barlow and Brandon McGibbon as Gavin Nicoli. It reminded me a lot of Species, except that the creature isn't so much evil from the start, and there were elements of a Frankenstein thing with you having some empathy for the monster, an interesting science-fiction horror thriller. Worth watching!",Splice
8,Woodyanders,Intelligent and engrossing sci-fi/horror winner,8,24 October 2012,"Assertive and ambitious Elsa Kast (an excellent performance by the always dependable Sarah Polley) and her more passive partner Clive Nicoli (a fine portrayal by Adrien Brody) specialize in splicing DNA from different animals to create new hybrid lifeforms. Things get out of hand when the pair secretly create a humanoid being called Dren (exceptionally well played with striking expressiveness by Delphine Chaneac), who turns out to be more than either one of them bargained for. Director Vincenzo Natali, who also co-wrote the smart and compelling script with Antoinette Terry Bryant and Doug Taylor, relates the gripping story at a snappy pace, treats the familiar, yet still fascinating premise in an admirably serious, tasteful, and thoughtful manner, and trenchantly explores a pertinent and provocative central theme about the dangerous moral consequences of playing god. Moreover, Natali brings a bold sexual angle to the plot which provides an extra startling and uncomfortable edge, with a freaky hot copulation scene between Clive and Dren proving to be both erotic and alarming in equal measure. However, it's the way that Natali presents Dren as a genuinely pitiable, utterly convincing, and strangely beautiful creature that rates as this film's greatest artistic triumph: Projecting a touchingly fragile, confused, and vulnerable deer in the headlights quality, one can't help but feel sorry for this poor mistreated mutant. Polley and Brody both do ace work in the lead roles, with sturdy support from Brandon McGibbon as Clive's concerned younger brother Gavin, David Hewlett as pragmatic businessman William Barlow, Abigail Chu as the adorable child Dren, and Simona Maicanescu as hard-nosed CEO Joan Chorot. Kudos are also in order for Tetsuo Nagata's sharp cinematography, Cyrille Aufort's classy brooding score, and the remarkably persuasive make-up f/x by KNB. Highly recommended.",Splice
9,rmax304823,Two Actors In Search Of A Movie.,3,18 April 2011,"Only a few observations, because I was able to sit through only the first forty minutes or so of this special effects extravaganza. Remember the scene in ""Alien"" when they find that creature apparently dead on the space ship floor, after it has spent a long time wrapped around John Hurt's head? And then they turn it over on its back and examine its glutinous interior, with all the slimy dead-white organs and liver-colored wet lumps? Disgusting, wasn't it? If you like that scene, you'll love this movie.I can understand why some viewers might be swept up in the morality of the tale because, after all, the implications are all laid out on the examining table for you -- face up. That's why I didn't give this a lower rating.But, frankly, I didn't understand either the technology or the moral conflict. The biological element zips by at warp speed. No need for careful explanation, as in ""Jurassic Park"" or, better yet, ""The Andromeda Strain."" Here, the cuts are instantaneous. Monitors flicker on an off in a flash. Labels come and go with the speed of light. Scientific names last as long as the blink of an eye. (One was Dipsosaurus dorsalis, the desert iguana of the American southwest.) We see cloning take place on a screen. It last about four seconds. I had no idea of what was being cloned. I only understood it was illegal or unethical -- or, at any rate, a bad idea -- because Adrian Brody kept screaming that it was.The, er, the THING that hatches before anyone expects it looks like the horrifying baby in ""Eraserhead"" except that it has the legs of a kangaroo or tarsier and springs from place to place like nobody's business, bouncing off the walls, upsetting cages. It is about the size of a poodle, is shiny, has devious eyes, and two thin feelers. It shows confusion and fear and this attracts Sarah Polley and activates her nurturant reflex. Kitchy kitchy koo! Even when the little bugger is opening its mouth with a threatening hiss. ""Don't kill it,"" she shouts. I'd have stomped the thing like a roach.The irony is that the movie has two performers in the lead who are capable of splendid performances. Sarah Polley has done wonders with earlier roles, especially those requiring repression. And the improbably nosed Adrien Brody can be at will villainous (""Oxygen"") or heroic (""King Kong"") and play it either way with equal vigor.In this instance, they're stuck with a story that could easily have dispensed with human actors entirely and just substituted computer-generated images. Too bad. A shameful waste.",Splice
10,BA_Harrison,"Splice is hilarious. The problem is, it's not supposed to be.",4,9 November 2012,"Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley play Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast, a pair of leading geneticists developing new species from which they can extract proteins that can help cure human diseases. However, for such intelligent people, they sure act dumb, taking a particularly slapdash approach to their work. In trying to create a new life-form, they clumsily combine all manner of DNA with absolutely no bloody idea what the eventual result will be. No surprises then that the experiment is a total mess, quickly evolving from a phallic blob into a fully grown female humanoid with some unique physical attributes and an unpredictable psyche.The main characters' unprofessional methodology isn't the only seriously sloppy thing about Splice: the whole script is a shambles, the opening lab scenes full of incomprehensible scientific hogwash, the latter half of the film seeing Clive and Elsa repeatedly altering personality to suit the clumsy narrative: Clive initially wants to kill his creation, then he tries to help it (smuggling it out of the lab in a cardboard box—great security they have there!), then he screws the genetic abomination on the floor, and then he wants it dead again; Elsa, on the other hand, starts off feeling protective towards the creature (which she affectionately christens Dren), then tries to maim it, is subsequently kind to it, but winds up smashing it over the head with a shovel. And to think I said that Dren had an unpredictable psyche!In accordance with the lousy script (which sees Dren developing amphibious lungs, wings, and a dick!), Brody and Polley's acting is absolutely atrocious, as is Natali's direction. But what makes this film hardest of all to swallow is that Natali began his directorial career in such a promising way with two excellent sci-fi horrors, Cube and Cypher, both of which I highly recommend. Let's just hope that this is just a temporary blip in his career.A generous 4/10 for the impressive special effects and for making me laugh.",Splice
11,paul_haakonsen,"Unique in every way, but...",7,25 July 2010,"Okay, this was a movie that took me by surprise. I hadn't even heard of it, and just came across it by sheer random luck.The story and plot is simply genius, and this is something that should have been put to the screen a long, long time ago. For this movie, sort of think in the terms of mixing ""The Fly"" and ""Species"" together, and throw in some extra spices. It was a super nice storyline, but I would have liked to see more about the morals and ethical dilemmas raised by gene manipulation, splicing and genetic research. The movie just brushed easily over this and paid it little heed. That was a shame.As for the acting and cast, well I would say that the little cast that the movie was centered about really carried their roles and characters well and made the movie believable and interesting to watch. And the creature, Dren, was really portrayed so well, that you started to feel for her and become attached to her.The creature design was phenomenal and very nicely detailed, as always when Nicotero is involved with something. From the very first moment you saw the creature and up until the very end, it was all cool and nice to look at. However, the wings were a tad too much for my liking. But it worked well enough to show the different aspects of mixing genetics from various species.The last 15 minutes of the movie, however, were painful to get through. The story totally collapsed here and it would have served the movie so much better had they decided to do something else. It was a bit too sassy and too far out there. And the ending, well you saw that coming a mile away. I would have rated the movie higher, had it not been for the last 15 minutes and the typical Hollywood ending.But overall, this movie is definitely one you should sit down and watch. It is a unique story and filled with nice effects and details. There is a constant flow to the story, so you are never left bored. And there are a bunch of thrills throughout the movie as well. So watch this movie, you won't be disappointed.",Splice
12,Quinoa1984,is intriguing and alive and exciting in ways horror films today usually aren't... up to a point...,8,3 June 2010,"I admire Vincenzo Natali, I really do. His 1997 film, Cube, about people trapped inside of a maze with intricate doors and traps, showed that you could really make an intellectual horror film and have it work for genre geeks and those more interested in a 'serious' film as opposed to just a 'movie. He showed there he knew what he wanted and could be creative and innovative with stylizing sets, the look of the film, and tension in unpredictable circumstances. Now with Splice, his first feature in years, he gives us a good premise about two doctors who are trying to create some new organisms and stumble upon a possibility of making a human-animal hybrid, they do, and then it becomes like a child for them - or at least the 'mother', and then later the father becomes attached as well.Natali's film is unlike so many other horror movies nowadays because it's about SOMETHING. It's not just teenagers getting hacked up or some crappy remake. It's about, not too oddly enough, parenthood. Clive and Elsa - more-so the latter than the former at first - want to try and make sure this new 'thing', which they call 'Dren' (spell it backwards), adjusts to its environment and is comfortable and, maybe, wanted and loved. The dynamic between the two characters is made up and established wonderfully, for at least a very good portion of the film. These aren't cardboard cut-outs of bio-chemists, but people we want to root for, or are just interested in how their arcs play out. Natali even gets us caring about Dren as she becomes a grown 'woman' in a matter of weeks and more vicious and predatory than ever.It takes Cronenberg influence and of course old 50's sci-fi scientist-creates-this stories and makes it important and scary and even adorable in the way that the Velociraptor looked in Jurassic Park when it came out of its egg. Not to mention some nifty make-up and effects by Gregory Nicotero and his group (Guillermo Del-Toro produced, one can see his influence in the creature's design). And the actors are believable together on screen as a pair and play off of their ""creation"" when it's called upon.So the problem? Well, it's noticeable when watching the picture, but it's the kind of problem that is more evident the more one thinks about it. At a certain point, which is hard to reveal not so much as a spoiler but in telling a long story (let's just say it's foreshadowed, however in this moment innocently, when Clive shows Dren how to dance), Natali flies off the wheels of his train. On top of it just becoming too outrageous, while also still taking itself perfectly seriously, it also in its climax between humans and the human-animal hybrid hits predictable notes; we know who will die, basically, by their importance in the narrative. Most of us (at least those at the midnight screening I attended) could take the movie seriously on its terms, even when it got crazy or violent, such as when the two organisms attack and kill one another in a bloody massacre in front of a packed audience at a science demonstration. But at a certain point Natali makes a decision to just make the movie lose its sense of direction.What was actually quite touching and deep becomes an exploitation movie in serious-horror clothing. The cinematography and music aren't decreased in quality in the last reel, but most of logic and its sense of 'anything's possible' either gets too whacked out or too by the numbers. It's painful to see that happen to a movie, or to its actors (very good Adrian Brody and even better Sarah Polly in a more meaty character), but it happens here. At the least, however, if one were to catch the bulk of this film on TV, it could catch you in its grip and not let go, for a little while, and at least that's something in an age of bland and boring remakes. It's a flawed but extremely well-crafted B movie.",Splice
13,Coventry,"Splish-Splice, I was playing for God",3,5 May 2017,"As hinted at via the lead characters' names (inspired by Colin CLIVE and ELSA Lanchester), ""Splice"" is basically just a 21st century update of the legendary ""Frankenstein"" tale. It's about scientists playing God and attempting to create new life without thinking about the possible consequences. The difference is of course that science and laboratories have evolved quite tremendously since Mary Shelley invented the immortal premise, and thus Boris Karloff's corpse has been replaced by microscopic bits of DNA and the resurrection process via lighting & thunderstorms has been replaced with a complicated splicing process that I don't even bother to understand. Call me old-fashioned, but this advanced and pseudo-intellectual kind of Sci-Fi is quite unappealing, pretentious and mostly boring. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley – their mediocre performances are undoubtedly still the best thing about the whole film – form a brilliant couple of scientists specialized in DNA research. For their employer, a massive pharmaceutical company called N.E.R.D (ha ha!), they are supposed to mix and merge DNA from various animal species and create a brand new organism. They do this quite successfully; with the creation of a pair of blobby critters they name Fred and Ginger, But Elsa wants to go even further. She persuades Clive to continue their experiments and even add human DNA into the cocktail, with as result the ""birth"" of a humanoid that looks like a rodent with amphibious lungs and a split forehead. Dren, as they name her, rapidly grows into a curious female and it soon becomes very difficult to keep her under control and hidden for the outside world. In spite of the intellectual and relevant subject matter, ""Splice"" is a surprisingly dumb and highly implausible film. The first half is still absorbing and eventful, with a disastrous press conference as gory highlight, but then it suddenly turns into a stupid, tedious and inconceivable mess. I fail to believe that a vivid and boisterous creature like Dren can possibly be kept hidden in the basement of a mastodon company without being noticed, and that's just the least annoying thing of everything that doesn't make sense! The script suddenly comes up with a sub plot about Elsa's troubled childhood, but that remains vague and random. The couple also constantly changes their minds and roles. At first Clive is reluctant and wants to destroy Dren while Elsa treats her lovingly like she nurtured it in her own womb. Later on, however, it's Clive who protects Dren from Elsa who wants to kill it with a shovel. Make up your damn minds! If all this isn't laughable enough yet, Clive naturally also copulates with his hamster-faced abomination. Pretty much like Dren herself, ""Splice"" is quite an abomination and I can't say I'm too surprised because even his more acclaimed movies ""Cube"" and ""Cypher"" were terribly overrated.",Splice

15,hitchcockthelegend,Brundledren!,6,2 December 2018,"Splice is a tricky picture to evaluate, for its ideas are superb. One could argue that it brings a new petri dish full of meddling scientists facing the consequences of their actions, while conversely it justifiably feels like a Cronenberg knock-off.Psychological discord is in abundance, with its slants on skew-whiff parenting giving the pic a dark fascination, and as unpleasant as the male fantasy angle is, it does hold a morbid interest factor.Yet come the final third the makers let things run away from them, the bonkers dangers of tampering with science giving way to daft schlock, even managing to be distasteful in the process - while the finale is a weak attempt at a ""TBC"" cliff hanger.Lead cast members are turning in good perfs. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley as the meddling science couple hold court well, and Delphine Chaneac as the Chimera splicer of the piece really nails all the various emotional strands required for a tricky role.Director Vincenzo Natali has shown with Cube and Cypher he has something to offer the horror/sci-fi splinters of film, but this is a mixed bag. A film of great ideas let down by overheating the plot for shock values, while the levity inserted into the play is misguided and damaging for dramatic worth. 6/10",Splice

Bio chemist scientists(and couple)Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley fool around with genetics by splicing animal and human DNA and the result will be devastating. Their work is supposed to be geared towards research which would lead to finding cures for all types of diseases and what these two create is a half-animal/half-human hybrid which is growing at an alarming rate. Polley grows attached to ""Dren""(backwards for Nerd), almost a mother/daughter bond but as ""she"" evolves we see that it is becoming more unpredictable and dangerous not to mention the eventual ""gender problem"" which develops. A culmination of excellent computer generated and make-up effects highlights this sci-fi horror outing where, once again, science creates a threat to human kind, proving that despite the reasons behind their methods and experiments, it seems when you fool around with genetics only bad can come from it. Some disturbing/weird sex(and especially a bizarre rape/impregnation)between Dren and Brody, and a haunting attack on Polley are featured in SPLICE. The evolution of Dren is quite amazing to behold, and seeing Polley nurturing and raising it with such love and care is particularly heartwrenching once she begins to change into a more malevolent creature.",Splice
17,Hey_Sweden,A decent enough cautionary tale.,6,22 October 2018,"Once again, scientists venture where they probably shouldn't have gone in this modern creature feature, yet another variation on a ""Frankenstein"" type story. It comes complete with the moral / ethical complications faced by those in certain areas of science, and what might actually be permissible in the name of progress and the benefit to mankind.Adrien Brody (""Predators"") and Sarah Polley (the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake) play Clive and Elsa - obvious nods to Colin Clive and Elsa Lanchester - in this tale of a superstar pair of researchers, lovers as well as co-workers. They've done some interesting things in terms of creating hybrids of other species, but want to go the next step and incorporate human DNA. Naturally, they don't receive the ""go ahead"" to do this, so they perform their experiment in secret. The result is ""Dren"" (French actress Delphine Chaneac, 'Transporter: The Series'), a sentient and intelligent humanoid being that grows rapidly.Co-written and directed by Vincenzo Natali of ""Cube"" fame, this is pretty standard stuff, for the most part; in fact, it is laughable at times. It's heavy-handed about its message, with Clive functioning as something of a voice of reason. (Even so, he's not exempt from questionable behaviour.) In less capable hands, Elsa would have been a pretty untenable character, but the lovely Ms. Polley makes her more understandable (if not sympathetic) than she would have been otherwise. Brody is good if not quite as effective. But the film really depends on some intriguing creature design, better than average CGI, and the remarkable performance of Chaneac, who helps to give ""Splice"" a genuine emotional component.Overall, a good and well-intentioned effort, not completely humourless but basically quite sombre. The acting helps carry it for a decently paced 104 minutes.Guillermo del Toro was one of the executive producers.Six out of 10.",Splice

The resulting animal human hybrid begins growing rapidly and there are complications.Hailed by some as a masterpiece of modern horror and by others as a mess I fall somewhere in the middle.The problem for me stems from the two leads played by Sarah Polley and Adrian Brody who are the two scientists. They are too cold and calculating too hard really like and its real easy to see their fall from hubris. On the other hand the film does create a certain amount of frisson from the situations. In a weird way the small creature (and the original species) are genuine creepy, especially intellectually. The film mostly manages to over come its weaknesses until the final half our or so when things begin to spiral out in well worn horror movie tropes.

The creature is female from the hips up and has chicken legs from the hips down with a particularly nasty tale that conceals a dangerous talon. This independently produced Canadian picture earned its R-rating because the female monster and one of the scientists, Clive (Adrien Brody of ""The Thin Red Line""), have sex together. Naturally, everybody dies, but the heroine Elsa (Sarah Polley) survives with a bun in her oven that bodes ill for the future. Executive producer Joel Silver has had a good track record with his horror film releases, but ""Splice"" has nothing going for it. Despite the special effects, this is not a polished film.

Sci-fi thriller hybrid of ""Frankenstein""; ""The Island of Dr. Moreau""/""Species"" and Cronenbergian fear of the flesh fantasia in this absorbing tale of genetic splicing gone amok in the careful-what-you-wish-for-don't – mess-with-Mother Nature – tropes that still are buoyed by strong acting from its leads Brody & Polley who face their biggest challenge in containing their latest creation – ""Dren"" (wonderfully portrayed by Chu as a child and kudos to the ethereal Chaneac as the full-grown 'adult') – whose unique blend of human DNA with many animal mutations results in a chilling cocktail of playing God for a price.

21,neil-476,Unrealised potential,7,29 July 2010,"I approached Splice with interest and trepidation: on the one hand, the advance visuals I had seen looked eye-catching, and the two UK newspaper reviews I had read were both positive but, on the other, I had heard fairly damning things from friends with shared tastes.What I found was a fairly standard plot - scientists, messing with things they shouldn't mess with, create a Frankenstein's monster (genetically rather than surgically), and this creature ends up going on a rampage.There was much here which I found worthwhile, First of all, the science - essentially a maguffin to facilitate the creation of Dren, the female (and moderately, though not exclusively, human) creature - comes across as fairly credible: it sounds, and looks, as if someone had done some homework before putting pen to paper, and this disguises the maguffin-ness very effectively, and mean that the science and business elements of the plot which run through the first half of the movie make this fairly interesting to follow. Secondly, Dren is a stunningly effective creation. A mixture of CGI add-ons to actress Delphine Chaneac, Dren is both alluringly attractive and profoundly, disturbingly non-human. And, during the centre section of the film, Dren is very close to becoming one of a select group of movie monsters which work because they are essentially pitiable: their monster status has come about through no fault of their own. Further, there are tantalising hints that Dren may well understand this.Then we come to the bits which aren't so good. There was scope to consider the ethical implications of using human DNA in research, but this got lost somewhere. There was scope to communicate with Dren, but this got overlooked in favour of the two scientists behaving like complete asses (and Dren's constant chirrupping became a profound irritant). The sudden appearance of scientist Sarah Polley's remote farmhouse and barn was lazy scriptwriting - this could easily have been introduced in a way where it wasn't so obviously ""Let's write a remote barn in"" response to a demand in the story. The scene where Dren seduces scientist Adrien Brody was very nearly the profoundly disturbing scene it should have been, but never quite made it. The hang-ups of the Sarah Polley character, and their impact on her actions, were never fully explored. And the final act descent into standard monster-on-a-rampage mode, complete with unsatisfying and not very credible plot twist, was a disappointment.That sums up the movie, really. The considerable potential never seemed to be fully developed, and the filmmakers, having put resources into a good set up, appeared to be content to let the whole thing devolve into something we've seen many times before.Oh, and I got irritated by the barn - snow is thick on the ground outside, you can see daylight between the boards making up the barn walls, and everybody is behaving as if it's summer inside.",Splice
22,evanston_dad,Mommie Dearest,7,14 January 2011,"In ""Splice,"" Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley play fellow scientists who fiddle around with genetic engineering to create a strange, animal/human hybrid named Dren. The characters played by Brody and Polley are named Clive and Elsa in a cheeky homage to the 1935 ""Bride of Frankenstein,"" in which Dr. Frankenstein was played by Colin Clive and the monster he creates is played memorably by Elsa Lanchester. Why then isn't it the monster in ""Splice"" that's named Elsa if we are drawing parallels to the 1935 film, and who says it isn't? For there's more than one kind of monster.""Splice"" settles into pedestrian mutant monster movie mode only in its last 15 minutes or so. The movie up to that point is a surprisingly clever, and even darkly funny, allegory for parenting. Obvious resemblances to films like ""Alien"" and ""It's Alive"" aside, the film ""Splice"" reminded me of most was David Lynch's ""Eraserhead,"" another uncomfortably funny film that takes the idea of the responsibility of parenthood to literally nightmarish extremes. As Dren evolves from fetus to newborn to teenager to sexually mature adult, we watch Clive and Elsa struggle with the challenge of a once-dependent being who begins to have a mind of its own. And as the movie evolves, we also begin to understand who the real monster is, as Elsa takes the old ""I brought you into this world and I can take you out of it"" parental maxim a little too literally.""Splice"" also obliquely raises a lot of ethical and moral questions about such hot-button issues as abortion, artificial means of conception, genetic tampering, etc., but it does so with a light touch and doesn't make any preachy points.It's a surprisingly satisfying movie in a genre that doesn't generally lead one to expect much.Grade: B+",Splice

But, as every parent discovers, their ""daughter"" is not really controllable. And unlike a real human being, Dren has some pretty wicked animal powers that augment her tantrums.

24,trashgang,Frankenstein anno 2010,5,18 August 2010,"I wont say that it is a great movie, therefore it lacks on gore or suspense. Wait a minute. I would categorize it under science fiction horror. In fact it's the story of Frankenstein updated to 2010. When superstar genetic engineers Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley) specialize in splicing together DNA from different animals to create incredible new creatures they want to know what would happen, in secret, if they splice DNA from that creature with human DNA. The first hour of the movie it's all about looking at the created thing with love and understanding but just like Frankenstein, things start to go wrong. Dren, as it is called turns against her creators. When that happens we are too far into the movie to say that we have a gem. The last 40 minutes things starts happening, a bit too late but what happens looks okay. The CGI is excellent and doesn't bother at all even for me , an old school FX man. Delphine Chanéac also as Dren gives a good performance, even with her CGI body. If you aren't bothered with the first part being a bit too long than you can watch it easily but if you are into gore or real horror than it isn't really for you at all, if you could only 'splice' the movie and watch the second part it would be a gem.",Splice
25,siderite,Never has a mad scientist been more frightening than when she's female,7,26 August 2010,"The movie was at once original and disappointing. I have to admit that I harbored great expectations since I have been waiting for a year for the release of the film. So no wonder that I felt a bit cheated when the script proved to be not that brilliantly written and the actors didn't play so well. I mean, they are Canadian... how dare they act badly?!What is this about? It one of those movies warning against ""playing God"". Plain and simple bullshit, as always. However, the film really started well with the strained power relation of the two scientists that are also a pair and Sarah Polley playing her usually bossy, annoying as hell, mentally deranged self. I did notice that all semblance of scientific decorum has been thrown into the garbage bin, but I was still hoping that the frantic pace of the script is only due to the necessity of placing us into a good starting point for the real idea of the film.But soon I was to be disappointed, as the plot wobbled between ideas that were both rushed and not thoroughly explored. The ideas themselves were worthy of respect, but the movie failed to capitalize them and ended as a low budget version of Species. And I can't believe they didn't give David Hewlett a more prominent role!Bottom line: a lot of promise that failed to deliver. It was hardly scary and the small bits that were were so remote from reality that they did nothing to suspend disbelief.

29,sddavis63,Ethical Dilemmas Galore!,8,16 March 2012,"Interesting that I chose to watch this just days after I saw a news report that a team of Russian and Korean scientists are going to try to re-create a woolly mammoth. To me, that report was ethically troubling, and that report jumped into my head very early on in this movie. ""Splice"" is also chock-full of ethical dilemmas, many of which mirror the real-life dilemmas that are front and centre today. To name just a few: abortion, euthanasia, animal research, stem cell research, the profit motive behind medical research. All of these (and more) play a central role in the development of this movie. ""Splice"" is an enjoyable and ethically challenging movie, and it does force you to confront within yourself all of these ethical dilemmas that are around us right at this very moment.Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley are the stars as Clive and Elsa - two young scientists working for a company looking to genetic research to develop now wonder drugs by ""splicing"" together the genes of various animals. Having ""created"" a new form of (unrecognizable) life to be mined in this research, Clive and Elsa want to take the experiment one step further by introducing human DNA into the equation, but the company objects - not so much for ethical reasons, but because they need to see some financial return on the work that's been done to date. Forbidden by the company to go farther, Clive and Elsa work secretly and produce a human-like creature, spliced together with a variety of other creatures, whom they eventually name Dren. With the ethical dilemmas already front and centre the movie then becomes the story of the relationship between the three, and there's great mystery involved with that, because we don't know exactly what Dren is or what she's capable of. Is she an uncontrollable wild animal with a degree of human intelligence, or is she more human and civilized? The ethical dilemmas worked quite well to keep my attention, and Brody and Polley worked pretty well in their roles. The other characters in the movie were quite secondary and not really of any great importance, except to the extent that they all represented facets of the ethical dilemma.So far, so good, but the movie weakened substantially in the last 20 minutes or so. What had been a rather thought-provoking story ended up being turned into a not especially interesting monster movie, and all we basically did for that last stretch was wait to see who (if anyone) was going to survive, and the ending was extremely predictable. There were also a handful of plot points that bugged me. I thought the character of Elsa changed much too quickly and easily from Dren's protector and mother figure to - well - a cold hearted, abusive scientist, quite frankly. That evolution was far too fast to be believable. The scene in which Clive and Dren have sex was troubling on a number of fronts, and really - in the overall context of the movie - served virtually no purpose except to make me (and I suspect many who watched the movie) think ""gross!"" I also have to say that, while I liked Brody and Polley and there's nothing in particular about their performances that I can point to that didn't work, for some reason I still found them less than credible as super-scientists.Still, even though the ending weakened the movie considerably in my opinion, I still enjoyed it, if only because it made an effort to deal with the hot-button issues we still face in a thought-provoking and entertaining manner.

30,thesar-2,A Hundred Movies Spiced Together,3,10 September 2010,"I'm presuming they don't care if people compare Splice to, I don't know, countless other movies. From Frankenstein to Re-Animator, from The Fly II to Species, from It's Alive to Jurassic ParkSplice just simply isn't original. Again, I'm sure they expected the typical critique of the spent idea and was hoping for audiences to look past it and concentrate on the story and characters.WAY unfortunately, I found the characters completely uninteresting and the story incredibly uninspiring and since the movie tries so hard and rests mostly on both Brody and Polley's shoulders, I expected more.I admit as much as I am a Polley fan (Go, Dawn of the Dead) I'm the exact opposite with Brody (King Kong, Predators.) In fact, I simply can't stand him. Now, that doesn't stop me from watching his movies and putting aside my distaste of him and his acting to watch his movies – I thought he was decent in Predators. Regrettably, he's back to his bland acting here and at times was unwatchable.Thank goodness for Polley, then right? I love her. I really do. Here, her character was so all over the place that I question if that was her fault. Here she's smart, here she's short-sighted, here she wants to be a mother and here is her unconvincingly 15-second background. You really couldn't side with her, nor hate her and worse, you could care less if she succeeds or not.Enough about themthe movie also rests on the shoulders of special effects. Not once did I NOT believe the creature both Elsa (Polley) or Clive (Brody) created existed. That takes a lot of talent and know-how. Sadly, it, or ""Dren"" – HA! it's Nerd spelled backwards, ah, hem – played mostly by Chanéac, was just plainboring. Yeah, yeah, I get the beeps or squeal she makes, but the bobbing of the head, the ""learning,"" etc, was not only insipid but didn't hold my interest farther than if I studied goldfish for more than 3 minutes.So, I'll give them kudos for at least the special effects and also for the music and scoreother than that, there's simply not much more here. I didn't hate the age old story of a couple who want to experiment with splicing DNAs together to make blob monsters and into humansbut I certainly never want to see it again.I really can't recommend it. The story is all over the place, ideas begin and fizzle, the dialogue average at best, the emotions way below that. They were just going through the motions. SKIP IT.",Splice
31,Robert_duder,A really twisted and bleak sci fi horror film that will leave your skin crawling...in various ways,6,25 July 2010,"Rumor has it that Splice is a loose remake of the terrible so called cult classic 'It's Alive.' Its bad to base your new film off of really terrible base product. Still Splice is better than that original material and manages to be even more strange and creepy in good ways and in not so good ways. The special effects are really well done especially on the beast herself and a few other great visual experiments. The story isn't complex and moves at a fast pace but the concept is so bizarre and several of the scenes (especially towards the end) are so twisted you'll feel like you need a shower when you leave the theatre. Splice is entertaining. I mean I didn't find it terrible to watch and yet it doesn't really make you 'enjoy' it per se. I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again. It shouldn't surprise that the writing team of director Vincenzo Natali, Antoinette Terry Bryant, and Doug Taylor don't have a lot of professional credits to their name. This usually means that they are putting together something that the three of them find amusing without thought to the potential millions that will be watching this.The cast for the film is decent enough. However, Adrien Brody doesn't exactly wow as genetic scientist Clive. Brody is moody and angry and pontificates a lot and has one of the most disturbing and bizarre scenes in anything I have ever seen. This is definitely not his genre of film. Sarah Polley is perhaps the saving performance in the film. She is actually very good as Brody's Scientist wife Elsa. The character is far more uplifting (in the beginning) and just shows more emotion overall. You actually believe her transition throughout the film and she manages to make the relationships look legitimate. Looking at actual pictures of the actress Delphine Chanéac who plays genetically created beast Dren actually gives me chills because there is no doubt that Chanéac does a brilliant job playing the...girl...thing. Her movements, facial expressions, and emotions with her eyes are brilliant. She is the soul reason to see this film because Dren and her transformations throughout the film are the only reason the film scores a 6 and not a 1 in my books.I don't blame director Vincenzo Natali for the mess that the film ends up being. In fact I think the entire problem is that the film just goes too far. I mean when you're ending the film with a transformed beast like thing raping a main character and I mean no fade to black, no camera panning full on rape scene...it just felt weird and wrong and it made you despise the entire film. Still something has to be said for director Natali who does keep the story moving, there is some very good cinematography, and the film is shot well. Its only in concept of the story where it falls apart and the very weak performance from Brody. Taking the characters to the barn and farm setting is perfect but by the time you add in the negatives the positives barely matter at all. An unfortunate sci-fi flick that will get watched only because the rumour of the bizarre sex scenes will spread. But trust me...you're missing nothing. 6/10",Splice

33,bowmanblue,"Splice, Splice, Baby!",8,25 May 2015,"I've just watched 'Splice' for the second time. The first time I saw it, I hired it on DVD. After that viewing, I bought it and have now seen it again. So, basically, I do think it's a good enough film to watch more than once. However, now I've decided to write a review, no sooner have I logged on to see what other people thought, did I read another review's title saying something like, 'Good beginning, not so good end.' That pretty much sums up my thoughts on the film.I enjoyed the first two thirds, but I didn't feel that it fell apart towards the end. I would definitely say that it's worth watching for the most part. Adrian Broody and Sarah Polley play a couple of scientists who create a creature in a lab, but, in the tradition of all mad scientists, they take things a little too far. In this case they even take their creation home with them and it grows into quite an interesting beast.You can probably guess that their new 'addition' to their family is hardly a glowing success (otherwise it would be a pretty dull film!), so I won't say too much. It's a sort of sci-fi/horror film that does its best to throw in a few moral dilemmas that scientists have to face when it comes to how far they take their work in the lab.What makes it worth watching are the two leads. In what could have been just another B-movie the cast elevates it to something a little more. They have good chemistry and their acting talent certainly makes the script better than your average slasher flick. Then you have the creature itself. Yes, for its infancy it is computer generated. And you probably would be forgiven for thinking that the effects might look a bit ropey. Actually, they're pretty good. And, once the creature is fully-grown it gets replaced by a live actor (in make-up) who is equally as 'interesting' (for use of a better word) to look at.Like I say, 'Splice' has a lot going for it. The first two thirds are up there with the best of them when it comes to creepy horror. The final act does tend to degenerate into something a little more clichéd that doesn't do the build-up justice. But the first two thirds were good enough for me to invest in the film.

It's very similar to the incredibly stupid 1995 movie Species as well as having many shades of Guillermo Del Toro's Mimic (Del Toro served as producer on this film too) but plays it straight enough for it to be taken seriously in its own right.Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley play scientists/lovers working for a pharmaceutical company hoping to find cures for various diseases by splicing human DNA with that of various other creatures. They eventually create Dren, a female born from a fake uterus who initially looks like a blind, hairless rabbit. She soon grows arms and eyes and resembles a little girl, quickly after that she looks like a young woman and is treated mostly as a human, mostly.What bothered me about the film is that Dren is frequently treated pretty badly. She cannot talk, instead relying on squeaks and facial expressions, and should be treated like the newborn she actually is. But the pretty poor scientists who created her really ought to be charged with animal/human cruelty. If repeatedly slapping a bad dog with a newspaper creates an unstable animal...Splice doesn't really have many tricks up its sleeve. Vincenzo Natali plays the dead/not dead card way too many times and never really lets us into the mind of Dren. When the movie isn't trying to be a horror its an interesting study of the would-be human development of Dren and the emotions she provokes from those around her.

For starters while it remained watchable throughout, I couldn't help but feel a sense of blandness among things. I was never really fully intrigued like I should have been, considering the potential of the story. The finale runs on too long, and I couldn't get behind the central characters (Brody and Polley) Due to there selfish natures. Sci-Fi has always been a genre I've been very picky on. I look for original, exciting story lines and felt none of that here. The creature itself (Dren) isn't as effective as it should be either. Each time I started to get fully interested, it pulled me back into that blandness. Far from a horrible film, just an average one.Performances. Adrien Brody is solid, but his character isn't as deep as it should have been, with more proper writing, I could have gotten behind him better. Sarah Polley is easy to look at, but her character is hard to take. I couldn't stand her selfish nature, and her chemistry with Brody felt awkward. Delphine Chanéac is creepy at times as the creature, annoying at others. I felt too much of an imbalance.Bottom line. Perhaps you'll groove to this one more than I did.

39,tabuno,An Intelligent and Gripping Psychological Sci Fi Thriller,9,19 January 2019,"31 January 2010. SPLICE is to AVATAR (2009) as intellectually and uniquely alien as to action, blockbuster extravaganza. For all the dazzling visual effects of AVATAR, SPLICE goes beyond and enters the genuine sci fi realm of the hard core mental and emotional turmoil of the strangely, unpredictable unknown and captures the essence of sci fi that AVATAR fails to do. In many respects the blockbuster AVATAR pales in comparison to this intensely visceral scary movie. One of the most fascinating elements of this movie is that while it may appear to address the nature/nurture, sci fi conundrum of DNA splicing and gene manipulation, a further examination really leaves the question open for debate. The Julianne Moore look-a-like and Adrien Brody play scientists who embark on a controversial and what turns out to be an unpredictable, funny, and scary exploration and experience with a new life form that is incredible. Additionally there are for some, abhorrent scenes that raise additional moral/ethical questions. This truly remarkable movie does almost, if not, in a few places cross the boundaries of the absurd plot points particularly in Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley's behavior, nevertheless the new life form and its evolution is a marvelous and frightening experience that truly enters into a new threshold on the sci fi screen. With remote resemblance to some of the elements found in ALIEN (1979) and THE ARRIVAL (1996), the pacing is excellent, the horror elements are great. The only problem is the consistent authenticity of the two main characters throughout the movie that give rise to a few script questions. Nevertheless, this movie is a breakthrough for being able to capture the core of the unknown in a deeply emotive, wondrous, and haunting fashion.Some audience members may question the second half of this movie, but personally, the entire nature of science sometimes is the horrific jump into the unknown and unpredictable. Sometimes the jump leads to glorious results and sometimes to the most terrible nightmarish ones. This movie reflects the underbelly of pure science and the emotional highs and the possible disastrous lows that awaits anyone who dares to venture into a new level of exploration on whatever level. What we ""expect"" both in life and in a movie, and this movie in particular isn't necessarily what we expect or want, nevertheless this fictional movie has more to teach us about the ""real"" than what most of us expect.",Splice

41,johnnyboyz,"Cutting to the centre of its characters and its larger, more upscale ideas; Splice is a fine slice of thriller film-making with essence of science fiction.",7,18 March 2011,"Splice covers two top scientists at the height of their game, a young heterosexual pair whom double up as a couple and happen to be leading individuals within their respective field, constantly trying to push boundaries when they aren't already breaking through them. American filmmaker Vincenzo Natali's film is the covering of these two people as they venture beyond the infinite, as they ill advisedly journey further within the field of their respective research than what we're led to believe any two people have ever before done so. It might be fair to say that, by the final twenty or so minutes, at which point Splice appears to be drawing on inspiration from the Jeepers Creepers films, the piece has mutated into a man-meets-monster project set in the rural wilderness and encompassing particular 'slasher' tendencies. It should also be noted that the film is a rich and mature study of science going a long way to being deeply flawed, a rich character study depicting two people whose lives outside of their work parameters become inexplicably entwined with their lives inside of their work parameters; culminating in a stretch reminiscent of all those shoddy teenaged orientated horror flicks you've seen, but this time with great depth and involvement added instead.The two scientists are Adrian Brody's Clive Nicoli and Sarah Polley's Elsa Kast; hardworking, dangerously advanced people working at an American company named, perhaps somewhat unrealistically, NERD – an abbreviation for Nucleic Exchange Research and Development. Nicoli and Kast are unmarried but in a healthy relationship, their disagreements and discussions during most of the experimentation we see them carry out in Splice underpinned with that indelible sense of a long-suffering couple bickering as they effectively squabble over the breakthroughs which will come to define how a generation of scientists and researchers come to form their own work. Already, these two NERD heavy weighter's have bred new life; experiments of which we, the audience, are quite literally born into when the process of delivering one of their creations, these odd maggot-like creatures whom ease and ooze their way around their tanks formed from species of numerous parts of DNA from numerous Earth animals, is the opening sequence of the film. They're ready for the next level, a level of which involves the placing of human DNA into proceedings. Holding them back are the officials, people that always greet the screen in very low level lighting and come equipped with short, sharp, blunt statements as they wear their greyed out, aesthetically displeasing suits - a French speaking middle aged female official of whom demands the experimentation be kept to where it is.In stark contrast to the boring, overly methodical and 'no-no' nature of the often conference room dwelling suits are the scientists; their youthful exuberance, good-looks and rooted connection to one another seeing Kast and Nicoli already a couple, as well as Nicoli's brother Gavin (McGibbon) working with him within his department for good measure. The next level is where the pair want to go, the verbal confirmation outside of the offices of which is the catalyst for the two of them to formally reject an alternative they deduce will consist of working for some other company doing work far more menial in comparison to what they've got going on here.There is a very short scene encompassing the moral and ethic ramifications of what it is they're doing in forming this new breed of life; once over, the pair of them start to work with some human DNA installed into the formula with which they've been working. A while later and after some uncomfortable scenes a nosocomephobic nature, which director Vincenzo Natali clearly enjoys constructing but constructs well, a female creature is born; an armless creature of about the size of a chicken whom you'd have to say resembles an ostrich. It grows up into a five and a half feet or so tall specimen and is eventually named Dren, played by French actress Delphine Chanéac, whom impressively combines the physical elegance and grace of Milla Jovovich's character from 1997's The Fifth Element with a chaotic and unnerving sense of the danger she still carries, all the while maintaining a bestial, abnormal and falsified sense of existence.Natali's awareness of the rich characterisation he's dealing with here shines through; the item of both Kast and Nicoli deliberating introducing a child to their cosy set up causing ripples in the relationship when Nicoli thinks it would be a good idea and Kast doesn't, but placed on the buck-burner anyway. Additionally, Nicoli and his brother, despite being adults, appear inclined more towards material or items of culture of a more teenaged orientation; Nicoli's array of colourful, bouncy T-shirts accompanying a string of animated Japanese cartoon posters and an apparent fondness for your more juvenalised rock music. The nature of the film, and its ideas explored through its confrontational subject matter to do with an immense amount of responsibility suddenly falling to these people twinned with the parental role Nicoli must suddenly take on, aids in furthering his character away from said mindset and into a more adult person. For Kast, a rather touching subplot to do with her own childhood lived out of town in a ruralised zone encompassing a ranch more broadly links that of what it is they eventually create's own upbringing; the mothering role Kast takes on once out there and with Dren effectively the role she once herself did not have as an individual Dren's age. Splice is simple but engaging enough, stripped down science fiction encompassing a great deal of interest and impressively dealing with contemporary issues within our own world of science maturely and subtly; mutating everything into an accomplished thriller.",Splice
42,TheMovieDiorama,Splice exudes scientific jargon that amounts to stupidity.,5,24 February 2018,"DNA splicing is a hot topic, taking characteristics from other organisms to create an entirely new one that theoretically should be superior. That's all well and good, but when that concept is executed to such mediocrity you can't help but feel underwhelmed. In Splice, two scientists take it upon themselves to splice human DNA into an artificial organism, as an experiment. The company they work for strictly prohibited this, and so they must monitor the experiment in secret. Consequently making such a creature will have disastrous outcomes right? Well, when it's in the hands of two of the most idiotic scientists in the world...yes. That's where my massive problem lies, the stupidity of certain characters and actions. You can't backup an intelligent concept, where our scientists consistently shout out random amino acids and proteins, with simple plain idiocy. Firstly following the experiment through was stupid anyway, so much so that the characters realise their mistake (in the aura of 'Frankenstein'). Torturing it to a point where they physically cause it emotional distress. Unable to keep hold of it, to which it escapes...in the woods...the outside world...the general population. It's just so stupid to a point that it becomes a detriment to the believability of the story. Which ultimately is a shame as the concept is there, all the ingredients are presented to them on a shiny plate. Just frustratingly combined together to create a sour dish. You can tell Del Toro produced this, the hint of dark fantasy and themes of motherhood and maturity are embedded within, which I appreciated. Brody and Poller make the best of a lacklustre script. The ending was...well, bold? Ummm...yeah, unusual and grotesque simultaneously. It is an engaging sci-fi thriller, but the implausibility and stupidity of certain aspects prevent this from being good. Moral of the story: Don't be a self-righteous scientist, it will be your downfall.",Splice
43,Chris Knipp,"""It's alive"" -- again (Who knew that 'French woman' was an alien species?)",6,4 June 2010,"Lisa Schwartzbaum of Entertainment Weekly enthusiastically describes 'Splice' as ""A cheeky, great-looking, thoughtfully loopy creature feature about the lure and dangers of cutting-edge gene splicing."" Somewhere near the other extreme we have Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post, who calls the movie ""a thoroughly repulsive science fiction-horror flick that slicks up its B-movie tawdriness with high-gloss production values and two otherwise classy stars."" They're both right, at least if ""thoughtfully loopy"" means silly, but not completely dumb. And both production values and promotional possibilities are indicated by Guillermo del Toro's name in the executive producer slot. Despite the charismatic stars, however, when it's all balanced out, 'Splice' has some virtues for genre followers, but otherwise is unexceptional.This movie gets both repulsive and preposterous in the first few scenes. Elsa (Sarah Polley) and Clive (Adrien Brody) are a biochemist couple who do experimental gene splicing for a Big Pharma corporation. They create two great repulsive worm-like things they call Ginger and Fred, wrinkly, gnarly abominations like faceless and limbless pigs, which are supposed to be the wonderful new source of a wealth of proteins and enzymes usable for medicines. Ginger and Fred look like some CGI gone horribly wrong. Against their corporate boss's prohibitions, Elsa sneaks off and goes one step further: she grows a critter that blends mammal, fish, bird, and human DNA. The thing that comes out, exploding and spewing disgusting fluids, of course, looks like a giant man-eating tadpole, or a flying snake. In time it gives birth to a little fledgling that grows up into a kind of bald, sweet-faced lesbian on spindly bird legs and Dren, as they name her, grows quickly from a child into a squeaky adult that can't seem to speak but can spell out words like ""boring"" and ""outside"" in Scrabble letters. The monster catch: Elsa's and Clive's critters not only slide back and forth between species. They also tend to switch genders unexpectedly. And since they have sharp little poisonous spider tails, they're dangerous when aroused.Dren (played as an adult by French film actress Delphine Chanéac) is scary and dangerous, but also kind of cuddly. At first the childless Elsa develops an unprofessionally motherly approach, but then Dren grows up with breathtaking speed into (as Variety's Justin Chang puts it) ""a cross between Gollum and Sinnead O'Connor,"" with a pretty face and, at times, a winning smile. You can see where this is going. When this movie was shown as a midnight feature in the San Francisco film festival the festival director Graham Leggett said it had ""the best inter-species sex scene ever."" Dr. Frankenstein's ""monster,"" where all this came from, longed to be accepted as human. It didn't expect to have sex with people, but this is another era, with a different and greater focus on sex, morality, and economics. Only a post-millennial movie would end with one of the scientists being offered an unbelievably large check for their taboo-flouting experiments.'Splice' is Sci-Fi that's scary and gross-out, though in an era when CGI allows spatter to be moved to an exponential level (even the low-budget 'District 9' outdoes 'Splice' both in species-shifting and yucky-fluid spraying), the main thing it has to offer is the frisson of copulation with a non-human. And thanks to CGI, ""she"" can go amphibian, spout wings and retract them, and change sexes. I guess Adrien Brody, with his aquiline features and long body, has an edge of the alien himself. But when he puts on a record and slow-dances with Dren one evening while Elsa's away, is it gross-out, titillating, or just plain silly? Or maybe it's the call of the abyss? All these things at once, this is the film's best moment. Otherwise, how is this any better than the Spierig brother's zombie movie of earlier this year, 'Daybreakers'? That too had a couple of A-listers, Ethan Hawke and Willem Dafoe, raising the B-picture tone. And with its dark zombie-infested future world re-imagined in Forties noir style and its own bloody explosions and scary flying monsters, it was just as imaginatively engaging.'Splice' is thin stuff. What it's got is a couple of actors in Brody and Polley who make their relationship come to life. And Polley is a little bit scary herself. That's all.Modern Frankenstein stories lack the melancholy of the old movies that stayed close to the original Mary Shelley story. Elsa and Clive don't seem to care a bit that they're messing with God's scheme of things. They're just worried to death they'll get found out -- and maybe lose their jobs. Other than Brody and Polley's, there are no characters of more than minimal depth in 'Splice'; Dren comes across as a creature more of voracious appetites than feeling. Clive has his brother Gavin (Brandon McGibbon), a lower-level scientist at the lab, who of course finds out what the couple is up to and makes things more complicated.'Splice' got a jump-start for its critical rep by debuting at Sundance. Graham Leggett put his finger on its main selling-point. Sure, in horror/Sci-Fi terms it has two good selling points: decent actors and production values (but is either a necessity for the genre?) and sex. First Dren craves sweets, then she wants Clive. Then, like all cinematic human efforts to tamper with Mother Nature in the movies, things go haywire. I'm not saying this movie doesn't deliver, only that there's nothing profound about it.",Splice
44,Polaris_DiB,Bioengineering concept doesn't go much further than initial assumptions,6,27 August 2010,"I almost wish this weren't a horror movie. Vincenzo Natalie fills the first third of this movie with so many visual puns, witty quips, and sight gags that you take the young scientists at work (Clive and Elsa, themselves references to Bride of Frankenstein), as a sort of nerdy teenager couple (yes, they work at NERD) trying to figure out parenting with this strange unique creation they made. However, because their bioengineered baby demon also stands in for our cultural conflict with biological experimentation and its possible uses and abuses in the first place, eventually everything has to go crashing down and thus the horror genre and it's creepy soundtrack devices must be used. The best thing that Natalie has going for him in this movie is that he doesn't overdo the jump cuts. In most mainstream director's hands, this thing would have had SHOCK!CAT!SHOCK! cutting throughout, but Natalie lets things happen sometimes and allows the characters some room to explore and develop, especially Dren. This is a good thing.Still, Dren was enough of an interesting character that there was more she could have been used for than ultimately what she did. For instance, she shows a rapid ability to learn how to read and spell and draw, but they never give her books, movies, or anything but a record to sort of reach outside the small spaces they leave her in. As such, since Dren can't move around, we instead focus a lot more on Adrien Brody's and Sarah Polley's characters, who are more interesting for the fact that they're some of the few young scientists shown in cinema who turn up at the lab in their pajamas (this happens more often in real life than one would think, and honestly though I could feel some snarky reviewer types watching this movie and being displeased with imagining nerdy indie kids as scientists, it's a more accurate portrayal than the typical mad scientist outlook). Clive and Dren's little romance itself became the real brunt of the movie, not Dren's creepy lizard movements or alien nature, beginning with a great moment of Primal Scene.Ultimately, the story was told backwards. Natalie begins the movie from the perspective of the strange wormy characters that the scientists created first, and he should have kept the movie from Dren's perspective from the point of birth on. Before that was mostly tongue-in-cheek jokes of technobirth, including this really amazing shot of Sarah Polley's hand breaching the mechanical womb as the water literally breaks all over the floor.It's not all that bad of a movie but ultimately it never expands upon its initial concept.--PolarisDiB",Splice
45,dfranzen70,"Dislikeable leads, idiocy",3,9 June 2010,"Splice, the story of what happens when the two of the world's dumbest scientists smush together the DNA of a human and an animal, is the kind of movie that starts out silly and becomes more preposterous as it proceeds. It's filled with dislikeable, unsympathetic yahoos and is riddled with implausible decisions. It's generally a waste of time.Elsa (Sarah Polley) and Clive (Adrien Brody) are hotshot researchers who are attempting to create a new lifeform, which they will then use to solve mankind's disease problems, like Alzheimer's and Down Syndrome. They're successful, of course, but the success gives Elsa the idea of splicing together some human DNA and that of a human. You know, to see what will happen, document the amazing awesomeness of said result, and learn from the experiment.But, as you might gather, something goes wrong – Elsa becomes emotionally attached to her creation, which for some reason she and Clive must keep hidden in a giant barn, far away from the prying eyes of their supervisors, who stereotypically want results now now now, so they can sell something.The first problem I have with the movie is that Elsa and Clive aren't exactly Good People. They're dedicated scientists, sure, but they're doing the wrong things for the wrong reasons. Ethics apparently wasn't a required course wherever these two received their medical degrees, because they continually break the rules for their own advancement. And let's be clear about that – this isn't about them breaking unjust rules, or doing something likewise noble, it's about flouting conventional wisdom and the sanctity of scientific process for the sake of who knows what.The second problem is that even though these two aren't really sympathetic, there's still no evildoer against whom we can root. Their corporate overlords, the ones who bankroll all their research, are bad only in the sense that they expect results. This doesn't seem unreasonable to me, but I think we're meant to believe it's a horrible thing and that the suits upstairs are evil little demons. It's just not so, though; if anyone's wronged in this movie, it's the evil corporate overlords, and that's not what you look for in a movie, typically.Finally, it does seem that every decision that either Clive or Elsa (but mostly Elsa, sadly) makes is the obviously terrible one. At one point Clive remarks that ""it's no longer about the science,"" referring to Elsa's obsession with their creation. The trouble is that it never was about the science. From the practically the first scene, everything they do has a nonscientific basis of reasoning. For hotshot science people, these two make their decisions based on emotions and little else. There's no evidence of thinking through their experiment and its consequences, intended or not; they don't even seem concerned with putting up safeguards.Did I mention this new creature is part animal – and yet at no point do we learn what animal? Turns out – no spoiler – it's not one, but several animals. And it never occurred to these doofuses that bad things might happen? That the defense mechanism of one animal might kick in? And, lest we forget, human DNA was also used. Humans are extremely violent and adaptable, so let's combine their ingenuity with the tenacity and savagery of other animals – plus give them the gifts of flight and underwater breathing, and wouldn't that be fun? Yikes. From laughable dialogue to a terrible, predictable finale, Splice is a loser on most levels. Polley and Brody seem earnest, but they're overwhelmed by the rancid, dopey plot.",Splice
46,PWNYCNY,This movie is worth watching.,8,10 June 2010,"Usually when Hollywood dabbles in topics as complex as cloning, the results are often laughable. Grotesque monsters, campy acting, and suspension of credibility usually abound as directors have a field day introducing the most fantastic special effects in their attempt to entertain the audience. This movie avoids those pitfalls. This movie is one of the better ones of the science fiction genre. Scientists dabble in unauthorized research producing unintended results. Though at times bordering on the far-fetched, the movie avoids becoming a goof and treats the subject matter with a certain measure of respect, thus telling a story that does not completely insult one's intelligence. The test of this occurs during the scene where the one of the scientists gets a bit too intimately involved with their experiment, which could have provoked laughter if less skillfully directed. The acting is strong, the special effects toned down and the story is comprehensible without becoming simplistic. This movie explores ethical issues relating to the nature of scientific research, especially that driven by the quest for profit. This is a movie worth watching.The movie raises an interesting question: is it permissible to have sexual relations with a clone?",Splice

Of course, we knew the two prototypes would kill each other, and we knew that that creature ""Dren"" would rape it's creator/mother after it changed genders.

48,estebangonzalez10,An original idea with a predictable ending,3,11 August 2010,"¨Science's Newest Miracle ... Is A Mistake¨ I really wanted to like this movie more than what I did because it began with such promise and the concept was very interesting, but as the film developed it just got predictable and the ending could be seen coming miles away. I was disappointed at how this sci-fi film became so predictable after the first half. At first it seems to be a film paying tribute to ¨The Bride of Frankenstein¨ with a very similar premise, but more believable now considering the modern scientific advancements in genetics to create a clone combining animal and human DNA. Even the main characters names, Colin and Elsa, were chosen to honor the actors who played Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive) and the bride (Elsa Lanchester). I wasn't too happy about Splice and can't compare it to that classic because it just doesn't resolve the way an original sci-fi film should. Splice seemed to take all the modern day conventions of movies near the end and lose all its originality in the process. Director Vincenzo Natali, mostly known for his 1997 film Cube, has an interesting idea but can't find a decent way to resolve the movie. He wrote the screenplay along with Antoinette Terry Bryant and Doug Taylor and at first they focused on the ethical dilemma of cloning this being, the psychological elements of parenthood and family, but later focused more on Colin and Elsa then on their creation itself. I really hated the ending and the movie felt so long even though it only lasts an hour and forty minutes. I was disappointed with Splice.Clive Nicoli (Adrien Brody) works as a scientist in N.E.R.D., a corporation that specializes in genetic research, along with his partner Elsa Kast (Sarah Polley). They work in a genetic lab where they splice several animal genes in order to create a protein that can be sold in the market. The experiment goes well so Clive and Elsa want to further their research, but the leaders at NERD want them to stick to this experiment and sell the protein because they can't have any more expenses. Elsa ignores her bosses and along with Clive continue to experiment on several animal genes. They add a human gene as well in order to speed up the process and the result is a new living organism that develops at an amazing rate. At first Clive wants to destroy the creature, but Elsa protects it and convinces him to let it grow since it will die soon anyway because of the speed with which it develops. The creature takes the shape of a little girl mixed with some animal parts, and Elsa treats her as a kid more than an actual experiment and even names her Dren (Nerd spelled backwards). As she grows, Elsa and Clive have to take her to a barn where they keep her locked out from the world. Dren (Delphine Chaneac) has human needs, such as need for affection, love and being cared for, but at the same time she has some violent reactions and she gets harder to control. Clive and Elsa will soon discover that it wasn't right for them to mess with mother nature.There are some interesting elements that Vicenzo plays along with here, such is the case with how life changes with parenting. First Dren finds love and nurturing from her mother, but as she grows older she becomes more fond of her father, but the film decides to abandon these psychological and moral issues and tries to have a more Hollywood friendly ending. Don't go into Splice expecting a Horror film, because it doesn't have any scares, the central theme of the film is this sci-fi and psychological study. Delphine Chaneac does a decent job playing this creature, but the rest of the cast I wasn't too excited about. Adrien Brody is far from his Pianist days and Sarah Polley was very weak as well. Splice had tremendous potential, but it really lost my interest and it is not a film I would want to watch ever again. I can see how many critics enjoyed this film because it pays tribute to some classic Lynch (Eraserhead), Polanski (Rosemary's Baby) and Cronenberg (The Fly) films. The film actually focused more on Elsa, then on Dren and I think we all wished it developed Dren's character a little more instead of Elsa. Anyways this is a film I won't be recommending or ever watching again for that matter despite the decent reviews it has been given from the critics.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Splice

52,aidanratesmovies,"It's not terrible, not much good either",6,19 July 2020,"At times intelligent, at times dimwitted, Splice is a messy genre bender that doesn't seem to know what to do with its intricate plot. The pacing is done well enough, I certainly never felt bored during the movie, but I had a hard time figuring out how the movie was trying to make me feel. Its tone is a bit all over the place, varying from a dark horror film, to sci-fi, to romance, and so many other genre blends that will make you question what they were trying to make throughout the process. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley give the most of their performances, but their dialogue often makes it hard to watch at times. Its premise is very interesting, but the plot of the film kinda goes all over the place, and as the film goes on, it looses the touch of brilliance that made it so clever. In the end, Splice is a missed opportunity, with some decent moments. It's not a total disaster, and it has some clever moments, but sadly it's a bit of a tonal mess.

53,aharmas,"So Intense and Creepy, You Can't Take Your Eyes Off the Screen",10,6 June 2010,"Good movies sometimes are memorable. Great movies crawl inside your skin and make you part of the experience. Romantic movies make you cry and swoon, comedies give you a good time, but scary, intelligent films push the boundaries of your resistance and beliefs. Many times classics are made this way, and the last time I felt so passionate about a Sci-Fi film, Sigourney (Ripley) was challenging a certain predator to the ultimate duel. Imagine a creature scarier and more seductive than that, one who can potentially outsmart you because it is very similar to you...Exploring the creation and manipulation of life and playing God has always been fascinating. It's been tackled before, and usually the consequences are, to put it mildly, problematic. In this film, maybe because of recent scientific and technological advances, the premise is not so far fetched anymore, as two young, revolutionary scientists embark on a journey they might not be ready to tackle. Before they can evaluate what they have created, a hybrid being of their own creation has become a dominant force in their lives, and this is just the beginning of their problems.Soon, the beautiful and intimidating Dren shows that she is unlikely anything else we have ever seen, and as she evolves from baby through adulthood, we discover interacting with her can be potentially lethal. With the help of a very self-assured direction, the film has a tight grip on its audience, and we are always experiencing a surge of adrenaline as we know something bad lurks around our two protagonists, and we never know when it will strike, or how destructive the strike will be. Physically Dren is very different, incapable of human speech and with a very scary appendage. It's only her seductive beauty that lowers our defenses, and eventually we discover what is the source of her grip on our protagonist, and the implications are extremely controversial and unethical.Beyond the scientific and ethical issues brought up in the film is an action film unlike anything we have seen before, one that explores the mental and physical connections between the creator and the creature, and this one successful connects the audience to the source material, as we experience wonder, fear, revulsion, disgust, and a series of emotions rarely seen in films anymore. It helps that actors of the caliber of Brody and Pauley play their parts adroitly. They are believable as both scientists and risky mavericks.Beautifully shot, expertly written, flawlessly acted, and with perfect direction, ""Splice"" is a welcome new entry in a genre that has grown tired over the last decade. This film feels as if De Palma and Cronenberg are working together at their peaks, infusing a story with atmospheric tension, darkness, and intelligence, and to top it all plenty of style. Here is a film that shows the potential implications of a field that is in its infancy, but that maybe should be stay where it is... after all, why should people mess with something they can't or might not ever understand or control?",Splice
54,peterp-450-298716,They could have made so much more of it !,4,22 February 2014,"Why the f*ck did you make her in the first place? Huh? For the betterment of mankind? You never wanted a normal child because you were afraid of losing control.The premise of this film seemed ideal to make a sort of variant on the ""Frankenstein""-theme. The creation could well be a success, but the consequences and the non-calculated risks would again provide abuses and lead to probably a not so happy end. Eventually this movie began in a highly intriguing way with the manipulating of DNA. This allowed the two top scientists, Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast, to develop a new organism from which they could fabricate certain products that could cause a revolution in the fight against all kinds of deadly diseases and disorders.Obviously there were some ethical issues involved and after a while it was succinctly made clear that the entire project was put in the freezer. Well ! That's how I understood it anyway and afterwards I was surprised to see that there was a press conference with an introduction of the two new lifeforms in a room full of press people and fellow scientists. The lifeforms looked like misshapen hunks of meat and resembled giant wriggling meat maggots. There was no comparison with the existing species from which they had taken the DNA. One of these two hunks of meat also underwent a gender change and thus a painful fight was shown where blood and slime residue got thrown all over the front row. Actually that was the only gore part of the complete movie.The two top scientists don't want to stop with the project and they begin their own private experiment by using human DNA. And that's where the movie takes an incomprehensible and terribly wrong turn. The creature is born in an artificial womb where Elsa gets attacked as she tries to save the unborn and then she goes into a sort of epileptic condition. Why that was and what actually happened is unexplained. The creature looks pretty realistic in its early stages and more than once it made ​​me think back of other SF movies with cheeky abnormal creatures in labs. Comparing ""Alien"" with this movie however is a bit too far. But eventually it grows out to be a jumping mouse with a lizard tail and a sharp sting. It's also equipped with two pairs of lungs to survive in open air as well as under water.What started to nerve me is the behavior of Elsa as a strict educator along one side and a distressed woman with an unfulfilled wish to be a mother on the other side. It came so far that she performed an amputation of the tail because she felt threatened. Also there was the jealousy as the creature began to show affection for Clive. Not so difficult since Elsa used DNA of her own.We then underwent successively the following story lines: Clive has sex with the creature, the creature dies and is buried, a male variant appears suddenly and rapes Elsa, murders Clive and Elsa finally crushes it with a huge rock. As a final result, Elsa is pregnant with a new specimen and gets a fortune so scientists can study her body. Well well well, we really didn't see that one coming.Conclusion: An excellent start, an annoying and tedious middle and a totally weird and insane ending. Dren (the inverse of NERD) was in the early stages nicely formed by the CGI and in the final stage I really could appreciate the unfolding of her wings. Eventually she mostly had a carnival cartoon-like appearance with a rubber sheath over her head. But the erotic development was a bridge too far for me and gave rise to meaningless and superfluous scenes. This movie isn't exactly a high flyer. And they could have made so much more of it !

55,Enchorde,Interesting movie that never reaches it's potential,5,17 May 2011,"Two young but brilliant scientists, Elsa and Clive, work at an upcoming but unstable medical company with advanced DNA-research. Their greatest achievement is Fred and Ginger, two genetically engineered creatures, spliced from a various mix of animal DNA, that can produce a valuable protein. But Elsa and Clive don't want to stop there, they want to include human DNA in the mix, but the company is reluctant. They want to cash in on Fred and Ginger instead. So they go forth in secret, creating Dren. Dren, however, grows extremely quick and shows a remarkable intelligence. Soon she is hard to control and the situation around Elsa and Clive is deteriorating quickly.Any movie with both Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody is worth checking out. Both are veteran actors with a good taste in choosing movies to work in. And Splice is a good story with some interesting points brought to the surface. It is a intelligent script, but interestingly enough the creature Dren is not the focus, just the catalyst, in the complex relationship between Elsa and Clive. That makes Polley and Brody as perfect choices as the leads.Unfortunately the story fizzles out just a bit. It is dependent on too many mistakes or bad decisions from Elsa and Clive. With them being brilliant scientists it takes a bit of the credibility from the story, not to mention a big chunk of the suspense. Therefore the movie doesn't live up to its potential.5/10",Splice
56,Jonny_Numb,The Horrors of Parenting,7,7 June 2010,"James Whale's 1931 adaptation of Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" was one of the earliest films to chronicle man's quest (via science and nature, and in notably strict defiance of God) to literally create life by transgressing human reproduction; granted, the result was the hideous, hulking visage of Boris Karloff, but one couldn't help but be in awe of the sheer gumption of Victor Frankenstein and his accomplices. Roman Polanski evolved this idea (via adaptation of Ira Levin's novel) in ""Rosemary's Baby,"" which took the notion of creating something truly awful (the son of Satan) and using it as a metaphor for a woman's self-destruction and paranoia during pregnancy. Larry Cohen's ""It's Alive"" took contemporary paranoias of a carcinogen-engulfed atmosphere and nuclear proliferation and applied it to his own murderous, bloodthirsty infant. And rounding out this prolific bunch is David Lynch's ""Eraserhead,"" a hauntingly surreal horror film that not only presents parenthood with fearful uncertainty, but treats acts of sexuality and procreation with a metaphorically clinical (but never explicit) disgust.Vincenzo Natali's ""Splice"" falls somewhere within this noteworthy pantheon of mad science, moral/ethical conundrums, and icky special effects. Many have already drawn comparisons (both positive and negative) to the early, mutation-informed works of Canadian auteur David Cronenberg, but Natali is just as interested in exploring the questions under the surface as he is showing an astutely creative visual eye. For a while, the film plays like something closer to an art-house feature (especially given the presence of character actors like Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley) with intriguing ideas and a solid FX budget. There are missteps along the way, but for the most part, this is a solid little sleeper.Clive (Brody) and Elsa (Polley) are young scientists who have made a breakthrough in artificial life: two blob-like creatures (one male, one female) with the ability to manufacture an artificial protein for the purpose of nourishing livestock. In typical, business-first fashion, their corporate overlords marvel at the notion of mass-manufacturing it, and promptly reject Elsa's proposition of human experimentation (to cure genetic disorders). Driven by curiosity, the duo wind up creating Dren (Delphine Chaneac), a creature whose accelerated life cycle prompts the creepily maternal Elsa to keep her as part of a more personal ""experiment."" ""Splice"" contains subtle, well-played allusions to bad childhoods, long-term psychoses, and the shifting roles of parents in the eyes of children (Clive starts off as vehemently oppositional; later, he becomes a reluctant accomplice who ultimately develops a bizarre affection for the creation), not to mention the tension between parents amid the child-rearing process; watching this trio interact supplies most of the film's compelling, hypnotic moments. This deliberate pace and focus on character may prove off-putting to horror fans sold on the ADHD weirdness of the trailer, but those with open minds will find much to gorge themselves on.Despite all the admirably creative spins on familiar concepts, Natali (or perhaps the producers, action aficionado Joel Silver being one) run out of fresh material by the climax, which takes chase clichés and overdone monster effects down a road that exists solely to patch up some character arcs and drum up excitement in a blandly conventional way. That being said, the first 3/4 of ""Splice"" is such a surprisingly effective slow burn of suspense and dread (culled from universal hopes and fears), played out by actors who know the fine line between camp and creep, that its later machinations are pretty easy to forgive.6.5 out of 10",Splice
57,valleyjohn,One of the worst films i have seen in a long time,1,17 November 2010,"I have seen some bad films over the years but few as bad as Splice. This is an awful piece of crap that epitomises everything about lazy film making. The actors are miscast , Adrain Brody and the dreadful Sarah Polley are as much Genetic Engineers as i am a Ballet Dancer. Sarah Polley reminds me of Julianne Moore , who annoys me every time i watch her. The special affect couldn't be less ""special"" if it tried. The story is shamefully bad. The plot is full of holes the dialogue is ridiculous . The 1 hour 44 minutes felt like a lifetime and i could wait for this piece of trash to finish. Director Vincenzo Natali should be ashamed of this movie. If your thinking of giving this a go take my advice - Don't.",Splice
58,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Splice (2009),8,29 December 2011,"Wonderful Sci-Fi/Horror that does what the genre was always supposed to do. It comments on the ethics of science, whilst also dealing with societies fears. Not only is a human-hybrid created for the ""greater good"", but this human hybrid becomes a child to it's two creators. It becomes more than just an experiment, and eventually we are in the center of a very dysfunctional family. The build-up is slow, and it is fairly obvious as to where it's headed, but the dynamics between Brody and Polley are captivating to watch unfold and Chaneac does a lot with no dialogue, turning from a frightened little girl into a fully fledged femme fatale (and beyond). More could have been done, but what is does do is done pretty much perfectly.",Splice
59,Seraphion,Unclear character development with a predictable plot,5,13 October 2014,"The story offers quite a promising premise, despite it's not the first time. Unfortunately the plot becomes a little bit predictable once Elsa decides against Clive in killing the baby Dren. It goes on normally for an already predicted plot but then the plot gives away big time when Fred and Ginger show their claws and start fighting. The predictability is also done by the trailer that was giving out too much detail. That makes the only decently nice twist in the movie to be when Dren suddenly grows wings. The character developments are very imbalanced and quite unclear. Clive's character doesn't really get developed right. How can he turn from one that wanted to kill the experiment to someone that would make out with it? Also the number of characters is too small for this kind of movie to work. It should at least have two more characters to give the story more color. The acting is a standard job in overall. Adrien Brody gets quite confused in expressions when acting out the various emotions in different scenes. Sarah Polley did quite okay on the expressions, but her dialog has emotions missing here and there.",Splice
60,Kamurai25,"Look, there is no story without the poor decisions of its characters",7,6 July 2020,"Really good watch, will likely watch again, and can recommend.Warning: there is a sexual assault, so if that triggers you, then please don't watch.Adrien Brody (The Village), Sarah Polley (Dawn of the Dead), and Delphine Chanéac (mostly french films) carry this story well: in the realm of bio-creation (somewhat connected to cloning), are trying to create a life form to farm a chemical compound to ""save the world"".Now, I like that it shows how boring science can be without making the movie itself boring: those people work hard, doing monotonous things for all of us, and I'm glad they get their due here. We do spend more in the crazy moments, and while I'd like to see a fake live feed of the growth of the creature, no one has time for that.They do a rather great job of following an accelerated growth rate and tracking how our couple are getting on professionally and personally, the prior being the driving force of the story, and the latter adding the flavor to the story.Raising / growing a pet, a chicken for instance, is hard enough, let along a human child that can understand you (even if it can't communicate), and if you don't know that chicken's breed, or at least it's predetermined instincts: how aggressive it is, what it eats, then you're in for a challenge that can hurt someone, the subject included.Now adding in that you don't know what this thing is, only that it is part human, smart, and potentially lethal. This sounds way too close to having a raptor around to me, except the raptor doesn't have the potential to wanna sex me....at least not outside of fan fiction.The creature itself is amazingly well done, this was done in 2009, and I have trouble knowing what is practical and what is CG and what is a mix because I can point out at least one of each, but they did such a good job on the muscle movements, details on its digits, and really playing with your (and the characters') perception of its personhood.There are a lot of ways to sell you on this, but I think the most effective is do you want to see a messed up, sci-fi, mad scientist's creation, creature feature? Then give this a go.",Splice
61,lewiskendell,An experiment with mixed results.,5,18 October 2010,"""We crossed a line and things got confused.""Splice is quite the interesting sci-fi/horror movie. There have been many movies about science gone too far, and while this one might initially tread somewhat familiar ground, it eventually goes its own direction - to mixed results. Two scientists specializing in splicing animal genes together to make new lifeforms, take an unwise and hasty step forward and introduce human genes into the mix. The result is Dren, an intelligent mix of animal and human that draws both paternal and other feelings from the two, despite their initial horror at what they had created. But dangerous changes in their other experiments combined with the violence that's inherent in Dren's human side, hint at the fact that something truly horrible might result from tampering with nature.The best parts of the movie, to me, were watching the young hybrid growing up through the recognizable stages of human childhood and adolescence, but mixed with the odd animal behaviors that make the unnatural creature so oddly frightening. When the movie inevitably takes (a very creeeeeeepy) turn for the worse, is when it started to lose me. Let's just say that the relationships between both scientists and Dren end up going way to far in different ways, and the tone of the movie subsequently changes. And not for the better, in my opinion.The reason why I described Splice as ""interesting"" instead of ""good"", was because of my conflicted feelings. It started off well, but the latter half undermined the solid start. Cheers to the filmmakers for doing something different, but different isn't always good.",Splice

63,oneguyrambling,Proof that not all experiments work...,5,27 December 2010,"Someone saw Species a few too many times and decided to make almost exactly the same movie, only from the scientist's point of view, and instead of a cast featuring TV rejects and Henstridge's chest-puppies they cast respected actors Sarah Polley and Adrian Brody.After some decidedly tacky credits we witness the ""birth"" of some form of baby - a baby that apparently sees very well and views things through a fish-eye lens - a baby apparently with a massive eye which pulses for some reason.When we see the baby it is in fact eyeless (at least according to my non fish-eyes) and looks like a giant tongue about the size of a loaf of bread, pink and fleshy with no arms or legs. So that first part made no sense at all – get used to it.The baby is not the first and was genetically engineered through the splicing of genes, it is a genetic and massive scientific breakthrough, as the creature's DNA makeup provides clues as to potential cures for various diseases.The lead scientists responsible for the breakthrough are Clive (Adrian Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley), who are also a couple. They realise that by splicing human DNA even greater results are possible, so they take their news to the bigwigs in Head Office; and instead of respect and congratulations they are told to shelve the research, curing diseases is bad for business if you are in the business of selling treatments for such.Now Clive and Else are not your average scientists, they are hip and funky and listen to music, they high five in convoluted ways and eat tic-tacs wa-hey indeed. They work for a company named N.E.R.D: Oh I just can't stop these chuckles from escaping! They decide to Rage against the Machine and continue the research on the sly, deciding to let the experiment run a while and agree to can it if it gets too intense.The new foetus/embryo/whatever gestates at a remarkable rate and seemingly within days is ready to hatch/be born/whatever from its cocoon/nest/womb/whatever, given that the ""whatevers"" could add up to almost anything there is some genuine anticipation as to what the thing will actually look like. (""I don't care, as long as he doesn't have Clive's nose!"") So when the ""baby"" finally arrives and looks just like a giant testicle, it's fair to say I was a little let down. Thankfully shortly after Elsa realises that the big nut was merely a pod that held the actual creature, that when seen looks like a weird plucked chicken – only with the face of a seal.It is evident that Elsa is now having feelings that are far more maternal, though unfortunately Clive gets very cold feet and decides that they must end this right now Not only do they keep it, they name the little f*cker! Dren, who as she ages becomes more and more human in appearance, Elsa becomes more and more attached to Dren as she learns and develops at an astonishing rate, Clive even takes more of an active interest after he sorta tries to drown her at one point – which for some reason Elsa doesn't bother thinking about too much, and it is only when Clive's brother and fellow scientist Kevin encounters Dren for himself that they must think of more permanent lodgings. ******************************************************* I think we can join the dots a little from here.As Dren evolves and grows before their very eyes it becomes evident that Clive and Elsa may not be able to control her, she has a tail with a poison-dealing tip, can basically jump over buildings and is able to breathe underwater, as well as being freakishly strong, but mentally she seems quite young, perhaps around a toddler's age. So Clive and Else treat her as such, scolding her when required and setting clear boundaries, only this toddler is capable of almost anything and can kill you with her tail They take Dren to Elsa's run-down farm (that must be) nearby, here Dren can have a little more freedom and room to move, only she moves up into the terrible two's stage and on occasion decides to ignore her ""parents"" and do whatever the hell she wants to do, this leads to the inevitable new parent dilemma of how exactly deal with a grumpy toddler with superhuman abilities and killing power! Clive and Elsa deal with the ever-growing Dren in extremely different ways, this leads to complications (to say the least) and consequences. Surprisingly there is a startling lack of consistency in the behaviour or Clive and Elsa, at times the ""good cop – bad cop"" routine goes askew, one moment X is unhappy and Y supportive, the next minute the roles are reversed. Confusing and clumsy.Also Dren's fave parent changes depending on the circumstances, this is easier to understand if you support the theory that she is equivalent to a toddler, they change their tune 53 times a day every day.The finale devolves into one similar to so many other B movies, almost like they felt ""well that's 85 minutes, let's wrap all this up quick"", and if the ending was supposed to be a twist it was the most obvious in history.All in all this was a more serious affair than Species, less laughs, more moral dilemmas and surprisingly less consistency in tone. There is nudity in both but clinically speaking as a male Species offers way more reward in that department.Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. All in all I must say watching Splice makes me wanna watch Species again",Splice
64,suite92,Illegal research brings a world of problems.,8,11 June 2014,"Clive and Elsa have good success as gene splicers, and have produced two low level creatures, Fred and Ginger. All seems good at the beginning of the film.Joan, the leader of the company supporting their research, is pleased with their results to date. However, she needs (in the business sense) their research to take a different trajectory that will yield profits almost immediately. This direction is a bit boring scientifically, but will help the corporation's bottom line.Clive and Elsa are not openly insubordinate, but decide to pursue their desired research, which is to create a higher order pair than Fred and Ginger. While discussing having children one night, the couple get an alarm message from their lab. They rush over to find that the their experiment has grown at a much faster rate than expected. The living mass is in danger of dying. While attempting to save it, Elsa gets bitten. The experiment is saved, but the pair see that they have to go into full secrecy mode.As the spliced together being grows, their project manager, Barlow, orders their lab re-purposed to be used for research for Joan's new directive. Clive and Elsa move the creature to a basement area that is little used. As time moves on, Barlow has this area re-purposed as well, and the creature is moved to the farm where Elsa grew up. By this time, the creature can walk upright, has learned to spell a bit, and has shown itself to be amphibious. Elsa names it 'Dren' since the creature had used scrabble tiles to call her a nerd.While the pair deal with Dren's growing up, Joan needs a demo for her investors. She trots out her A-team, Clive and Elsa, who hope to show the usual pleasant antics of Fred and Ginger. Clive's brother Gavin has been caring for Fred and Ginger while Clive and Elsa have been absorbed with Dren. Gavin learns of Dren when he was following his brother; she almost kills him. Gavin misses that Ginger had changed sex, female to male, before the demo, which is an absolute disaster.Joan has angry investors on her hands, while Barlow is enraged at lack of results. Meanwhile, Clive and Elsa are still knee-deep in dealing with the growing Dren, who is still female.The pair face dilemmas. Is Dren an experiment, or is she their child? Moving to the farm brings up all sorts of memories of mother-daughter interactions in Elsa; this creates issues with Dren. They have invested all sorts of time in Dren, but this is not the work requested. Barlow grows suspicious, and will eventually sniff things out. What they have done is revolutionary, but also illegal. Should they present it anyway?-----Scores-----Cinematography: 7/10 Mostly fine, but quite a few sections were just too dark to make anything out.Sound: 8/10 No problems.Acting: 9/10 I liked the performances of all the six primary actors.Screenplay: 9/10 There are quite a number of stupid decisions made by the protagonists.

It dons its hat to the ""is science going to far"" theme but then leaves it very much alone.The film has quite a narrow perspective, concentrating on a handful of characters in a couple of small locations. Although the film's concept leans on the genetic aspect it is predominately a character study.The CGI is a little scrappy in parts but the director is quick to substitute sound affects and more traditional methods when the CGI would have struggled.The characters are believable and engaging.

66,KnightsofNi11,Too easy... too unbelievable,4,22 July 2010,"Splice is a disturbing sci-fi horror film about genetic mutation and the ethics behind such a practice. It follows scientists Clive Nicoli (Adrien Brody) and Elsa Kast (Sarah Polley). They are lovers working together on creating new life out of genes from a mixture of animals. They start out with two gene mutations that are just sentient blobs that squirm around in tubs. But then human DNA is added to the mix... Dren is born. Elsa secretly creates this new creature and cares for it as it (who eventually becomes she) grows. After discovering the scientific breakthrough they have created, Clive and Elsa have to keep Dren a secret from the rest of the world until they know exactly what they're dealing with. From here spawns a jumble of issues that range of intriguing to downright silly.Splice's main issues stem from unconvincing characters. I'm a huge fan of Adrien Brody. Unfortunately, he is given nothing to work with here. The dialog is very poor and so much of it feels like nothing but filler. You should have a deeper emotional connection with the characters in a story that tries to put so much emphasis social morality. Splice is unsuccessful here. The kinds of topics Splice tries to bring awareness towards are prevalent and obvious, but they are the only substance in an otherwise bland storyline. I felt cheated out by an emotionally devoid story that relies too much on cheap emotional pinpoints and shock factors.Towards the end, Splice takes a turn for the worst and becomes disturbing, disgusting, and just plain weird. The most bizarre things happen towards the end and it was at this point that I couldn't take the movie seriously anymore. After seeing Splice I realized that the genetic mutation idea is becoming somewhat stale and overdone. Unless done right, genetic mutation is too easy of a topic to hone in on emotion with. Perhaps science will surprise us with another controversial breakthrough sometime down the road. Until then, this genre will most likely remain lackluster and repetitive. For this reason I think Splice will be quickly lost and forgotten amongst other films like it.",Splice

68,abisio,Just a masterpiece,10,2 June 2010,"SPLICE is, as of June 2010, just the best movie I saw this year; and considering the trend of commercial movies; it probably will still by December. You probably do not remember Vicenzo Natali. He made by 1997 a great horror movie called CUBE which has some USA distribution; and later another sci-fi thriller called CYPHER (very good movie but as far as I know when straight to DVD in USA). He made a couple more things but nothing like a blockbuster. Now he is back and in excellent form. SPLICE's trailers try to show an horror movie but it really must be considered a sci-fi one. There are some very tense moments and a few bloody ones but it is far from horror, unless you consider our own inner madness something terrifying (well, we really should). Without giving away too much, the story is about a couple of scientists Elsa and Clive working on genetics and DNA splicing for a private company. After been able to create new live forms out of playing with genetic code they want to introduce human DNA in the mix but the private company is more interested in recover the investment which will delay their investigation. Obviously; Elsa does not want to stop the experiment; and ( for personal reason we later discover) she creates a creature (she will later call Dren) mixing her DNA with other animals' species. Clive is against all this but follows her wishes afraid of how their careers will be ruined if somebody find out. What follows is the process of Elsa becoming Dren's mother and all the behavior changes in all three main characters and things get very very bad. None of the character are easy to play. Luckily there are three outstanding actors. Brody and Polley are excellent as always. They able to carry the most difficult roles and this movie is not exception; but the big surprise is Delphine Chanéac as Dren. She is able to show all emotions from innocence to sensuality to fear to hate with under a heavy make-up and special effects. The creature is something so realistic and present all over the movie, that the creators of ""Prince of Persia "" and ""Clash of the Titans"" should take note.

Dren's creature design is both far out and even somewhat believable if you want to stretch your sense of speculation.fear of science, the future, and the unknown have always been the essential components of cautionary sci-fi. and Vincenzo Natali as director and screen writer employs them in true classic form.with so much sci-fi out there that usually rates a disappointment, this film is a real gem. solidly directed, acted and conceived. and it gives the viewer some real science speculation to ponder, and not things like 'octosharks' or little green and blue aliens. the world of cloning and genetic engineering is already here. we just have to make up our minds what we want to do with it. this film presents some issues as to what the failings might be. practical and ethical.",Splice
70,Christian_Dimartino,Smart and horrifying.,9,25 November 2010,"Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley are Splice scientists in Splice, which I think is this year's Orphan. Orphan was a smart thriller. But Splice is smarter, creepier, weirder, and more intense. And delivers something that is needed in a film like this:Creepy.Brody and Polley are a married couple. They are splice scientists, which means that they combine DNA. They, in my opinion, are lunatics. They decide to combine human DNA with many other animals DNA. And the outcome: A bald, tailed, hooved female creature named DREN(backwards for nerd).They decide to raise DREN and keep her a secret. The film gets really creepy as DREN gets older. Brody's character becomes attracted to her(not because of who she is... it's a twist) and Polley's character, who loved her before, begins to despise her.The film is not like you'd expect. I wouldn't call it a horror film. It's only a horror film for about 10 minutes.Those 10 minutes are horrifying. Splice is very entertaining. It's more interesting than Orphan too.

71,DonFishies,"A twistedly depraved, yet highly enjoyable science fiction nightmare",8,17 June 2010,"Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley) are genetic scientists attempting to come up with a breakthrough protein that will help combat against deadly diseases. But the pharmaceutical company financing their work wants to push ahead, despite their insistence of needing more time to perfect their work. With the prospect of losing everything they have worked for, the couple secretly splices together a cocktail of animal DNA with human DNA, and wait to see what happens. Rather quickly, an extraordinary creature is born, and the pair must figure out what to do with it.It may be 2010, but Splice owes its entire existence to the pioneering works of David Cronenberg and David Lynch. Yes, there are elements of Frankenstein and the work of H.P. Lovecraft scattered throughout the film, but the body horror, the mutations, the sexual depravity, the creature itself – all of these elements are cut of the same cloth the two legendary directors gave birth to in the 1970s and 1980s. But it is almost too easy to narrow down the little homages, references, and ideas co-writer and director Vincenzo Natali has dropped into his other-worldly tale. The whole film has a pulse unlike anything I have seen from the genre in recent years (outside of the enigmatic Avatar), and its low budget grittiness helps the tones and ideas of the picture go a very long way.It is because of these elements that Splice rises out of the gluttony of modern horror and science fiction films. It has the old school charm, and it uses that to its advantage to create a rather unique film for its time. Natali, alongside co-writers Antoinette Terry Bryant and Doug Taylor, have crafted an uncompromising view of a potential nightmare of the future. Much like other great science fiction titles, Splice makes the audience think very hard about the morals being broken at any given time, the consequences of the characters' actions, and the very nightmare before them of whether a splicing experiment gone wrong like this one, could actually happen in reality.If there is anything wrong with the film, it is the final act. Up until that point, everything feels very calculated and wildly unpredictable (especially one scene that rather easily disgusted the entire audience I was sitting with, including myself). But the last chunk of the film and especially in the dying moments of the film, the plotting seems very ill-conceived. It feels as if the writers had squandered all of their good ideas for the first two-thirds of the movie, and then ran out of ideas as to what to do afterwards. There are some good ideas at play here, but they just lack the intensity, enthusiasm and uniqueness of what came before. Ironically, a lot of these last scenes are in the television spots that make Splice look like any other horror movie, while the rest of the film tries its hardest to distance itself from everything else.The various creatures that appear during the film, specifically the differing evolutions of the spliced together science project nicknamed Dren, are the true marvel of the film. Much like District 9, the filmmakers here have taken a significantly smaller sum of money than the average Hollywood blockbuster, and have created effects that appear all the more realistic and genuinely impressive. While some look a whole lot better than others (the early renditions of Dren suffer the most), all of these nightmarish beings look excellent and for all intents and purposes, a lot better than they ever should have looked. Great care and detail went into creating these effects, and even more went into some of the makeup used on Delphine Chanéac and Abigail Chu to make the look of Dren become increasingly more believable. The work here is truly spectacular, and compliments the script wonderfully.The unfortunate thing about having such small casts is that the lead actors end up doing the entirety of the heavy lifting. But this is not a problem for Polley or Brody, who appears to have found a new resonance within the Hollywood zeitgeist, years after proving himself worthy of the big time in his Oscar-winning turn in The Pianist. Both are more than qualified for keeping the film afloat, and bring a passion to the small roles. Neither is terribly well written, but both actors breathe depth into their characters and performances. They have just the right conviction to their roles. They never waver or alter their style, even when the film veers into disturbing territory or all out insanity. Their chemistry is also quite well developed, and despite the initial weirdness, they are very believable as a couple.The real marvel of the film however is undoubtedly Chanéac. She is simply magnificent in her role as Dren. She has to emote for the entire film (the creature does not really learn to talk), in various stages of dress, and she is more than up to the task. Her quick tonal changes reflect both the character's struggle for identity, and the immediacy and honesty of the portrayal. Much like Polley and Brody, Chanéac has a heightened conviction to the role that never falters. Her depiction of this monster makes it all the more human, and she makes genuine horror still look devastating.Despite having seen the film a few weeks back, I still cannot get over how well done Splice was. It was cheap and gritty, but it had a low budget effects polish that was stronger than some of the best Hollywood blockbusters. The film has a few problems, but it is still well done all around, and should more than please fans of the genre. I can only hope for more inspired films like this to come from Natali in the future.8/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",Splice

She is an addict. She is gonna die. I don't like her.She pushed for this and now when it goes bad she just yells at him to do something. I don't like her so much.We know what is gonna happen. They are going do stuff and she will see and want what she has.And they are contaminating the lab.If you are in the front row you might be splashed.Mom never learned that lesson.I'm waiting to find out mom was the human element.Mommy's not in charge anymore so now mommy wants to take action. I don't like her so much.This is the most morally corrupt couple there could ever be. They both need to die.He's become something sick! You set the bar a long time ago.I have less than zero sympathy for them.Again you assume she is dying when you have no f-n idea. These people are terrible.This was nominated for best sci-fi film of the year?!In my typical irrational fashion I am going to impose my impression of Elsa on any future characters I see her play.,Splice
73,Imdbidia,A big deception,4,22 April 2011,"Two young biologists, Clive (Brody) and his girlfriend Elsa (Polley) are leading a research project specialized in splicing and combining the DNA of different animals to create creatures with a pharmacological and medicinal scope. The problem starts when they decide to introduce human DNA in the experiment, and a new creature, Dren, is born.Vincenzo Natali always has great and original ideas regarding the near future and humans' relation and interaction with modern technical and scientific advances. He has shown in his low-budget films how an idea is worth more than the means to carry it out. Unfortunately Splice exemplifies this in reverse. This is Natali's biggest budget movie to the date, but also the most messed up of the lot.The best thing about the film is the concept. The convenience and ethics of genetic experimentation are questioned indirectly, from a familiar, personal and emotional point of view. Are we ready to deal with the nasty consequences of silly experimentation in our daily lives? Is experimentation justified per se? Is a Frankestein-sort-of-genetic monster guilty of its actions? The interesting questions are washed away by a poor and over-pretentious script that wants to be a psychological thriller, a horror movie, and a sci-fic movie at the same time. The script should have focused on building up the characters, so we understand why they act in a certain way. The script forgets to explain, and just hints, Elsa's troubled childhood, which would have served to understand better why Elsa acts in a a certain way, and why she is so ready to nurture a freak child. We do not know why Clive would do some of the foolish things he does, when at the beginning he seems to be a very sensible guy, either. Only the supporting characters seem to make sense and have internal logic.Instead, the script gets distracted by the thriller/horror approach, which is ready to fail from the beginning. The mood and tempo are not right for a thriller, even less for a horror film, and if you don't get that right, the rest does not make any sense. On the other hand, the predictability of the film makes the suspense ""unsuspenseful"". After the confrontation between Ginger and Fred the viewer knows what is coming; in fact, any scientist would have known immediately what was going to happen to Dren, so I considered a lack of respect towards scientist thinking that the two characters would not make the link and would act the way they do.Regarding the acting, Sarah Polley is always a natural in front of the camera, and she is fresh and warm as a scientist and as Dren's putative mother Elsa. On the contrary, I did not believe for a second Adrian Brody in his role of scientist and forced parent, probably because he did not believe it either. Delphine Chaneac's physique has a mix of beauty, vulnerability, awkwardness and harshness that worked perfectly to portray the freak nature of mute Dren. Finally, we find again one of Natali's staple actor, his friend David Hewlett, who convincingly plays a very serious the sensible lab director William Barlow. The rest of the cast are correct in their respective roles.The movie has been a big deception to me, perhaps because I have always loved Natali's movies and ideas. The worst thing is that the movie is pretentious, and preposterous at times, so one does not feel sorry rating it low.",Splice
74,the-movie-guy,An experiment in movie making that has gone horribly wrong,2,4 June 2010,"(Synopsis) Clive Nicoli (Adrien Brody) and Elsa Kast (Sarah Polley) are two young scientists who have been given the job of running a genetic laboratory at a large corporation to develop a protein using animal gene splicing from several different species. To speed up the process, they secretly take a chance and add human DNA to the experiment. What they get is a new organism which Clive wants to destroy, but Elsa convinces him to let it live a little longer. As the creature grows bigger, you begin to see a new animal species. The creature looks like a human female, but it has many features of several animals. The creature has wings, a stinger, can breathe under water, and can communicate with Elsa. They begin to bond with the creature and name her Dren (Delphine Chaneac). Their little experiment has gotten out of hand, and it could be the end to their careers if it got out that they created an animal/human hybrid. They move Dren to Elsa's farm in the country where Dren continues to transform into something stronger. Clive and Elsa finally learn the reason why they shouldn't play with Mother Nature.(My Comment) ""Splice"" is a monster movie that tries to package itself under the sci-fi/genetic engineering tale. The movie began with a serious story line that turned into an unbelievable and ridiculous plot. Instead of horror film, we got a comedy. There are several serious scenes in the movie where we were just laughing at it. The story's premise is on target with what science is doing today with DNA, but it was wasted on this movie. The actors' performance was OK, but that was about all. The CGI of Dren was pretty good, but it was also a waste. I thought about getting up and leaving the movie several times, but I didn't because it had to get better, but I was wrong. My advice is to skip this movie and save your money and time. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 1:44, Rated R) (2/10)",Splice

77,estreet-eva,Frankenstein let's his freak flag fly.,4,6 December 2011,"Perhaps because Mary Shelley matured for only 18 years prior to writing the classic ""Frankenstein"", she left a great number of open questions about the premise. ""Splice"" (always be skeptical of films with one word verbs as titles) answers the most pressing of these: what are the consequences of playing god by creating monster but then having sex with it? To this weird premise add the always off-center Adrien Brody (what's with the Stella Artois Superbowl ad?) and relative unknown Sarah Polley who plays the genuinely creepy Elsa. Elsa's unconventional upbringing well-explains why she would be down to create and raise the genetic mutant (think of the women in ""Aeon Flux"" with sharp tails) called Dren. Dren (did any parents go with that for the newborn's moniker - it's actually a good girl's name)eventually grows up and into precisely the monster you fully expect. The movie captures a bit of that broad scale discomfort that the much better David Cronenberg's ""Dead Ringers"" exemplifies where all of the characters are creepy to one degree or another and the weirdness descends into a truly horrific ending. Director Vincenzo Natali can claim no Cronenberg-level skill although he matches well both in tone and talent against M. Night Shyamalan. Another way of saying that previous sentence is that the film cannot be said to be entertaining in the conventional sense but the slow unwinding does have the occasional thrill. In short, the blatant sequel setup offered in the final scene was wildly optimistic of Natali and a gamble that will likely always remain snake eyes.",Splice
78,socrates99,Probably the creepiest movie I've ever seen,8,11 June 2010,"To get right to the point, for me this is either Sarah Polley's movie or the director's and I'm not quite sure which. The director, Vincenzo Natali, had a lot to do with the more admirable parts of this movie. Unfortunately, he was also there for its misses while Ms Polley is virtually flawless.From the very start you're put on edge as even the credits are unnecessarily creepy. But then there's a scene straight out of Aliens which misses a bit. Luckily the film recovers nicely and hits several memorable moments as it progresses.But Sarah is the focus of this film and she is utterly believable. I know this woman and I'll bet a huge percentage of the audience will recognize her too. Brody is mostly just likable and well cast, while Sarah seems to be where we should look whenever she's on camera.This movie's definitely creepy but by its end most of its most disturbing scenes will have been washed away, a nice trick. The most impressive thing for me was the CGI and the very real insight into the ambiance of a research lab.",Splice
79,samkan,Fun Though Clueless,6,30 November 2010,"SPLICE doesn't appear to take itself too seriously and that's a good thing for a horror flick. The science fiction aspect is unpretentious; i.e., it is clear that the ""science"" underlying the creation of Dren has no intention of being convincing. In short, like Mary Shelley, Frankenstein is created primarily to evidence the ensuing complications.This is where the film gets into trouble. Too late into SPLICE do we learn that Polley's background is a dominant force. While the first half of the film pulls us in on the themes of morality and contemporary science, the second half turns out to be a monster movie. Either are fun but the abrupt turn is confusing.Brody and Pollack are just two fine actors and they do tremendous jobs. The dialog is just right: Not too much fluff or emoting.

I felt there wasn't enough character development and so I found it very hard to sympathise with either of the leads. It is alluded to that one of them may have had psychological problems as a child but this is just skated over and when it later becomes a major plot point it has lost all of the impact it might have had. I thought the performances were all right with nobody really standing out. I do have to give a little praise to Delphine Chanéac though for her portrayal of Dren though; it was more of a mime because there's no dialogue, but I thought she did it well. Over all, a disappointing film that promised much but failed to deliver by the end.

84,Bloodwank,Sadly misfiring but relatively interesting science fiction thriller affair,5,12 June 2011,"I try not to carp at science fiction films that get science or scientists horribly wrong, so long as they entertain. Ditto films with dodgy writing, as long as the writing is competent enough to move things along I try not to complain Splice entertains up to a point and it moves along OK, but I'm still going break my own rule. The one time where I absolutely do carp about flawed writing and research is when a film demands to be taken seriously, when something goes beyond popcorn and into graver realms is the moment where I demand the basic set up to not offend my intelligence. Sadly Splice has a set up more along the lines of a Sci Fi Channel original production, and this isn't its only problem. But first, the set up. Clive and Elsa (nice reference) are two hot shot scientists who succeed in creating life from gene splicing shenanigans, funded by multi-national corporate types in a seriously expensive and well kitted out lab. Then they make a part human, the exact opposite of what their paymasters asked them to do, and sneak it out the lab to Elsa's rural home when things start to get more serious. The film in part deals with the clash between cutting edge science and human frailty so it isn't so hard in the context of the film as a whole to deal with scientists acting completely contrary to reason, but in the context of a privately funded endeavour of which they aren't the decision makers or money holders the notion that they would have been able to get away with any of it is ridiculous. It casts a pall on the film but as things go on it turns out Clive and Elsa aren't really being held to any standards of professionalism and barring another piece of science related idiocy later on that actually doesn't irritate too much (what with what has gone before) the film then gets into its main thrust, a parenthood tale with some dark and twisted currents relating to the cyclical nature of abuse. Here for a goodly length of time Splice actually works pretty well. The writing is thin, paying only lip service to any themes but things are propelled by great effects work and nice sort of physical chemistry between the players. It isn't that they get on, but the tension works rather nicely Adrian Brody as the weak and flawed but relatively decent Clive playing well off Sarah Polley as the damaged and descending Elsa and both working very well with Delpine Charneac and her compelling, thrillingly physical turn as Dren, unearthly yet oddly attractive. Its this midsection that makes the overall flaws with the film so irritating, because here we see just how good the film could have been with some writing touch ups. Of course, good things have to end, and the finale is generic, inept and inane monster action stuff, a couple of nicely twisted twists with haphazard execution and a forgettable ending. Weak. Nothing here is truly bad, but its an irritating waste of subject matter that could have made for some of the best science fiction since Cronenberg.

86,benoit-3,An ugly little film about ugly little people,3,12 October 2010,"""Splice"" is an unattractive sci-fi film about two unattractive and nerdy young scientists who are also wannabe hipsters. One is played by Adrian Brody and the other by Sarah Polley. Brody's character functions in three modes: (1) as a continual whiner worrying about the deep mess that his partner is getting him into, (2) as an irresponsible idiot willing to go along with anything his partner gets him into and (3) as a person who says ""f***"" a lot. Ms. Polley's character is just as complex and works in the three following modes: (1) as a producer of mucous, (2) as a person who is demanding, difficult, bitchy and premenstrual and (3) as a person who says ""f***"" a lot. This use of the ""F"" word is actually one of the saving graces of the film as it does much to shorten some truly unbearable dialogue.The two nerds are geneticists who have developed an hybrid species and want to push the experiment further, unbeknown to their employer, by mating the new breed with human DNA. The monstrous result is a cross between a chicken, a squirrel and Britney Spears. The irresponsible couple decides to make matters worse by allowing the abomination to grow and develop, the Polley character seeing it as a kind of safer and more controllable motherhood than her own dysfunctional family past, and the imbecilic Brody character just being along for the ride.As the cage cleaners at the zoo are found of saying, ""monkey s*** will fly"".The two anorexic main characters are so repulsive in their own right and on every level that I found their sexual coupling even more difficult to watch than the much more unnatural matings that follow. The film takes the viewer irretrievably down the slippery slope of unresolved and unexamined moral and ethical dilemmas right into the realm of the frankly - and splashily - disgusting. It overstays its welcome by a good half hour before everything is made permanently wrong all over again.Still, it's a little demoralizing to note that the apparent conclusion of the film seems to be that all the two protagnists really needed to settle their myriad problems and contradictions was a good f***.I only found two redeeming qualities in this puke-fest. First, the director and PD were not total slaves to the inescapable cliché that is the obligatory blue-green colour scheme of 90 % of the American movies and 99 % of the sci-fi films produced during the last 10 years. Some colour does poke through occasionally, although not enough to make the experience less depressing for the viewer or to counter the effect of the mortuary music that bathes the whole. Second, there is an imaginative use of the back speakers at exactly the 1:00:30 point of the film, that made me jump right out of my skin. It's sort of nice to know that at least the sound man stayed awake during part of the making of this horror.",Splice
87,Quebec_Dragon,Give Splice a chance : it's more evolved/involving than initially appears,8,26 June 2010,"Splice is a solid, somewhat intellectual yet visceral science-fiction tale about a new type of hybrid life being created by 2 genius scientists who are also a couple. I went to see this after other big-budget summer blockbuster movies were all sold out. The conventional looking preview I had seen had convinced me to skip it at least until DVD. It turns out I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality on display here. The subject matter was fascinating and the story was very well told. This movie succeeds in threading a fine line, alternating between moments of tension and amusement, mostly related to the creature. The viewer is like the scientists, not quite sure what to make of it... it sometimes appears dangerous, sometimes sympathetic, often peculiar. I personally loved the ambiguity of the creature. It's not easily pegged as good or evil, human or animal. The way it grows is quite interesting and for me it was quite original yet credible in looks, behavior and evolution, except perhaps for one thing on a roof at some point. However, that part was wondrous and considering it's an amalgam of species, not so far-fetched on second thought. The actress playing the creature in the second half was amazing, particularly in her movements and otherworldliness. The main actors, playing the scientist couple, were very good and I really enjoyed their respective character developments, something too rarely seen these days. My two nitpicks of Splice would be that the security measures at their workplace seemed way too lax and that the last stage of the fascinating creature seemed anti-climatic, provoking a certain detachment between it and the viewer. It was darn clever though as well as the conclusion. Splice is more intimate than visually spectacular often taking place in interior spaces, often involving only 2 or 3 characters. So in Splice, we have an anomaly for the summer movie season : a smart, intellectually stimulating yet emotionally powerful, sci-fi suspense with strong ethical overtones. It's well worth catching and discussing.Rating : 8 out of 10 (remarkable)",Splice

Evidence comes to light from another of the stupid scientists idiotic experiments that things might not all be as they seem but these two seem to ignore the evidence that is screaming out at them. They also ignore several utterly obvious traits of their little science fair project which would have led to them not ending up in the state they did at the end of the movie. The moral of this story is that if science is conducted in facilities such as this which are as secure as my local branch of ASDA and by so called scientists who are as idiotic as this duo then frankly we are in deep poop! At one stage these two clowns wander out of a secure bio-tech facility with a huge box with a chirping thing in it and nobody at all even asks them 'what have you got in the box doctors'. Awful film nicked from movies like The Fly and Species badly acted and badly written. Special effects were decent and the opening sequence was cool but the rest was pretty dire.

Throughout the film the focus is on the creature aptly named Dren and how it progresses. Greg Nicotero (TWD) had his hands in the design of the creature which is actually very well done.The film itself is carried by the story of how to have composite DNA interjected with other hybrids to create proteins or other chemical compounds to ward of or fight disease.

I dismissed going to the movies for this one because I thought it would be another CGI heavy action survival flick. However, I decided to rent it recently because I heard some good things about it from friends and read some good reviews and so I gave it a shot thinking a film with Adrian Brody in it is never really a bad film. And I was right.Splice started off terrible. At first, it seemed like some made for TV movie, very few cast members, short scenes, heavy metal music, and choppy directing. But that was just the first quarter of the film. It picked up after Dren was born and the main characters developed some interesting conflicts. It is not a survival horror action film at all. It's more of a character drama with that make you question what is ethical and what is not. Science could be perverted real easily, and the script was good enough to make you feel bad that science could get that way.The acting was great, especially by Brody. He didn't have a good screenplay to work with and nevertheless made the most out of his role. He really puts emotion into his work and takes pride in every role and that is why he's one of my favorites. Sara Polley was decent, although not convincing as a scientist I think. I really thought the make-up in this film is as good as it can ever get. I was mesmerized at times, the monster looked so real. I did think some of the other mutants in the film was animated poorly though, but not Dren. She was imposing! All in all, a film that has an old school Sci Fi flair to it and I was surprised. It felt like a mini Island of Dr. Moreau with similar morals. I do think the end fell a bit short, and it's probably because the ending was predictable. But definitely worth a watch.",Splice

94,RockPortReview,Bodily Horror reminiscent of David Cronenberg,6,16 June 2013,"Canadian director Vincenzo Natali gave us the 1997 low budget horror/thriller ""Cube"" a Rockport Review favorite. Years later and a few straight to video projects, his 2009 film ""Splice"" actually made it to theaters even it was for a short time. ""Splice"" is a sci-fi thriller in the vein of David Cronenberg's early work.Clive and Elsa, played by Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody, are two hipster geneticists working on splicing the genes of several animal species together to make medicinal proteins for livestock with one day hoping to cure human diseases. Their two star creations are Fred and Ginger, big red slug looking creatures who turn out to be more than they bargained for. After a complete disaster at a medical conference showing off their creations, they are reprimanded by their big evil company and forced back to the drawing board. But Elsa now wants to push the boundaries and splice in some human genes into their concoctions. Although illegal and unethical they do it just to see what happens with the agreement that they will terminate the experiment before it gets out of hand. The sample grows at an exponential rate and Clive wants to stop it but Elsa, the motherly figure, hijacks the project and a cute little creature bursts out of the lab tank its was being incubated in.The baby creature scurries around the lab until Elsa captures it. It look like a kangaroo with tiny arms, a tail, and big head. Once caught Elsa cares for it while Clive only wants it gone. Its quite the ethical dilemma and shows the cracks in their relationship. She wants kids he doesn't. Elsa names the creature Dren, which is Nerd spelled backwards. Nerd is the name of some bio tech company that is written on Clive's shirt. Dren still grows at an amazing fast rate and starts to take on more and more human characteristics. Elsa puts a dress on her and treats her like her own secret little daughter. It starts to get harder and harder to hide Dren from the other at the lab so they move her out to Elsa old abandoned family farm. Dren is unable to speak but can understand when talked too, like a really smart dog.Things really start to get interesting an a little creepy when Dren grows up into a sort of teenager. Since Clive seems to be kind of a douchey guy to begin with he can't help but wonder what it would be like to hit that after initially wanting it dead. Elsa is pretty insecure about herself and starts to feel some serious jealousy over Clive and Dren's relationship. Fearing the worst Elsa straps Dren's naked body down to a table and cuts off the stinger at the end of her tail. Feeling hurt and betrayed Dren is driven even closer to Clive. Inevitably Clive and Dren do get down to business and Elsa of course walks in on them. Ouch! Needless to say she is a little freaked out. The third act goes a little off course, but it is still worth a watch.Sarah Polley is the best part of this movie along with Delphine Chaneac who plays the grown up Dren. Sarah's Elsa looks to have dealt with a lot in her past and has issues connecting with other people. She is pretty cold and closed off until she creates Dren who is more apart of her than Clive realizes. Natali filmed the movie with strong blues and grays giving it a very cold and clinical feel. The effects used are also well done with a unique and interesting opening title/credit sequence. Make a double feature of it and see ""Cube"" and ""Splice"".",Splice
95,Ric-7,Mad science,5,11 June 2010,"I didn't like the film very much, but I wasn't bored. Mainly because there were so many new ""twists"" that I didn't have time to get bored. There is no way I could recommend this film to anyone.About halfway through, the characters lose whatever partially-believable motivation they might have had to start, and events suddenly become ludicrous. When this twist occurred, I was first thinking that we would be dealing with at least one literally mad scientist, and that perhaps some dark humor was intended. But no, I was wrong, it was just bad writing.The chain of events in the plot is heavily dependent upon one development which is absolutely unbelievable: why would Clive have sex with the thing? At least partially his step-daughter (incest), definitely part animal (bestiality), and pedophilia may be involved because the thing is only a few days old. Clive didn't seem drunk or drugged. And could anyone possibly be that horny? For a moment, after the scene where an earlier mutant had changed sexes, I was wondering if maybe we would be getting into inadvertent homosexuality as well.I guess the ending was supposed to suggest Rosemary's Baby, but I think Rosemary actually wanted to have a child. Here, the thing was created based in part on Mom's unwillingness to have a child. So now Mom is ready to give birth to whatever? And the family tree for the child? Mom created a female thing using Mom's own DNA, and Dad presumably impregnates She-Thing, and then She-Thing (perhaps disappointed rather than impregnated by Dad's lovemaking) turns into He-Thing and kills Dad and then rapes and impregnates Mom.Way too absurd. And the leads are named Elsa and Clive. Maybe a nod to Elsa Lanchester and Colin Clive?",Splice
96,freaky_dave,"Started out good, ended up not so good",5,6 June 2010,"Splice was a movie that had a lot of promise. It seemed to be building towards something special, but got lost in an unnecessary plot thread that didn't quite work towards the end. THis specific plot started with a scene involving the creature and the character played by Adrian Brody, and it was a scene that didn't quite work because there wasn't enough of a build up towards something like that happening. Sure there were some scenes leading towards that, but in my opinion those scenes were not enough to take such a major step forward, not after he first showed disgust towards the creature at the earlier phases of its development. On top of that the movie goes even farther into absurdity at the conclusion, involving the character played by Sarah Polley and the creature again, taking much of the intelligence of the film out of the equation.In my opinion, the director was onto something in the beginning but then took the story into an unnecessary direction that might've still worked if there had been some real build up to those points which led to the conclusion. Sure there were some signs, but really not enough. Instead the movie ends in what can only be called a total WTF moment, and it doesn't work at all. Not a horrible movie, but only average and not recommended.",Splice

Both Chemists and Top-Level Scientists, who have their own company that is sub-leased to a larger corporation,Newstead Pharmaceuticals(that is a red flag), with disastrous consequences .Director Vincenzo Natali delivers a fresh look at the potential downside to Bio-genetic Engineering. The film neither promotes or condemns the science, but tells a tale of what one of the possibilities could be. And what a tale it is. Well crafted scenes that show the effects of playing God, and the Human reaction to people creating outside of the normal human spectrum. Adrein Brody and Sarah Polley both deliver solid performances of an uneasy and morphic alliance, that crosses man-woman/ science/moral and ethical relationships. WOW, just a terrific blend. Not since the remake of ""The Fly"" with Jeff Goldblum, has there been a fresh and deep introspective look at man and science, in an entertainment venue.This film takes cross-breeding to a new level. So beware, if you are squeamish about men and women procreating with sub-human life, then look elsewhere, but , if you dare to peak thru your fingers, then take a gander(pun intended) at this succinct and provocative film .

99,colinrgeorge,Untruth In Advertising,7,9 June 2010,"""Splice"" is a step in the right direction for horror.Every so often, I find myself pleasantly surprised by intentionally misadvertised entertainment, and writer/director Vincenzo Natali's genetic genre mash-up is the latest such example. From a marketing standpoint, its scare-tactics are clearly the easy sell, despite their comprising only a tiny percentage of its thematic intent. 'Hard sci-fi parenting metaphor' is, after all, a much tougher pitch.So expecting the tasteless creature feature from the trailer, ""Splice"" impressed me in its pursuit of a more complex emotional response than fear, and is successful in burrowing into your subconscious and picking at your psyche. It's a thinking man's B picture, which plays with the idea of morality on both a scientific and personal level. That it remains intellectually stimulating, even when the surface-area film dips into more traditionally hokey horror territory, is its greatest strength.What's so interesting about the story, in spite of what the trailer suggests, is that the creature artificially spawned by genetic engineers Clive and Elsa (Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley) is not an antagonist for the vast majority of the film. ""Splice"" isn't about a monster— It's about parenthood, and like with ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""Eraserhead,"" taking the associated fears and filtering them through a horror lens. Besides the tail and the pronounced facial cleft, test-tube baby Dren ('Nerd' backwards, heh) is essentially human, and a big part of ""Splice's"" inherent creepiness is that she's treated in turn as a subject and a child—Warmly received, but caged and abandoned for significant stretches of time. The realization of this character by French actress Delphine Chanéac, is another of the film's triumphs. Her general lack of dialogue sometimes forces the performance to rely a little too heavily on pantomime, but that we can both feel for and fear Dren simultaneously is a testament to the range of the actress.Perhaps it's because ""Splice"" nails the big performances and the big ideas, and because the gears turning behind the action are so consistently fluid, that it's all the more apparent when it stumbles over little things, like stilted motivation issues, and superfluous, grating secondary characters. Clive's brother (Brandon McGibbon) and boss (David Hewlett), for example, are flat placeholder roles that transparently progress the plot instead of enriching it. The triangular relationship between Clive, Elsa, and Dren, and its weird morphing emotional permutations, is what ""Splice"" is at its core. It is a film with very few characters, but every moment not spent on that central dynamic feels like time wasted.Still, that minor gripe is forgivable because ""Splice"" has two hugely important and rare qualities for modern horror—Original thought and fearless storytelling. The undercurrent of sexuality in the film, the internal dialogue on gender roles, is apparently one of the reasons no studio wanted to touch the script last year, but Natali's film is a cut above the rest precisely because it isn't afraid to make an audience uncomfortable. And it gets uncomfortable.""Splice"" gets a lot of credit from me in the abstract. The concrete film doesn't quite live up to the incredible promise of the ideas behind it, but the very presence of those ideas is reaffirming to a degree, and that ""Splice"" received a wide domestic release is more encouraging still. Granted, it went on to perform below expectations at the box office, but was positioned against more breezy summer fare like ""Shrek"" and ""Get Him to the Greek."" The other possibility, and this suggests more consumer confidence than an ad man may be inclined to grant, is that ""Splice's"" scare-tactics aren't the easy sell. Maybe, like me, potential moviegoers just saw a trailer for another crappy horror movie instead of the interesting, offbeat experiment it is.It's Warner Brother's loss, and the audience's.",Splice

However, the wife wants to try to make a new hybrid based on the human genome so that the protein is more compatible with humans and is produced in larger quantities, even though both the company she works for and her husband are opposed, she proceeds. The film goes far beyond the scientific part, but shows some bioethical messages, what is good and what is bad and of course all this is seen through the special relationship that the couple develops with the new hybrid. The film is clearly watched with interest, it has a bit of a dramatic element in it, it has some erotic element and romance, and it also has thriller elements towards the end mainly. It is worth a watch, but some things could still have been excluded and on the other hand the film could become more intense and better overall.",Splice
102,Siamois,Science goes wrong...,5,10 August 2010,"A classic story, Splice follows two young scientists experimenting with genetics, combining (splicing) the DNA of several animal species for experiments that might lead to medical breakthroughs. One day, the couple takes things to the next level when, against regulation, they use human DNA in the mix.With a mood resembling an old Cronenberg flick, Splice also borrows many elements seen in classic ""monster"" movies such as Frankenstein and even Species. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley, two solid actors, give good performances here but Vincenzo Natali's direction rarely flatters them. Likewise, the script has a relatively slow pace but character development is somewhat abrupt.The film has a rather creepy atmosphere and well-realized creatures and asks interesting questions. But the main problem is the lack of credibility of the science and unbelievable characters. At nearly every turn, our scientists are doing mistakes and their reactions are rarely logical. Likewise, their motivations are often sketchy at best. The result of their latest experiment, a creature called Dren, is interesting but often misused. Throughout the movie, several ethical questions are raised but it all feels very simplistic, like we have seen this a thousand times. The raw angle on sexuality feels very ""Cronenbergian"" but its introduction is awkward and when it is fully realized, lacks in impact because you just don't care enough about the characters. All in all, I expected Natali to direct a much more character-driven story and was slightly disappointed he couldn't do more with such fine actors. The movie remains entertaining but could have been much more than that.",Splice
103,mirwais-orbit,Complex background story for predictable twists,7,21 January 2011,"I've seen a lot movies these days, and Splice is one of them that I really don't have a solid opinion about.I'm a huge fan of Vincenzo Natali, his previous titles are amazing. Cube (1997) is one of the most cheap and interesting thrillers of all times; Cypher (2002) is an interesting sci-fi flick and Nothing (2003) has one of the most clever ideas as much as Cube, being intelligent, simple, funny and amazing.I was excited about Splice because since its announcement this movie would be his most expensive and after its release it was his first Top 10 box office to date with positive reviews around.But after watching the movie, the experience wasn't so great as I expected, not as much as Cube or Nothing. The story is a simple thing about 2 scientist that discover a way to isolate the best gens of different species randomly creating new ones when gens are spliced together, able to provide raw material for the cure of a variety of human diseases. But the consequences of that is unpredictable.So, they create a new specie which is named Dren, a female specie with human characteristics. First they treat and feed her like an ordinary puppet, later they treat her like their own child but not entirely because she is a scientific material. Dren is extremely intelligent and fragile. They try at all costs make her act like a human, but she's not as rational as a human and that's where lies the problem.The movie is well directed. Brody and Pooley provide great acting and the visual effects makes Dren believable - even being an irritating character sometimes. The focus of the movie is Dren - even when talking a lot about ethics - and Natali makes us feel exactly what she's feeling: the isolation, the tedium, the sexual discover and also the denial from being very different from the others which hurts her a lot. But the biggest problem of Splice is its predictability and you know exactly what will happen since the beginning. That makes Splice a little frustrating when you know Vincenzo's style from his other titles.Anyway, Splice is not supposed to be an ordinary sci-fi, but sometimes it falls to what ordinary sci-fis are: movies with a complex background story with predictable twists.",Splice
104,budmassey,A poorly articulated concoction,3,5 June 2010,"I was the only person at the early matinée. I'm thinking everyone else knew something I didn't.Hollywood loves this story; brilliant young scientists discover the impossible, while other people their age are still working on their dissertations, by ignoring the rules - for which, of course, they must pay a price. And they screw a lot.Sometimes this can make for classic transgressive fiction, like Jekyll and Hyde. Other times you get Splice, an apt description for this poorly articulated concoction. Good science fiction uses science as a metaphor to explore some essential truth. Splice is all science, if you can call it that, and no fiction, as in the literary kind. It's as shallow as a mud puddle and about as interesting.In the end, I simply wondered why this movie had to be made. So Adrien Brody could walk around in shirts he got from ThinkGeek.com?

Now for people that keep calling movies horror when they are not even bloody is wrong too. Horror is bloody, disgusting, and scary. Why people are trying to change what horror is, is beyond me. PG-13 remakes of horror movies are not horror. It is a horror movie turned into a thriller.Just because a movie is rated R, and has little jumpy parts in it does not make it a horror.

109,Craig_McPherson,Thought provoking horror at its best,9,6 June 2010,"In 1997 Canadian Director Vincenzo Natali's psychological thriller Cube became a minor hit for its innovative story about a group of prisoners who awaken in a cube shaped room with hatches on all sides. Depending on the choices, the hatches may lead to freedom, other cubes, or worse. If you haven't seen it, you should as it manages to be both enthralling and thought provoking. Jump ahead to 2010 and Natali's latest project, Splice, further establishes him as a supreme cinematic talent.Splice tells the story of two Toronto geneticists Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley) who have built their careers upon creating new genetic hybrids for their pharmaceutical employer, which seeks to patent new medicinal compounds from the organisms. Up to this point their greatest achievement has been two slug-like creatures that seem to be a pair of genetic Fort Knox's in terms of drug producing potential.Not satisfied with slugs, however, Elsa urges Clive join her in adding human DNA into the mix. The result is Dren (nerd spelled backwards), a curious creature that incorporates the features of human, animal, and fish. Call this an updating of Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, for Dren is very much the Modern Prometheus. Played by French actress Delphine Chanéac, Dren is the star of this film. Every bit the monster, she manages to be all at once engaging, sympathetic, unpredictable, and terrifying. Unlike conventional horror flicks in which the creature lurks in the darkness, picking off victims, only to be shown during the final reveal, Dren takes center stage from the moment she's artificially born. Her articulated deer-like legs, scorpion-ish tale, and bird/flying fish wings, while otherworldly, never manage to detract from her human side, which speaks volumes for Chanéac's performance.Thanks to Chanéac, Polley and Brody, Splice manages to establish a new standard for horror flicks. This heretofore independent Canadian flick (before Guillermo Del Toro signed on and lent his name as a Producer to help with the distribution) has managed to not only elevate the bar in terms of story telling for the horror genre, but shown that compelling and engaging stories can be told within the confines of a so-called ""monster movie"". Whereas I normally view sequels as mere attempts to cash in on the coat tails of the original, I, for one, look forward to the next installment, for Splice is very much an unfinished story in progress, and we only have Vincenzo Natali to thank for that.",Splice
110,Lucabrasisleeps,Confused Genres,4,30 November 2014,"I have wanted to see this movie for a long time since I checked out a few of Vincenzo Natali's movies sometime before. I finally saw it today. I am not satisfied at all. What I saw was a movie which was confused about which tone to take, what direction to move and so on. First, the whole pretty boy scientist thing totally turned me off. I didn't really take these two seriously as brilliant scientists. But there are many other problems with the movie. Honestly speaking, the movie could have been a brilliant thought provoking sci fi(like say, Moon) or an action/horror/sci fi movie (like say, Species) or a trashy 80s style movie(like say, Humanoids from the deep). If the filmmakers were able to decide the path properly, it could have been happened. Instead it is too stupid to be a thought provoking sci fi. It is too slow to be an effective action horror movie. It has very few scenes of nudity or violence to be a trashy 80s style movie. The movie IMO meanders aimlessly and it drags quite a bit for the most part. Most of the themes in the movie were dealt with in superior sci fi films. And they were dealt with in better ways in those movies. It has too many clichés and the mad scientist trope, playing with nature stuff has been done to death now. This movie has not broken new ground in any way. Hell, to some extent, it reminded me of inferior films such as Species(which at least had copious nudity to compensate).Then there is the entertainment factor. In a movie with so much trash potential, the sex scenes are a huge disappointment. Maybe Vincenzo natali doesn't have the trashy sensibility to make such a movie. And where are the big twists, the snappy screenplay? It doesn't seem to be made by the same filmmaker of Cube or Cypher. The ending left me yawning. Is that the supposed shock ending?Maybe we should bring back Roger corman or someone like that to make such movies. Altogether I give it a 4/10.",Splice
111,cashbacher,Human DNA does not mean human,10,22 November 2019,"The title of the movie is based on the actions of the two main characters, they are scientists and their specialty is splicing genetic material of different species to make hybrid and unusual creatures. They are a male-female couple and work for a major pharmaceutical organization. They are under great pressure to synthesis new compounds and when the movie opens, they have created slug-like creatures that move by amoebic-like shape alterations. It is hoped that their creations will synthesize the compounds they need.
Pleased with their success, the two scientists decide to go for the ultimate creation, an organism that contains human DNA in combination with that from other animals. They are successful and when their major creation is ""born,"" it is just another large amorphous blob creature like the others. It grows rapidly, developing into something that is human-like above the legs, albeit with a tail with a stinger at the end. The legs are lizard-like and very powerful. The two ""parents"" are at first disturbed by their creation and ponder killing it, but they quickly develop affections and treat it like their child.
There are many twists, unexpected and sometimes frightening events. Although the two creators treat the ""child"" as a human, it is not, even though it is intelligent and has human-like emotions. It has some of the predictability of humans but retains the unpredictability of creatures with intelligence that are not human. There is a climactic struggle near the end and the movie ends with a powerful visual cliffhanger.
This is a great movie; genetic splicing is already a powerful technique and will grow more so in the future. It is accurate in the sense that no one really knows what will happen if gene splicing is successfully done with multiple species, one of which is human. There will be the natural desire to treat the results as human when they will not be.",Splice

This movie starts of like a SciFi like the brotherhood movies like Hollow-man, Species types.Asusual it also goes like a team of people do something revolutionary to discover something which in turn becomes opposing force.With this one line the story starts with Clive and Elsa creating a new spliced DNA of human and animal combination were they create a creature of more human sort and name it as Dren. This girl like creature was isolated from outside since this is illegal as always in other movies like hollow-man.Sometimes the story fails to make us understand even the simple thought of science like in a scene why Dren turns up as a male and wants to mate Elsa and were a few scenes it was portrayed as a female and makes love to Clive.....? But overall this film had a good start as a Scifi and then goes down as a thriller and then further as a mystery and finally we become mystified about the story where it goes we get confused and then the story ends with the heroine being pregnant.I would say this was better than species but lower to Avatar.Special effects was convincing.6.5/10",Splice

When of their experiments seems to provide nothing, the program is shut down, yet they secretly continue their work, this time splicing human DNA.Of course at first it doesn't work, but eventually it does and a human animal creation is made, which they agree should grow to the first term to 'see if it can be done'. Not only does it grow to first term, but it has rapid aging, making it grow quickly and a infant is born. At first it resembles an odd type of bird and Clive (Adrien Brody) wants to kill it, but his partner Elsa (Sarah Polley) is reluctant. The creature begins to grow, becoming more human like, while still retaining animal features. It also grows which means they can no longer hide it from the rest of the team at the lab. The creature seems intelligent and at times human like, but retains animal characteristics making it volatile. The couple take the creature to Elsa's farm and things take a different course with the creature learning more and the Elsa and Clive becoming less in control.The film is less scary than I was expecting and is actually quite entertaining for the most part. The idea of genetic play is intriguing and terrifying, but the creature which they name Dren is almost endearing in some ways. The early scenes of it with less than human features are good and it's interesting to see it grow, even if it conveniently seems to have a whole manner of capabilities, wings, able to breathe under water etc. Once they reach the farm, the film takes almost a different route, with the idea of parenting coming into the story, as well as an odd sexual encounter between Dren and Clive. It's in this later part that the film became too standard for me.The special effects are wonderful in this with real actors and special effects blended to create a realistic creature. Making it more human, perhaps makes it less scary, but I think this works in the films favour, by creating less of a horror scenario and more of a thriller. While the outcome is predictable, it is a pretty entertaining romp.More of my review at iheartfilms.weebly.com",Splice

120,evan_harvey,"Interesting, a bit screwed up and controversial",8,25 September 2010,"Vincenzo Natali (of Cube and Ginger Snaps fame) has made an interesting film. It alternates between a sci-fi film and mimicking the idea of parenthood. The film goes into bizarre territory at the end. Although some comment that this is absurd, I found it to be engrossing (even though it's a bit messed up).Adrian Brody gives another fine performance. Sarah Polley does well too. The film is well-paced and interesting. Although the ending is controversial, I found it to be quite plausible and horrifying.Although apparently made for $26 million, it has a low-budget feel, and the SFX are very well done. I'd recommend it with a caveat that the ending might disgust some viewers. Easily an 8 out of 10 for originality, a tight script, SFX and bizarreness.",Splice

There are a few tries but nothing really steps over the line. In the end, Splice could have been a serious horror movie, but rather tries to be a modern fairy tale and therefor cuts back on violence and naturalism and ultimately gets stuck between the two genres, failing to compete with either of them. Not that it is screaming for PG rating, but it's just not gross enough. What a pity as all this was very promising and Ardrian Brody sure does a fine job.",Splice

Then came muddy cinematography, a nail-scraping soundtrack, and a couple of characters I didn't give a recombinant rat's ass about. The creature that evolved from their experiment, played by the wide-eyed, double-jointed Delphine Chanéac, gave the film a potential it never achieved. I heard members of the audience talking afterwards. Everyone, it seemed, felt let down by the end; surprised when the ending came as abruptly as it did. What started out as an imaginative excursion in science fiction, ended in what was intended as horror, but even that didn't succeed, as if anyone died, no one really cared. This could have been a great excursion into the imagination had it more talented writers, director or cinematographer (seriously, it looked like it has been shot in Super 8). A month ago, I would have suggested Ridley Scott, but, unfortunately, the last movie I paid for was Robin Hood, and several OMGs to that one. It seemed after watching all, that it was like it was written by a mystery writer, who just couldn't figure out whether it was the butler in the parlor with the candlestick or Prof. Plum with the lead pipe in the kitchen.

123,mergatroid-1,Rip off of Species...a little different,6,23 October 2010,"I thought from the previews this movie might be a little different, but I found it to be a lot like species, but with a little more emphasis on the moral reasoning behind using human DNA to create a new species to harvest for drugs, chemicals and whatever else they could take.All the way though the movie I was thinking the main male character was a wuss that should have done something to stop the nutzo female lead character. They go ahead and create this hybrid using human DNA, and then have to hide it in the woman's childhood home which turns out to be an old farm (how come movies like this always have a main character with an old family home in the country?).Watch species, put a woman in charge and a man trying to stop her from making a big mistake, and base half the movie on this and you get Splice. At least there were no car chases since they went to the farm so early and managed to keep everyone from finding out about their monstrosity.Usually in movies like this you get a mad scientist (bwahahahaha) shouting ""It's alive, ALIVE!"". That was the only refreshing thing about this movie, this time the obsessed nutzo mad scientist was a woman. I would have given it a couple of more points if it weren't such an obvious rip-off of Species.If you check out some of my other reviews you may notice I'm quite forgiving of science fiction movies because I like scifi so much, but in this case they could have called it a ""re-imagining"" of Species (which is just another way of saying they can't think up their own ideas and so they stole them from someone else). It's not quite so blatant since they make their monster by splicing genes, and in Species they make their monster by using instructions they get from an Alien transmission but they're close enough to call it a rip-off I think.Do yourself a favor and wait for it to be in the $3 bargain bin.

They decide to secretly continue their work, but this time splicing in human DNA. But, like every creations; it has its good as well as bad aspects. And things turn unexpectedly with grave consequences.Cast-wise, confused. Adrien Brody wasn't exactly suited for the role. He seems quite unnatural for the role of a geek scientist. Neither his unkempt hair nor nerd body were convincing enough. On the other hand, Sarah Polley was a bigger disappointment. She was just plain straight irritating. Her acting, expressions, dialogue delivery was all absurd. Overall, the casting was not credible enough.""Splice"" strength lies in its strange or rather unusual storyline, amazingly stupid or unique creature design and it's ending, where a lot happens to give an entirely new significance to the movie.

I have to admit, it's been a while since I've seen such a bad movie: terribly acted, ill-written and completely predictable. Towards the end, you realize it's the cinematographic equivalent of a painful, never-ending diarrhea: it hurts, it's lasting forever, and you want it to end, but it doesn't, and it's constantly giving you new plots and confusing you further more. The main idea is interesting enough, and casting Polley and Brody makes perfect sense, as they're terrific actors; that's pretty much everything enjoyable about the picture. The plot is as poorly-written as it can be, it's not funny and definitely not scary... I found it extraordinary that somebody actually made the movie.

Splice is a dark, gut-wrenching tale willing to swallow hole anyone that views it - you will slowly find yourself forced to watch the situations unfold as the idyllic aspirations of two scientists turns into a macabre of evolution.It really makes you question the real life study of cloning and genetical enhancements, at least the gruesome side of it. I found myself having a lot of ""WHAT THE F*CK WHY I AM I WATCHING THIS"" moments, as piece by piece the puzzle gets bigger and piece by piece the story moves deeper into the human psyche. By no means is this a spoiler: as the film progresses it gets ever more graphic in its detail, I found myself feeling slightly squeamish midway through some of the scenes (a feeling I haven't felt since i was 5). Let's talk acting: Adrien Brody established the leading role well, Sarah Polley gives you the motherly feminism as both characters mix curiosity with survival.And Dren...well IT is one crazy specimen, psychologically interesting and visually frightening. As the credits began to role I finally understood a phrase I've heard for a very long time and that is ""there are some things man should not tamper with"". I assume this was also director Vincenzo Natali's goal, which for this viewer he has certainly achieved beyond all expectation.I give this film 10 out of 10 not because it's ""THAT good"" but because its groundbreaking approach towards this subject is both sick and original.

The actor and actress playing the leads - boyfriend and girlfriend scientists - are captivating, and interplay very nicely. The fact everything is completely scientifically unrealistic doesn't really matter. As for the weirdness, this really is out there. Early on there are some extremely uncanny moments, and whole sections which are grimacingly weird. Later on things get horrible, and at times, well, really screwed-up. It's weirdly light, or darkly funny, and horrible at the same time. The whole premise is strange, and packs a punch - you've got to see it to appreciate it.

It's very disappointing that people, based on these reviews, seem to be so desensitized they think it's OK. Comparisons to ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Fly"" don't ""fly."" The movies are absolutely nothing alike.There are moral/ethical reasons why chimera is taboo. For all intents and purposes, they're not addressed in this movie. An attempt to condemn the horrors ""Splice"" depicts, versus a nonchalant shrug of the shoulders, might have jacked it up to three stars. A serious attempt to explore the implications, which would include depicting the protagonists as mini Mengele monsters not worthy of air, might have made the movie at least somewhat acceptable.As it stands, this movie has no redeeming value whatsoever.

This movie does a good job at that, but it loses sight of the things that are important to keep it interesting. It doesn't have any memorable humour, drama, or horror, so it didn't come as a surprise to me that Splice slipped by so unnoticed since its release.All the actors are fairly enthusiastic in their roles, even though the cast is small. The creature-effects are great and every scene with one of the creatures is a joy to watch. I think one of the problems of Splice is that it doesn't know what tone to take. There are moments that it leans more towards drama-sentiment, and moments like at the end almost feel more like a horror movie. I would have liked it better if the creators focused more on certain parts of the story, so that the overall movie would perhaps feel a bit less schizophrenic.At the end of the day, there's nothing really wrong with Splice, and I would love to see what the director and the rest of the staff can come up with in the future. Its just that this movie could have worked out so much better with the concept that is has, if the creators had put more guts into it.

Granted, the end has been seen profusely in other horror/scifi films. Granted, not every detail concerning the lab was taken care of.

To everyone: This films succeeds in delivering an amazing blend of humor, science, special fx (very, very well done), sensuality, biology, suspense, entertainment...how about that?. The very great and creative design of the creature (and its development from early age to further in time) is already a call to watch something NEW and very creative and artistic. I never really cared too much for Adrien Brody (I am rather sick of his hairdo), but Sarah Polley is a first-rate actress and here she remains in her standards. The cinematography, color, general sceneries and digital effects are beautifully done. The core of the story (though not original) has some twists here. Still, there ARE implications in the script as to where are molecular biology and genetic manipulation going to. In this little almost bed-time story, there's a lot of food for thought concerning the latter issues, and concerning the various ways (around nine, right now, I guess) a child can be born *wihout* any sex nor emotional and/or physical connection between their parents involved.

""Why?"" you ask? There are so many reason, I really don't know where to begin. First of all, I'm extremely disappointed because the movie touts itself as a Sci-Fi thriller. There is very little science-fiction, and the movie was hardly scary. All nine people seated in the movie theater (which should have been my first hint this movie sucked) winced more as a matter of the unpleasant sexual activities on the screen than any cinematic suspense. Seriously. Imagine Jurassic Park where the zoo-keepers have sex with the dinosaurs, and you have an idea of the major plot elements of this movie.

Twenty percent of the dialogue is THAT bad.The ease with which these two characters perform their secret experiments was silly. At one point Elsa jumps into the lab while Clive bangs on the locked door outside. Voila! Ten seconds later a complicated scientific procedure is complete! That was easy.The main characters took turns playing good cop/bad cop so many times I couldn't follow the story. First, Clive is the voice-of-reason, he tries to talk sense into Elsa. Then he goes crazy, taking the laws of God, nature, and the United States into his own hands; Elsa tries to stop him. Then back, then forth, then back again, and forth again. Neither of these two people could decide what their motivation was, what they wanted.I didn't care about anybody on the screen. I nearly walked out, but forced myself to stay, just to see what happens.The special effects were good.

Instead of raising a genuinely adult and freethinking question about cloning, genetics, stem cells (and all that other scientific stuff), it spoon fed me, like so many other science fiction films before this.There where plenty of poignant moments within this movie where they could have taken the viewer on an existential journey of questionable morals, the science vs religion question and the whole Darwinian theory... However, it just went for the sucker punch.. ""The 3 s's"", Shock, Show and Say! If you like Science Fiction for it's escape from reality, it's lavish backdrops and ability to arouse the eye with scenes of bizarreness, then this film may well be for you...But if you are like me and like Science Fiction to give you food for moral thought, question the very reality we perceive, transport us into a world that give countless reams of possibilities...

It has not moral implications and it lumber's along like Frankenstien's monster in endless pointless drooling fodder. I think the sexual scene was stupid and ridiculous. Another waste of money for the sake of art. The end is dumb and it seems they edited the crap out of the story leaving key plot points on the cutting floor. Not sure why one would say this was a good movie. It's like a Jerry Lewis movie done wrong. Brody's acting is once again unbelievable and it seems as if he would do any movie for the money. The actress playing Dren did a superb mime job and it was totally unnecessary to have the sex scene and the rape scene. It could have been so much better, but instead they chose to ham it up for the previews. How can those small wings lift the creature and allow it to carry a person over 150lbs?",Splice
155,peterlane5,Good for the most part.,7,5 June 2010,"Great Sci-fi movie even with it's flaws. The dialog and effects are top notch. The three main characters(Clive, Elsa, and even the creature Dren) are very well developed. I really enjoyed that most of the events are foreshadowed. The acting is great especially Delphine Chanéac who plays Dren. Even though she has no dialog she still.lt captures that essence of an animal(or something animal like). She reminds me a lot of Doug Jones who has played creatures such as the Faun and the Pale Man in Pan's Labyrinth, Abe Sapien in the Hellboy movies. The story is great up until about forty five minutes before the end where it just kinda takes an almost noesdive. It starts off with a scene which I wont ruin but is laughable and then it's just clichéd until the end. Don't get me wrong I still enjoyed the last forty five minutes but not as much as I did the other hour of it. All in all it's a good movie with one disturbing part and an OK ending.",Splice
156,robnero,Loved this flick,9,1 April 2019,"Suspension of disbelief is a given of course but this sci fi flick is about the possible dangers of genetic manipulation and man's hand at playing God. In this story the results can be positively terrifying and that we never know what the end result mega evolves into being! Exciting, well acted, written and directed. Very much a thrill and at times horror definitely worth the watch I've recommended it to all my friends. Some of the negative comments written are by people that clearly don't want to be entertained and are looking for some type of validation of them beings smarter. Its fun and it's a thrilling movie!",Splice
157,Loving_Silence,Could have been so much better,5,1 July 2012,"Splice is one of the most disappointing films of 2009. When I heard the film's premise, I was really excited. It could have been an amazing Sci-Fi film, but last 3/4 of the film was ridiculous and very off-putting. Although the visual effects are great and the design of the creature throughout its formation was really interesting.The movie started out solid, I actually enjoyed the film for a while, like I said, the effects looked great and very atmospheric, The acting was good and very believable, my favorite of the cast was Sarah Polley, who's always great. At first, I really bought the relationship between two scientists and the creature/hybrid, whatever you want to call it. But as the movie progressed, I thought it was becoming much more provocative and scandalous, not in a good way, though.The biggest flaw in the movie, for me has to be the last 20% of the film, especially the stupid ending. It falls apart and becomes so clichéd at the end, it really bummed me out because it had so much potential and it could have been very interesting and really cool. It quickly dissolves into a run-of-the-mill monster flick. The ending transformation was so ludicrous and completely odd, that it lost me so badly, that I simply can't recommend the film.",Splice
158,Reef-Shark,"A great movie ruined by a tacked on ""marketable"" ending",6,26 June 2010,"hope there is a director's cut of Splice. I really, really, REALLY hope with the DVD it will be like 2007's I Am Legend and have on a bonus disc the film's original ending. Why do I say this? Well, I haven't researched much, but Warner Brothers once again - just as in I Am Legend - has a decent sci-fi movie that ends on a low-note. I'll put it this way: up until the final 15 minutes I thought Splice was one of the best science-fiction films I'd ever seen.Just about everything in Splice works up until it reaches a generic, action climax. Great acting from the cast and a sympathetic creature make the film a compelling sci-fi drama. One of the best I've ever seen. An easy 5/5 movie....until suddenly some executive seems to have decided the film needed to transform into a horror creature-feature in the last fifteen minutes. It becomes so generic and predictable in these last 15 minutes and....terrible. I can't see any explanation for this other than Warner Brothers repeating I Am Legend.Dren (the creature) was NOT a monster. She was a fascinating individual creature that I could feel sympathy for. The way Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley) interact with Dren is very powerful. You can tell that the characters come to love Dren and that Dren cares about them, making for a tragic, yet powerful ending to the film...until the before mentioned last 15 minutes appears which almost completely ruins this drama.Now, seeing as the film will be released on DVD/Blu-Ray I'm hoping to see an addition with ""Controversial Original Ending!"" (by controversial they of course mean the GOOD ENDING). I will re-evaluate the film at such a time as an alternate cut is released. I refuse to believe that Guillermo del Toro, the writer of Pan's Labyrinth (who is the executive producer of Splice and someone who praised the script) could have supported a script that shoots itself in the foot in the ways that Splice manages to in its final 15 minutes.When Splice is released on DVD/Blu-Ray please, please, PLEASE hold out for a cut with the ""original ending"". It may save you some money to buy a single-disc theatrical cut but please do NOT support WB's altering movies to make them ""more marketable"". Splice is a great sci-fi movie that is destroyed by a lackluster ending that is entirely inappropriate given the dramatic nature of the rest of the film. Tell Warner Brothers, and other companies that we want movies to have the endings that work FOR that particular movie. Splice was NOT intended to be a horror movie and as such WB/producers shouldn't have attempted to transform it into one with 15 minutes of sub-par creature-feature footage that destroys the poignant beauty of the rest of the film.",Splice
159,bobhartshorn,From Baby to Scary Splice,8,10 August 2010,"The icy locations of the Canadian landscape enhance the chilly atmosphere no end in this intelligent and sardonically witty spin on Mary Shelley's famous monster yarn. 'Cube' director Vincenzo Natali's latest creep-show is a refreshing throwback to the smart, body-shock prosthetics of 1980's David Cronenberg , and in particular, his remake of 'The Fly'.Named after two actors in James Whale's 1935 classic 'Bride of Frankenstein', cool-geeks Clive & Elsa (Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley) are bedfellow 'mad' scientists who secretly splice together human and animal DNA to create a new species. The resulting creature - Dren (Delphine Chaneac) - evolves at an alarming rate into a chrome-domed woman with wings, gills and a very nasty sting at the end of her tail.After being moved from her laboratory birthplace to the derelict farmhouse of Elsa's childhood, Dren ups the ambiguity stakes with increasingly unpredictable and dangerous behaviour, signalling that things might not end too well.Rather impressively, 'Splice' covers a lot of ground in its 103 minutes, successfully placing issues of ethical boundaries, motherhood, 'teenage-angst' and bureaucratic hampering under the microscope, whilst still finding plenty of room for eye-opening set-pieces, such as a botched and bloody demonstration involving two phallic abominations named 'Fred & Ginger', and a truly alarming sexual liaison in a dusty barn between the creator and their creation. Very naughty.The shift from sci-fi thriller to full-on horror movie is a relatively successful one, although it must be said that the climax could have been a lot tighter and eventful, suffering as it does from some slack pacing and muted dynamics. A tad more grue and gore wouldn't have gone amiss.On the whole though, this is a thoughtful, well acted, genre piece with enough nifty moves and latex-stretching gross-outs to make it well worth your time.",Splice
160,imajestr,Why This Movie Fails,4,17 November 2010,"It fails right from the get-go. Not that splicing human genes with animal genes isn't interesting, but the whole thing feels very stagy. By that, I mean it feels contrived and artificial. The character motivations are practically nonexistent, so from the start it feels like the writer is trying to force the entire plot.Why do Elsa and Clive want to splice human genes with animal genes? Well, just for the hell of it. They're getting shut down, anyway, so why not? Wow, what a way to take all dramatic tension right out of a plot.Since there's no real tension behind their actions, there's no real tension in the plot. From the beginning you're just thinking, boy I hope these people get killed immediately.The rest of the movie is pretty standard stuff. It moves back and forth from one character or the other being completely unlikeable, to the other character being even more unlikeable, until you're really just praying for somebody to get stabbed in the face already so something might actually happen.The writers tried to use sexual tension with a mutant as a selling point, but it's not working. Nothing drives this plot, and the whole time I was watching it I was groaning inside because, rather than find some way to propel the plot forward, the characters just worry about being ""caught."" Well, if I'm rooting against them, I could care less if they're caught. In fact, I wish they would be.So, this movie is essentially about watching an angry couple fight over their mutant baby. Without giving anything away, I have to say the third act is absolute rubbish. Since the first hour and twenty minutes had absolutely no momentum, the writers flip a switch and turn it into Jeepers Creepers without the scare factor. And the final scene is reminiscent of a sci fi channel, low budget cheese fest that ""sums things up"" for us: Nobody learned anything, and we might try to force a sequel out of this turd; Gosh, humans are jerks! Sound appealing? It shouldn't. It's not.",Splice
161,angry127,Subject Overcomes Execution,6,11 December 2010,"I've always wanted to see movies along these lines. It would seem nowadays that American audiences would be more energetic to see movies about genetic alteration. There still seems to be very few movies. And because of this, we are only left with flawed movies. Much like the movie Splice.The movie is very 2 dimensional and the rhythm of the scenes is quite shoddy. A lot of times Brody is acting very melodramatic, while the rest of the cast seems passive. We also have some other scenes where its vice versa (for good measure, I suppose).The movie does have some very powerful scenes and it does get into the dilemmas with genetic research. Some of the scenes that bring out these points are the man made animals that kill each other instead of copulating. Or just about any scene with the human hybrid animal that Brody and Sarah Polley create. This is the good part of the movie.Although, the movie does go way too heavily on the side of not tampering with ""god's genes"" and all the rest. The film doesn't really confront any real life ethical dilemmas. I guess that isn't really the point of the movie though. It seems like its more catered towards being a horror sci-fi flick. See why I call it 2 dimensional.I suppose I should say a word about the sex scene (that is the reason most people watched the movie). There is indeed sex. And it may give you a hard on. The actress playing the mutant thing looks pretty good from the thighs up (aside from the wings). Watching it makes you ponder whether or not you'd violate the creature if given the chance. I suppose you'd never know unless you were given the opportunity. I wouldn't put a stick in the ground either way.",Splice

163,sreethered,A horror movie without much horror,3,22 December 2013,"Dark castle entertainment had given us interesting piece of movies like Orphan and House of Wax. So, I expected a little much from Splice, and I am truly disappointed with it. Splice is a movie labeled as a horror movie without much on its stock to scare us. In fact, it is more of a biological thriller, much like Outbreak, or Cabin Fever. It showcases a wrongly went experiment and it's consequences, in a not so interesting manner. The movie forwards some questions about todays scientific approaches on genetics. Designer babies and artificial lives are hot topics in todays medical researches, and the future of these experiments are in fact ambiguous. May be thats what Vincenzo Natali actually wanted to give through the movie, but the premises and presentation somewhat made the movie's attention to deviate from it. Speaking about acting department, Adrian Brody still suffers from the post-pianist chaos. That guy is struggling to find a breakthrough and Splice wasn't a safe choice. With as much dry as it was, Brody doesn't even had any presence on the subject. Sarah Polly managed to give a reasonable performance, and Delphine Chanéac and Dren wasn't a bad one either. The supporting cast is as good as mannequins. Technical aspects are also passable, and the design of the creature deserves appreciation. Apart from that Splice was a mess which ridden with horror clichés and loose characters. Watch it, if you have nothing else to do......",Splice

165,PlugInYourBrain,Someone could do an awesome remake of this movie.,6,3 January 2013,"Splice has an interesting premise of two biochemists who splice together animal and human DNA, and find themselves having to relate to an otherworldly daughter.Unfortunately the premise is never really developed nor explored, and abruptly at the end makes an ill-advised turn from sci-fi into horror movie territory. The interesting premise which attracted the sci-fi buffs is discarded for a formula horror ending which, short and poorly-directed, won't satisfy horror movie buffs either. A fundamental problem is that while Dren might look creepy, she is never scary. Uttering her one line in a deep voice hardly cuts it. And she's picking off characters you don't care about.Suspense is poorly done throughout the movie, even in the horror scenes. There are no surprises, with everything telegraphed 15 minutes before it happens.Splice suffers from a lack of protagonists. The two biochemists Nicoli and Kast are not well developed characters: They're not villains by any means, but they're not likable either. The end result is you don't care what happens to either of them.The same can be said about their ""daughter"" Dren. Although Director Natali seems to try and paint her as a protagonist, it doesn't work. If she was a cute, lovable puppy, you'd root for her. But she's not cute; she's downright homely. And instead of being lovable, she comes across as someone else's spoiled teen daughter. She's hard to warm too, and so the audience never makes a connection. Another director may have found a way to do that and done properly it could have been awesome; Academy-award winning stuff. Unfortunately Natali fails here, and the end result is a movie in which you care about no one.The same can be said about the few minor characters: The nasty bosses and whiny younger brother are completely lacking in depth. I do credit Natali for casting Nicoli's brother with an actor who _looks_ as if they could be related.The characters don't act consistently. Nicoli wants to kill Dren, then for no particular reason suddenly he wants to dance with her. Kast loves her like a daughter, then for an unconvincing reason decides to taunt her, then changes her mind a few scenes later. Then Dren kills her cat for an unconvincing reason, and so on. In this movie the characters develop on cue solely so the story can advance, and not the other way around.Nicoli and Kast's motivation for creating Dren is never convincingly explained. If they were doing it for altruism ('curing cancer') or even curiosity I may have found a way to root for them, but they seemed to be doing it merely for personal glory. The science here isn't Star Trek. What they do in the movie can be done. But there's minimal explanation as to what they are doing, let alone why. Instead we are told using Star Trek pseudoscience nonsense babble. I would have liked a plausible explanation of what they are doing and why.The acting is ordinary and occasionally stilted: One of Sarah Polley's deliveries made me cringe. You might argue a story like this doesn't need great actors, but look how Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz turned the Bourne Legacy into a textbook case of how good actors can save a bad movie. To be fair Brody is an Oscar winner, Polley is apparently a capable actress, and some of the direction and dialog in Splice so bad it could get Meryl Streep nominated for a Raspberry.Much has been made about the sex scenes. They're not really a big deal, and they just don't make sense. The dialog for the second one is unconvincing, even for this movie.The good news is that Splice is watchable. In an age when promising movies like 'The Invention of Lying' and 'Seeking a Friend for the End of the World' send me to sleep in the first half-hour, that is worth something indeed. Even if it was ultimately unsatisfying, I did enjoy Splice and it did give me food for thought. If you are a fan of Gothic sci-fi (not to be confused with horror) then by all means check Splice out, but keep your expectations in check.I just wish Director Natali had taken his time to develop his characters into something more likable and explored the premise instead of tacking on an unsatisfying horror finale. Someone could do an awesome remake of this movie.",Splice
166,p_jones92,Completely not deserving of all the hype,3,10 May 2011,"Once again, I'm amazed at how a movie such as this gets the score it gets on IMDb.I can't remember the last time I've been so bored watching a movie. I'm glad I didn't catch this in the theaters because I'm pretty sure this would have been the very first movie I ever walked out of. I hear tales of other films in which people were supposedly so bored they left half way through and I would never have even imagined myself doing such a thing until now.The premise of Splice is that two scientists (who are also a couple who don't have children) illegally create a new human/animal hybrid species and, despite nearly killing it in the beginning, don't because they develop paternal instincts for it, that is until it grows up into a monster. This premise sounds like good horror fare, but it's let down in several major departments.The first is the script which, at times, absurd. I mean the final third of the movie has the male scientist Clive (played by Adrien Brody) first trying to kill the monster (Dren played by Delphine Chanéac), then falling in love with it and having sex with it, and then being killed by it (this is supposed to literally happen in the space 2 days - who tries to kill something and then fall in love with it within 2 days? And that something being a human/animal hybrid of all things). At the same time the female scientist Elsa (played very badly Sarah Polley) loves the monster as if it's her own child, then hates it and cuts off its tail to perform experiments on it, then loves it again, then gets raped by it, and then thinks twice about killing it after it's already raped her (and it's this delay that gets Adrien Brody's character killed), then kills it but not because it raped her but because it killed her partner and, if the ending is to be believed, is now pregnant and willing to have a baby from being raped by the monster. It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard, let only had to painfully watch.Secondly, this is billed as a horror movie but it's not scary in anyway, all of the supposed scares are signposted well before they happen, so you know who is going to die and when, and you know when the monster is going to jump on screen, which just adds to the boredom. Horror movies are supposed to surprise and scare you, not give you big warning flags about scary moments coming up.Thirdly, the acting is bad, I mean really bad. You don't believe in either Sarah Polley's character being a super bright scientist who just wants to help save lives by creating this new monster to harvest special proteins, or in her somehow developing paternal instincts to the monster she's created. There is no chemistry between Sarah Polley or Adrien Brody, so you don't believe in them being a couple, hence you don't believe that he's willing to go along with it out of love for her, or that he then becomes attracted to the monster because it looks like his lover because she used some of her DNA to create it.Finally, the pace of the movie is soooooooo slow, it's only in the last 15 minutes that anything remotely action orientated happens, the rest of the time is spent on boring conversations about whether creating a new species is right, or how they can't kill this creature because it's like a child etc, it's boring.I don't get this movie at all, it doesn't know if it's supposed to be a horror movie or high brow social commentary on the dangers of gene science (or a splice of the two - pun intended). It fails on both those, and many more levels. I'd steer well clear of this movie, it's not worth the effort.",Splice

171,gigadragon12,"Splice is a unique, if flawed, experience.",7,5 June 2010,"Splice is the story of two genetic scientists that work for a medical company. They are working on animal drugs as the movie opens up by combining several animal genes into one mixed creation. They present it with good remarks and want to push the genetic material to include human DNA in the hopes of creating super cures for human borne diseases. They're hopeful outlook is not shared by the higher ups, and they are told to not continue their experiments. They do. The result is Dren, the first case of human DNA splicing, and the story heads into a twist of family ethics and creature horror movie.Splice has several good points to it. First off, the acting by the three main actors is good, not Oscar worthy, but you won't hurting for good emotional scenes. Second, the story is, while a creature movie, quite unique in the testing on human DNA, making a statement about the restrictions of such experimentation. Well, so what, you're saying, that's the Frankenstein story rehashed. Well, the biggest point to make is that this story doesn't take the Frankenstein approach of a monster misunderstood much. Dren is treated by her creators as a human being and raised practically as a child, the movie takes a much more human standpoint on how something becomes a monster, and thus the statement becomes more human than Science Fiction.To turn that on its side, this statement of human involvement in the creation of monsters, is exactly what can make the movie sometimes not so great. This movie is classified as a Sci-Fi flick, and not really very appropriately. While Splice starts in the realm of Science Fiction, it drops that pretty quickly once the scientists begin to treat Dren as a person and not an experiment and it becomes a statement of family ethics. While not entirely bad, it can make the movie in general seem pretty deceiving at times. They don't really go into the basis of the creature, what it was combined with, and what little science fiction there is doesn't really fill you up. In general it doesn't stick to its genre, but that doesn't kill it alone, its still good if you disregard that. Where the movie drops the ball is in the minor flaws, subtle actions that, are taken in every Horror movie, where the teenage girl locks the door and runs up the stairs yelling and screaming and stomping so that you know the killer will find her, rather than making intelligent survival choices. Well the same thing happens in Splice, and some decisions catch you off guard and leave you wondering, why would an educated scientist capable of splicing DNA make such a decision? The characters are well developed, every character from the scientists to Dren are all well developed and dynamic. They all undergo changes from the over endearing mother to the less than caring scientist and back and forth and back and forth. These developments are all well portrayed considering the situation. Things get weird around the end of the second act, and that's where things really get awkward in the movie. None of it is completely unforeseen though, and its not going to be knocking Saw off its low horse in the twist department.Essentially, Dren is a drama with Science Fiction and Horror elements. It focuses on family mechanics and the emotional damage that these things have on things and make them monsters in such a fashion. Psychologically thrilling and terrifying, it would be almost right to call it a thinking persons Sci-Fi. Unfortunately, a few characteristics knock Splice off of that throne, and it stands as something that just barely makes the grade, a few questionable actions and some scenes near the end of the movie all make it hard to swallow, yet still enjoyable. You should see it, but it won't be taking many if any awards.",Splice
172,rocky_lifter69,"It's something different and compared to most modern horror, that wins",7,11 June 2010,"If you are a horror fan like myself, then I'm sure you've felt the pain of the recent trend in Hollywood of remaking classics and pumping out PG-13 horror aimed at tweens. Something fresh, original and exciting is a rare find in the genre these days and even more rare is something generally suspenseful and scary. Splice manages to be one of those two and for that reason, it is head and shoulders above most modern horror.The story is classic 'scientist screwing with nature' at it's core. Clive and Elsa are two married scientists at the head of a program that is splicing DNA to create new lifeforms in order to create and harvest useful proteins for a variety of reasons. They have a rousing success in creating a completely original species and want to move to the next step: adding human DNA to the mix. The owner of the company balks at this idea, citing both legal and ethical reasons and instead wants them to move forward with cultivating from their created worms. The two decide to splice the DNA cocktail including human and let it sit until the right time. After doing so, Elsa decides on a whim to just attempt to make a viable embryo, to see if it will actually work. Clive objects but the embryo quickly grows and is born within days. The resulting creature metamorphoses into an off little creature and the pair decide to observe it's rather fast life cycle while they have the opportunity. The creature, who Elsa lovingly names Dren, rapidly matures into a humanoid, with Elsa acting almost as a mother to her. They hide her in an old storage floor of their research facility and act almost as her parents. Everything comes unraveled when a public presentation of the two created worms turns nasty as one had transgendered into a male and the two fought each other to a gory death in front of the media and a live audience. This forces Elsa and Clive to move Dren to the childhood farm house belonging to Elsa, as the research facility is now under heavy watch. While at the farm Dren begins to rebel against Elsa, who was revealed to have been abused by her mother. When Dren reacts badly to a gesture by Elsa, she removes part of Dren's tail and uses it to get the protein needed by the company. Clive, having grown distant from Elsa, is seduced by Dren and they have sex, which Elsa walks in on. This, combined with Clive discovering the the human DNA in Dren came from Elsa, makes the two of them realize that things have gone too far and it's time to end it. They return to the farm to find that Dren is ill and dying. They bury her body after her death and begin to burn any signs she was there. As they do this, their supervisor and Clive's brother arrive and demand to know where the creature is (the brother knew all along and the strains Elsa cultivated were found to have human DNA). As soon as they tell them Dren is dead, there is a loud shriek and they see Dren's new transgendered male form. He quickly picks off the brother and supervisor as Elsa and Clive scatter into the woods. The creature targets and rapes Elsa before killing Clive. Elsa is then able to kill Dren with a rock across the skull. The movie ends with Elsa negotiating a deal with the owner of the company, which is revealed to involve the baby Elsa is now pregnant with.The two things that stand out the most in this movie is the top notch acting and the special effects. The three leads take a premise that could have easily been very campy and make it a lot more believable than it should be. Special mention should go to Delphine Chaneac, whose first role as Dren is nothing short of amazing. Striking just the right balance between scared animal and curious child, she is so convincing it's downright scary. Her performance, coupled with some of the best special effects seen in a while, make the creature both interesting and later threatening.The downfall of the movie is it's third act. What starts as a timely and interesting concept abruptly becomes a monster in the woods movie. Add to that the snicker inducing sex scene and it's easy to see that the writers must have started with an awesome idea but then didn't know how to end it. If a better ending had been attached, this easily could have gotten a 9.The true merit of this movie is viewing it as a cautionary tale of the times. Science is doing so many new and unusual things these days and this movie is a not-so-far-out-there tale of what could happen if you screw with mother nature. If you can get past the rough ending and some very cavalier takes on science, the movie is strong enough on the acting of the leads and suspenseful enough early on to merit a viewing.",Splice

174,marcusdestorm,Come to Earth and they will autopsycate you,8,25 February 2012,"First of all, Splice, is not a comedy thriller! Secondly, Splice, is not a comedy science fiction thriller, either! Splice, we feel has been wrongly labelled, as someone usually does when it covers the topic of Gentics and Cloning. So it is no wonder that for such a great movie (wait for it) to emerge from the Gaumont & Copper Heart Studio's ran the risk of being sidelined, even struck down by cinema goers all over the world.At first, we racked our brains and tried to recall any other film being of the like, and slowly and as sure as eggs are eggs, we remembered one or two films along the same premise. Nevertheless, Splice had something more to offer than just a similar plot like the others! In fact, by watching the trailer first before the film (which is something we seldom do in case it spoils the film) we found the opening titles perturbing, to say the least.Dr. Clive Nicholi (Adrian Brody) and Dr. Elsa Kast (Sarah Polley) are two of the best Genetic Scientists in the world. With the ban on experimentation in Stem Cells, it is both Nicoli and Kast, who create the first living ascension being since Dolly the Sheep, and through differentiating other DNA within the project they come up with what appears to be some kind of worm-like being. As with all projects, however, the program is designated to be closed down by the Administrator, Joan Chorst (Simona Maicanescu), who through her deputy, William Barlow (David Hewlett – Stargate Atlantis), demands that they have something to present at the upcoming pre-press release for the stock holders in the company.Before the presentation, however, the two decide to go out of their way and create something that they believe to be everything! And everything it is, too, with a piece of DNA from almost every living species on the planet within its body. It is this that had us watching even more, especially when after only a few hours, the new (secret) project that the they have indulged in begins to growevolve and cause problems from the very first moment it is let loose from the artificial womb. Enter Abigail Chu (Child Dren), who comes across like some ""Thingy-Me-Bob"", or, as we liked to refer to it a ""T-Rex Miniature"".For a short time the film revolves around the two scientists checking on their official project, while tending to Dren when they get the free time to educate and teach her to be that little bit more human. With education, of course, comes the concept of intelligence, no matter how you look at it.As Dren grows older she is given more freedommaybe too much! As the days and nights pass quickly, it is now up to the two scientists to decide whether Dren remain a scientific secret, or she become exposed to the world as the experiment that she is! Splice was a great movie to watch. The laboratory style ""Frankenstien"" recreation was thrilling enough compared to other films of the same genre, and we believe that it for this reason alone, if you liked ""Species"", then you'll like this serving of futuristic human recreation.DVD Archive Rating: 8/10",Splice

I will allow a certain amount of insult to my intelligence also. I watched this film and I felt violated.I cannot cover in 1000 words or less about what is terrible about this movie. It is simply impossible to do.First I will say a good thing about it. The only good thing. The first 20 minutes or so. I actually thought that this was going to turn out to be a movie that I would enjoy very much. I love sci-fi. I hate garbage.For some reason, after the first 20 minutes, the direction and story of the film simply went awol. The story from this point on becomes a montage of pretty well every film I have ever seen in my life!. These montages last for about 30 seconds each. Needless to say that, all together, this was utter nonsense. (Like I said, I can't explain with 1000 words).One of the worst insults to my intelligence was when they decided to move the 'splice' to the country place. Despite years of marriage the husband had no knowledge whatsoever of the wife owning this place (Left by her mother I assume). They decide to keep the creature in the barn. A building that looks as though it was constructed before we ever even heard of Billy The Kid. The property is uninhabited (uninhabitable actually) and looks to have been so for at least a generation. But, low and behold....we still have electricity....and all the lights work! I don't have the space to go into the much more solid structure of the house beside the barn that seems to be about 6 months abandoned and without electricity, of course. I wish I could of had a brain scan at this particular scene. Would have been interesting to see what activity started to shut down.Well, I wasted time and intellectual effort into watching this movie and at this point into my review I am beginning to feel that I am wasting a few brain cells telling you about it.I am going to be selfish now.

180,dawn-clover,A great Horror/Sci-Fi movie that falls a bit short in the end,7,21 April 2011,"""Splice"" tells the story of two biochemists who clone a human / animal hybrid. This was enough to get me off my seat and watch the movie.And it didn't disappoint, at least in the Sci-Fi department. During the majority of the movie we see the evolution of this new creature, who they name Dren, and it's very interesting to see how it evolves and how the two scientists deal with it. On the horror department, it disappointed me. I saw it coming from miles away, the ending was way too predictable.The movie is excellently acted, and the production values are off the roof! Amazing visuals, and it's amazing how Dren looks! The photography is also top notch and the color palette succeeds at transmitting the proper ambiance when needed.The strongest feature of this movie is how it makes you cringe, feel awkward and wonder if it's OK or not to be feeling what your feeling, because the movie puts the viewer through some very awkward scenes. This is also represented in the characters as they progress, but I won't spoil anything to you.Overall, despite the cliché ending this is a strong Sci-Fi flick which you should definitely watch if you enjoy the genre. It'll interest you through most of the ride and even though you won't be amazed by the end, you will surely be even more interested.Why? This might be Sci-Fi...

181,kezopster,Choose Species over this!,4,4 November 2010,"Wow... I don't write many negative reviews, so this is new for me. I'm not sure where to begin. First of all, I'm glad I watched it on my PS3 at 1.5 times the speed. After the first 45 minutes, the pacing was just too slow. Even then, I kicked it up to 10x a few times. I'm all for mood and atmosphere, but c'mon! Stylistic issues: the ""groovy"" scientist ""nerds"" in the movie drive a Gremlin? Really? I mean, pu-leeze! I get that the film maker is trying to suggest that these are scientists, so driven by their individual genius that they don't fit into society, but really... an AMC Gremlin? In many ways, it's the perfect mascot for this dog of a movie. I'm old enough to remember the Gremlim... how it was AMC's answer to, um, Ford's Pinto! And that's how this movie felt, like an AMC Gremlin in response to Species.I don't like to pick on individual actors. After all, I've been wonderfully entertained by Steve Buscemi or Owen Wilson enough times that I'm okay with an actor NOT fitting the mold of Hollywood beautiful (like, say, Tom Cruise or Ben Affleck). But unlike his role in ""Predators,"" he just didn't work for me in this movie. Pleae don't get me wrong, his acting was impeccable. He fit the part of a geeky scientist, much like Brent Spiner or Christopher Lloyd... but really... he's NOT the person I want to stare at for nearly two hours.Unfortunately, for me, the same applies to Sarah Polley. She may well be ""... a favorite of critics for her sensitive portraits of wounded and conflicted young women in independent films"" (as her IMDb.com profile reads). However, she's not someone I want to spend nearly two hours staring at.I hate how shallow both of those paragraphs sound, but I'm just keeping the experience of watching this dreadful movie as real as I can.I love the premise of the movie. I heard an NPR interview concerning this movie that talked about the threat of gene splicing and I was anxious to see it. At times, it seems to promise to turn into something more like ""Alien,"" but doesn't. Maybe more like a modern day treatment of ""Rosemary's Baby?"" Had the leads been played by more attractive actors... had the pacing been a faster... if the storyline didn't wind up so predictable at the end... change any one of those and it would have been a better movie. Meanwhile, my advice? Pass on this one unless you're REALLY bored.",Splice
182,PopcornJury,"stay away from Splice, an overly stupid, sexual, and insane science fiction film about a hideous looking dragon/baby named DREN.",2,29 November 2010,"Splice was worse than I could've ever imagined. I knew it was about the creation of some sort of half-human, half-animal and I knew it was about the ethics regarding whether an entity is entitled human rights regardless of whether it is an illegal science experiment or not. What I didn't know is the film would start as a science fiction film, dive into dramatic territory in the middle, turn into a psycho sexual snuff film towards the end, and conclude itself as a horror film with a flying creature intent on murdering anyone and everyone in its sight. Every minute I watched this film I thought to myself just one thing, ""WHY DON'T YOU JUST KILL THIS DAMN CREATURE.""Splice stars Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley as two scientists on the brink of finding a protein that can cure a variety of terminal diseases. In developing the protein, they must create new organisms by splicing animal genes with plant genes and a variety of other chemical combinations. The next logical step for them is also an extremely illegal one: splice human DNA with animal DNA to create a human/animal hybrid that will carry enough of the necessary protein to make a substantial contribution to the scientific field. When the experiment goes horribly wrong, DREN is born, a freaky baby/dragon looking creature with a really bad temper. In what should conclude with the termination of the terribly executed science experiment, turns into an ethical discussion on whether or not the creature has rights. Let me tell you, any creature with a venomous tail that sprouts out when it gets angry does not have human rights regardless of it's DNA.Splice dives into dangerous territory when the scientists decide to adopt (secretly of course) DREN as less of an experiment and more of a child. They dress it in human clothes, teach it to read like they would a human, and feed and play with it just like they would a baby. The film really goes off the deep end when DREN hits puberty (she develops and ages at 50x the human rate) and she decides to get sexual with her ""father"" (Brody). This leads to a variety of other oddly sexual scenes which end up taking the movie down a path not once foreseen in the early stages of the film. It's weird, creepy, stupid, and continually begs the question ""WHY DON'T YOU JUST KILL THIS DAMN CREATURE.""Splice is one of the worst films of the year. It's a stupid mix of genres that culminates in the worst way possible. It's not scary, it's odd, it's not creepy, it's just plain gross, and it's not just stupid, it's completely idiotic. I don't know how the actors took themselves seriously caring for this alien creature, kissing it, dancing with it, and eventually having sex with it. It's just wrong, regardless of your outlook on the state of human rights. This creature should've been killed at day 1. If that was to early, they should've terminated on day 2. They let the problem go on too long, continually hoping DREN would get better. Sadly, just like this movie, it goes on way too long, and gets worse and worse by the minute.Stay far away from Splice, I haven't been so against a film in quite some time.",Splice
183,shroyerw-1,"A bit unrealistic, but kinda' fun.",8,5 July 2010,"I really enjoyed this movie, though I've gotta' admit the most appealing thing about it for me were the cgi renditions of the spliced spawn, i.e. ""Dren"". The story itself had its ups and its downs - if that's all it had to sell it, I'd say to avoid it. The characters are fairly cookie-cutter, though for what they're intended to be they are acted quite well. I knew it had Dr. McKay but felt his role should've been a bit more frequent. Brody gave his usual stellar performance, giving the ""sincere but quite emotionally troubled"" look he's so good at giving. One could say Polley's performance was a bit flat and sterile, but that's really very much how the character is supposed to be, so she did quite well. The actress playing the human aspects of Dren was quite talented, managing a lot with facial expressions, body language and tone. My primary complaint would be the rapid-aging process - I know they have to make the character old enough to sell the sexual aspect of it, but ""she's maturing from zygote to blossoming full-grown woman in just 2 days"" is a bit too absurd, even for a low-quality flick. ""5 years later"" and ""20 years later"" subtitles are much better as far as forming a higher-quality plot. It was also quite unrealistic that all of the different parts from all of the different species were in perfect working order and Dren instinctively knew how to use them - in a real splice of this nature, she'd be a misshapen, clumsy ox of a character, not one so full of elegant assembly & grace. At least not for the scientist's very first attempt at such a thing - a few deformed fetuses would have been just the ticket.Still, in the end I found it to be an enjoyable experience. However, if cgi doesn't do much for you, then you probably won't like it as much as I did. I'd say it's still worth a view, though - in spite of the shallowness of the characters and the plot flaws, it _does_ actually managed to ask some questions which we in our zest for technological advancement really should be asking before we go anywhere near that far. It's not a very powerfully-conveyed message, but it's there. Overall experience is 2 thumbs, overall quality is 8 stars.",Splice

186,Guo_Jing,"Splice - a good film, with a few flaws.",8,4 June 2010,"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS Splice was... an interesting movie. There are flaws, like most movies, though it was far better than the average movie.Science fiction has, historically, been a story of that which may be possible at a later date; however, Splice wasn't like that. Splice was about something that, most likely, is possible now. Back in the 70s a book was written by a man who claimed to have been involved with a project to clone a human. He claimed that they succeeded, though the scientists of both his day and now say that it was all a lie.Still, there is also a chance that he was telling the truth. What if a clone walks among us today? Yet, Splice wasn't exactly about human cloning, rather human-animal hybridization. Still, there are historical examples for this topic, as well; the most notable being the 'Montauk Monster' which washed ashore July of 2008. There were many possible explanations for precisely what this 'Monster' was, and a common theory was that it was a raccoon, or some other animal. Still, one cannot help but wonder.The aforementioned flaws were comparatively minor: the characters - being fictional - were typologically inaccurate. The acting, while exquisite when it comes to Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody, could have been better by the other actors.SPOILERS Dren ('nerd' spelled backwards; fans of Happy Days may recognize it...) was formed in a laboratory as a hybrid between another creature and a human. Her 'parent' was a genetically engineered hybrid-creature which was used to synthesize a protein. The female of that species later turned into a male in a rather grisly 'murder' scene.Anymore information, and the horror (or rather, the little horror present in that film) would be even lower than the already less-than-satisfactory 'horror film'.Overall, a very good film dealing with the ethical and moral implications of cloning/hybridization.",Splice

I began watching the movie completely in the dark, so the first sci-fi hour was quite enjoyable (with some flaws), but once the ""specimen"" grew up into a mostly human and attractive female, the movie made an attempt to shift from sci-fi to creepy horror movie, and I was kicked out of the movie harshly in disbelief (the barn dance scene) and I gave up on the movie at this point and hit the eject button.

However considering the movie is still constantly on my mind, long after seeing it I feel like it merits some credit.In the film, we have two brilliant scientists (Polley and Brody) who spend there lives splicing DNA and then the obvious plan to splice human and animal DNA together eventually pops into there heads. The experiment works which creates Dren. That's all I'll say but the rest is pretty obvious.The first half of the movie is top notch and was almost flawless but at about the half way mark everything gets exponentially weirder and character motivations and actions go out the window. it's hard not to roll your eyes during most of the later scenes in the film as it just goes way out in left field. It all suits the subtle creepiness that the entire film has but it's just too much at times. Also the horror movie finale seems too rushed and it comes in a little too late.But despite it's flaws, all the good outshines the bad.It succeeds on it's brilliant and refreshingly original premise despite the fact that the actual end result doesn't fill it out to its full potential.

190,e_barker,This film is horrible,1,13 June 2010,"So Many things went wrong with this movie. One, a high-tech lab where there are NO cameras in the ""secure"" areas. I mean seriously are we supposed to believe that there were no cameras in the room with the multi-million dollar piece of equipment (fake uterus) was. Also, about that they break a multi-million dollar piece of equipment (smash it) and no one even asks what happened to it. They end up moving Dren into the basement (where no one goes), because yea maintenance and janitorial employees ever go into areas where maintenance and janitorial things are stored. OK, but those are minor things. How about we look at how Adrian Brody/Sarah Polley characters changed so quickly without explanation. Adrian Brody starts out thinking they need to kill Dren, then he thinks no we need to take care of it, and then near the end he says ""the experiment's over we no longer have an obligation to the specimen"" none of those transitions are ever explained they just happen. Sarah Polley's character does the same thing only in reverse. She starts off wanting to take care of Dren, then after Dren kills the cat she goes all kinds of crazy and wants to kill Dren and then she goes back to wanting to take care of Dren and then at the very end she wants to kill it again. Now, I guess we can say that she turns on Dren because of the abuse her mother did to her, although we are never told that not even a damn flash-back scene. Also, why did Adrian Brody have sex with Dren, it was not needed and in the scene right before that we see that she has no vagina (so we will call it Comic Book Magic. Next, they are supposed to be brilliant scientist, but they fail to notice that every single time there is a change in Dren she ""Dies"" for a bit. In the fake uterus machine she dies and then comes out, she gets drowned and dies and then develops the aqua-lungs. So they really don't see that come on. Finally, there is NO moral, I mean I guess the moral is go ahead and screw around with nature and when it kills everything that you love and rapes you, don't worry go ahead and screw around with nature some by selling your rape creature. I mean the sex scene was totally un-needed but the rape scene was just sick, and then on top of that to find out that she is just money hungry woman at the end. When she said ""What's the worst thing that can happen"", I totally wanted the camera to pan outside and see the whole city on fire.

191,cchires,Warning: This Film has Been Mis-Marketed!,6,5 June 2010,"Judging by the commercials for 'Splice' you would think that this is a monster movie with genetic cloning as a gimmick. In actuality, it's a dramatization of Freud's Electra Complex with genetic cloning as a gimmick. Unfortunately, the film didn't pull all of its elements together for a coherent entertainment, but for at least two-thirds of it, my interest was held.The product of the genetic 'splice' in this movie is called Dren (nerd spelled backwards) and she is an effective combination of real actors and special effects. She is a cross of too many animals to be named and is a real curiosity. After a rough first impression, Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley become her parental figures and main section of the movie is the dynamics of this offbeat family unit. Although their are a lot of plausibility issues with Dren's creation (you would hope their would be better monitoring of this type of science), the film draws you into the developing relationships between her and her parents. You get the feeling that had this story been played out honestly, some intriguing themes on the nature of life/family would have developed, but I guess commercial considerations required the thriller elements to take over.Some of the problems with the movie have to do with the fact that many of the characters change their nature in absence of any apparent motivation. Dren goes from precocious to hostile without any real cause and effect logic. Furthermore, my friend and I had to fill in the gaps of her behavior after the movie was over to try to make sense of it. Dren is not alone, the two human leads act in ways late in the movie that do not fit anything their characters did up until that point. Sarah Polley performs a gruesome surgery on Dren which, although it serves a plot point, is out of character and Adrian Brody does something that is just plain abominable (the audience laughed really loud at that part, by the way, which I don't think was the intended reaction).In the end all the curiosity of Dren is abandoned and she functions as a monster to scare the audience.

You've got the creature killing an animal to eat meat one second, then the female scientist saying ""she doesn't eat meat"" and that that was ""an accident"" the next second.

Rationalize for me what Adrien Brody's motivation is for doing what he does with the beastie? It is required for plot advancement, but that is tantamount to having a loaded gun fall out of the sky into a soldier's hand when he suddenly runs out of ammo. It's helpful, but explaining it is impossible.That being said, there are some interesting themes explored here(although not explored very well). Parent child relationships, incest, spousal replacement, corporate greed, the possible amorality of science in the face of ""exploration"". All are touched on, and there are some interesting moments of gore as well. This doesn't feel original to me, since Frankenstein and Species explored many of the same themes, but it sure is cool to look at, and the beasties designed for the movie are topnotch. Ms Cheneac deserves more credit than she will probably get for an amazing and completely pantomime performance that conveys the emotional realities of her character perfectly. Everyone else is just making license plates.Also, the angelic/Satan motifs are slightly heavy-handed, but still as I said, really cool to look at.",Splice

It's mad scientist sci-fi if you like that (and I do), but the scientists aren't mad, just ambitious and very talented. The acting is superb, especially the interactions between Sarah Polly & Adrien Brody who are sometimes acting as a perfectly synchronized team and other times are completely aghast with one another. Delphine Cheneac (and Abigail Chu as the younger version) play their unusual character perfectly. David Hewlett plays a convincing ambitious bureaucrat, and Brandon McGibbon is very convincing as the cooperative, but worried, junior colleague.It's a movie that starts fast and maintains a high pace of plot development throughout. You won't be bored.",Splice
197,hollyrowanmoore,"Strange, odd and a bit manic",5,19 April 2020,"The first half of Splice was highly interesting and could of been the beginning of a really good film. We see how moral arguments play into science, and the dangers of creating new species. But then the film dives into a strange second half that leaves the viewer questioning what the they just watched. Clive and Elsa take Dren (their hybrid creation) to a remote farm house for her to live in. We then proceed to see some very strange things. Clive has sex with Dren, which ultimately turns her into a man, where she then raped Elsa? It was a very odd, uncomfortable section of the film where I wasn't quite sure what was actual going through the character's heads. If you want a strange, sci-fi esque film to add to the list, then go for it. But if you appreciate a good plot line and solid story then I'd give it a miss. Splice definitely promises a bumpy ride, that leaves a memory forever.",Splice
198,saahdrahcir,The (Modern) Modern Prometheus,8,16 April 2011,"On the set of the 2005 ""King Kong"" remake, Adrian Brody had said that he wanted to do more action films rather then dramas such as ""The Pianist,"" and with roles in ""Predators"" and ""Splice,"" who could say he hasn't succeeded. Essentially, this film explored the wonders of an even more modern Prometheus than Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein."" Thankfully it was as so, because when you first watch the trailer (and take note that it is rated R for sexuality/nudity) it appears to fall into the same category as ""Species."" The latter end of the film feels a bit ""Species""-esque, but it doesn't hinder over the film. Once you accept the creature that look like an organ shot up with adrenaline in the first scene, you will accept everything that follows thereafter and you won't be disappointed.""Splice"" proposes a clever alternative to human cloning. This artistic innovation is presented through another artistic process: film. The movie overall is beautiful, elegant, and conscious of piercing tension. Director Vincenzo Natali demonstrated nothing but pure art in the evolution of the experimental specimen named Dren (""nerd"" backward; in relation to the scientists themselves) headlined by Delphine Chaneac— whose only other American film happened to be the remake of ""The Pink Panther.""Brilliant French characteristics and filmmaking, and even the fact that visionary director Guillermo Del Toro's name is tagged on as an executive producer, all enhance this project. It's a shame that besides this, all American audiences get to see of Vincenzo Natali's is a segment out of the great ""Paris, Je T'Aime"" and the lacking ""Cube."" The same goes for co-screenwriter Douglas Taylor, except that his talents were somewhat wasted on ""They Wait"" and ""In The Name Of The King: A Dungeon Siege Tale."" Each person involved in this project has been on a exponential path to prominence; however, I haven't made up my mind on which Sarah Polley I like better: in ""Splice"" or in Zach Snyder's 2004 ""Dawn Of The Dead"" remake.",Splice

The way the characters talk so much reminded me of the voice-over in the theatrical release of Blade Runner. Movies should do a plot, not talk a plot. Might make more money if they expanded the sex scenes and distributed it as porn. After watching a season of Ghost Whisperer on TV I became aware of how some characters have a limited set of facial expressions. Brody and Polley were both guilty in this movie, especially Polley. She either looked frightened or like she had just found a puppy and that's it. The only significant shift in her face came in the scene when she had Dren strapped to the ""operating"" table. If you want a more frightening treatment of the theme I recommend the book Oryx & Crake by Margaret Atwood.

203,marplesj,Terrible film that covered a poor storyline with shock tactics,1,30 July 2010,"At certain points this film made the entire cinema audience wince with disgust and groan with a sick feeling from what they were watching. A good reaction from a horror film I hear you say, well yes and no.You see the storyline spans all of 10 mins and as a result it almost seems as though the director was trying to think up of ways to keep up interest by getting gradually more perverse. Bit of blood and guts, done. Now what?....hmmm maybe an interspecies sex scene, done. Hmmm kind of stuck now, perhaps an interspecies rape scene? yep, yep that sounds good, run it.The two leads, Brody and Polley, present plenty of dim moments evident in most horror movies, which leave you asking 'really? Why the hell have you done that?' when a simple, much less ridiculous solution presents itself. This in-turn led me to disliking them somewhat, especially Polley who by the end I was literally crossing my fingers she was the next on the hitlist.The only positive thing I can say about this film is a big hats off to the prosthetics/animation team, creating a creature which was very well put together and at no stage looked like a plasticine 'jason and the argonauts' remake.",Splice
204,dgefuller,Potentially excellent drama ruined by insistence of horror,5,10 October 2010,"There's something really quite fascinating about stories where people play God. The premise of 'Splice' is a truly terrifying one; as two arrogant scientists (Brody and Polley) go against all advice to advance their pioneering genetic work which quickly spirals beyond even their own wildest expectations.It's rare you see a film these days that walks that line between social commentary, drama and horror- most settling for condescending moral lessons or brutal violence. Once in a while though, you get a film that at least tries to do more; and like Cronenberg's 'The Fly' before it, 'Splice' has a damn good go at it.The themes are obvious from the outset; the moral and ethical implication of manipulating things that we don't understand- specifically human genetics and science we just don't fully comprehend yet and taking careless risks in exchange for quick progress (refreshingly, Clive and Elsa- our geneticists, are interested in the benefits of the science rather than the quick bucks, although of course their benefactors are not so inclined). The first act of the film is actually quite brilliant- the quick establishment of the genetic programme, the introduction of the minimal (and yet somehow underused) cast, and the lightning fast appearance of Dren. Who or what exactly is our protagonist is hard to clarify; we route for the maligned Dren, forced to live in the shadows, or for the scientists taking on maternal and (forced) paternal duties? No, not really any of them- Dren would be a hell of a lot more likable if she didn't make idiotic beeping noises like a lizard ALL THE TIME (this is a mistake, they just don't fit the character at all), and it becomes apparent that she is a subject of her science- an animal that adheres to all the frightening changes that have plagued the scientists in their experiments before.Then, there's some nasty stuff that's just for the sake of it (Brody's completely reluctant to have any involvement with Dren- despite her drawing lovely pictures of him, and then all of a sudden he's becoming sexually obsessed with a sub-human chicken-legged mutant- a reversal of which happens to Polley once science does its thing), and a couple of characters who show up just to die- which would be fine, except they don't even have a remotely entertaining dispatching (it doesn't even happen on screen).The message in the film is clear, the first act is great, but the film eventually descends into a standard last act horror movie (complete with a hook that could lead us kicking and screaming into Fly II territory), and is marred by those stupid and unnecessary animal noises, and the actions of characters that happens against their identities and bypassing any reasonable development.To be honest, if they had just focused on making a sci-fi drama (like the eighties mini series 'First Born' which deals with similar themes) they would have been a lot better off, but someone had the idea of sticking horror in it. The ideas are horrifying enough without having to lower them to killing and interspecies relations (the emotional relationship that Polley strives for is heartbreaking enough without going any further- it that which just kills the film, and leaves you hoping nobody walks in when that scene is on screen if you're watching at home by yourself- you may have a job explaining it).So all in all, the first half is brilliant, which makes the conclusion all the more disappointing. The leads are great, but in that second half they just change character as if a new production team took over, as much as Brody tries to resist the shift in his character and sticks with the exasperated introvert (like in Darjeeling Limited), when he should've become a twisted mess (like in The Jacket).",Splice
205,Allentoker,Science fiction - the new Gothic horror?,10,26 June 2010,"This is a great new science fiction film from the director of the late 90s classic horror/suspense/sci-fi classic Cube, Splice has undertones of Gothic horror and psychological suspense thriller with the sci-fi overtones. Beautifully thought out story about two genetic research scientists who take their genetic research to the next level and then suffer the dire psychological then physical consequences of their curiosity and their fear and want of a child or a new wife or self gratification for ones own godly power. And that's the moral of the story, I think, is watch out when you try to take control of the power of God, for thou shalt suffer the consequences! The film has great Cronenbergian themes in it, the corruption of science, the perversion of ones own moral fabric and mental being, physical transformation and metamorphosis. All in all a great film for horror and science fiction fans, or, science reality?

It felt contrived and therefore unbelievable in terms of what the characters would do in reality. The motives are a bit juvenile for people of such intelligence and with whom such great responsibility lies. What to do in such a situation? Add some personal issues and voila!

It'll just be so much easier on your brain and the brains of others around you if you just go, see the movie, and then just leave it alone and pour yourself a bowl of Rice Krispies. Or do what I did and buy yourself a burrito from Sheetz (seriously, they are SO GOOD).It's not a BAD movie by any means, just one that if you think too much about and have an IQ higher than ""durrRED"" it'll seriously start to frustrate you. ...See, I don't know the first thing about genetics and I don't bother trying to learn it because if I wanted my brain to explode I could think of much more fun ways to do it, I'm sure, that involve a lot less reading. But the person I went with knows a thing or two, and her main beef with Dren was how genetically impossible she seemed to be at times, and also how stupid Elsa and Clive were. And as she explained it, I began to see it too. I mean I knew they were pretty thick to begin with, but Christ...In fact, upon further investigating (because like I said, thinking about it will just prove how much is wrong) a lot of her biology doesn't make much sense, nor does anyone bother trying to explain it. I can understand how hard it would be to cover the entire biology of such a complex hybrid creature all in a two-hour span while still covering, you know, the plot, but it sure would be nice to have a Wikipedia page or something to tie up the loose ends...I think the best way to describe this movie is simple; it's REALLY WEIRD. Most of the movie had me screaming at the screen, ""What is THIS?!"" but in a good way. Usually. Until Elsa came onto the screen and did something that made me want to punch her in the uterus to assure her nonsense did not carry into the next generation.But rest assured, Reader, it was definitely a good movie.

209,apres_vague,Never asked to be born,7,19 February 2019,"Elsa (Sarah Polley) and Clive (Adrien Brody) a young and ambitious couple of scientists (a punkier version of Marie and Pierre Curie) make a great team, both in private life and in their professional field of gene splicing.
The duo has been contracted by a pharmaceutical cooperation to develop a new amorphous Hybrid species spliced from numerous genes of several animals. When Elsa proposes to take the experiments to the next level and to use Human DNA, the company, afraid to be maligned by the press quickly pulls the plug. However Elsa won't give up this easily, and they continue their experiment in secrecy, splicing compatible human and animal DNA under the agreement, that their new species should never reach full term.
Their experimental species hatches faster than expected; the result is a two-legged mouse-like creature, which seems to be suffering from rapid aging. Due to Elsa's sympathy for the creature (or perhaps just for the scientific glory) she convinces Clive to let it live, assuming that it will be dead soon. Within a few days the new species, now called Dren develops into an almost human looking little girl (apart from a tail with a stinger and the lack body hair). The couple continues to observe it and start dressing it in human clothing while Elsa becomes more and more like a mother to Dren. When Dren becomes too big they hide her at Elsa's old family farm and things start to turn ugly for everyone.
Vincenzo Natali's ""Splice"" goes further than merely exploiting the cloning scare (which anyways died down a lot during the last decade) but rather works as a metaphor against child abuse and the unethical treatment of living beings.
As soon as Dren matures into a more curvy being (Delphine Chanéac) Clive begins to sexually lust after her. Elsa fails to see the signs, instead she becomes jealous that Dren might like Clive more than her and slowly changes her motherly tone, starting to emotionally abuse her while keeping her imprisoned in the old run down farm.
Elsa and Clive might not necessarily be bad people, but it's obvious, that they were not meant to be parents, and both are incapable of raising a child (especially one with special needs like Dren).
Dren has to adapt to her environment, undergoing both a mental and evolutionary change in order to survive, leading to a shocking finale. Polley is excellent (A rare case where the female ""Hero"" is actually more menacing than ""the monster""). The standout performance however comes from Delphine Chanéac, despite not having any lines (I loved the fact that Dren does not speak) and being hidden behind make-up and partial CGI. She conveys Dren's emotions wonderfully and makes her character compelling and interesting. The film is not without it's flaws; the ending seemed a bit rushed (They could have easily added another 20 minutes to build into the finale and allow it to breath easier) The Photography for most part is nothing to write home about - I have expressed my dislike for this cold green look already in the past. It is overused and ugly aesthetically, yet this glossy hospital look actually works better here (since many earlier scenes take place in a lab) and Natali does give us an occasional flavour of colour (mainly red - such as Polley's jacket and red couch pillows placed in the background). One of the better new Horror/ Sci-Fi films I have seen in quite a while, Natali's direction is strong and the script is in equal measures disturbing and a darkly funny. Also how can I not like a film that features two creatures named ""Ginger and Fred""?",Splice

However, what spoiled it for me were the sex scenes which I found very uncomfortable. I acknowledge though, that I may have a sensitive disposition. The final third was a bit flawed, for example, the fringe characters (brother, company bosses) were rather stereotypical. The scene where the male character drops his flashlight in the river is rather poor. All in all, I don't think this was entertaining in any sense and as a horror movie it lacked, ehm, horror.

The issues of raising a child, accepting gender identity and trying to maintain an objective perspective when something you love is the subject of study are all very strongly represented in the story. There are some great rock star science moments that make the film fun and the technology is entertaining if you find it interesting. The main characters Clive and Elsa are pretty much raising a science project through the first two acts. When the experiment becomes self sufficient and gets the intelligent sense to question authority, things get tough. The background story of a company working to harvest miracle genes off bio-engineered organisms secures a solid foundation for the main characters to build on. The film presents motives that are amoral, unethical and rebellious. The story is mostly unflinching and some people in the audience do feel awkward about what they are seeing. DREN is a fantastic character that goes through some drastic evolution. At times it seems like you can side with Elsa and dislike Clive and then you might reconsider that when further events unfold. Every character in this film deals with some seriously brutal events. There are some light and even silly moments to get grounded on and it makes the tough stuff that much more enjoyable when the time comes.

The film didn't know what it wanted to be, and failed to establish itself as any one thing.

Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley worked well together, though their characters are very frustrating. They portray brilliant scientists,yet they make so many stupid mistakes. Though I found this to be a good depiction of how everyone can make mistakes, it gets to a point where you're left scratching your head wondering if these two geniuses ever went to school. They continue to make mistakes but do not learn from them. This happens so often that it eventually becomes repetitive and old. Much like a modern day 'Frankenstein', there is one major difference; they do not learn from their mistakes and attempt to fix them. Furthermore, the plot itself was very bland. There are a few scenes that were disturbing, which largely has to do with Delphine Chaneac's good acting. There is on semi-twist towards the end of the film that was kind of refreshing, but it does not save the film from its boring plot. Also, there are two sex scenes that involve Dren (the Creature), that portray the psychological theories known as: The Electra Complex and The Oedipus Complex.

In my case though, I will end up erasing this movie in my head, but, I am not going to shut up since I cannot forget that I shelled out some money to watch this movie. I went to watch this movie hoping to see a quality one, but, it turned out it's a poorly edited B-Movie. The scientists in this movie are stupid, the movie proved it during the exhibit to show the two large looking larvae in an aquarium looking glass casing. Okay, why would you as a smart scientist publicly exhibit the product of your experiment without doing further experiments like maybe, put two female larvae together and see what happens, 1 female and male larvae together and see what happens, then 2 male larvae together etc. The camera angles and editing chops during long dialogue exchanges are dragging, maybe because of budget constraint proving this is in the category of B-Movies? The climax for the ending is lousy for turning Dren into a Male. It could have been more acceptable that Dren died and the Male experiment they showed with Dren when they were still both in the form of larvae was given more introduction in the movie as the final spliced experiment. The twist the writer and the director tried to insert in the movie is a work of a trying hard author and same with the director. I've seen better Indy movies.",Splice

They combined human DNA.They created an animal baby.The baby looked like mouse, snake, fish, bird, monkey and human.The baby was growing.When baby grows, their experimental animals changed gender (only females).The baby is Dren and she is 19.Dren was hiding Elsa's farm.After, she fell in love with Clive.When Elsa creating Dren, she used to own DNA. After then, Clive understood that. Many people are learning Dren. One night, Elsa , Clive and others come to Dren but Dren is male now. Dren attacked them.

226,hwaite,whiskey tango foxtrot,5,13 June 2010,"This film gets props for pioneering a new genre: the romantic-comedy-scifi-horror-thriller-drama. Production values are too solid for it to be called 'camp' but the lack of realism makes the movie hard to take seriously. The film opens with two lovebird scientists delivering a genetically engineered creature that is sufficiently amazing (and unrealistic) to drive the plot of several movies. In the Parallel Earth of Splice, however, the scientific community is none too impressed by the birthing of a radical new species: ""Yeah, those sentient penises you've grown are neat but we'd like to see synthesis of some random protein or we're shutting you down."" The H-40 chimeras are quickly forgotten and our heroes move on to the first of several fantastically stupid ideas. For the lulz, they opt to secretly grow a human/animal hybrid. Counter-intuitive as it may be, these two dolts are able to create a freakish humanoid monster with trivial effort and without anyone noticing. The director constantly reminds us that they're are all torn up inside over the attendant ethical dilemmas. As we all know, the characters will do whatever the plot requires and there's no real dramatic tension there. Never mind the outrageous intellectual, temporal and financial resources needed to achieve such a task: Dren, the lovable monster, is born.The bulk of the movie is occupied by the scientists (Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley) secretly raising CGI monstrosity Delphine Chanéac (Dren) to adulthood. A recurring problem with the story is the inconsistent scientific acumen exhibited by the two leads. They're able to effect implausibly awesome scientific breakthroughs on a whim. On the other hand, they fail to notice things that should be obvious to an undergrad biology major. Is the specimen male or female? Does it have wings? Gills? Maybe they should've given the bitch an X-Ray or something. At one point the dynamic duo fails to even recognize whether Dren is dead or alive. Some of these oversights would be excusable if they were integral to the plot. Too bad they're mostly thrown in for the sake of cheap thrills. As Dren's biology is revealed to be increasingly far-fetched, I sense a truly compelling premise being squandered upon a mediocre movie.Yet another unforgivable oversight is the needlessly limited communication with Dren. Brody and Polley are constantly wondering what Dren is thinking. Does she understand her origins? What are her hopes and dreams? What does she know of the outside world? Dren communicates via body language and incomprehensible chirps yet it's established early on that she knows English. Did nobody think to bring a pad and paper? The scientific achievement of the millennium is handled pretty casually by all parties.The director tries to use the scientists' emotional involvement as an excuse for their poor judgment but that only goes so far. The film jumps the shark when Brody elects to have sex with their creation. At this point, I decided that the whole exercise was ""tongue in cheek"" and that the joke was on me. It seemed like a subtler reenactment of the scene from Spike Jonze's 'Adaptation' where the plot starts to unravel with a nod and a wink. From this point on, clichés per minute goes off the chart as the film descends into B-Grade horror.I can't decide if this movie is genuinely ridiculous or if it just went over my head. 5-stars for making me think.",Splice
227,derekrankine,A likable but flawed sci-fi tale,6,4 March 2010,"Splice centres on two renowned young scientists (Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley) that are quasi-famous for successfully creating a new species of animal, a species with enormous pharmaceutical industry potential in the form of an ability to secrete profitable proteins. Despite a refusal by their company bosses to approve the next stage of the project, or anything that tampers with human DNA, their ambitions lead them to create a human-animal hybrid by combining human genes with those of the created species. This in turn leads to the creation of a new entity they name Dren, which they raise and attempt to study as a personal project concealed from their employers and colleagues. The story becomes highly engrossing as we follow the creature's development alongside that of the two scientists, who are in a relationship that becomes increasingly strained by a series of ethical and logistical dilemmas. The two central performances are well-judged, but the real star is Dren; or the CGI responsible for her creation, which is always convincing and solid at all stages of the creature's evolution. Vincenzo Natali's visually intense direction is also worth mentioning, and he clearly enjoys playing with a generous budget as compared with his previous features like Cube.This is, however, no modern masterpiece – the plot becomes predictable and contrived in the final third, the minor characters are little more than stereotypes (lax young brother, venal bosses) and the comedic elements of the film don't always sit comfortably with the horror aspects (there is, however, a notable exception in a hilarious scene towards the end). But these drawbacks are outweighed by the plus points, which makes Splice an enjoyable experience overall.",Splice
228,kidcolt@hotmail.com,"Darkly funny, great sci-fi satire",8,13 June 2010,"Ahh, Splice. Any movie that divides audiences as thoroughly as Splice does has merit in my book. Splice is dark, funny, and satirical, squeezing in some fun ethics questions and a healthy dose of cheesy b-movie corniness. It moves at a glacial pace to begin, and slowly creeps along occasionally peppering you with some intentionally corny drama/horror, and a couple parts that are equal parts funny and disturbing, before it gets really going. It's incorrectly marketed as a horror film in the vein of an old 'Jeepers Creepers'-type film, when in fact it's more of a sci-fi ethics drama that bounces off the walls of a few different genres along the way.Brody is solid, The effects look good, and it's nice to see the inherently likable Sarah Polley take on the part of a truly unlikable character for once.Go in with an open mind and enjoy the twisted fun.",Splice

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I have never laughed so hard at a movie in my life, and this movie wasn't even supposed to be a comedy. The script was abysmal, there was no chemistry whatsoever between the actors, and the situations the characters got themselves into were just ludicrous. By 20 minutes into the movie, I was wondering why I'd spent any money on it. By the end of the movie, I felt no sympathy for or connection with any of the characters, and I was just waiting for the movie to be over. I almost walked out three separate times, and the only reason I stayed was because I made the mistake of spending money. People are comparing this movie to ""Alien"", and it's like comparing apples to oranges; ""Alien"" is immeasurably better. If you want to see a decent sci-fi movie, do not watch this tripe.",Splice
230,Rick_Gershman,A gorgeous train wreck of sci-fi horror,5,2 June 2010,"The new sci-fi thriller Splice, a modern-day take on Frankenstein that opens Friday (June 4) in theaters, is a gorgeous film that impresses on many levels.The visuals are breathtaking, a perfect balance between practical and computer-generated effects. The cinematography and art direction often are stunning.The stars are two top-notch actors, Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley, in what is essentially a three-character piece for the majority of its running time. And through its first two acts, the film surrounds viewers with a constant feeling of tension and discomfort peaking with one of the darkest scenes I've seen in a mainstream film in awhile.And then the third act arrives, and Splice takes a abrupt nosedive right into the crapper.With one incredibly miscalculated, over-the-top scene, Splice suddenly pitches any empathy we had remaining for our characters and devolves straight into camp.I'm guessing writer-director Vincenzo Natali didn't intend that, since the following scene is supposed to be heavy and serious, but viewers in my screening laughed through the entire thing. The film never recovers, devolving into an even-sillier resolution that tries way to hard to uncomfortably marry an action-film climax with the dark parenting and sexual metaphors that dominated the second act.I'll only say a tiny bit about Splice's plot to respect its twists and turns. Natali's story wears its Frankenstein influence on its sleeve, even naming its main characters after the actors (Colin Clive, Elsa Lanchester) who starred in the 1935 classic Bride of Frankenstein.Thus we're introduced to Clive (Brody) and Elsa (Polley), scientists who are partners inside and outside the lab. The pair are splicing together the DNA of various animals in hopes of finding cures for diseases.All goes well until the lab's corporate parent puts profit ahead of technology, prompting the pair to initiate a secret experiment of their own: mixing human DNA with animal. In short order, they're the sorta- proud parents of Dren, a brand-new lifeform — part little girl, part kitchen sink of DNA — who has to be seen to be believed.Bringing Dren to life is not only the most impressive thing Elsa and Clive do — it's far and away the most impressive thing Splice does. Dren is mostly portrayed by French actor Delphine Chanéac — and she does an excellent job, in fact — but Dren also is a mix of great makeup and extremely believable CGI.Too bad the story isn't anywhere near as believable. Natali (who co- wrote and directed the brilliantly original Cube back in 1997) clearly is aping director David Cronenberg — particularly The Fly and The Brood — but where it comes to story and characters, Natali doesn't have Cronenberg's chops. Whereas the shocks in Cronenberg's films tend to be deeply disturbing, most in Splice just come off as outrageous.Again, there's a lot to like about Splice, especially the aforementioned cinematography and art direction, which are respectively by Tetsuo Nagata and Joshu de Cartier. The makeup and special effects, led by Howard Berger and K.N.B. Effects Group, are out of this world.Splice does have some very effective scenes drenched with (occasionally too-obvious) metaphor. And despite some occasionally clunky dialogue, the performances are uniformly strong, particularly Polley, giving her all for what ultimately becomes a very silly movie.Brody is solid, but the best part of his casting is that he kinda looks like the result of a gene-splicing experiment in the first place.Sadly, it's all in service of a story that goes completely off the rails in its final act — and sorry, that's about all I can say to avoid spoiling it. I'll cut Natali some slack on the final 15 minutes, because they smell like studio influence and possibly re-shoots. But Splice jumps the shark well before then, wrecking some fantastic film-making in one fell swoop. Rating: R",Splice

The characters were good, it was so unpredictable like many other films. It gets you away from kitchen sink dramas and the sci fi genre is taking off once again. This was slightly different from your usual sci fi as it involves experiments by laboratory scientists. Which is plausible. I just hope they make a sequel, I for one will be among the first to see it. Of course, there would have to be new characters, but the plot is there, the scientists have a discovery, the money has been offered and yet to be accepted. In all, it leaves the way open for a follow up which is badly needed.

Despise the negatively, I was still tempted to watch this film. So I'm immediately going to say, this was not bad at all. I was actually very impressed if not, overly satisfied. From what I was hearing, I thought it would be hell to get through this one. Fact of the matter is, though many will argue it's a bit unoriginal withing the confines of it's genre, I still believe it was an effective film. What made it effective? The problem with many other films who have tried similar plots to this is that they simply do not hold the caliber in quality. Splice was a film that was destined to be made in this era. The plot is believable, the special effects were decent, hell, they were damn good and it's a film that moves along at a rate that was neither fast or slow. You develop emotions and connections to the characters. Adrian and Sarah were good and Delphine did a superb job as Dren. I would honestly say this film deserves a higher IMDb score. The film made an impression that was much more worthy of a 6.5. The film has it's little plot twists here and there and at times it leaves you wondering. People complain about the ending, but come on... it's not like you didn't have an idea of what was going to happen from the beginning. You may say that's what they failed at, but let's be realistic, in real life something of this magnitude would have not had a happy ending.

239,jatigre1,The Chupacabras real story,8,30 January 2012,"The same mystery surrounding certain psychics sometimes finds its way into movie scripts, believe it or not. We don't really know exactly how this works, but that doesn't change the fact that these ""coincidences"" happen.Maybe the same psychic connection, perhaps the collective unconscious, who knows? What most people seem to have missed when they review this movie is the story itself. I guess to connect the dots one has to have a real life experience, and that's what I may have that other people don't.When I saw Dren for the first time I knew I've seen that before. I was in the military in Southern Brazil in 1991 during a field exercise when a college and I where surprised when we saw ""someone"" coming in our direction. We where on sentry duty expecting the Sargent doing his route around 1 AM. It was a dark November night in some woods behind the HQ where we where doing this 24 hour ""camp exercise"" when I saw someone coming in our direction. There was also cattle mutilations in the fields surrounding the Head Quarters and I remember someone describing being watched by ""something"".I could only see a silhouette with some lights from the city way back on the horizon. A big corporal had told us when we assumed that post to not let anyone pass without checking with us first. I told my recruit colleague: ""Here comes the Sargent"". I then look again and this silhouette appears to be ""limping"", on both legs. The next thing that goes through my mind is the training. I shout:""Hold it right there and identify yourself!"". The ""creature"" is now about ten meters away from us and walking in this weird way, exactly like Dren was when she was young.Then for the first time in my life actually freeze with fear. At the same time the creature is looking at me, directly into my eyes and in that moment I knew that somehow it could read my thoughts! And it KNEW that I was afraid. ""It"" then dropped to the ground in the most never-seen-before way and starts crawling like a cat does, towards a bush. I'm holding my flash light towards it the whole time. I look at my partner (and I almost laughed when I saw him, because he's actually black, but when we both looked at each other he was PALE WHITE, in fear!)and he is has his mouth wide open and frozen still. Without taking my eyes off from that bush I lower myself to the ground and grab a big rock and throw it into the bush. Luckily we're not carrying any live ammo. I do it again and nothing. I look at my colleague and say: ""Even if I die, but I HAVE to see what that was"". I go towards the bush and walk pass it, look around the other side where the creature was suppose to be hiding and there's nothing there, to my relief. Because we where doing this exercise we spent the rest of the night and morning doing other stuff, like survival camp and blowing up stuff, all in good military fashion. For some strange reason we never told anyone about what happened and I totally forgot about it. It was then ten years later that the name Chupacabras start making headlines.

In many ways the film addressed Greek tragedy i.e.Oedipal Complex, Shakespearean themes including death of parents at the hands of offspring for supremacy of the bloodline/species. As well, there the Ridley Scott ""Alien"" meta theme regarding the sexuality of consuming & becoming consumed during the act of creation...e.g. Alien Chest-burster, Face-Hugger of Geiger's design, original Alien ship as female orifice being violated, etc.Even the theme of human-bestiality e.g. Beauty & the Beast is prevalent.

244,incurableflame,Trash Film - I Love It,6,27 May 2021,"This movie had soooooo much potential, so many amazing concepts, but the tone was all over the place; the editing is literally comedic and worst I've ever seen, the dialogue is awkward af. Still, I really enjoyed watching it, it's really weird and messed up and funny and cute and cool - in short, my kind of weird. This could be such a good horror/drama, but somehow it's more like a messed up comedy about two dumb scientists (if that's even possible) who become ""adoptive parents"" to a humanoid hybrid they secretly spliced with active ""junk DNA"" who grows rapidly. Even the name they give her is dumb, Dren, which is Nerd reversed (apparently the company the scientists work for?).On a more serious note, the aesthetics, design, cinematography etc. Are on point, I loved the vibe, especially the claustrophobic lab feeling in the first half of the film. The opening credits are actually my favourite of any movie I've ever seen, very unique, triggers subconscious memories of being in utero. The beginning was extremely promising, until the spliced creature starts wearing human clothes and looking like a mutated toddler - it goes downhill from there. CGI is a bit clunky, but adds to the experience as far as comedy is concerned, and looks cool (sometimes). The motivations and psychology of Dren stay as a total mystery; she wants to kill people/animals just as much as she wants to connect to them and love them, which finally results in a kind of violent parasitic impulse with sexual undertones, which was actually kind of interesting. Otherwise it's a completely chaotic and unpredictable entity.I HATED the female scientist, she was extremely irrational, emotionally stunted and not right in the head. It was unbelievable. The man I was a bit more sympathetic towards, but that might just be Adrien Brody doing so well with such a bizarre role. Though the two characters were meant to be a couple, they acted more like siblings or friends (with benefits). There was way more connection between Brody's character and Dren, both the romantic and sexual elements. I have to emphasize how weird it was though, especially considering the scientist witnessed the birth and formation of Dren and tried to kill her several times, so I mean. You know. But it's implied his character has a telepathic connection to Dren and is far more intune with her than the female scientist.The soundtrack was very forgettable, generic instrumentals. It could have used some deep drone/humming or something. This kind of film is just begging for an unusual soundtrack, to match the sound effects and the strange noises Dren makes.I want to make a compilation video of all the funny/awkward scenes in the film because it's literally 90% of its content. I can't tell you how many times I yelled ""WHAT THE F**CK"", it's at least every few minutes. If you love bizarre awkward stuff, you'll like this. If you're looking for something genuinely disturbing with some psychological depth or if you're an actual scientist yourself, I think it will disappoint you or even enrage you. None of the questions are answered and no mysteries are solved and I bet nothing is scientifically accurate or logical. Just a sci-fi film about a psychologically traumatized woman with mommy issues and an overworked indecisive emotionally confused man who play Go- I mean Frankenstein.TLDR; Ridiculous, poorly edited & written film, but pretty damn entertaining. I'll give it a generous 6/10 for purely subjective reasons (as almost all of my ratings are). Objectively? It would be a harsh 3/10.",Splice

I came  in expecting a series of cheap jump scares, maybe a few bits of gore  and a good afternoon wasted. As the film progressed I realized that  what I was getting had the potential to be something so much more. As  the plot progressed I was treated to what seemed like a modern  retelling of Frankenstein with what could have been an interesting  commentary on genetic engineering and the idea of creating life.  Eventually the movie became little more than modern day grindhouse  theater.  The first half of this movie was great! The issues of would be  parenting, Adrian Brody's character's reluctance to accept the creature  as anything but an experiment and the behavior of the creature itself  all contributed to something that could incorporate horror themes I  haven't seen since Rosemary's Baby. And then Dren (the creature) kills  a cat. This scene could have gone three ways. It could have been taken  as a means of introducing the creature as an amoral monster leading to  a gradual build dealing with themes of the human soul but incorporating  a creepy acceptance and protection by the parental figures, It could  have been used to start showing the creature to have a soul and turn  the two scientist into antagonistic monsters, or it could be the signal  for the film to go to S$%T and result in the creature seducing Adrian  Brody and eventually change its gender and rape it's mother.  I mean, seriously, did 4can write this film? You have two nerds in  love, rape and incest with a humanoid monster, violence that does  nothing but try to bother armatures to the genre and an ending full of  senseless monster on human murders that plays out like a bad  fan-fiction. By the end of the film and Dren starts a killing and  raping spree the film effectively undoes everything it had going for it  and closes on a climax nonsensical to the rest of the move.  I can see how some would like this film, but in the end, it wasn't for  me.",Splice
246,chrome_spokes,Enough of the immaturity,7,19 June 2010,"I love pseudo-intellectuals. I really do. They make me feel that much smarter. ""Splice"" probes the darker elements of the human experience. It's rated ""R."" Big fat hint there! It's not a Disney Pixar animated feature about cars or toys or talking animals. The film explores issues in Freudian psychology, recombinant DNA research, Greek mythology, existential quandaries posed by Mary Shelley in her book ""Frankenstein"" or ""Prometheus Unbound."" Yes, ""Frankenstein"" was a celebrated book from the early 19th century before it was a movie with Boris Karloff! If ""Splice"" disturbed you then it did what is was SUPPOSED to do, because it is a dark cautionary tale about the horrors of science gone awry and the foibles of human nature. Honestly, what did people expect from an ""R-rated"" (God, I really can't stress it enough) science fiction movie? Dancing robots? Leprechauns? Smurfs? An uplifting, life-affirming ending? A freaking musical? A ticker tape parade? Ballerinas? Power Rangers? Look at the MPAA rating, look at the movie poster, use your common sense... Jeez Louise...",Splice

There is no wonder, beauty or romance in this film. No artistic beauty. It all comes down to a hideous experiment with human DNA, creating a creature that has some problems. I don't like films with rape scenes or deranged sex with mutants. I like films that toy with interesting themes of beauty, or justice, or human soul. This did nothing for me and the few people I watched it with we all found it disturbing and unpleasant. This could have been a much better balanced film with some artistic and nice themes instead of exploring the darkest parts of humanity.",Splice

Every single thing that was supposed to look like science was grotesquely, absurdly wrong and unrealistic. What makes a SciFi a good SciFi is the realism, the possibility of the storyline to actually happen. This nonsense is a pain to watch. Get a scientist to read your scripts, it won't cost you more than what you spend on 1 minute of CGI. In case you don't know much about biology the stuff they show in the ""science"" scenes is like observing galaxy rotations in real time with theatrical binoculars.

A couple good things about this movie are the acting (more mediocre) and the special effects.Please don't see this movie out of curiosity.

Even Mr. Brody can't save the day here. The beginning feels very rushed, the middle is just plain funny, and the end.....just made me happy it was over. I gave it 2/10 because the premise is cool.

252,anuragr,an awful splice,3,20 June 2010,"Genetic Engineering and human cloning could be the most debated issues of our times. It is easy to find at least one movie every year which tries to say something new on the topic. Last year I was not only amazed when I watched Moon but suddenly felt more sensitive and informed about the issue.Unfortunately Splice wasn't remotely capable of doing anything like that. If it was at least entertaining I would not have regretted the few hours I wasted watching it. Much as I have liked Adrien Brody I hate to say that there is really nothing I can recommend this movie for. Occasionally you might find some scenes funny, which were not intended to produce laughter, but that is the natural response to a long, meaningless and boring sequence of chasing lesser known artificial animals. The movie is neither a science-fiction (almost nothing is plausible) nor a horror movie as some might think. If it was made and marketed like a teen horror sequence (urban legend) or like a cathartic demon-slaying flick it would have probably been worth something, but as it is the movie is neither though-provoking nor entertaining. The story isn't probably as bad, you gotta admit what poor screen-writing can do to a story. The context seemed very interesting at first – two scientists working on production of a new species by tailoring the DNA of other species in order to viably produce some chemicals that otherwise can't be manufactured. There is a lot of pressure to deliver results but nothing comes in between the researchers and their scientific curiosity. The new species are doomed to back-fire but the movie doesn't make any attempts to ask and address the questions on consciousness or genetic tailoring. Instead it unsuccessfully attempts to invoke a kind of fear of beasts of nature that you might have last seen in Anaconda. The debate on genetic engineering is far beyond the scope of fear against nature. Instead of inspecting the human dilemma while tailoring the DNA, or visiting the clash between science and our ideas of consciousness, the movie chose to fuel a kind of fear against nature that is half a century old. Unfortunately that too isn't executed well. As I said, there is nothing I can recommend this movie to anyone for.",Splice
253,AlexCorncobMovieReviews,Second-half killed the movie,3,11 July 2020,"Splice starts out with a strong plot with an idea that could've really been more developed as the film went on. However, this movie slowly moves away from the scientific explorations of these 2 researchers, and goes into a weirder, and, honestly, uncomfortable story about love and emotion.I liked this movie in the beginning, and had it stayed true to itself I would've probably given this movie a 7 or 8/10. The second half of this movie, however, really kills any sort of praise I give to this movie.I am giving this 4 stars because of the decently good first-part of the movie and some decent semblance of a science-fiction drama.I recommend you check out this movie, but I am definitely not going to revisit this anytime soon.",Splice
254,Kritorian,Interesting but poor ending,5,20 November 2010,"First i want to say this is NOT a horror movie. It's a sci-fi drama that tries fairly well also to be a thriller. Without getting really scary in my opinion. But that's fine because it's not supposed to be. Or is it?It starts out really well. Brody and Polley are both great and everything builds up nicely. The story is clever enough to inspire questions about cloning, bioscience, patenting. But that quality fades soon enough and sure enough there is a cheesy, boring ending. The movie switches from being a sci-fi drama thriller to being just a thriller (or horror?) but fails and simply destroys the good buildup.It manages so well to be a good and interesting drama the first hour and 25 minutes that its hard to forgive the turn it takes near the end.There are many good things about this movie. The CGI is good and following Dren from her birth and throughout the movie is interesting although also seems a bit distanced. Brody, as already said, is excellent and probably what i will remember best from this movie. All in all it's definitely worth a watch but also one that will be soon forgotten. Unfortunately.",Splice
255,byanoski,Unbelievably Terrible,1,5 June 2010,"I am stunned that so many people on here are giving this high reviews. I assumed of all sites this one would give what this movie truly deserves...a 1/10.I went into this movie with no expectations. A few friends of mine were going to see it so I tagged along. I hadn't heard anything about it except that it was something about genetic engineering, which intrigued me as I am interested in the advancement of genetic engineering.I will start off by saying that this movie is very predictable. As an independent filmmaker myself, I could already picture how they were going to open up the movie by just watching the intro credits. It opened with a first person view of something looking up at a group of doctors. What used to be a great first shot is something that is way overdone.Now when I saw that Adrien Brody was in the movie I was pretty excited because I have always respected him as an actor (until this film). He played a scientist with what seemed to be his girlfriend (maybe his wife, they never established whether or not they were married). They worked together in the lab to develop these ""spliced"" blobs that could be used for medical miracles in science...artificial proteins created from animal DNA.They then decided to risk it all by splicing animal with human DNA. This created this animal/human hybrid that grew at a rapid pace, had lungs that could breathe underwater and could even fly. It also had a tail with this pointy thing at the end of it. Quite a complex combination of who knows what. This was another drawback...the ""girl"" just didn't make sense. She was part human and part like 3-4 different kinds of animals.The idea was great but it fell way short. The dialogue in many areas was pretty awful with the most generic lines ever seen in a movie. For example, as predicted the brother of Brody and their boss shows up and the brother steps out and says something like ""I had no choice"". I saw this scene coming the moment the brother found they had a human/animal.There was even a scene after Brody did something that took him from being a great actor to being a nobody in my book because anyone that would accept a scene like this has got to be out of their mind. I will commend them for this scene because half the audience turned their heads in disgust and the other half burst out laughing about how absurd it was. From then on the movie was nothing but a huge laugh. The whole theater was laughing...it went from a sci fi thriller to a comedy pretty quickly.Probably the best part was the ending...because it was finally over. Overall I would tell everyone to wait for this movie on DVD because it isn't worth your money in the theaters unless you want to watch a comedy. It had a ton of potential but wasn't presented in a believable way.I did however enjoy the opening credits...they were very well done. It' a shame the rest of the movie could not have been the same caliber as the opening credits.",Splice

If you didn't appreciate it for the imagination even if it was audacious, then at least admit- the shots and special effects were really really good.I think it would have been better if it had ended before monster resurrection and if the main characters had regretted all their decisions and lost the purpose of their initial research, but oh well.

I give it a two because at least Adrian Brody was in it. The acting was not that bad, though I did find the girl to be really annoying.

The characters were unrelatable and the situation is unreal. Even to a layman, it's clear that the writer did not even consulted a scientist as the premise and the scientific references were very inaccurate - even if it's suppose to occur in the future (I am a scientific researcher by trade so please message me for details if desired). Please do forgo this movie if you prefer movies that are well written.The acting was also subpar. While Adrian Brody's performance was somewhat redeemable, Sarah Polley's character actually command the audience to cringe at her every on-screen appearance. With such shoddy directions, it is difficult to tell the writer actually intended this to occur.Finally, it seems like the writer and director are aware of my previous critiques; because there is really no justification for the gratuitously uncomfortable sexual scenes except that it is the only thing that might create buzz about the film.As a Canadian, I am embarrassed by this film and if I could give it 1/2 stars, I would.",Splice
262,chrart,The common phobias,4,18 June 2011,"It's an average film that picks up on the anxieties of today -- uncontrolled women and transgenderism. Sadly, when privilege is based on physiology, any kind of sex/gender transgression is seen as a threat and has to either be ridiculed (a la frequent jokes in 'How I Met Your Mother') or demonized, like in this movie. The movie shows that if you think a female monster is already hard to control, threatening to kill you at any time with her phallic tail, the female that is allowed to become male will be even more ferocious -- i.e., where the female seduces, the female-turned-male rapes (women) and, furthermore, kills all other males, hinting at the fear that when you allow women to be more like men, they will do away with the original men. The bigotry leads all the way to the end when the offspring parented by two women can't be anything else but monstrous -- as it is framed in the final scene. It's sad to see such blatant homo-, trans- and female-phobia being produced in Canada. If anything, the existence of this movie itself is scary in its extent of bigotry.What the movie does well is keeping the viewer invested in the story until the end. As much as we disliked it, none of us wanted to turn it off until it was over, hoping that things might turn out better than we feared. The film had some good scary moments and the plot was carried forward by a healthy dose of emotion. Annoying, on top of the criticism above, were the stupid decisions these 'scientists' kept making.",Splice

They never even tried to explain why all the female creatures they created turned into males. The sex scene between Dren and Clive didn't bother me one bit, but the rape scene at the end was crude and tasteless and, as far as I can tell, pointless. So, yeah, overall the movie was good, as long as you ignore the poorly thought out ending. Also it was kind of predictable that Dren was going to turn 'bad' and then be killed. A real plot twist in this case would've involved her NOT turning bad. The movie has great graphics and a very interesting concept that could've definitely taken it somewhere.

There was not a moment I felt connected to any of the characters in the film. Over and over and over again they do stupid things, and yet they're supposed to be brilliant scientists. The creature ""dies"" over and over again in the film and then each time transforms into an even more bad ass creature. But these ""scientists"" never take note of this. The creature dies and they bury it...don't even think of burning this horror. Needless to say, that's not the last we see of this thing. They work in a high tech lab with no security, and seemingly so much extra space that they can set up shop in a huge area and no one at all will find their secret set up.Then there is the sex scene...I'm not going to get into it here, let's just say it's not only just so wrong that anyone besides a brainless sex addict would have found themselves involved in it, but it's not needed and so cheapens the characters, the story, and ultimately the film that whoever thought it was a good idea should be locked away in movie jail for many years to come. Don't read this and think it's hot and sexy...it's just stupid and can only be the product of that high school writer I mentioned earlier.Outside of the three main characters, everyone seems like they were literally after thoughts in the screenplay...and in the casting process. I don't know who those other actors were, but if they were any more stiff I would have thought they were part of the set decoration.This reminded me of The Fly 2, and that was bad, but it was far superior to this genetic disaster.",Splice

The trailer and IMDb have it as a horror/sci-fi film and although there is plenty of sci-fi there is no horror. Instead of horror, we get comedy. There are several scenes where people were just laughing and the overall impression that it left was people laughing at something that was supposed to be something other than a comedy. The premise was very good and interesting especially now that science is advancing so fast but eventually it derailed and the movie got lost. The actors did a decent job but that is all.

266,phryx,Species for modern times,6,9 June 2010,"I watched this movie today at cinema.It's quite easy to summarize the plot itself. Two scientists, very besotted in their jobs, try to create a new ""human"" creature out of human DNA. They already created two, but these were made with animal DNA and resemble more some monster than an animal. In fact the use of human DNA was denied by the concern administrators, but the two scientists are allowed to work most of the time for their own so they're able to hide the creature they brought into being.The movie itself has a quite nice modern look with typical SFX effects, which are used in these days. The plot is easy, has some twists but is not that big thing. Especially the ending is hunting one cliché after the other. The acting is quit standard good. Brody (Scientist #1) had his better films, Poller (His wife and scientist #2) not. The whole action reminds me too often to other typical Sci-Fi films of this genre like Alien, Species or Predator. At which Species comes Splice the nearest. My buddy who watched the movie with me made also an interesting suggestion, that the story reminds him of what can be read about Mew and Mewto in the Pokemon game (For those who played it a while, maybe know what I mean).To put it all in a nutshell.

I am a huge fan of sci-fi and horror films and this piqued my interest like most films of this nature do. However, I was shocked during this movie, and not in a really good way. The trailers depict this movie as a scary film, where scientists manage to clone a partial human/animal creature who looks scary despite the obviously human characteristics. It was really good until about the forty minute mark, where it gets unbelievably creepy in an uncomfortable sex scene. Almost everyone in the theatre was cringing and covering their eyes and/or laughing at the ridiculousness of it. It definitely shocked me as I was not suspecting such a thing to actually happen. To me, the entire film took on an eery incestuous feel after said scene which I just found a little uncomfortable (could be because I was sitting next to my parents, who knows). I don't think the intent of that scene was to make people laugh and want to leave the theatre. However, I know a ton of people are going to like it. It is VERY different and I loved Adrian Brody in the movie. Sarah was alright as well. I just didn't find their reactions to the situations very ""realistic"" but that's not really the actors' fault....the entire situation wasn't at all realistic. But there are some interesting scenes that are very unique and it definitely was not a boring film in the least.

I'm a big fan of violence in movies, but this movie is perfectly fine without all the excessive blood and gore. It makes you love the few scenes which do have violence. Like the scene where Fred and Ginger kill each other in front of all those people. That scene uses a lot of blood, but it is really the only excessively gory scene in the movie. The one thing I didn't really like about the movie was that the ending could've been stronger. It wasn't necessarily a bad ending, it just didn't live up to the rest of the movie.

One exciting event follows the next one. During the course of the story, the protagonists have to take many decisions, the consequences of which are rarely foreseeable. Also, I could not guess what would happen at the end. After the movie, my friends and I had a long discussion about what was right or wrong about the decisions the protagonists had taken.

Oh well, here goes.Back here this movie was summarized as sort of science horror movie. So I got in expecting much more slash and dice and stuff. Plus there for Splice, if you want to see a scientific blood fest, you're at the wrong place for this one.I watched this movie together with a friend of mine who studies bio-medical. He recognized a lot of the stuff and terms used in the beginning of the movie, he told me it was very accurate with what you could find in real life now these days, which actually surprised me and even shocked me a bit. It seems ""Splice"" is more realistic then I thought at first. The subject it self is very catching i.m.o. I don't want to spoil anything here, but especially in the beginning, the movie succeeds in dragging you in and keeping your attention, constantly have you wondering what will happen next. But eventually it kind of hits a bump somewhere, and I caught myself looking at how long the movie was going to take, wondering if anything would happen anytime soon. But just when I was getting a bit bored, there was a new twist and it got my attention again. Best part of it is that the makers succeed in creating something that gets you emotional attached. But here is also a snag. You really feel something for the main characters, but the movie constantly places them in a new context and suddenly changing their behavior and role. This happens more and more towards the end, kind of creating an emotional roller coaster, leaving you doubting what you should think or feel when the movie ends.And there's the big negative on this one. The makers build op quite a story, believable characters, but after 3/4th of the movie, decide that it should end, and start rushing stuff (maybe they were running out of tape?). I hope I'm not SPOILING anything here but I don't really know how else to put this (which explains me tagging the ""Contains spoiler"" option). Near the end, it changes from a decent, believable, scientific drama to a more casual horror type of movie. And it kind of fails at that. It even becomes predictable. The last, say 20 minutes, manage to almost ruin the rest of the movie. This goes for the storyline, but for the creature as well.The creature is very nicely done. The evolution is spot on, and it messes with you, since it looks so real and familiar, yet so strange. Almost like a spider; we all know what it is, yet the image doesn't really fit inside our head. But as said, the end also manages to ruin this part. It made me feel sad which way it evolved. It went from something special and unique to something we have seen so often. A shame really, and not deserving for something so nicely thought off and worked out during the rest of the film. Decent is the word you're looking for when it comes to this movie. It even has some very good scenes that will stick for a while. The acting is, again, decent. At points very believable and really dragging you in, but sometimes the characters suddenly act in the complete opposite direction as what you expect, almost as opposite as black and white. Side note for the music; splendid! Not to complicated, but especially the piano parts manages to really ad up to the specific scenes. But it's the ending that brings down the score for this one, which is a shame for the rest of it.",Splice

277,fifthstreetman,Annoying Creature and lead characters..,2,5 June 2010,"This is really one of the worst horror/science fiction movies I've seen in a long time. This seems like a film created by a committee of agents. ""Hey, let's take this part from 'The Fly', and this part from 'Frankenstein', and then we'll add a little of 'Aliens'... you get the picture. SPLICE is the perfect name for this film since it 'borrows' and outright steals from so many other films. Let's start with the poster itself: When was the last time you saw a film company reveal the 'monster' ON THE POSTER!! Film-making 101: Part of the fun of a horror/science fiction flick is the big reveal of the creature. Secondly, the creature itself is just plain annoying with it's stupid squeaks and'cutesy' puppy dog looks. I had no sympathy for the thing and SPOILER ALERT-- couldn't wait until the damn thing had it's head smashed in with a rock. And the casting is terrible. Who is Sarah Polley screwing? I have no idea who thought she should be the star of a movie. She has absolutely no screen presence. And Adrien Brody is equally miscast. The two have no chemistry whatsoever. Polley looks like she's about to crack up laughing at any given moment. Their characters were completely unsympathetic and you really don't care about their story, or what ultimately happens to them. So, basically you've got two annoying lead character and an annoying creature. Two hours of suffering, let me tell you. Stay away from this movie. My friends told me ""it looked stupid"" - and I went opening night, determined to prove them wrong. What a mistake. Just a rehashed, predictable, crappy movie.",Splice

Vincenzo Natali (Cube, Cypher) is great director, but script always feels like something from B-Movie. Shots are always look wonderful, but there is never message behind them. It's good to look at this movie, but there are too much plot holes and clichés to really love this movie. Seriously why would somebody named science lab NERD? And why Dren changed gender for last 10 minutes? I really like drowning scene in lab. (well shot, with great emotions) and scene where we first meet a Dren. I didn't like a soundtrack, it seems to me i heard it a lot of times before. It feels so stereotypical. I enjoyed movie, but I don't have any idea why i should want to see it again.",Splice

All the movie is a kinda character development story, even though its hard to follow sometimes as the characters switch their personality to fit the wanna be fast paced movie.

285,billie_wongt4,A solid new movie about a tired (and almost overdone) ethical topic,7,13 May 2010,"I was privileged enough to catch a screening of Splice last night that headlined the director Vincenzo Natali as a special guest. I've been a moderate fan of his work since his eerie and claustrophobic feature, Cube. Like Cube, I found that this movie was able to set an atmosphere that was almost palatable throughout the film. The main characters, Elsa and Clive (played by Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody, respectively) were both likable and detestable, and yet all the time believable throughout the film. I credit Natali's writing with this emotional tug-of-war, because he was able to explain the motives of the characters without giving too much away and forcing the pacing to lag. (The man is whip smart, and it showed through his handling of the Q&A session after the movie). They do some despicable things, but Natali oft times tries to explain the character's background to justify certain actions. I appreciate the effort, but at the same time, I felt the film required some serious suspension of disbelief on the part of its viewers to really swallow some scenes and resulting relationships.After seeing the movie, you'll probably realize you've seen this movie and premise before. Without giving too much away, this tale reminds me a lot of Jurassic Park. The overarching narrative parallels the sentiments of Dr. Malcom from Jurassic Park (""but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. ""). The character's themselves were even named after pivotal actors in Bride of Frankenstein (Colin Clive and Elsa Lanchester), an homage to one of the great creatures of Science Fiction films, and a source of inspiration to the director himself. The hybrid starts off looking quite alien, but evolves into looking quite human-like (probably due to budget constraints, as well as done to help the viewer identify and empathize with the creature) with legs immediately reminding me of the aliens from The Arrival (1996). Throughout the film, you could see the evolution of all the characters that contributed to the final climax of the film. Elsa and Clive make a lot of mistakes and poor judgments throughout the film considering how 'brilliant' these scientists were supposed to be. They try to approach the creation of this hybrid being with an objective mind - purely for the sake of science. However, in turn, they make a lot of 'human' errors along the way where their emotions come into play. As Chaos Theory explains, small variations in initial conditions renders long-term predictions impossible. The movie keeps you guessing throughout. It evolves in an uncontrolled way, just like the hybrid the scientists created. Like every other creature feature flick before it (Frankenstein, Jurassic Park and even Species), everything culminates into a final climactic scene where the makers are forced to atone for their actions.The creature effects were solid and the actress playing Dren is amazingly beautiful and exotic looking. Her mild androgyny was perfect for the role. Her sharp movements seemed quite alien to me and she took the creature further than what special effects could have done alone. Brody and Polley were both solid actors throughout the film. I particularly enjoyed Brody's wardrobe and styling. The pacing of the film started almost magical, like ET, then quickly picked up pace, paralleling the frenetic tension the scientists themselves must have been feeling.It wasn't a perfect movie by any means and it certainly wasn't one of my favourites in recent years, but I enjoyed it. If I had to compare it to his earlier work, Cube, I would have to say that Cube made a much more lasting impression (I own it and recommend it to friends often). This movie is a fun way to spend an evening. You'll come out of the theatre with a positive experience, but it probably won't be a movie you'd rush out to see a second time.7/10",Splice

Sarah Polley was the most pathetic actress in a horror movie I have ever seen with two scenes in particular that were so horrible I almost left the theater twice. Her shaking in the beginning was so phony it was beyond pathetic to watch and then her overacting throughout the whole movie had me questioning the casting director's sanity.

294,metabogy,"Good halfway through, disturbing in a good way.",7,10 September 2010,"As a big fan of Vincenzo Natali I really could not wait for this movie to come out. Natali has made a series of somewhat low budget but cerebral and brilliant movies that have always managed to surprise me, especially from an aesthetic point of view. Natali has a passion for shapes and patterns, and it shows. In a lot of his movies, a city is a repetitive grid of simple shapes, like a monolithic machine. His representation of a mental prison in Cube is marked by patterns and the repetition of form. In the movie Nothing, he made a pass at shapelessness and absence.Unfortunately, Splice, a collaboration with Guillermo del Toro loses some of that aesthetic quality, which is replaced with a more traditional Hollywood style. There is a distinct biological, David Cronenberg inspiration and theme throughout the film, and it often becomes disturbing.The movie deals with somewhat sensitive (and potentially offensive) themes that haven't really been addressed in a lot of movies, such as inter-species intercourse, rape and breeding. It deals with the subject of hermaphroditic human life and gender identity. It is definitely bound to offend audiences used to every day Hollywood blockbusters.The movie, unfortunately, while being an intellectual and stimulating experience about half way through, it takes a turn for the worse towards the end. This change doesn't completely ruin the movie, as it redeems itself in it's conclusion, but don't expect to leave the theater undisturbed. It doesn't have a happy ending.It gets a 7 from me.

Why do the two main characters give up on the scientific method so quickly? Where do their questionable motivations originate? The characters don't even react to situations in a way you would expect someone to. Maybe this would be understandable if there were some character development to explain it, but there is almost no back story at all.All of this could have been forgivable if there was some intelligent commentary on the risks of genetic manipulation, but this is also absent from the third-rate script.

The whole atmosphere and situation of the inhuman child, which we see from an inhuman fetal stage all the way through to full adulthood, is nail-bitingly gripping. The effects and creature design are among the very best I have ever seen, and the combination of the animal and the human suggests deformity and aberration in a way that makes the viewer uncomfortable, which I think is the point.

Granted, what I expected going in was your typical ""Frankenstein creation gets lose and wreaks havoc across the countryside"" cliché, and instead got an hour and a half of missed political points and social statements.

306,erdoc2803,Captures scientific pressure and ambition,9,23 January 2010,"""I began to think about this when I saw a picture of a mouse with a human ear growing on its back,"" Vincenzo Natali said at the premiere screening of ""Splice"" at the Sundance Film Festival.I knew this film had hit home with me for a reason. Chuck Vacanti, who had developed the mouse ear, is a friend of the family from my father's years as a pediatrics resident in Vermont. I've tracked his career from a distance, and have somewhat followed in his footsteps now as a medical scientist and physician.The truly fascinating aspect of ""Splice,"" then, was that, yes, it had the creation/monster component, which carried a certain novelty and uniqueness. But the real accomplishment of Natali, Polley, and Brody in this film was to capture the ambition of science without falling too much into the caricatures which often result from these attempts.As I watched the film, I thought to my first year in a medical faculty position. A scientist feels a certain pressure to discover and to publish. My experience has certainly not been on the level which these scientists felt, but it has had its similarities. This pressure to discover and create may result something of a ""fight or flight"" response in the scientist. Most of us choose to fight, and that fight means injecting a personal stake into the work one does, even to the point of bending the rules, perhaps, to make things happen. I think it happens to all of us to one degree or another. It may be as small as overlooking the necessary IRB paperwork for all researchers involved in a study. Or it may be as large as injected one's own DNA into a genetic hybrid. We all take risks in science, willing to fight against time, budgetary constraints, and supervisors and inject our own personal stake into our work to see a project come to fruition.In that sense, then, I found ""Splice"" a fascinating film. I don't want to imply an immorality on the part of scientists which even approaches the portrayal in the film. Like the film's characters, however, all of us work under significant pressure with limited budgets. We want success, and our livelihoods and reputations depend on that success. To what degree we are willing to go to achieve that success is a measure which government may attempt to regulate, but is, in large part, a scientist's own moral responsibility. ""Splice"" and the characters portrayed by Polley and Brody capture the dilemma which all scientists face, and the ensuing attempts to find merit and redeeming qualities in the results when rules are broken to achieve certain ends.",Splice
307,ruthmari-1,These guys should go on Jerry Springer,1,5 August 2010,"First of all, let me say - WORST movie I have EVER seen. Worse than Rush Hour 3. Worse than Halloween 6. Worse than Friday the 13th Part 10.The movie did have one thing going for it - the credits were really good. Ummm....and... never mind.Empire reviews gave it 4 stars. What's that stink? I smell a fat pay out from the Splice marketing team....Many people might think the worse thing about this movie was the fact that Adrian Brody shagged a man-made part kangaroo, part plant, part bat, part bald, amphibious woman with a tale that looks like a skinny little penis and bore a slight resemblance to Annie Lennox.HOWEVER this is not the case - The worst thing about this movie was definitely the acting. The dialogue was DIABOLICAL and resembled something written by a bunch of 15 year olds for their GCSE drama prac. In particular the lead female was the poorest actress I've seen in the last... well... possibly ever.I wanted to leave half way through but my boyfriend made me sit it out. Shouldn't have bothered. The whole plot is SO predictable. When the woman caught Brody with his pants down getting jiggy with his synthetically created genetically modified surrogate daughter, the whole cinema literally erupted with laughter and groans. Not the effect I think was intended. The audience pretty much sniggered the whole way through come to think of it, even in the supposedly tense and serious bits.The only thing that remotely entertained me (briefly might I add) was imagining the 3 of them going on Jerry Springer....""See the thing is Jerry, my boyfriend had an affair with my bat/kangaroo/lizard/humanoid daughter.""

The previews for this movie give off the impression of a scary dive into unknown taboo territory. Instead you get a very slow paced, psychological ride into ethics and human nature. Some parts of this movie will make you cringe in disgust and others will make you frustrated at the characters almost one dimensional personalities. The only good things I can see about this movie are the cinematography, music, and true to form broken characters. Do not waste your time as I did.

The script just is not clever, the movie never takes you by surprise. Splice is pretty annoying to watch and I was really this close to leave the auditorium. Had only I known it wasn't gonna get any better I definitely would have. I can't find a single thing that was good about it, there is poor acting, bad lines and everything else what makes a bad b-movie a bad b-movie. It's not bad enough to be funny, either.

In fact, he turned my stomach over easy, just the way I like it. There are at least ten scenes that still have me in knots, both physically and mentally. This is not a movie for the squeamish or the weak. It will affect you strongly for days.Splice dares to be brutally honest about the real terror found in the human experience, and the decisions that dig deep emotional scars.

I couldn't have been more surprised at how much better these characters were developed (Natasha Henstrige was smokin hot though...lol). When Brody was having sex with Dren I kept thinking that although this creature had human DNA, this was still an animal! My dog is cute, but I have never thought about screwing it. Monkeys have near human DNA, but if I put lipstick on it, and teach it how to dance I am not going to bend it over the dining room table. In the case of the Polley character, she was raped...by her son.

312,JaykobStorey,You will remember this movie,8,16 February 2011,"Canadian cinema is rarely good, let alone great. Of course many great Hollywood films owe their scenery to the Great White North that some of us call their home, and a great many big name Hollywood actors, and directors are Canadian bred. Unfortunately films that actually hail from Canada often suck (Defendor and Gunless are two fairly recent, and delightful exceptions) but this Canadian film from director Vincenzo Natali is truly amazing. Don't believe the trailers this is not your standard horror movie, this is a smart, thoughtful, and very emotional movie that explores issues of science, society, and humanity. I wish I could give it a ten because of how much of an impression it had on me, however that feels almost too generous. Yes it's missing something, that little touch of perfection that takes a great movie and makes it one of the greatest movies. Nonetheless I urge you all to rent this film, you will not regret it.The movie stars Adrian Brody, Sarah Polley and Delphine Chanéac, three actors that truly carry the film. Chanéac however is the true star, as she portrays the scientific experiment named Dren throughout the film, as probably the most sympathetic monster of all time. Chanéac is beautiful, and as shallow as it sounds it's her good looks that allow the viewers to grow so attached to Dren, and it really humanizes the character. The fact that many people still found her attractive while shaved bald and made up to look like mutant creature speaks volumes about her absolutely gorgeous face. Of course she's not just pretty, she is a fantastic actress, and displays so much emotion through her features, getting essentially no dialogue yet somehow communicating so many complex ideas. Despite being a genetic monster you can't help but look at Dren sometimes and go ""Awwwww!""Brody and Polley portray a pair of young, renowned genetic scientists, Clive and Elsa, professional and romantic partners. The movie revolves around the two and their experiments with gene splicing, and early attempts to harness tissue for a medicinal wonder but the plot quickly shies away from this when Elsa decides to mix in human DNA. Without giving too much away I'll give you an idea of where the movie goes from there. The experiment ends up growing and the two take care of it in secret, at first for scientific reasons, but it becomes quite clear they have a more personal interest in the result.The film is definitely a horror movie, with some very disturbing scenes, and one that I, nor anyone else who watched this movie will be able to forget (You'll know which one in particular when you watch the film), but the movie doesn't rely on them to be scary, and uses true terror techniques to keep you tightly gripped. It's such an emotional movie, I cannot stress that enough, even non-horror fans should see ""Splice"" because it has so much more to offer than just fear. I couldn't help but be reminded of the Alien films. Ignoring the fact that the creature in Alien had human DNA as an obvious connection, it's Spliced's depraved sexual imagery that truly mirrors Alien. So sit down, turn off the lights, and watch this movie.",Splice
313,wjrmonkey,This is an art film in disguise,8,6 June 2010,"I went to see the film yesterday because the creature looks interesting in the trailers. Also I work in the health care industry, so it's fun to see how the Hollywood perceives biotech researches. But MAN, this film is hilarious! I remember there are two scenes the audience could not stop laughing. AS others have said, this film is really a comedy/drama type of thing. Should've brought girlfriend to see it...... I also want to mention that in addition, I think down in the bone this is an art film - there is an iconic image in the movie that will make this movie remembered for decades. I wouldn't spoil it for you, but as later I read an interview with the director online, THAT image is the sole reason he started the film. Also, just a hint, people mention the analogy to Jurassic Park (1993) for a very good reason, and this film is not so much kin to The Species, which is much dull and banal in comparison. I had a wonderful time indeed, did not regret seeing it. DREN is replacing Neytiri in my dreams now.",Splice

It is dark and disturbing at times but I would file it under Sci Fi Suspense.It is kind of like a new age 'Frankenstein' mixed with 'Rosemary's Baby'. The actress who plays Dren is amazing in that she conveys all the emotional depth of the character with no dialogue. It could have easily left the character seeming flat or one dimensional. It could also have gone the other way and come off 'over the top' and cheezy.This is NOT a 'sneak the children in with you' movie. Leave them at home on this one.I may very well buy it when it comes out on DVD. I think I need a second look.Here is to my sincere hope that they don't wreck it by making a sequel.Kudos to the French company for being brave enough to make it and that Hollywood didn't get it's hands on it.

315,kelvinchecks,Truly bad,4,4 June 2010,"I saw this movie today and I expected it to be bad, but not this bad. My first thought watching this film was how far Adrian Brody's career must have fallen from ""King Kong"" to do this! It was about like watching a Sci-fi channel movie, except with slightly better special effects, and sex scenes and ""F"" bombs thrown in liberally.The creature changed a lot and that was interesting, but it seemed like the director couldn't figure out what he wanted it to be. First it began to breathe underwater - OK - it's amphibious! But then it sprouted wings and could fly. Then it turned into a male from a female. It then had sex with it's ""Mother"" - she previously gave it her human DNA, which was a little like incest. (YUCK!) It was flying around killing grown men left and right at the end. Then the heroine (a petite woman) was able to kill it with a rock. (LOL)",Splice
316,belljar09,"Really, you think this is art?",1,6 June 2010,"I've seen many movies in my short life and this is by far one of the worst. The plot is not good. The woman scientist's ultimate goal with the creature seems to be distorted over the course of the movie. The guy scientist who protested it all along suddenly falls in love with the creature in the last 30 minutes, the movie suggests it is because it has his girlfriends DNA in it, but that really makes no sense at all. I felt there were a lot of holes in the storyline as well probably created from the plot jumping around trying to throw more random information in to make it more ""interesting"" I presume. The ideas behind the movie were decent it conveyed a different possibility as it should being a sci-fi, but they were not very well thought out. I'm not sure why anyone would call this ""art"" though, it is not art it is crap and it wasn't even entertaining at least. If a movie has a horrible story and plot you could at least make it entertaining in other aspects. I'm disappointed in Adrian Brody to be quite honest.

The two scientists are completely reckless and have no sense of responsibility in their work. Their activities went unnoticed (unrealistically) for too long. They seemed to have done no background research as to what would happen, just inventing it up as they went along. What really killed it for me was the classic Hollywood monster plot, the beast being typically invincible and having incredible strength and powers beyond anything they could have imagined (not linked to any obvious traits in the DNA mixture, I might add) and obviously not having any weaknesses. In the end, the plot degraded further and went for 'cheap shots', as if to shock the viewers.

318,woebegoneobscured,This is how a horror movie should be IMO!! Don't look for your political moral/ethic answers here ;),10,2 March 2011,"With no expectations i sat down to watch ""Splice"". I was happily surprised to feel myself caught by this movie. Never got all the creature features, as it seldom seems to keep my attention throughout the movie. Especially if the creature seems uninteresting and too far out to appeal, like the ones in ""Pandorum"", which seemed to me like a dull ""Event Horizon""-y thing, despite an always great Ben Foster. Anyway, Dren in ""Splice"" just felt interesting, and i liked the character-development, especially when portrayed by Delphine Chaneac, who adds a perfect amount of human appearance in the creature to actually make it appealing. Finally a creature that didn't rely fully on CGI all the time to work:) Another thing i liked, was the rather gritty atmosphere in the movie, which suited the movie really fine. Vincenzo Natali really made something that caught me, which is so very rare these days, where good horror movies seems like one in a 10000. For some reason it made me think of the first time i watched Chronenbergs ""The Fly"". The final parts of the movie are somewhat perverted and nasty, but thats exactly what i expect and crave in this kind of genre, so i wouldn't have it any other way ;) CONCLUSION: Don't watch it for scientific and mathematical facts or ethic answers, which seems to distract many people from liking the actual movie. This is a FICTIONAL story, NOT a scientific correct documentary! Just watch it for what it is, a newer enjoyable horror story with the right amount of great acting and effects:)",Splice

321,petewhitaker,What's the worst that can happen?,2,29 March 2013,"Anyone who thinks that this film is going to deal with any of the ethical issues facing science concerning the use of human DNA is going find themselves deluded. The only question asked is in the catch line: what is the worst that can happen? The science of DNA manipulation is not even hinted at; just represented both unimaginatively and unrealistically by a computer display. No long hours in the laboratory attempting to prove an hypothesis by repeatable experiments that validate the results. Instead what we get are bland statements and hard stares from Elsa Kast (Sarah Polley), which she uses to browbeat her partner Clive Nicoli (Adrien Brody) into submission.You can trace a long history almost back to the beginning of cinema of scientists who have attempted one experiment too many when meddling with life; Frankenstein was first filmed in 1910! 'Splice' offers nothing new to the genre and demonstrates that the film-makers have learnt noting new also. The plot is so predictable with no deviation into moral or ethical considerations of the actions being considered. The ending is neither a surprise nor a twist, if you answer the question posed in the catch line then you know exactly what is coming.The acting is unimpressive, Brody is clearly walking through his role thinking about the cheque. Every time his character seems to have a backbone he backs down or just forgets his initial opposition to the next development until of course it is too late. Sarah Polley delivers nothing impressive, just a succession of stern faces followed by smug looks and then outraged glares.The creature itself is somewhat different, but there's no rationalisation as to how it can grow a tail with a poisoned stinger, develop gills, evolve wings and then change gender after apparently being killed. I like monsters, especially in movies, but there has to be some degree of imaginative integrity to them; not just a list of ""gee wouldn't it be great if it could do this"" ideas. Also, if the audience are going to empathise with the creature then it should have some redeeming qualities, Frankenstein's monster was unfortunate, King Kong was kidnapped, Dren was just a mistake taken too far that predictably ended in violent death for almost everyone concerned. Curiously the one person who survived the climax was the one I had the least sympathy for. What's the worst that could happen? I could make the mistake of watching this film again!",Splice
322,Swinub,Wish I could unsee it,4,6 July 2013,"Whilst the film isn't entirely terrible, the idea is interesting, great special effects and good acting from the woman playing the creature; for me it pushed far too many boundaries. It's interesting to see how far people will go to advance science but I felt slightly uncomfortable with how the female protagonist seemed so in love with Dren and well, the sexual scenes were what ruined it for me- I don't understand how one can go from disliking the creature, to being attracted to it. A niggling thing for me was that I never really understood the female lead's background, I don't think it was effectively explained. The film does pose some deep questions about scientific research so I suppose the uncomfortable atmosphere throughout the film is intended.

323,done_holding_back,"Comic book-style sci-fi, unlikable characters.",3,5 June 2010,"With antagonists and protagonists swapping roles like they were at a key party, the film is missing something vital: likable characters. The film tries to venture into moral ambiguity, but spends most of its time muddled in patently bad decisions that get swept under the rug as ""Well, it happened, so we may as well go with it"". The ethical character in any given scene is quite likely to abandon their conviction in the next scene, although we never really understand why.Splice is an ironically appropriate title for a movie that comes off as an awkward splicing together of drama, parody, comedy, social commentary, and good old-fashioned ""monster in the foggy woods at night"" horror. Unfortunately, none of these seemed to mesh particularly well.Many of the elements (major and minor) are predictable. There are certainly a few out-of-left-field curve balls, but again these ultimately don't mean anything for the main story arc and are only valuable on their own merit.While not overly preachy, the commentaries this film makes on topics such as abortion, stem cell research, parenting, and evil companies are very obviously contrived and delivered.Finally, the science element of the film is far too glossed over, ending up neither mysterious nor intriguing, settling instead for just silly. Despite adequate acting, neither of the main scientist characters are believable as professional scientists, leading one to wonder how they succeeded in their career prior to the start of the story. If this were set in an underground bunker at the north pole, and made use of nicknames like ""Dr. Sinister"", it might have fared better as a comic book film.",Splice

326,Tim_Rose,"Great acting, solid effects, slick style. Slightly uninspired execution.",8,15 June 2010,"I had the privilege of seeing Vincenzo Natali's ""Splice"" tonight, and I must say that I went in with average expectations and was left pleasantly surprised. The marketing campaign is way off mark, as it usually is for most films nowadays. Trailers for ""Splice"" leave the impression that a suspense laden gore-fest a la ""Species"" is in order, when in reality there was minimal suspense throughout the film. As a whole, the films functions as a disturbing character driven narrative, with emphasis being put on husband/wife and parent/child relationships. Those looking for the next big horror film need to look elsewhere, as this is more of a science fiction drama/black comedy than anything. The film oozes style throughout, from the slick opening credits to the varied soundtrack and every nuance in between. The film has a defined modern feel, with trendy tech and pop culture references abound, though all the winks and nods to the popular ""Wired"" tech publication got a little tired. It would be a stretch to call ""Splice"" an instant classic, but I feel it will be one of those cult movies in a decade or so, along the lines of ""Re-Animator"" or similar fare (although infinitely more polished than any B-Movie could ever be). There was enough humor in the dialogue and the expressions of the creature to lighten the overall mood of the film, and I even found myself laughing aloud at certain parts (""F***."" ""Exactly.""). Creature effects are very believable, if somewhat dated looking when compared to more recent forays into 3D technology (i.e. Avatar). The plot begins to drag after the start of the second act, and while not delving into the realm of boredom I did find myself waiting for the story to pick up. The third act was predictable and contained an uninspired romp through wintry woods at twilight, and the ending lacked the impact that the opening of the film had, although the possibility for a sequel has been cleverly set into place. This movie was not groundbreaking or thoroughly original, but it was entertaining as far as recent sci-fi goes.

It's a bit slow, but engaging if you enjoy psychological drama.But then, there's the ending, which I'll try to describe without spoiling any actual plot.About twenty minutes before the end, the creators must have remembered they were making a horror movie, and characters and setting completely change into something resembling standard horror movie fare with added sexual wrongness.Splice might have still passed as a B movie with this ending, but the sexual perversion present makes the result revolting and laughable rather than thrilling.

The writing I felt was pretty good, if a tad rushed in spots. I strongly believe this would have done much better if it was longer than an hour 44 minutes. It seemed like the ending was particularly rushed, as she went from a ""curious child"" type to sex-crazed killing machine in a manner of moments. It's a good story and all but act 3 was a mite disappointing. The first act was relatively strong; and the one wherein the issues of human clone research comes into play which I strongly believe it mirrors the real world. Second act was where I first realized I sympathized most with the creature; which I think is actually a good thing. So many times in Hollywood ""monster"" flicks we're meant to completely demonize the creature while sympathizing with the humans, and this was the reverse for me. Third act as I mentioned seemed rushed and it seemed a bit forced on the audience. Won't say too much more so as to not spoil too much.Speaking of the writing, how about the characters? I think the movie did well with this as it toyed around with my emotions. First I felt sorry for Elsa; having a shitty childhood and all (I think, they didn't specify but it sounded like that) and wanting a child of her ownand such, and how I thought it was a nice breath of fresh air for someone to treat a ""monster"" as something more human-like instead of some freakish being. In fact it was Clive I hated at first as he seemed like a douchebag. But then at around the midpoint I switched around. Clive was becoming more open to dren and softening up, whilst Elsa was becoming a hardened crazy-ass bitch.Now as for Dren. I believe she was the star of the show, and rightfully so. It's not often that we see an equal balancing between the ""monster"" and the humans, but I felt they did it rather well. Lastly are the effects. Personally I think there's not TOO much to talk about here, as most of the effects were for dren. That being said I felt the CGI and effects were quite good. Dren looked very alien despite being terrestrial, which I thought was a very good thing.All in all, it really DOES fit the description of ""A thinking person's sci-fi"". While the ending may seem slightly disappointing, the rest is good in it's own merit.

Later the 'dad' has sex with the 'daughter' (in a disturbingly pornographic scene). Then, because of some bad science the 'daughter' turns into a male and rapes the 'mom' (in a disgustingly... I hate to even say the word, but.. exotic scene). He then kills the 'dad'. The 'mom' bludgeons the 'son' to death, but stop the presses she ends up pregnant.

This is by far the worst movie I'v seen in years. At some point, I'm sure I've seen another movie this bad, but I can't think of any at the moment.OK, so let's get to the reasons this movie completely sucked.Obviously, this is supposed to be a Sci-Fi thriller, and Character development isn't usually paramount, but The director gives us no reason whatsoever to care about the two main human characters. They're not really good people, they're not really bad, they're just there conducting the most ridiculous experiments which end up giving us the ""Creature"".OK, so the two main characters don't give us anything to care about. No big deal, this is a Thriller right? So we can expect some good old fashioned, edge of your seat, scares right? Wrong. There's nothing remotely scary about this film, aside from the fact that the studio greenlighted it.OK, so, We don't care about the characters... It's not scary.. Maybe it'll have some higher purpose, with great social commentary, and a message of ethics that makes us think. NOPE.The whole premise of the movie is beyond stupid, but by the time Brodie has sex with the Creature, it's completely impossible to take this movie seriously.I usually have no problem suspending disbelief at the movies... But c'mon, Throw us a bone here, you want me to believe that two young, successful, highly educated scientists working in a medical/genetics laboratory, splice one of their own DNA samples with that of.... some other DNA coctail to create a humanoid creature in the broom closet in the basement, of the Med Lab because... Why? who knows. Who Cares.It grows up into a female freakshow, that not even the lonliest guy I know would have sex with, but Brodie decides to do it anyway. Then the Creature changes it's gender, and Rapes the female doctor, knocking her up, and Killing Brodie in the process.Female doctor is pregnant with Freakshow's child, and the movie ends with GREAT possibilities for a FANTASTIC sequel. Somebody slap the Director.If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed that in this day, and age a movie this bad didn't go straight to DVD.I wasted 2 hours of my life, and $1.75 on this steaming heap of crap.

340,afghantrainer4567,Looks great but not exactly a masterpiece,6,13 June 2010,"This movie attempts to push the boundaries of the moral/ethical dilemmas of human genetic experimentation, but falls flat with poor character development and forced plot points.What makes the movie seem forced is that the writer/directer, Natali, does not take any time to build a moral imperative for crossing legal and ethical lines. Within five minutes of the opening credits, his pseudo-emo/punk bio-medical engineers jump into human DNA experimentation just to prove that they can. There is little in the way of introduction to the characters to explain this behavior which in some movies is part of the mystery, but in this case works against it.This movie was supposed to be a horror film, except I thought it was funny. However, I'm not sure that the writers meant the movie to be funny which makes it even funnier.One the plus side, the creature DREN was compelling and intriguing. However, even her development is somewhat contrived and poorly explained.Overall, there are three things to take away from this movie: 1) Hollywood bio-engineers are the dumbest smart people on the planet, 2) bio-engineers shouldn't make genetic freaks with human DNA, and neither should Hollywood, and 3) problems arising from said genetic freaks are most easily cured with a shotgun.This movie presented a great deal of potential for creating a new standard in horror in the tradition of ""Alien"". But by falling short with poor plot development and poor character development, it became more of a freak-fest in the tradition of ""Species"".

341,Bedhead7,Overrated Canadian mess,2,3 November 2010,"Take a cutting edge technology, dumb it down for an audience, introduce some cardboard cutout hipsters that wear edgy t-shirts and army patches sewn on their lab coats. Have them use the cool new technology during a montage set to techno. This is Splice. After the first twenty minutes you can tell the filmmakers are more concerned with style and less concerned with character and story. The opening credits drag. They look like something from 1998. It appears Canadian film makers did not leave the 90's. The laboratory scenes are painfully over saturated and over processed. Think CSI Miami. We are given said montage within the first 20 minutes of the film, before learning anything personal about the characters or their motivations. Comparisons can be made to the movie Hackers or The Lawnmower Man. Same old crap. I am reviewing the visuals of this film because honestly, that is all there is to review. The creature, Dren, changes so much, you don't get attached to or care anything about it. Dren can't be drown, shot, pushed off a ledge, stabbed or burned. That's all I know about her character. It transforms 6 or 7 times and appears to have completely different motivations after each change. I chalk this up to the VFX team and the director trying to show off as many creature designs as possible while not having to write a solid character. The two main human characters seem to act in whatever way servers a particular VFX shot best. They drive a retro car, wear expensive expedition style parkas and live in an ultra modern apartment. That sums up the human characters in Splice. This movie is a vain demo reel made by an ex story board artist turned director. Skip this movie.",Splice

There are few movies i have ever walked out on; few enough that this would be the second. I am one to give movies a chance, give it time to develop... That's what disappointed me so much about this movie. From the beginning, i was able to deduce the general plot twists, nothing unusual, but i enjoyed how the story was playing out! It was developing very strong and looked like it would have a rather promising, twisted ending. Up until it turned into a Sci-Fi Rape-Porno. Sure it was a twist, but come on, we all realized there was going to be a little interest between the two of them but to that graphic extent was too far. The last 30 minutes of the movie before i walked out ruined the whole experience for me. The story was fun, and the thrilling suspenseful moments were well-placed... But i do not want to see again what i saw at the end of that movie. Had not been for the ending i would have given this something more like a 7 or an 8; But as i said.

So, lets go in depth shall we? The acting is good, Adrien Brody does a good job in his role...and that's where I stop with compliments (and no character was really developed all that well. They were nameless caricatures of personalities. Brody ""Scientist with apprehension"" Elsa ""woman scientist willing to do anything to succeed""). The story had way too many holes, that someone with any knowledge of science would be pained to watch. And also, we're supposed to believe that two Biochemists would make the series of stupid decisions that they did, as such, the scripting, and lines become unreasonable quickly. The scenes are basically set in two places, and that becomes boring. A lab, and a shed. The backdrop quickly fades and you are forced to listen to two people stumble in to their own mess, farther and farther. The music, was minimal, which was good, but also had you feeling like something was going to jump out, and it never did. The tension was felt, but was never released. Pair all this, with an ending that is impossible, you get what I just saw.

345,jonulf,"Crappy Science Fiction Movie, Good Comedy",1,9 April 2010,"After looking at the four other reviews for Splice, I had to add my thoughts. I saw this at Sundance back in January with my cousin. One, we are both utter film lovers, not movie goers or typical college kids in their mid-twenties that see the occasional movie. We adore films like The Fall, There Will Be Blood, and many other well made pieces of cinema. We're also complete sci-fi geeks. So we both thought Splice would be a good mixture of both, decent premise, with a knock-out actor (Brody). Unfortunately we were wrong. Splice is nothing but another monster movie that tries to package it under a bio-tech/genetic engineering bit. The movie is full of over-done clichés. In fact, at one point, the two main characters get in an argument, but it doesn't sound like they're arguing over anything, just saying every cliché line in the book. Crappy writing, poor directing and terrible monster idea.With that said, Splice did evoke some very strong emotions from the 300+ people we watched it with, namely humor. At points in the movie which I can only assume the film makers meant to be dramatic or shocking, there were two reactions going on among the audience, the appropriate shock, or gut-wrenching laughter. This movie was so contrived and hard to buy, even for sci-fi, that it went beyond any level of ""bad"" and right into the humorous. Of everything I saw at Sundance this year (like A Prophet, which was actually an amazing movie) I expected this one to NOT get a major release.But don't worry, Splice is getting re-edited, so maybe all the bad parts will get cut, leaving the 'just OK' parts of the film in. Don't be naive, just because I give a movie a bad review, doesn't make this review not helpful. What are you looking for, confirmation that your bad movie taste is actually good? Face it, bad movie making is bad movie making, no matter how much you want to like the movie.",Splice
346,superb_play,Go see it now,8,16 June 2010,"In a lot of ways, Splice is a modern take on Frankenstein, and the movie recombines its own DNA from a vast array of influences. It's hard not to see echoes of David Cronenberg's work, especially since the film is also a Canadian production, but it borrows from more traditional creature features like Species and Mimic as well, and it even has some of the odd light-hearted elements of E.T. and Gremlins mixed in for good measure. In terms of the science, Gattaca comes to mind as a topical connection, but in my head I keep thinking of Splice as this year's Pontypool — albeit with a moderately bigger budget and some well-known stars. I say all of this not to point out that the film is unoriginal (it isn't), but more to prepare you for the wild concoction that you might getting yourself into. This is a creature feature that finds the sweet spot between science-fiction and horror, without ever really allowing itself to get pigeonholed into any specific conventions. It's not a traditional horror movie that goes for a lot of big scares, and instead it chooses to disturb you with imagery that is just a little bit eerie and keep you feeling progressively more uncomfortable. By the end of the film, things do get a lot more sinister and there are a couple of scenes that really push the envelope. I don't doubt that these scenes in particular will paint most people's opinion of the movie (they had the entire theatre gasping in horror and disbelief), but I applaud it for having the balls to go places that no one expected, even if they stretch the limits of believability.Splice is more than simply a cautionary tale about the slippery slope of science, however. It's no accident that the film's two protagonists are a young couple thinking about having a child together. In a pretty obvious sense, Dren becomes their child, and the movie becomes a way to explore the challenges and anxieties of becoming a parent. This theme helps bring about moments that are both humorous and touching, but it also makes what is to come that much more horrifying. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley both do a great job at keeping their characters grounded while working within both a sparse framework and extraordinary circumstances. There is no question in my mind that without their acting talents the potential of this movie would have been squandered.That being said, it is the special effects that are the highlight of this film. We're not talking billion dollar Michael Bay state-of-the-art effects, but rather, a subtle mix of CG and practical work, allowing the creature to come to life in several physical incarnations and to evoke a variety of responses. Dren is played at various stages by human actresses Abigail Chu and Delphine Chanéac, which I think was absolutely essential. It's impressive what Vincenzo Natali was able to do with $26 million, but more importantly, it's also effective. The movie won Best Special Effects at the 2009 Sitges Film Festival, and I'm not surprised.The marketing for Splice seems to be selling it as a fairly straightforward horror movie in the vein of Alien, and I anticipate a fair bit of disappointment from moviegoers who go in hoping for mindless mayhem and carnage. For the rest of us, though, the fact that we're even able to see this movie in theatres is a huge win. There's a part of me that wanted more of a visceral experience from this film as well, but I think in the end what we've got here is something refreshingly unique that manages to stimulate both the conscious and unconscious mind. Regardless of what you think about that last act, Dren is certainly not a creation you'll forget anytime soon, and Splice is one of the weirdest and most delightfully shocking movies of the year.

Why is it in these kinds of films, if the male lead has sex with the 'monster' it's filmed as an erotic seduction but when the female lead has a sexual encounter with the 'monster' it a violent rape. Worse is that the only words Dren says in the film are a vulgar twist on words 'she' spelled out earlier just at the start of the rape. What a crap trap of a film.I fear Aidrian Brody is on his way to joining the list of actors who should have to give the Oscar back.

These two are a great couple, and have great chemistry on screen. But don't get me started with Delphine Chanéac, who plays the creature Dren. She manages to do what Boris Karloff did in the original FRANKENSTEIN, which is convey a range of emotions, without speaking a word. Her facial expressions, and clicking/squeaking sounds she makes were what made the character for me. With the help of some amazing creature effects, Chanéac makes this movie what it is. The plot of the movie doesn't let off either. It was a new and interesting take on the basic Frankenstein story. With clues planted throughout to make you pay attention, and take a guess at what will happen next, the story is fantastic. If I had a favorite part of the movie, it would be the ending. I won't spoil anything, but what I will say is that it left me walking out of the theater going, ""WTF?!"", but in a good way. This movie is spectacular, no wait, Splice-tacular!",Splice

As someone who works in the medical field, I was attracted to seeing this movie for the ethical issues it posed. Splice could have focused on certain moral issues we we are faced with on a daily basis - cloning, disease, and so on. However, there was little focus on these issues and more focus on elements that made moviegoers say ""What the heck?"".The ending was even more of a disappointment. Didn't Elsa learn anything? It seemed like she digressed in her understanding of human nature, and that was a major disappointment.Secondly, this movie started very strong. It quickly faltered after 15 minutes. There was so many unanswered questions in each scene that it was barely believable. I won't go into detail, but its pretty apparent that Natali did not pay attention to certain details that make a good director an excellent director. These minute details would have made a huge difference in believing the story rather then simply just watching the story unfold.Lastly, it simply seemed like there wasn't enough material or ideas to make this movie work.

This creates this odd looking human creature that you expect to just murder everything it sees. Wrong. It is nothing like you expect it to be. By the end of the movie I think it kills like two people and a couple animals. Not the gory movie you expect. Anyway it goes on to live as basically their child and in the end basically gets killed because they didn't know how to control it, go figure.

This is the kind of story that works better in an hour format like an X-files episode. At feature length the story is dragged out...

360,ndolphin1215,Crash and burn from a strong start,2,10 June 2010,"Splice started with a decent level of intrigue and what I thought was a high level of potential. As the movie went on, however, it was obvious that the beginning was the best part. It appeared as if the writer wrote the beginning, died in a horrible accident, and the producers didn't notice until they had to write the rest of the script in one weekend. So let's start with the first problem: There was such little character development, I can't even remember the names of the main characters. I'm not going to spoil one of the parts of the movie, but what should have been a very strong part of the character was only revealed half way through the movie, not by her actions, but through another person's words. Suffice to say, you never feel that she shows this characteristic. It makes sense that she would have it, but the writer didn't do a good job of showing that.Next, the plot has more holes in it than swiss cheese. The two main characters are supposedly geniuses (they have done something in science no one else has been able to), yet they make mistakes any half intelligent human being wouldn't make. I know publishing results is a pretty strong motivator, but I didn't feel that that was their motivation. The ending is predictable, but I don't have a problem with that. I have a problem with it being impossible. When the premise of the movie is science that may at one time exist, an ending that is just not possible is disappointing at best.Thirdly, the only thought provoked by this movie is, ""Why did I pay 11 dollars for this?"" It makes you think of crazy things we can't even do yet. The part about it being part human raises some ethical issues, although they are not developed well/at all. The only parenting advice in the film is parenting advice that only a criminally offensive parent would need.Lastly, the twists in the movie are unnecessary, disgusting, and don't add anything to the movie. On the contrary, I'd say that they retract from it (except for one of them, which I was neutral about).The one redeeming thing I can say about it is it isn't one of those jump-out-at-you horror movies, which I appreciated. It does, however, make all of the characters the most retarded scientists to ever exist, because otherwise the movie would have ended in the first thirty minutes.",Splice

The plot was unoriginal, the characters were shallow and unlikeable, the moral dilemmas were contrived and the ending was totally predictable! This was more like a bad episode of ""The Outer Limits"" with nudity than a full length movie. My advice is save your cash and watch something worth your time and money.",Splice
362,AIChead,Worst Movie In Awhile.,1,13 June 2010,"This was by far one of the worst movies I've viewed in a theatre in awhile. I can't pick out a single scene I enjoyed.I am amused at the posts of people defending the scientific content and that bio-tech is this and that. It's simply a movie. It's not close to reality, so there's no real need to defend it on an intelligent level.The scenes where Elsa were 'teaching' Dren words reminded me of watching scientists teach chimpanzees how to differentiate colors and shapes. The sex scene between Dren and Clive was nothing but humorous and a bore. Couldn't have predicted THAT...whatsoever... ... The ending wasn't predictable either. I never in a million years would have seen that coming.Come on now. The previews gave the impression these two created a horrific monster that killed people out of revenge and anger, and this is what I got in return. Total bust. 0 out of 10.",Splice
363,TheSilverSmile,Uncomfortably Entertaining,8,14 June 2010,"When seeing the previews and trailers for this film, I was put into the mindset of another angle on the ""Species"" films. I had enjoyed those and the concept behind them, so I decided that Splice was another film I'd have to check out.Waiting about a week to see the movie and picking an odd day to see it, I was rewarded with a theatre all to myself and my companion, but it proved to make the experience that much more enjoyable. The movie started out strong and held your attention with a unique intro with the usual companies responsible for helping make the film happen, but they were delivered in a very creative way.From that point on during the first half of the movie there were lots of hooks and great visually stimulating scenes to continue to hold your attention. The acting in the movie was fantastic. The cast was relatively small but each character beyond the 3 central ones were white-washed into a comfortable background. The real star is obviously Dren and the way she relates to her new 'parents'.The plot, for some more observant film-goers, will probably come off as predictable. I, myself, tend to guess how things turn out well in advance and 4 out of 5 of the 'surprises' I was able to guess ahead of time, and the fifth I only half-guessed.There is very little humor in the movie, though some things can give a little chuckle. It's a very somber and thoughtful film that thoroughly entertained. The sexual content is where it can get a little uncomfortable. Physically, the Dren character is not wholly unattractive and can pass for a normal bald-headed woman if not for her legs, tail, and overly large eyes. Visually she is stunning and shocking all in the same and the creators do well to incorporate that into her sexual scenes- dancing the line between tastefully erotic and terrifyingly grotesque.In the end, I found very few similarities between ""Species"" and ""Splice"" and more in common with Michael Crighton's book ""Next"" what with the gene patents and the central plot with the scientist and his ape-human hybrid.In all, I greatly enjoyed the movie and applaud the creators for their ability to twist stimulating cinematography, excellent acting and dialogue, and macabre plot that could very well be a near future in our scientific evolution.",Splice

His acting was fine, but the plot was absurd, the special effects were weak, and the characters were universally shallow and unlikeable. You can't build a movie on a string of scientific principals/clichés (some lifted right from ""Jurassic Park"") and hope it works out. Several members of the audience left in the middle of the movie and, by the end, most people were laughing at some of the clumsy dialog and plot twists. The director took some risks and there were some uncomfortable ""pushing the envelope"" moments (my reaction was ""oh, that's just not right""), and I appreciate both.

The movie starts off very entertaining and then it became a little disturbing (Clive having sex with Dren). Then all of a sudden and without a real motive the creature starts killing people (yeah, it transformed into a male, so what? if it's supposed to have human DNA, it is also supposed to think and to be smart is not it?). At the end the male creature has sex with the Elsa and gets her impregnated. So this creature has a lot in common with humans, but it is incapable of reasoning which does not make a lot of sense to me. Besides that Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley did very good job. Delphine Chanéac/CGI did a good job as well but get used to the fact that you are not going to watch an Oscar nominee movie here. If you can go past this fact, then get some popcorn and be ready to have a laugh and get a little scared at times.",Splice

It was just so laughable, I did think at one point it was a comedy, but no, they were deadly serious. All the actors were unconvincing, the script was such a joke, and nobody on this planet can suspend belief to the degree where any of this drivel would be even the slightest bit plausible. However, all that aside, what on earth was Adrian Brody doing in this less than a B movie film. This guy has won an Oscar for goodness sake. Is this really the best he can find to do? Utter drivel. There was a film called Plan 9 from Outer Space years ago. Compared to Splice, Plan 9 seems like Gone with the Wind. When I came out of the cinema, people were just looking at each other dumbstruck. Toy Story 3 was showing at the same complex, and I feel sure, without exception, that all of us wished we had seen that instead.",Splice

Sometimes you get lucky and see something great, and sometimes... well, you're not so lucky. Unfortunately, this time it was the latter.Splice is promoted as a sci/fi-horror flick and headlined by Academy Award winner Brody. Apparently, good judgment is not required for receiving an Oscar, as this film was probably the worst I've seen in a long time. And I watch a lot of movies. The predictable moves (the element of surprise is one of the key factors in a horror film), the C-grade acting (Brody's fellow cast members) and the ridiculous created lifeforms made this movie more of a gore comedy than a heart pumping angst fest. Let's look at some details (SPOILER ALERT, well, if there's anything that can spoil this movie...).Scientists Brody and Polly (Mr. Nobody, Dawn of the Dead) are investigating a way to create new lifeforms by combining DNA of different animals, and finally, a person. The first two creations in this movie are Fred and Ginger, two fat wormlike creatures with a head like a penis. This phallic theme returns when Dren is created, the 'experiment' with human DNA. When Dren is born, it looks like a guinea pig with turkey legs and a phallic head. Eventually it morphs into a more-or-less human like creature, if it were not for those giant ostrich legs. And foldable dragon wings. And tail with a regrowable stinger. Did I mention the extra set of amphibian lungs? Or the sex change option? The baldness of the entire creature? The creature might be more comical than scary, but the fine people of Splice found a solution for that. I can only wonder what the writers were thinking when they decided to sex it all up and have Dren have sex with BOTH Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley (although the latter wasn't voluntary). Cries of comical disgust filled the air. in the end the thing get's killed but not before an opening is given for a possible sequel: Polly gets knocked up and decides to keep it! 'What's the worst that can happen?' she asks herself in the end. Well my love, the worst that can happen is ANOTHER FILM BASED ON THIS STORY LINE. It should be stopped in every possible way to save mankind.I was planning on writing a long and detailed review of this movie, in fact, I even created an IMDb account for it, but now I decided to wrap it up. This movie is not worth my time. It already took up too much of it last night at the movie theater.

(Contains A LOT of spoilers so please do not read if you have an issue with this) Do not get me wrong, the movie starts OK and the whole complex relationship thing is interesting (setting aside the awful acting and the sudden change of places of the two protagonists. In 5 minutes the man goes from hater of the creature to lover -literally!- and vice versa for the woman). However, up from the point where the whole attraction thing started, it became ridiculous.First of all, it mixed up not one or two but FIVE different genres. Starts up as sci-fi, goes to activist-drama, switches to regular drama, then awkward romance and at the end horror! I have not seen a single movie to play successfully in that many genres. And this one is no exception. Secondly, I found the whole idea of the man being attracted to the creature as gross. I realize the entire ""creator-father"" syndrome that the movie tried to emphasize but seriously... It had to be done in a more covert way. And as for the end, it was just not fitting at all. If the movie had stopped where the creature was buried, OK it would still have been a bad movie but at least it would have remained faithful to what it tried to do. But no, it had to add to the sickness that the audience had already accumulated by showing the female protagonist getting raped by the now-male creature. And to add insult to the injury, the female protagonist gets pregnant, pointing to a sequel in the most blatant way possible.Just horrible.",Splice

Seriously, these words must have gone through the writer's mind before composing this atrocity at least once.Throughout this movie I had to wonder, what is the point of this? Are they saying that gene splicing is only going to create monsters? The recurring theme is that 'some things should just never be done'. Things like leaving the cave. Starting a fire. Inventing a wheel. These things should never be done! Look at the horror that will result! (Fires and cars with wheels KILL PEOPLE) Okay so maybe I'm reading a bit much into what is clearly supposed to be a horror flick. I mean it's not like they did a bit of research before writing this, so I can assume it's just throwaway scares. I could go on for hours about the pseudoscience used in this movie but people would probably be like 'oh you're just projecting realism on a work of fiction. We don't need things like settings to enjoy a movie!' I found myself wondering why not one but two mad scientists were required for this movie. Why couldn't one of these hipster sciencey types put together two brain cells and stop the other from being insane? Love? Depravity? Who knows, it didn't make sense.The fact that the research group is called NERD makes me cringe. Could we have some acronym that's just a little less retarded? Maybe this appeals to the facebook generation, but it's terribly cliché. WE'RE NERDS LOL WE DO SCIENCE AND LISTEN TO HEAVY METAL.The actor playing Dern was talented. I mean zero lines and all you gotta do is twitch like a monkey on cocaine, but aside from that she was pretty and talented.

Deeply disturbing treatment of human experimentation & scientific investigator's bias in an ethical examination genetic's industry research.

In many ways the film addressed Greek tragedy i.e. Oedipal Complex, Shakespearean themes including death of parents at the hands of offspring for supremacy of the bloodline/species. As well, there the Ridley Scott ""Alien"" meta theme regarding the sexuality of consuming & becoming consumed during the act of creation...e.g. Alien Chest-burster, Face-Hugger of Geiger's design, original Alien ship as female orifice being violated, etc. Even the theme of human-bestiality e.g. Beauty & the Beast,is prevalent.

375,vrmilionzx,A terrible movie - but not for the reasons you think.....,1,9 December 2010,"Oh where to begin. This movie has huge potential to be great, then trips over it's own feet and falls way short. Without too many spoilers, let me just say, flipping his emover hair is about the extent of Brody's acting range in this film. I'm willing to bet that he was cast because someone thought his name was pronounced ""broody"" - because for most of the film (when he's not having sex with the bizarre child/creation/experiment/monster, he's whining about how they should kill it (he even tries). Sarah Polley is great as a potentially schizophrenic nut job, but not believable as a scientist. She goes back and forth so fast she probably has whiplash - nurturer to abuser, to straight up insane, to attempting cold calculating science brain again. Oh, and she gets raped by the creation shortly after Broody copulates with it. The rape scene is, in my estimation, her best moment in the film, because she's not overacting, or making you gasp with revulsion at her attempts at a reasonable performance. I have to ask - if you are creating something, you know what goes into it, right? Yeah, they don't. They just take a bunch of genetic material, spin it, and BOOM! Monster that has sex with one creator, changes gender, and rapes another one. There's multiple levels of wrongness in these scenes, aside from rape. Think about this - they created Dren, and effectively chose to raise her as their own child. NOW add the fact that there's some kind of ""other"" genetic material. From animals. So we're talking some kind of incestuous bestiality rape. Involving a minor (based on her ""childlike affectation and youthful innocence""). Pure. Movie. Magic....as only the dumbed down Hollywood can put forth. Some would argue it's a monster movie. I'd argue the real monster is, in fact, the movie.

Without knowledge of Greek mythology the plot will appear predictable and the story will not make much sense. The lab/research premise is only a set up. Those who complain about inaccuracies missed the point, which is what happens when a creature is generated from the mind (like thought, ideas, or the goddess Athena-Nike born from the head of Zeus) of another being instead of being given birth from the womb. Furthermore, in the narration, other myths and mythological figures will be presented to the viewer: Oedipus, Icarus, Hermaphroditus... so if you cannot identify all of these references the movie will definitely fall flat for you.",Splice

I can't forgive myself for having known that it was going to just get worse and worse as the ideas and the script became more and more desperate.What shocks me more than the movie though (especially Adrian Brody's far deteriorated acting ability), is the number of people who review it as a 10 star ""Intelligent"", ""well-acted"" movie, ""definitely worth watching""?! It just makes me scratch my head in the disappointment and realisation that the general movie-viewing public are so mindlessly satisfied (worryingly so!) with anything that the now completely un-original, money-prioritising, quick-buck-making Hollywood(en) throws at their attentive faces??! And whilst I mention Adrian Brody (who I once considered a VERY credible and capable actor), I think it's safe to assume that he has finally guaranteed the end of his 'serious' acting career with 'that' scene in this movie!

Brody really suited the role because of his kinda nerd looking face with a little curious in it and Polley was just the kind of actress who makes you feel what she feels during the movie. I think what the movie is lacking is outdoors. We don't see really much sun or anything during the movie which makes you darken inside a little.

While I rather enjoyed the creature effects, I couldn't suspend disbelief enough to care about the story as a whole.Would that that were the only plot gaffe. The woman owns a huge farm that the boyfriend (Brody) knows nothing about - huh? The pair don't see the spontaneous sex-change coming - rather dense, for supposedly brilliant researchers.

The performances of Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley were exemplary, as always. I saw it for Sarah Polley as she is one of my favorite actors and one of the most underrated ones out there today. The actress that played Dren was also strong and had the perfect mix of human, alien, and innocence. The film addresses many scientific issues, but does so with a moral and emotional center. I like that the film doesn't pull punches and I like that there are consequences for the actions of the scientists. I thought the complex relationship of the couple and their creation was skillfully rendered and and excellently acted. Was it flawed? Sure.

Not because the tired plot about how humanity should never play god and such. Not because the abuse the characters are subjected to.No, I get angry because of the stupidity in the movie. This is about two supposedly brilliant geneticists who actually manage to create a new life form by splicing their own DNA and altering it. The result is a thing called Dren (Nerd backwards, someone really thought hard there).Now, making life and all that aside, the characters exhibit -extremely- poor judgment. They take a completely new life form out of a controlled environment (that has no security cameras at all) hide IT in the basement of the complex (without anyone noticing) and form emotional attachments to it. So involved to they get that they actually raise it like their own child. And then the ""father"" somehow thinks its a good idea to -have sex- with the it.Let that sink in a while. The -scientist- raises the being who starts out like an infant-looking thing and sees it mature, treating it like a child and then thinks its a good idea to have sex with his surrogate daughter/thing. Great judgment there, did he get his diploma via E-mail or something? But the hilarity doesn't stop there. Later the thing, having died a few times without much reaction from the ""parents"" becomes a man thing and -rapes- the female scientist. After it -killed- the ""father"" who is also the boyfriend of the female scientist. Then it is itself killed. ""Problem solved!"" you might think.Well no, because she becomes pregnant. And decides to complete the pregnancy without telling anyone except a shady evil corporate type person.-Really?- She decides to carry a hybrid of an extremely lethal life form who not only killed a whole bunch of people, one of them being the man she loved, and topped it off by raping her? And the movie ends with the line ""Whats the worst thing that can happen."" Honestly, this movie is a mockery to everything that science stands for, it shows a lack of understanding of how science is done and seems to portray scientists that do whatever just for the hell of it without any thoughts of consequences.Its clear that the makers of this movie had no idea what they were trying to do, a fitting analogy to the bland, flat out stupid characters that are supposed to pass as protagonists in this horror of a movie.Pretty good soundtrack though.",Splice

I have to say the movie was really good except for a few parts that seem to be unanswered/confusing qualities to the movie that to me seem to be a little frustrating, You can pick up on most of it from Little details but it wasn't gone into so much which I find frustrating Like why Elsa became so mean suddenly, and what exactly happened with her mother and her how she was treated etc. As for the storyline Very nice and interesting and I really Hope that there is a Second one the way the first one ended! ;) but If even your not a fan of this type of movie, I say give a chance you may be surprised",Splice
388,clay_more99,So this is how science works?,3,3 January 2013,"I found Splice in a bargain bin in a local video store, saw the names Guillermo Del Toro and Adrien Brody on the cover, and thought ""Why not?"". It does though turn out that Guillero Del Toro had very little to do with the movie, definitely not enough to warrant his name on the cover.The story of this movie is thin... very thin. And all the ""science"" in this movie is so incredibly unbelievable that it is staggering. Appearantly, throwing together a bunch of random DNA strings creates a strong, viable creature. Usually science involves a great deal of trial-and-error, and randomly combining a bunch of DNA would probably yield hundreds of failed specimens before anything remotely viable was created. Yet in Splice they get an overwhelmingly strong result in the very first try, with little explanation as to why.Whenever you randomly tamper with the body and with DNA, 99.99% of the results will always be negative to the creature. Yet in Splice, they manage to create a creature vastly superior to humans with no apparent drawbacks at all. Appearantly all those million years of evolution that made us was pointless, all it takes is two scientists spending a short montage worth of work to creature a super-creature.I might sound like I focus too much on this aspect of the movie, but it made the whole thing incredibly unbelievable to me. Whoever wrote the movie must have spent a very small amount of time reading up on scientific theory and genetics before writing the script. The lingo of the scientists is also way off.To sum it up, if you have the slightest interest in scientifically accurate movies, do not watch this movie If you have the slightest interest in believable character development, do not watch this movie If you want to see a dude have intercourse with a woman/fish/bird/scorpion/rabbit hybrid, watch Splice",Splice

He kind of left Sarah Polley behind in that respect. But what do you expect, he's an Oscar winner. The premise was decent. I didn't buy the French boss as someone of power. She was miscast in my opinion. The brother & lab supervisor were very good & good respectively. The use of only master shots at crucial points in the story was a red flag. It gave it a sense that the director didn't know how to effectively layout the story or the close-ups got messed up somehow in development (ie. when brothers talk in break room, the two leads talk in bed.) It did get creepy & scary.. I am always up for a good scare. The story moved along decently until the end when things went haywire. The build-up to Brody's crucial decision in the 3rd act was lacking. I don't know if it was his fault.. perhaps it stayed on cutting room floor or it wasn't in script. By the end, the audience was laughing in parts & so was I. I haven't laughed that much in a drama since Showgirls. Others have commented that this is the best movie of its kind since Alien.

But seriously, the sex scene....omg, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.And the whole gender-switch thing....that...well, no. Just no.

Its not horror, its certainly no science (don't get me started) but it is fiction... so much terrible fiction. There is such a real and overdue debate about the moral and ethical (I can never remember which is which) implications on the work of genetic modification and manipulation but this is not going to spark the debate. You can now buy a zebrafish from pet stores which have had genes from a jellyfish 'spliced' into the fish genome which will now 'glow in the dark'.

394,Long_Time_Lurker,A Cinematic Masterpiece,1,6 July 2011,"Where to begin? This movie had an intriguing premise, and as my satellite signal was temporarily unavailable, I decided to watch this DVD that my 18 year old son had rented.The story begins with our intrepid Gen X super-scientists (Clive and Elsa), toiling away at their evil corporate labs to sequence random DNA strands with the aim of engineering some sort of enzyme secreting ball of flesh. While not altogether on-board with management's goal of creating a super-duper panacea that is a cure all for everything from Parkinson's Disease to Diabetes to toenail fungus, they do it anyway, because you know, they drive a piece of crap AMC Pacer, so I assume that despite their high level of education, it's the best job they can get.So they go beyond the scope of the Evil Corporations plan to farm these enzyme secreter, and insert human DNA into the soup pot to see what would happen. This is where the train wreck that is SPLICE begins in earnest. Despite the obvious moral and ethical issues surrounding this course of action, these idiots bake themselves a creature that is part polly-wog, part human, part ostrich, part fish, part Teradactyl. It is a bald, fish-eyed hominid with Osterich Legs and T-Rex arms. This creature must be a super-genius, because the behaviour of both scientists from this point on is obviously the result of them lobotomizing each other for the sake of the creature (DREN). Elsa turns from a professional scientist conducting an experiment to Mommy of the Year, feeding, nurturing, educating and loving the freak-show reject that is DREN, who is growing at an accelerated rate. Clive is slower to begin his fawning and cooing at Dren, probably because he tried to drown her and failed. Dren grows quickly, showing all the stages of a normal girl's progression, going from temper-tantrum throwing 3 year old, to awkward and giggly adolescent, to girl/woman in about 15 minutes, with each stage related in a cringingly cornballish display.DREN, like any other teenager, goes through a rebellious stage and kills a full grown Barn Cat with her stinger(at what appears to be a farm that has been abandoned for years). This angers Mommy Elsa, who wants to teach DREN Discipline, and decides to perform surgery on DREN to remove her stinger, a fingernail like protuberance at the end of her tail. Not to worry, good-cop Daddy Clive cheers her up by teaching her how to boogie, or two step, or whatever kind of dance girl with backwards legs can get her feet around. This is truly where the corniest, most ham-fisted writing of possibly the decade comes into play. DREN, also possess some powers of seduction that nobody can resist, least of all Daddy Clive, who through no fault of his own (the seductress gets her power from SCIENCE), gives in to his lust, and bangs Uncle Fester right there on the barn floor. If that wasn't bad enough, Elsa walks in on them. Cue the ""our relationship is on the rocks"" girl runs away disgusted scene. So, they decide together they've gone to far, and they have to dispose of DREN. Lucky for them, Dren is morphing into the next stage of her evolution, but to them it appears as if she's died. Like the movie did about 45 minutes ago. They decide to burn everything that relates to DREN, including her blankets, clothes, toys, stuffed animals, and other things all globbish test tube tadpole-people have as children. Cue the sad memory montage, as Elsa looks at the toys and pictures DREN has drawn lovingly and with just the right wist. Anyway, DREN isn't dead, she's evolving into a he. A much more aggressive and nefarious DREN, who kills Clives boss, brother, and then proceeds to rape Elsa with is now penis-like tail. Our hero Clive tries to save Elsa, but like everything else he did in the movie, fails. DREN kills Clive, and the final scene takes place in the Corporate Office of the CEO, who gives Elsa a big fat payout in exchange for her silence, and her................baby. That's right, she's knocked up. Cue the most enjoyable part of this cheese-fest, the end credits.The plot has holes big enough to drive trucks though. The acting, while not the worst I've ever scene, is over the top and forced. I honestly expected more from Adrian Brody, he's made some good movies, not to mention won and Oscar for The Pianist. But I think he's hooked up with Nicolas Cage's agent, you know, the one that takes Oscar winning actors and slots them into horrific movies. Bangkok Dangerous anyone? If you are entertaining the thought of torturing somebody, make them watch this movie, with any 5 of Keannu Reeves movies for a chaser. Just horrible. So bad it wasn't even bad-good, ala Snow Dead.

It borrows from the 'Frankenstein' trope and steals from every trope in between. BOOOOORING. We predicted EACH MOVEMENT OF THE MOVIE from beginning to end.Plot: Mad scientists create genetically engineered life form. One scientist uses own DNA, keeps it secret. Life form is potentially dangerous. Anger. They allow life form to live. Female scientist loses objectivity. Sex. Find they cannot contain life form. Female scientist goes nuts. Sex. Life form freaks out and kills. Sex. Anger. Finally kill life form. Female scientist lives and is pregnant. Chooses to have baby. Fade to black.
EVERY SINGLE THING that happens in the movie foreshadows what continues to happen in the movie.Pros: Good CGI
Cons: Unimaginative and predictable plot. Zero oversight on top scientists and their projects. Female scientist goes from fairly sane to bat crazy in ONE SCENE. Life form is dangerous but they transport her in a CARDBOARD BOX. TWICE! Life form is dangerous but they put her in a drafty barn with only a small door lock and cameras for security. Dangerous life form can jump TWENTY FEET HIGH through top of barn. Life form can kick down doors! Life form can fly. Pretty sure she won't stay in the barn for too long.

Although being more a fan of space expeditions and this movie belongs to the advanced genetic engineering genre, it indeed captivated me for the full duration of the movie. The story is brilliant, but personally I feel the climax could have been much better. The last five minutes changed the flow of the story and took it to another level, a notch below where it should have actually gone. I was really confused about what actually happened. Though Elsa tells in a few words about what had happened, it was hard for me to digest it for some time. The movie raised more questions than answers by the time I completed watching. May be that itself was the purpose of the film. Then again, the closing scene was a relief. Overall I give 8/10 for the story, the flow, the effects and the characters - especially Dren!",Splice

If I had to guess I think that is where most of the vitriol from the reviews are from. The most negative thing I can say about the movie is that it does suffer from technobabble at times and the main adult characters seem ignorant about the consequences for their actions to the point of incompetence towards their jobs.

401,Dhelix,"A great mix of drama, horror, dark comedy and sci-fi - 2010's ""Let the Right One In""",8,7 June 2010,"Do you remember 2008's ""Let the Right One In?"" You know, the slow, smart, Swedish vampire movie that played like an art house film and divided audiences? Well, Splice is 2010's version of that. Similar to ""Let the Right One In"" only in budget, ambition, pace, melodrama, and low body count... Splice rewards the patient fan who loves what is possible within the horror and science fiction genres but who also craves something thoughtful, unique, unsettling, and daring too.I preferred ""Let the Right One in,"" myself and I think most people who also enjoyed ""Let the Right One In"" and found it to be a welcome addition to what's possible within genre films due to a greater emphasis on asking interesting questions (many critics thought it was refreshing and thought-provoking) will also find a lot to like in Splice. Now, don't get me wrong here; I'm not suggesting it's as good as ""Let the Right One In,"" which was one of my favorite films of that year, but I do think that it was made with the same type of fans in mind.Enough about that vampire movie from Sweden though because what this film has more in common with thematically and in tone is vintage David Cronenberg. This is a must see for any fan of Cronenberg's work as it's clearly inspired by him in numerous ways. In fact, part of the reason I gave this film an 8 is because I want Cronenberg fans to know that this movie exists and that it's worth seeing for them. It's a movie that asks a lot of questions about sexuality, ego,ambition, desire, and gender. Think Videodrome and the Fly and you're on the right track. This isn't a terrifying film as far as tension goes as much as it is creepy and unsettling.So, what about the people who haven't seen any of the films I'm talking about so far? Well, it's difficult for me to make a recommendation because my mind has been tainted and expanded by dark film making so what I would suggest is that you seek out some of the following movies also dealing with dark aspects of the human condition:Happiness - Blue Velvet - Let the Right One In - Videodrome - The Fly - Irreversible - American Psycho - Gattaca - The devil's backbone - The ThingThere are probably tons more but those are the first challenging films that jump out at me that deal with some similar themes of sexuality, violence, morality associated with genetics, gender questions, etc in different ways. Some on that list are critically acclaimed masterworks and while Splice isn't quite at their level... I think if you enjoy most or some of those films you'll find something to like In Splice so head to the theatre and support it if that's the case because chances are you didn't have the opportunity to support any of the above while they were in theatres either. Send a message with your dollars that you're sick of the mundane, focus group approach to storytelling where comic relief kicks in like a bad drum roll after every tense moment, and a single theme is presented early into the telling only to be resolved safely right at the end. Splice plays more like a foreign film (It's Canadian) where multiple questions are asked and perhaps not answered or left for you to think about. Those who are willing to veer into the darker recesses of the mind and ask questions of themselves will find a lot to like here.If none of what I'm talking about here matters to you at all then I think I can safely assume that this film isn't for you.",Splice

I love my sci-fi and am genuinely interested in a lot of the technology and ethics around this film's subject, but I cant think of a single good thing about the movie.The 'plot' is all over the place. The science facility is not at all credible, there is no control or security and the two main characters can get away with anything in there. The two main characters are terrible, they have a bad script, bad lines, completely change opinion / motivation several times within seconds, are totally unbelievable as intelligent scientists, and are both pretty unlikeable characters in the movie. I wonder if the lead actress played such a complete bitch just to sell the final scene of the movie. Whatever, there were no engaging performances here. The few supporting actors are pretty lame too and the plot is so transparent you can see exactly what their role is going to be from the moment they appear on screen.The creature, Dren, at the start, looks like a big dick. Then it looks like a big dick genetically crossed with a rubber chicken, which is unintentionally hilarious as it leaps about the lab. To be fair, by the time it is human-like it's a bit more realistic, and the actress who plays Dren does a good job of being half-human half-animal and really sells the effect by not speaking and just moving about in a very animal-like way.Overall, it simply requires too much suspension of belief throughout.

It's as if they assume that 99.9% of the audience has never taken a science class or watched PBS. I understand that the science often has to be ""stretched"" to make an exciting movie, but does science have to be completely ignored to the point that it becomes a bad joke?The two lead characters, supposedly brilliant scientists are about as unscientific as they could get.

Both types of opinion are, of course, valid (tho utterly mystifying to me) but I thought my viewpoint should be represented as well.There were about 7 other people at the showing I went to, all going in with the same expectations as I did. I was disappointed with the first hour of the movie, which I thought was bad without any hilarity, but the second half more than made up for it. My friend had actually read a complete summary of the film and thought it was a joke. There are no words to describe the ridiculousness of it all. The best I can do without giving anything away would be to describe it as a combination of The Graduate, Twilight, and Zombie Strippets. There were moments so cringe-inducing that I could not look at the screen. I have no idea whether Vincenzo Natali meant to make a comedy (satire? Robert Rodriguez-style B movie?) but I hope it was an attempt to create a serious discussion of the ethics of genetic manipulation because that would make it just that much funnier.

409,motbones,"Gene Splicing, Big Pharma & Family ""Love"" Like We Have Never Seen Before",8,6 June 2010,"Every year a select few films are released that invoke very strong reactions from their audiences. There is often no middle ground with these films. These films illicit one of two reactions ""love it"" or ""hate it."" I wish more of these films were released. These films cause discussion, discussion causes people to think, when people are forced to think this causes the film to be memorable. Memorable films, loved and hated, are what film-making is all about. Directors set out to make films that people will talk about and ultimately remember.Director Vincenzo Natali has effectively done this twice now. He first caused many to talk about one of his early films Cube. IT is difficult to find a sci-fi/horror fan that did not see that film. I remember having many discussions in this ancient thing called a chat room about Cube. It was either love or hate back in 1997 when that film was released. Fast forward to 2010 and Natali's Splice is causing the same discussion among audiences. I believe people are not comfortable with being uncomfortable. Splice makes you uncomfortable from the opening credits until the final fade to black. Splice is meant to disturb and in some cases horrify audiences. I went into this film fully expecting to see some disturbing images of violence and gore. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not the case. I found the characters and relationships in the film to be far more effectively disturbing than most violence and gore that could have been put on the screen. We are introduced to a family dynamic in this film unlike any we have seen on the screen before, especially in a film marketed by a major studio like this one. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley are in excellent form in this film. Both of them succeed in portraying the feelings many new parents experience as they are learning to raise a child for the first time. Many of these experiences are extremely exaggerated of course. However, the basics are still there like the frustration of not understanding what your child wants/needs and the anguish of seeing your child in pain and not knowing how to help our what to do and the frustration of dealing with maturing teenagers. This film introduces most American audiences to Delphine Chanéac who plays the character of Dren, the creation of the two scientists (Brody & Polley), with an eerie animal like performance. Chanéac's movements as the childlike creature are quick and precise like the animals that have been spliced with her human DNA and yet she has this innocence about her that is so effectively childlike as if she really is experiencing everything for the first time. The fear and curiosity in her eyes is something few actors are capable of pulling off so effectively. Splice is extremely effective in it's first two acts of building tension a causing the audience to really get involved in the film and invested in the characters. The third act however starts off strong, however an expected ""change"" takes place and the movie falls into some conventional horror movie pitfalls. I felt everything in the last 10 minutes of the film was too forced and out of sync with the rest of the film. The ending however did not ruin the film. Well written, well acted and well directed. This equals a win in my book. I commend everyone involved with making Splice for taking a bold knew step into the world of sci- fi/horror and giving us something original to remember, discuss for years to come. www.deathtothemovies.com",Splice
