0,MartinHafer,"Despite being an odd idea, it worked pretty well",7,2 June 2009,"John Wayne is a rancher who needs to get his cattle to market. However, in the surrounding towns, there is a bad case of ""gold fever"" and no one wants to help out with the roundup. In fact, Wayne rides high and low for ranch hands only to come up with nothing. In desperation, he even considers recruiting a few teens from the local school. However, they are all a young and very sorry lot and the Duke gives up the search. However, the next day, a group of these boys are at his ranch looking for work--even though their average age is only about 11. In addition to these recruits are a hot-headed Mexican as well as a few ex-cons (led by Bruce Dern) who are also let go because they are more trouble than they're worth. So, it's Wayne playin' wet nurse to a gaggle of boys who don't have much experience in a man's world--certainly an unusual idea to say the least!Naturally, the film is about the boys' ups and downs during this seemingly impossible drive as well as their progression to manhood. However, towards the end, there is a dandy plot twist and the boys manage to do so much more than would ever be expected of them. As a result, the film manages to take a very simple idea and make it work--though some might be appalled at the film's ultimate message about guns and death and all that (though I sure thought it was pretty cool).Overall, it's a good later John Wayne flick, thanks to some excellent supporting performances by Roscoe Lee Browne and Bruce Dern---as well as the kids. Look for a young Robert Carradine as one of the boys here in his debut film.",The Cowboys
1,bkoganbing,"""We're Burning Daylight""",8,7 February 2006,"I've always had a feeling that John Wayne had some kind of health crisis and deliberately chose The Cowboys to be his swan song film. When it didn't work out that way, he went on and did some more until The Shootist. Ever since his Oscar in True Grit, Wayne began playing men of his own age in his films and a common thread seemed to be imparting values to the next generations whether they wanted them or not. You can see that readily in films like Rio Lobo, Big Jake, Chisum, The Train Robbers, and Cahill, U.s. Marshal. Most especially in The Shootist with Ron Howard as his pupil.But in The Cowboys he had a mess of pupils. Wayne's a hardworking rancher whose hands have deserted him because of a rumored gold strike. He has to get his cattle to market, so out of desperation he hires a bunch pubescent and pre-pubescent youngsters from the town. The trail drive is quite the lesson for these kids. They learn about life that it is about hard work, responsibility, and keeping your given word. Wayne gets a second chance at fatherhood, he didn't do such a good job of it with his own two sons. More like grandfatherhood at his age, but the kids learn well.Along as a second role model is Roscoe Lee Browne. Possessor of one of the greatest speaking voices in the English speaking world, Browne is the first black man they've ever met. In fact one of the kids uses the ""N"" word when first meeting him, out of ignorance more than racism. Browne sets them straight by example more than preaching.The oldest two kids, A Martinez and Robert Carradine, have gone on to some considerable adult careers which they are still enjoying. All the kids are a winning bunch however.A couple of the Duke's later westerns like The Train Robbers and Cahill I found to be flawed. Not so here. Director Mark Rydell keeps this one going at a good pace and does wonders with his cast of all ages.",The Cowboys
2,Leofwine_draca,Something a little different for fans of the Duke,6,1 June 2017,"THE COWBOYS offers something a little different for fans of the Duke. Here he's playing an old-timer, passing on the good-spirited mantle to a bunch of rowdy kids who he takes under his wing and trains to be cowboys in the best old-fashioned sense. Wayne looks old here and plays up his frailty, but he still has his usual toughness and mannerisms and that twinkle in his eye that makes him an irresistible character.The only real problem I have with this is the cheapness of the filming style. The interior scenes look like they were shot on video and of a TV episode quality. The young stars of the show get little chance to shine but the film does benefit from an exceptionally slimy turn from Bruce Dern as the villain of the piece. The great Roscoe Lee Browne also has a fine supporting role and makes the most of his screen time. Some parts of the film are familiar to the point of being clichéd, but THE COWBOYS builds as it goes on and finishes with a hard-hitting climax that pays off.",The Cowboys
3,SnoopyStyle,Bruce Dern and the Duke,7,14 December 2013,"Rancher Wil Andersen (John Wayne) needs to bring his cattle to market. Only all his ranch hands have run off to chase the latest gold rush. He has no choice but use a bunch of boys to do a man's job. He, the boys, and the cook Jebediah Nightlinger (Roscoe Lee Browne) have to face obstacles including bandits led by Long Hair (Bruce Dern).It's late in the Duke's career, but he still has his swagger. There are a few too many boys. Some of them tend to blend together. It's a minor problem. As for the villain, Bruce Dern is great as both a weasel and a menace. Sometimes we don't get both. This time we get a good portion of both.There is some good cattle driving action. The final fight is a little bit hokey. I wish for some dirty gritty action. But it's good enough. The best scene occurs a little earlier with Bruce Dern facing off against the Duke. That is a classic scene.",The Cowboys
4,classicsoncall,"""...nothing but cowboys, just like the word says.""",8,11 August 2015,"You would think the plot employed in this movie would have been used extensively before, but I believe this is the first time I've ever run across it. With rancher Wil Andersen's (John Wayne) hired hands going for the gold, he breaks down and hires a passel of young school kids to make a cattle drive. I found it interesting that the schoolmarm Miss Ellen (Allyn Ann McLerie) used a Montgomery Ward catalog for reading lessons because of it's well constructed grammar. Something to think about.I'm reading some of the other reviews here and had to wonder why so many writers called Bruce Dern's character 'Long Hair', presumably because that's how he's listed in the credits for the movie here. He introduced himself to Andersen by the name of Asa Watts before being summarily fired even before being hired. I've seen Dern in these kinds of skeevy roles before, but never so downright vicious. His gunning of Andersen which sets up the movie's final showdown between the cowboy factions is downright brutal. It might have been Wayne's most violent death in film.So you have a gritty coming of age picture here, and I was keenly attentive to see how the film progressed the characters over the course of the story. Starting out as green gilled pre-pubescent young boys for the most part, the process of maturing them along the way was handled quite deftly under the watchful eye of director Mark Rydell. I got a kick out of Roscoe Lee Brown's character when he first came on the scene, questioning Wil Andersen's hiring preferences - ""Well, doesn't anything larger wanna work for you?"" Clearly if made today, the picture would register it's fair share of opposition for the way the boys sought to avenge their mentor and former trail boss. I don't remember any reaction back when this was made but then again, I wasn't really paying attention. It's an age old dilemma that different generations handle things differently. For my part, I vote with Slim Honeycutt (Robert Carradine) when he says ""We're gonna finish the job"".",The Cowboys
5,rmax304823,Surprisingly Naturalistic.,6,15 January 2012,"Judging from the title alone -- in its full splendor it's ""Jonn Wayne and the Cowboys"" -- it sounds like just another one of those routine and mind-numbing attempts to cash in on Wayne's heroic image in the setting of the Old West. He ground out lots of these Sonicburgers in the 70s.In most ways, that's what it is. Wayne must drive his herd of cattle through Montana. The local cowpokes have caught gold fever and left, so Wayne must hire a dozen little boys, the oldest of them being fifteen. The only other adult is the cook Roscoe Lee Brown, who serves as Wayne's conscience.Wayne is a tough taskmaster. When one of the boys dozes in the saddle, Wayne doesn't just wake him up. He pushes him roughly off his horse. (""I pay a day's wages, I expect a day's work."") There are thinly disguised clichés in the script. One boy can't speak without stuttering until Wayne taunts him and insults him and the kid says, ""You SOB!"", without a stutter, forever cured. (Usually they throw away their crutches.) Supporting players have names like Jeb, Slim, Weedy, and Matt.Wayne attempts nothing new, as he had in, say, ""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,"" ""The Searchers"", and ""True Grit."" He coasts along on his honorable John Wayneness. His wardrobe is the same as in the other efforts of this late period -- leather vest, high neckerchief, the usual hat -- although this time the color of the shirts under the vest is subdued.But there are a couple of surprises. For one thing, he's finally given a plain-looking wife his own age. He's allowed to curse the aging process seriously. A fight with the no-goodnik Bruce Dern is particularly brutal. Instead of a simple clip on the jaw, Wayne must beat hell out of Dern to keep him down, and he takes many bruises in the process. And I can think of some movies in which Wayne is killed in combat or dies some heroic death. Here he gets shot in all his limbs before the mortal wound and it takes him quite a while to die.And, although the ending provides the catharsis that the audience needs, I can't help wondering if it's a good idea to show that one of the lessons the kids learn is that all the bad guys should be slaughtered in the most painful way, whether they're armed or not.By this time, Wayne must have had a lot of control over his material. I'm surprised that he allowed his character to be killed off so viciously. I'm also a little surprised that he repeats, multiple times, the metaphor, ""We're burning daylight."" It's from Shakespeare, who used it more than once. That should have carried a neon sign -- ""Unclean"" -- right there. That's not even to mention the pretty tune by Vivaldi played on a guitar.",The Cowboys
6,ma-cortes,"Above average , enjoyable western with a great cast and awesome John Wayne as a tough cattle rancher",7,26 January 2017,"Wayne stars an upright cattle rancher , Wil Andersen ; when his cattle drivers abandon him for the gold fields , he is forced to hire 11 school boys (Sean Kelly , Clay O'Brien , A. Martínez , Robert Carradine film debut , among others) whose ages ranging from 9 to 17 to help him drive his cattle 400 miles to market . As the pre-teenaged boys in New Mexico Territory fight off grownup cattle rustlers under the tutelage of rancher Wil (John Wayne who strides the flick like a dinosaur) and his helper Jebediah Nightlinger (Roscoe Lee Browne) . As they are recruited to work for the cattle rancher , all they wanted was their chance to be men and he gave it to them . But they are pursued and finally attacked by a group of rustlers led by Long Hair (Bruce Dern). With Wil Andersen and ranch-hand Mr. Nightlinger as father figures , as they wet-nursing an entire crew of sub-teenagers on a cattle drive , as the boys learn to become men through hard work , discipline and the usual Western battles with robbers .Nice and agreeable western with a great cast and a sensational John Wayne against his nemesis magnificently played by Bruce Dern in one of his meatiest roles as the villain . Top-notch Western packs clever plot , thrills , family feeling , slightly stylized action , shoot'em up , and turns out to be pretty entertaining ; in spite of the over-sentimentality inherent in this project produced/directed by Mark Rydell . Besides , it contains good feeling as friendship , faithfulness , companionship , and enjoyable father-adopted sons relationship . And the results make extremely amusing and thundering entertainment . Furthermore , an anti-racism subtext on Roscoe Lee Browne role was written into the script in response to ongoing criticism of John Wayne , it makes this one of Wayne's better Westerns . Wayne's image still remained impervious during the seventies surviving through an overlong career . Wayne unmistakeably a legendary figure of the West and by that time he would go playing good Westerns , as he triumphantly survived his own era with titles as ¨True grit¨ in which he won an Academy Award ,¨Big Jake¨, ¨Train robbers¨ , ¨Rooster Cogburn¨ , his last film ¨The Shootist¨, and ,of course , this ¨The cowboys ¨ . In some ways is a companion movie to posterior ¨Cahill , United States Marshal¨ also involved John with kiddies . The screenplay is plain and simple , with a conventional plot , but ultimately gets overcome . Gorgeous outdoors with decent production design , shot on location in Castle Rock , Durango Colorado , Chama , Galisteo , New Mexico , Sonoita , Elgin , Arizona , and Empire Ranch , Arizona . Colorful and spectacular cinematography in Panavision by Robert L. Surtees . Rousing and emotive musical score by John Williams in his ordinary style . And you'll love both the lightning unexpected finale and the performance of Roscoe Lee Browne as Wayne's friend and food supplier . It inspired the TV series with similar cast as Robert Carradine , A Martínez , Sean Kelly , Clay O'Brien and Moses Gunn as Jebediah Nightlinger .This well-paced film was compellingly directed by Mark Rydell . Pic contains Rydell's usual themes as familiar feeling , a little bit of charming humor , friendship and and sense of comradeship among people . Mark does the human touch and full of insight that accompanied him during most of his films and the story develops pleasantly in large frames with an interesting plot and fully adjusted to the requirements of the action . Mark Rydell directed a lot of films as ¨Even Money , ¨Crime of the century¨ , ¨Intersection¨, ¨For the boys¨ , ¨Harry and Walter go to N.Y.¨, ¨Cinderella Liberty¨ and ¨The ¨Reivers¨, though his winning years were the 70s and 80s with successes as ¨The rose¨(79) , ¨On Golden pond¨ (81) , ¨The river¨(84) and this ¨The cowboys¨ .",The Cowboys
7,moonspinner55,Insipid and vulgar,1,8 December 2002,"Heavy-handed western about eleven young boys becoming ""men"" while on rigorous cattle drive. Crude and violent, it's probably John Wayne's worst movie next to ""The Conqueror"". Bruce Dern, as another in his stable of wild-eyed villains, overdoes it once again, and in his last scene with Wayne vilified himself for years to come. The film, poorly directed by Mark Rydell, has no western nostalgia for the past, and no soul-searching for a future. It's all laid out in a bland, barren fashion, without anybody to care about and children one would cross the street in order to avoid. Wayne does his usual walk-through, but kids don't seem to be his thing (he's not much of a father-figure, more like a ornery distant relative). Highly inflated, nauseatingly self-righteous and self-important.",The Cowboys
8,wes-connors,John Wayne's Burning Daylight,5,28 December 2010,"Sometime after the U.S. Civil War, sixty-something Montana cowboy John Wayne (as Wil Anderson) loses his ranch-hands to gold fever. With no men to accompany him on an important round-up, Mr. Wayne reluctantly employs ten adventurous schoolboys. Familial acting Robert Carradine (as ""Slim"" Honeycutt) leads the charge. Joining them are chief cook and bottle-washer Roscoe Lee Browne (as Jebediah Nightlinger) and ticked-off drop-out A Martinez (as Cimarron).The young lads shoot guns, get drunk, and almost meet a band of traveling prostitutes. Things go reasonably well until long-haired hippie-type Bruce Dern (as Asa Watts) decides to make trouble for Wayne and the boys. Sometimes Wayne is a grouchy old man; stay tuned, as he has some interesting last scenes. Despite whatever director Mark Rydell and the writers were shooting for, the ""Duke"" has the last laugh; and, the ideology is conservative. The Kids Are Alright.***** The Cowboys (1/13/72) Mark Rydell ~ John Wayne, Roscoe Lee Browne, Bruce Dern, Robert Carradine",The Cowboys
9,michaelRokeefe,Boys become cowboys.,8,16 January 2012,"This is an over-looked John Wayne picture probably due to misconceptions concerning the storyline. The Duke plays an aging rancher Wil Anderson, who has a problem finding local cowboys to sign on for a cattle drive. At the time most men had gold fever and were hard to find. Anderson is forced to hire schoolboys to help him drive cattle 400 miles from Montana to South Dakota. A coming of age for impressionable young boys. This odd ragtag group of wranglers and drovers is joined by Jebediah Nightlinger(Roscoe Lee Browne)as chuck wagon cook, who happens to be the first black man most of the boys have ever seen. Not that this cattle drive wasn't trying enough...a group of cattle thieves led by Long Hair(Bruce Dern)think it will be easy to rustle from an old man with a bunch of boys. Very soon it is time to stand and be counted. The drive will not end without its drama. Fantastic movie. Some of the featured young cowboys: Robert Carradine, A Martinez, Mike Pyeatt, Alfred Barker Jr. and Steve Benedict. Dern does not disappoint as the villain. He is so easy to dislike. Browne is outstanding helping Wayne turn the boys into cowboys. Beautiful scenery and a pace that makes you forget you've just invested over two hours.",The Cowboys
10,hitchcockthelegend,The Breaking of Boys and the Making of Men.,8,9 May 2011,"The Cowboys is directed by Mark Rydell and adapted from the novel written by William Dale Jennings; who co-writes the screenplay with Irving Ravetch & Harriet Frank Jr. It stars John Wayne, Roscoe Lee Browne, Bruce Dern and Colleen Dewhurst. John Williams scores the music and Robert Surtees is the cinematographer. Plot sees Wayne as tough cattleman Wil Andersen, who after finding all his cowhands have fled to find their fortune elsewhere, is forced to use a bunch of green teenagers to get his beef to market. It's a journey of some distinction, for Wil, the boys and the villains who lurk on the edges of the frame.If ever there was a John Wayne picture that was in need of serious critical reevaluation, both as a measure of his acting ability-and quality in film narrative, then The Cowboys is the one. It's a film that has been known to upset the liberal minded, where the ideology at its core has been lambasted as being objectionable in the least. Yet looking at it closely, away from the humour that does exist within, it finds the Duke at his most vulnerable, therefore believable, and at its centre it's a coming of age tale told with cynical coldness. During this cattle drive innocence will be lost, Andersen is tough and a disciplinarian, yet he's always a benevolent father figure. Wil himself hit the cattle drive trail at 13, he knows the pains and perils of such a task. He also knows that boys need to become men, especially out here in the wilderness. I'd be disappointed in a piece of Western genre cinema if it glossed over this fact. And The Cowboys doesn't, it has a sting in its tail, the trick is that the boys are not judged by how Wil taught them, but defined by a turn of events that calls on them to ""man"" up. The actions of another being the catalyst for childhood's ending.Robert Surtees' photography paints a beautiful picture, it's pastoral, broad and appealing, but crucially it doesn't make it poetic. These young lads are entering the unknown, each section of God's great land is beautiful to us, but dangerous to them. It's an overlooked point that critics of the film ignore, that of Wil Andersen not leading these boys on a romantic trip thru the colourful terrain. It's not romantic, it's dangerous, and it's credit to Surtees that he achieves both sides of the coin; beauty and peril in the same frame. The young actors are, expectedly, a mixed bunch, but there's nothing here to be overtly negative about. Roscoe Lee Browne is terrific, his shift from wry observationalist to ""Mother Hen"" is handled with great skill, and Bruce Dern is memorable in more ways than one. The complaints come from not enough screen time for Colleen Dewhurst, who playing a bordello madame positively threatens to send the film's rating thru the roof (and the male viewers temperature's), while the running time is simply too long-too episodic-and quite frankly, unnecessary.The Cowboys is not a perceived John Wayne macho based fantasy movie, it has meaning, depth, bravery and a first class performance from the Duke himself. 8/10",The Cowboys
11,Theo Robertson,If You Don't Like Westerns Then ....,4,30 October 2004,".... You won't like this movie In many ways THE COWBOYS is very similar to THE CULPEPPER CATTLE COMPANY , both are westerns crossed genred with a rites of passage/coming of age story . But where as THE CULPEPPER CATTLE CO deconstructs myths THE COWBOYS is very much the traditional clichéd western with a lot of wish fufillment thrown in John Wayne plays The Duke and this time his name is Wil Anderson . It's basically the same role he played since first appearing in movies . He's full of White Anglo Saxon Protestant virtue but is very inclusive too . It doesn't matter what race or age you are as long as you can steer cattle across the American wilderness you will have the undying respect from Mr Anderson - Yawn . To be fair there's something involving the plot that makes THE COWBOYS stick out from most of Wayne's other movies . You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it so I won't spoil it for you , but at the end of the day it's a movie with little appeal to audiences who aren't all that keen on westerns . Bruce Dern is one slight saving grace as an evil villain with racist views but he's slightly difficult to take seriously because he's written in a melodramatic manner . Compare him to Geoffry Lewis and Bo Hopkins in THE CULPEPPER CATTLE CO and tell me who would terrify you most as a work colleague ?",The Cowboys
12,Doylenf,"Excellent western, vastly overlooked but among John Wayne's best...",7,25 May 2007,"THE COWBOYS is a terrific western with a twist--the ""boys"" are indeed boys, teen-aged lads fresh out of a country schoolhouse but able to serve as the cowboys JOHN WAYNE needs to drive a herd of cattle 400 miles away to market. Wayne seems to be in the same position he was facing in RED RIVER, wherein finding the right cowboys for the long cattle drive was the main focus of the story.There's plenty of scenic splendor in vivid Technicolor, a rousing western score by John Williams, and the cast of youngsters all give solidly natural performances under Mark Rydell's direction.Outstanding work by ROSCOE LEE BROWNE as the black cook on the chuck wagon who knows how to deal with a bunch of rambunctious boys, and with an instinct for knowing when not to trust them with mischief. He plays a key role in the story and he's terrific.Plenty of other good character roles are filled by BRUCE DERN, as the principal villain whose sadistic scene with a young boy is enough to curl your hair, and COLLEEN DEWHURST as the wise madame on the road with her girls.The story hooked me from the start, kept me interested all the way through and only veered into tougher territory during the last forty minutes or so with the brutal showdown between Wayne and Dern. And then it moved briskly, taking an unexpected twist toward the last fifteen minutes.Summing up: An overlooked gem and one of JOHN WAYNE's best movies. He gives a performance of true grit--and so do the boys!!",The Cowboys
13,writers_reign,"Here's Looking At You, Kids",8,29 March 2009,"On paper this shouldn't have survived the Pitch but on celluloid it metamorphoses into a fine almost folksy film which, like the central cattle drive, succeeds against all the odds. The central premise is simplicity personified; ageing rancher Duke Wayne needs to get his cattle to market, normally this is no problem but he needs to do it NOW and it's only days since gold fever struck with a vengeance leaving no one available for the drive. Necessity being the mother of invention Duke is more or less forced to recruit some genuine cowBOYS inasmuch as he turns literally to a group of schoolboys who know absolutely nothing about driving cattle long distances and have even less experience. Throw in a Black cook cum philosopher cum fount-of-all-wisdom, a peripatetic troupe of hookers and a Very, Very BAD man in the shape of Bruce Dern, leading a gang of rustlers and we're talking one of the most entertaining Westerns that ever came down the pike.",The Cowboys

Duke's terrific and has fine support from Roscoe Lee Browne, Slim Pickens, and Colleen Dewhurst. The younger actors playing the cowboys of the title are all pretty good. Robert Carradine makes his film debut here. Bruce Dern is a particularly nasty villain. Nice music and solid script. It's a little longer than it needs to be but I don't think it wears out its welcome. It's got humor, drama, and action. Not his best but one of the better movies Duke made in the '70s.",The Cowboys
15,zardoz-13,A Different Kind of John Wayne Western,10,21 March 2013,"Any western with the legendary John Wayne is worth a glance. ""On Golden Pond"" director Mark Rydell's cattle drive opera ""The Cowboys"" is as offbeat an oater as you'll ever see. When a veteran rancher loses his hired hands because they'd rather pan for nuggets than push steers, he takes on school children to serve as his drovers. The premise is fresh and like nothing John Wayne ever tried during his long career in the cinema. Basically, ""The Cowboys"" is ""Red River"" with youngsters. This existential tale of initiation about boys becoming men is memorable because the kids are all interesting characters in their own right. Actually, Rydell and two-time Oscar-nominated scenarists Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr have fashioned a western that is politically incorrect as you imagine. After the villainous Bruce Dern shoots John Wayne multiple times in the back, the kids exact vengeance on Dern and his dastards by killing them all in an ambush. The last thing that you'd expect to see in a John Wayne is children brutalized and then brutalizing men twice their age without a qualm. Robert Surtees lensed this sprawling outdoors saga and even the scenes on the Warner Brothers sound stage in Burbank look spectacular. ""Star Wars"" composer John Williams provides an orchestral score that enhances not only the suspense but also develops the characters, especially the villains. The scribes borrow from other films. For example, the subplot involving Long Hair (Bruce Dern) who threatens one boy, Dan, is reminiscent of Charles Dickens ""Great Expectations."" The kids are a tyke-sized collection of ""The Magnificent Seven,"" and the subplot about the outcast Mexican who isn't hired immediately but who tags along in their wake is like Horst Buchholz's young gunslinger in the classic Sturges' film. The boys experience just about everything you can imagine. They ride, rope, curse, shoot, and kill. Colleen Dewhurst has a cameo as a madam. Bruce Dern makes a terrific villain and he told Rydell that he believes he ruined his career when he killed Wayne in a particularly bloody scene.",The Cowboys

What follows is a journey of discovery and a transformation of boys to men...Not your typical John Wayne movie. Wayne is less of the hero here, and more a paternal figure. After all, he was 65 years old when this movie was made, so his days of acting the invincible hero were behind him. However, for all the one-dimensional casting of him as a hero, here he shows a more balanced aspect to his acting. Interesting plot, with a dramatic, un-John Wayne-like twist near the end.

John Wayne, as Wil Anderson (and without irony), tells one of the impressionable youngsters under his tutelage in THE COWBOYS. These words of wisdom come not long after Wil's shouted at a sobbing 10-year-old, ""Listen to me, you whining little whelp, you're going to stop that stutter or get the Hell out of here!"" Does anyone else see a disconnect here? Of course, it's easy for a scriptwriter to command a child actor WITHOUT A REAL LIFE STUTTER to be instantly ""cured"" of that ""character defect"" by ""Il Duce's"" verbal abuse. In Real Life, Wayne set himself up as a dictator of ""American"" Values, thinking that if his Big Mouth simply shouted, ""Stop being a stutterer! Stop being Gay! Stop being Jewish! Stop being Black! Stop being Liberal! Stop loving our Constitution! Just stop Thinking!"" loud enough, he'd be a Big Man in a country carved in His likeness. Wayne famously bad-mouthed Gary Cooper's heroic HIGH NOON sheriff for asking supposedly ""ill-suited"" ADULTS to form a posse in the face of an existential threat to the entire town. Wayne and his fellow traveler, director Howard Hawks, made RIO BRAVO as a ""rebuttal"" to HIGH NOON. Now, a few years after RIO BRAVO, Wayne plays a rancher who Shanghais a group of ILL-SUITED 10-year-old BOYS for life-threatening grown-up work just because this rancher is facing a PERSONAL financial setback.

Roscoe Lee Browne plays the wise black cook while Slim Pickens & Colleen Dewhurst have small roles. This is a realistic, almost epic Wayne Western focusing on the long cattle drive and the amateur boys learning to be men. It lacks the fun brawling and unrealistic elements of John's contemporary Westerns of the 60s-70s (e.g. the quick-draw nonsense in ""El Dorado""). A Martinez stands out as the outcast Hispanic amongst the kids while Bruce Dern is notable as a menacing ne'er-do-well. The almost shocking confrontation that opens the final act is a highlight and the boys' just strategy is great: KILL 'EM ALL. The film runs 134 minutes and was shot in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Warner Brothers Burbank Studios, California. The screenplay was based on William Dale Jennings's novel.

20,JamesHitchcock,Anti-revisionist Western which triumphantly celebrates the myth of the Old West,6,20 April 2009,"""The Cowboys"" is, as its name implies, a film about cowboys, with the stress on the second syllable of that word. Wil Andersen, a Montana cattle rancher, needs to get his cattle to the railhead at Belle Fourche, South Dakota, but has a problem. A gold rush is on, and all the able-bodied men in the area, including his own hired hands, have gone off to prospect for gold. Andersen's solution is to recruit the local schoolboys (in their early or mid teens, and some looking even younger than that) as hands on his cattle drive. All the boys can already ride, and under Andersen's guidance they learn to rope, brand and herd the cattle. On the trail, however, they face danger, as they are shadowed by a gang of rustlers who think that cattle guarded only by young boys will provide them with easy pickings.The film was a controversial one when it first came out in 1972, as it was seen as a pro-Vietnam war allegory. The youngsters who answer Andersen's call to help drive his cattle were seen as symbolic of the young men who were answering their country's call to fight in Vietnam. The leader of the villains, played by Bruce Dern, has long hair, often regarded in the sixties and seventies as a sign of political radicalism. Indeed, he is referred to in the cast list simply as ""Long Hair"", although at one point he gives his name as Asa Watts.Possibly the controversy was based upon a preconception that any film starring John Wayne must have a hidden right-wing subtext. In fact, Wayne was not the first choice for the role; director Mark Rydell, who disagreed with Wayne about politics, especially about his attitude to Vietnam, was reluctant to cast him and would have preferred George C. Scott. Nevertheless, Wayne (as he normally did) was able to make the role completely his own, so much so that it becomes difficult to imagine any other actor, including Scott, in the part. He receives good support from Roscoe Lee Browne as Jebediah Nightlinger, the black camp cook in charge of the chuck wagon, but none of the young actors who play the boys make much impression. Like the Chinese storekeeper in ""True Grit"", Nightlinger serves as a welcome reminder that not every inhabitant of the West was either white or an Indian. The tone of the film is anti-racist, even if seventies film-makers were less squeamish about the so-called ""n-word"" than their modern counterparts.Wayne's domination of the film caused a problem for the film-makers. Andersen dies when he is shot in the back by Long Hair. (To shoot someone in the back was, in the Old West, regarded as a particularly despicable form of killing, although to my way of thinking to shoot an unarmed man in the front is equally cowardly. Following this scene Bruce Dern became, for a time, the most hated man in America, at least among Wayne fans who equated him with the character he played). From this point onwards the film deals with the way in which the boys avenge Andersen's death. Under normal circumstances, the revenge sub-plot would probably have been given much more prominence, and much more screen-time, than it receives here. These were not, however, normal circumstances, The film-makers doubtless realised that audiences wanted to see John Wayne, not a gang of unknown boys, and that no other actor could carry the film in the same way as he could. Wayne is therefore kept on screen for as long as possible, with the killing coming very late on in the action, and the revenge sub-plot forming a brief, and rather rushed, coda to the film.Rydell may not have intended his film to reflect right-wing political values, but there can be no doubt that it does reflect conservative artistic and cultural ones. The late sixties and early seventies were the heyday of the ""revisionist"" Western, the sub-genre which sought to portray the West with greater realism and to get away from sharp black-and-white moral distinctions. (Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"" and Robert Altman's ""McCabe and Mrs Miller"" are good examples). ""The Cowboys"" is not a film of this type. Like most of Wayne's Westerns from this period (""True Grit"" being another example) it is defiantly anti-revisionist. It is far from realistic (could any team of raw youngsters really have achieved all the boys do in this film?) and the distinction between good and evil is as clear-cut as the most ardent moralist could wish for. Far from subverting the heroic myth of the Old West (the aim of most of the revisionists), ""The Cowboys"" triumphantly celebrates it.For a modern audience, most of the film's appeal lies not in any assumed Vietnam subtext but in its themes of ""coming of age"" and of the relationship between the generations. The boys achieve manhood through hard work and discipline, and learn the importance of honesty, loyalty, and fighting for one's beliefs. Andersen, whose own two sons are both dead, becomes a father-figure to them. (Some have even seen him as a Christ-figure, giving his life to save them from the bandits). Its rather clumsy structure means that ""The Cowboys"" is not Wayne's greatest Western, but it does have its points of interest. 6/10",The Cowboys

23,zkonedog,Gritty Western That Showcases Some Incredible Acting,10,5 March 2017,"Most of the time, a movie needs a really solid plot to truly be great. ""The Cowboys"" is an exception to this rule, however, as the acting of John Wayne, Bruce Dern, and the adolescent cast make this gritty Western stand the test of time.For a basic plot summary, ""The Cowboys"" sees rancher Wil Andersen (Wayne) deserted by his ranch hands just days before a big scheduled cattle drive. In a bind, Andersen takes on a group of schoolboys to help him bring in the herd. Along the way, key roles also include a Mexican ""mistake of nature"" teenager named Cimarron (A Martinez), a Negro cook (Roscoe Lee Browne), and a slimy ex-con ""Long Hair"" (Dern) determined to get the best of Andersen and his rather motley crew.As I mentioned, this film is a bit short on plot in terms of believability. It isn't ""gritty"" in the sense of portraying stark reality.However, director Mark Rydell more than makes up for this hole by conjuring up some of The Duke's greatest emotive scenes ever caught on camera. The chemistry between Wayne and Dern is unmatched in the history of Duke movies, while his changing relationship with the boys is quite an emotional journey for the viewer.Yet, at the same time, this isn't a purely ""dark"" movie by any means. It contains quite a bit of humor and levity which perfectly balances out those scenes that are so poignant and utterly humorless.Overall, I can confidently put ""The Cowboys"" in my list of top Westerns. It has terrific acting, a good mix of camaraderie/emotion, plays on many themes such as boys becoming men, how to deal with evil in its basest form, and the kind of life being a cattle rancher/driver was all about.",The Cowboys

25,weezeralfalfa,"'Old Ironpants', 'beloved husband and father', heads a classic 'coming of age' story.",9,18 May 2013,"Bruce Dern(as ""Long Hair'), despite limited screen time, steals this one, as the charismatic, sassy talking, intimidating bully leader of an otherwise silent band of rustlers that smell easy pickings from Wil Anderson's(Duke Wayne) 1500 head of cattle, being driven 400 miles to market by a dozen greenhorn schoolboys, headed by Wil and his African American cook(Roscoe Lee Browne). Dern's verbal and physical bullying of small bespectacled Dan, alone out in the bush, is especially memorable. Of course, Long Hair is eventually exposed as cowardly, picking on a combination of an old man and boys to intimidate, getting beat in a rough and tumble with 'Old Ironpants' Wayne, then shooting Wayne multiple times with his back turned. Later, he and his gang are outwitted and outgunned by a combination of Browne and the boys, after Duke says his dying farewell speech. Of course, Anderson would have nixed any idea of the boys acting hostile toward the sizable outlaw gang. He already had lost one boy from trampling. Browne, as Anderson's apparent successor as the boys immediate father figure, was of the same mind, but the boys weren't going to let him interfere with their determination to extract revenge from the rustlers. Thus, he eventually gives in and presumably supplies most of the ideas on how to defeat the crooks and get back the cattle and horses. First, they need a few more horses, thus lure a few of the herd-flanking bandits into ambushes in the woods. Then, they lure the remaining bandits into an ambush, hiding behind boulders and vegetation around a strategically-placed chuck wagon, with Browne cooking supper. How could the bandits be so stupid as to ride into this ambush? They didn't know that a locked chest of firearms was in the chuck wagon, having previously disarmed Duke of the only apparent firearm in the party. Thus, they weren't expecting the possibility of a gun ambush, especially from a bunch of boys. Also, some of the boys stampeded the extra horses through the camp just before the bullets began to fly, adding to the confusion. Still, it would have been more convincing if we had seen Duke instruct the boys on using their firearm, before the drive began. On the other hand, that probably would have scared off the parental approval of this already dangerous undertaking. This is a major detail that is totally ignored. It's just assumed that all the parents agreed to this dangerous mission, without a whimper. Just when and where did this venture supposedly take place? We have several inconsistent clues. Duke's ranch is north of Yellowstone Park, near Bozeman, and he is driving his herd toward Belle Fourche, SD. This town began to become a major cattle shipment depot in 1890, although there was a blip of local food demand in the 1876-8 period, relating to the Black Hills gold rush. There is a gold rush that has siphoned off all the ranch hands. Where? His ranch hands say not far from Bozeman. Well, there was a major gold rush to this general area in the 1863-6 period. At one point, Duke says he is going to Fort Smith to check on the Sioux situation. Well, the Ft. Smith in south central MT only existed for a year or so around 1866! It was built in connection with the MT gold rush, then abandoned, due to Sioux demands. But Duke says his deceased sons would now be around 40, and their grave markers say they were born in '37 and '38, which would mean this is around '77, during the Black Hills gold rush! In conclusion, the historical clues don't add up, but '76-'78 is clearly the consensus. The film was actually shot in several locations in NM and SW Colorado.This is a rather long film, thus the director thought it merited an opening overture, with a pitch black screen, and an intermission. The opening credits begin rather dramatically with the blackness of the overture gradually becoming a sunrise, as a horse herd thunders by... 5 riders show up at Wil's ranch house to say that they are debating whether to join his other former hands in taking a chance in the gold fields. Wil tells them to get off his property, leaving him with no hands. Later, he says his deceased sons were failures, or maybe he failed them. Would have been nice to know what he meant and how they died, the same year: '58. Bloody Kansas? Browne comments that he now has a second chance, with all these boys.In a film with very little screen time involving women and no budding romance, Collen Dewhurst was very lucky to get 4th billing as the head madame of an itinerant group of prostitutes the boys happen upon out in the wilderness. This brief episode didn't lead anywhere and was best deleted.Long Hair is sometimes interpreted as a stand in for the anti-war hippies when this film was made. Instead of shooting him, the boys opt for a much more painful death, befitting his treatment of 'Old Ironpants' and others.",The Cowboys

Mr Wayne displays that characteristic in ""The Cowboys"",Mark Rydell's almost sepia vision of the late - flowering Western. As a child I sat through dozens of cattle - drive movies at the Saturday Morning Pictures in the early 1950s.The heat,swirling dust and whooping cowboys were a heady brew and a million miles from the leafy lanes of Surrey.These early cheapies had a profound affect on me and it felt strange to be still gripped by their magic as late on as ""City Slickers"" which to me was much more a Western than a comedy. Here we have a cattle - drive movie with a hook not unlike - as has been mentioned - ""Red River"".Mr Wayne recruiting men to take his herd for slaughter.Forced by circumstances to rely on a group of schoolboys Mr Wayne sets out on the trail to give them a number of life lessons. Assisted by the admirable Mr Roscoe Lee Browne he begins the task of turning them into real cowboys. When Mr Wayne is killed bravely taking on a murderous rustler,the boys,aided by Mr Browne,complete the drive and revenge his death. Like ""Lord of the flies"",""The Cowboys"" lifts the thin veneer of so - called civilised behaviour from these children and they kill mercilessly and with every appearance of relish.Contemporary audiences may have problems with this,but it was the way things were done.Much the same occurred in ""The river of no return"" where Robert Mitchum's son gunned down Rory Calhoun by backshooting him without a sign of remorse or any need for subsequent counselling.It was a hard life on the Frontier and only the strongest and most ruthless survived. Mr Wayne - constantly badmouthed by the so - called ""liberals"" he roundly despised - was simply one of the most formidable and charismatic actors from the Golden Age.I suspect that most Americans would rather it was his face that remains an iconic image of their country than that of Mr Michael Moore.",The Cowboys

29,slokes,The Brady Bunch Meets The Wild Bunch,8,29 January 2008,"John Wayne led many a cattle drive, but there's something especially satisfying about this final turn on the trail, alongside ten young boys for what turns out to be a hardnosed yet winning salute to the Duke's legacy of manly comportment.""It's not how you're buried, it's how they remember you,"" Wayne's Wil Andersen tells one of his charges, the half-breed Cimarron (A Martinez), and ""The Cowboys"" is a two-hour rumination on that theme, of how Andersen, a man whose hard-bitten ways cost him two sons, finds a sort of redemption with these boys who come to help him take his cattle 400 miles to Belle Fourche while the only menfolk are either off panning for gold or else aiming to get their fortune in seedier ways.John Wayne in his post-Oscar years didn't have much to prove, and many of his movies from that time play today as little more than agreeable trips to the well. ""The Cowboys"" is different. Picking up on the rougher theme of post-""Wild Bunch"" westerns, it presents a modern sensibility where people swear and bleed profusely when shot or punched. Wayne might seem out of place, yet he finds the right balance here between his characteristic latter-day gruff humorousness and the sterner stuff we remember from his classic turns in ""Red River"" and ""The Searchers"".The key to Andersen are those dead sons he has buried out in his spread back home. ""They went bad on me,"" is about all he can say on the matter. ""Or I went bad on them. I can't figure it out."" Seen through that prism, everything Andersen does with his young cowboys makes a lot of sense, right down to the famously grim finale with Bruce Dern, whose memorable ""Long Hair"" is one of the great Wayne-movie villains.But there's a lot of joy in ""The Cowboys"", too. Another scene early on, just as classic, has Andersen deciding to give the boys a lesson with a wild mare, Crazy Alice, only to get taught a lesson in turn by these surprisingly spry youngsters, who each manage to prove themselves to Wil's wry chagrin.""I hope I haven't ridden all the rough off her!"" one offers as he hands back the reins.""You'll do,"" Wil replies, about all the affection he gives or they want.Then there's Jebediah Nightlinger, the cook and only other adult figure on the scene, who tries less hard than Wil to hide his enjoyment of the situation. Hard as it is to imagine ""The Cowboys"" without Wayne, it's harder to imagine it without Roscoe Lee Browne, whose every utterance has a quality of burnished bronze.Director Mark Rydell finds the right tempo and look for his film, aided by John Williams' stirring score and Robert Surtees' camera work. Every shot has the quality of a glossy Louis L'Amour cover, majestic pines and grassy hills stretching out into infinity.About the only thing keeping ""The Cowboys"" from classic status is an ending which, while satisfying, comes off very pat on reflection. Despite the long time we spend with them, many of the Cowboys themselves lack for individuality, an exception being Robert Carradine, who plays Slim the de facto leader of the kids, and is the real-life son of Wayne's ""Stagecoach"" co-star John Carradine.""The Cowboys"" wasn't Wayne's swansong, yet it's a stirring valedictory effort all the same, a chance to see an enduring screen legend at his late and glorious apex, showing a new generation, and generations yet unborn, a thing or two about getting it done.",The Cowboys

34,virek213,The Duke Makes Men Out Of Boys,8,3 February 2020,"You could disagree with his hard assed ""My country, right or wrong"" political views, and his appeals to patriotism that were not backed up with the same military service that so many of his generation, inside and outside of the film business, did in World War II. But even the most liberal filmgoers can't dispute that John Wayne was a Hollywood presence of the highest order, from his breakthrough film role in the 1939 John Ford classic STAGECOACH, to his final one as J.B. Books in the 1976 film THE SHOOTIST. The Western was the place where he showed much of his mettle; and although such films of his in the genre became more routine and arguably creaky and old-fashioned when he involved his own Batjac Company, he could occasionally step beyond that for something more. Perhaps the greatest case in point came in 1972, when he and the comparatively young director Mark Rydell got together to do THE COWBOYS.In this film, Wayne stars as Wil Andersen, a rancher who has to be able to deliver 1500 head of cattle to the town of Belle Fourche, a 400-mile ride across the Wyoming and Montana hinterlands. But all of his ranch hands have lit out for the California gold fields, and this puts him into a real bind. On the suggestion of his old friend Anse Petersen (Slim Pickens), although he initially scoffs at the notion, Wayne agrees to get a couple of dozen actual boys to help on this cattle drive. He also gets a hardened African-American cook (Roscoe Lee Browne, in a great role) to come along. But he does turn down a n'er-do-well named Asa Watts, or ""Long Hair"", a man with a criminal past played by none other than Bruce Dern...and therein hangs an infamous part of this early 1970s Western.Despite his disciplinarian ways, Wayne eventually makes men out of these boys; and they become Cowboys on this ride. This comes very much in hand when the group is once more confronted by Dern and his gang of cattle rustlers who have been trailing Wayne's team from the very beginning. What happens in this confrontation is something that had never happened to any Wayne character before, and which will really show how much the Cowboys have learned from their mentor.Rydell, who had directed the 1969 William Faulkner adaptation THE REIVERS, had originally wanted George C. Scott for the role of Wil Anderson, and was not sure he'd be able to get along with Wayne, whose politics went way far right from his. But being able to leave politics aside, the two got along quite well during filming; and it shows in Wayne's largely non-clichéd performance. Rydell also gets some solid work from the troop of young cowboys, including future stars Robert Carradine (son of John Carradine) and A. Martinez. Colleen Dewhurst also does a good turn as a madame who gets close to both Wayne and Browne. But even the ultra-iconic Wayne is nearly overshadowed by the savage villainy of Dern, whose penultimate scene with The Duke earned him a certain amount of infamy with the Duke's fan base that, even now in 2020, still hasn't quite relented yet (and which even affected the way his daughter Laura, who would eventually become a great actress all her own, played with her friends in her youth).There is a certain amount of violence in THE COWBOYS that kind of belies this film's 'PG' rating (it's arguably a 'PG-13' by today's standards), making it, along with BIG JAKE, among the most violent of the Duke's films. But the way Rydell directs Wayne and the cast, plus the superb cinematography of Robert Surtees (BEN HUR), and an early Copland-influenced score by John Williams (this, along with his score for THE REIVERS, was what bought Williams to the attention of Steven Spielberg), help make THE COWBOYS one of the great films in Wayne's canon, not to mention one that is radically different from most of those that he had made before in the Western genre, or that he was indeed making around that particular time in his late years.John Wayne may not have been the same man in the early 1970s that had had been over the previous thirty years, but THE COWBOYS clearly showed that he had a lot left to offer. As such, THE COWBOYS merits an '8' rating here.",The Cowboys
35,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Ladie and Gentlemen: Mr. John Wayne!,6,20 June 2008,"Almost in spite of itself, The Cowboys has taken its place among John Wayne's most beloved films. It wasn't always that way: When it was released in January of 1972, the film was widely criticized for appearing to promote the notion that boys become men through violence. From a politically correct perspective, this apparent message is arguably deplorable (and some interpreted the film's young fighters as a reflection of young draftees into the Vietnam war), but there's no denying that The Cowboys remains as invigorating as it ever was, no matter how dubious its thematic implications. Based on a novel by William Dale Jennings, and adapted with Jennings by the married screen writing team of Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr. (whose impressive credits include Hud, Hombre, and Norma Rae), the movie opens with aging ranch owner Wil Anderson (Wayne) desperate for ranch-hands to herd 1,500 head of cattle across 400 miles of dangerous territory. With no better options, he reluctantly hires boys from the local schoolhouse (including Robert Carradine in his screen debut), and an experienced, worldly-wise cook named Nightlinger (played to perfection by Roscoe Lee Browne) joins the cattle drive--the first black man the boys have ever seen. A Hollywood liberal who initially felt at odds with Wayne's right-wing politics, Mark Rydell (On Golden Pond) originally sought George C. Scott for the lead, but studio executives urged him to convince Wayne to take the role. It was a happy outcome for both, as Rydell directs Wayne with an enjoyable mixture of Old West humor and grizzled trail-hardiness, and The Cowboys is a top-drawer production with gorgeous cinematography (on location in Mexico and Colorado) by veteran cameraman Robert Surtees. Colleen Dewhurst appears briefly but memorably as the madam of a traveling troupe of prostitutes (in a scene often cut from earlier TV broadcasts and some home-video releases), and the young A Martinez (who would later star in several TV soap operas and the indie-hit Powwow Highway) makes a strong impression in a prominent supporting role. But the real reason for the film's lasting popularity is the hiss-worthy villainy of Bruce Dern (as ""Long Hair,"" leader of the rustlers), who earned a dubious place in movie history for his character's cheating approach to gun play. No matter how you interpret its themes of fatherly influence and justified vengeance, The Cowboys (later the basis of a short-lived TV series) is undeniably entertaining, dominated by Wayne's reliable presence and bolstered by a rousing, Copland-esquire score by John Williams.",The Cowboys

Oh and then the kids will kill all of these men.

Seriously, the only fun parts are how the kids catch the bad guys or seeing Lewis Skolnick(Robert Carradine) kill some bad guys or him riding a horse. I kept wanting him to say 'You know Gilbert...' or 'You know Booger...'. I would have loved for him to do his famous Lewis Skolnick laugh in front of the Duke and see the Duke's reaction to it. It also might have been cool if Ogre came out and yelled 'Nerds!!'. But I digress, the premise of this movie is ridiculous from the get go. John Wayne has no one to go on a cattle drive with, so he hires young kids to tame the cattle on this ride. For one thing, I get that the kids will make money and it will help their families, but some of the families of the kids would have said 'no, you'll get killed, you're not going.' Or some families of the kids would have said 'The money is good, but we need you to help around the house this summer.' Or some of the kids would have chickened out or some would have said screw this hard labor. That would have left Wayne with about 2 or 3 kids in the end. But somehow, every kid comes along on this ridiculous journey and all of their parents are cool with it and the writer even tries to justify it when the kids are leaving saying bye to their parents, as if every parent is okay with it in their own way that their kid is leaving for the summer to go on a death wish journey. Then on the trip, a couple of the kids encounter some very pretty prostitutes, so this movie should let the kids have fun with the prostitutes(can't show it of course, but why not, the movie needs to have some fun and some laughs), but no, good Ole Roscoe comes in and gives one of his usual monologue/sermons to the Madame about not to corrupt the kids please. Basically Roscoe is the BuzzKill of the movie. Everyone is always having a good time and then the minute Buzz Killington Roscoe comes onto the scene or says anything, everything stinks once again(like this movie). And does John Wayne really have to get shot and die the way he does? I mean, this film is just a complete buzzkill. John Wayne barely beats up the bad guy, then he walks away and the bad guy shoots him in the back, well not yet, first he shoots him in the arm, then in the leg, then in the other arm, then finally through the back through the chest, all in front of the kids by the way, hence the reason for the Little Rascals' Murderous killing spree, all for the revenge of The Duke(Something about Little kids killing for revenge and then laughing about it all, like little kids do, at the end of the film, just doesn't sit right in the stomach). But come on, did John Wayne really have to die like that. Couldn't the filmmaker just have him get shot in the back. Was it really necessary to make John Wayne suffer? Was really any of it necessary, any of this movie? It would have been better if John Wayne just stayed on the ranch with his woman, waiting until next year to take the herd of cattle out, and that would have been a more interesting film then what I saw. But what I saw was a ridiculous movie from beginning to end.",The Cowboys
38,garyldibert,Another John Wayne Classic,8,28 January 2007,"John Wayne made so many classic western movies and this one was another one that you could add to his list. John Wayne plays the role of rancher Wil Anderson, Rosco Lee Browne plays the role of the chuck wagon cook and Bruce Dern plays the role as the ex con Asa Watts. Wil Anderson has a problem! He needs to take his cattle to market that's 400 miles away an his hire help walks out on him. Therefore, Anderson has to look else where for help and turns to 11 greenhorn schoolboys to help get his cattle to slaughter before winter. Enters Jedediah Nightlinger who's job is to make sure that the boys are well fed while on there journey. Asa Watts shows up with some friends looking for work and is turned away by Anderson.

I'd seen lot's of John Wayne's films that are really great (Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Searchers, The Quiet Man and the Ford Trilogy) but for years I thought people made too much of his persona. I always said, ""he's playing John Wayne!"" Now I finally realize, what's wrong with that? His films hold up, and they hold up well. To me, The Cowboys is his best film. It has everything going for it. It is based on a book by William Dale Jennings who co-wrote the excellent script with Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank. It's a terrific western, it's a terrific 'coming of age' film. Surtees' cinematography is breathtaking, Mark Rydell doesn't miss a beat and keeps it moving at a perfect pace. The cast is so perfect and their acting is superb from the Cowboys themselves (many first time actors), support from Slim Pickens, Colleen Dewhurst and particularly Roscoe Lee Brown, one of the vilest villains ever in Bruce Dern and of course John Wayne in probably his best role ever. Add John Williams' rousing score and you have a film that is perfection. If you don't tear up or get a lump in your throat, then you're not human.",The Cowboys
41,BJJManchester,Unlikely but Entertaining,6,17 April 2006,"Latter day John Wayne western,an unofficial reworking of the vastly superior RED RIVER(1948)only this time with a strong juvenile flavour.The basic story of Wayne recruiting naive schoolboys for an arduous Cattle Drive never really rings true,but it is pleasantly photographed and decently acted by Wayne,his 'cowboys',and most especially Roscoe Lee Browne.Browne's suave and witty countenance is easily the film's highlight,though Wayne's performance is almost as good.Off-screen,the two actors were poles apart politically(Wayne a right-wing hawk,Browne a left-leaning-liberal),but relations apparently were surprisingly cordial when the cameras weren't running,and this is evident in the fine chemistry between them on-screen.There is some effective comedy relief,but several points mitigate against the film.One is as mentioned,the plot;Bruce Dern,as he sometimes tended to do,goes somewhat over the top as the cowardly and sadistic villain Longhair,and several scenes have a dubious and queasy ambiance about them,especially involving a troupe of prostitutes (led by Colleen Dewhurst)and a finale which strains credulity to absolute snapping point,and is morally very questionable.Also,there's a nice character part for reliable Westerner Slim Pickens;his scenes with the Duke are very enjoyable,but they are all too brief and his role in the film is far too short.Still,also despite the presence of too much sentiment(evident as well in Wayne's CAHILL US MARSHAL the following year,inevitable with the inclusion of schoolboys),the Duke's sheer star quality carries it through;watch out for his visit to his son's graves for a superb piece of acting,not done with any speech but entirely with facial expressions;this touching scene is possibly the best moment in the film.",The Cowboys
42,marxsarx,Symbolizes The End of The Era of The American Western,7,10 May 2004,"The Cowboys:  There is something bittersweet about the Cowboys.  It symbolizes the end of an era, the era of the western movie. It pays homage to its greatest star who symbolized it more than any other, John Wayne.John Wayne's dominance at the box office was coming to an end.  The movie itself has an air about it that something is dying, of looking back on a bygone era or time and of of a new generation replacing it... and what was dying was actually the western movie as a popular type of American movie. John Wayne's character Will Anderson was dead by the end of The Cowboys. It's symbolic that Will Anderson the character as well as John Wayne the actor had his glory days behind him. A generation that that would do things differently and who mostly had never seen one of John Wayne's early black and white western movies was now in the saddle.  Western movies were becoming an anomaly by 1972 as were mega stars such as John Wayne.   
It's also symbolic that we hear John Wayne cursing on screen in the Cowboys, ending the more innocent time in movies when this was unacceptable and certainly not in westerns.  It's a sad milestone.  
********* MILD SPOILERS AHEAD *******The Cowboys is a story about a man who ends up with only a bunch of boys instead of grown men to help him on his cattle drive.  He help them become men and contemplates his own life along the way.  John Wayne is better than ever.  Fresh off his Oscar win for True Grit, John Wayne was his usual brilliant self.  There are some true John Wayne moments in this film that nobody can pull off like he can.  One of my favorites is when John Wayne is sitting in the school room while one of the boys is stumbling through trying to read a passage.  His character Will Anderson rolls his eyes just a little while never breaking a smile.  It's a classic scene and terrific stuff.  John Wayne had amazing comic timing.Alas, the director, Mark Rydell, seemed to force too many of the scenes and situations so that by the end of The Cowboys, everything had a bit of a contrived feel to it along with feeling a bit heavy handed and preachy.  The Cowboys is an average movie that was based on a great idea with a great star.  Mark Rydell went on to direct one of the best movies ever in my estimation which is on Golden Pond with Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda. I only wish the director had just a bit more experience when he had done The Cowboys with Wayne.  This mediocre movie would have been golden in the hands of a John Huston or John Ford.    The score, by John Williams is said to be marvelous on the movie packaging. I couldn't disagree more and I found it very bland.  Once again, a person involved in this film, John William, went on to do much better stuff.  I just saw Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone with a John Williams score. Now that was a marvelous score!All in all, The Cowboys is worth watching to see John Wayne in one of his twilight performances.  Not one of Wayne's best, but an interesting part of his movie career.  I gave it a 7 out of 10, or a C -. 
Another film from fairly late in John Wayne's film anthology that I would recommend more highly is The Comancheros from 1961.  That one is a crowd pleaser.",The Cowboys
43,doug-balch,Doesn't work,3,9 July 2010,"This is one of the lesser of Wayne's post-1960 canon.Here's what I liked:Wayne is solid as usual. I was very surprised when he was shot to death three quarters of the way through the movie. This was very effective.Bruce Dern turns in a good performance as the heavy. although his character is too melodramatic.Here's what was not so good:I didn't buy into the basic coming of age premise. I was completely bored from the opening shot of the movie until Bruce Dern's gang showed up to rustle the cattle.Although the movie picked up with the appearance of the Dern gang and was certainly interesting when Wayne died, it lapsed into implausible absurdity when the boys attacked the rustlers.The musical score was overbearing and pretentious. Did all ten cattle rustlers deserve to be summarily executed? After all, it was Dern alone who shot Wayne. Maybe some of the rustlers weren't really bad guys, just down on their luck Joe's with families to support. Just sayin'.",The Cowboys
44,sbox,Fine Western Serves as Rite of Passage Film,7,18 May 2000,"WARNING:  May Contain Spoilers""The Cowboys"" serves up traditional western values in gritty reality.  John Wayne acts as Wil Andersen, the hard pressed livestock owner who needs to get his cattle to market.  All of his ranch hands have deserted him, leaving him with 1500 head of cattle that he can't support through the winter.Well meaning, Anse, played by Slim Pickens reluctantly convinces Andersen that local schoolboys can manage the job the ""menfolk"" have abandoned by chasing gold dreams.Andersen is a recalcitrant taskmaster, not happy with taking on boys, a mexican and a black cookie, expertly played by Roscoe Lee Browne.As the drive progresses, we see Andersen become more comfortable with his band of misfits.Disgruntled ex-cons track the green trailhands and calamity ensues.  When Andersen is incapacitated, the young cowboys seek to finish the job and exact revenge.All told, ""The Cowboys"" is a fine movie, although the boys actions against the rustlers is somewhat cheesy.

Its simple, straightforward and generous with its emotions without resorting to smaltz. John Wayne in one of his last roles, Bruce Dern as Evil Incarnate, the beautiful Colleen Dewhurst smiles - its a generous film to a fault.

48,MovieMan-112,A Fine and Entertaining Western... Even If You're Not A Fan of John Wayne Movies!,9,9 August 1999,"I, myself, am not a big fan of John Wayne movies. I find his war films too patriotic and one-sided. His older westerns from the 30's and 40's are very boring and out-of-date. This film is one of the best John Wayne films ever because it is not your usual ""shoot-em-up"" western where the good guy always wins. It's a realistic tale of an aging rancher (John Wayne) who must bring a herd of cattle 400 miles through rough western territory to a town called Bellfush and all of his cowhands that worked for him have deserted him in pursuit of gold. So the Duke finds 11 schoolboys (the oldest boys are 15 years old) who volunteer to be cowhands on the big cattle drive out west. The rancher laughs to himself and thinks that the boys can't manage such a demanding job due to their ages but agrees to train them and accept them anyway. So Wayne, along with the 11 boys and a black cook, embark on a tremendous unforgettable journey through western territory. The film never rushes into anything and the first hour builds very good character structure in order for the viewer to get to know everyone and have the viewer see what it takes to participate in a long, challenging cattle drive. Then there's trouble when a group of bad men (led by Bruce Dern, in one of the most sadistic villain roles since Henry Fonda's performance in ""Once Upon A Time In The West) see the perfect opportunity to make themselves rich by trying to steal the cattle from just ""an old man and 11 little boys"". They attempt to steal all of the the cattle and tragedy occurs, defying the classic western rule of a ""happily ever after ending."" Then it's up to the ""cowboys"" to see that justice be served in the west as they set out to complete the job that was asked of them. A job that has turned these 11 schoolboys into real honorable men. It is truly a unique western.",The Cowboys
49,tohu,An under-rated gem,8,28 April 2018,"I've just watched this remarkable movie for the first time in years, and loved every minute of it. I remember seeing it when I was a boy of similar age to those in the film, and I got a lot out of it - but didn't really understand some scenes. Now as an adult, those are the scenes I like best! 
Many of the reviews here talk about the performance of Roscoe Brown, and rightly so, but for me Bruce Dern steals the show. One of the best movie villains, who meets with one of the most satisfying movie comeuppances.
And while other reviewers praise the cameo performance of Colleen Dewhurst - again rightly - I want to mention the other woman in the film, Sarah Cunningham as Annie Andersen, the wife of John Wayne's character. It's a much more subtle performance and she doesn't have much screen time, but the gentle chemistry between the couple is so good; and we find out so much about them, and about their marriage. Wayne's own performance is terrific. . . 
Overall the film is full of surprises. You think it is going to be fairly predictable but it repeatedly takes a different turn. Very dark in places, moving in others and then laugh-out-loud funny too. 
At 2hrs 11 minutes it could perhaps have been trimmed a little, but still it's an under-rated gem of a movie.",The Cowboys
50,npdeo18,Duke is the best,8,15 August 2015,It was a great pleasure to see Duke enacting such a role than the usual roles of a cowboy. The supporting cast by Roscoe Lee Browne as a part of the crew and the schoolboys to drive the cattle drive were amazing and fun to watch. The way John Wayne guided those schoolboys were worth watching and funny as well especially the stutter scene. Meanwhile the role enacted by Bruce Dern as criminal/bandit is definitely praise worthy and it was encouraging to see him in a duel with the Duke. It would have been great to see him enacting the role of Bond Villain. At the same time of the scenes were quite emotional especially the scene before Duke's death was quite emotional and touching. Overall the film along with The Shootist is one of the best films of John Wayne in his career end. Even if a remake is made no one would be able to match up Duke in this role.,The Cowboys
51,ChrisinDesMoines,Best John Wayne movie EVER,10,12 March 2021,"I've often said that Quigley Down Under is what sparked my interest in watching western's but it was watching this one that solidified my embracement of the genre.Wayne got a best actor for True Grit and that is far from my favorite Wayne movie. I can list several that came out long before where he deserved an Oscar and a few later in which he deserved one and this is clearly one of the later ones. According to the commentary on the DVD, Mark Rydell wanted George C. Scott to play the role of Will Anderson, but Wayne begged Rydell to allow him to play the role saying ""I won't let you down, sir"" and I can see why Wayne wanted this role so badly.Plot wise the story is truly unique for the genre and still continues to be unique nearly half a century later, and the more you watch the movie the more details you pick up that were pretty subtle regarding the relationship he had with his two deceased boys. Reluctant to take on young boys (literally boys he hired straight from school) its all he could find and as the movie progresses you see him becoming less of a ""employer"" and more of a father figure to them. By the end of the movie you see that he is more interested in protecting them than he is making sure that his cattle safely gets to market, but in doing so he guides these boys into young men who are better able to face the hardships of living in the old west.Acting in this is great from Wayne on down to the youngest boy, many of whom were barely teenagers when this was filmed.I saw this movie for the first time about 30 years ago and has been a staple of my movie collection ever sense. It's not uncommon to see it available to watch for free on various streaming providers like The Roku Channel or Tubi TV, but this movie is definitely worth the purchase price. Cinematography is excellent, sound score really adds some depth to this movie (John Williams proves in this film why he is the best person to score a movie) and the ending will bring even the hardest of hearts to tears.In my book, this is a must see movie, even if you don't like the genre because the plot is that strong. Might not be appropriate for some pre-teen kids, but I suspect that most kids, especially boys, will sit through the entire movie because much of it is told from their point of view. Some things that parents may find offensive, Will Anderson (Wayne) hires a black cook (Roscoe Lee Brown) and when the boys see him for the first time they ask some personal questions regarding how much of his skin is that color and uses a derogatory word, but not as an insult. While traveling they come across some prostitutes' and Nightlinger (Brown) asks the ladies to not tempt the boys into something that they ain't ready for yet. Another scene has the boys stealing the sour mash from the chuckwagon and getting drunk but getting discovered and suffering with hangovers the following morning.Despite the issues listed above, the movie handles these situations with both honesty and finesse, challenges that adults must deal with when bringing up boys and not just as a running gag or comedic effect.",The Cowboys
52,kcterrell-25046,A Fun Four Hours,8,27 May 2018,"A rag-tag group of young teenagers volunteer to help John Wayne get his 1500 head of cattle to market, 400 miles away, and Wayne is stuck in a jam because all of his hired hands get the gold fever and run off. Faced with bills and the habit of driving his cattle every summer, Wayne takes on the role of drive master, mentor, teacher, and father to the lot of them. And the inexperienced teens prove resourceful and reliable, maturing quickly on the dusty trail. OK, none of the young actors in the film went on to any big Hollywood success. But, their limited acting skills actually added to the schtick of the set-up.Trailed and eventually ambushed by rustlers, the kids lose Wayne and their herd in a flurry of bullets that put the Duke in the grave. An endearing drive cook, Roscoe Lee Brown (cudos) steps up as the step-father of the crew, and the boys go after the rustlers to retrieve the herd in memory of Wayne.A good story, solid writing, and on-site cinematography make the movie, with Wayne's performance, of course. Direction is subpar, especially with the typical Hollywood intentional gaffs. The rustler gang consists of nine men, but after the boys ambush and kill four of them, there are suddenly ten members of the gang coming after them. It's annoying that directors want the viewer absorbed into the visual tale, but also to forgive the inconsistencies and the details. At some points along the drive, it looks like Wayne is really driving 1500 head. At other times, it looks like the entire herd is about 80 cattle, and at other times, it appears to consist of maybe 200 head. This kind of laziness in direction only serves to distract the viewer.All in all, a deserving film, with a young Bruce Dern playing a really, really bad outlaw. A typical Western prop character that you can really hate if you are into the action.A worthwhile two hours spent with a good film despite some flaws.",The Cowboys
53,georgeredding,The teacher Dusty Britches,9,27 March 2021,"This particular western from Warner Brothers may not be one of Wayne's best, but it is exciting and entertaining, and in a sense different from most of the ""Duke""'s horse operas. In the story, sometime after the Civil War, a few of his hands quit to go to work for him after they hear about a gold boom in Montana (?). After that, having no choice but to do so, he hires a bunch of school boys, but not without reminding that they are definitely BOYS, not men, and, he says that he is going to remind them of that every day. Ans so as he also says ""...school begins as they must drive cattle to Belle Fouche. It's enough to say that while he is rough most of the time, he comes to be respected by those boys.The cast is for certain just right for this western. There's Wayne, there's the same old country/man Slim Pickens, there's Roscoe Lee Browne who plays the cook in this movie, there's the ever-typical mean outlaw Bruce Dern, and there is Sarah Cunningham who plays Wane's sweet, soothing wife.The movie has an exciting ending, and the boys might surprise ending. Again, it's not one of Wayne's best, but it is ever bit as exciting.",The Cowboys
54,bard-32,Not as good as the book,10,18 January 2008,"I remember listening to the book, The Cowboys, on an LP. So I'm dating myself here. Remember LPs, also known as records? The New Hampshire State Library had a program where it sent out ""talking books"" on records and tapes, to people who are blind. This was in the '70s when there was no such thing as books on tape. But I digress, now back to the subject. The Cowboys is about Wil Andersen, a Texas cattle rancher who has a thousand head of cattle to move to the railheads at Kansas City, Missouri, so they can go to Chicago to be slaughtered. Why were cattle moved from Texas to Kansas City? It had to do with the Civil War. There was a shortage of cattle after the Civil War. So men like Charles Goodnight, (yes, that's really his name,) the inventor of the Chuck wagon, was the originator of the cattle drive. This was during the Era of the Cowboy. The years between 1865, the end of the Civil War, and 1890, the closing of the frontier, was known as ""the Wild West."" It was at this time that the American cowboy appeared on the scene. Wil Andersen couldn't find people to drive his cattle to Kansas City so his wife suggested that he hire boys. Is he ready to go on the cattle drive? No, not yet. He still needs a chuck wagon and a driver. That's why he hired ex-slave Jebediah Nightlinger to cook for him. Are they there yet? No, but they're on the way. Andersen and his cowboys have to fight Indians and rustlers. The rustlers are led by Bruce Dern, the father of actress Laura Dern, as a young man. This, and other movies of that decade, were the last Westerns until the 1980s. Why? Because Star Wars took over four years later and by 1977, they were pronouncing the Western dead.",The Cowboys

The story is gullible but entertaining with a very good script and fine acting by all the actors especially the boys.Bruce Dern is chilling as the villain.The outdoor shooting is superb and the music lends to it.I have seen many of Wayne's movies and though his political leanings are evident there is something about his presence that appeals to common sense and being a MAN.",The Cowboys
56,ppilf,Should have received multiple Academy Award nominations,10,14 December 2020,"This is one of my favorite movies, even though I'm not a huge fan of westerns (I like them, just not a huge fan). But this is one of the very best. In fact I still can't believe that this movie didn't receive any Academy Award nominations. I think that was a terrible unjust snub. There was certainly stiff movie competition in 1972, but this film should have received multiple nominations; at least in directing and music.Everything about this movie was absolutely superb; directing, casting, acting, music, cinematography, action scenes, screenplay, dialog, story, everything; that's all I can say. It's simply one of the greats. But I do think the directing, story, and music are exceptional, and the acting outstanding. The only thing one might be concerned with is that it does contain some moderately serious violence. But that's part of realism in great films, and there is much much worse violence in many other films. Some critics have criticized the revenge aspect of the story as violence gratification, and a bad crutch. But I'm not so sure of that; for me the jury's still out on that.Everybody refers to John Wayne movies in a category of their own since he was such a huge star. So I'm going to do the same: my favorite John Wayne movies in order are: 1) The Shootist (1976), 2) The Cowboys (1972), 3) True Grit (1969), 4) Rooster Cogburn (1975), 5) The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence (1962), and 5) North to Alaska (1960). As for John Wayne himself, I didn't agree with most of his politics, and I didn't like many of his early movies or his early acting. But I became a big fan of both his movies and his acting in his later career. During that period he was one of our greatest movie stars.If you haven't seen this movie, see it! Otherwise you will miss what I think is one of the great experiences in movie arts that this industry has to offer.",The Cowboys
57,sailor-28,Boys do manage to turn into men when properly led and handled!,8,26 June 1999,"This film was my favorite John Wayne entertainment film, that centers around the subject of males growing up.  The rigors of life and realities of death, play their parts in forming an overwhelming impression about growth.  Many young men experience disillusion and question the validity of the adage, ""Growing up means that one has attained the discipline to follow orders"". These boys, who played as John Waynes' trail hands on a cattle drive, had to learn to overcome the simplest obstacles on an on-going basis.  The role played by Roscoe Lee Browne as the cook, was refreshing and superbly handled.  It served to create an example of how an education could build confidence and self-assurance to serve one through difficult times.  It was obvious he was the most educated, and served to share the leadership of turning boys into men.  Bruce Dern's role as the longhair villain was well done.  The make-up of looking beat up and mean helped the character a little, but Bruce Dern could have managed the scene with a little less of of it.  Let's face it - Bruce Dern is an accomplished villain actor.If you are seeking a womans' contribution in the film, it came in the form of artificial grace. John Wayne's Wife, Coleen Dewhurst; along with the madame; and the school teacher, demonstrated the behavior standards that were presumed in effect in different times.  The reality was that this standard was a total myth.  Women rode the emotional merry-go-round promoted by oppression back in the 1800's and didn't always express theirselves so graceful. Women without education were just as mannerless as men. The list of ""faux pas"" in the film could be found in the shooting scenes.  One scene, a boy is killed when the cow herd becomes spooked by a horse and rider.  Two other scenes, while a shootout was taking place, most all the cow hands are presumed to be in the scene and it's funny to learn that the shooting didn't spook the herd off into a wild stampede.  Some scenes did refer to the black character, Jedediah Nightlinger, using the ""N"" word, which edited out in televised versions of the film.  It is left in the video. This film, for a 1972 production, did typify the 1972 man in the 1840's or pre-civil war era.  It was not authentic 1840 drama.",The Cowboys
58,tightspotkilo,Coming of Age Story,8,26 July 2015,"People say (and write) many things about this movie, most commonly that it's some sort of a ""message"" movie, or allegory, about the war in Vietnam. Whether it is or isn't (and I say it isn't), it doesn't matter a whit. The movie stands on its own merits as (1) a fine movie, (2) a John Wayne movie --one of his last, (3) telling a good story, (4) a coming-of-age story, (5) with fine acting all the way around. In addition to The Duke, we have Roscoe Lee Browne playing the role of cook and philosopher, charming, dignified, and charismatic, and Bruce Dern, occupying the role and position of probably the all-time most evil ""bad guy"" villain in cinematic westerns history, and Dern more than delivers the goods. Through it all, the movie remains a coming of age story for the ages, and the proof is in the fact that it stands up well, even now, 43 years after its release.I believe the controversy stems from the fact that it's a John Wayne movie, and he was a known hawk when it came to the war. So people read into that what they want to read into that. But simple logic dictates otherwise, that this movie is not about the war. Wayne would never have participated in an anti-war film, so that rules that out. And Bruce Dern and director Mark Rydell were both known for their liberal and anti-war politics, and would not have signed on to a pro-war movie. Ergo, the movie was not making any kind of direct and intentional statement about the war, for or against. It's a bit ironical for me personally that the film carries with it that pro Vietnam war or anti Vietnam war controversy, either way (and people say both things about it). I was in Japan on R&R from Vietnam when I saw this movie in the Spring of 1972, in a Japanese theater amusingly dubbed into Japanese with English subtitles. To this day I still don't know why they did that. Why not just Japanese subtitles? But the buzz about the movie at the time was not that it was pro-war or anti-war, and I never heard any such theory like that until many years later. The only popular buzz about this movie in 1972 had to do with the nature and fact of the demise of John Wayne's character.",The Cowboys
59,WandrinStar,The Cowboys (1972),7,16 January 2012,"(7.5/10) Along with the Shootist, ranks as the best of the latter day John Wayne films. After his Oscar win in True Grit wrapped up his legacy as an American icon, his dozen or so films he did afterwards were more celebratory to his career as a whole. The theme of passing the torch to a younger generation is echoes in The Cowboys, and is a welcomed change to the typical Duke Western. Roscoe Lee Browne has an extremely memorable performance as the chef, and the Cowboys themselves were charming including the debut performance by Robert Carradine. Bruce Dern has never really impressed me, but he does a great job portraying the film's villainous coward. Director Mark Rydell did a fine job, but would have liked to see a marque director at the helm. Loved the ending and the movie in general.",The Cowboys
60,John-ridley33,John Ford Classic but flawed,10,15 March 2020,"I have watched ""Fort Apache"" many, many times on the big screen, television, video and DVD and have always enjoyed every moment, but no one has been able to explain how it was that the four sergeants, Mulcahy (Victor McLaglen) Quincannon (Dick Foran) Schattuck (Jack Pennick) and Beaufort (Pedro Armandaris - the one who will forever be known as the actor who committed suicide during the filming of the Bond film ""From Russia With Love"") - knew of the arrival of 2nd Lt. Michael Shannon O'Rourke (John Agar) yet his parents, Sgt.Maj. Michael O'Rourke (Ward Bond) and his mother, Mary O'Rourke (Irene Rich) were taken with surprise when their son arrived at Fort Apache.
In addition, there are several scenes where a young, recently married, Shirley Temple is clearly seen wearing a bra when in fact although the film is set in 1870, the brassiere was not invented until November 1914. Until then women wore a camisole of sorts which would not enhance their bust.",The Cowboys
61,chriswright1969,"I wouldn't make it a habit of calling me that, son",9,20 June 2020,"John Wayne is a joy to watch in The Cowboys as a cantankerous rancher who is forced to employ schoolkids to complete his cattle drive. He's stubborn and stern, but also fatherly and self reflective. The Cowboys is a coming-of-age version in the western format. The Duke clashes violently with Seventies greatest psychopath: Bruce Dern. As the despicable villain, Bruce Dern made an unforgettable impression on me by doing the improbable: killing John Wayne.For me, The Cowboys is a more fitting testament for Wayne than True Grit (1969) or The Shootist (1976). A film career that spanned 5 decades. It's also the only true Seventies style western that The Duke has ever starred in. Today's sensitivities may find the morale and the violent conclusion of The Cowboys unsettling. The Duke becomes one with the land and the torch is passed on to a new (but different) generation.For those who don't like the demise of Wayne in The Cowboys, they can always take comfort in the more heroic epitaph he did 4 years later in The Shootist. This would indeed be John Wayne's final film. The only difference is that while The Shootist is a good western, The Cowboys is a great one.",The Cowboys
62,mlouns,A surprisingly tough Western with good acting,7,30 December 2005,"""The Cowboys"" gives a solid performance by John Wayne, with excellent support from Roscoe Lee Browne and especially Bruce Dern.John Wayne plays his role well as the aging rancher who needs to get his herd on the trail and has trouble finding help. He shows softer moments than is typical for him, and seems almost wistful at times.The supporting cast of about a dozen boys who end up helping him do a pretty good job as well. When the film gets under way, the boys make you think you are in for a relatively smooth ride, but some of the later scenes get pretty intense.Browne has the somewhat trite role of a wisdom-dispensing African-American, but he does have some good lines that he does well with. Whereas many films today might downplay the issue of his skin color, ""The Cowboys"" has fairly realistic reactions from a variety of people to a black man working in the West.Bruce Dern comes off as one of the creepiest bad guys in a Western. In early scenes his (unnamed) character tries to pass himself off as smooth and sweet-talking, but eventually his true colors show, and he is downright scary. He has an especially frightening confrontation with one of the boys, and a wild-eyed showdown with John Wayne that really cements him as one of the worst bad guys ever played in a Western.The story is pretty much by the book, with only one big surprise in a fight near the end. It also takes a little while to get going, but by the first scene with the boys in the corral, it hums along.On the whole, a good Western with some excellent acting.",The Cowboys
63,stevenlshoup,C'mon. We're Burnin' Daylight.,10,25 March 2006,"An engrossing Coming-Of-Age story and a rollicking good western to boot! Wil Anderson (John Wayne), a 60 year old cattle rancher is ready to herd his stock to Belle Fouche, but ""gold fever"" has struck the able-bodied men in his community, so Anderson is left with three choices: Herd the cattle alone; fore-go until next year and leave himself and his wife pauperized; or whip 11 boys from ages 9 through 15 into ridin', ropin' and ranchin' cattle-hands to get his livestock to market. He opts for the third choice and what happens next is as entertaining a tale as the old west could ever provide.Having lost his own two sons (""They went bad. Or I did . . . I'm not sure which,"") from the outset Anderson is ill at ease in the company of 11 virginal children, more at home playing cowboy than being one and his solution is to treat them as men so that they grow up quick and keep him from losing his income. Adding to his troubles is an untried cook named Jebediah Nightlinger, a world-wise man of the plains who happens to be black -- something new to everyone on the ride.The script is well written and never boring. The dialogue and performances are uniformly enjoyable all around. Watching these school kids turn from babies into men as they are introduced to a world with unforgiving weather, hazardous terrain, their first experience with Tennessee Sour Mash, death, treachery, and cattle rustling is a sight to behold. And as the youngsters become men, Wil Anderson, in his own rough and awkward way, is able to become the father he failed to achieve with his own sons.There is a quaint and delicately restrained scene involving two of the boys stumbling upon a traveling troupe of prostitutes, headed up by Kate, an older Madam seamlessly played by the late, great Colleen Dewhurst. You can't help but smile at the entire delicious interplay between boys and girls; Nightlinger and Kate.But every deck has a joker and in this story it is Long Hale, played with wild-eyed psychotic subtlety by the exceptional Bruce Dern. Anderson knows a vicious criminal when he sees one and Hale is the dictionary definition in Wil's book. Anderson refuses to hire Hale and his ""friends"" for the cattle ride. Better done with the school boys. But Hale has a surprise in store for Wil. He's following the cattle ride and plans to rustle the herd away from Anderson. What kind of resistance will 11 kids have against a gang of over a dozen seasoned killers""? Directed with consummate skill by the brilliant and unheralded Mark Rydell (the man also responsible for The Reivers and On Golden Pond), he bathes the film in rich russets, dark and supple browns, creamy beige, and captures the dusty plains, the sparse autumn woodlands, the cow hides, horse flesh, leather, ropes, and tumbleweeds of the Old West with an almost pastoral beauty. This picture is gorgeous to look at! John Williams contributes a vibrant and energetic score (what else would you expect?) with a harmonica's drawl and wail that let's you know Long Hale isn't far away.Wayne is just right as Anderson. He sort of softens his John Wayne persona for the role and hits all the right notes. But it is Roscoe Lee Browne who stands out in this film. He is the brightest penny in a cast full of bright pennies. He, too forges a bond with the boys in the moment of everyone's darkest hour through his understanding that they've become men worthy of his respect and praise and, while he may not be able to achieve a surrogate father role, he becomes their trusted uncle and one of them.How the boys resolve the theft of the cattle herd and exact a fitting justice on the evil Long Hale is nothing short of brilliant. And the arrival of the cattle into Belle Fouche is almost tear producing as the town and we the viewers understand the price of manhood.This is not a western for pre-teens or younger. The language is rough and Nightlinger is referred to by the ""N"" word frequently. But for teens and older, this is a great introduction to John Wayne, Roscoe Lee Browne, and westerns in general. It is also a chance to get to know the work of one of Hollywood's true great contemporary directors, Mark Rydell. I would love to tell you more but, as Nightlinger points out at a key moment in this film, ""I have the inclination. I have the maturity. I have the where-with-all. Sadly, I do not have the time.""

Forgiveness isn't in me.Roscoe Lee Brown was amazing in this movie. His acting. His voice. His delivery. It doesn't get any better. ""I regret trifling with married women. I'm thoroughly ashamed at cheating at cards. I deplore my occasional departures from the truth. Forgive me for taking your name in vain, my Saturday drunkenness, my Sunday sloth. Above all, forgive me for the men I've killed in anger............ and those I am about to."" Those words still send a chill down my spine.I've watched it dozens of times; it never gets old. I have a photo of Wayne and the boys on my wall. I was shocked when John Wayne was killed. Simply dumbstruck. I couldn't believe it. But I cheered out loud when the boys killed the bad guys. And I cried and laughed when they couldn't find his grave at the end. Still do, 50 years later.""We're burning daylight.""""It's not how you're buried. It's how you're remembered.

65,dancc,One of The Dukes best performances,10,15 September 2015,"**Possible Spoilers** (Come on, it's over 40 years old, what are you waiting for?)I'll start by admitting that I am a John Wayne fan. I'll also say I'm not a fan of his politics. I don't say that to start an argument, I say it so it's clear I like him as an actor, not as a symbol.Now that that's out of the way I have to say that I consider THE COWBOYS to be one of his best performances (it's on a par with THE SEARCHERS & THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE). THE COWBOYS shows Wayne at his most emotionally accessible. He's still playing the stoic westerner, but we see him with his wife (who loves him, but clearly knows he's a pigheaded bastard) & we see him playing his age. Not like in TRUE GRIT where he played ""old"", but simply playing his actual age (65, which in1876, was pretty damn old). And he clearly had a genuine rapport with young men he was working with.I also have to say that to some degree this film turns the ""John Wayne"" ethos on it's head. I know a lot of people think this film shows The Duke turning the kids into little versions of himself. But I think the most important moment in the film is when the kids finally bring the cattle into Belle Fourche. They've killed the rustlers who killed their leader (& father figure). And they've accomplished what they promised to do. But none of them look pleased with themselves. They aren't riding tall in the saddle. They are beaten down, worn out, & depressed. They've ""done what a mans gotta do"", but it hasn't made them happy or proud. Quite the opposite. They have clearly lost something in the acts of violence they have done, no matter how necessary some of them may have been. A lot of people use the cliché ""coming of age"" when referring to this film. I think the better cliché would be ""loss of innocence"". I also want to respond to a reviewer (who was writing in 2003, but, what the hell) who said he thought Roscoe Lee Browne was ""better"" than John Wayne in the film. I am an actor myself & I bow before the altar of Mr. Browne. I would kill (well, let's not get crazy here) a close acquaintance just for his voice. (He did an episode of BARNEY MILLER that I highly recommend to everyone). And he is absolutely wonderful in THE COWBOYS. But I think he & Wayne owe each other a thanks for making each other better. The chemistry between the two of them is unbelievable. If you want to chalk it up to their political differences, feel free. Frankly, to me, it just looks like a couple actors having a great time working with each other. Apparently, the scene where Browne tosses the knife at Wayne's hand when he's reaching for a piece of pie was improvised (Wayne didn't know it was going to happen). But Duke ran with it, & it's a great moment.I've already written too much. To anyone who has not seen this film, watch it. Set all your presumptions aside, & watch it on it's own terms. I think you'll love it",The Cowboys

Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the movie. The kids in the movie were average but could have been cast better.

One of the most endearing performances by the tough old man that is John Wayne.You might recognize a few young faces in the mix. This film is okay for kids, up the high side of a horses shank. I'm not sure what that means but it sounds good. Above 6 years old is fine. What they don't understand you'll tell 'em.The racial component is thrown in with a black gentleman named ""Mr. Nightlinger"". He will be the intellect on the journey.

68,fredww,A great story of the west,10,20 July 2013,"This movie portrays an aging cattleman working with young boys to drive his cattle herd to market. The interaction between the rancher, the boys, the cook (excellently played by Roscoe Lee Brown) and the villains all fit together well and quite believable.This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Not only is it a great movie, it presents John Wayne in one of his best roles. While it has been six decades since I was the age of the boys portrayed in this movie, I still identify with the feelings expressed by them in their roles.It is a straight story with no hidden agenda. Other reviewers have summarized the story quite well, so I won't go into detail here. The story is not likely to have actually occurred, even in part, in the old west. But it is believable enough that it could have. There is sympathy, action and, and best of all, good character development. There are villains, good guys and heroes. The story line weaves it all together very well.There are no pyrotechnics nor any great special effects. The message is in the dialog and interaction amongst the characters. There is something else that happens in this movie that few other movies include. It has a few throw-away scenes that add to the viewers enjoyment, but don't necessarily affect the theme of the story. One such occurrence is early in the film when Will Anderson explains the struggle between two bulls in the cattle herd.This is a well done movie topped off with a great John Williams score. i recommend it to everyone of all ages.",The Cowboys

It moves slowly, does not engage the viewer emotionally in the lives of the characters and quickly descends into completely pointless violence. The scene in which John Wayne's main character is killed makes no sense, with the entire group of boys impassively standing by and watching their mentor be slowly shot to death.

Roscoe Lee Brown as the courtly, elder-statesman cookie is priceless. Bruce Dern was again cast in the familiar role of the nerdy, crazy villain that he did so effectively all through his career. Well, this is a movie for the guys, a typical male weepy that makes much of macho stoicism (can anyone actually believe the way Andersen keeps getting up as he is shot first in the arm, then in the leg, then in the other leg, etc.) and glorifies the boys' first foray into binge drinking while protecting them from the cleanest and most wholesome prairie prostitutes ever put on film.

It's great entertainment to watch Will Anderson whip these boys into manhood with all the bravado of a marine sergeant. Their newly discovered manhood is ultimately tested towards the end as they seek justice and a little revenge against the baddies who steal the herd and cold-bloodily kill Will Anderson. Roscoe Lee Browne, Bruce Dern and Colleen Dewhurst lend fine support to a cast that performs well all around. I would like to see an ultimate DVD release with the scenes added back in that were left on the cutting room floor.

Full symphony orchestra and lush strings and punctuated by driving percussion and soaring brass lines. Then we drastically alter the mood with an ""around the campfire"" harmonica echoing some of the same themes. Listen carefully to how Williams accents the feel of each scene whether it is ordinary, comedic, or epic in scope.
