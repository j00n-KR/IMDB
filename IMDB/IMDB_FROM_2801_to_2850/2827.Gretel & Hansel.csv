0,SnoopyStyle,arthouse horror,6,11 December 2020,"As a baby, Gretel was cured by an enchantress who left behind a 'gift'. She has the second sight but when the villagers go to her for predictions, they are angered by the results. Gretel (Sophia Lillis) and her younger brother Hansel are ostracized and forced to live in the forest. They encounter a cottage where Holda (Alice Krige) invites them inside for a tasty meal.This has an interesting bare-bones look and a dark moodiness. The story is a version of Hansel and Gretel and doesn't have much meat to be bone. It's a very strip-down movie. It's an arthouse horror but only delivers horror-like feels for a few scenes. I appreciate that it's trying something but it's not achieving the whole package.",Gretel & Hansel
1,claudio_carvalho,Wonderful Cinematography,5,22 April 2020,"The poor girl Gretel (Sophia Lillis) and his little brother Hansel (Samuel J. Leakey) are left by their mother and they must cross a dark wood seeking out work and food. They stumble upon a house with a feast on the table and Hansel opens the door to get some food. Out of the blue, an old woman (Alice Krige) surprises the little boy and offers a job to the siblings. But soon the smart Gretel feels that something evil lives in the house.""Gretel & Hansel"" is a film slightly based on the Brothers Grimm's fairytale. The wonderful cinematography is impressive, the cast is great, but the pointless screenplay does not help. The pace is also too slow for the genre. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Maria e João: O Conto das Bruxas"" (""Mary and John: The Witch Tale"")",Gretel & Hansel
2,nogodnomasters,It smells of cake,5,11 February 2020,"In this version, we get some background on the witch. Hansel and Gretel are dirt poor and are kicked out by their widow mother. Soon their path cross with the witch as Gretel is taken in as an apprentice in a slightly different take.The story never grabs hold. The direction and script fall short of a decent hook. It had so much potential.",Gretel & Hansel
3,kosmasp,The others,8,24 July 2020,"The only thing (apart from the title), I knew going into this, was that this was supposed to be trash. Now I like me some trash movies from time to time, so I was prepared for that. Turns out that's not the case at all. Actually this is more of an art excercise than anything else. Anything else also including the Hansel & Gretel stories we know - which the title switch of the names might be the first indicator of.That's not all that is different - certain aspects seem to be as you may have seen them in other movies, but the majority of the movie dares to be different. In a lot of ways - character wise, story wise, setting wise, incidents wise ... Now that should answer the question some might have had, about the necessity of the movie: are there not enough of these already? Well apparently you can spin this another way - and it works.Now having said that, it is surely not without flaws, yet the fact it goes places you probably don't expect it to go, handles horror in a way I personally prefer to the in your face jump scares (it is about mood and setting it) and how it is shot (visually) is quite exceptional! You have to be in the mood for this type of film and some may have issues with the pacing - but you can't please everyone anyway!",Gretel & Hansel
4,classicsoncall,"""This is your power, to see what is hidden and take it.""",7,24 December 2020,"An eerily creepy vibe permeates the entire film, and though it's nominally set as a horror film, the terror is more in the eye of the beholder than anything experienced on screen. An opening narrative of a young girl who achieves 'second sight', is expanded in the story to include one of the protagonists. Gretel (Sophia Lillis) becomes an unwitting benefactor of the dark knowledge shared by an old witch (Alice Krige), who's influence over the girl requires separation from her younger brother Hansel (Samuel Leakey). Hallucinogenic mushrooms, mysterious shadowy figures in the forest, and the apparition of a 'pink hat girl' all contribute to Gretel's understanding of where her mission lies after being turned out from her home by a widowed mother who no longer has the room or patience for her children. At times, the viewer is left wondering, like Gretel, whether what's occurring in the picture is reality or a dream, until suddenly being jolted back to Gretel's awareness of her surroundings. Eventually, events in the story conspire to bring Gretel full circle to the realization that she's become a witch in her own right, but instead of using her second sight for a malign purpose, she frees the spirits of the old witch's captive children, and sends her brother on a path to find his own destiny. It's a unique take on the classic fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel, with a creative variation on the twist of pushing a witch into an oven.",Gretel & Hansel
5,paul_haakonsen,"Oh, this was nothing short of abysmal...",2,23 November 2020,"Oh dear God, this movie was so boring that I was ready to claw my own eyes out!Initially when I sat down to watch ""Gretel & Hansel"", I must admit that I was expecting something more in tune with the actual fairytale, but instead I had to sit through what best could be described as a brutal slaughter of the well-known fairytale and a movie that falls pretty far from the core essence of that very fairytale.And with thanks to writer Rob Hayes and director Oz Perkins I just literally wasted 1 hour and 27 minutes of my life on watching this movie which is essentially just a heap of rubbish.""Gretel & Hansel"" is without a doubt one of the movie, if not THE most, boring movies that I had seen that were made in 2020. The fact that I managed to get through this ordeal is astounding.When I sat that Alice Krige was the witch in the movie, I must admit that I genuinely thought that this was actually going to be a good movie. Yeah, except that didn't happen. This movie just is downright boring, and not even Alice Krige could manage to do much for this snoozefest.Visually, then ""Gretel & Hansel"" actually had a nice dark and foreboding atmosphere to it, which definitely counted for something and would have worked well in favor of the movie, had it not been utterly shut down by the atrocity that is the storyline, script and lack of events throughout the course of the movie.This movie came and went without as much the faintest of sounds. I have managed to sit through it, and I can with all honesty say that I will never, ever sit down to watch it again; that would just be too much self-torture.My rating of this 2020 laughable take on the classic fairytale receives a more than generous two out of ten stars, and that is based solely on two things, the atmosphere that permeated the entire movie and the fact that Alice Krige was in the movie.You might want to do yourself a favor and give ""Gretel & Hansel"" a wide berth.",Gretel & Hansel
6,michaelRokeefe,Short of a waste of time,4,27 July 2021,"Plenty of style with too little substance. We really need a version of a fairy tale from the dark side. Most of indoor scenes filmed by candlelight. I watched this for one reason...Sophia Lillis as Gretel. This project is mundane, dull and sleep inducing. Kudos to Alice Krige, who plays one of the finest witches around. Also in the cast: Samuel Leakey, Jessica De Gouw, Charles Babaloia and Melody Carrillo.",Gretel & Hansel
7,zardoz-13,A Good Version of Grimms' Tale,9,26 October 2020,"Halloween and horror movies go together like tricks and treats. Horror movies vary from classic Hollywood monster chilling franchises like ""Dracula,"" ""Frankenstein,"" ""The Wolf Man"" and ""The Mummy"" to depraved slashers and supernatural sagas like ""Friday the 13th,"" ""The Exorcist,"" and ""Alien."" If you're not a gut-munching gorehound, but you want something that will give you shivers without shocks, director Osgood Perkins' ""Gretel & Hansel,"" a revisionist spin on Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm's vintage fairy tale, qualifies as ideal fare. Lenser Galo Olivares's mesmerizing cinematography, Christine McDonagh's surreal art direction, and Jeremy Reed's menacing production designs make this PG-13 creeper worth every moment of its trim 87-minutes. Anybody who saw ""Star Trek: First Contact"" (1996) will recognize Alice Krige as the ghoulish necromancer. Initially, you may not recognize Sophia Lillis as Gretel. She wears her hair cropped short like a teenage prince. Lillis was one of the best things about Andy Muschietti's theatrical, two-chapter remake of Stephen King's novel ""It."" She played Beverly Marsh and hung out with the heroes. Meanwhile, scenarist Rob Hayes and Perkins-son of legendary ""Psycho"" star Anthony Perkins-have re-imagined this Grimm yarn. Happily, ""Gretel & Hansel"" delivers its share of unobtrusive jump scares that may catch you off-guard. The filmmakers rely on fantasy content to appeal to your imagination rather than a cornucopia of appalling gore to repel you. The more impressionable an audience, the greater the impact this atmospheric film will exert. Krige's serenely diabolical performance as the witch is unforgettable. She looks like a female incarnation of Max Schreck's hideous vampire in the black & white, German silent film ""Nosferatu"" (1922), the oldest known surviving Dracula movie on record.""Gretel & Hansel"" opens with an ominous prologue. Doubling as the narrator, Alice Krige relates a story about the Beautiful Child in a pink cap. The parents fear their Beautiful Child will not survive her first winter. The father consults an Enchantress who vanquishes the sickness, but she replaces it with second sight and other evil powers. The village once adored the Beautiful Child. Now, they dread her. Although they want her to read their futures, they deplore the tragic things she predicts about them. Later, the Child prompts her father to commit suicide by wielding a burning iron as a tongue depressor and the village exiles her in the woods. Nevertheless, the Child isn't alone long. The prologue concludes with a moral. ""Nothing is given without something else being taken away."" Presumably, since she narrated the prologue, Krige is the witch that our protagonists encounter.Originally, Hansel was older than Gretel in the legendary German folktale. Perkins and Hayes have re-imagined the basics. Now, Gretel is older of the two. In the Brothers Grimm version, the mother abandoned her children in the woods because their ravenous appetites left only morsels for her husband and herself. For the record, a famine had ravaged the land, and hundreds had starved to death. In Perkins' spin on the yarn, however, an insane mother evicts her daughter Gretel (Sophia Lillis) and her younger brother Hansel (newcomer Samuel Leakey) from her domicile. Earlier, Gretel's father had died; he had toiled as a woodcutter. The mother drives her children out because the house is cluttered with too many ghosts. Few illusions does she cherish about life. ""Dig yourselves some pretty little graves,"" she advises Gretel, ""and dig one for your mother, too."" The forlorn children wander the wilderness in search of food and end up snacking on mushrooms. The 'shrooms scene is the only amusing moment in an otherwise humorless film. Perkins shows Gretel gnawing on a toadstool one minute; the next minute spasms of laughter erupt from her as if she were high on psychedelic drugs.
Eventually, these destitute kids discover an A-frame cottage in the middle of nowhere. The aroma of cake lures Hansel to the gloomy dwelling. The cottage is as dark as obsidian and its windows glow with an eerie red haze. Peering into the house like voyeurs, the children feast their gluttonous eyes on the sight of platters piled high with sweet treats and meats. The witch who occupies the premises, Holda (Alice Krige), is only too happy to feed them. Gratefully, Gretel and Hansel pitch in to help Holda with the daily chores. Earlier, Gretel had turned down a job as a housekeeper because her prospective employer had asked if her virginity were intact. While they lodge with Holda, Gretel has some genuinely spooky dreams. Anybody who sleeps in a haunted house like Holda's is liable to experience some howlers. In one dream, our heroine witnesses a far younger Holda (Jessica De Gouw covered with tattoos) materialize out of an oily puddle. She casts a spell on heaps of slimy, mutilated body parts and transforms them into appetizing food. Later, Gretel acquits herself as a worthwhile adversary and triumphs over the treacherous witch.In an ""Entertainment Weekly"" interview, Perkins justified the protagonists' age change of age. ""It's awfully faithful to the original story. It's got really only three principal characters: Hansel, Gretel, and the Witch. We tried to find a way to make it more of a coming of age story. I wanted Gretel to be somewhat older than Hansel, so it didn't feel like two 12-year-olds - rather a 16-year-old and an 8-year-old. As hypnotic as Sophie Lillis is as the heroine, her character boasts gifts of her own that sets her apart from ordinary individuals and proves more than a match for the wicked Holda. French pop/rock composer Robin Coudert provides an uncanny instrumental soundtrack reminiscent of something that the rock group Goblin composed for a Dario Argento Euro slasher movie. Mild but malicious, this cultured horror thriller boasts some unrivaled phantasmagoric moments that will quicken your pulse. Indeed, Perkins' film is closer to its unexpurgated source material than most mainstream movies. Altogether, competently orchestrated and gorgeously photographed, ""Gretel & Hansel"" shares little in common with either the Mother Goose or the Walt Disney versions.",Gretel & Hansel
8,Calicodreamin,"Typical ""artisanal"" movie",4,1 February 2020,"This movie falls into the niche category of horror movies that throw everything out the window (plot, dialogue, acting...) in an effort to be artistic and cerebral. Undoubtedly the cinematography is beautiful, but that's the only positive. The plot is thin, the acting is okay but theres nothing there, and the overall movie was a bit boring. A definite creep factor, but not scary at all, which was a real let down.",Gretel & Hansel
9,view_and_review,Unbearably Boring,3,2 February 2020,"The struggle was real. It was a constant fight to stay awake. Twice I succumbed to the Sandman only to wake up in the same dream. ""Gretel & Hansel"" tried to put me out again but I was determined to stay awake and torture myself.There's no mystery what the premise of this movie is about. Everyone knows the age old story of ""Hansel & Gretel."" A young brother and sister go into the woods, they find a house made of delicious treats, they eat from the house, get captured by a witch who fattens them up to eat them except they escape and kill her.The story has been retold, remixed, and redone several times both literarily and cinematically. The last cinematic version I saw was with Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton in ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"" (2013). That was more of a Hansel & Gretel the adult years where they hunt other witches to prevent other kids from getting eaten or worse.This version tries to go the scary route. It was dark and ominous the majority of the movie. They also wanted to give it a new age spin by making Gretel the main focus as you can probably gather by the title: ""Gretel & Hansel."" They have followed the Hollywood trend of other movies that have taken known and established stories or franchises and remade them to have a feminine focus. Look no further than ""Star Wars,"" ""Terminator,"" ""Ghostbusters,"" ""Ocean's 11,"" and others. It's lazy and it's a disservice. The movies are trash--not because they are feminine centric, but because writers are just rehashing something that has made goo gobs of money and gave them heroines as though that is somehow fresh, radical, or unique. It's none of those. It's tired, lazy, and lame. Do something new and original and maybe, just maybe, it will be good.In ""Gretel & Hansel"" Gretel was the older sister and, for the most part, caretaker of Hansel. While wandering the woods in a state of near starvation they found the witch's house. The witch was a child eater, but she only wanted to eat Hansel and not Gretel. In Gretel she saw power and wanted to help her cultivate that power. Hansel, as the witch explained, was only weighing Gretel down. If she would only let him go, then she would be free. Read: if women would only discard the shackles known as men then they could realize their true potential. That same message was intimated elsewhere in the movie when Gretel called the witch ""misses"" and the witch said, ""I'm not married. Do you see a ball and chain on me.""If the message wasn't clear enough from the two aforementioned examples, then there were three men in the movie to make the ""male bad, female good"" message stronger. Of the three men, one was morally reprehensible, one was some sort of animal, and one was chivalrous. So, two of the three men were dangerous while one was good. If that was analogous to real life then that's sad. I only hope that I'm of the 1/3rd that are good.Gretel finds the strength to save her brother from being eaten, but she also lets him go. The boy was all of nine years old at the oldest and yet he is a male so she had to cut him loose to be the goddess she was meant to be. It's a pathetic retelling of a classic in which neither Hansel nor Gretel was the dominant character. Maybe one day Hollywood writers will be creative for a change. And maybe pigs will fly.",Gretel & Hansel
10,george.schmidt,Not Your Stepmother's Fairy Tale,9,1 September 2021,"GRETEL & HANSEL (2020) ***1/2 Sophia Lillis, Samuel Leakey, Alice Krige, Jessica De Gouw, Fiona O, Shaughnessy, Doncha Crowely, Charles Babalola. Spookily and atmospheric re-imagining of the Grimm fairy tale (um note the title's billing for one thing) with the titular siblings (a very impressive Lillis and Leakey) who find themselves homeless and being taken in by an old woman (scary as fuck Krige) who is actually a witch agreeing to keep them for more salacious reasons. Filmmaker Osgood Perkins smartly employs a very rich production with gorgeous cinematography by Galo Olivares, eerie production design by Jeremy Reed and Christine McDonagh's impeccably colored art direction gives new meaning to new blood in a re-telling of a children's classic. Kudos also to Robin Coudert (aka Rob)'s musical score that echoes the likes of Goblin (!)",Gretel & Hansel
11,siderite,"A pretty mess, but I expected worse",7,10 March 2021,"Lovely Sophia Lillis of It fame plays Gretel, the older sister of Hansel and the main character of the story. For several reasons they reach the house of the witch, played brilliantly by Alice Krige. Now, since they put the girl first they had to make it a little about feminism, refusing to be used by men, being brave, accepting herself and how men should fear her and so on, but it wasn't heavy handed enough to be annoying. The acting is very good and the visuals very well done. Unfortunately, the story is exactly what that of the very short fairy tale and nothing more.One could say that the film borrows atmospheric elements from The VVitch, but it doesn't work. The witch's house is quite modern, Gretel uses modern words and is very confident, rational and feels educated, even when she claims she is not. The contrast makes the beginning of the movie completely superfluous and breaks the medieval feel that the sound kind of conveys, leaving us with the classic kids outsmarting adult plot.Bottom line: better than most Hansel und Gretel adaptations, but other than the cinematic style, it brings little to the story.",Gretel & Hansel

14,westsideschl,Incomplete,4,6 May 2020,"Felt really incomplete. Lots of holes such as family background of the girl & her brother; the time period (suppose to be long time ago, but the house looked very modern). Most importantly the ending was rushed given we were being fed literally (i.e. seems as if a third of the movie was about eating food) that a confrontation was coming between Gretel & the witch which as it turned out was very anticlimactic. The witch's back story was superficial & incomplete. The telekinesis was dumb as was the black fingers representing supernatural powers. Finally, the children at the end made no sense other than the producers are setting us up for a sequel. Supposedly a positive was the eerie woods, but to me they just were typical trees.",Gretel & Hansel

On their way they find a house and they get in because the were starving but they find much more than food.I liked this movie because it was a good adaptation of the well known fairy tale, the interpretations of the cast were very good and the direction which was made by Oz Perkins was equally good to the interpretations of the cast. He also presented very well the main characters of the movie, their story and also the evolution of them was simply exceptional.

However, i was left very much disappointed and disturbed on how much time was wasted watching this. The movie is horrible and one of the worst horror films. The bland script and tedious direction. The direction made this movie seem like the lowest quality. It feels like a bad very old horror film that fails to capture scares or be worthy of watching. It gets a bit of a grasp of the story. But the direction fails to capture thrills or scares. Almost feels like The Witch film with its boring and slow direction. The cast was horrible and they delivered dull performances. The music feels odd. It is hard to recommend this film for people who know the story or people looking for a horror film. I definitely recommend skipping this movie and save your time.",Gretel & Hansel

The storyline is about two orphaned children in the streets relying only on each other to eat and survive.

This movie is directed by Oz Perkins (The Black Coat's Daughter) and stars Sophia Lillis (IT), Alice Krige (Sleepwalkers), Samuel Leakey (Twist) and Fiona O'Shaughnessy (Alexander). The storyline for this is so well told. I loved how gritty this movie is which sets the tone and feel for this intense film. The landscape, cinematography, sets and costumes were all fantastic. There's a dark cloud over the entire film. I really liked this way more than I should have. This was a great addition to the genre in a Sleep Hollow kind of way that I'd strongly recommend.

20,stevendbeard,Weird Interpretation Of The Fairy Tale,6,2 February 2020,"I saw ""Gretel & Hansel"", starring Sophia Lillis-the new It movies, Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase; Samuel Leakey-this is his first movie but he was in a mini series called MotherFatherSon; Alice Krige-Thor:The Dark World, Star Trek:First Contact and Jessica De Gouw-Arrow_tv, Dracula_tv.
This is a retelling of the fairy tale about the 2 children Hansel & Gretel and it was filmed in Ireland. The order of their names is changed in the title because this movie focuses more on Gretel, who is older than Hansel-she is 16 & he is 12. Sophia plays Gretel and Samuel plays Hansel, the two children forced to fend for themselves in the woods after their mother kicks them out-shortage of food was given as a reason by their mother. Sophia & Samuel are totally exhausted and starving when they come across a house occupied by Alice, an old strange woman living by herself-but she just happens to have a dinner table full of fresh food. From here is where the story strays from the original tale. Alice starts training Sophia in the arts of witchcraft as Samuel spends his time cutting down trees with an ax. Jessica plays the younger version of Alice, and you learn in flashbacks about how her past influenced her and made her the person she became-you know, eating kids and such.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for disturbing images, violence and drug content and has a running time of 1 hour & 27 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-no repeated viewings-but if you like weird interpretations of fairy tales, then it would be a good rental.",Gretel & Hansel

(or its singular pronunciation) in her mouth, but that's exactly what many of the Haters seem to be doing with GRETEL & HANSEL. The only proper way to see this flick is AFTER you've stayed up too late the night before (that is, when you're suffering from not getting enough sleep). That way, as GRETEL & HANSEL unspools and you're fighting to stay awake in one of those new, ultra comfortable plush reclining theater chairs, you'll be able to empathize perfectly with the challenges facing title heroine ""Gretel"" throughout this film. Like her, you'll be constantly wondering, ""Did I just see THAT, or was it only a dream?"" Just as a certain type of person used to enjoy those ""John Wayne"" Westerns with ALL punches pulled, what's there NOT to appreciate about a ""horror"" movie in which EVERY bit of foreshadowing and gore might turn out to be figments of someone's dream (either yours, or the film crew's)?

22,robfollower,'Gretel & Hansel' is worth a watch for arthouse sensibilities & Gothic fiction.,7,31 January 2020,"I enjoy atmospheric, visual-driven horror films. Gretel & Hansel delivers both aspects in spades.After the death of their father and the mental break-down of their mother, Gretel (Sophia Lillis) and her younger brother Hansel find themselves lost and alone. As they wander, a virtuous huntsman directs them to a woodsman's family that will care for them, if they can safely traverse the foreboding forest - which is the abode of a mysterious witch (Alice Krige).The director of ""The Blackcoat's Daughter"" and ""I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House,"" Oz Perkins is certainly a fan of scary movies. He's not one to embrace shock value by using cheap jolts, I applaud him for that. Wisely embracing a sinister creep of malevolent forces as they attempt to corrupt the seemingly pure. ""Gretel & Hansel is a proper fit for Osgood Perkins, presenting us with a disturbing tale of caution. I very much enjoyed the art-house sensibilities . The visuals are suitably baroque and sinister. Very clever cinematography Oz Perkins adds to his horror films. 'Gretel & Hansel' has Perkins stamp throughout the film. Sophia Lillis made a phenomenal impact with her work in this film she is so talented . Albeit I love a costume period piece , Sophia Lillis missteps not speaking with a foreign accent to match the other lead characters ; the lack of one took me out of the intended period setting. I do not think this would be a huge deal for most it is my pet peeve watching a Period horror flick set in the 1300 century in the Baltic states. The thematically stylistic sense of dread outweighed my slight quibble. Gretel & Hansel is a very stunning film with plenty of visual flourishes and memorable imagery.The film was very served by South African actress Alice Krige, she was excellent. Perkins bathing in his mood of tight aspect ratio, and his love of Alice Krige, who's handed every opportunity to act her heart out as the wrinkled, black-fingered antagonist witch. ""Gretel & Hansel"" has its gruesome moments and is worth a watch for the arthouse sensibilities & classic Gothic fiction. I think most fans of the genre will, at the very least, appreciate this film for what it is. 7/10",Gretel & Hansel

25,kluseba,Creative adaptation of a gothic fairy tale,8,12 March 2021,"Gretel & Hansel is loosely based upon the German folk tale Hänsel & Grethel by the Brothers Grimm. It tells the story of an independent sister and her childish brother who leave their hometown behind to join a group of woodcutters to get some work and earn some money in order to get some food and find a place to live. They are wandering through a forest and almost starving to death when they smell food coming from an isolated house. They are invited by the mysterious owner to share a meal with her and spend the night. The two siblings soon start to suspect that strange things are going on in that house and that the strange lady might not be as friendly as it had initially seemed.Despite surprisingly harsh critics, this reinvention of this German fairy tale is actually one of the best of its numerous adaptations. This movie convinces with excellent visual effects that contrast gloomy and monotonous surroundings with bright and surreal colours. The calm and slow camera work blends in perfectly and adds to the movie's creepy atmosphere. The characters are quite intriguing from the mentally unstable mother over the helpful hunter to the creepy lady. The acting performances are excellent. Sophia Lillis convinces as boyish teenage girl who needs to take care of her younger brother and discover her hidden magical talents. Sam Leakey incarnates the quirky, naive and annoying little brother very well. Alice Krige shines as mysterious old woman with much knowledge and numerous skeletons in her closet. The film convinces with fluid pace and perfect length as it entertains through eighty-seven gripping minutes.There are few things to complain about. Some of the dialogues between Gretel and the mysterious woman could have been cut short. The ending could have been a little bit more detailed to tell us about the fates of the two siblings.In the end, Gretel & Hansel offers a gloomy mixture of fantasy, horror and mystery elements. The visual effects are as stunning as the acting performances. The story isn't particularly surprising but well-executed. If you like ancient tales with sinister vibes, then you should enjoy watching this movie on a cold dark night.",Gretel & Hansel
26,aidanratesmovies,"Beautiful, but mostly a missed opportunity",5,23 August 2020,"Although I will give the film props for its interesting reinvention and gothic take on such a classic tale, Gretel and Hansel seems to fall short of anything truly significant, and for the most part, is unfortunately, a bit of a bore. There isn't many actors in the film, but I did enjoy Sophia Lillis as always as the titular character, as well as the casting of Alice Krige as the witch, who portrays the character very well. The film is shot beautifully, and has a very well orchestrated look, tone, and atmosphere. It's visually impressive, no doubt, with its cinematography being incredibly admirable all the way up to the films credits, but unfortunately, the film lacks something a bit more. To sum it up, the result that lies by the end of this film, feels incredibly mottled. It starts out strong, with some great writing and an intriguing setting and story, but it can't seem to decide how to tell its own tale, and very well be confused on what tale it wants to tell precisely. It can be rather slow, with its pace slowing to a crawl at times, and I found myself by the end, wondering when the film would be over. In the end, Gretel and Hansel is sadly another missed opportunity for the classic duo (at least in film form). It's impressively shot, but lacking anything that truly sticks, it is mostly a beautiful, but odd and forgettable work that may not be worth the hour and a half to spend watching it.

27,peterp-450-298716,An aesthetically beautiful film.,7,7 June 2020,"Tell me the fairy tale again.
It's too scary, you'll start seeing things that aren't there.In recent years we have been flooded with live-action versions of well-known Disney fairy tales. These usually follow the fairytale story without deviation. Even the appearance and atmosphere are mostly identical to the original. However, this isn't the case with ""Gretel & Hansel"". Director Osgood Perkins has gone to great lengths to make it an idiosyncratic creation. It largely corresponds to the original story of the Brothers Grimm. But the moral of the story is very different from the original fairy tale. So, no nasty stepmother. No pebbles or bread crumbs. In the original fairy tale, Hans was more inventive. Here he's a helpless little fellow dependent on his bigger sister. But it's mainly the role Gretel plays in this story and how this character evolves. Hence probably also the switching of the names in the film title, which indicates Gretel's part is more important.The period in which it takes place is comparable to that in ""The VVitch"" or ""Apostle"". Most likely at the time of the great famine in the 14th century, when it was difficult for many to survive. Most lived in shabby houses and had no means to meet their daily needs. Similarly, the mother of Gretel and Hans, who chases the children out of the house with unmistakable words (and a dangerous-looking lumberjack ax). First, they are advised by a friendly man to look for work and join a group of lumberjacks and especially not to deviate from the path. Hunger and the discovery of delicious looking mushroom causes the two children to leave the path and discover a black house in the forest.The mushroom scene can be called amusing and already suggests that this film is certainly not an accessible version of the known fairy tale. It's also not recommended to watch this with your kids as you did with ""The Lion King"". This film is too dark, gloomy, and perhaps too terrifying for small children. Even though I found the label ""horror"" a bit exaggerated. ""Gretel & Hansel"" isn't really creepy. Don't expect the typical elements of a horror. No jump scares. No gory scenes or possessed creepy persons. But certainly, you'll experience an unpleasant and disturbing feeling throughout the whole movie. An intense, eery atmosphere in which you are immersed.I also fear that due to its artistic character and experimental production, this morbid fairy tale isn't for everyone. Many horror fans will be terribly disappointed and rather portray it as a pretentious movie. Evildoers are of course the lack of tension and the slow pace. But for me, it was the unique atmosphere and the imaginative story that made it an exciting experience. The design of the witch house (without gingerbread walls decorated with all kinds of sweetness) will confuse you. A pitch-black, modernist house built with contemporary materials and styles. Not exactly something you will start nibbling on. On the one hand, the interior is characteristic of that specific time. But on the other hand, there are also style features that belong to the present era. And the richly filled table full of delicious stews and pastries is a feast for the eyes.What appealed to me the most was the excellent cast. Alice Krige as the terrifying and devilish witch in particular was simply fabulous. And Sophia Lillis also plays the role of Gretel convincingly. A young girl with unexpected future prospects. The beautiful music and sound effects together with the used color palette, provided a special atmosphere. Only the denouement I found a bit unfortunate and not appropriate for the slow tempo of the film. I can certainly enjoy a straightforward version of a fairy tale. But this contrary version managed to surprise me. Definitely a film for those who love aesthetically beautiful films.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",Gretel & Hansel
28,questl-18592,G&H,2,9 February 2020,"This might be one the clumsiest films I've seen in ages. There's so much that it sets up and never does anything with. Characters introduced with seeming significance who are then completely gone from the rest of the movie. Moments that seem to hint at the importance of color, which is never made relevant. Character movements that are so sudden and inexplicable to the point of being jarring.For a moment I thought maybe the film was doing this intentionally, keeping the viewer of balanced and guessing to prevent any predictability in the narrative, but I feel as though such thoughts give the movie far too much credit.The acting is bad. Characters feel so wooden and forced. Some of that is child acting but given some of the high quality child acting we've seen recently I'm less inclined to excuse that. One of the children was in the IT films and seemed quite good in that too, so maybe it's directing that's bad.Then the film moved into the realm of just stupidly ignoring it's own lore. Gretel and Hansel regularly repeat a folktale about a young girl and dark powers and the horrible, unholy danger of such things. Yet, when confronted by the very obvious witch they don't even balk at it, they just go along and accept the 'help' despite the very, very obvious signs that something is wrong. Again, the movie is clunky and lacks any finesse.The only real positive is the set designs. It looks very olde world grimey and authentic even. But that's it for the good stuff.This was just bad. I could never dive in or enjoy the world because there were a constant stream of immersion breaking moments and just utterly wretched dialogue.Avoid at all costs.",Gretel & Hansel
29,truemythmedia,Very Watchable,6,3 February 2020,"There are many scenes in this movie that are very good, there are many images that are very creepy, and the overall story is one that feels somewhat unique even though it's based on a story that could date back to the 1300s, during the time of the Great Famine in Germany, and has been retold thousands of times, and recently too (remember ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters""?).
This movie looks gorgeous- from production design to cinematography, everything is beautiful. It's shot in a smaller aspect ratio than normal (1.55:1), giving the film a squarer look. The way that Holda's home is designed, to look incredibly triangular, works amazing when shot in this aspect ratio, because it gives everything a more perfectly aligned look. There are honestly very few shots in this whole film that don't look gorgeously grim. The way that some of the dream sequences are shot are awesome too, and the hidden chamber behind the wall, where most of those dream sequences take place, is probably the most chilling use of minimalism I've seen in a PG-13 mainstream horror flick. It's there in that room that some of the gorier images arise, and also where a fair amount of the chilling sequences come from.
If you like slower, more atmospheric horror films then this movie is a good way to kill an hour-and-twenty-five minutes, but if you're looking for a fast-paced, jump-scare-filled PG-13 horror flick aimed at teenage couples who want to squeal with delighted terror every time a loud bang is made, then look somewhere else; this movie isn't that at all. As a whole, I thought this movie was incredibly watchable, but it also had plenty of small flaws throughout.",Gretel & Hansel

The VERDICT:Gretel and Hansel is a great example of visionary creativity to make an old tale feel new. With haunting atmosphere and a cast to play in it, these are the main strengths for the film and the component artistic loving movie goers are going to love. Yet, this artistic nature really took away from the story for me and left me with a boring, bloated film that missed the potential the trailers painted. Story wise the characters are rather flat, the extra story characters and background information so streamlined it is almost a waste of film for this reviewer. Throw in too much focus on the political message hogging most of the attention and you get this film that seems to be two sharks circling, but never attacking. I give props for a psychological dive and realistic portrayal in the film, but this Grimm's Fairy Tale is a little too sleep inducing and bloated for my tastes. Thus, I believe this film was dumped into theaters, when it really should have premiered on a streaming network instead best left for watching at home. Thus, my scores are:Fantasy/Horror/Thriller: 5.5

31,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"A unique take on the classic story, with some confusing plot elements",6,9 February 2020,"Re-imaging of classic tales are not uncommon practices, especially in the film making industry. Whether it be based on a pre-existing literary work or if it was completely original, Hollywood is bound to have someone remake or reboot a film that resonated with viewers. The story of Hansel and Gretel are very much a well-known story from the brothers Grim. Having all kinds of their stories adapted to different movies like Cinderella, Rapunzel or Little Red Riding Hood, the brothers Grim were able to make a number of their fairy tales stick with their readers. Up until this point though, much of the movies that depicted Hansel & Gretel were not as true to the written work. Here though, this feature seems to make it it's mission. It probably could have used a tad more tweaking.The story follows the basic backbone of the classic tale. In order to survive what seems to be a famine, two siblings by the name of Gretel (Sophia Lillis) and Hansel (Samuel Leakey) head out into the dark forest where they encounter a suspicious kind lady (Alice Krige) who takes them in. Written by Rob Hayes (East Meets Barry West (2009)) and directed by Anthony Perkins' son Osgood (Oz) Perkins, the executions to this adaptation has a number effective things, but still has some hurdles to overcome. The struggle that viewers might have with this film is trying to understanding the time setting. While it looks very much like viewers are being transported to the olden days, there are things that make it feel out of place. Such as Hansel's hat; it's a baseball cap. Not sure that sport was around for people to know.There's also an aspect to the story that involves supernatural elements for certain characters. However, this isn't fully rounded out as the screenplay does not give context to its viewers. And overall, the film just isn't scary. While having a PG-13 rating usually is a bad sign, that's not even it. It's just won't make its audience scared, as the story itself is not enough to win desensitized horror fanatics. However, this does not mean the film doesn't have merit. While the film isn't scary, it definitely is creepy. Assuming Osgood Perkins inherited some of his father's horror genes, it seems the direction had the right intentions behind it. There really aren't any lively colors, which help further drive home just how bleak the setting is for the protagonists. While Osgood Perkins hasn't direct many films so far, he has had his fair share of work in other places.The actors cast for this film also do a great job. Both Sophia Lillis & Samuel Leakey are believable as siblings and viewers should be able to care for them. Lillis was also a part of It (2017) and It: Chapter 2 (2019). However, the actress who has a more interesting presence goes to Alice Krige as the suspicious old lady the siblings happen to stumble upon. Sporting a full black cloak and speaking in a very soft tone. Krige makes sure people pay attention and it should definitely give people goosebumps. Not to mention the fact that Krige has participated in other films involving unsettling situations like Ghost Story (1981), Sleepwalkers (1992) and most notably as the borg queen from Star Trek: First Contact (1996). There's also brief appearances from some younger actors like Charles Babalola and Jessica De Gouw.The visuals, as stated before do favor the experience when watching this film. For newcomer Galo Olivares, working the camera for his first feature film seemed to come only naturally. Majority of the time, the camera is steady and is able to capture exactly what the story needs to tell the right way. Nothing is overly used nor poorly setup like other amateur horror films. Practically no horror stings. As for music, the score was composed by Robin Coudert also known as ROB. Having worked on other horror films like Horns (2013) and Maniac (2012), the sound is a surprising listening experience. Not only does Coudert include a main theme, but also mixes organic orchestra with more contemporary sounding synthesizers. Yet, it fits the film well as much as the setting takes place in what seems a different era completely.From a narrative perspective, the script covers almost everything except for some key components that lead to the end. It's also not scary, just creepy. Which means the film still deserves a watch because the actors do their part, the camerawork is handled competently and the music is a nice listen.",Gretel & Hansel

The score is subtle but engaging. All of these things were pretty satisfying which has made it all the more disappointing that the story was not better.I may end up watching it again or suggesting it because of the creep factor but, yeah, it's disappointing to not have the story to complete all the great directions it could have gone due to how well everything had been setup.",Gretel & Hansel

But I should have known considering the director is Oz Perkins whose responsible for the criminally underseen and underrated Blackcoats Daughter. Like that film this one has a slow burn style and handles the supernatural aspects subtly until the films climax. Although it's not completely successful at nailing it all down. There is much to be appreciated from the films oddly entrancing visuals to the strong performances from Alice Krige (Sleepwalkers) and Sophie Lillis (It) and the complex but intriguing subtext about a young girl coming of age especially in today's society, harnessing her power and deciding what to do with it.

The Black Forest in the fall looked very impressive and eerie. Their mother wanted them to leave the house so the siblings head into the forest. Gretel was seeing silhouettes of witches in the distance. They encountered a man whose house was by the river. Gretel took a bath outside by the river and the house. Everything looked so magical and right out of a fairy tale. He wanted them to go thru a certain path and meet the foresters. But they ended up at the witch's house. It was designed in a very eerily beautiful way. Gretel peeked in thru a hole in the window and saw a table full of delicious food. They were invited in. The plant book of the witch looked really intriguing. She said Gretel was the same as her. She was seeing things, too. She found a doorknob behind the wall of the cabinet. She dreamed of what's behind that door. Gretel wanted Hansel to leave because he was a burden for her. He witch ate all her kids because they were her burden, too. That was vital for her transformation. And she made herself look like an old lady to give a less intimidating impression. They were behind that door in a room with a very high ceiling and a table. She was pinned to the table and the witch was leading Hansel. He was climbing the ladder leading to a iron cage over the furnace. She pinned the witch over the furnace by moving the broom with her eyes. She saved her brother and she wanted them to take forking paths so Hansel left on a horse and Gretel's fingers turned black just like the witch's and she was free. It was an eerie fairytale with a good-for-her finale. Also, Alice Krige as the old witch was amazing.",Gretel & Hansel

40,rockman182,Gretel and Hansel (2020),5,2 February 2020,"I read a book of the Grimm Brothers fairy tales a few years back. A lot of them are excellent and a bit dark. Hansel and Gretel is a very popular Grimm tale and its even been adapted (sort of) with the film with Jeremy Renner a few years back. There hasn't really been a stand out American adaptation that is linear to the timeline of the Grimm story, so Oz Perkins decided to adapt one. I wanted to like this film because of the story and dark atmosphere but the film felt so padded and was dull for most of the time.
The film is about a brother and sister who are from a poor family. They are looking for work when the stumble upon a house in the woods. In that house lives an old lady who feeds the two children an abundance of food. The two offer their services to help the lady out and spend a good deal of their time at her house. However, things are not what they seem and Gretel soon becomes plagued with the reality that the woman is a child eating witch with evil powers.
The film changed up the classic name as the film focuses more on Gretel as a central character and often her internal struggles are brought to light. The film stars Sophia Lillis who first made waves in Sharp Objects and then the It film series. It was the perfect time to cast her in a new horror film as she seems like a star. I think the film is well acted but the real strength comes from the set design, lighting, and the overall dark and grim atmosphere. There are some images in the film which look excellent. However, this isn't en ugh to save us from the dull and bumbling nature of the film.
The film is under 90 minutes long but feels like an eternity at times. It definitely feels drawn out and short on plot as it just kind of sets itself up towards the predictable revelation. There are times throughout where I lost interest and was disappointed that the film didn't do more with what it had. What we got was a forgettable horror film that was boring.

41,RforFilm,"It's a shame that Gretel & Hansel couldn't have more natural characters, because the look and music almost makes up for it",4,1 February 2020,"Once upon a time, in the kingdom of storytelling, lie the original auteurs of fairy tales, the Brothers Grimm. Their known for their classical tales such as ""The Golden Goose"", ""The Elves and the Shoemaker"", ""Snow White"", and of course, the subject of today's movie, ""Hansel and Gretel"". All of these stories have been retold as family friendly and cute several times, which is probably why they stick with us. What also stick with them is how dark a lot of them are. It's obvious that their all meant to be cautionary stories to teach us about the harsh realities of the world.Looking at ""Hansel and Gretel"", we have the classic story of two children that come across a house of sweets, get lured in by a witch that lives there, and defeat her using their cleaver wit. This is a famous analogy on trusting random strangers, especially the ones that offer candy to go to them. It's also a great lesson in how images can be deceiving. But unlike ""Snow White"" or ""Sleeping Beauty"", this story has not had a lot of adaptations, not even an animated movie from Disney. Now we have a gothic retelling with Gretel & Hansel.Teenager Gretel (played by Sophia Lillis) is struggling with her position in the old world as a person whose only told she's good for subservient work. After she fails at acquiring a job, her stepmother accuses her of not paying her fair share and forces her and her brother Hansel (played by Sam Leakey) out. Gretel remains optimistic that she and her brother will find something and even manage to spend a night at a kind hunter's home. They wonder around the woods, becoming more hungry as time goes by.They eventually come across a home in the woods, that also has a lot of food on the table. They find an old woman who lives there, Holda (played by Alice Kringe) who offers food and shelter. They eat and gorge as Hansel is swayed by the promise that he'll be trained as a woodsmen. Gretel knows something is off with the place, but Holda also promises her to teach her ways of magic. Gretel also remembers about an old story her father told her about a young girl whose psychic abilities pushed her into the same woods. Could this old woman have a connection with it?Like a lot of January releases, Gretel & Hansel has a lot of problems that prevent it from being effective. A lot of it is on Gretel. I know the actress Sophia Lillis can give a good performance (as she did in the It movies), but along with keeping her American accent (which is awkward as everyone else has an English accent), she seems to be directed in a way that comes off more wooden then it should be. I appreciate the movie trying to give her more character, but it's going to fail if the acting doesn't come off that natural.Plus when it comes to the retelling of the story, it's trying to do a lot. When it's telling the fairy tale, it is effective. When it's trying to be a female empowerment story, it feels really forced. I don't have anything against that, but it needs to be done in a story that portrays that positively. Gretel & Hansel sends a mixed message where the witch and her powers are bad, yet Gretel (along with the movie) wants to take part in it...to be her own woman? I don't get what message it's trying to send, but it's clear the movie isn't smart enough to find that balance.It's a shame because the movie does have a lot of good things. The movie's production and cinematography is really good. It's fog filled forests and candlelit caves and homes give you a good sense of gothic and creep. Its something I myself would be terrified to enter on my own and would make a good maze for those Halloween haunts. The music, which has a synth sound, does add on to Gretel & Hansel's tone. I thought it would be out of place, but something about it does make it even scarier then it really is. Perhaps this movie is the equivalent of ""looks can be deceiving"".I'll give this four candy houses out of ten. Is this worth a watch? I don't know if I can say so in theaters. But I can see people enjoying this around the Halloween timeframe. I don't think this was for me as I still see it as too boring to care about. I may pick up the soundtrack. That'll be one thing I pick up from this candy house.",Gretel & Hansel

The movie loses itself too often in a dreamscape horror without rectifying or clarifying, which leaves the metaphor foggy and the horror muted.

44,kuarinofu,Not quite as it seems at first sight (but very forgettable),7,8 April 2020,"I was hyped to see this after February (The Blackcoat's Daughter), but after seeing this I can say I'm slightly disappointed.At first glance, Gretel & Hansel looks like style over substance film. It is heavily stylized and borrows some interesting looks from classic films like Tarkovsky's ""Mirror"" and more. I'm not exactly sure though why the prologue is in 2.35 to 1 and then it switches to 1.55 to 1, but ok.At some point, you get used to beautifully color corrected shots of the woods and unrealistic stylized imagery and you start to question if the story is going to kick in.The story in this sort of does a drive-by, it never really arrives but more like passes the characters. Lots of story elements are established and then abandoned, some of the scenes are in the film only to pad the runtime. It lacks emotional substance I thought I would get, the acting is also very cold and blank.By the end of the film, it becomes clear that the script just doesn't hold. It's empty, it's a very basic story with added modern elements that are underutilized. So, if you drop the style, the looks, and the soundtrack - there is nothing more in this.It's not even that good as a horror film, it is a creepy and dark fairy tale, but the horror is exchanged for weirdness just for the sake of it.Overall, not a horrible film, it was pleasant to the eye, the music was good, both Alice Krige and Jessica De Gouw were great (with Jessica De Gouw being stunning as the young witch, which just makes me sadder just because she didn't get nearly enough screen time).I can't recommend this to anyone though, average moviegoers would not enjoy or understand this for sure, horror fans will get disappointed.",Gretel & Hansel

47,msbreviews,"Technically very captivating, but lacking compelling storytelling.",5,21 February 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)As surprising (and shameful) as it might be, I didn't know the original tale of which the film is based on. Maybe I just couldn't remember because once I learned the story, it did seem familiar. Either way, not knowing anything before-hand is my favorite way of ""preparing"" myself to watch a movie. I was moderately interested in this horror take of Gretel & Hansel, and I was genuinely excited to see Sophia Lillis as the lead actress. I feel very divided about it. It's a super captivating film production-wise, but it lacks some emotionally compelling storytelling, especially in the last third of the narrative.First of all, Sophia Lillis is excellent as Gretel. I really enjoyed her performances in It and It: Chapter Two, and I knew she had something special. It was a matter of time until she got the right role at the right movie, and Oz Perkins can thank her for carrying most of the story on her shoulders. With a well-balanced display, Lillis beautifully incorporates Gretel's persona, offering a good range of emotions, and proving that she has a future under horror projects.Gretel's love for her brother is demonstrated both through affection and cold interactions, making their relationship feel less fairytale and more realistic. Sam Leakey is a pleasant surprise as Hansel, considering this is his acting debut. While it's noticeable that he's still green, he didn't annoy me at all, and he actually delivered a couple of great lines. Alice Krige offers a cliche yet weirdly captivating performance as the evil witch.Nevertheless, it's through its beautiful visuals and addictive original score (very 80s-like) that Gretel & Hansel got me invested until the end. Its production and set design create such an immersive environment, and its score (Robin Coudert) elevates basically every single scene. Galo Olivares' cinematography features an unusual style, but one that easily generates tension and suspense. Technically, it's honestly a fantastic surprise, I was not expecting such a high-level film in these regards.However, it all comes down to the two main components of every movie: screenplay and characters. Even if Gretel is well-developed, the other characters could have received a bit of more care. The screenplay is the main issue, though. It starts with narration and heavy exposition. Something that takes too much out of the runtime, and it seems partially unnecessary since some of the information is somewhat repeated later on. It also spoils (well, it heavily hints) the connecting dots to the second half's mystery, turning that half too predictable and, to be completely honest, a tad boring.The ending is also underwhelming. By not being able to properly close the narrative, the feeling of disappointment is tricky to avoid. It's one of those films that will definitely divide critics and audiences all around the world. The first group still has the technical aspects that can captivate anyone until the very end. However, audiences simply want to be entertained, and the purposefully slow pacing won't help, so I do understand if this group has an adverse reaction to this adaptation.All in all, Gretel & Hansel is a pretty uncommon horror flick. It possesses technical features worthy of the very best movies of the same genre, but its screenplay lacks creativity and overall quality. A predictable narrative with slow pacing is (almost?) never a good attribute. Nevertheless, Sophia Lillis is an outstanding lead, giving a great performance. Galo Olivares' cinematography is pretty unique, the production and set design make the whole environment very immersive, but it's the addictive score from Robin Coudert that steals the spotlight. Oz Perkins shows excellent directing skills, but a less appealing second half with a disappointing third act doesn't let this film reach its true potential.Rating: C+",Gretel & Hansel
48,jp_91,A modern classic.,10,1 February 2020,"Gretel & Hansel is an awesome horror adaptation of the German fairy tale of the same name. The cinematography is perfect, an art horror film. The script is creepy and the acting wonderful, Sophia Lillis is a terrific young actress with a great future and Alice Krige is creepy playing her role. Oz Perkins is a cool director, he deserves more attention. Gretel & Hansel is full of feminism, a story about a young girl ready for living in this dangerous world. The film is a mix between The VVitch and Hereditary, with a special fantasy touch. Obviously Gretel & Hansel is a modern classic, the first good horror film of this year 2020 and the first good horror film of this new decade. Maybe could be listed in a future as one of the best horror films of the 2020s.",Gretel & Hansel
49,0w0,"So many interesting things, but too little time spent on each",5,9 April 2020,"What's the huntsman's story?
What's the little girl with the pink hat's story?
Where is the little girl now?
What about Sophia Lillis' character? Does she turn out being good or evil?I would have loved to see the movie spend more time on these character, yet the movie just flies past them and leaves you questioning who they actually are...The movie's plot is dark... VERY dark... from the very start all the way to the end, it's all just dealing with very dark subjects and dark situations... it's not really a scary movie at all either, so the dark subject matter isn't even there to scare you, it's just there to depress you and make you feel sad...Sophia Lillis delivered a good performance and Sam Leakey did well too, though Sam had very little screen time overall... The witch (Alice Krige) was a very imposing figure throughout the movie and was acted well.I just honestly feel that if the movie was paced differently and if they spent more time at the huntsman's place and explored what transpired at the end of the movie much more, than this would have easily been a 7/10 movie. For one, the movie is way too short... this movie should have been at least 2hours long, since that would have given much more time to explore the unknown characters in the movie and explored what happened at the end too.Overall it's just a mish-mash of darkness and brooding, with some toil and trouble mixed in... not a good movie, and I certainly wouldn't recommend that you watch it.",Gretel & Hansel

I know the story as a kid, and I went in expecting this to be scary and totally different from the story as a kid, the same as they have turned other childhood stories into horror films. This film missed a lot of opportunities to develop the story to make it a great horror film. It was very boring, confusing and not scary at all. It seem like it was a prequel to a much bigger story.

While this film did have a handful of woke tropes (such as at the hunter is black in a white Euro landscape and Gretel seems to be gender neutral) none of that takes away from the story and in fact in this film it works quite well.

Gretel's parents had purchased the large purple pillow (she wanted to used as a bed for her pet horse). of course her mother got mad and entered the room wearing pointy high heels on her hands and proceeded to break the windows. But mainly, my arm rests (in the theater) were gritty so i was spending a significant amount of time hugging my body, to avoid touching the arm rests. The guy sitting next to me was wearing sports padding (including elbow covers) and he remained UN-aware of the issue.",Gretel & Hansel
55,apryla-58795,I don't mind a slow burn but it better have a decent payoff,5,31 July 2021,"So this flips the tale on its ear a bit. This focuses on Gretal. The boy who played Hansel might as well not been in the movie at all. They could've put clothes on a broom and it would've had the same effect except the broom might've given a better performance.I like Sophia Lillis but she wasn't given very much to work with. I feel that this was Alice Krige's film and she portrayed ""creepy"" very well. They made her very disturbing looking so that helped. Jessica de Gouw is stunningly beautiful and she really made the most of her short screen time.The ending was confusing a bit. It ended surprisingly upbeat. Nothing bad happened. What I don't understand is how did Gretal overpower the witch? She was under the witch's tutelage but her skills were rudimentary at best. If the witch knew that Gretal spiked her tea how could she not figure out Gretal was gonna kill her with that branch? And if the witch was so powerful how could she not free herself in order to prevent being burned alive? Also if the witch was dispatched with why couldn't Hansel and Gretal remain together? Why did she send him off at such a young age? Did she fear that her newly acquired skills would affect him somehow?This had potential to be terrifying but after you wait patiently for some kind of pay off you're rewarded by a long pointless speech from Gretal that screams ""I am woman hear me roar!"" And you're left going ""okaaaay...""I wouldn't recommend this. It was like the director was thinking he was gonna come at us with a whole new take on the fairy tale and then had the realization that ""Oh yeah the idea I had sounded good in my head but now that we are actually filming this I've lost the plot and I don't know what to do."" So he patched some stuff together with a voiceover and crossed his fingers and hoped somehow it would magically be a good film after all. No dice. It did not do well.I love horror films but something about his one put me off and I just felt like it wasn't gonna be great...but when you're bored and desperate to find a horror film you settle and so I got what I expected. Meh.",Gretel & Hansel

It proves that making a Midsommar or an Hereditary is not that easy.It tries really hard to be one of those movies (or something in line with The Witch), but it fails in big style. It's difficult to connect and difficult to not think about any other thing while you are watching it. It's just not interesting, even if it looks great and Sophia does a good job.PS: someone needs to tell Oz that beautiful shots don't matter if in a dialogue you are doing 2/3 seconds shots several times.

61,TwistedContent,Make the Best Out of an Empty Script,6,8 April 2020,"Oz Perkins, director of the overlooked spookfest called ""The Blackcoat's Daughter"" (and ""I Am the Pretty Thing that Lives in the House"" which I regretfully haven't seen yet), serves up a new rendition of Grimm Brothers' fairy tale ""Hansel and Gretel"" with a twist - it's now called ""Gretel and Hansel"". Suppose they wanted the female character to be named first. Jokes aside, ""Gretel & Hansel"" is a visually arresting and atmospherically (really trying to be) rich horror tale with a script so lacking it hurts.
I wonder what did Osgood think when he read the script by Rob Hayes, for whom this was the debut in writing a full feature. It seems to me that the director has truly tried to fill a rather eventless script with his by-now-trademark-style (admittedly, the assumption comes from comparing only two movies) atmospheric shock devices. I cannot think of a better word than ""spooky"" - Perkins definitely has find his own interesting and effective filmmaking approach to horror. The story - which we all more or less know - has been spiced up a little, but the problem is that it halts to a long and nearly tedious stop already after the first act. The first half an hour is arguably the most entertaining one & the ever-awaited witch only appears at the end of it. Gretel and Hansel even trip balls on some fly agaric. After the repetitive and streteched-out second act, the third delivers a little more of the goodies and an perhaps unexpected ending, that's not to say it's very satisfying. ""Gretel & Hansel"" possesses two great cards, one of which are the performances by a decent ensemble of actors, from which the highlight belongs to Alice Krige in the skin of the witchy witch. The other card is by far the strongest and that is the all-around amazing visual design of the movie, from extraordinary-feeling cinematography to perfect coloring, good editing & subtly odd but interesting original score. Also, as far as pg13 horror movies usually go, this one's one of the most serious and limit-reaching I've seen.
It's the screenplay that punches itself in the nose with its uneven nature, lack of any real substance and a few silly dialogue lines as a bonus. I suppose the apparent and consistent female perspective does wonders for some viewers, but those changes did not save the movie. Other than that, a great art-house fairy tale if You just give it a chance. My rating: 6/10.",Gretel & Hansel
62,twelve-house-books,Finally Horror for Women,10,10 January 2021,"The director is a man, but this gem is for women (and men who love them). Watch it carefully. The entire thing is a parable for any young woman whether she is coming of age or just reaching her prime. So that's about the storyline, but the cinematography is visually arresting and in many cases utterly terrifying or horrifying (depending on your perspective, and you can find the difference between the two in The Idea of the Holy by Rudolf Otto).

This was also one of the first movies I've seen where I could EASILY tell that so much of it was a set. Sophia carries the movie the best she can, the actor for Hansel, however, isn't all that great. He's a kid though, so it's not like I can really rat on him too hard. The cinematography and sound design in the film is enough so that you think it looks super cool ... for the first 30 minutes. Then you realize what you're watching really isn't all that great. The movie seems to like to shove ""shocking"" imagery into your brain but doesn't goo anywhere with it. The movies would have been better in my opinion if they didn't follow the Hansel and Gretel storyline. It ties them down and you feel kind of like they are just trying to wrap everything up.

That would of added some oomph to this. There just wasn't enough spooky parts. There wasn't any exciting scenes that made me hold my breath in anticipation of what's to come. Nothing made me look away or hide my eyes behind my hands. It needed some horror, some monsters, some pagan rituals or some witch spells. Something horrible needed to happen. It's supposed to be a horror movie but instead it's just the nursery rhyme with all the spooky parts taken out. The children aren't locked up. The children aren't thrown in the fire.

If you liked arthouse horror films like The Witch, Hereditary, & The Cell, everything about this movie just works. The cinematography is excellent, the acting is effective, the director did an absolutely amazing job, and everyone from the costume designer to the special effects team knocked it out of the park with how well everything just came together.This is one of those films where ""every frame is a painting"", and it is so incredibly shot that you could pause the movie at any spot and it would yield an image worthy of a canvas. That how absolutely gorgeous this film is. I was really blown away with how beautiful every visual element of this movie was, and as a student of art, I was immediately drawn into the story based solely on the graphic design of the film.You know, I can see why so many reviewers disliked this movie; it is slow and meticulous, it isn't loud or obnoxious, and it isn't in your face and annoying like Marvel superhero movies or other grade school nonsense. This is a movie made for adults, by adults, and the fact that children hated it tells you that the entire team did something right.Sometimes it good to watch something high brow when it seems like every other movie is something made for zoomers and their lame taste.

Also I would have loved to know more about the witch itself (the background story felt like it was not enough to unveil her character and intentions).
The actors itself (especially the old witch) I liked for their performance. But even they cannot make up for a unsatisfying script.I liked the witches house SO MUCH and the modern northern vibe it got... also the costumes felt kinda ""Holy mountain""-esque (Jodorowsky) and the bolt use of silluettes is just amazing.

79,theredsky,Gretel and Hansel Review,4,4 February 2020,"Gretel and Hansel feels like Oz Perkins is trying to make his movie feel like a Robert Eggers film but it fails at that. The only aspects I really enjoyed were technical ones. The one element that I felt was great was the score by Robin Coudert. It's intense and is the only thing that causes some scenes to have some sort of tension. The cinematography was pretty good. It felt atmospheric and made some scenes look very visually interesting. The production design was pretty good also. The sets look interesting and unique. As much as I enjoy the technical aspects, the rest of the film falls below average. The performances range from good to bad. Alice Krige did a good job as the witch. She had her moments but there really wasn't a whole lot to it. She was able to make her bad dialogue sound somewhat better. Sophia Lillis was decent as Gretel and Sam Leakey as Hansel was pretty bad. Their performances are made a little worse by the script. The script is pretty bad. The dialogue spoken between characters is extremely awkward and poor and can cause you to look at the screen and think, ""what the hell?"". The characters were uninteresting to me. There wasn't a lot to them that made me want to care about their struggles. The story and flow of events was very boring to me. Besides the visuals, there wasn't anything that was getting me invested with what was going on. The good thing though is that the film isn't even an hour and a half long so it isn't a pain to sit through but it felt a little bit longer due to pacing issues. The first act of the film goes by very quickly but the rest of the film is very slow. It attempts to set up the characters and then drags out their encounter with the witch a little too much. Overall, Gretel and Hansel may have some great technical aspects but its performances, story, script, and pacing really drag the film down for me.",Gretel & Hansel

This movie fell so far below that bar, it couldn't even see the bar from where it was.
Firstly, just like many others, I need to know why Gretel was the only character without an accent? Was it that the actress just didn't even want to try? Automatically that puts me in mind of Costner's horrible Robin Hood failure.
Perhaps in this version Gretel has Aspergers?
It seems like the filmmakers were so concerned with cinematography, they sacrificed a cohesive plot.
I dislike movies with rambling narrations dubbed over the action, this movie was full of them.
Why was everyone so eager to talk about turning Gretel out? She looks like a pre teen boy, yet everyone wants her to turn tricks?
I watch movies to be entertained, not to spend 2 hours trying to figure out constant symbolism and metaphors. This movie came off as a pretentious art piece, not a horror/thriller.

Gretel & Hansel is a damn fine slow-burn horror movie.The actors all have great chemistry, the direction and look of the film is spectacular/very creative, and there are legitimately creepy visuals.Does it have any flaws? If I were to nitpick, I guess some of the dialogue feels a bit odd and out of place with the period it's in. Also the movie didn't go as dark or as F'd up as I wanted it to.Still it's a really good movie and deserved a better release.

95,TheCasualReviewer,"So much potential, so little deliverance",5,3 February 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
A dark fairytale following Gretal (Sophia Lillie) on a quest to find food and work for her and her little brother, Hansel (Samuel Leakey). They stumble upon a woman who offers food and work that turns into some sinister findings.REVIEW:
This new telling of the old tale of Hansel and Gretal set a very intriguing and artistic atmosphere from the beginning, but somewhere along the way found its way into becoming what felt like a film doing anything it could to hit that hour and a half mark. There weren't enough new elements to this iteration that warranted a feature length film. An hour and a half is not long at all, by any means and I'm not saying it felt long, it just really felt like they were trying to build tension by creating a loop of the second act. A lot of ""this old lady is weird, but we have food and work"" and ""maybe she's not so bad, she seems nice"" that happens again and again. Another gripe I had were the accents. It seemed at times they were going for the mid-Atlantic/proper English accent and other times just a typical American accent. That's not a huge deal, but can be distracting. The acting was serviceable, but nothing spectacular and not the best performance from Samuel Leakey who played Hansel. I understand he hasn't been in much and is a child actor, but in a film of this maturity and with a focus on the young characters, I'd like to have a strong performance there. That also falls on the Director.CONCLUSION:
This film had a great atmosphere that set a certain expectation for me moving into the 2nd and 3rd acts of the film. The Director Oz Perkins, definitely has a vision and like the film I see potential in him, however, this film is one he'll have to go back to to improve on his mistakes. 5.5/10.",Gretel & Hansel
96,edlc1970,Maling no sense at all,1,7 April 2020,"I thought this was going to be a nice little horror movie, based on the story og Hansel and Gretel. But it was nothing like it. It was boring, confusing, weird and made no sense at all. The witch turns from older to younger and back to older again several times in the movie, and that makes no sense at all. And Hansel and Gretel have a strange siblinghood between them. And at the end, Gretel has some kind of PSI force??? Waste of time and makes no sense at all.",Gretel & Hansel
97,juliendussault,The cinematography is the only professional thing about this film,1,5 May 2020,"The cinematography is amazing, the acting is more like an elementary school production of the original story, if it was written by an edgy, feminist high schooler who wanted to ""modernise"" the story of Hansel and Gretel, but make it horrible and depressing for no reason other than to be edgy.This film vilifies men and makes them seem cruel and evil, while all the women, excluding G&H's mother who is an axe wielding maniac who believes that if you don't prostitute yourself out that you should die. The witch says that marriage is a shackle and Gretel can somehow use make-up, before it was comercially and conventionally used in the States, or even in Europe, i.e. eyeshadow.The rest is a cacophony of random, annoying noises and one boring monologue by Gretel as well as her random fits of rage that she takes out on Hansel.This film is utterly horrible and not worth anybody's time nor is it worth the effort to suffer through all of it.",Gretel & Hansel
98,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Gretel and Hansel Just Missed the Path Home,6,1 February 2020,"It was a dark and stormy night. The wind was howling like the banshees.... wrong setting. Welcome to medieval Germany. Yes, I know scary enough, but Stream to Big Screen dares to go where no other human dares, Gretel and Hansel. This week we volunteer to walk these young kids through the dark forest to bring you this ghastly review. Gretel and Hansel is an adaptation of the well-known fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel. The synopsis of the film goes as follows: ""A long time ago in a distant fairy tale countryside, a young girl leads her little brother into a dark wood in desperate search of food and work, only to stumble upon a nexus of terrifying evil."" Well, let's get to it.I think the best way to describe this movie is in an analogy that occurred to me last week. Picture it... Sicily... 1948.... wrong story. Ok, imagine you are going on a date with your loved one. You've picked this highly regarded but new restaurant. There's excitement because the reviews and recommendations from co-workers are all positive. You all get to the restaurant and just like the pictures showed, this place is swanky. You're table is ready at your reservation time, and you get sat in the middle of the restaurant. You see everyone's food and the fish looks fresh, the pasta looks hot and tasty, the veggies are fresh, and the waiters are on point. The ambiance is on point. You order. The food arrives. You wink at your date to say, ""bon appetit, babe."" Now, you're half way through the meal and the waiter asks if everything is ok and you respond, ""yes, everything is good."" It's at that moment you realize something is missing. You take another bite of your food, but you taste nothing. You think, ""That's weird. I can tell this is cooked well but I don't taste anything."" You inhale deeply to smell your food and the restaurant. It's at that point you realize that you can't smell anything. There isn't the slightest aroma in the air but you're nose isn't stuffed. You ask your date, ""Hey, is your food well seasoned?"" Response, ""Yeah, it pretty tasty."" You question, ""Do you smell the food?"" They respond, ""Yes, of course, and the kitchen smells pretty good, too."" It's at that moment, you realize that you are sick.This is Gretel and Hansel. The movie is visually very crisp and almost entrancing. The actors all seem to be doing a very good job conveying the emotions of the moments and hitting the lines. But then you realize you are sick. The movie for being advertised as horror, except for a couple early moments, is without fright. Yes, there is some general eerieness early, but by the end, you feel empty. Empty feels like the correct description for the writing in the movie as well. There is an early scene in the movie that feels like that creepy atmosphere is achieved, but the next thing you know the movie ends and you're like what were they saying in this movie again. Hollow, hollow, hollow. All for show.Now with that said, I did enjoy the new spin on an old tale, but I think they could've done more. I actually think making the movie only PG-13 may have hurt it in the long run. The horror elements could have been pushed further, but I realized they were targeting a specific age range with this movie that I'm not in anymore.Gretel and Hansel is a teen ""horror/coming of age"" movie that is shallow. Looks great on the outside but the content is just non-existent. The movie isn't bad but it isn't particularly inspiring or intriguing compared to the recent semi-horror films like Midsommar, Us, and Hereditary. This movie you can catch as a first showing matinee but ultimately is a better view for a streaming service night.",Gretel & Hansel
99,bluefim,Visually stunning,5,24 January 2021,"This film was one of the kinds that are more horror in theme than execution if that makes sense so ymmv but the best part was the skillful cinematography/art direction/set design. It is hard to describe it but I liked how there were choices that weren't so typical yet still looked strange or creepy. On the negative side the plot wasn't particularly well done, the accents and way of speaking were all over the place, and the music had a few oddly electronic Tron-like moments. Otherwise if you are sitting around, like horror, and enjoy looking at pretty things it isn't bad.",Gretel & Hansel
100,ryan_sy,A Visual and Sonic Treat with Little Substance,5,9 April 2020,"I agree with most reviews on this- the film was visually moving but the story line was poorly conceived. I found myself confused and shaking my head in disappointment at the plot, character development, and slow pacing. Another redeeming quality of the film was the musical score. I thought it matched the visual aspect of the film beautifully and was very dark.As many users indicated, this had the potential to be a great movie, but it fell short with a clumsy plot and lazy and confusing character development.",Gretel & Hansel
101,Spidenus816,Not For Everyone,5,30 September 2020,"I am not surprised at the mixed reception this earned. Like the director's other works, this is an attempt at ""art"" more so than an attempt at pure entertainment. Some viewers will not be able to tolerate the slowness of it. Others will appreciate the almost calming effect it can have. As far as the scares go, there were two brief scenes early on that caught me off-guard. The chilly sort of ambiance (which the autumn scenery complements well) stays consistent. I can't say, though, that the story writing enjoys that same consistency. In short, one might call this a horror film for old people.",Gretel & Hansel
102,diescobarmdq,Once Upon A Time did it better,5,23 July 2020,"As much as I love all fairy tales movies and shows, this one fell flat. The visuals and music are stunning, the setting is eerie and creepy, but the story itself was kind of meh... Been there, done that. Nothing new.
The actors are quite good too, the witch is super creepy as should be, but I didn't really know what she was doing, or what her true intentions were (did she want Gretel to eat Hansel?)
I just felt really disappointed",Gretel & Hansel
103,resireg,They ruined the Grimm Brothers' fairy tales,2,26 December 2020,"I deteated this movie. First of all, it has plenty of PC messages, like men are oppressors, women are oppressed, so they should get rid of their fathers and younger brothers. Then we have all those Anglicism, where the bad Witch mention the names of her victims, all Enlish names. The Brothers Grimm were German, so their stories happened in their homeland with German characters. Then we have the character in the middle ages wearing a feminist haircut, which did not exist back in the day.And the girl is quite rude. Normally starving people are very submissive, but her, she blames ""the Church"" for her misfortune. It is a cliché already to choose a villain that is totally absent from the story.Then we have the starving villagers that all look well combed, fed and dressed. We have black and Asian characters, when those only appeared in Central Europe in the 20th century. Where did those Africans came from?Then there are scenes that are just plagiarism from older horror movies like Nosferatu. Even the architecture of the house was bad, looking like a modern house.",Gretel & Hansel

The acting was also good considering the plot and dialogue they had to work with .Loved the dark filter and the dark feeling that was portrayed right from the start , but after that it does not have very much to offer .This story is a classic and it has a ton of potential to be a modern remake with a twist but it comes up short .",Gretel & Hansel

106,TakeUpReel,Could have been more interesting.,4,3 February 2020,"I like that this movie took a slightly different approach to the typical Hansel & Gretel story that we've seen is other adaptations. However, this decent concept fell flat, which made for an uninteresting story.I liked Sophia Lillis (Gretel) from ""It"", but she wasn't very engaging in this movie.Samuel Leakey (Hansel) was a poor choice for the role. He was little more than a prop for the story. I didn't care what happened to him once the witch's true intentions started to become revealed.Everyone used whatever accent they wanted - whenever the wanted. They didn't seem like they were remotely from the same area within the story.It seems Gretel talked like an American (so Sophia really didn't attempt any accent).Hansel sometimes had a (sort-of) British accent and sometimes not. His pronunciation of his lines were awkward.The witch was sometimes hard to understand. Maybe from her accent or maybe from the horrible make-up on her face.They could have done more with the little girl in the red hat. In fact, that would have been more interesting than the story they told of Gretel & Hansel.This movie is so-so. Perhaps wait until it comes out on cable or as a cheap rental.",Gretel & Hansel

112,gooseshaw,A beautifully made movie that's held back by an already familiar plot.,6,19 May 2020,"Great looking movie. Very atmospheric. But ultimately there's not much here. The setting and characters are all engaging (except for Hansel who just annoyed me pretty much throughout the whole film - I would've preferred a different actor), but the story is too simple and familiar.Early in the film we meet some sort of Robber Baron type character who wants to prostitute Gretel. He's eccentric and dressed by the costume designers in a lavish but dark and fairytale-esque costume. The conversation with him is engaging but he soon disappears from the movie.Later on the children come across what seems to be an abandoned house. Inside we meet some sort of undead person and a monster hunter. Both characters place our story firmly in a fairytale world rather that some sort of romanticized medieval one. These characters also help to shift the tone of the film into something slightly more sinister and dangerous. We never see or hear from these characters again.The last character we meet is the witch, who was cast perfectly in her role. The story continues essentially as the fairytale does, with one change - Gretel becomes some type of witch as well. This change doesn't happen suddenly, it was gradual and I wasn't quite sure how the story was going to end until it did.Still though, I wanted more. Unfortunately, the lack of creative writing pulled this story down. Nonetheless, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a dark, atmospheric movie, similar to, but not quite as good as Black Death (2010) or The Witch (2015)",Gretel & Hansel
113,Timbo_Watching,Boring and poorly written,5,5 March 2020,"It's surprising I haven't fallen asleep with this film. Sadly this film looks very nice, but the story and the direction were horrible. It entertained me a bit, but not so much.",Gretel & Hansel
114,thomasmitilis1995,TELL ME THE FAIRY TALE AGAIN...,3,28 April 2020,"PROS:Gretel and Hansel is a dark retelling of the classic story. Alice Krige gives a solid performance as the witch and she is very creepy and Sophia Lillis shows her acting chops once again. The cinematography is beautiful and the product design is impressive. The use of different aspect ratio is interesting and the use of lighting and colors is effective and creates a darker atmosphere.CONS:The film is very pretentious. Sure, there are so many wonderful artsy movies out there but there isn't something meaningful specifically behind this. The slow pacing and the lack of substance make the film so boring. Samuel Leakey is unconvincing as Hansel and delivers his lines in an irritating way. The mushroom scene is weird and unnecessary. The use of narration is useless for a simple story like this and the reveal about the witch has no impact on the overall story. Futhermore, the way in which the witch dies is so easy and the ending is so anticlimactic beacause it doesn't make sense why Gretel should leave Hansel.",Gretel & Hansel

Though he did not invent accounting, he was the first to publish a book in 1494 explaining the book keeping principles that Venetian merchants used.So what does this have to do with the movie Gretel & Hansel you may ask?
My dear fellow IMDB user, this fact above provides much more pleasure, exhilaration and sheer delight than what this sorry excuse for a movie can muster.Beautifully shot with dialogue that sounds like prose, unfortunately the story is utterly dull and ultimately unnecessary.",Gretel & Hansel

Everyone who was in the theater was bored and when it was over they said ""what a bad movie"" and they made fun of ""in administration you can go to get the 50% refund of the ticket"" hahaha. It does have a somewhat strange ending. Obviously each person has their tastes, I liked that it is not the classic Disney story but terror, something different, I also liked that within the terror is different from today's genre, the gloomy atmosphere it has is great, the sounds, OST and the performances too.",Gretel & Hansel
117,ivo_shandor,Finally getting good horror movies again!,8,2 September 2020,"Gretel & Hansel is horror movies done right. The best ones take a chapter from The Shining, The Witch, or The Lighthouse. Much like those films, our Grimm fairy tale is atmospheric, creepy, and gets under your skin. It's appropriately dark and violent, as it should be. It's a proper horror film that just doesn't have a creepy doll or a slight shift of the camera to another pointless jump scare. It'll probably make people sick or scare the hell out of them, and that's what makes it great. It feels like it came straight out of the 70s, down to the opening credits and the overall feel. It's a creep show, with everything calculated to make goosebumps appear. Great cinematography, production design and the acting sells the horror. Everything about it is creepy and dirty, and I love it. A good twist on Grimms fairy tales.",Gretel & Hansel
118,Larsii90,BORING and a complete waste of the potential,4,1 June 2020,"I knew this was gonna be an artsy and weird kind of film by the trailer, but I was hopeful they could take the story and turn it into something different and really scary.

119,TheLegendOfThe42,"Looks nice, feels forgettable",5,28 April 2020,"In an attempt to create a unique title and to score some feminism points, someone thought that ""Gretel & Hansel"" would be a great name for this film. And to be fair, this is not the worst aspect of this overly long and kinda self-indulgent film. Even better, there are some genuinely original and beautiful shots in here, so in a way I feel torn.If you watch movies for the visuals and enjoy getting lost in beautiful lighting and great production design, this is one for you. If you also like tension, suspense and a story, you might consider skipping this one.No need to go through the premise again, I guess, so let's just focus on the key elements. The acting was decent to good, the cinematography beautiful to at times brilliant, but the writing and character development was pretty awful and boring. The music tried to be bold and different, but ultimately failed to carry the beats of the movie, which made it stick out awkwardly at times. The editing was fine, but the film should have been shorter.This feels like a film that could have, no, should have been so much better, since the elements are all there, but they feel scrambled, rushed, like they belonged in more competent hands. I can only dream what a Terry Gilliam or Guillermo del Toro could have made out of this.Have you ever had some beverage that had some really nice flavour at the base, but was watered down, had too many other unfitting ingredients and was too carbonated and only came in 1 liter cans? Yup.",Gretel & Hansel

140,nyanbatcat,"Terribly fascinating, fascinatingly terrible",4,10 April 2020,"Gretel & Hansel is a very interesting movie that utterly fails in many ways, yet delivers a very unique and admirable in other ways. It always seems like the movie tries to sabotage itself by ruining most of its good things.It wants to be takes seriously and tries to be artistic/creative and sometimes even succeeds at it, but ultimately those moments fall flat because of scenes that are either known horror/thriller tropes that can´t surprise you in any way (such as: creepy, well-dressed little girl giggling while running away in a dream sequence that might not be a dream sequence) or are simply so bland, that the contrast between those good and bad scenes almost makes you laugh.Such a irritating contrast can even be found when it comes to the soundtrack which is a droning synth. You know, the kind of soundtrack usually used by sci-fi films or by 80s themed movies like bladerunner. Except this time its played IN A FAIRYTALE.G&H offers a new spin to the story while at the same time stays more or less faithful to it and has a beautiful cinematography that gives the pictures a fresh and fitting look. But yet again these gritty dark images become muddled with glaring red lights that, again, look like they are taken from a sci-fi or 80s movie. It is also a bit irritating that the story seems to be set in the industrial era...why? Why do that if apparently your color palette and content fit better in the time the original took place. Changing the time it takes place absolutely changed nothing except that you have to figure it out first. Brilliant twist right there.The beginning of the movie felt very rushed, hamfisted and didn´t add anything to a build-up. Two sentences as a voice over (this movie uses voice overs anyways, so why not?) could tell you why they had to leave home and can´t return there. That alone means that the first 13 minutes are utterly boring, irritating to watch and unnecessary (except to pad out the short runtime). In those 13 minutes there also is some very terrible CGI, that looked terrible even while it was only vaguely lit by a pin light in the night.
Theres another scene I want to highlight because it is so useless and features bad effects and that is a scene where they eat fly agaric and the mushrooms look like they are made of silicon foam and were painted because it is so terribly difficult to find such a common mushroom.To underline how artsy it is, the movie doesn´t want to use the conventional ratio, but unlike in movies like ""a ghost story"", it doesn´t seem to have any real reason for it.There are also some themes of emancipation and women empowerement, such as:
the title that this time names Gretel first; Gretel having a Tomboy haircut; a slimy rich guy that is more interested in her body although shes applying for a job; and then later in the movie the witch shows her ways she can grow stronger. Recent movies handled empowerement so poorly, so blatantly just to please their audience and be able to say its progressive. Gretel and Hansel did not do that, it felt very fitting in this story. BUT, yet again, the movie slaps itself in the face, because those empowrements are a mixed bag, because it is portrayed as (at least potentially) evil.",Gretel & Hansel
141,tanyatzatmary,I had low expectations.,1,3 August 2020,"And they still underwhelmed me. I expected it to be bad from the edgy name change to put the female name first, I predicted every other woke trope along the way. Tbh I was surprised the characters were white passing Ashkenazim and not browner hued. I get that they don't cast white people in movies anymore (and haven't for a long while), but I expected more white erasure present from something so woke it'd change the foundational name of an ancient tale.",Gretel & Hansel

144,helenmcguin,Dis-appoint-ment,3,15 April 2020,"I've been waiting to see this for ages, only because I loved the director's previous two outings 'The Blackcoats Daughter' & 'The Pretty Young Thing that lives in the House'.After seeing 'Gretel..' I feel that someone in Hollywoodland watched those earlier great films, recognised Osgood Perkins' talent to create creepier than creeps horror, then proceeded to hire him to make a kiddies flick to educate boys & girls on how to be girls & boys.Only positive was Alice Krige, the actress playing the old witch. I remember her from an old movie called 'Ghost Story'. She's a natural creep, pity she didn't have a better movie than this to make a reappearance.",Gretel & Hansel
145,marcusgrant-86630,"Tons of Atmosphere, but Too Little Excitement",6,6 February 2020,"Gretel & Hansel starts out promisingly, but soon falls into the recent tradition of having to over-explain its villain's evil to the point where they stop being frightening. The idea of a hungry, child-eating witch lurking deep in the woods who lures two children into her den of terror is an effective premise and has been since the original story was told hundreds of years ago, but by dulling a lot of the story's sharp edges, this adaptation feels a little anemic.While the themes of child abandonment still linger in the background, they're not as present in this re-telling, which is also unfortunate. After failing to land a job at the home of a creepy lord, Gretel returns home to find out that her mother wants her and her younger brother, Hansel, out (presumably because she can't afford to feed them anymore). The two siblings set out on their own, through the woods, until they find a house that houses tons of delicious food and a devious witch who intends to fatten Hansel up and eat him. She takes a liking to Gretel and helps her unlock dormant powers she never knew she had.Styled a bit like The Witch, Gretel & Hansel is brimming with opportunity right from the start. Every frame is gorgeously composed and dread drips from every single second of the film, but the script is what really disappoints, never really frightening us. Perhaps it's the PG-13 rating that keeps things safe and kid-friendly, but even the themes of child abandonment have been toned down. As mentioned earlier, we do meet the children's mother, but she's on screen for maybe a minute and we never get a good sense of why she feels compelled to kick them out of the house. This is quite a switch from the scheming parents in the original story who knowingly abandon their children in the woods due to their own selfishness, which would have been a far more effective way to begin the story.The witch is also given an elaborate backstory that humanizes her somewhat, but also takes away a lot of her sinister edge, which is a shame. You never really know what her motives for Gretel are. Is she planning on eating her as well? Who knows?Gretel & Hansel is far from perfect, but the beautiful cinematography, pulsating synth score, dread, and the performance of Alice Krige as the witch should keep your interest throughout.",Gretel & Hansel
146,calivsey,Skip It,4,5 February 2020,"Gretel and Hansel attempts to elevate the classic fairy tale but ends up suffering from a narrative that is more convoluted than compelling.

154,brian_clay,"Very captivating, for one and all.",8,24 November 2020,"I usually consider a film rated here at 5.3 as a possible stinker, but something to at least fill an hour or so if needed. I was very pleasantly surprised when I still had interest after 15-20 minutes. I couldn't understand all the low ratings until it occurred to me that the majority of them were probably from film viewers who think the genre of horror can only come from flesh eating zombies or dystopian societies of the future. This film kept me watching if for no other reasons than it wasn't ridiculously dark, and I could actually hear and understand the dialog. What a concept in filmmaking these days!The creepiness was palatable throughout. The cinematography and sets were very well done and saying that it was atmospheric in more than one way certainly describes it correctly. The constant background score many times unconsciously added to the uncomfortable feelings of many scenes. The rolls of the two young actors were portrayed excellently, and the Witch made my skin tingle at times. To remember and relate the original fairy tale, though not an exact retelling, allowed it all to come together for me. Its feel wasn't quite edge of your seat but it sure kept my interest, and even gave me a white knuckle or two. Not the greatest I've ever seen but I'd be willing to bet The Brothers would approve.
Grimm indeed.",Gretel & Hansel
155,Krush_Burner,A dark fairy tale for adults,6,30 January 2020,"Gretel & Hansel is the classical fairytale originated from German sources, but this film first of all is about contemporary society, albeit the story is set within a fantasy setting. The script basically follows traditional narrative of a sister and brother lost in the woods and trapped by a witch in disguise, but underneath lies a detailed social commentary on women's place in society, feminism and search of the self. Oz Perkins frames this film as a coming-of-age story, blending horror, fantasy and drama through suspenseful mood of a constant menace hiding somewhere behind the scenes.The visual part is no doubt the strongest element of the film. The forest and witch's house are unforgettable pieces of design and camerawork, added by the creepy musical background. There's not much gore, but lots of slow-burning tension, which is anticipated by the audience but not the main characters, since they're know nothing about the mysterious house and his inhabitant. There's also a dreams which haunts Gretel's imagination, and they're adding greatly to the film's bizarre atmosphere.The conceptual part is surprisingly noticeable, and is represented mostly through The Witch and Gretel's relationship. Perkins toying with well-known idea about connection between fear of the witches and women's independence, but he's rarely using a straightforward (anti/pro)feminist clichés, relying more on the character building, which says for itself. This is the point of similarity of ""Gretel & Hansel"" and Robert Eggers's recent horror hit ""The VVitch"", but this similarities are only thematically, not ideologically close.However, film definitely has its problems. The most obvious one is the pacing, the whole second act and part of a third one is moving quite slow, sometimes to the point of annoyance. Another problem is almost complete lack of Hansel's development as a character, which is weird even if film focusing mostly on women's part of the story. Finally, the script provides a lot of possibilities for a wild ride of imagination, since the setting is dark fantasy, filled with monsters, witches and nightmares - but it seems that Perkins barely using half of this potential.Still, the film stays on a high level as a piece of a classical dark fantasy tale, but made in a modern world and for modern audiences. Not great, but decent work.",Gretel & Hansel
156,danielbrown-47106,An honest adaptation,7,30 April 2020,"The story we all grew up with is cleverly adapted into a more honest and realistic occult/witch craft themed film with excellent, but unexpected choice of plot and music. It's always easy to scrutinise without having eyes for the subtleties or experience to empathise with, but the detail is here in this film and it is full.I'm pleased to say this one is certainly nothing like the gore you can expect from many Horror movies. It's barely Horror at all to be honest, though it could be considered Thriller, similar to Doctor Sleep in a few ways.In the same ways it's similar to Doctor Sleep, it's touching on real occult based possibilities which makes it a) less fake and b) far more scary knowing this is kinda real.The take away message of the movie is still the same as that of the original story (to question and be careful about what those giving wish to take).. but there's really quite enough changed from that original story to make it interesting. Although I would have loved to have seen a modern adaptation of a house made out of candy, I'm sort of pleased I didn't..To put your mind at ease, all the witches I've met and know to this day are alright, they're all about supporting the Earth and all its inhabitants, living a much closer version of homeostasis than many and rather than eating children they usually prefer to grow their own food in a nutrient dense garden, favouring greens over meat as they actually enhance connection with divine light. I have no doubts, however, that there's some like Anakin Skywalker who're immersed by the dark side.. and the way the dark side is depicted in these recent witch themed movies is perfectly plausible.So keep your wits about you out there! exercise a healthy degree of discernment always, just like the young apprentice witch of this film.",Gretel & Hansel
157,med-01081,GGG gretal gretal gretal,5,27 December 2020,Ok so what we have here is a classic attempt to make an artsy film with a flimsy plot and some decent acting. Let me start by saying the cinematography is actually awesome. It captures the feel of the time its set in very well. The witches parts are very well done and proves that this little gem had some potential to be pretty big if some more thought and time was put into the plot instead of having to unravel what was goin on as i kept asking myself whats going on....Hansel was awful. There i said it. Moving on. Gretal and the witch carry this film and do it some justice. All in all not a bad little attempt at fairy tale horror with some very nice shots. A worthy watch but expect plot holes and some dry spells.,Gretel & Hansel
158,josephbrewster-88279,"Smart, moody, and relevant",8,5 February 2020,"Read the negative reviews and you will see a long stream of ""too slow"", ""I fell asleep"", ""didn't make sense"", ""not scary"", and various other criticisms which typically plague these kinds of movies. So, I'll save you the trouble: if you are looking for action, jump scares, or special effects, look elsewhere.If, however, you are open to a darkly witty meditation on gender roles, particularly womanhood, with beautiful photography and a rich soundtrack, I think you will like this one. I did.I hate to defend a movie by labeling it a slow-burn psychological horror, because I gravitate toward those labels and revel in the atmosphere created by movies like this, but it does serve to draw a distinction between films like this and films such as Insidious, It, or Get Out, all of which I love for different reasons.To enjoy this movie, you must be willing to think, and think rather hard-not because the plot is so muddled, but because this film caters To people who already think deeply about social dilemmas, suffering, coming of age, and that insubstantial sub-layer of existence which most Hollywood films wrap up in a nice bow and hand to you, so you, the viewer, have little work to do. This film is not so convenient. What does it mean to be a woman? Is the power good or evil? Are men a blessing or a curse? Is there kindness in the world or only danger?There are moments the movie misses, but not by enough to make me feel it fails entirely. The acting, filming, and execution overall deserves praise and, for the right audience, will create a huge impact. How big is the right audience? Not huge, I would guess, but I for one am grateful movies like this get green lit and funded, because they deeply affect me.I came away considering the themes and underlying questions, and truly moved in ways an Insidious can't move me. Sure, I like the scare, but I've been scared more than I've been moved by horror, which is all the more reason to love these rare narratives.Bravo.",Gretel & Hansel
159,amandagellar-31077,A Mix of Good and Bad,6,29 March 2020,"You're unlikely to see better shot, more atmospheric film than Gretel & Hansel this year. Each frame looks like a painting and one can only imagine how much care and thought went into making each image pop. Unfortunately, the horror element of this film isn't as intense or frightening as it should be, turning the scary, child eating witch into more of a tragic figure and peppering the film with way too many elaborate, but uninteresting nightmare sequences.Alice Krige's performance as the witch is excellent, but she's not given a lot of support from anyone else. At best, everyone else is inoffensively bland, not making much of an impact or doing much to bring their characters to life.The film's pace also feels erratic and there are huge chunks of the film where absolutely nothing of interest is happening. Many scenes feel like padding to bring the film up to feature length. One leaves the film wondering if Gretel & Hansel might have made for a more interesting 30-minute short.",Gretel & Hansel

Some don't like because of high expectation that expected killing, vampires, monsters or violence, rather than a forest adventure of sister and brother. Also the end of the story was so quick.Witch & HanselThe witch in (G & H) was totally different from the original story, can't tell she was good or evil. She still had evil side that used power to change parts dead bodies of children to enormous delicious food, but also had good side that taught and guided Gretel how to find own potential power.

164,evetilly,Pretty and Empty Fairy Tale,5,5 October 2020,"Stunningly beautiful to look at, but the pacing is too uneven to even get into the story. It's still the basic story of Hansel and Gretel with two siblings forced to fend for themselves after being abandoned by their parents (this time, it's just their mother who literally screams at them to leave the house in an abrupt sequence) and they're taken in by a seemingly kind woman who lives in the woods who might have more sinister intentions in mind.You'd think things would get more exciting in the 2nd half once the title characters encounter the witch, but it's the opposite in this film. I found myself pretty interested in the story for the first 30 minutes only to be let down by everything that unfolds once they get to the witch's house where the pacing comes to an abrupt stop and the film begins relying on bizarre dream sequences to remind the audience that they're watching a horror film.At least it looks beautiful and the music score is creepy.

168,jimmyhoover-55861,Outstanding Visuals,6,8 February 2020,"It was about time for another, more serious adaptation of Hansel and Gretel. It's long been one of my favorites of the Grimm's cannon and it lends itself the easier to a horror adaptation. Unfortunately, this one doesn't always go as dark as it probably should and trades in scares for coming of age drama, long silences, some inaudible dialogue (a la The Witch), and endless dream sequences.If you like dream sequences, you're in luck, because there are about 400 of them here. I think we spend more time with Gretel in her dreams than we do with her in reality. There's also some very questionable and unneeded narration by her character throughout that just annoys more than informs.Visually, the film is practically perfect. The set design, costumes, lighting, and shot composition create quite the unnerving mood that the script constantly struggles with. Make no mistake about it - the technical aspects of the film are the highlight and it's a classic case of style over substance. The script never really seems to know what it's trying to say or accomplish. There are a few attempts at girl power feminism, but it feels undercooked and more like pandering than anything meaningful about female nature.By the time the film finally comes to life, it's already over and you might feel a bit underwhelmed. It might still be worth seeing for production design and cinematography hounds.",Gretel & Hansel

Many of its meaningful, Pagan messages come from the dialogue of the witch, such as, ""Think less, know more."" Gretel is on the precipice of knowing her potential - knowing how to use her intuition. And the witch, although overcome by the darkness herself, helps Gretel to realize the power she has inside. The witch let darkness and power overcome her balance. Gretel, on the other hand, wants to use her power for good, but things aren't so black and white in the realms of maturity and magic. To top off the poignant allegories and endless metaphors of this beautifully shot film, the score (Music by Rob) really drives the vibe home. This is one of my new favorites.",Gretel & Hansel

174,Rageypoo,"Interesting story, great acting, poor execution.",3,3 February 2020,"I watched a trailor but for the most part I came into it with a blank slate. I didn't read the original from the Brothers Grimm though I knew of the tale for the most part I was ready to experience this take on it.First, the acting was great. I didn't like the writing, the narration was out of place, but the actors did a fantastic job. I felt like I was in a real world and was blown away from the start with the beautiful scenes and the sharp writing between gretel and her mother. When the children left home however, things just started doing downhill quickly.In the next scene, gretel and hansel find some abandoned home and have a rest, but then out of nowhere this...undead...thing leans forward, moans and starts chasing them. Gretel was going to abandon her brother but in the last moments, turns around and strikes the ghoul, its eye falls out and of course it is still alive, and she is stunned! As were we, it made NO SENSE to the story and that's basically where it goes from here.There are many points in the story where things are shown that ultimately don't pay off or are so out of place it will insult your intelligence. I suppose if you want to think VERY deeply, this undead thing might show us in some way that ""hey magic exists in the world"" but it's completely unecessary, the witch eventually shows that to us and does it in a really interesting way.And yet, there are so many other moments that are just such a suspension of disbelief that it leaves you with too many feelings to be satisfied. At one point gretel is bound to a table, forced to watch her brother die, but using her newfound gifts, she is able to speak to her staff and strike the witch down, which she wouldn't have otherwise been able to do. Then in the next few seconds, she summons the strength to break the bindings...SO WHAT WAS THE POINT OF NEEDING THE WITCHCRAFT POWERS!?I mean seriously, at no point in the movie do we ever see a barn or stable near this house, and yet at the end of the movie she sends Hansel off on a horse...WHERE DID THE HORSE COME FROM!? They just seemingly pull stuff out of nowhere and it comes off as sloppy.I didn't mind it, my mother hated it, so rating appropriately.",Gretel & Hansel

176,Skeauxsha,An Interesting Take On An Old Classic Story,8,6 August 2020,"Having just watched this movie while still fresh in my mind, I have to say overall, not too bad at all. The cinematography was very good, and it was pretty creepy as well all the way through. You knew something is justifiably not right, and there was no way to put a blackened finger on it.
Speaking for myself only, I am glad that movies are being made that have a slower tempo. In this way the pitch of the movie becomes a chess-match between Gretel, and the witch. Interestingly enough although sparsely decorated, the pace of the movie allows you to ""look"" around more, and observe all the details of each scene. Again, slowly and creepily building up to something. As something is going on... constantly.
The characters were fairly well played, although I'm giving a lot of latitude for the younger actors. They were both just a little shy of being good in their roles.
Hansel's character, played by Samuel Leakey, was reminiscent of Jake Lloyd
(who played a young Anikin Skywalker). In both cases the performances were lackluster, lacked any emotion, or were not quite right for their roles respectively, again putting it kindly, granted both are / were child actors.
Next Gretel, played by Sophia Lillis, also could have been a little better, however again, I'm being generous to the young actress.
Lastly, the Witch. Played by Alice Krige (awesome performance!) and Jessica De Gouw (awesome performance!) held the entire movie together very well. Such a kind, and sweet, and generous.... Whoa!!!
Didn't see that coming!
In summary, this movie isn't for someone with attention issues. Sit the heck still, put down your phone. Quit fidgeting around, and enjoy a differently paced movie experience. I know I did, and I'll be watching it again soon.",Gretel & Hansel

The feminist angle is already clear from the title, since the fairytale this movie is inspired by is called Hansel and Gretel, not the other way around.
Hansel is reduced to a useless, whining little brother. A burden to Gretel who is the main character of this movie.
Ofcourse there is an absent father and the only white males are the zombie and the pervy guy at the start. The witch keeps talking about how bad men are and how they should fear women.
I would recommend watching hansel and gretel: witch hunters. That movie also has a original spin on the fairytale but it has action, fun, humor and does so without degrading all men.",Gretel & Hansel

180,misslilia84,hmmm,5,30 January 2021,Why did greatly mom go insane? where did the beautiful girl go if Holda was her mother? not a lot is explained or what was explained doesn't make sense. razor thin plot. the movie is visually stunning and creepy though. i'll give it that.,Gretel & Hansel
181,red-nevermore-smith,Superb work of art. Beautifully shot.,10,18 April 2020,"If you appreciate amazing film making you will love this. Quirky and beautiful cinematography, modern with a 70s feel.
The dialogue is incredibly poetic as if it was written in the 18th century.
I rarely give a 10 star rating (reserved for Alex garland/ Denis Villeneuve type films)
But this is such a beautiful retelling of a classic. I'm going to watch it again and again.
Those people who have issues with this film are probably fans of the Hansel and gretal witch hunter trash that came out a few years ago.",Gretel & Hansel
182,silverthingz,A Snoozer!,4,10 May 2020,"Cheaply made.
Definitely not a traditional story. Slow movie.
Gretel is an older child 13-16 yrs old? Mostly about her. Seemed more like a stage play.
I only watched it through just to get my monies worth.
Glad I didn't waste my time and money watching it in theatres! The witch actually said ""My Pretty"" to the girl! Eyeroll! 🙄

183,ViciousCXY,Disappointing,5,24 May 2020,"The movie is beautiful, it's packed full of eye-catching shots that immerses you into the story -However I think the visuals are what saves this film a lot.Throughout the film the choice of vocabulary is very poetically driven which definitely stays true to the time period the story takes place; this however became a little irritating *to me personally.*Following on from this, there were a lot of parts in the movie which seem to have been but there for really no reason, or at least are not given any explanation behind them:
-Why did the mother threaten to kill them?
-What/who was the zombie-like man who got killed?
-Why was the huntsman there, in the middle of the night to save them from this particular man?
-Where were the wolves there were warned about?
-What was with the mushroom scene? Was it just a nod to hallucinogenic drugs?.. Maybe it was a scene to bring about a theory that a lot of what happened was an hallucination?.. or was it just there because it could be?..The movie also progresses quite slowly, I was hoping a deeper delve into the little witch girl who the story seemed to revolve around until the end, when we find out it really revolved around her mother.All in all, I think this movie leaves you with a lot more questions than answers.. Which in the end left it feeling a little disappointing.",Gretel & Hansel
184,johnhow-82589,A Horrifyingly Confusing Macabre Tale,4,10 April 2020,"It is a genuine struggle to stay awake through this artisanal of a fairy tale that goes no where. It's a visual feast with classy cinematography. That's all there is to this horrible tale. These days, I really don't know where all these writers and directors have birthed from but perhaps from the dark and horrifying macabre forest of farcical creativity. Why talented actor like Alice Krige and one or two from this tale would participate in such a horrifyingly poor tale of a movie? And the creator's of this tale think it's an art house gift to a fractured world. It is not. It is but a great disservice to cinema lovers. Dont waste your time and money on such horrid tale of a movie.",Gretel & Hansel
185,westerfieldreviews,"""The Cautionary Tale of Stranger Danger""",6,2 March 2020,"""The Cautionary Tale of Stranger Danger""Oz Perkins brings back to life the classic Brothers Grimm fairy tale, ""Hansel and Gretel"" with a modernized artistic approach where the sum of its parts is greater than the whole. ""Gretel and Hansel"" is a dark fantasy film that pulls its general plot from the classic fairy tale and it shows as writer, Rob Hayes does his best to reinvent the universe but ultimately pens a story that fails to impress. The entire cast and crew come together to craft one of the most visually stunning films of the year that will leave you marveling from frame to frame. ""Gretel and Hansel"" is truly a film of two tales; on one side we experience a story that broaches strong themes and establishes a fascinating world that is sadly never further expanded upon, while on the other hand, we watch in awe as the astonishing aesthetics of the film's world wash over us like delicious eye candy.
Audiences may think they know the story of ""Gretel and Hansel"" because of their knowledge of the 1812 published fairy tale, ""Hansel and Gretel""; but they would be wrong (only partly). The story picks up by telling the tale of a young girl in a village that fell terribly sick, and with no other option, the girl's father pleaded with an enchantress who saved the young girl's life. However, there was a cost. The girl was cured, but she was cursed with the knowledge of knowing the future. The girl's reciting of her own premonitions led to her being abandoned deep in the dark woods never to be seen again. Once the recounting of past events concludes, we are introduced to our titular title characters, Gretel (Sophia Lillis) and Hansel (Samuel Leaky) while the two are meeting with an estate owner inquiring about a housekeeping job so that Gretel may financially support their mother and household. After the home owner's intentions are realized, both Hansel and Gretel flee the house to relay the news to their mother. Unfortunately, their mother does not take kindly to the message and threatens to kill the children if they do not leave immediately. With those final words, Hansel and Gretel embark onward to find a suitable home to occupy. Along their journey, they encounter a handful of new characters and places until they reach the house that smells of cakes and sweets. The children are greeted by the witch Holda (Alice Krige) before being welcomed into her cozy home that is filled to the brim with delicious foods from all across the land. However, not all is as it seems within Holda's isolated cabin as Gretel's growing suspicions of distrust become confirmed with every passing day. It is here where ""Gretel and Hansel"" diverges from the original source material and sets itself apart by expanding upon and creating an entirely new world of fantasy and horror.
""Gretel and Hansel"" was without a doubt my most anticipated film for the month of January, because I was completely sold on the creepy marketing that was released prior to the film's opening. I am quite familiar with the original fairy tale and was excited to see a fresh original take on it. Tragically, I was disappointed. ""Gretel and Hansel"" writer Rob Hayes had the luxury of a starting point in the form of the original Brothers Grimm tale, and to his credit, he managed to take that and apply it to a brand new mythology. However, it is a true shame that the film is never given the proper amount of time to explore the darker depths of this fascinating mythos. The narrative differentiates itself from the original tale with a bevy of new concepts that dive deeper into Holda's (the witch) lore in ways that have never been done before. Hayes also takes the time to further develop Hansel and Gretel by gifting them with distinct personality traits that separate the two and transform them into functioning characters that grow and change over the course of the film's ninety-minute runtime. With all of that being said, Hayes does not earn the bulk of the blame as I believe two strict factors led to the film's weak narrative. For starters, the film is rated PG-13 and given its subject matter along with the style and tone in which it is presented, the film should have been rated R. The creepy imagery sprinkled throughout and eerie design of the world would have been better realized had the film's rating changed. The second factor that contributed to the film's general disappointment was its lackluster runtime of only ninety minutes. Based on everything showcased within ""Gretel and Hansel"" it is clear that there are larger aspects of this world that were either forced to be shelved or were mentioned and discussed but only briefly. Hayes lays the foundation for a myriad of alluring ideas, it is too bad many of these concepts are hardly given the time to expand and grow.
""Gretel and Hansel"" features a narrative that fails to impress; so much so that it was nearly wiped from my memory almost entirely. In spite of that major flaw, I believe the one thing that can be unanimously agreed upon is that ""Gretel and Hansel"" is a phenomenal film to look at. Christine McDonagh (Art director) and Jeremy Reed (Production designer) combine their efforts to create one of the most visually interesting environments ever seen. Every aspect of the film that is visually represented feels like the coherent vision of a singular individual. The characters and sets are all completely distinct from one another; whether that is the opulent appearance of an estate, or a dimly-lit house in the middle of the woods, to a witch in all black with a pointed cap, or a broad hunter draped in a cloak. The world presented in ""Gretel and Hansel"" is visually enticing where no two things look alike. Galo Olivares shines as the leading director of photography (whose previous works include 2018's ""Roma"") on the film as every frame is lit to perfection. The hues and tones that range from warm to cool may at times feel the same from moment to moment, but Olivares masterfully ensures that every frame is lit just enough so as to not highlight too much, maintaining the fear that we may never know what is lurking in the shadows. Leonie Prendergast serves as the film's lead costumer designer and she does a fantastic job creating striking looks for many of the characters featured in the film. Each and every character is gifted with unique visual traits that make them stand out in memorable ways. On the whole, ""Gretel and Hansel"" is a film that features a specific visual flavor that is unparalleled by anything in theaters.
""Gretel and Hansel"" is a mixed bag of film that leaves more positive impressions than negative. The film suffers from a less than stellar plot that finds itself more often than not slogging through moment to moment with extremely apparent pacing issues. Yet nevertheless, ""Gretel and Hansel"" heavily relies on the old adage of ""show don't tell"" as it offers up an impressive world that will leave you yearning for more. With exceptional performances from the entire cast and solid direction by Oz Perkins, ""Gretel and Hansel"" is a treat for the eyes that could have been very special had a few minor alterations been made. A film worth the price of admission for the visuals alone.Final Verdict: C+",Gretel & Hansel

191,jeffreyoliverrock,Wow! That Was Boring.,4,2 June 2020,"Excited as I was to see this movie, I was pretty disappointed. The movie is very beautifully shot and the sets are gorgeous, but take out all the super slow character movement and long shots of the sets, and this movie would be about 20-30 minutes in length. I'm all for films with minimal, or even no dialogue, but something worth seeing has to be on screen to make it work. Beautiful as the sets are, they aren't really enough to hold interest by themselves or just with a character walking through them.I thought the last 10 minutes or so of the film had some interesting moments, but for most part, I yawned. Although the characters are pretty bland, I will say that I think Sophia Lillis and Sam Leakey acted well, and Holda the Witch was a creepy character played well by Alice Krige. I was going to give the movie a 3, but decided on a 4 because it actually has an ending. Other than the visuals, very little to see here.

If I have to walk away from a movie saying what the hell did I just watch, that's not a good thing. But cinematography and acting were above average. Maybe it was bad editing and the parts that make this a story are on the cutting room floor. Maybe a director's cut will come out and explain all. (Unlikely) Maybe a sequel will come out and fill in the blanks. (Not likely with the reviews I've seen on this) Rating of four is solo based on cinematography and acting.",Gretel & Hansel
194,Kremer-Thomas,It's not a Horror Movie at all,8,10 April 2020,"When I started watching the film I expected one of the usual horror flicks with a fairytale motif. But the film took a very different turn. There were only a few moments that served the horror aspect.It was more the story of a young woman who starts to find her own way in life.
A coming of age, if you like. Metaphorically disguised and depicted in an extremely complex way.The actors are grandiose throughout. I liked the actress of the witch, she balanced on the narrow path between cynical emancipator and caring grandmother.
The change of the witch from the driving, emancipating force to the opponent in the last part of the film was unexpected, but still understandable.The only thing that was a bit irritating about the movie was the set, because you could never be sure in which time the movie takes place. And where the hell did the horse come from at the end of the movie?All in all I can recommend the film. However, not for horror fans who are looking for some jumpscares. You only get them very rarely.",Gretel & Hansel

The history of cinema is so full of strong woman characters that it is absurd to create a new genre focused on empowering women... plase, open your eyes: they just want your money!This movie is boring, slow, apparently beautfully shot... (but not, is merely an empty exercise in cold stylism!) But what annoys me is the fact that Hansel has been reduced to the role of a bug flying around whereas SHE is the only charcater there.... When i read the tale as a chld I always thouht the two siblings had more or less the same age, and both of them were clever enough to fight the witch, but the fact that they made Gretel almost twice the age of Hansel so she could be the only hero in the movie... agh, such a clumsy display of utter rubbish!And let me finish this with Pedro Almodovar's words about the subject ""You cannot revise cinema with the ideology of the new feminism"".",Gretel & Hansel

Everything about writting is wrong, dialogues are terrible and most of times meaningless. The acting, especially of the 2 main characters, is really, really bad (I know a lot of people will disagree, but someone has to say it: Sophia Lillis is a mediocre actor). Honestly it looked like the writer and the director were trying to make this feel like it delivered a message without actually delivering it. A famous screenwriter, whose name I can't recall, once said ""you don't have to give to your story a meaning, you just have to make it look like it does"", and, however I can't completely relate with this opinion, I can pass this, if done in the right way...

202,beccabentley,How to ruin a beloved fairytale,4,5 May 2020,"This had potential. And really, you should be off to a flying start already by using a well known and loved fairy tale as your baseline. Well, baseline is the correct word. Because this only got off the mark with its cinematography and setting. It could have been amazing. But it tried to be too different and had too many jarring or absurd elements. The only parallels to Hansel and Gretel were the children being cast out in the woods and a witch with a house of plenty (and even this part where the children looked through the window at the wonderful feast laid out on the table I felt was ripped off Pan's Labyrinth). I wouldn't have minded the changes to the original story but they weren't good changes! And it made no sense that the children even had the names Hansel and Gretel or were supposed to be siblings when Gretel spoke with an American accent and Hansel with a British one, while the witch was Irish and all the other children that had been killed had Western names!
PLOT SPOILERS now. List of anomalies and disappointments!
The identity of the witch herself was VERY confusing. The film started off quite well with a backstory of a young girl cured of an illness by an enchantress but left with a telepathic gift that also led her to kill people by thought alone.
But, other than showing up in Gretel's nightmares (and it became difficult to tell when she was dreaming and when she wasn't!), WHAT happened to her? I assumed that she must have grown up to be the young, beautiful witch we saw down in the big basement but THAT turned out to be witch who was the mother of the girl just making herself look young again! And since the witch was the mother of the girl, WHY did they use a different actress for the mother when showing a flashback? Did they change their minds as well? Was it supposed to be some kind of twist? Well it was the most poorly executed ""twist"" I've ever seen. And what even happened to the Enchantress?! JUST CONFUSED? Yes, I was!
The witch had supposedly ""gained"" her own dark powers by killing and eating her other innocent children. And the mother of Hansel and Gretel had threatened to chop up Gretel when she had refused work for a nearby, rich pervert. What's with all the murderous mothers?!
There were lots of things that just seemed to serve no other purpose than to draw out the running time e.g. a ghoulish man who chased them and was never explained, meeting a helpful hunter whom they never saw again, eating magic mushrooms which made them hallucinate, Hansel practising with his axe (what WAS the point of this if he was never actually going to use it in terms of the plot?)
Then it was just silly how easily the witch was killed at the end. Why would the witch just pin Gretel to a table by her sleeves when she was already aware of and had been teaching Gretel how to harness her own powers!?
And why have a huge ladder up to a cage above the fire that Hansel had to climb to? This was so clearly contrived to give Gretel time to save him!
The acting was passable but Sophia didn't do as well as she did in IT (possibly because the script was also so poor) and I didn't really feel a connection with either of them. When Hansel went missing, there was no sense of urgency or even really much of a sense that she was playing along to appease the witch.
It's a shame because it could have been a really good, well shot, gothic-feeling horror story. But all I could think was how much time I had wasted watching it. I've been generous with 4 stars because it started well and looked great.",Gretel & Hansel
203,AndruVoss,Definitely not worth watching,3,13 February 2020,The atmosphere of the film was great and setting was amazing. But the storyline was boring and the editing was horrible.

Even though it was slow and hard to keep up. It doesn't matter what change a child bookinto something disgusting and disturbing to watch. Witch story is more advanced in director way to tell the story of witch. It also shows that place they live in; isn't happy and joyful place be in.It shows how much dark and curse that change people behavior. It tells how much different from the book than it really is.It contain really good thriller into this film. That got me startle in my chair. The cast is fantastic. Sophie is really great performance in the film. She was fantastic of keeping Gretel behavior in film. I enjoy the ending and plot twist also.I'm give it 8.9/10 of it great story telling from their version of this famous children story,Gretel & Hansel
205,ghettodub,Review: 2020s Gretel and Hansel,8,3 February 2020,"2020s Gretel and HanselGretel and Hansel is our latest entry from Osgood Perkins, son of the legendary Anthony and director of my favorite movie of the last decade: The Blackcoat's Daughter. Our limited cast features Sophia Lillis as Gretel, Sammy Leakey as Hansel, and both Alice Krige and Jess are Gouw as Holda.And now, to our friends at IMDB for our synopsis:A long time ago in a distant fairy tale countryside, a young girl leads her little brother into a dark wood in desperate search of food and work, only to stumble upon a nexus of terrifying evil.A ""nexus"" of terrifying evil you say, IMDB? I do love your wordsmithery.Our story begins with a tale of a young family, and sickly daughter, and the choice they make to save their daughter. Skip some years ahead, and we meet a young Gretel and Hansel of Grimm fame. With things not looking good at home, they head out to try and find a new life. After some hardship, mushroom trips and dark shapes in the night, they come across a home filled with food and a seemingly caring owner. Are things what they think? Is something darker lurking?My opinion: this was exactly what I wanted it to be.
While based on the classic Grimm tale, Perkins takes things in a different direction, which I appreciated. I would have been totally ok with it sticking with the original story, but I really enjoyed that it did its own thing. It is still, largely, the dark fairy tale that so many of us are familiar with, but they made it their own.The score was incredible, and almost every shot in the film is perfectly done. The cinematography on whole was fantastic, which I expected. The opening tale of this poor cursed young family was so good...I try not to expect much with movies, and this was a tough one. As mentioned earlier, The Blackcoat's Daughter is my favorite horror film of the 2010s, so my expectations were through the roof. I'm usually good about keeping a lid of that, and I didn't feel disappointed.There are some things I could nitpick, but I try not to do that much as I don't feel it's fair. Just because things don't go exactly as I would like is a silly way to judge the film. We all have things we would change about everything, so it's better to judge on what is there as opposed to what isn't.Gretel and Hansel is a lean and well-paced 87 minutes, and I would have gladly taken another 20 minutes or so to stay in the world that is being built in that strange little cottage. So yeah, that would have been great. But I still loved it even without that.I hope that people get out to see this one. While I'm guessing it will be an incredibly-limited run, it would great to see this film be financially successful as I would love to see more movies in this style. There is so much great content from classic fairy tales that could be re-imagined, and you can sign me up for it all.So, to me, Oz is three for three. I'm at atmosphere guy, and he just knows how to create it. Im a fan of his, so that could be part of why I enjoyed it as much as I did. And I'm ok with that.I'm looking forward to a second watch when this drops, because then I'll take a more analytical approach. But from just my first enjoyment watch, it nailed it.Rating: 8.5/10",Gretel & Hansel
206,jmjcunningham,Nope,1,23 August 2020,When I saw the title of this movie I thought that it would be very suspensefull and interesting to watch with a lot of horror and excitement but it fell short on all of those expectations with just a boring storyline and it was not what I expected at all.,Gretel & Hansel
207,tayangangambar,Slow burn adult horror adaptation of a classic story,6,2 February 2020,"This movie adapts from the Hansel & Gretel tale with a few creative liberties to make it a more adult horror flick with some twists from the original.Here, the sister, Gretel, being the elder teen sibling and the prime lead worked well in this adaptation whilst Hansel plays as the young kid brother who needs her care and protection. The old lady of the house that entice them with food & shelter and held them hostage was well performed. The general premise of story is the same as the classic story, except with a darker horror and modified twist to the story.It is a slow burn horror movie which is more of a drama than a thriller where paying attention to the dialogue is important. For those seeking a fast pace horror with overly gore-fest and/or dramatic moments will be fairly disappointed. It felt a bit like a play. The film score also creates a sense of monotony.The cinematography was great with beautiful and artsy shots and the acting was good. However, the accent of the siblings were mismatched as Gretel has a mostly american accent for the whole movie whilst the Hansel had a mostly british/irish accent for the first half of the movie.Overall, it is an alright movie with the simple basic premise of the original tale done like a slow burn indie-style drama movie with very few actors. I would say wait for its dvd/blu-ray/stream release unless you are open to slow-pace monotonous style films.",Gretel & Hansel

212,defmuse,"Flaws, but good single-watch movie",7,17 May 2020,"The movie, for me, starts off slow. Some of the camera-work seemed really out-dated. And what really put me off were the accents of Sophia Pills & her mother (in the movie). With the beautiful similies + dialogue, I felt their ways of speaking were too contradictory to the time period & rest of the characters' dialogues. Everyone else's dialogue allowed me to fuse with the dark period of the film's setting, but then their accents + form of speech would snap me back into the ""now.""However, the good: beautiful sets, 90% of the camera-work was gorgeous, Alice Krige is phenomenal, and I liked the new version of this childhood tale. The eerieness of the sets definitely won me over.Personally, from all the negative reviews I've read, it seems like they were written by people who were expecting more ""action"" in the end, but probably are the same critics that criticize action movies for having little substance.For general horror fans: enjoyable one-time watch, great acting, beautiful set-design.

It's beautifully shot and mastered together, and I truly didn't hate the storyline either. Was the potential to do more there? Yes. Did that ruin the film that we did receive? No. My only real complaint would be the acting abilities of the young boys character. They could've done better in finding a more suitable child actor for his role, in my personal opinion. Other than that, this film is the perfect movie to watch on a rainy day snuggled up in bed.",Gretel & Hansel
216,nino-scholz,Good execution can't save it.,3,3 February 2020,"Saw this with my daughter by her choosing. I was ready for a good horror flick as it had been awhile for me. There is quality here with the acting and overall production, but the entertainment value ends up being minimal. It started out weird and mildly intriguing, settled into weird boredom, and finished with some mild satisfaction that was too little too late. The plot never truly gets going until the final moments, and the scares never really come. This might be worth a rent if you are the type to focus solely on an acting performance, because i thought the 3 main actors did a good job, or even camera shots and such, but as a package it never really grabbed me. If we weren't in the recliner style seats my butt would have been hurting 30 minutes in waiting for it to end - it's that type of flick.The music is choice 80's B horror movie style - could have been a perfect soundtrack to a better horror flick.",Gretel & Hansel

219,rudyardellis,Comes So Close,6,9 February 2020,"The concept of a more horrific version of Hansel and Gretel appeals to me and it seems like such a given, but Gretel & Hansel doesn't quite hit the mark. It has enough mood - that's for sure - but there aren't any true scares to be found in the film and its overabundance of cheap dream sequences grates the nerves after awhile.On a basic level, the story is the same as the one you were told as a kid - two siblings are forced out of their home, wander the woods, and come into the clutches of a child-eating witch. There's some attempt at trying to make this more of a coming of age story for Gretel, but the messaging is so mixed up that you can never really tell what they're trying to say or get at.It's not a home run, but it's also not a complete disaster either. The production design, cinematography, music score, and Alice Krige's performance are reason enough to at least give it a go. One just wishes they'd put as much thought into the script as they did the visual aspects.",Gretel & Hansel

Everything is art or greatly done here: the casting, props, colors, atmosphere... According to the reviews many viewers expected something else. I expected nothing. Great by the way that there are almost no jumpscares. That's the most boring and worn out effect in horror movies, yet you find them everywhere. This team apparently wanted to make something differently and they succeeded. It's a story without gore or violence, it's just very creepy.

1. If you are too dumb to understand a movie, re-wtach it or go do some research before you vomit your ignorance on the keyboard.
2. Considering that more than half of the population is made up of idiots, this movie is not for everyone. If you're going to watch this, watch it with an open and sharp mind without the expectations of a mainstream entertaining thriller.

229,maxim-delaet,Very possitive surprise!,7,2 February 2020,"Most people rate this super low because they have no clue what's good, what's bad and how to properly review a movie. Their standard of a good movie and reason to view this one: ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" is one of the biggest disasters I've ever seen. The only reason I watched this one in theater, is in fact because people who liked crappy movies like Witch Hunters were apparently hating on this one. Great reviewers actually called this movie ""decent"", while metacritics even tend to use the word ""good"" reviewing this!And YES, this movie definitely beat all others of its kind, which isn't really a difficult accomplishment on its own. The acting, word plays, and atmosphere were good. The directing and scenery overall was decent to say the least. Somehow, it felt like the movie missed something though...**MINOR SPOILER**
There was some unused potential in the pink capped daughter slash main character of the evil fairy tale. As well as the cat that drew some attention throughout the movie, but just seems to be an ordinary cat.Overall, it was a good, not yet great movie.

The techno music (which some find inappropriate for a film like this) gave the beginning of the film a eerie atmosphere. As time went on, I found that this scary atmosphere was abandoned for an incoherent story that itself did not know where it wanted to go. Nevertheless, I thought the film was definitely worth seeing, thanks to the eerie begin and the horrific performance of the witch.

233,athlbr3,A Reexamination of a Classic German Folklore,7,6 February 2020,"This film definitely is not for everyone, especially (what I suspect to be) a large segment of the traditional horror fan base. This film's main focuses are conveying the atmosphere through its (slightly) oppressive and alien visuals and telling a story about female independence in the times of Middle Age Europe, when and where a young girl's choices in life were either to be a kitchen-bound broodmare or a nun (not all that fundamentally different in the Western world until one-and-a-half centuries ago, actually). Holding and practicing strong notions of self-pride and (insolent!) independence since before the film's story event starts, Gretel (Lillis) is determined to make her own way in the world.I really like the film's reexamination of the morals and public perception of The Witch, Holda (Krige & De Gouw), for there is certainly some truth in many a feminists' complaint that (some) men fear powerful women.Sophia Lillis makes for a solid lead actress, but I have to say that Alice Krige commands the screen better, if for no other reason than her longer experience in her craft. Sam Leakey (as Hansel) is okay, but just an afterthought, at least to me.Where the film does fall short is relying too much on mood and visuals to stretch a pretty straightforward story to 87 minutes. As it barely contains any action scenes to speak of, I feel that 70 minutes would a more appropriate running time mark. Also, a few of the plot points are brought up without any followup, such as the things Hansel encounters when he wanders into the woods by himself.To all the man-children whining about the film being too politically correct (PC) due to its title and other supposed indignities, I urge you to pick your shriveled brains and actually remember whom the protagonist is, because it sure ain't Hansel.",Gretel & Hansel
234,gillianronnie,"More pretentious long drawn out exposition in the vein of A24 ""horror"" films though mostly just Dull drama.",5,30 January 2020,"We all know the story and this offers a very dull portrayal of the the old tale. It follows the same tired and bored formula that overrated films like The witch, hereditary, blackcoats daughter (same director). Attempts at artsy cinematography with few nonsensical shocking visuals spread throughout to be able to call it horror i guess. The main actress Sophia Lillis is fine and brings some actual talent to the overall film and there are some nice shots of the forest but this is just another failed attempt at thought provoking horror that just feels like it's trying to be an A24 smug film.",Gretel & Hansel

It's much darker than the sanitized mainstream versions that have been produced so far, bringing it back closer to the original Grimm tales.If you enjoyed movies like The Expendables, the last season of Game of Thrones, or have the attention span of a 8yo with ADHD, do not waste your time.

Story wise I have seen worse recently and this is a bit on par with the shallow written trend of films i've seen lately. I swear, it feels as if everyone has forgotten how to tell a story. It feels as if they threw in a skeleton framework and said screw it by not fleshing it out. Hey, they got the title that they wanted and I guess that was good enough for them.Someone needs to get a clue and realize that producing a film of this quality isn't going to help in promoting their cause.

No there are not more than two or three jump scares but that's what makes the movie more haunting and less schlock. Great beautiful imagery, well acted, and creepy. Just a creepy vibe throughout. Oh and for the folks saying it's a woke feminist movie ... come on. If it was that I certainly would be the first to critique it. It's not. Stop looking for silly reasons not to like it. Only reason I'm not giving it 9 or 10 stars is because some of the dialogue is a bit strained and some of it was hard to hear but all in all this was a really good film.",Gretel & Hansel

This was none of that, but more the type that requires careful concentration, patience for the story to unfold, because it does, and the ending makes sense indeed. Its a good story about good triumphing over evil, purity of soul and thought and the power of good will. Its very gothic yet there are small modern twists that intrigue; such as certain nuances in the architecture or pieces of clothing, jewelry, I'm not sure if that was intentional or an oversight, but it added to the fantasy.",Gretel & Hansel

247,jon5000,Fake artistry,3,12 April 2020,"82 minutes of faux art. Everything in this movie is completely contrived. The camera work resembles every other, better, arthouse horror film. The lighting (vibrant blue contrasted with orange(yawn)), framing, angles, everything about this movie is trying too hard.The dialogue is 'old english' only to the point that it provides some confusing, puzzle like exchanges, but with little other reason. They use modern coloquialisms like 'another one bites the dust' and 'finders, keepers'. It is all fake and pointless, and really makes you appreciate writers like Robert Eggers who completely immerse you in the language and dialogue, even if it makes the work a little more inaccessible. At least he is consistent in his convictions. This movie clearly is not, and is using this faux colonial English to appear more deep, artistic and mysterious than it actually is.When the main character delivers her narration there isn't an ounce of this 'old english' to be found. She speaks in modern English.Sofia in the lead is dreadful, with slilted delivery and wooden emotion. She tried her hardest, too hard. She is channeling Meryl Streep in her dramatic scenes, probably thinking this movie would be her major dramatic breakout, but it comes across insincere and forced. And in a world of people with English accents, speaking pseudo old English, she never has an accent, which futhers her character's, and her performance's, falseness. It makes her stand out from the cast in the worst way possible.It's a movie that tries too hard to be something, but fails at almost every turn. Pity, because there are some interesting ideas here. Maybe with a better writer, cast and larger production budget, this movie could have joined the ranks of The Witch, Hereditary, The Lighthouse, Midsommar, Climax and Suspiria 2018. Instead it is a very poor imitation of those films and so many others that came before.Pity.",Gretel & Hansel

249,s-stetsko,A bit weak in content but STRONG in flavor.,8,12 July 2020,"I have come across many analysis over the years in which it is pointed out that 'Hansel and Gretel' is really just a story about Gretel. It can be read as a commentary on traditional women's roles in the family, a female coming of age tale, and can be looked at from a Freudian perspective as well, all beyond it just being a favorite children's story. Gretel and Hansel jumps right in to these deeper readings, as well as being a nice take on the traditional tale itself, all while weaving in a sinister mythology all of its own which is sustained as nicely symbolically and through allusion as it is revealed through direct narrative.These things alone give it a strong backbone, but boy oh boy, it doesn't stop there. Really good performances from the female leads give it more credulity, and it is... well... to be honest, a feast for the eyes. Beautiful cinematography, moody, atmospheric set designs, subtle detailing, all combine to create a film that is a treat to watch and manages to manifest a truly creepy tone, even for people who might not be so into the more esoteric aspects of the horror of the film. And it is esoteric, and this may make it less enjoyable for some people. It periodically slips into almost surrealistic territory increasingly as it develops, and for those who like a more direct and conventional horror it might be stepping too much into the realm of an art film. But even if you ultimately decide that is the case for you, I don't think any true movie fan can walk away from this one with complete contempt or regret. For many it will be seen as a beautiful story well told, but if not, at the very least, you will admire the art of it. That alone will make you walk away thinking you had spent your time well.",Gretel & Hansel

Nothing to do with the slow pace or lack of horror, it was like an amateur film school project but with a good camera, good lighting director and amazing locations. The script was pretentious and the acting abysmal other than Gretel and the witch but again felt like they were reading out a film student's first script. The score was great but way over used the direction was ok but amateur still, almost seems like the opening which, was brilliant, and the endIng were directed by someone else.

253,sara_shaw,Artful Atmospheric Horror with a Wide-Release Budget,8,31 January 2020,"If you love A24 horror movies like ""The Witch"" or ""Midsommar"", then you should dig this. This really feels like what a super-dark occult fairy tale would look like on screen. The focus is on Gretel as a young woman in a super-patriarchal world who both yearns for and rejects the power the witch is helping her own. The cinematography is not only beautiful but really accentuates this internal struggle. At the same time, the screenplay is coherent and not preachy- more show than tell. Sophia Lillis as Gretel is perfect here and really anchors these themes, and Alice Krige as the Witch is not just a one-note baddie. The direction reminds you sometimes of Lynch and Jodorowsky, but if you've seen Oz Perkins' previous two films, you will know what to expect- he's fantastic and unique in this day and age. A master of the slow-burn.Recommended for the more discerning horror fan. I love Blumhouse movies too, but this ain't that. Not a slasher or a thriller or a jump-scare-a-minute type.

This movie is not the greatest thing you'll ever see, but it takes a relatively short and simple fairytale and makes it an interesting and spooky film. There are things to complain about, but for me the positives outweigh the negatives without question.The music and scenery harken 80s and 90s horror and fantasy such as Legend, Pumkinhead, and The Dark Crystal (among others). Though admittedly this movie isn't as good as any of those, it still captures their essence beautifully. The actress playing the witch does an excellent job and in my opinion makes this movie what it is. Her scenes are the best in the film!If you like dark movies with a Gothic flare, and/or you enjoy fantasy movies with great visuals and attention to scenery, then you really should give this a watch.",Gretel & Hansel

This movie is an amalgam of at least three Grimm fairy tales. I think the producers chose to call it ""Gretel and Hansel"" for two reasons. First it's Gretel's story. She's the protagonist who learns about who she is just as all women learn about themselves when they go through puberty. As the witch implies, she must free herself from the influences of men in order to realize her potential. I was fascinated by the story and thrilled by the cinematography and the music. Be warned.

258,DroxineArdana,Beautiful and extremely hollow,5,30 April 2020,"Gretel & Hansel, a moody adaptation of the Grimm Brothers fairytale, looks incredible but proves itself to be a remarkably superficial affair. The setting is confusing ( why does Gretel speak in a modern American west coast accent while everybody else speaks in variances of old English?) and the story ambles around. There's this inner monologue from Gretel that sounds like voice over from an insurance commercial and there's pretty awful stilted performances from Sophie Lillis and Samuel Leakey throughout.Not all is bad - Alice Krige as the witch is delightful and the music is wicked. Production design and cinematography are masterful and are evocative of The Witch or The Village but lack the authority of those films. With tepid dialogue, weak story and pandering themes, Gretel & Hansel would be better served as a short film or a multimedia art piece in a gallery than a 87 minute narrative film. Check out Hansel and Gretel (1987) instead.",Gretel & Hansel

I don't mind if a movie doesn't overexplain, but this one had annoying plot holes. The acting was good overall but Hansel just got on my nerves, I was hoping he'd be eaten by the witch!

I am a big fan of Sophia Lillis and I thought she killed it! I think this movie is very underrated. I was dying to see it (with high expectations) and was not disappointed. It's a very interesting take on the original fairytale. Overall, this movie was great and I would definitely watch it again!!!",Gretel & Hansel

""Gretel & Hansel"" is a visual masterpiece, every single scene is a painting and every detail is a pearl. Unfortunatley the script is very slow and cryptic in its development.
Only for real cinema lovers, for those who see every detail and for fans of Refn and Lanthimos. Not for kids searching for usual jumpscares.
Looking forward Perkins' next move!",Gretel & Hansel

The acting was good besides 'Hansel'. In conclusion, don't waste your time on this horror movie, cause it's nothing new and not well directed.",Gretel & Hansel
268,kamranRa,Gretel and little boy bore you and the witch to death and beyond.,3,31 January 2020,Well this movie has nothing to do with Hansel and Gretel really they just used the name to get publicity. Hansel seems like an afterthought in this movie without no real impact.The movie is really really boring and even though it is only 87 minutes it feels like a life time. This movie is like a dj who keeps building up and up and up but it never drops the beat never and you end up blue.Buying couple beers will provide much more entertainment for you than watching this.,Gretel & Hansel
269,AshisanAhole,Looked pretty.,3,17 February 2020,This movie was really pretty to look at. I really did like the witch concept they were going with being not the typical type of thing. And I did love the passing it on angle they were trying to pull into the story.That said there isn't much else to enjoy. This movie kind of drags by. The end comes all at once and doesn't make too much sense in my opinion to what we've been watching through the whole story.,Gretel & Hansel
270,rtbuxb,Excellently done!,10,9 April 2020,"I'd seen the trailer and I couldn't wait to see this movie. And I was not disappointed. I don't understand whats with all the haters, I think they have less sophisticated independent film taste. The heck with them, I say watch this movie and see if yourself. Truly one of the creepiest, most menacing soundtracks I've ever heard perfectly set against equally creepy cinematography. Excellent acting and rather arcane use of the narrative put it in a class by itself. Check it out.",Gretel & Hansel
271,christopherbirk-ny,What should a real film be?,9,8 April 2020,"Ever since I became aware of this film I was excited to see it. It looked beautifully shot and had Alice Krige - one of my very favorite actors - in a spooky role.
Interestingly enough I looked up all the - mostly VERY negative - reviews of this film and it raised many questions with me. A lot of complains about the ""missing plot"" and about how it was more artsy than a ""real"" film. What makes a film real? What SHOULD the ingredients be in order for it to be acceptable? Mainstream maybe? ... Isn't that what so many of us also complain about?
This film was indeed beautifully shot and had a great performance by Alice Krige - it also had a killer soundscape and sound design in general and every shot was a piece of art in itself. So yes I enjoyed it very much. And either my definition or my acceptance of what a film is is a lot broader than others' or I am just satisfied with visuals and sounds being the thing that carries a film. Either way, is that wrong? Hollywood throws up 20 films every month where the SFX are the ""star"" and we seem to be just fine with that. So maybe there wasn't an elaborate, complicated story with twists and turns. Maybe that wasn't the point! I am somewhat saddened that so many people - in my opinion - missed what this movie could do, and did do to/for me and I am sure for others. Much like when we as people seem to have a long list about how certain other people ""should"" be, we also seem to be very sure of what a film ""should be"" and seem to not accept whatever lies outside of that box. I think it is a pity and I encourage anyone who likes art, colors, music and sound to watch this film (in a dark room with the sound way up).",Gretel & Hansel

288,Parentalguide44,5 out of 10 OINKS,5,31 January 2020,"When the most memorable part of a movie is how many times characters 'oink' like pigs, it's not a good thing. The movie is pretty. That's about it. The story goes nowhere, the plot is unengaging, and I was left underwhelmed. The film tries too hard to be artsy, stylish, and taken serious. Unfortunately, this makes the movie feel slow and pointless. Movies should evoke emotion, making the audience feel something- whether it be sadness, fear, or excitement, etc. This one felt equivalent to sitting in a 3 hour long college lecture on cinematography. I'm not gonna say don't see this movie, but I will say that if you REALLY want to see it, I recommend you wait until you can rent/stream it to save your money and potentially time if you decide to turn it off.",Gretel & Hansel
289,pajamawolfie,A boring movie with great lighting and sets,4,15 February 2020,"If I used one word to describe this movie, it would be ""boring."" There are long stretches of Gretel and the old woman sitting at a table, talking slowly and deliberately. What they're saying isn't particularly boring, but I'd rather have the filmmakers show it instead.One thing this movie has going for it is fantastic lighting and set design. All of the light was colored somehow. I don't think that there are any windows that let in regular white light: it's tinged blue, it's a stained glass window, it's glowing red from the inside, etc. They also had great window frames, using them to literally frame the character that is speaking, or to look inviting or ominous as the situation calls for it. Silhouettes in the woods all stand out in sharp contrast. The sets are cool too: lots of triangles. The witch's cellar looks like it came from a different movie, but it works because it's so unexpected.Okay, so it's supposed to be a scary movie, and I think it did a good job at being creepy. There weren't many jumpscares; instead it had a malevolent atmosphere. Lots of menacing silhouettes watching from the woods. And the scenes in the witch's cellar are suitably terrifying. Occasionally something gross happened, and since most of the movie was characters sitting in a room talking, I was thinking ""finally! Let's see some more!"" But sadly, there wasn't much more. Give us some gory flashbacks already! Make the trees bleed! Anything!Not much background or ambient music, and I think it would have been better if it had had more.I didn't really feel anything for the main characters. I wasn't particularly rooting for them, nor was I wishing they would die. No matter what happened, I would've been okay with it, because I just didn't care. They weren't stupid, just desperate. Gretel knew something was wrong with the house, but they were literally about to starve, so they ate the food that was offered to them.A few other small things: Gretel had an American accent, while nobody else did. It was hard to figure out what time period it was set in. Two brief scenes using shaky cam were jarringly out-of-place. What happened to one important character was unclear (it's a spoiler).I think this story would've worked better if it were condensed into a Twilight Zone episode.In summary: If you're into lighting and set design or art direction, watch it. Otherwise, there's not much for me to recommend about ""Gretel & Hansel."" If you want a movie in a similar vein that is much scarier, watch ""The Witch"" (2015).",Gretel & Hansel

But my happiness was short-lived. The movie started great but speedily turned BORING.
I couldn't stop watching it because I felt that something amazing would happen in the next minute, so I continued, with hopes that it'd get amazing.
And, that was how I watched the whole movie. Was hoping that the quest to learn the ways of the herbs and Earth and learn how to use an axe would be filled with terrible magic, sword fighting, witch burning, great horror and so on.
But there was none, it lacked action, there was little magic, no horror, Just plain narrative. Plus the fact that I had a real battle to stay awake.

304,pgregory_photo,Film is not dead! This isn't Hollywood,8,18 August 2020,If your a cinematography fan like myself you will love this film beautifully shot and composed and the atmospheric look and feel to every shot is superb. Forget Hollywood and special effect this is art cinema. It's tells the pagan version of this tale and is amazing. I knew nothing of this film before I saw it the review were mixed and I didn't fancy it but from the first few scenes I was captivated by the cinematography the lighting the mood the darkness of it all.If you want massive special effects and big name actors that can't act then this film won't appeal to you. Don't get me wrong I like a good mindless film every now and then usually whilst I'm busting doing other tasks like eBaying. But I still love art house film and this reminds of art in every sense. I glad I gave it chance as it's amazing.If you liked the film Mandy or dog ville or like lard Von trier I'm sure this will appeal to you it's like Stanley Kubrick filmed a Disney film in the sense of the shining and I loved it. My girlfriends into her history's and paganism she wanted to watch it was like meh. But I'm so glad I did watch it. It's a film you can study and see so much in the shots and colours. It's creepy without being unrealistic and don't expect it be shiny happy people because it's not. It's an interesting tale and I and intrigued to find out more about the original tales behind a lot of classic,Gretel & Hansel

Did they put it in just to have a black guy in the film? Otherwise it didn't have anything to do with the movie. It isn't really a fairy tale either. Typical recent Hollywood where they use something historical to get you interested but the movie really has nothing to do with the real Hansel and Grettle story.It Is a coming of age story and if you look at it that way it is a decent movie.

309,saurabhakanxa,Perfect score as a horror film,6,14 May 2020,"The first thing you notice about Gretel and Hansel if you've read the Grimm's folk tale Hansel and Gretel is the switching of the leading, heroic, saves-the-day role from the male to the female character. That is an expected move as per the modern world order, and I do not feel the need to turn it down any more than the need to encourage it. However, this movie also intends to be a morality tale about how a girl ought to realise that she is powerful and could decide to use her powers in any way she deems fit. That's where I would start deducting stars from my rating. Simple argument: If a movie encourages a man to practice power, it would be met with heat from the world. And I for one cannot believe in teaching to a particular sex something that you wouldn't teach the other(s).Coming to the point, as a horror piece, the movie works well.

316,iagolivesforever,Boring and Not Scary,4,20 February 2020,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was intrigued. It looked like a scary, unique take on the classic fairy tale. Turns out, it was neither scary nor unique; it was almost 90 minutes of build-up that amounted to nothing.The film's ""unique"" take is to tell the story from Gretel's point of view (hence the title). Here, she's a developing teenager, and her brother, Hansel, is a kid that she has to take care of. As in the original story, they stumble upon the witch's house, and she invites them in and shows them hospitality while concealing her true intentions. It is here, though, that Gretel learns that she too has witch powers, and the witch takes a greater interest in her. The witch convinces her that her brother is a hindrance to her growth as a witch and forces her to watch him be cooked in front of her. However, Gretel uses her powers to kill the witch and save her brother, only to then send him back to the woods as she stays in the witch's house to develop her powers.I really wanted this to be good. The cinematography is great, but that alone doesn't make a great film. You need relatable characters and a compelling story, and unfortunately this one has neither. Also, for a film that's under 90 minutes, it sure has a number of unnecessary elements. There's a black guy that kills a zombie (I'm guessing), and after a short scene immediately afterwards, he is never seen or mentioned again. There's also a story about a little girl that has some importance to one of the characters, but it has very little importance to the overall story.I had a real problem with the film's ending. I feel it would have made more sense if Hansel was the same age as Gretel. Hansel is still a kid, yet he is ousted from the house by Gretel and left to fend for himself. And we're supposed to empathize with her? Congratulations, Gretel! You get to stay in a nice house and become a witch while your little brother likely starves alone out in the woods or gets eaten by animals! Great job!Overall, it's a great-looking film, but that's all it has going for it. It's boring, not scary, and just generally not very good. Would not recommend.",Gretel & Hansel
317,lookingnewthings,I do not understand the vitriol thrown at this movie.,7,1 February 2020,"I don't get why people are hating this movie. I thought it was a fresh take on a simple fairy tale. The ambiance is great. It gives a truly creepy vibe throughout the movie, from beginning to end. The acting was good. Loved the witch. She just stole the show.I have my nitpicks with the movie like the sawed not chopped tree, and Gretel's hair being short instead of long. For the time period, no girl would have had short hair without being burned as a witch. Sorry feminists, but women back in the day did not cut their hair because they felt like it, and they certainly didn't wear it shorter than their brothers hair cut. But that's minor nit picky stuff that just took me out of the vibe of the movie, cause I'm a purist. I like realism. That's what makes a movie scary to me.But honestly, the story was decent. The acting was better than average. The ambiance was awesome. The cinematography was amazing. What do people expect? If you were looking for a slasher flick, then this isn't for you. Was it overly scary? No. Was it creepy? Yea. Did it make me jump? No. Very few movie titles can boast that one. But I liked it.If you are looking for gore then try another movie.

322,dmziontz,This is NOT a movie for the young....,8,4 May 2020,"I say that not because it is terribly violent, or bloody, or explicit in any way. I say it because it is a highly-stylized, artful interpretation of the classic fairy-tale that will not be accessible to those seeking the simple story of selfish stepmothers and easily fooled witches. It's not that easy, and, because of the absence of childish, pedantic storytelling, our own judgment is called for.
In this deliciously spooky and metaphorically rich interpretation of the tale, we, just as the title characters, are given the choice of what to believe. Indeed, the central theme of the movie IS choice. The existential nature of these choices is a refreshing element that most movies quickly snatch away from their audiences. Fairy-tales, in general, are used as tools to teach basic morality. The good is clearly good, and the bad is unmistakably bad. This telling, however, is different because it allows the viewer to decide where each character falls along the moral spectrum.
No, this is not a children's movie. The weight of the choices that must be made are not for children. Life and death, goodness and evil, power and weakness, self-fulfilling desires vs. selfless acts of sacrifice; these are weighty determinations, and the film allows us to make our choice and then react to the choices made by the characters. There is plenty of heavy-lifting for the viewer here.
Movies this boldly self-sufficient are created as art of the thinking kind. No car chases or cackling, lascivious hags, or shining, virtuous heroes; only people doing what they must. Gretel & Hansel offers dark realities and the disturbing effects of how we choose to deal with them.
Visually stunning, and well-acted (Alice Krige's Witch is sinister and malevolent, fragile and honest), Gretel & Hansel lays itself out for the viewer like a beautifully tempting banquet set in a fire-lit room deep in the woods.",Gretel & Hansel

I think the concept was ok but if I was the leader of this project, the movie would be scary and it would be a bestseller in the cinemas (if we didn't had coronavirus in the world).

I went in with a solid knowledge of the old fairytale, and came out loving the version so much more.

331,djrw,"A classic dark-, and modern quest for survival and development.",7,30 January 2020,"Once upon a time (1970), I went to the Dutch fairytale park the Efteling for the first time, and I felt so scared, seeing the witch at the Hansel & Gretel's house 😨👦. That's how fairytales used to be, and -to my opinion- should be told. Intensely funny, touching, and sometimes creepy. Oz Perkins' (direction and co-writing) Gretel and Hansel Movie is free from the moral and peaceful Disney layers, and goes as dark as needed. And that's good because, as the outdated leader logo of producer Orion symbolizes, this must be a low(er) budget production. Only a handful of actors and a compact filming location... it comes down to acting and visuals. The colouring and photography is well chosen and visually attractive, supportive. The dialogues are not quite exciting, the narration is sometimes even tacky, but acting is performed well by the talented and bright Samuel Leakey (Hansel), cheeky/evil smiling Sophia Lillis (IT Movie) as Gretel and especially by Alice Krige (Silent Hill and the Borg queen in Star Trek) as witch Holda. This fairytale is a good take on the classic Brothers Grimm story, but Perkins & Hayes wrote it also as pilgrimage, a self development portrait of the adolescent Gretel, dealing with talents and her sweet little brother, in her way.",Gretel & Hansel
332,spacism,It held my interest,7,26 February 2020,"This movie is slow, and not much happens, and that is going to turn most people off. We never see Gretel and the witch engage in martial arts, and Hansel never gets to torch her with a flame thrower to save his sister.I went in with low expectations given that it is a horror movie with fair amount of bad reviews and was pleasantly surprised. It was very atmospheric in terms of the acting, the settings, cinematography, and especially the music. It held my interest throughout and kept me in suspense. I'd rate it superior in many ways to the horror films (low budget or not) that get theatrical releases that just feel like money grabs, At least this film feels like it had a vision and effort was put into it.",Gretel & Hansel

If you want amazing cinematography and just an overall well done film I can't recommend this enough. If you want a cheap scare, go see something else. Simple as that! Could it have been scarier? Yes.

I've seen the actress who plays Gretel in other films before (It, It Chapter 2, Sharp Objects) and she's always impressed. However in this film, I feel she wasn't given material that could've been transformed into something more engaging and interesting. The film seemed to want to be artistic, edgy, mysterious, however it failed to really allow for the characters to develop in any real or measurable way.There are so many unanswered questions but they don't make the film mysterious as much as it makes the film seem unfinished and showcase the lack of effort put into the script.Why did the mother lose her mind and throw out her children?
Why was Gretel fine with sending her brother back home alone to this clearly unstable woman and stay at the witch's house?Just another very disappointing film.",Gretel & Hansel

345,lapetitesophiemia,"Pleasing to the eye, but ultimately forgettable",4,1 February 2020,"On a ""visually-impressive"" scale, this film ranks comfortably high. What enticed me from the few previews that I had seen was 'Gretel & Hansel's' stylishly-disturbing visual vibe, and yet; upon exiting the actual film, I feel like that was the most that the movie had going for it.I'd often find myself becoming too absorbed in the lush oranges of the forest or the curiously ""dark-modern"" style of architecture to really get engulfed in the storyline. The performances just didn't really make me care.A different film that successfully marries its plot and characters' development with its breathtaking setting would be Ari Aster's 'Midsommar.' You sympathize with its main players, and experience a memorable oneness from the film's portrayal of human emotion + the landscape that such internal conflict takes place within. Unfortunately, 'Gretel & Hansel' lacked in characterization, which is what made its group of main characters feel more uninteresting than they should've. There wasn't much going on within the personality departments, so none of them felt drastically separate or particularly intriguing. I really liked Sophia Lillis in 'It,' but her Gretel oozed a jaded indifference throughout the film; making any semblance of 'growth' feel unbelievable. This movie felt too try-hard and miscast, and many lines of dialogue from the movies' few characters also felt difficult to hear or understand. There was some weird accent stuff going on (everyone had a different one?) that felt distracting and confusing... I'm not sure what they were going for in that regard.I can appreciate the feminist nod that the writers were trying to incorporate, and the creative spin on setting and design (plus, I always adore an imaginative twist on a classic story) but something about this movie just felt more empty than I would've liked. Not quite smart enough for A24, but also not 'trope-y' enough for casual scary movie fans. A better, eerier ""folktale-meets-Feminism"" film is 2015's 'The VVitch,' whose performances and atmosphere stick with you long after viewing. Sadly, I don't think this movie hit the same notes.",Gretel & Hansel

Slow and contemplative, creepy more than scary, and beautifully filmed, this movie is about creating and sustaining an atmosphere that modulates between hope and dread, beauty and ugliness, light and dark. It also weaves in threads of feminism and ecology. If you're sensing that Gretel & Hansel bites off more than it can fully chew, you're probably right, but it's a beautiful and thought-provoking sight to behold nonetheless.

Pros for me in this film include cinematography, direction, acting, and score. I give all of those a 10. I also think the story is solid and for the most part, follows the original fairy tale, The differences are necessary in order to keep the story going, and though they diverge slightly, the overall tale is intact. My primary con is the inner monologues that go on for Gretel and seem inessential when given the action we are seeing on screen. I truly enjoyed this flick and think that anyone who likes the Grimm's fairytale will find much to love here, I look forward to more from this director and would love to see more fairy tales brought to the screen by him.

If you're familiar with Brothers Grimm's story, and if you loved it as a kid, this one holds the place very close around it.GORY horror? Zombies? - Not at all, but grim as it can get. Very gloomy world, terrific atmosphere, but with its such high level of aesthetics you just can't stop gazing at. Cinematography is fantastic: every shot was painstakingly executed as if it was a painting. Characters and actors' performances are quite unusual for a movie, more like in eccentric stage manner. That actually fits pretty well into the realm of the Grimm's tale. So do the soundtrack.SLOW paced? Predictable? - Didn't mind. In its under 90 minutes run, the movie has a lot to tell and keeps your attention. Once both kids get to the witch, the short original story have revealed itself without a rush.

While last named one was an absolute free of finesse and rich writing, 'Gretel and Handel's surprised me with a fresh twist of the original fairytale, with amazing cinematography, set dressing, make-up. No unnecessary overdose of VFX, no silly scare shocks or gore, but actually creepy silent horror ( which in my opinion is harder to achieve than ordinary shock moments).
Is it slow paced, creeping and different? Yes.
Is it badly done or boring? Hell no!

I understand it displeases to a lot of people but it reinforces even more the fact that it isn't a fairy tale.It's a good horror movie but I think it could be even better by improving a lot of little elements that, together, are a little bit disappointing. For example I didn't liked at all the end, the storyline had a few of inconsistencies...I saw a lot of comment which said that the inversion of the names in the title is bad because it breaks the thought of the fairy tale we know and it promotes feminism but it is actually a good thing because Gretel & Hansel is not a fairy tale anymore. So I think the title matches well with the story.So finally it's a horror/sacry movie disguised by a title of a fairy tale.",Gretel & Hansel

385,siulalexanderpereztrejo,"Bad, really bad",2,29 September 2020,"Terrible, Obviously it is another one of THOSE MOVIES, those 2016 ghostbusters type, yep, you can tell that they put Gretel as the protagonist by force, in the original story as much as Disney's as in the book, the brothers are pairs, none is more heroic , strong or intelligent than the other, here gretel is older, stronger and braver, and of course the brother is a fool, I see no need for the name change, the movie is slow and boring, it is better to see paint drying, all in the cinema yawned if they were lucky not to fall asleep.At the end is a bad movie..... not good,

And how can she have so many complex vocabulary like ""system"" when she doesn't read?? And the fact she's the only one speaking in American accent when everyone else is speaking British?? and that it uses Techno as its background sound?!!It was like I was watching Beverly from IT teleported to the Game of Thrones world and she has to mingle there if she wants her ""coming-of-age"" movie look cool and cinematic.and to think that it was released as new as 2020? ffs please don't push your political agenda to old classic movies.",Gretel & Hansel

For me, it added depth and complexity by using the original story as a framework to build the plot.As others mentioned, the acting and cinematography are superb. It is also more akin to ""The Witch"".It's not a fast-paced film but I believe that was done so that we (the audience) could build upon each story piece we are given. I did not watch the movie passively and made sure to pay attention to the details. So I never felt lost or confused while watching the film.What I appreciate the most, is that we are given enough information to leave with our own interpretation of what happens.If you enjoy films that provoke conversation and thought, definitely give it a go.I gave this a 10/10 and would expect at least a 7/10 from most horror movie fans.",Gretel & Hansel
389,vbrekkidd80,"Witches, hats, and that's about that",5,1 February 2020,"This is my first review in a very long time so I figured let's get real with this movie: It's slow. The cinematography is good, the blooming feel of darkness yup they got it, drugged up kids on shrooms sure why not.Let's tackle a few points..1. The Title: It brings the feminist approach by bringing Gretl to the forefront. She really was the protagonist bc she carried the weight of the journey. She knew she was hiding those witch vibes until she became into her own at the end. Let me tell you how annoyed the box office cashier was when ppl kept saying Hansel + Gretl and was correcting guests.2. The Zombie: Pointless World War Z character, and how did the hunter not know it was in the house. The zombie should've been a hallucination in the woods or a corpse of the dead kids.3. The Wolves: You could see them painted on the walls in the house, but never were they used shown.4. The Shoe Tree Patch: So Hansel just randomly trots off into a tree grove of shoes dangling in the trees. No explanation just there ... we stare at them and he stares at us ... ohhhkay.5. The Door/Chamber + Shed: How in all good places she knew to look there and rip up the wall and magically it lead to the chamber. Yet they kept focusing on what was in the shed and finally in a quick flash scene you see inside and that's it. Really that's it.6. The Axe: Hansel was purely fascinated by it and he randomly walks in a house and grabs one?! Just very pointless. His character was very underdeveloped except being used to whine about being hungry all the time. Go to McDonald's.7. The River: So now she's a woman and sees dolls sitting all over? Was that donde death of her childhood ways? Just odd.8. The cookbook + cat: I wanted more bc the drawings looked cool in them and wanted to know what were the rituals. That cat was weird and you need weird in this movie. It would've been cool of it was a trapped soul of a lived one and that's why witches have cats.The movie needed more horror and a better explanation of how the witch used turned into a puddle and was magically young. It was shown but if you never knew the folklore it would've been confusing. As much narration as Gretl did she could've responded or guided us through.I wanted more witches and the my pretty line as in Wizard of Oz, the broom, and blackened fingers could've been upplayed a bit more. Oh and the oven turning into a hibachi hotplate instead of a cauldron in a open door ... I wanted to see that.So just rent this or wait for it to come out on streaming. You'll be fine without going to the theater.",Gretel & Hansel
390,jonathan-scribner,Expected more,5,5 February 2020,"I was unfortunately left disappointed with this movie. I expected more from the trailers. Sophia did a good job with her acting, but the storyline and execution was lackluster. :/",Gretel & Hansel
391,Rodelliot,Saw It for Free and I Still Want My Money Back!,1,31 January 2020,"A truly terrible movie. A disjointed story line born from a lackluster plot, this movie disappoints on every front. The character development is bad and young Hansel delivers his lines like a 3rd grader reading the ingredients on the back of a cereal box, only less believable but more monotone. The movie trudged along to the point of fatigue. Never has an our and a half felt so long!There's an overarching feminist slant to the movie that even my middle school age daughter saw through and, like every dreadful movie, the ending was the rotten cherry on top of the spoiled whipped cream.If you pay to see this ordure I promise you you'll regret it!",Gretel & Hansel

393,whatathymeitwas,Truly great movie,8,18 September 2021,"This one caught my eye when I first saw it on Prime, and it's been sitting in my watch list ever since. I rather avoided it because reviews were mixed. Despite that, it won 4 awards and had 13 nominations. Looks like I'm familiar with director Oz Perkins. He both wrote and directed I Am The Pretty Thing That Lives In The House, as well as The Blackcoat's Daughter (both of which I liked quite a lot). Not familiar with writer Rob Hayes, seems this is his first major screenplay. There's a number of ""More Like This"" films in the suggestions that I liked a lot, so that's a good sign.Oz Perkins has said in an interview that the title was changed because this version focuses on Gretel.""It's awfully faithful to the original story. It's got really only three principal characters: Hansel, Gretel, and the Witch. We tried to find a way to make it more of a coming of age story. I wanted Gretel to be somewhat older than Hansel, so it didn't feel like two 12 year olds- rather a 16 year old and an 8 year old. There was more of a feeling like Gretel having to take Hansel around everywhere she goes, and how that can impede one's own evolution, how our attachments and the things that we love can sometimes get in the way of our growth.""So, we've morphed it into a spooky coming of age tell, I'm here for that. There are some feminist aspects and an ever present rejection against patriarchal society, they're mostly undertones throughout the film and don't detract, they add to the story in my opinion.I won't talk much about the plot proper, only in bits and pieces, as I don't like to rehash something easily found. I also won't rehash what's already in the trivia section. We're rather outside of time and place in this tale, as it should be, so it feels like a proper fairytale.Let me just pause right here for a second and point out that everything besides the stunning prologue (which is anamorphic widescreen), is filmed in a 1.55:1 aspect ratio. It's making everything look like it's actually within a storybook. That caught my eye real quick cause it's a weird choice of aspect ratio, so I had to pause and go look this up. Apparently Oz spoke to Polygon about this:
""We started thinking of the film as having a prologue and the body of the movie, and we talked about what would be expected for the first section. Probably square formatting, not quite sepia, but some kind of Instagram discoloration that looks like it came from your phone. We wanted to avoid all this. We don't want to do something that anyone could do on an app. So we shot in widescreen, almost looking like the extreme wide shots you'd see in Westerns, and made the rest of the film - the ""present"" - squarer in its aspect ratio... Basically, you marry yourself to someone who you hope has a taste compatible with yours, and I got really lucky with Galo. The fact that we literally speak different languages allowed us to find a new grammar rooted in the visual. What he was thinking and what I was thinking were often the same thing, but sometimes it was a surprise to both of us what the other person meant."" A Mountain Xpress review says, ""Perkins makes the most of his claustrophobic 1.55:1 aspect ratio and fills the frame with disconcerting close-ups and gorgeous wide shots of malevolent silhouettes in a woods awash in a red, Argento-esque hue.""I must say, the SHOTS are amazing. Framing is just *chef's kiss* with stunning symmetry. We've got some gorgeous coloring in this, very lush and ripe but also dark and dreary in a rich way, with great saturation and color. It just screams autumn in some parts. Great costuming throughout, especially in the prologue. I'm seeing a good mix of diversity in casting, and that's refreshing.We've got a segment, about a quarter in, of eating the wrong mushrooms in the woods. They resemble Fly Agaric. That leads to the start of some spooky visuals and begins paving the way for dream sequences later (which usually I don't like but I thought they were done well here without being overdone or trying to show us too much).We have a bit of the Grimm's ""The Juniper Tree"" creeping into this one and melding together a bit with the whole, ""My mother, she killed me, my father, he ate me, and my little sister, my bones she kept, what a pretty bird am I!"" Highly recommend reading it if you haven't, it may be the creepiest story they ever wrote. There also seem to be some borrowed themes here that lend themselves nicely.I love how the witch is portrayed, and the blackening of her fingers. I might add that the food in this looks great, which is something I notice a lot, and there's also a kitty! I really can't get over the symmetry of so many of these shots, and how absolutely striking it looks. I know I already said that, but man. I really want to live in this witchy cottage so bad. Though we are not told, the witch's name is Holda.While in the cottage, Gretel begins having strange dreams, visions of children and an enchantress, and at this time, it seems, begins her menstrual cycle here in the witches house. Holda begins to show Gretel how to tap into her powers as a witch. We have some very traditional things embroiled in occult/witchcraft, such as the salve and the staff. There's also a mix of magickal symbols that many find ""mushed together,"" but as an eclectic practitioner myself I thought they were just fine.Further reflections:
A lot of this is going to come off pretentious of me, but... I see so many negative reviews for this- people saying they didn't understand the plot, that there was no plot, or the plot just lost people. Some people are upset that it's ""artsy"" and therefore apparently not a ""real"" film, which is both frustrating and hilarious to me. Seems to be a fair amount of people also upset that this didn't follow the story of Hansel and Gretel to a T. Apparently many people found it just boring. I feel like probably the people who hated this, are also people who couldn't get into the director's other offerings, especially I Am The Pretty Thing That Lives In The House. I wonder if people perhaps have just become jaded by what mainstream/Hollywood has decided are good movies/box office breakers, whereas I tend to balk at films of that nature, and would much rather see something like this.I was engaged and riveted from the very beginning, and stayed that way to the end. I feel this movie makes you think, to put together some of the plot devices, which is something a lot of films I enjoy do, and something many others seem to dislike incredibly, when everything is not laid out on a silver platter and over-explained for them. I think some folks missed connecting things in the film that they should have made links between. I've seen many reviews insisting the prologue had nothing to do with the rest of the movie, but that's not the case at all, it was entwined throughout the story, with some very particular points and connections, and was spoken about later on in the movie quite pointedly and extensively.Every shot in this is an absolute piece of art, the soundscape is stunning. I appreciated the plot wholeheartedly for what it is and enjoyed the twists and turns it offered. I thought it was incredibly well written, obviously very well filmed. A refreshing and unique take on a story we've had around since the 1300's. This is a VERY atmospheric slow burn, and while it's not going to be for everyone, I find it truly wonderful. There's definitely more emphasis on the dark fantasy side than the explicit horror side, although I personally feel this is completely still a horror film. The screenplay itself is rather sparse, but I feel here that's taken advantage of by showing rather than telling. For a PG-13 film especially, I think this hits all the marks it should have.",Gretel & Hansel

Perhaps most people expect everything served to them on a platter without having to go to the table and selecting what they want. I just rode with it as if I was on one of those Amusement Park rides and just because it didn't turn into a rollercoaster and take my breath away I was still delighted. Enjoy the art, the tension, the innocence, the colours and how it slowly builds into a controlled horror with a twist.",Gretel & Hansel
400,ClintonomoBay,Interesting until our protagonists reach the cabin.,5,1 February 2020,"I was hesitant on seeing this as this director's movie ""I Am The Pretty Thing That Lives In The House"" bored me to tears and is honestly one of the worst movie i've ever seen.That being said, this movie is definitely better than that one, but still comes to a halt after an interesting set up. On one hand I really liked most of the set designs, Alice Krige was a creepy witch, cinematography was good, I admire the spin they put on the story and our characters.I didn't mind the inner monologuing as it does give the story somewhat of a fairy tale feel that complements the rest of the movie's aesthetic.However, this movie dragged in the second and even third act to the point where the audience's patience will be tested. A couple people around me were falling asleep in their seats and I would've too had I not downed caffeine prior to the showing. People like to toss around the ""slow burn horror"" phrase a lot and I like those movies too if and only if it actually pays off well in the end and, you know, actually heats up...There wasn't anything scary in this one and it feels like it had room to throw in all these little details that, when combined, could've been actually disturbing rather than just feeling like ""yeah this place seems off, wanna leave soon or..."". Furthermore, what kind of accents were these characters going for? Hansel's felt alright as some words you'd hear a clear accent but then you have Gretel not really having the same one and talking as if she was raised somewhere else than where our story takes place. It becomes very distracting and took me out of the movie at points.Overall, this could've been something better and it's disappointing to see such a good-looking movie drag its feet until the ending scenes. It does have some highlights, but some of those are shown in the trailer and the others aren't worth the ticket price. Wait for streaming to see this one if you still want to see it.",Gretel & Hansel

The frayed edges of the unknown that still exist are beautiful and absolutely carried the movie. It was a fun twist on a common story.Were I to level one complaint against this movie, it's that it finishes with voice-over, which is so far removed from the general tone of 90% of the movie that it was absolutely jarring. The last 30 seconds felt like the set-up for an Avengers style crossover.That being said, I'd absolutely love to see the same team tackle some of the other stories in the same vein. I wouldn't even hate to see them share the occasional character via archetype (Hansel as the woodsman in Little Red Riding Hood). I just want to see these stories told with a consistent tonal thread and care to visuals that we saw here.I liked it. Perfect? no. Good? absolutely.

430,pastorisaiah,Beautifully shot garbage.,3,2 February 2020,"This movie LOOKS great. Seriously, great camera work, great production design, just a beautiful movie. It's a crying shame the story was so poorly written and the film so poorly directed and edited that the craftsmanship of the cinematography is lost. This is an ambitious story that, sadly, the director and writer weren't able to execute. There are a lot of ideas that aren't fleshed out, a lot of symbolism that is robbed of deeper meaning, and overall there is a story that doesn't get told. Which is a shame, because I feel like the story they WANTED to tell would have been very intriguing, but sadly they didn't know how to tell it. Maybe they can revisit this in a decade or two when they've learned their craft a bit more. I'd pay to see that.",Gretel & Hansel

The only reason I gave this movie 2* is because I have no trust in humanity and believe some worse movies are gonna be put out there than this monstrosity.Now, you ask me, What is wrong with this movie?
Oh buddy you are in for a ride.
Where do I even start...
Let's start by the fact that the feeling that this is a disney movie is nowhere to be felt during this entire movie. During this movie you have the feeling you are watching a movie some high school kids putt together on a project. There is nothing that grabs on to you in this movie.The acting was terrible and the writing was really stretched, it was like they took all the things that happened in the original story and cramped it into 5 minutes of horrible storytelling.This movie is also supposed to be a horror movie. The only thing scary about this movie is that you have to sit through 87 minutes of garbage. The part with the witch was supposed to be scary but instead they made it really predictable. I guess for a kid it could be pretty scary but this movie is PG-13...The only thing that was okay in this movie was the scene with the shrooms. There I had quite a laugh. But it was mostly laughing at the movie than laughing because of the movie.All and all, if you have decided to put your standards to a record low than this movie is surely for you.Don't watch it.",Gretel & Hansel

448,macronerdart,An amateurish attempt at being unique,6,11 May 2020,"The first thing I noticed about this movie was it's awkward pacing. The beginning is extremely rushed and there isn't much of context. You have no clue who these characters are and the dynamics between them are perplexing at best. There is zero explanation and the film expect 10 minutes of shown exposition to cover the other hour of the movie. This was clearly done to rush into the main story, which I do admit feels more properly paced, but it is still off putting to begin with.The next thing I noticed was that the cinematography was done in a way to create anxiety and tension. Similar to how Mr. Robot goes against standard framing, this film attempted the same. However, the camerawork felt much less intentional and comes off as amateur. It leaves a lot to be desired in many scenes. However, occasionally they hit the nail right on the head and some shots are absolutely beautiful and it's clear you can see the common visual motifs across the film. Overall, I think a wide angle lense would've benefited this film crew a lot.Another point of contention of mine is the constant red herrings. Characters are introduced and then discarded, their role being but a minuscule part to advance the plot. Events that could stage something drastic or interesting come about, and yet nothing is done with them. There was so much opportunity to pose questions that would completely change the way the film is viewed, that would add layers of depth to the story that would make this an artistic beauty, and yet nothing of the sorts comes to fruition. It's a linear storyline that is predictable.This isn't to say it isn't interesting, but it is at times difficult to follow. So much unnecessary detail is given while the necessary information to enjoy this work is missing. I enjoyed the story and thought it was fun, and it leaves some questions to be pondered for the viewer, however unlike the possibilities before this isn't as multifaceted as I believe the director hoped. It has interesting motifs and poses interesting detail, but no where near enough to lift the rest of the film.If you have the time I'd recommend this as an interesting watch, like I said certain shots are perfectly executed and it was a cool concept, just poor execution.",Gretel & Hansel

454,victoriatheshy,Enjoy it for what it is and not what it isn't.,9,4 July 2020,"I've been reading a number of reviews that have absolutely panned this film. I don't think that this is necessarily fair. I don't think many are appreciating the film for what it actually is - the story of two neglected children cast out of their home and wandering through the wilderness, that is the world, largely unprotected and seeking shelter and protection from unfamiliar strangers.I read one review where the author couldn't understand why there was a zombie in the film. It's not a zombie, it's a vampire - a hat tip to olde world folklore. Hansel and Gretel was originally a German/Eastern European folktale about two children left in the woods for dead because their parents couldn't afford to feed them - it wasn't uncommon back then because survival was hard and if you're struggling to scratch out a living on the land you have, how can you possibly expect to feed your kids? Social services wasn't around back then and there weren't any food banks. The world back then wasn't as PC and considerate of feelings as it is now and they pretty much cut to the heart of most matters.The film points out, in a clumsy manner, that there are scary things in plan sight in the ordinary world, never mind the witches and vampires in the supernatural world, such as neglectful and murderous parental figures who wish to rid themselves of their own children, lecherous old men willing to take advantage of naive young girls/children (and the mother is absolutely fine with this as long as she's taken care of!), and homelessness combined with starvation.The only kindness they experience after being turned out of their family home comes from one man who didn't have any motives at all towards the children, but at the same time, he didn't want the responsibility of raising them - he feeds them, gives them a bath and provides a safe place to sleep. Perhaps this indicates that it's rare to find genuine kindness in the world and that there will be times when kindness appears and it doesn't come at a price. After all, most relationships and human interactions come at a cost.It would seem to me that Gretel is much more comfortable in the supernatural world than she is in the real world and, I think, that's what eventually separates Hansel and Gretel. Hansel's path has been set for him, because he returns home to find that his mother (and her influence) has disappeared and he (potentially) becomes a woodsman because all that there is to greet him is an axe. This is the only possession he has other than relics of a life that was more stable and prosperous, but has now become a distant and forgotten memory.As for Gretel, she's drawn to the supernatural as she can hear things, see things, and control things that ordinary people can not. She figuratively dies a death as she remains behind and becomes the witch of the woods. Perhaps this is a symbolic suicide because she's not able to go back and experience life. She carries the burden of Hansel and Gretel's plight and seems to keep it to herself while always putting best face on the world, so that Hansel feels secure. She always gives the best to Hansel.Perhaps this is why she sends him away at the end of the film. She will never fulfill her potential while she self sacrifices. She has been the mother replacement to ensure Hansel's survival. It's alluded to, in some aspects, that Hansel has an over reliance on Gretel and sucks the life out of her (like the vampire in an earlier part of the film).I think the writer wanted to convey more meaning here, but, sort of, lost the thread of the story. What is interesting about this is that Gretel is coming into her own by understanding herself and the power that she is developing. Maybe there is a touch of feminism here?Gretel's actively controlling her perception of the world and, literally, influencing the world. This has a massive impact on Hansel's life because he constantly turns to her for reassurance and stability. I only say this because in olde world folklore, woman, traditionally, have always been portrayed as playing a supporting role in men's lives when the fact of the matter is...women control all of it. Hansel only knows how to destroy with his ax whereas Gretel is learning to create. Nevertheless, there is no survival for boy children without the nurturing kindness of women. Maybe this is why Gretel's name appears before Hansel's in the title of the film?",Gretel & Hansel

Lesser known, young director Oz Perkins starred in movies like in Psycho II and Wolf as an actor, his first movies are The Blackcoat's Daughter (2015) and I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House ( 2016).
The whole movie is carefully lit and designed minimalistic but beautiful. The more modern looks and setup goes well together with the ( originally ) 19th century tales from Grimm's Brother. Completly void of unnecessary story strands it yet features some strong magic moments that dip into the more occult and not so obvious sexual things of the original tales. recommended.",Gretel & Hansel

Art is subjective, but something can be pretty and still be bad.The visuals are moody and beautiful, very disorienting. I thought the costuming was VERY good.That being said, I won't be revisiting this movie. Ever. Alice Krige gave the best performance in the movie by far and I was pretty disappointed by the others'. The inconsistent accents completely remove you from the story. Some of the writing feels so unnatural it made me cringe.The plot generally was okay, but I'm not sure if I needed MORE or LESS information to fully understand what they were intending.

It's not a horror film that relies on jump scares like so many others have been doing lately. It relies on the story and beautiful cinematography, and is successful in creeping you the hell out. It's got issues, but it's still worth watching for everything it gets right. I'll admit to wishing that I still smoked, because this movie feels like it's perfect for stoners who enjoy horror.

That being said, on a whim, I went to see this ""horror"" movie and had very low expectations. What a surprise! The movie is more of a fantasy movie and has an intense hypnotic vibe that makes it very unique. Absent of the typical vacant teenagers making dumb and deservedly deadly choices, the characters are fabulous all around. The music and cinematography is first rate. It has a ""trippy"" feel about and it's weaving tale is subtle enough that you might miss out on how the character of Gretel winds up who she is. It's an ultimate tale of good and evil and good wins in the end. Sam Leakey, who plays Hansel did an extraordinary job as does Alice Krige (the witch) and Sophia Lillis (Gretel). It's neither shocking nor gory but truly mesmerizing. A definite 10! If spellbinding is your thing rather than blood and guts, ignore the bad reviews and go see this one.",Gretel & Hansel

477,seanesso,A modern gem,8,10 May 2020,"So, and I say this as a 30 year old, I think most people these days are incapable of watching slow films. They're so used to high speed shots and zombie action thrillers that they get bored easily with the pace. So I felt this movie was getting a bad wrap, undeservedly so.I'm personally sick of seeing horror films with absolutely no originality nor atmosphere, that lie solely on bad CGI, gore fests and jump scares. Those are abundant, so I guess people love them. I've only seen a few good horror films in the last few years - among them are The Witch, Suspiria, Tale of Tales (if it counts as horror), and this. If you like the other films I mentioned, you'll probably like this one. All of those got a hit for being ""slow"" too, but they all have killer atmosphere and interesting stories.I also saw a lot in the storyline though what I saw was deep and psychological, so therefore not spelled out. There were questions I still had at the end of the film but I always still have questions at the end of films.I thought the director's take on an old fairytale was highly refreshing. The eeriness of the atmosphere takes me back to good horror that we haven't had much of in years. I loved to use of darkness and candlelight throughout the film. The horror itself relies on imagery and the feeling of uneasiness and being alone. You could compare it to something like Blair Witch (ignore the horrible screaming and camera wobbles and think of the woods, the symbolism of witchcraft, and the feeling that the witch is always there).I'll add I'm sure the reason that it's Gretel and Hansel and not vice versa is because the story is mainly about her... it's not this political correctness hogwash I see in some comments.",Gretel & Hansel

483,hafwaytothemoon,The moral of this tale? Sociopath is a aspiring trait.,2,17 May 2020,"It's a snail pace movie from the beginning to the very end. But slow doesn't necessarily have to be bad. Its problem is that it's a boring movie. A death blow to the horror genre. And clearly the director didn't care. There was no energy spent building interesting characters, events or dialogues. Which makes one wonder if the bare bone story might have been by design. Because all the attention went to the artsy feel of the movie, and its children level social lessons. The only stand out was the performance of Alice Krige. But credit goes entirely to her.So if the story doesn't mater, what's the movie about? Like Grimm stories, it wants to be moral tale. A feminist empowerment tale. Which wants to turn woman into sociopaths. It presents any relationship with other human beings, as an obstacle for the evolution and realization of ones potential. Especially relationships with man. It wants to turn woman into narcissistic and self centred beings. Unable to love anyone but them self. Because depending or being responsible for someone else, can only be born from oppression. Not because you love or care about someone. Empathy is a chain. Humans aren't social beings, and mothers aren't connected to their children because they love them. Or sisters to their little brothers. But because they have been socially conditioned. And so the prison is born. You can then only be free and empowered, if you're in an island alone with a mirror. Free from the weight of the others can you finally grow. So its alright to abandon a 8 years old boy, alone into the world, in medieval times. But he'll be alright because you gave him a horse.",Gretel & Hansel
484,shobbezm-04625,Great photography but very boring movie,3,16 April 2020,I saw this movie i find the cinematography are great but the movie very boring movie,Gretel & Hansel
485,slcallister,Quite literally the worst movie I've ever seen,1,6 February 2020,"Most of the scenes were absolutely pointless. Tons of random moments with no context or purpose that mean nothing to the story. DO NOT SEE IT. Nothing about this movie makes sense, not even the ending. It's not even scary at all.",Gretel & Hansel
486,kbrucebruce,Waste of Time,2,4 February 2020,"Shouldn't be considered a horror movie for starters. It seemed like they just threw darts at an idea board and added whatever it landed on into the movie without making an actual plot. The acting was good and it was pretty, but that's it.",Gretel & Hansel
487,yunhaoyang,Exceptional experience,8,13 September 2020,"It's truly a visual stunning, well-crafted project with high quality cinematography and acting. The overall style is absolutely exceptional and also, slightly strange, consider the genre of the film. But I am thrilled so see a film with such a unique execution.",Gretel & Hansel
488,billyg-76629,Aweful,1,12 February 2020,This is by far the worst movie I have seen in many years. I don't know the ending because we walked out with under an hour to go. I am ashamed of myself for lasting that long. I love movies but this dud takes the cake. Don't tell me if Gretel turns out to be a boy. She certainly looked like one. It should be called Hansel and Hansel and the wicked witch of the west or east or wherever the hell she came from. Buy lottery tickets or cigarettes. The cigarettes will kill you just like this movie.,Gretel & Hansel
489,jcornelioguzman,So boring.,2,3 May 2020,I almost fell asleep. Didn't expect it to be this way.,Gretel & Hansel
490,siaaajohny,A wonderfully done film with a 'spellbinding' tale to tell,8,9 April 2020,"I am thoroughly disappointed. Not at the film, but at the reviews that I went through. The film begins with a grappling narrative that instantly hooks me. It greatly conveys the story of Hansel & Gretel while adding an element of twist to the original fairy tale, hence what we got: Gretel & Hansel. It makes the main theme intended by the story instantly which is the caution of accepting gifts from strangers as a reflection of giving in to gluttony, at least in this case. The atmosphere and the music are very grim (pun intended) and absolutely befitting, not to mention the gorgeous directing. It does not have any unnecessary action or jump scares to it which is usually what is expected by the viewers, thus I believe the reason why most belittle this film. However, it leaves us with a powerful message: The art of accepting oneself is not an easy one, and whether we give in to the darkness inside of us is only a matter of choice. Of course, if you personally are not into psychological horror and the Gothic atmosphere does not suit your fancy, then simply look away.",Gretel & Hansel
491,prashangoneea,Potential,7,15 May 2020,"The premise building as the movie proceeds is somewhat promising. The movie may be a prequel to another one to follow in the near future, and while it could have contained more captivating scenes, I get the impression all that hype may follow in the next one. The downside is that it's a potential cliffhanger movie and if it actually is, then it's too much of one. The powers of Gretel still evolving, the relationship between her and Hansel left hanging, and the dystopian world they are portrayed in elaborated scarcely builds uncharted intrigue. Yet, seeing the layout and scenery coupled with dark storyline, I can't help but have a preference for whatever it could follow to be and being part of the classic good movies club. All said, could've done better but did not suck in profuse hindsight! 7/10.",Gretel & Hansel
492,robincharbonnel,Absolutely beautiful and that's it.,5,4 November 2020,"Gretel and Hansel is visually extremely impressive, but tries way too hard to be as mysterious as The Witch or Hereditary, and forgets to be its own movie. The characters only have a start of a story but their potential can only be seen for the 5 minutes of their introduction and then the writing gets lazy and doesn't develop them anymore. The movie doesn't really talk about anything, the story is extremely simple and even with it being so simple it is still missing answers. There is a difference between being truly mysterious, making you ask yourself questions, and faking those feelings by just showing closed doors and hatches for no reason.",Gretel & Hansel
493,barceloclown,Wait for it to come out on Netflix,5,1 February 2020,"A film with good photography but that does not fully exploit the potential of the original story. It begins as a movie with a terrifying atmosphere that progressively fades to become a boring tape. The ""horror"" moments are caused by sudden loud sounds. Elements of the script are not explained as they should. Definitely a movie that does not deserve to be seen in the cinema, save it to show it to your young son at home.",Gretel & Hansel
494,joshdperry,Waste of time,1,10 May 2020,"This abysmal waste of time was an example of some of the worst acting i have ever been subjected to. Melodramatic and completely lacking in emotion, the dialogue sounded like it was written by brooding teenagers having just discovered their first thesaurus. Often making anachronistic and unusual vocabulary choices that are regularly just downright distracting, the main character frequently drifts off on tiresome monologues that remind me again of amateur theater club scripts ostentatiously trying to sound deep and profound. The only effort expressed on screen seems to be in the delivery of this movie's only theatrical device: the jump scare. If you enjoy going from deafening silence to a sudden cacophony of dissonant strings and horror sound effect library bites, you will not be disappointed.",Gretel & Hansel
495,roburning,Left a positive note!,1,3 February 2020,"Despite seeing the reviews first and noticing so many negative comments, I went ahead and gave the movie the benefit of the doubt. Im not sure about the others but I feel that this movie definitely gave something positive. Even though I missed 3/4 of the movie, the movie finally helped cure my sleeping disorder, which is the best thing that ever happened about this movie which other movies couldn't deliver! I immediately fell asleep 15 minutes in and I woke up hearing my friends complaining about this absolute garbage can of a movie. Was suppose to give 1 star but gave another cause it helped me sleep. Special thanks to the credits for letting me know the name of director so I can watch his movies again whenever I cant sleep.",Gretel & Hansel
496,BrandgevaarNL,Terrible,2,3 January 2021,Terrible movie. Just throw 90 minutes of my life away,Gretel & Hansel
497,jairuslance,Wow...simply wow,1,28 May 2020,"Nothing to see here but film of wasted energy. Nothing made sense in a plot term. Random things and jump scares seem to be the highlight of the movie. The witches don't make sense, and blah. I felt bad renting this for 3.99. Random puke scene that sounds like babies crying. Come on....",Gretel & Hansel
498,nait_hyghr,Inconsistencies mar the entire movie watching experience,7,29 April 2020,"This movie could have been great, but it is not. The first incredibly jarring, world-breaking inconsistency is that all leading actors speak with different accents. And then there are a number of minor inconsistencies with the plot, which I have been able to overlook, but the fact that the main actors have different accents has proven too brothersome to ignore. It, basically, spoilt the whole movie for me and my friends with whom I watched it.",Gretel & Hansel
499,jorgejunior-90599,This could have been on Netflix,4,7 February 2020,I was extremely excited to see this movie just to find out it was PG13. It could have ended more better. It felt like an incomplete movie. Is there going to be a part two? Why wasn't rated R? I was expecting to jump out my seat. I was devastated,Gretel & Hansel
500,macacre,This director just doesn't know what he wants,3,2 May 2020,"Although the trailer looks decent, this film is so bad. It just appropriates a bunch of aesthetic and narrative film trends from the last couple of years, and then doesn't know which way to go with them.
Visually it is very well done, just takes that low saturation, monochromatic palette, period aesthetics of films like The Witch, and just like that film, it seems bound to explore that same perspective of the Divine Feminine or Pagan Feminism, so brilliantly portrayed as well in Mother! and Midsommar. However it barely scratches the surface of the theme and then out of nowhere just explodes into a bunch of Harry Potter style fantasy outbursts and Hot Topic goth clichés.
Yeah, I get that it is a fairy tale and that there is supposed to be magic and fantasy, but even films like The Company of Wolves, with its gruesome old-school special effects, seems to blend fantasy and reality so seamlessly, thanks to the depth of the story and the development of its characters.
For centuries, fairy tales have had such an important role across cultures, and this movie just fails miserably in contributing something new to the genre.",Gretel & Hansel
501,marcoscarciafratte,One of the most awful film I ve ever seen in my life,3,21 August 2020,"Don't waste time and money for this film.
Boring and awful",Gretel & Hansel

503,stephanieaharris-48913,Good take on a well known folktale.,6,22 April 2020,"Gorgeous visual adaptation of the folktale Hansel and Gretel, not as dark as the trailer made it seem like it was going to be. Definitely worth renting from Redbox!",Gretel & Hansel
504,mrheintz-47988,Great spin on a classic,8,11 July 2021,This to me seemed very well done. Good story and the cast did a fantastic acting job. It has that dark feel of many fairy tails.,Gretel & Hansel
505,patrickediaz-06405,"Ignore the trolls, watch this film.",8,15 February 2020,"Gretel and Hansel has some of the best cinematography I've seen on a film this small.
All of the stylistic choices are motivated. Internet trolls are quick to disregard this film because of its name without giving it a fair shake. It's easy to look at reviews and take them without a grain of salt, however you'd do yourself a disservice by skipping this.
In an age of AMC stubs, and regal unlimited, it takes nothing to give a less than 90 minute movie a shot. It delivers, with atmosphere so rich you could spread it on toast. Every frame of this movie is like a painting. Its mainly motivated by subtext and is a thinker at times, but if you don't go in expecting an action filled pseudo-horror mess, you'll enjoy yourself just fine. Go watch, it. its a cool movie, damn it.",Gretel & Hansel
506,moondog-15706,A film that Could have been a gem,4,4 February 2020,"The film starts promising. The Character played by Alice Krige, is convincing and has depth. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the sister and brother, who's acting is two dimensional, characters are flat, and expressions bland. The end unfortunately was painfully predictable. If the ending had taken a 180% turn in the opposite direction, it would, have made more sense . As it was, the ending lacked courage.",Gretel & Hansel
507,davsalazar-84922,Good Fairy Tale,7,5 February 2020,"It's definitely not a horror movie, but it's a well-made fairy tale, the atmosphere and the aspect ratio is what caught my attention, and synthesizer music is something I didn't expect. Maybe my expectation was not very great, they could improve the end but meh! it's okay.",Gretel & Hansel
508,larrieuxmichelle,Boring movie,1,1 February 2020,"If I could put zero out of ten. I would. I does not deserve a review. Boring movie, totally different from the original story. Do not waste your money in this disaster of a movie.",Gretel & Hansel
509,rderenzis,Incredible innovative take on a terrifying classic,9,2 May 2020,"The story, the music and the cinematography... all come together gorgeously in this new take on the classic fairytale.

514,rbrister-00697,Nice Nap,5,3 February 2020,"To be fair it was a long work week but still, I rarely sleep through movies, especially at the theater!
The overall pace was too slow. The minimal cast was competent but underwhelming. The story, at least in this case, doesn't require an hour and a half to tell.",Gretel & Hansel
515,lilicsongor,Dont believe in negative reviews!,10,14 April 2020,"True, that this is not the original bloody/ghost horror movie type, that the majority of viewers are waiting for. INSTEAD it is a freshly, artistic way of remaking the classic Hansel und Gretel. A beautiful yet horrifying story about magic, abandoneness, despair and finding ourselves. Anyone with a bit of artistic vein would deifintely enjoy this",Gretel & Hansel
516,guff-29805,Waste of my time and money,1,31 January 2020,"I can't believe I actually paid to see this nothing movie. No action, horror or real story. I kept waiting for something to happen but it never did. People were asleep in the theater and I was debating if.",Gretel & Hansel
