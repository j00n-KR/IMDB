0,Leofwine_draca,"A refreshing entry in the franchise, much underrated",7,3 November 2016,"Here's something surprising: I liked ROCKY V. I actually enjoyed it far more than the last sequel, that was nothing more than a retread of ROCKY III, substituting Dolph Lundgren for Mr T and achieving little else in the short running time. ROCKY V boasts a cracking story from Stallone that takes the saga in new directions, carefully avoiding the clichés and as a result breathing fresh life into what was becoming a tired series. To that end, director John G. Avildsen returns to the franchise for the first time since the original, and the film feels very close to that one in nature: there's a return to the gritty, on-the-street vibe that was missing before, and it's good to have it back.Rocky's character has progressed since the last film. He's now a near-disabled man, disturbed by brain damage and past his prime. His relationship with his son (played by Stallone's real-life boy Sage) takes up much of the film, and it's an interesting one that's played to the hilt. Talia Shire and Burt Young don't have much to do again, but kudos for the return of Burgess Meredith for some genuinely moving and poignant flashbacks that brought a tear to this viewer's eye.Some have cast doubt on the acting ability of newcomer boxer Tommy Morrison, but I found his acting suited the role perfectly: he's supposed to be a meathead, a jock, not some thespian. I enjoyed watching the storyline play out, the inevitable twist, and then I found the closing street fight simply refreshing: Stallone did well not to have his character return to the ring for yet another match. This way feels a lot better, a lot more real. Plus, it has one of my favourite Stallone moments, his classic ""You knocked him down...now why don't you try knocking me down?"" moment.",Rocky V
1,SnoopyStyle,Resurrecting the dead,3,4 July 2014,"Rocky Balboa is back from Russia after defeating Drago. Sleazy promoter George Washington Duke wants Rocky to fight his fighter Union Cane. However Rock is suffering from brain damage and retires. Then they find out that their crooked accountant had lost all their money. Rocky only has Mickey's old gym and he moves back to the old neighborhood. Rocky Balboa Jr. (Sage Stallone) is having trouble with the mean kids. Neighborhood kid Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) begs Rocky to be his manager. Tommy has some success and that's when Duke swoops in.Stallone is trying to bring back every last bit of goodness from the original. It's part homage and part resurrecting the dead. They have Rocky flashback to Burgess Meredith. They even brought back John G. Avildsen to direct. They engineer Rocky to move back to the old neighborhood in a convoluted manufactured story. There's a younger version of Rocky. They got Sly's son to play Rocky's son.On paper, this is daring attempt to bring back the glory of the first movie. It's as if everybody had a checklist of things to do. This is not inspired as much as it's constructed. The one thing that this does not have from the original is a sense of reality. The first one had a documentary style feel. A lower class Italian neighborhood is realistic back then. I can't help but notice that the run down place is still filled with mostly white people. There is one attempt at an old hangout that turned into something foreign. It just feels like very fake. It struggles to split the difference between the gritty documentary feel of the original and the glossy formulaic sequels. It needed to choose. It does not and fails to be either.",Rocky V
2,classicsoncall,"""It don't hurt having an angel in your corner, you know.""",7,1 September 2012,"Personally, extending the Rocky franchise beyond the first three movies was probably asking for trouble, but that could just be me. ""Rocky IV"" struck me as a quick way to make a buck with a series of cobbled together scenes from the first three films with a resounding sound track pumping up the volume. This one has a bit more of a plot to it, with the strained relationship between Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) and his son (real life son Sage Stallone) at the center of the story. It works up to a point, but by the time it develops into an alley fight between The Rock and his protégé Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison), all semblance of believability just melts away in a flash of fists and fury.For starters, you have to consider the length of time it would have taken Tommy to begin training with Rocky, develop into a preliminary fighter, and then compile a record of 22 and 0 to earn a championship match. Even if he fought every two months, it still would have taken a couple of years to get to the Union Cane fight. The way this story blazes by, it seems like it all takes place in a matter of days and Tommy suddenly finds himself at the top of the boxing world. And THEN, all of a sudden, Union Cane is outed as a fraud? That just made my head spin. No one becomes the World Champ by beating pushovers, what alternate universe would this have taken place in? You know, the Rocky films played a nasty trick on me when they had his manager Mickey (Burgess Meredith) die in ""Rocky II"". For the longest time I couldn't figure out if Meredith was dead or alive when he showed up in the sequels. I know, it's easy enough to look up, but it's one of those things that keep you guessing. To save you the trouble, Meredith was alive when he made his daydream appearances in this film. For my money, the best sequence in the picture was the one where Rocky had the imaginary conversation with his former manager. That was very well done.As I write this review, I'm stunned by the news that Sage Stallone passed away just a month ago. I never heard about it at the time, and as I read the links from the IMDb website, I'm reminded that life isn't like the movies where happy endings have a tendency to prevail. My condolences go out to Stallone and his family, and I hope the Rocky spirit gets him through this ordeal.",Rocky V
3,jboothmillard,Rocky V,3,3 April 2011,"Until the return in 2006 most people probably thought this fifth instalment in the series would be the last one, and if it was going to be, it would have been a terrible way to go, from first film Razzie nominated director John G. Avildsen (The Karate Kid), the star directed the other three. Basically Rocky Balboa (Razzie nominated Sylvester Stallone) has defeated the big shots and fearsome opponents, the now dead Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang and most recently Ivan Drago, who inflicted permanent damage during their fight. Because of this brain damage caused, Rocky is forced to retire from boxing on medical grounds, but he is glad to be spending more time at home with wife Adrian (Razzie nominated Talia Shire) and son Rocky Jr. (Sage Stallone, Sly's real life son). More trouble comes however when it is discovered that his fortune made from fighting, which he entrusted with Adrian's brother Paulie (Razzie nominated Burt Young), has been squandered by an incompetent accountant. After being forced to sell many possessions and the mansion, Rocky was tempted back into the ring by promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant) who wanted to see him defend hi World Champion title, but Adrian stops him. But then he is approached by Tommy 'Machine' Gunn (Tommy Morrison) who idolises and wants to be trained by him, therefore Rocky becomes his trainer at the gym run by his old and now dead trainer Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith), seen through flashback. While Rocky Jr. is being bullied at school, his father is neglecting him to train and manage Tommy, he manages to get him some fights, which he wins all off, and they are both on a high. Duke comes back to the scene with a deceptive tactic to work around Rocky, he tells Tommy many things to turn him arrogant and go against his manager, until eventually he bursts out that he isn't getting him any high profile matches and moves on. With Duke as Tommy's new manager, this at least gives Rocky time to put things straight with his son, but then he sees his ex-student boxer win the golden belt, but his arrogance still gets boos from the audience. Duke tells him that the only way to gain better respect is to beat Rocky one-on-one, and this comes too life in a bar where an argument turns into a street fight, but of course Rocky wins in the end. Also starring Tony Burton as Tony Duke, Jimmy Gambina as Jimmy, Delia Sheppard as Karen and Mike Girard Sheehan as Merlin Sheets. Stallone is okay, Shire isn't on as much, Morrison is a bit over the top, Gant is alright, and Meredith appearing in a new flashback doesn't do much, the montage sequences are now just a bit silly, with new music especially, and the fact that the only matches in the film come from the new young arrogant character is ridiculous, as is the final fight not in the ring, a daft boxing drama sequel. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Picture, Worst Original Song for Sir Elton John's ""The Measure of a Man"" and Worst Screenplay. Adequate!",Rocky V
4,ccthemovieman-1,"Fans Of The Series Should Still Like This One, Too",7,15 November 2006,"I think this was the only Rocky film I never saw at the theater. I guess I'd had enough by then. However, I did catch this on VHS and, despite all the negative opinions I had read concerning it, I was glad I saw it. It was typical Rocky entertainment: hokey but satisfying and generally enjoyable.Richard Gant did a nice job impersonating Don King and Tommy Morrison, a real-life fighter, turned out to be a pretty good actor. Again, we see the familiar characters of Rocky, still sounding stupid; wife Adrian, older-looking but still faithful to her husband, and Paulie, still a slob and a low-life.The final scene provides the usual over-done fight with.....well, if you've seen the others and enjoyed them - the fights and the stories - you should like this, too.",Rocky V
5,ma-cortes,Acceptable follow-up in which Balboa is willing to risk his life against ingrate boxer,7,30 January 2012,"Interesting sequel that works every time and in which beloved Balboa , the one time champion , returns to take on an ingrate contender performed by Tommy Morrison . Officially a sequel is most a rehash but happens to be a nice fifth chapter about Rocky saga with intimate Stallone . Two-bit fighter Rocky is now retired and has hit rock bottom , he lives from records but our hero returns as coach and to face off a daring contender . Reluctantly retired from boxing and back from riches to rags , Rocky takes on a new protégé who betrays him . As the champ's son must adjust to his family's new life on bankruptcy and being ostracized . Although he is homaged as one of the greatest boxing champions in the history also is panned as a down-and-out fighter , being nicknamed as the Chicken Stallion . But ¨The Italian Stallion¨ comes out from retirement for fame and self-respect to combat strongest, youngest and faster contender , despite his own cerebral damage , through a rematch on the streets . While Rocky attempts to prove himself and his family , his wife (Talia Shire), brother-in-law (Burt Young) and his teenager son (Sage Stallone , real-life son plays Rocky Jr).This enjoyable predictable entertainment displays splendidly the 'formula Rocky'. The movie works at usual manner, fitting appropriately to franchise , even though we know the plot the film works . This soaper on the ring is developed in gentleness, dignity , feel-good style such as the initial outing . Great training montage and spectacular and climatic final bout . Writer-director-actor Stallone new entry is surprisingly entertaining and packs good feeling . Usual and nostalgic musical score by Bill Conti and atmospheric cinematography by Steven Poster . The motion picture is lavishly financed by the producers of complete saga , Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler and well directed by John G Avildsen who along Stallone created the six Rocky saga.While here the opponent is an invincible young fighter ,champ of the world, played by a real boxer named Tommy Morrison , in previous and subsequent entries the contenders were the following : ¨Rocky I and II¨ was Carl Weathers ; ¨Rocky III¨ after being dethroned by obnoxious , corpulent Mr T from A Team ; ¨Rocky IV¨ against a massive Russian boxer played by Dolph Lundgren ; and ¨Rocky Balboa¨ proving his estranged young son Milo Ventiglimia who still can fight . Rating : Good , being impossible to dislike , the result is deliciously corny agreeable and predictable amusement . Although we've seen it all before , Sylvester manages to make it work one more time and it works every way even better than subsequents Rockys",Rocky V
6,BA_Harrison,Not the greatest.,5,7 September 2019,"It's a Rocky movie, so I had some fun with it, but there is plenty that Rocky V gets wrong in my opinion.Firstly, the whole riches to rags story feels like a punch to the gut after all that has happened. His entire wealth gone because of a bad decision by Paulie (Burt Young)... is this even possible?Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison, sporting a bad mullet) is a forgettable, personality-free opponent, especially when compared to the likes of Creed and Lang. Even Drago had more charisma.The '90s rap/dance music is dreadful; what's wrong with the rock music of the previous instalments?Rocky ignoring his son in favour of Gunn goes against character. I know he sees a chance of reliving his youth through Tommy, but it doesn't feel right.I hate the way Robert (Sage Stallone) goes from being the ideal son to a street punk in a matter of days (his dangly ear-ring gets on my nerves too).The street-fight feels anticlimactic compared to all of the final boxing matches in the previous films.Lastly, there are too many turtle-necks in the film.Rocky V is still watchable thanks to Stallone and the other familiar faces (Talia Shire, Young), but it's definitely my least favourite of the series.",Rocky V
7,BandSAboutMovies,Go for it!,6,13 August 2019,"I've avoided this movie for some time, due to its bad reputation and just the general feeling that I had no interest in seeing Rocky slide back into the sad life that he escaped. This week of Stallone movies has given me the opportunity to watch this one, however, and while it's not my favorite of the films, it's not as bad as I feared.Director John G. Avildsen - who directed the original - returns to direct this one, which finds our hero go right back to the same streets that he once trained on. Avildsen clashed with cinematographer Steven Poster during the making of the film, feeling that the realism of the movie was threatened by over-lighting instead of using a single spotlight to create a mood. Poster told Avildsen that the original film ""looked like a cheap documentary,"" to which the Oscar-winning director replied, ""Exactly.""A week after Rocky defeats Ivan Drago in Rocky IV, he returns to the United States. However, he's not whole - the fight pretty much has finished him off, leaving him feeling broken inside. As he conducts a press conference, promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant), who is pretty much Don King, tries to get Rocky to fight his man Union Cane (pro boxer Mike Williams).The pain isn't over for Rocky - not by a long shot. It turns out that thanks to bad advice from Paulie (Burt Young), the boxer gave power of attorney to his accountant, who pulled a Bernie Madoff on him, leaving him with a foreclosed second mortgage and six years of unpaid taxes.It gets worse, too. Rocky has a brain injury that was further compounded by the blows he endured defeating Drago. Now, he can never fight again, so he must sell his home and all his belongings, moving back to the streets he thought he escaped.After a night of drinking, Rocky enters his old gym and sees a vision of Mickey (Burgess Meredith) appear to him, telling him a speech much like the one that Cus D'Amato told Mike Tyson after his first fight. This leads to rocky reopening the gym and eventually becoming the manager for Tommy Gunn (boxer Tommy Morrison), a young man from Oklahoma who becomes Rocky's surrogate son.But doesn't Rocky already have a son? He sure does and his kid Robert (Stallone's real life son Sage, who would one day help form Grindhouse Releasing) must adjust from private school to the tough inner city school, getting his ass kicked every step of the way. Even worse, he has a dad who only wants to get in the ring and train his fighter.Of course Tommy Gunn is going to give in to the dark side, falling under the sway of Duke. It's brutal when Rocky watches on TV and Gunn extols the angel on his shoulder that the promoter has become, langauge specifically used to try and bring the retired champion into the ring. Instead, the two brawl in a brutal street fight that ends with Rocky victorious.That fight, however, is awesome. That's probably because pro wrestling legend Terry Funk choreographed it, which explains the German suplex spot. Amazingly, the fight was originally going to end with Rocky dying in Adrian's arms. Eventually, Stallone decided to rewrite the ending, as he believes that Rocky is all about perseverance and redemption. A death in a street fight? That isn't how a hero goes out, right?Michael Williams and Tommy Morrison were scheduled to have an actual boxing match about a month after this was released, hyped as ""The Real Cane vs. Gunn Match,"" but Williams was injured and could not compete.Speaking of Morrison, he had a pretty interesting life. His nickname, ""The Duke"", comes from a claim that he was either the grand nephew or grandson of John Wayne, which may or may not have been true. He started doing tough man contests at the age of 13 before going into boxing, where he amassed a 202-20 record and won the Gold Medal at the Seoul Olympics. His pro career included wins over George Foreman for the WBO title and a 48-3-1 record.At one point, Morrison was married to two women at the same time and had two children by the age of 19. Those sons, Trey Lippe Morrison and James McKenzie Morrison, have grown up to be pro boxers themselves.His life took a sad turn in 1996 when he failed a blood test before a fight. He had HIV, which he said came from his permissive, fast and reckless lifestyle, saying ""Wilt Chamberlain had nothing on me. Infidelity was one of my biggest battles in life. I couldn't overcome it.""Morrison tested negative for HIV in 2007 and began boxing again, even though some of those fights were supposedly staged. He also dealt with probation issues from past arrests that led to him serving nearly two years in jail.In August of 2013, Morrison's mother claimed he had full blown AIDS, even if the boxer's mother didn't agree. Morrison died a month later from cardiac arrest, resulting from multiorgan failure due to septic shock caused by an infection.In the years following the film's release, Stallone acknowledged that the brain injury angle was inaccurate. Instead, it's a mild form of brain damage, such as CTE, and it wouldn't have prevented Rocky from gaining a license to box or put his life in danger.When asked to rate all of the Rocky films by British host Johnathan Ross, Stallone gave this one a zero. I kind of love that he also has stated that Tommy Gunn left boxing and become a ""third rate pro wrestler"" afterward. I'd love to see that movie.This is the only boxing movie I can think of with MC Hammer and Elton John on the soundtrack. It wasn't as bad as I feared, but wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. But man, that last fight is great.",Rocky V
8,sunwarrior13,Good Thing There Was Rocky Balboa,6,23 October 2011,"It was touted upon its release to be the final installment of the Rocky movie franchise.It reunites star Sylvester Stallone with John G. Avildsen, director of the Oscar-winning Rocky. Rocky V is the fifth film in the series.It stars Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire,Burt Young,Burgess Meredith,Tony Burton, Stallone's real life son Sage Stallone, and real life boxer Tommy Morrison as boxer Tommy Gunn, a talented yet raw boxer.The movie explores the relationship between Rocky and his son,Rocky Jr. The story has Rocky Balboa, suffering from career-ending brain damage as a result of his punishing bout with Ivan Drago at the finale of the Rocky IV,the previous film. Upon their return to Philadelphia, Rocky and his wife, Adrian,discover they are broke, their fortune squandered by an incompetent accountant. Forced to move back to their working-class neighborhood, Rocky finds that his only asset is the run-down gym willed to him by Mickey. Resisting big money offered to him by Don King-like boxing promoter George Washington Duke, Rocky becomes a trainer and finds a talented comer in Tommy Gunn. Rocky's son feels neglected by his father, who lavishes attention on his protégé, but Tommy ultimately turns his back on his mentor to sign a more lucrative deal with Duke, leading to a street-fight showdown - which was a bad way to end the franchise.A lot of Rocky fans just hated this film.Even Sylvester Stallone rated it a zero.The star practically disowns this film.Well,the film just lost the underdog theme.The fact that the Balboas return to their old Philadelphia neighborhood is the only thing new in this film.Although it tries to recapture the original Rocky spirit with this,it failed in its purpose miserably.One reason I have said is that the underdog theme which has kept the franchise afloat and is definitely missing in it.The Rocky-Tommy Gunn relationship fails as well considering that fans would rather see Rocky fighting inside the ring as an underdog rather than the development of the protégé just as he is portraying the role of Mick,his trainer.Finally,the last street-fight boxing match just looked out of place.The performances were okay in this film.Nothing worth mentioning and nothing worth criticizing either.The film just looked completely lost from the series.The flashbacks and the return to Balboa's roots were the only ones linking it to the Rocky franchise.Nothing more.Overall,just like Rocky die-hards,I think that this is the worst installment of the series behind Rocky,Rocky Balboa,Rocky II,Rocky III and Rocky IV.Good thing that Rocky Balboa or Rocky VI was made to make up for Rocky V - which I believe is the great conclusion and proper way to end the series.",Rocky V

10,Theo Robertson,Didn`t Knock Me Out,4,12 August 2004,"After a recap of the most unlikely world heavyweight boxing contest in history ( One fighter is American , one is Russian and both are white ) ROCKY V actually gets off to a good start as we`re introduced to a fast talking opportunist Don King clone called George Washington Duke , and we then find out that Rocky and his family are going to be falling on hard times . I really had high hopes for the movie at this point since a Don King type exploiting boxers who are in dire financial straits is a very realistic plot However things start going awry for a cynical viewer since we`re treated to dumb jokes :Knock knock Who`s there ? Madam Madam who ? My damn foot got caught in the door again and an excess of honey coated sentiment . We`re shown a flashback of Rocky remembering his mentor and trainer Mickey Goldmill and it`s impossible to watch this sequence without grabbing for an insulin injection . It also shows up what a wooden actor Mr Stallone is . There`s also other subplots that won`t appeal to a more cynical audience like Rocky`s son finding love amidst a tough school I will be honest and say that this sequel is far far better than ROCKY 4 which was basically an MTV video but did we really need a franchise involving a movie that deserved one sequel at most ?",Rocky V
11,utgard14,"""It's like everyday you learn something new and everyday I forget something new.""",5,7 July 2015,"Fifth Rocky movie has the Oscar-winning director of the first film, John G. Avildsen, returning to the series. There's nothing Oscar-worthy about this one, though. It's the worst Rocky movie hands down. There are things in it worth seeing for fans of the series but, ultimately, it's not very good. While he doesn't direct this time, Sylvester Stallone does once again write the screenplay. He attempts to return Rocky to his roots, no doubt hoping it would recapture the magic of the first Rocky film. He accomplishes this by having Rocky suffer brain damage from the Ivan Drago fight in Rocky IV (not unrealistic given the superhuman way Drago was portrayed in that film). Due to his injury he talks like a moron and can no longer fight professionally. To make matters worse, he loses his fortune and is now broke. So Rocky, Adrian, and Paulie return to the crummy Philadelphia neighborhood where they started out in the first film. Like I said, the hope was obviously to put the pieces back in place where they were at the start and hope for more magic. There is no magic here, unfortunately.The story has Rocky coaching an up-and-coming fighter named Tommy Gunn, played by real-life boxer (and supposed grandnephew of John Wayne) Tommy Morrison. Rocky mentors Tommy but neglects his own son (played by Stallone's son Sage). As Rocky realizes the mistakes he's made, Tommy is turned against his mentor by flamboyant boxing promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant). Inevitably this leads to a climactic fight between Rocky and Tommy. This time the fight takes place on the streets of Philadelphia, not in a boxing ring.The biggest problem (but not the only one) with this movie is the acting. Tommy Morrison is an absolutely terrible actor. Just awful. He has a constipated look on his face in every scene and his line delivery is cringeworthy. Richard Gant hams it up as the Don King-inspired Duke character. He's just completely over-the-top and grates on the nerves very quickly. He does seem to be having more fun than anyone else in this, though. Sage Stallone does a decent job. Probably wasn't easy making his film debut opposite his superstar dad in a successful franchise. So points to him for doing as well as he did. His character is much older than he was in Rocky IV, by the way. Talia Shire and Burt Young phone their parts in. Sly seems to be parodying himself at times but still provides the movie with its heart. Burgess Meredith returns to the series for a flashback cameo and outclasses everybody else by a mile. His brief appearance is the best part of the movie.Bill Conti returns to provide music after missing Rocky IV. His score is good but the soundtrack of hip-hop songs, including the wretched ""Go For It,"" is weak. The final fight is exciting despite it not fitting in with the ""if Rocky fights again he'll die"" diagnosis given at the beginning of the film. I suppose the series had been increasingly depressing with the last two films killing off beloved characters, but the action and upbeat tone of the second halves of both of those films made it easier to take. This one is drab and ugly and, in the end, Rocky wins nothing more than meaningless bragging rights among the slack-jawed hoods cheering him on in a back alley brawl.",Rocky V
12,grantss,"Had heaps of potential, but squanders it all.",4,12 April 2015,"Had heaps of potential, but squanders it all.The first Rocky is one of the most overrated movies of all time. Implausible plot, often dull and with some of the worst performances you'll see in a movie.Rocky II was more of the same. Human drama for 90% of the film, followed by an intense fight scene. This time, however, the human drama side is more realistic and engaging and the movie flows better for it. Still not great, as it all feels kind of predictable, but it is less dull than the first movie.Rocky III was even more of the same - the template has been created and was there to be used/abused.Rocky IV used the same formula, but was just plain silly.Rocky V had the potential to be the best of the lot. It completes the life cycle of a boxer: small-time boxer to champion to defending title to has-been and retiring to be a trainer. It also showed the potential appearance of a new champion and a new Rocky, in a fighter the trainer/ex-champion coaches - the torch has been passed. It also covered the long-term effects of boxing, so shows the pluses and minuses of the sport.However, this is all for nothing. The plot ultimately degenerates into the usual Rocky vs nemesis fight at the end, with no lessons learned, and no point. It is a massive waste of opportunities.",Rocky V
13,Boba_Fett1138,Should get credit for trying to be original.,7,17 February 2005,"After 4 Rocky movies it is hard to still come up with something original again. ""Rocky V"" is trying to be different with the story, some things work and others don't but overall ""Rocky V"" is a worthy thus far last movie of the Rocky series.It's too bad that of all the Rocky movies, this is probably the one with the least 'Rocky feeling'. Yes it is great to see that after 4 Rocky movies all of the cast members are still together but the movie misses some typical kind of Rocky elements such as a spectacular boxing ending in the ring. Probably most disappointing is that Rocky doesn't return to the ring anymore, had he returned to the ring at the ending to face Tommy Gunn I would had rate this movie way higher, I'm sure about that.Still ""Rocky V"" has some good things that weren't present in the previous movies. Of all the Rocky movies this movie has far more emotions and drama. I'm sure not every Rocky fan is waiting for that but I thought it worked well for the main character.Sadly the whole Tommy Gunn character didn't worked well in the movie, mainly because, well he just ain't no Rocky and on top of that Tommy Morrison can't act. Talia Shire on the other hand once more shines as Rocky's wife.In my opinion good and original enough to watch.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Rocky V
14,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Heck of a time to come back, Avildsen",5,28 December 2016,"This is the first time I've agreed with the most common vote since II. If I ever accept that the last one got a 7, I'll feel like Lundgren looked by the end. We're back to Rocky(Sly, charming) being an low-on-money underdog, because IV was ridiculous. Of course, him losing all of it just like that isn't much better. They were running out of reasons to get him to fight, and/or delay doing so without it being out of the question. He actually has physical consequences to the climax of the one before this. Though Adrian(Shire, sweet) early on insists that he's in the best shape. ""His strength and physical stamina are extraordinary. He has had a complete medical examination that showed only positive results. Actually, his blood pressure and lab results were astonishingly excellent."" ""He will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency"" ...wait. Still, if it were realistic, this really should open with with the funeral sequence of the previous major character. That's what Francis Ford Coppola threatened to do to to Pacino. And if you think he wasn't serious, just look at his Dracula flick. Clearly, he is, or was at the time, capable of inflicting severe harm with his directing.She wants to keep him away from that, because they don't know what else to do with her. George Washington Duke is clearly Don King. There's a brief rant on his ethics. It's got the subtlety of a jab. Paulie is actually utilized this time, so that's something. Mickey gets a little emotional bit. It's nice. More so than he used to be. Of course, that could be the brain damage speaking. We get comedy with growth-spurted(9 to 14 in mere days. Must be Canadian) Jr.'s smarts and his puberty... burgeoning. I realize now it may have been a mistake to not take French. And he also has to deal with going into a bad neighborhood, after growing up rich. Just a matter of time before he'd get training montages, too. Can he get his father's attention, or will it all go to a new protégé? It'll be difficult if that man is a real-life boxer, a first for the series. Well, not ""is"", was. Freaking HIV. At least he didn't die *this* year. I'd almost bet money that before 2017 starts, at least one more celebrity will kick the bucket. And we should add ""spar"" to the list of words people in this series don't understand. Also, since it's now the 90's, there's rap on the soundtrack. A lot of it, actually. I'm relieved the flashy 90's editing was kept to a minimum. This is 96 and a half minutes without credits, and 100 with.There is a lot of violence and a little mostly mild but occasionally strong language in this. I recommend this to those who feel they *must* make it through the series. 5/10",Rocky V
15,view_and_review,Should've Stopped at Four,3,23 February 2020,"Adrian (Talia Shire) was everywhere in this movie playing mother hen. My word, Rocky could barely have a conversation without Adrian popping up to make sure hubby doesn't get hurt. First, she was worried and upset that he may continue boxing, then she was upset that he was trainer. I don't think she was happy once the entire movie. She had a perpetual look of concern like Rocky was on the edge of death.Though Rocky didn't get back into the ring he was convinced to be a trainer by a young and hungry boxer named Tommy ""the Machine"" Gunn, played by real life boxer Tommy Morrison. The portrayal is that Rocky was an absentee father as he ignored his own son in lieu of Tommy Gunn. Or you can just say that his son was fragile. I prefer the latter narrative. If I crumbled everytime my dad was working or taking care of something instead of listening to my story I'd still be in pieces. And if I ever talked to my dad the way Bobby talked to his dad I'd be in pieces and six feet under.""Rocky"" was a lot better when Rocky's struggles were with himself and his opponent. Now he has a fragile and ungrateful son and a Worry Wanda as a wife who's even more worried than she was in movies past. I guess when you get five installments into a franchise ideas get stale because the plot was asinine and the climax was a joke.You mean to tell me that immediately after a title fight the champ along with his rich promoter and a camera crew are all going to drive to the streets of Philly to challenge a retired boxer to a fight? And sure enough Rocky gets pulled into a street brawl when Tommy punched Paulie (Burt Young). And, to top it all off, somehow the filming is a live broadcast that Adrian sees so she can run down there to watch Rocky. Honestly, if Rocky was even a little smart he would've accepted a fight in the ring to get paid for getting punched in the face.As sleazy and underhanded as the promoter George Duke (Richard Gant) was, he was right about making money. I don't even blame Tommy for signing with Duke in a sense. Boxers, like all athletes, have a limited shelf life and they have to get paid as much as possible during their short career. Like Isaiah Thomas said about playing in the NBA, ""We play for championships and to make as much money as we can,"" and I don't blame them.
The movie was accurate on one point... well two. George W. Duke (Richard Gant) resembled the sleazy Don King. And secondly, Tommy Morrison was a bum. He was a flash in the pan that never accomplished anything in the ring. Now he's never accomplished anything on screen either.",Rocky V
16,Uriah43,Down but Not Out,5,11 February 2016,"After successfully defeating his formidable opponent from the Soviet Union, ""Rocky Balboa"" (Sylvester Stallone) finally gets home but once there he discovers that he has suffered irreversible brain damage. To make matters even worse, he mistakenly signed a power-of-attorney which gave his accountant access to all of his money. The accountant then proceeded to lose it all on a risky real estate deal which now leaves Rocky totally broke. So after years of physical punishment brought on by the best boxers in the world, Rocky has nothing to show for it. It's at this time that a young boxer named ""Tommy Gunn"" (Tommy Morrison) approaches him and asks Rocky to be his manager. Figuring he has nothing left to lose he decides to give it a shot. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this series has definitely featured some entertaining movies and I had hoped that this picture would be somewhat comparable. However, the drama wasn't nearly as pronounced and the action was also more restrained when compared to the previous movies. As a result, while I don't think this film was a bad movie, I also don't believe it had the same effect as its predecessors. Accordingly, I rate it as only average.",Rocky V

18,FlashCallahan,Only in America......,6,4 May 2014,"After getting permanent brain damage, Rocky Balboa is finally forced to retire from boxing. It doesn't stop him from coaching a boxer named Tommy Gunn, but when Tommy decides that Rocky isn't moving him up quickly, he soon leaves Rocky and begins his new training from Duke, a Don King style promoter.Tommy wins the title he wants, but still does not gain the respect he seeks, so he challenges Rocky to a fight, live on TV, but things don't turn out as expected, and it turns into a street brawl.One that could finish the Italian Stallion for good.It's really not as bad as you would led to believe, Stallone is as good as ever, and even though it's not following the music video routine, and tries to hark back to the originals routes, but it just doesn't have the heart that the other film have.Rocky losing everything and going back to his roots is a sound idea, and in some respects, it reflects Stallones career at the time, and his star power was slightly fading at the time of this films release.The regular cast are as good as always. Morrison is okay as Gunn, but soon becomes a whining caricature come the end, and he really deserves the beating he gets.But the film is ruined by Gants over the top portrayal of The Duke. Whenever he is on screen, it's like being in the meat locker in the first movie, there is so much ham on show.So all in all its a good story, but handled in a wrong way, and for a Rocky movie, the soundtrack sucks.But it's still touching in parts.",Rocky V
19,Aaron1375,"Granted it was the most original sequel, it still felt wrong.",3,7 March 2009,"Of the Rocky movies I have seen, this one is by far the worst. Never saw Rocky Balboa so I do not know how that one stacks up to the others. One of the many problems of this movie is its feel, it does not feel like a theatrical movie. It feels like a direct to video or maybe a television movie rather than a movie made for the theaters. I also did not like the way poor Apollo is now just an afterthought getting only one mention in the entire movie. It makes the fight against Drago just the setup for the brain trauma that Rocky suffers in this film that causes him to be unable to fight. This film also has the annoying guy doing the Don King impersonation that gets very irritating after awhile. So the story, Rocky loses all money and is forced back in to his old neighborhood where he meets and up and coming boxer named Tommy Gunn (played poorly by Tommy Morrison)who wishes Rocky to train him and gets mad when Rocky gets to much attention. Why he did not see that coming is beyond me. The movie does not really feature all that much ring boxing and the fight at the end is rather bad and not at all entertaining and the Mickey flashbacks are a bit creepy. Basically, a movie that would have been better off not being made.",Rocky V
20,Smells_Like_Cheese,It didn't make me want to go the distance and I didn't want to hit anyone :(,6,11 December 2005,"Even though desperate plea's from my friends to not see the fifth installment in the Rocky series, that it would ruin the entire image of what I thought of Rocky, I still rented it. Actually, it's not as bad as people say, but I understand why a lot of people didn't really enjoy it either.It really lost base with the original Rocky movie and it seems like Sylvester's ego is just blowing up. As Rocky, he tries to train a boxer that has potential to be the next him, his name is Tommy Gunn, and Rocky tries to be the ""Mick"" to him. While it has so much potential, it just didn't have the same inspiration as the other films did. Every Rocky film normally ends with the big boxing match against a man who it seems undefeatable to Rocky. But we always had the optimistic ending of Rocky triumphing and holding his Adrien and screaming out his love for his kid, this time it had ended on a different note.When Tommy starts to get a big head, he leaves Rocky's management for a bigger one, but after all Rocky has taught this guy, can he defeat Tommy on his own? Over all, like I said, it's not as bad as everyone says, but I can see how this wasn't that popular. So my official ranking of the Rocky films: #1 is Rocky, #2 is Rocky III, #3 is Rocky IV, #4 is Rocky II, and #5 is Rocky V. But I would recommend it if you wanna finish the series or see the 6th installment next year. I'm curious, is Rocky gonna defeat some guy while he's in a wheelchair while taking his old man medications? :D Well, I guess we'll have to see.6/10",Rocky V

However, ""Rocky"" was an exception, along with a few other films as well. But ""Rocky V"" is a who-o-o-o-ole other story.  How such a legendary, cultural impacting film such as ""Rocky"" could spawn so many lousy sequels is beyond me. Well, not really beyond me, but maybe beyond some big fans. ""Rocky V"" is a pointless, ""old"" film, that should have stopped while it was ahead -- right after the first film was released.1.5/5 stars -- John Ulmer",Rocky V
22,MovieAddict2016,"Yo, this one stinks.",6,10 August 2004,"`Touch me and I'll sue,' says a boxing promoter to Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) towards the end of `Rocky V.' Rocky hesitates, then reconsiders, clenches his fist and knocks the guy out. `Sue me for what?' he says, and walks away rather happily with his wife (Talia Shire) and son (Sage Stallone) treating him like a god.Well, how about assault? Yep, Rocky's brain ain't A-okay in `Rocky V'  his beating in the ring at the end of `Rocky IV' has gone to his head (literally) and now he can't fight again or he'll risk being the next Muhammad Ali. (Not that Rocky necessarily had any brains to begin with.)Most people complain that the `Rocky' sequels are repetitive. They forget `Rocky V': This one, rumored to be the final installment (but Sly wants to do yet another!), is totally different from all the rest. (Which is surprising, since John G. Avildsen  director of `Rocky'  returned only for this one.) I give kudos to Sly for going somewhere new with this film.Example? Unlike the predecessors, `Rocky V' takes its character out of training, throws away his fortunes, implies permanent brain damage, and basically tells us that this movie isn't going to be about boxing. Instead, it'll be about Rocky trying to adjust back to the gritty side of life. (Which isn't the perfect closing to a series that is all about a nobody becoming somebody. It's the essence of the series.)Even the final fight in `Rocky V' is wholly different from the others  it takes place outside, `on the streets,' where Rocky has an unrestricted fight with a guy two times his size. (Guess who wins.)Unfortunately, the slight originality of `Rocky V' doesn't win it any points  it is a poor movie by all standards, featuring Sylvester Stallone's worst performance as the titular character. At first it was realistic, then it sort of became comedic; by `Rocky V,' it was downright ridiculous.The dialogue is stiff and wooden. The acting is worse. And the direction is messy -- more kudos to Sly for managing to write and direct all of the `Rocky' sequels (save `V') and maintain the focus of the first. Avildsen's return behind the camera harms the movie. Why? On the Special Edition DVD of `Rocky,' Avildsen explains that he told the cinematographer to mimic the style of the first film. `But that looked like a documentary!' he was told.And so `Rocky V' looks less like a gritty, realistic documentary and more like an MTV video presentation  during the final fight, the handheld pushes in on the faces of anxious spectators, causing instant nausea. Back-and-forth it goes, again and again, rapidly moving to the beat of some 90s rock/rap song.The film chronicles Rocky's fall  Paulie (Burt Young) blows the family's fortunes, a new fighter becomes the Heavyweight Champion, and Rocky is left with the grim reality ofnothing.He takes a job at Mickey's (Burgess Meredith, who makes a flashback cameo) old gym as a trainer, which is where he coaches a new boxer, and ultimately finds a new villain to fight. The movie goes nowhere else  it isn't the bold character study that `Rocky' was, nor does it contain the uplifting, victorious underdog message.If nothing else, this proves that Rocky  the character and the films  doesn't translate well onto the screen nowadays. With firmer grasp of direction, perhaps it would  which is why, to be totally honest, I'm not so disappointed to hear that another `Rocky' could be coming along soon. I'm sure it will be a more fitting conclusion to the series than this.2/5",Rocky V

24,sddavis63,A Sad Ending To A Tired Series,2,25 July 2002,"Oh the depths to which the Academy Award winning ""Rocky"" eventually fell. I can understand Sylvester Stallone wanting to have some closure with the ""Rocky"" series by bringing it full circle - especially after the abysmal ""Rocky IV."" The problem is that this fifth installment in the series is only marginally better than the previous disaster. There might be some spoilers coming up, so beware from here on in. Everything in this movie is stale. It's been done before in the series. We even have Burgess Meredith back in this one, with either some old film that was cut from the original movie, or some new footage that he shot especially for this, as Rocky flashes back to some of the wisdom Micky shared with him (and that we've never seen before) as he prepared for his first fight with Apollo Creed. Burt Young gets to play Paulie as a drunkard again, Talia Shire (who seems particularly uninterested in playing Adrian again and doesn't seem to put much effort into the role) gets to yell ""Rocky!"" one last time and she offers a couple more pep talks, and Rocky (after being somewhat more cultured in the last couple of movies) regresses to his almost incoherent form from the original. They all seem to be playing caricatures of once great characters. There's even a caricature of Don King, in the character of the evil promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant.)Anyway the storyline is a bit silly, but here goes. Rocky is brain damaged after his fight with the giant Russian in Rocky IV. (Rocky brain-damaged? Who'd have guessed it!) So he retires, but Duke has a particularly rude fighter named Union Cane (now there's a name for a fighter) who wants a shot at the title (shades of Clubber Lang here - I told you there wasn't much original to this.) But Rocky retires, ends up managing an up and comer named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) who then dumps Rocky because he gets tired of being seen as Rocky's protege (now did he really think that as an unknown being trained by an ex-champ he'd ever escape from Rocky's shadow?) and the two of them - well, if you can sit through it you'll find out what happens in one of the dumbest endings I've ever seen to a movie.A couple of problems with the story that really bugged. (1) OK, Rocky loses all his money because of a crooked accountant. I can see that. Paulie thinks he should do endorsements. Sounds right to me. He's a two-time heavyweight champion of the world, a hero to the ""common folk."" Who better to endorse various products? But his handlers say ""no."" Seems no company would want him as a spokesman because of a minor criminal conviction many years ago. But then his people argue for a return to the ring, based on his immense popularity. Huh? If he's so immensely popular why couldn't he get endorsements? That doesn't make sense to me. (2) After having to move back to the old neighbourhood, Rocky is worried that his son is going to be the target of toughs at his new school. A reasonable concern. So, to make him him seem really tough I guess, Rocky walks him to school the first day and in front of the school toughs calls out ""Daddy loves you."" (?) That's really going to help. And Rocky Jr. seems a bit too old for all the hugs and kisses dad gives him - my opinion anyway.Anyway, it's very sad to see how far the ""Rocky"" franchise fell after an Oscar-winning beginning and two relatively entertaining sequels. This one gets 2/10, only because - as I said - it's marginally better than its horrible predecessor.",Rocky V
25,FeastMode,my notes,5,26 June 2019,"Stupidly fun and entertaining movie that went in a different direction. but way too many dumb moments, cliches, and old movie qualities. the son side plot was useless and terrible, made me laugh a bunch of times (2 viewings)",Rocky V
26,Robert_duder,A fitting film for #1800 reviews and Sly's special Day,6,7 July 2016,"This is 1800 reviews for me and I usually try to pick something important to me for these milestone reviews. There isn't much more important to me than the films of Sly Stallone for a number of reasons, some more personal than others. I just went through the Rocky Series again for the umpteenth time loving them as much as I ever have but I had yet to review Rocky V so here I am. And the irony is that this is considered the worst of the series and rightfully so. It is definitely a departure from the franchise. There are some good things about it but the problem is that it doesn't feel like Rocky. It doesn't have the same heart or style and the fact that it ends in this street fight just feels so un-Rocky like. However, it does definitively show a huge arc in the character we all know and love. Truly thank goodness, Rocky Balboa came out 16 years later to do justice to the franchise and not leave it on this note. The positive thing is that this is still about rising above. It's watching Rocky struggle as he loses everything and has to start from the beginning. It also sets him up basically for the rest of his life as we find out in Rocky Balboa and later Creed.I'm sure I've said this before but anyone who claims Sylvester Stallone can't act or is untalented needs to look again. He is an incredible Oscar-winning writer who created this indelible character who has lasted forty years successfully. Even in Rocky V which is disliked greatly, he is still the hero he always was and the character that is perfectly crafted by Stallone. He literally turns into Rocky and you're mesmerized. The scene with him watching Gunn fight and his brain issues is disturbing almost bringing tears to my eyes. Stallone is a powerhouse even if this is his worst script for writing. Happy 70th Birthday Mr. Stallone, my hero, my larger than life idol. The entire cast returns, Taila Shire gives her final Adrian performance and definitely has some great scenes and still has incredible chemistry opposite Stallone. Burt Young almost plays a bit of an accidental ""bad guy"" as he is the cause of Rocky losing everything. This is a toned down performance for him but he is still an integral part of the series. Sage Stallone is actually the scene stealer in this film. Sage is fantastic as the young Rocky Jr. The best part of this film is the dynamic between Sage and his real life father Sly. This film revolves around father and son and does that one aspect of it well. More or less his only film credit, real life Heavyweight Boxer (briefly) Tommy Morrison plays Rocky's protégé turned nemesis Tommy Gunn. Morrison doesn't hold a candle to any of other Rocky's nemesis in the films and certainly not to the first 4. He doesn't even seem to be in the same boat. Morrison and Michael Anthony Cane who plays a blatant attempt at Don King are both very cheesy and B-Movie quality which drags down the film significantly.Besides Rocky being the underdog and a force of nature the thing fans love about this series are training montages and the final fight. Rocky V has neither of this. And not only do you not get an epic final boxing bout in a the King of Boxing epics but it's reduced to a street fight that is okay at best. I am actually floored that this was directed by John G. Avildsen who directed the original Rocky. But maybe he got lucky with that one? If you look at all his other films over 4 decades, nothing else stands out as being impressive or a work of art. He certainly knows how to give Rocky and his Philadelphia world that grit and poor look but this is a weak script with very little to be impressed by or remember in this series. Still as a huge fan, I watch it every time I go through the franchise because it belongs and it has it's plus' (the Stallones' for one thing) and it's important for Rocky's story because this was his real life down and out before he came thundering back 16 years later with the incredible Rocky Balboa. 6.5/10",Rocky V
27,ElMaruecan82,"Despite a few powerful moments, the lowest point of the ""Rocky"" franchise",5,20 August 2017,"In 1972, Stallone couldn't even be an extra in ""The Godfather"". In 1976, he wrote and starred in the year's Best Picture, classic underdog story and franchise starter ""Rocky"". And Roger Ebert saw in him a new Brando.The 80's didn't exactly prove Ebert right but they consolidated his star-status. 1982 was his peak with the success of ""Rocky III"" and the release of ""First Blood"" that introduced another landmark of American cinema: John Rambo. The rest of the decade had its share of ups-and-downs making Sly actor and/or director a punching ball for the Razzies. His ""Rocky IV"", while the most successful sport-movie of all time wasn't exactly a critical success, even among the fans.So 1990 wasn't exactly Sly's finest hour with his starlight fading in favor of rivals like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. That convinced him to approach Rocky with the same angle. There's always a parallel between Rocky and Stallone's story and the idea of taking Rocky back to his roots, to simpler values like family and friends was actually good. The 80's were over, the iron curtain was open, and Gordon Gekko in jail. But from Stallone's own admittance, he made the film out of greed and rated it a zero. So maybe what lacked in ""Rocky V"" was a sincere approach to a material that looked good on the paper.Taking Rocky back to the blue-collar streets of Philadelphia was only viable if there was a good story-line to justify it. Unfortunately, ""Rocky V"" while not a mediocre film never really fulfills its potential, despite many touching moments, it often gets lost in the realms of cheap predictable made-for-TV stuff. Stallone is wrong when he gives the film a 'zero', he's a good actor, passable director, great writer when he puts his heart in but not much of a critic. Some scenes in ""V"" belong to the best of the franchise and make it even better than ""Rocky IV"", which was build on a predictable 'death-followed-by-revenge' plot, the story-line of every 80's sports movie.But I love the way ""Rocky V"" puts you in the Drago match' immediate aftermath, with Rocky shaking and trembling like a frail puppy, asking Adrian to take him home, you could tell he was tired of this 'nonsense'. But then the press conference back in America features so many cringe-worthy moments every hope in cinematic excellence had definitely vanished. I couldn't believe journalists would ask Rocky for a come-back the minute he set his feet on the American ground, I wanted him to pull a Tony Montana and shout ""What was the Drago hit- a game of dominoes or something?"". So many things belonged to the 'Idiot Script' formula, when you wait for one line to be said, but it doesn't come because you've got to wait for the most dramatic instant.Rocky could tell the journalists that he was suffering from brain damage and the case was rested. The film even involves a subplot with the growing father-and-son relationship between Rocky as a mentor and Tommy ""Machine"" Gun, making his son Rocky Jr. jealous, but instead of talking to his father, Jr. becomes more and more rebellious until we get to the obligatory confrontation where they come to terms. And the moment where Rocky makes up with his son is conveniently the same where Tommy turns into a one-dimensional ungrateful villain, it's not exactly the kind of smooth transition we're getting used to. It took Rocky, Adrian and Paulie three, four movies to evolve, Rocky Jr. and Tommy one hour.This is the same kind of flaw that undermined ""Rocky IV"", when characters start to behave according to a script rather than a realistic arc, just like Apollo when he was teasing and mocking a Russian giant who was obviously in better shape, as if his defeats with Rocky didn't humble him a bit. It's a shame that Stallone didn't rewrite the script, because Rocky Jr. and Tommy were interesting characters, and well played by the two deceased actors Sage Stallone and Tommy Morrison but it seems like the purpose of their presence was to highlight some need from Rocky to pass the torch, to be the Mickey of someone. Fair enough, but I hated the way relationships always worked on the kind of binary ""On/Off"" level that damaged the film's credibility.But the biggest flaw of all was that poor man's Don King played by Richard Grant, he chewed the script every time he was in, and was like the most irritating presence, where was this guy in the previous Rocky? Who the hell was this Union Cane? They even went as far as calling him George Washington Duke while there's another Duke in the film, to add to the confusion. The film is set in 1985 but it is obvious we're in 1990, if new boxing figures were to come, if Rocky had to lose money and get poor again, and last but not least, if Robert 'Rocky' Jr. was supposed to be 14, then just set the film five years after the fourth, and at least, you'll gain a few points in credibility and not have one of the most inexplicable goofs ever.The film, directed by the late John G. Avidsen featured some really powerful scenes, including a flashback with Mickey, allowing us to see Burgess Meredith one last time, a great confrontation between Rocky and Adrian, and an interesting ending showing how Tommy was more of a mislead guy than a villain but ""Rocky V"" tangles way too much between mediocrity and excellence. Well, let's call it uneven despite good intentions.Or maybe we should be thankful it flopped, since it allowed Rocky to make his great ""Rocky Balboa"" which revitalized the franchise and allowed ""Creed"" and a second Oscar nomination to happen. In 1990, the franchise was over but you know what Rocky says about things being over, right?",Rocky V

A movie about being able to distinguish true values in life from current goals that blur the mind. The movie is not excellent in any aspect, but the story is the most interesting so far. Rocky's son is portrayed by Stallone's son, which gives this father-son relationship more credibility.

32,ironhorse_iv,Even if it try. Rocky V couldn't fight itself out of a paper bag. This movie is super weak. It's not worth going for it.,5,26 August 2019,"This fifth movie and apparently then conclusion in the series, was not good. It turn away so many fans. So far, it's the only film in the Rocky saga to have lost money at the box office. Directed by John G. Avildsen, the flick tells the story of boxer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) learning how to deal with retirement after suffering numerous concussions, meanwhile training a new fighter Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) to take his place. Without spoiling the movie too much, thank God for 2006 'Rocky Balboa' & 2015 'Creed', because the franchise could had ended with a sour note. Originally pitch with the boxer meeting his end with an unplanned street fight. The film's climax was rewritten by Stallone after noticing how overall unpleasant, it was. So he changed it for the better; which was the best decision. The whole idea of him giving up and dying very weakly goes against everything that the franchise was teaching its viewers. Regardless, the new ending still didn't go the distance. It didn't really resolve any of Rocky's financial & fatherhood issues with his son Robert (Sage Stallone). That's one of the biggest faults of the movie. We never got to see if the boxer would be alright with putting his gloves away for good and survive through other means. It felt unfinished. In fact, a big takeaway here is that violence is still the best and perhaps only way to solve any and all conflicts. Be it Rocky's issues with over the top cartoony character, George Washington Duke (Richard Gant) or Robert's bullies. That's isn't really a good moral message when you think about it. After all, being brave doesn't mean, you go out looking for trouble. As for the music. It's mostly a miss for me. This movie doesn't have best training montage to pump up. The hip hop music is really dated and doesn't really related much to what happening in the film. It's honestly pretty disappointing to listen to. Plus, I hate that ""Gonna Fly Now"" is not never really heard in the film. Regardless, the action scenes throughout the film, still look pretty fake and hokey even with the alternate fight work print. The hits don't even land at times. It's sucks, because Morrison was honestly a really good boxer in real life. Although, the action scenes with him were below average, his acting was decent. He really did some great delivery with passion at certain parts in the film. One such example was the dinner scene where Tommy talks about his father. Nevertheless, it's Michael Williams, the other boxer performer that really fall flat here. Not only is his shadow boxing, very poor in the film, but he barely shows any characteristics as Union Cane. While, it's true that Williams and Morrison were to have an actual match about a month after this movie was released. It had to be canceled, because Williams hurt himself. As for Stallone, he was alright in the film. I do like his acting even if Rocky's lethal form of 'brain damage', was inaccurate portrayal. Regardless, it's just nice to see the effects of head injuries like concussions being actually honest meaningful discussed here, even if it was briefly shown. His chemistry with his son was fine. Sage was also alright as an actor, despite being a little annoying at parts. As for Adrian (Talia Shire) Rocky's wife, Shire as a performer isn't given much to do, besides being supported. She was just fine in the role. Unfortunately, one subplot I didn't really like was the boxer's brother in law Paulie (Burt Young) falling for unrealistic schemes and losing nearly all of Rocky's money. Especially when Paulie never once apologize or try to make amends. That character is just too unlikeable in this movie. Yet, Rocky is willing to defend him even till in the end. It makes no logical sense. It didn't seem real. The movie would had work better if Rocky was defending his son's honor rather than Paulie. After all, it's Robert that suffer the most from Tommy's actions. As for idea of them, moving back to the slums. It felt like an unrealistic extreme setback. Even with the limited amount of money, they should had been more well off than they were portrayal. Don't get me wrong, 'fall from grace' storylines are great, but unfortunately this felt like a rethread. We already saw them deal with money problems and injuries in the 1979 sequel 'Rocky II'. This film didn't give us, much of anything new. Honestly, the movie would had work better if the 'riches to rags' story took place somewhere else than the Kensington area of Philadelphia. Look I get that having it take place in that area, was obvious attempt to recapture the magic and charm of the original 1976 movie, but awkwardly, it felt more jarring than emotional impactful, especially in parts, such as Rocky visiting his old gym or Adrian being forced to get her old job at the pet shop back. While the director's cut version explains those scenes with more context and reasons with Marie (Jodi Letizia) reprising her role from the first movie as an emotional backdrop. Her scenes near the bar along with some of the flashbacks of Mickey (Burgess Meredith) were sadly cut from the theatrical film. Because of that, we never really got to truly understand why Rocky act the way, he does. It was muddled much in the same way, how Robert age from five to ten between films. Overall: This is the only film in the franchise so far, that I really do hate. Sadly, like most of the audience, this movie was not a huge hit with me. Because of that, it was not quite the knockout, I was hoping for. It truly didn't rock my world.",Rocky V

The best thing about the first three this that they were p.e.r.c.u.s.s.e.r.e.s to this one and Rocky IV. Rocky IV is the is a little better. But still this is a great movie. Just because movie is part five does not make it awful. And just because a movie is part one dose not make it the greatest thing since sliced bread. This movie as a great story line. It also has great acting. This is one of few Rocky movies were there is more to it then trying to win a title or trying to keep one. This one has characters that actually counts as being a bad guys.

34,slightlymad22,Misunderstood,8,23 January 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to 1990's Rocky V.Plot In A Paragraph: Forced in to retirement, Rocky (Stallone) returns to Philadelphia bankrupt, he starts to train an up and coming fighter. Since the last time Sly played Rocky, rival muscle man Arnold Schwarzenegger was growing in popularity in the late 80's, whilst Stallones popularity was on the slide, following a string of movies that under performed (including a new Rambo) so he went back to his old pal Rocky to save the day and revive his career. Sadly this time it did not work.Rocky V is possibly one of the most misunderstood movies in Stallone's filmography. OK he over acts at times, but the heart is back in to the franchise and Stallone is playing Rocky again, unlike IV, where it was just like watching any other Stallone flick. Sadly audiences didn't want to see Rocky lose all his money and end up back where he started and they stayed away in droves.It has some great scenes. The Mickey flashback is a real high point, and the street fight (although awfully edited) is fun too. Bill Conti is back scoring the music to the movie, sadly a lot of 90's rap music is also present too!! Stallone rates this Rocky 0/10 which I think is very harsh. I'm in the minority of people who thinks this is a better Rocky movie than the much more successful Rocky IV.",Rocky V
35,zkonedog,Coming Full Circle,8,11 March 2017,"The legend of Rocky Balboa grew out of the harsh streets of Philadelphia, and in this ""final"" (at the time) installment, that is exactly the place where the tale winds down.For a basic plot summary, ""Rocky V"" finds the title character (Sylvester Stallone) having sustained irreversible brain damage after the Drago fight and thus forced into retirement. When Paulie (Burt Young) makes a financial snaffu, the Balboa family loses their fortune and must return to their old living quarters in Philly. While there, Rocky begins training a young, hungry fighter named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison), while Rocky Jr. (Sage Stallone) struggled to cope with his new environment.Likely due to a change in direction (Stallone hands the reins back to John Avildson), this film is more like the original than any of the other sequels, from the tone of the drama to the actual locations. This turns out to be a smart move for the franchise, as it allows for a bit of closure (coming full circle) to the overall narrative. It never ceases to amaze me that Stallone was able to keep the Rocky Balboa character so fresh, considering how most of his other film ""icons"" are anything but.There are two very hokey situations that you must first get over in order to enjoy this movie:1. The aging of Rocky Jr. When Rocky leaves for Russia in the fourth film, his son isn't more than 8-9 years old. When Rocky comes back, still sporting the bruises from Drago, his kid is in roughly late middle school. This is a huge continuity issue in order to make other portions of the movie make sense dramatically.2. Paulie losing all of Rocky's money. Couldn't director Avildson have come up with anything better than that for why the Balboa's have to move back to Philadelphia?If you can put those concerns in the rear view mirror, though, than there are plenty of themes/moments in this film that will entertain you:-The Don King clone, which was (is?!) a real issue in boxing during the 1980s and 90s. -The Rocky/Tommy relationship, which is fated for failure right from the get-go but still makes you feel for Rocky since he can no longer physically enter the ring. -The son angle. Rocky tries to ""do for"" his family to make up for the lost fortune, but eventually realizes that all he needs to do is ""do with"" them in order to preserve the family unit. -A touching scene at the old gym in which Rocky reminisces about former trainer Mick (Burgess Meredith). Perhaps the greatest single scene in the entire franchise. -Of course, what would a Rocky film be without a fight scene, but in this case it takes place on the streets, not within a squared circle. The drama is palpable in those final minutes.To me, this film was a fitting end for the Rocky franchise (until, of course, it wasn't once Stallone resurrected the franchise this millennium). A few things don't jive, but by-and-large it still provides the character development and high drama that the Rocky series has come to be known for. For whatever reason, Sly Stallone himself has pretty much stricken this movie from the Rocky ""anthology"" because of his deep hatred for it, but I don't see the reasoning. I enjoyed it through and through.",Rocky V
36,johnnyboyz,"Fresh fights for Rocky and the Balboa clan, but most of the 'hard hitting' you'll see is the depiction of their living conditions.",6,12 April 2013,"The ground that the Rocky films have treaded has become so visibly worn; so evidently eroded, that one might just as well usurp the Rocky statue perched at the top of those concrete steps over there in Philadelphia and entrench it beside the path synonymous with this franchise, so that whenever a screenwriter decides to traverse said path, may they be reminded just where they're headed. Then again, maybe those steps ARE indeed the physical manifestation of such a path, and the statue is in the right place anyway; a public thoroughfare whose appearance in these Rocky films is about as expected as the training montages and the 'final fight' sequence. It is pleasing, then, to be able to say that the positives outweigh the negatives in 1990's Rocky V; a very, very goofy film but not totally devoid of quality. What indeed appears to merely be old ground once again being traversed turns out to be a film mostly about a family and about relationships people have outside of the ring It is to this extent one dares to say that upon its release, Rocky V was the best Rocky film since the '76 original.The film will kick off with Stallone's Rocky Balboa arriving back in America following his brutal fight with Dolph Lundgren's young Soviet that climaxed the last film. A national hero, Rocky is barely off the airport grounds before a press conference is called in a hangar such is the demand - but our eponymous boxer skirts informing them of the health issues he has due to his taking of all the Russian punishment and additionally shies away from a fresh challenge from an exuberant black promoter; their tough young runt fighter and a shady looking white agent. Actually, it is his wife Adrian (Shire) doing all the talking in this regard, and we're reminded again of the last film when Drago's partner did all of his talking at his conferences. Looking forward to retirement in his huge Philadelphia mansion chock full of mementos and his loving family, disaster strikes when it's revealed someone as reckless; knock-about and often drunk as Paulie (Burt Young, Adrian's brother and Rocky's brother in law) has botched all of their money away to an accountant and his bad real estate schemes. Leaving his financial adviser's office, Rocky and Adrian walk over a reflection on the floor made by a circular window just above them: the design has it look like they're walking through a sniper's crosshair as the elements zero in on them. With no money, Stallone troops his characters back to their greyer, bleaker beginnings – wherein Adrian worked in a pet shop and Balboa himself paid regular trips to Burgess Meredith's old sparring gym: there is a flashback of unrealistic proportions in length once he's back there when he remembers a little too much of a training session he once had with Meredith.Things plough on and Balboa's son, Rocky jnr (played by Stallone's real life son Sage), winds up at a school that sees him have to deal with a bully problem via his fists –perhaps designed to echo how his father and Apollo Creed were once rivals until they came to mutually appreciate one another through their time spent fighting. Mirroring the realism in Stallone casting his own son to play his son is true-to-life boxer Tommy Morrison playing Tommy Gunn, a well-spoken and enthusiastic young fighter from Oklahoma who turns up looking for Balboa, his idol, to coach him into a being a professional. I even read that Morrison took up boxing after seeing the original Rocky film anyway reinforcing this more grounded, realistic tract the film has. There is this sense that, having gone through the pain barriers and having climbed the ladder culminating in a fight abroad with the likes of Ivan Drago, there is nowhere else to go after representing one's county. That final composition of Rocky IV that features a Stars-and-Stripes draped Balboa having conquered the Communist enemy, one of the franchise's more famous images, could be seen as the culmination of a man's career: where does one go from there? In spite of the evident hypothesis, the film is not without its faults, although its positives outweigh its negatives. The strand about Rocky's son falling out with Rocky out of not paying him enough interest is weak: your father's working, leave him alone, while this manic idea the film seems to think is more substantial than it actually is, that Gunn is replacing Rocky junior as the son-like figure, is just silly. What tries to make itself apparent, however, is the notion of just how much Gunn hated his own father when he was younger, and if the film would like Balboa to adopt this fatherly/mentoring role for Gunn where he is substituting his own son, the later rivalry between the two carries with it this dynamic of resurfaced spite on Gunn's behalf.But we enjoy the film overall, it feels more mature than the previous sequels; as if it's telling a movie about sports and those involved in sports instead of a movie with sports in it. This atmosphere of things shifting; things moving on is apparent by the hour mark, when Gunn fills in as the film's protagonist for a while and the young, Creed/Lang-lite black challenger from the opening has been pushed out of proceedings as the potential opponent for Rocky's latest bout. When the final fight does eventually come around, we observe the film's final act of resistance to submitting to hardened formula when it arrives in the form of a street fight more-so an official, ring set clash. Ultimately, the series has not been as toned down as this since its first film, and Rocky V is all the more better because of it.",Rocky V
37,leplatypus,The last round for  Adrian (payTV),10,10 October 2016,"I think that this 5th movie in the franchise is less appreciated than the others because it marks the beginning of a new era : Bye- bye the electric 80s and welcome to the gritty 90s : now rock hits or glorious soundtrack become rap music ; Downtown Philadelphia looks like Haiti ! Money perverts sports and violence becomes the way to deal personal problems. In that light, there's no reason that Rocky would be different. It's true that when i saw it on screen back in 1990, i was not very convinced. Today, i don't really mind because the soap stories are rather interesting and offer us to enjoy for the last time Talia and for sure Stallone's kid. According to his late fate, his difficult but close relationship with his father is rather moving. If the movie has less punch than before, it's also because Rocky loses a lot : the mansion, his son, his pupil, his health But the scene in which he fights in front of his TV is rather inspired. Honestly, the alternative ending fight doesn't bring much and don't change the conclusion. If i reviewed Rocky 6, i still haven't watched Rocky 7 and i'm not really motivated as for me Adrian was half of the soul of the saga so without her, things are not what they used to be ! NB : To add something funny, we can also notice that the Russian airspace has an gate for an alternative earth as coming back from there, Rocky finds a older son and a totally new mansion !",Rocky V

The seeds of a good movie are there but they were never given the chance to develop. ""Rocky V"" has the feeling of a movie that rushed into production. I'm a fan of Sylvester Stallone but he didn't do a very job with ""Rocky V"". The script and dialogue aren't so hot. He has a couple of nice moments on screen but he has a few bad ones too. I don't want to say that Sly mailed it in on this one but he comes close. The rest of the cast isn't very good either. Both Tommy Morrison and Sage Stallone are in over their heads.

40,Anonymous_Maxine,Let the overacting begin!,6,8 December 2008,"As I got to Part 5, I was amazed that none of the Rocky movies were bad. Part 5 is the weakest of the entire series, but in a series this long there are almost always at least one or two that are just train wrecks, but the only really bad thing about Rocky 5 is that Stallone overacts so much. There is a definite feeling that by now we understand the majority of Rocky's life as an amateur and then professional boxer. By this point, it's not hard to watch the movie feeling like you know him personally.I think what made the Rocky movies so good and the Rambo movies so bad is that Rocky is just an incredibly likable person, while Rambo was tragically born without a shred of personality.It seems that Paulie has unknowingly signed over power of attorney to their accountant, who did a little gambling with the Balboas' money thinking he could win big and then return it before they even knew it was gone, and ultimately they end up losing millions. They are forced to sell everything and basically start over back in the same neighborhood where Rocky lived before he fought Apollo Creed.Thankfully, the son has been recast after they cast that goofy white kid in Part 4, although now he's a rich, geeky, spoiled punk. He has become accustomed to living the good life and sinks into depression when they have to sell all of their material possessions and revert back to the sad life that his father grew up in. When they move to the bad neighborhood his naiveté makes me think of an ignorant prince gleefully attempting to mingle with the common folk, thinking maybe he can make friends with them by commenting on how charming and cute their poor lifestyle is. Dumbass.Soon Rocky is preoccupied with a promising and ambitious young boxer that he meets one day on the street corner. His son is preoccupied with the punks that keep beating him up at school but Rocky never seems to have time for him anymore because he's putting so much time and energy into training this new guy, curiously named Tommy Gunn. Unfortunately, things pretty soon begin to go south when the press keeps labeling Tommy ""Rocky's Pupil,"" ""Clone,"" ""Robot,"" etc.The conflict of the film is centered on Rocky not allowing Tommy to fight for George Washington Duke, a major boxing promoter who wants to make Tommy his next protégé. The problem is that the conflict comes from Rocky telling Tommy that Duke doesn't care about him, he only wants to make money off him and then throw him away when he's no good anymore, but in the real world there's really no problem with Tommy fighting for Duke.Yeah, Duke has no personal interest in the guy and no emotional connection, but all Tommy wants is a chance at a real career in boxing. He doesn't need a best friend or a father figure, he just wants to get recognized and make some money. And Duke could probably make that happen a lot better than Rocky could.But Rocky is Rocky and we love him, so when Tommy disrespects him, taunting him and challenging him to a fight to prove himself once and for all, we want to see Tommy have his ass handed to him. Rocky, meanwhile, has developed neural damage from all the blows to the head that he's received throughout his career, making a prize fight impossible because no doctor is fool enough to give him medical approval to fight.From there, the movie goes in a slightly different direction. It's not as exciting and big as the previous movies, but is still a good ride. The biggest problem with the movie, however, is the son, who is not only a rich geek but also an arrogant little bastard with no respect for his mother or father or anyone else. He throws a hissy fit on Christmas Day and takes off with his little friend, and soon even shows up wearing this long, dangling earring and talking all tough to his dad. I haven't seen a kid in such need of a good smack since Stallone's other son in Over The Top. WOW.The problem is that Rocky is too benevolent and too likable, so when his son acts like this, it is only natural to side with Rocky and wish he would just send the little punk off to military school or something, but instead Rocky works to earn his respect. The movie goes in a completely different direction than the previous films and is noticeably less impressive, but the heart's in the right place and when it comes to Rocky movies, that's the most important thing",Rocky V

It was like they changed the focus back on the characters but somehow butchered it in the process. The result was just horrible.It wasn't the lack of Rocky fighting or the fact that Tommy Gun was kind of an evil traitorous friend that used him and then walked away... it was how they handled it.It could have been the start of a good story of Rocky as a trainer, but it ended up just being awful. The dramatic family dynamic was shot and it turned into a mess with a convoluted story that hinted at being decent, but always missed the boat.It should have been the more personal story, but it stopped being personal the moment Tommy Gun walked on screen and it turned into a mess that didn't seem to know which way it should go.However... the same basic concept was used with Creed, and this time (despite it's FORGIVABLE faults in the script, it was done right).

44,ackstasis,"""All those fighters you beat, you beat them with heart, not muscle. That's what Mickey knew; that's why Mickey and you were special.""",6,22 February 2007,"Coming into the most lowest-regarded 'Rocky' sequel (amongst both critics and passionate fans of the series), I must admit that I felt a certain trepidation. Whilst I had enjoyed the wildly over-the-top shenanigans of 'Rocky IV,' it wasn't what you'd call a good film, and had simply become the clichéd story of a champion boxer's underdog victory, not making any attempts to expand on the character of Rocky Balboa or his relationship with family and friends. Rocky's fifth outing is generally considered to be considerably worse, frequently denounced by Stallone himself.Whilst 'Rocky V' is most certainly not a classic, I can admire what it was attempting. Whilst Sylvester Stallone himself had helmed the first three sequels, 'Rocky V' was directed by John G. Avildsen, winner of a Best Director Oscar for the original film. This film attempts to break the mould set by the sequels, most notably by not including any scenes with Rocky in the boxing ring (except, of course, for the obligatory flashback opening to Rocky's bout of the previous film). Having been diagnosed with brain damage from his clash with Ivan Drago, Rocky is done with fighting. To make matters worse, he loses his entire fortune when his brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young) mistakenly signs the power-of-attorney over to a dodgy accountant. To fill the void in his life, Rocky begins training others to box, taking an enthusiastic, hungry young boxer, Tommy ""The Machine"" Gunn (Tommy Morrison), under his wing.Rocky perceptibly sees, in Tommy, a younger version of himself; under-privileged, but avid for glory, and willing to take any steps to achieve it. In helping Tommy, however, Rocky grows further apart from his son, Rocky Jr. (played by Sage Stallone, and looking as though his character has aged about five years in the time that it took for Rocky to return from Russia) and his loving wife Adrian (Talia Shire). Rocky Jr., an intelligent young lad in his early teens, feels neglected by his father and takes up boxing in an attempt to get noticed, eventually becoming a rebellious street punk.Often misunderstood - and reviled by many fans for a lack of ""action"" - 'Rocky V' is a competent addition the series, and is, at least, superior to its direct predecessor. Unlike 'IV,' this Rocky film attempts (albeit, only partially successfully) to develop Rocky's character, and his family relationships. There is even a stirring flashback featuring Mickey (Burgess Meredith), quite possibly the most powerful moment in the film. Paulie is rescued from the role of comic-relief, and actually has something relevant to say. Adrian and Rocky face challenges, and their commitment is tested, but they manage to pull through. The film brings viewers back to the scenario of the original film  Rocky is no longer wealthy and living the easy life. He is back where he started, and must fight his way back to glory, not with his own failing body, but through Tommy. The only problem is that Tommy, despite having the ambition and the skill, lacks Rocky's passion and heart, resulting in his own eventual downfall.",Rocky V
45,mjneu59,down for the count,2,30 December 2010,"When it comes to boxing films, there's 'Raging Bull' and then there's just plain bull. The fifth chapter in the interminable saga of America's favorite pugilist presents a kinder, gentler Rocky Balboa, down but hardly out after his flag-waving triumph against the Soviets in 'Rocky IV'. The new film was meant to be a return to roots, for both Stallone and his alter ago, but humility was never Rocky's strongest virtue, and his fall from grace barely registers as an inconvenience (notice how Rocky himself is innocent in his own downfall, and how the adulation of his fans doesn't waver, before or afterward). Even the suggested brain damage (is this something new?) never quite becomes an issue; it certainly doesn't stop him from beating the crap out of his rogue protégé in the climactic fist fight, actually more a street brawl than a boxing contest. Elsewhere Stallone's screenplay favors domestic soap opera over fisticuffs, with some predictably sloppy father/son bonding trauma lending it all the conviction of a Hallmark greeting card. It may be hard to believe, but the film is even more cheap and sloppy than its predecessors, if such a thing is even possible.",Rocky V

The premise of this film sees rocky forced to retire so he ends up training a protégé so he can have a new lease on life. Meanwhile, his son struggles in school. Now Sylvester Stallone is great in this film and easilly the best part of this film. I actually believed that he wanted to get back in the ring and I saw the pain in his character. However, I didn't like anybody else in this film, whether it was returning characters such as Adrian because they didn't add anything to the film. Also I thought his son was annoying throughout the film. I also didn't feel like Tommy gunn was a particular strong character. The story was just all over the place. Whether it was the Stallone and gunn relationship which had a really forced conclusion that I didn't like. Also I hated the sins story arc and felt it was a stupid part of the film. The script had some decent dramatic dialogue but the humour just want there like it had been in previous films.

47,CubsandCulture,Weirdly unsure of itself,5,18 March 2019,"Of all the Rocky films this is the only one that I don't think really works on its own or in continuity. (I think this is why it is often ignored and the 3 later films basically don't acknowledge its existence). The film is really caught between telling a traditional Rocky story where he becomes an underdog, trains for fight while dealing with interpersonal stuff and has a big fight and a Creed like story where Rocky transitioned into a mentor of a younger fighter. Neither story is told well and both suffer by trying to combine them. I still don't know why the screenplay felt the need to have the promoter character and Tommy's betrayal. There is a stronger simpler story of Rocky just training a younger fighter.The family stuff is pat and ill advised. Paulie is saddled with a very dumb and callous (even for him) mistake in order to get the family back into a blue collar setting. Add in Rocky and Adrian never really get in an extensive fight with Paulie about his mistake and the whole conflict feels hollow. Likewise, the subplot of Rocky Jr. being bullied is resolved too easily. Nothing really gels and coheres in this film.There are still a few touching and/or effective scenes in the film. Anything involving Mickey is great. The medical consequences of boxing at least are mentioned as a plot point. The training scenes with Rocky and Tommy showed promise for a different story dynamic. The final fight is absolutely nonsensical on the plot level but it is utterly brutal and it is fitting that Rocky has one fight like that in his career.This could have been so much better.; It makes for a terrible conclusion of the original run of films.",Rocky V

So they move back to the ghetto and Rocky trains young upstart, Tommy Gunn, who is a huge fan of Rocky's. Rocky distances himself from his family and resentment from them towards him grows. When Tommy betrays Rocky, he learns he must fight once more. The first problem is getting Stallone's real son, Sage, to play his son in this. Rocky's son ages 5 years in 1 month. The next problem is how easily they moved back to the slums of Philly. Rocky is the biggest boxer in the world, so why didn't he do some commercials and other celebrity endorsements like he did in Rocky 3? These are the only problems I have with this.What makes this movie great and the most original is the distinct message, subplots, and final fight. In every Rocky movie, the message is to follow your dreams and don't give up. They are conveyed differently in each of them. This one's main message is the importance of family. As Rocky's trainings were growing stronger and stronger, the respect from his family grew weaker and weaker. When Rocky finally does wake up, that last bit has a huge impact. Also, the subplots were great too, just like the others. The main and best one is crooked fight promoter, George W. Duke worming his way in Rocky's affair and Tommy's rise. Rocky knows all about people like him that do well at first then drain their clients dry. But Tommy doesn't. This subplot happens all the time in real life and is great to see on film. The last great thing is the final between Rocky and Tommy. Tommy challenges Rocky to a fight anywhere, which ends up being on the streets at that moment. The street fight is very well done. All haters of Rocky V admit that they loved the fight between Rocky and Tommy. Some say it might be the best in the series.4/4",Rocky V
53,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,It is the least likable of the series but it is worth the time to see anyway,5,20 June 2015,"It is already well known that when a popular franchise starts making sequels well after the first trilogy, there better be something for new audiences and fans a like to enjoy. Although most producers do have this in mind, there's always that group that don't and make rehash after rehash after rehash of the same film. This has been seen in dozens of film series, some of which have pulled themselves out of mindless entertainment to crowd-flocking blockbusters and others from once respected initiators to abysmal box office bombs. The unfortunate thing is, most head down the wrong path. As for Sylvester Stallone's first entry into Hollywood with Rocky (1976), it struck such a memorable chord that Stallone ended up exploiting his fictional counterpart for a decade and then some. Sadly for many, if not all fans of this boxing franchise have found this entry to be the least enjoyable. Of which they are right but it certainly isn't garbage like some have said including Stallone himself shockingly.For what it's worth, although it does have a couple more problems than Rocky III (1982) and Rocky IV (1985), this fifth entry isn't simply a rehash in plot like the last two films. After returning home from his fight with Drago in Russia, Rocky and family head home only to realize they lose everything when they discover Paulie (Burt Young) lent all of the Balboa savings to a shady accountant that ended up committing fraud on their behalf. Having to sell majority of their possessions to have cash on hand, the Balboa family moves back to Philadelphia hoping to start a new. There, Rocky reopens Mickey's (Burgess Meredith) boxing hall but is continuously followed and harassed by George Washington Duke (Richard Grant) who is looking to get him back into the ring to make one more check of big money. However Adrian (Talia Shire) disagrees because after visiting the doctor it seems as if Rocky has irreversible brain damage that could get worse if he continues to fight.Trying to stay out of the ring, Rocky discovers a boxer named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) who he ends up taking under his wing. The writing, which was penned again by Sylvester Stallone although a little cluttered, at least has things to discuss. Unlike Rocky III (1982) and Rocky IV (1985), which were very straight cut and predictable this time there's things to think about. For those who are tired of the usual Rocky formula that consisted of ""promising to step down, but then is challenged by losing a friend and reclaims respect"", this film goes a different direction. The direction by John G. Avildsen (the same director of Rocky (1976)) here is more family oriented, which to be honest is what made Rocky (1976) so compelling. Sure the sports aspect was fun too but it was the human storytelling that worked best. The concept of having Rocky deal with a less publicized life and starting back where he came from is fine. The problems start when Rocky begins focusing more on Tommy Gunn than his own son played by Sage Stallone. Of course events like these do happen in real life but these kinds of moments aren't the changes fans want to see in the main protagonist. It's careless and makes Rocky look like a clueless father. Even with this though because the original human characters are of more importance, it is better to see a different focus. Although there have been plenty of persistent antagonists before that Rocky has come up against, Richard Grant is by far the man who chews up the most scenery in the series. This man has one the most hammiest performances; talking extremely fast without stopping and continuously showing his teeth to the camera. He isn't a likable character but he is fun to watch. The Tommy Gunn character is fleshed out but unfortunately turns from sympathetic to unsympathetic over time. Here's what's going to turn off people for those who enjoyed the first four films. The biggest change audiences will see is the amount of boxing involved. Believe it or not there are scenes that have boxing in it - but none of them involve Rocky in the ring. The matches still entertain and pack enough energy to keep it lively but of course for anyone looking to see Rocky fight, will be disappointed either way.Another disappointment belongs to the director of photography. Instead of long time camera operator Bill Butler shooting for the production, this time Steven Poster took over. For Poster's work it's not that it was unwatchable or unsteady but it did not have the same feel as Butler's. For the last four films, Bill Butler's work contains numerous wide shots of urban and rural terrain and also concentrated on what was of importance for each installment. Here, Poster just feels like he's shooting because it's his job. There's no aspect to his shots that feel noteworthy of mentioning. Finally, the biggest blow was the music composed by returning veteran Bill Conti who scored every entry except Rocky IV (1985). Conti doesn't change anything, which is good but at the same time doesn't add anything other than updating the themes a tad by adding in a saxophone. Every other track feels like a cut and paste of other tracks Conti had composed from the other films. That's not to say they don't work but each entry should get some kind of an addition.Its direction is focused on the human characters more than the spectacle of the sport and although all threads don't head down the right path, they at least develop the original characters differently. Also Richard Grant as the antagonist is one hammy actor. But for those who are looking for the engaging boxing matches with Rocky involved, they will be ripped off. That and the music and cinematography are nothing special to mention either this time.",Rocky V
54,Sandcooler,Rocky takes the Mickey role,6,11 March 2011,"This part of the ""Rocky""-series tries to go back to basics, and hell it almost works. They even rehired original director John G. Avildsen, A for effort. However, some things just kinda bring this movie down. First of all, you have the fact that Avildsen isn't really that great. The entries that Stallone directed had just as much visual flair (if not more), so what's really the point of hiring an outside guy again? Furthermore, the plot to this movie seems crummy. Rocky suddenly just loses all his money, when what now? Yeah yeah Paulie accidentally signed something yadda yadda yadda more vague movie reasons, on with the show. Back to his old neighbourhood he goes, whatever works. Then you have the new characters, who are just really bland. Tommy Gunn is by far the most boring boxer in the entire franchise, and Duke (not the same ""Duke"" from the previous ones mind you, was it really that hard to come up with some different name?) is such a cardboard villain you think you're watching a kid's movie. However, this shouldn't suggest there's nothing good about this movie. The bits with Rocky's son actually work well this time around, even though Sage Stallone can't really act. I'm also quite glad Talia Shire finally gets something to do besides looking worried for 90 minutes. Here it's just 80 minutes of looking worried and some good emotional speeches. ""Rocky V"" will probably always be the black sheep of the family, but it still has its merits.",Rocky V
55,gangstahippie,Worst one but still not bad,7,1 July 2007,"Rated PG-13 for Violence and Language.Rocky 5 is the fourth sequel in the Rocky series and was thought to be the last one until Rocky Balboa.I think its good that Stallone made Rocky Balboa because that was a much better conclusion than this movie.This is the worst Rocky film in the series.But that does not mean it is bad.Sure some parts of the storyline are hard to believe but I thought the parts where Rocky tries to connect with his son were fairly good.Also the part where he reminisces while walking through Mickey's old gym was a good scene.This may be the worst Rocky but it is still an okay film.In this film, Rocky loses all his money and gets brain damage from his previous fight with Ivan Drago(from Rocky IV) so he cannot fight anymore and he is back in his old neighborhood.What's weird about this movie is that this takes place right after Rocky IV but in Rocky IV, his son was around 5 years old.In this one he is a teenager.Anyway now Rocky decides to train a younger fighter named Tommy Gunn.However there is this boxing promoter(modeled after Don King) who tries to steer Tommy away from Rocky by saying that Tommy is just living under Rocky's shadow.Also while Rocky trains this new man,he neglects his son who becomes a punk.In the end, Rocky and Tommy get into a street fight.Rocky V may be the worst Rocky in the series but it is still an alright movie.",Rocky V
56,MR_Heraclius,Rocky,7,13 February 2020,Stallone trades in the ambiance of a big-fight atmosphere for senseless street-fighting. Rocky V is an unacceptable installment that tarnishes the already back-down-on-his-luck fighter. The uninspiring acting and street-smart vibe is just as damaging as the fighter's brain in this film. But though the film has some significant damages it still manages to be somewhat uplifting with the lack of magic it possessed.,Rocky V
57,Howlin Wolf,"This one wasn't NEARLY as bad as I'd feared, but a 6th would be beyond the pale...",6,21 February 2005,"... He already tried to pass the torch over, and even a stalwart like Rocky's gotta stop punching above his weight sometime. Just because ""Tommy Gunn"" is an unbelievably cack name, doesn't mark this as a total washout, though! Maybe series fans yearned to see Rocky back in the ring, but credit Stallone for trying to go in a different direction. One particular chap making the mistake of complaining about a payoff line is WAY off-base; ""Sue me for what?!"" - Well, 'assault', yes; but this completely ignores the relevant point that at this stage there is virtually nothing left of the Balboa estate that is worth going after! This is a film that I believe to be much maligned, as it seems to be very much in keeping with the rest of the series, and serves both as a competent progression and a fitting swansong. However, my words about the prospect of another installment: ""Time's up on this last round, Rock - I just heard the bell!""",Rocky V
58,baumer,A terrible way to end the series,4,2 June 2000,"Stallone thought he had it all figured out.  His films were failing at the box office so he would go back to his bread and butter and write a sequel where he becomes Rocky from 1976.  He makes Rocky old and fragile.  He makes him broke.  He sends him back to the streets of Philadelphia.  He gives him the same clothes and even gives him his hat back.  The fans should love this.What a stupid idea!The problem with that notion is that Rocky grew into what he was.  He started out with humble beginnings and he worked his way up into super-stardom.  He got in better shape, he increased his wealth, he became the world champ.  You can't take all that back and have Rocky go back to what he once was.  It just doesn't work.  I want to see him in the ring and fight.  I want to see him take on all the larger than life people with eccentric personalities like Mr. T and Dolph.  But instead we have a squalid Rocky, an impoverished one that is merely a pastiche of what he once was. And that just doesn't work.  Once you build a character from scratch and make him larger that life, you cannot regress him and then have him fight in the streets.  He has to be in the ring.  He just has to be.I love the Rocky films.  They were inspirational and they were fun.  But this is a weak effort and it did not have his true fans in mind when he made this mess!4 out of 10",Rocky V
59,emasterslake,The fall of the champ.,7,20 December 2006,"After defeating the lethal Ivan Drago, Rocky has suffered some of the injuries he's received but figured it's nothing. So he heads back home to America to be welcomed as a big hero for the U.S. The press asks if he'll fight again, and a Boxing Manager name George Washington Duke offers Rocky an endless opportunity, but Rocky didn't give a straight answer to either one of those, as Adrian insisted that he's planning to retire, and got him out of there before any hesitation. Sometime later at Balboa Manor, Adrian finds out that Paulie gave their loan to a fake banker deal without realizing it. They went to the bank to try to straighten it out but, it was already too late. All the money Rocky has made was gone.Rocky figures that if he fights again, he could win back what was lost. But Adrian tells Rocky, he must see a doctor on his condition. And after a brain scan, it turns out that Rocky has developed some brain damage. The effects are irreversible and will get worse if he fought again. Rocky didn't want to admit it being true, but for Adrain's sake, he's forced to retire. And the Manor was sold. Rocky, Adrian, and Rocky Jr. moved to Paulie's home to live in. Rocky is back to being the worthless bum he was from the start. He decides to reopen Mick's Boxing Ring and become a trainer like Mick himself. Meanwhile Washington Duke does all he could to get Rocky to agree with him to fight for him. But none worked, as Adrain would be there to defend Rocky's condition.Tommy Gun, a young boxer has traveled all the way from Oklahoma to meet Rocky. And would like to learn more about his boxing moves. Rocky didn't know anything about professional managing but gave it a shot. And soon finds himself a new student to be taught about boxing. They soon became brothers, but little does Rocky know is that he's spending more time with his student than his family. Including his own son, who is losing faith in him.This fifth installment to the Underdog story, isn't as bad as I've it was. Only reason why it's receive negative reviews is cause it's Rocky's down fall in boxing. Things might seem bad at first, but it does become satisfying by the very end. And the climax fight is one of the best parts. The Rocky fans might not like this one, but it's still a Rocky movie to see every now and then for my perspective. It'll be cool to see Rocky come back in the ring in the latest and final chapter: ""Rocky Balboa"".",Rocky V
60,fmarkland32,Punching bag...,5,2 August 2006,"Sylvester Stallone returns for his fifth go around as Rocky, this time he is brain damaged due to the fight with Ivan Drago and he has lost all of his money thanks to a crooked lawyer and so he is forced to return to his roots where he understandably wonders why he lost everything he worked so hard to gain. Along the way he trains a new fighter named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) who represents Rocky's chance to regain some honor until of course a promoter steals Gunn away and turns him against Rocky which then leads to a street fight. Rocky V if anything else is at least better than the abomination that was Rocky IV, this one is a little more downbeat and depressing as Stallone regains his honor but none of the wealth he throughly deserved. My whole opinion on why Rocky V is rated so low is because it basically puts one of the most likable characters into such a sad situation which nobody wants to see. Rocky V despite what anyone wants to say does have it's share of slow moments but the training montage as well as the final fight sequence works in at least establishing this as a guilty pleasure. The acting is far better in this entry (The Razzies have a prejudice against Sly Stallone) and really it is at least a watchable entry. Although truth be told the trailer made this seem far better than it was in theaters. Also Rocky V is fairly clichéd and generally predictable and lacking in a serious villain. Plus Tony Burton and Burgess Meredith are wasted as they are barely in the movie. Although Meredith provides the best moments of heart in the entire movie. I refuse to give into the notion that this is the worst sequel because Rocky IV was far duller. Plus the final fight sequence is pretty exciting.* * out of 4-(Fair)",Rocky V

62,ivo-cobra8,One of the worst Rocky movies ever made!,1,6 November 2015,"Rocky V is definitely one of the worst Sport Drama movies I ever saw in the series. It is not even a sport film to me! It is a sad satire story! What the hell happened in here? Rocky IV was such a Entraining Action sport film, this is a disaster and over long boring train wreck! It is just not the Rocky we grew up with it. This movie can't compare to the past Rocky movies. It seems to take everything Rocky worked hard for and throw it out the window. He loses all his money and he also seems to forget he has a son, even though that was a big event in Rocky II. Also, why is his son like 10 years older that he was in Rocky IV, wasn't Rocky only gone for a few months. Rocky quitting boxing, he suffered from brain damage I just hate that. Again I also had a major problem with Adrian's character. The same that I was angry on her in Rocky II for not been supportive, here is she even worse than ever! She was a completely different person and her chemistry with Rocky did not show in this movie. In Rocky V she suddenly becomes very assertive, even when dealing with the press and in public situations. This is totally contrary to the reserved, shy character we had known previously. I think this change in character was a big reason the chemistry between her and Rocky did not work.Then we get to Rocky V, and find that because of his incredibly stupid brother in law, Rocky ends up completely broke and destitute, ending right back where he started in his old neighborhood. As if it were all for nothing. Who really wants to see a study of a hero's fall into depravity? I don't. Ending the series at Rocky IV would have been the best decision. The things I liked in the movie was the opening scene, showing his match from Rocky IV and shows him in the Russia Moscow still showering and than he can't stop shaking his hands. I love the Rocky, Paulie attending press conference. I love that Rocky moves to a working-class Philadelphia neighborhood where he grew up as child. I love how Rocky Balboa Jr. fights off of two bullies and starts training by uncle Paulie I love that. Until he face them and fight's back, I love that scene. I love Elisebeth Peters as Jewel, Robert's Girlfriend she was so beautiful in the film. What happened to the actress who played Jewel where did she went?. I think the script and the changes of the fifth installment just really hurt the film so much. It is just a poor sad story of a depressed Drama that is just not Rocky! Anyway, I don't want to write anymore and leaving any more spoilers in here, and I don't want to insult the film, because I love Rocky. One last thing: even Sylvester Stallone agrees that film is awful, the producers even wanted to kill the Rocky character off. Sly was very disappointed with the film's release and he waited 16. years until he made a successful sequel Rocky Balboa a big improvement over Rocky V. The rating is 4/10 because it did had some moments. It is a shame that two actors died who played in this movie: Sage Stallone Sly's son and Tommy Morrison who played Tommy 'Machine' Gunn both died separately and they are both missed. R.I.P. ! Rocky V is a 1990 American sports drama film.

63,fernandoschiavi,"Rocky V is not among the best films in the franchise, however it rescues the development of the characters and brings the melancholy atmosphere and the human facet",5,3 October 2020,"Rocky V was an attempt to return to the origins of the great Philadelphia fighter, Rocky Balboa. Five years after the release of the last issue of the series, which by the way was the one that collected the most at the American and worldwide box offices, Stallone promoted yet another fight for the career of his most famous character. But they did not warn the star that the public and critics would not approve the result of the feature, being released as the definitive ending for the story and characters.
In this fifth episode of the franchise, Stallone's script seeks to bring a certain novelty, completely changing the focus of the narrative and addressing others who are part of the boxing show business and who had not been previously addressed in the franchise, but misses when taking the lead Rocky. In 1990, there was not much that Rocky Balboa could do. He had fought Apollo Creed twice, trained with the former opponent, faced the fierce Mr. T and practically ended the Cold War with his own fists by defeating Ivan Drago in the Soviet Union. For Balboa's fifth theatrical appearance, Sylvester Stallone turned to his old friend John G. Avildsen, who started it all by directing the first Rocky.After all these events mentioned above, it is more than understandable that Rocky starts the movie by announcing (again) his retirement from boxing. In the first four films in the Rocky franchise, the fighter played by Sylvester Stallone was seen as a potential champion, from his amateur phase in the first two productions, to the professionalization of the third and fourth films. Now, the novelty is no longer the opponent or the scenario in which the battle takes place, but the theme of the franchise: the fifth film decides to debate the issue of the transmission of knowledge between generations, as Rocky ages and retires. This chapter significantly transforms the saga. Before, the goal was victory or personal overcoming (of Rocky, of Apollo), now, history questions the impact of people on each other. This is probably the most psychologically complex film, but also the novelist, in the worst sense of the word, which ends up confusing the boxer's realistic melancholy in the first film with pure cheap drama.A sudden turn of events is created about the loss of money: suddenly, the rich fighter suffers a financial blow, being forced to return to the old house with his beloved Adrian (Talia Shire), his son (Sage Stallone) and his brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young). It may be an unconvincing change in narrative terms, but it's great for the dynamics of Rocky as a whole. The return of John G. Avildsen to the direction is a decision made especially by the different moments that seek to honor ""Rocky"", building a nostalgic atmosphere that certainly finds echo in the feelings of the fans. Rocky V takes on the clear mission of evaluating the character's entire journey as if the boxer were on the couch. Following a good part of the classic narrative structure of the franchise (the beginning recalls the previous film, we have a fight at the end, etc.), ""Rocky V"" also bets on the return of the melancholic tone when bringing the protagonist facing health and financial problems, returning to a difficult life and, mainly, noting the passage of time and the decay of important places for him, like Mickey's abandoned academy, so while Steven Poster's photography direction helps to create this atmosphere through the choice of dark colors and gloomy environments, John G. Avildsen takes the opportunity to also insert the mentioned nostalgia, rescuing several elements of the first film that establish an immediate connection with the most nostalgic viewer, as when Rocky puts his black hat and glasses on Adrian.
Confirming this strategy, Bill Conti's soundtrack also recalls ""Rocky, a Fighter"" by bringing the song ""Tack it back"", the slow chords of the classic theme song that pack his memories of his early career, among other moments. On the other hand, in ""Rocky V"" we don't have the famous training sequence accompanied by the exciting soundtrack present in the other films in the franchise. In fact, the soundtrack appears only occasionally, contradicting the presence so marked previously. Perhaps the excess of clips in ""Rocky IV"" motivated the choice of an economical soundtrack in ""Rocky V"".Unfortunately, the script ends up slipping at several unconvincing moments. First, the explanation for the loss of fortune is extremely forced and nothing justifies anyone looking for it to invest in advertising. Stallone realized that he should bring that naive air back to his series, showing a character of strange wits and conversations, as well as his little advanced intelligence. This was the original Rocky. Melancholic, emotional, tough and charismatic and not just a war cannon, as was being shown in the third and fourth parts of the series. One of the problems of this film is precisely its forced characterization, considering that the central characters completely change their personality, returning to the one explored in the first films, losing everything they conquered and acquired over the other films.Stallone shows the weight of age well in the expressions of pain that accompany him, making Rocky even more fallible and human. In addition, his affectionate relationship with his son reinforces his charisma, especially when he realizes his joy at reliving stages of life through the boy, in simply beautiful moments. Even when he's nervous, Rocky doesn't lose his humanity and his good heart, as is clear from his first dialogues with Tommy. Not even the media and its voracity for controversial news can take him seriously. However, the possibility of reliving the adrenaline of boxing and being able to play the role of Mickey excites Rocky, who finds himself in that young boxer - or at least tries to see in that boy's struggle his struggle to find a place in the sun. So the disappointment is even greater when Tommy leaves him behind to take the easy way. At the same time, he neglects his biological son, who has no vocation for sport.This turning point in the script is extremely predictable. We imagined long before Tommy will leave Rocky and give in to the harassment of the greedy businessman experienced by Richard Gant through signs that are not as subtle as the family conflict that his arrival causes - and, mainly, because of the performance of Tommy Morrison. Contrary to what we might imagine, Rocky starts to ignore his own son and wife (Talia Shire, in his farewell to the series) and to focus his life only on Tommy, in an attitude that he certainly would not have and that disagrees with the human character that we knew until then. The relationship between father and son (Rocky and Robert) changes suddenly. And later on it is resolved as if in an act of magic. In addition, Stallone's character returns to his naive and funny personality. Like much in the film, there is no time for events to unfold. Without nuances or details, the whole results without a more elaborate construction. And that is a fatal mistake. Add to this the son's natural revolt, the businessman's sneaky approach and the young fighter's evident ambition and we have the recipe ready for the change of character.Equally predictable is the confrontation between them, which obviously appears in the final act, but at least it rescues the energy that was lacking in the confrontation with Drago in ""Rocky IV"", still bringing an air of novelty precisely because it happens on the streets, in an almost primitive way. Keeping the camera agitated and close to the characters' faces, Avildsen manages to create the desired atmosphere without making us lose the geographical notion of what we see on the screen, which is very important. The confrontation is raw, full of repressed feelings that are thrown out and, therefore, it works. The expected outcome with Rocky's victory and his reconciliation with his family only confirm the idea of ending his film career in a simple but dignified way. Rocky V is so committed to regaining the amateur and raw aspect of the sport that he leaves the sporting scene, almost mandatory in a boxing film. The long-awaited fight represents the overcoming of the Oedipus complex: Tommy is forced to symbolically attack his father to become independent. On the one hand, this is the most important fight in the saga, because it pits the creator against the creature, as if Rocky were fighting against himself, younger.About 20 years after the film's release, Stallone said Rocky V, who he said was the biggest mistake of his career and only agreed to make the film out of greed. ""I'm very greedy. What else can I say? Rocky V was a big mistake, because the audience didn't want to see the character's decay. They wanted to remember Rocky at his best, and I should have thought about it. I think the movie ended for being more comical, ""said the actor in an interview. In fact, Rocky V is not among the best films in the series, along with the fourth episode, however it rescues some important aspects by returning to focus on the development of the characters and by bringing the melancholy atmosphere and the human facet so present in the best moments of the franchise. It was conceived as a golden key to the franchise starring Sylvester Stallone. In addition to the narrative seeking to complete the character's story arc, the final credits pay tribute to the previous works and all those who were part of Rocky Balboa's life in some way. If he had ended up here, he would have been honest - after all, Stallone did not imagine at that time that Rocky would return 16 years later with the great ""Rocky Balboa"". I'm glad he gave up on the idea.",Rocky V
64,Ruskington,Another tired sequel but still watchable,5,13 April 2020,"After the debacle of Rocky IV, expectations were not high for this final instalment. However, despite its generally poor reception, I don't mind this movie all that much.There is certainly a bit of a change up in the plot with the introduction of Rocky Jr as a more prominent character and with Rocky taking on a coaching role. The late Sage Stallone does a solid job as Rocky Jr and his 'beat the bullies' story arc is reasonably engaging. Sly Stallone and Tommy Morrison however, are atrocious throughout this film and don't even seem like they really care about this tired plot. Tommy Gunn is comfortably the worst villain in all the Rocky movies and Morrison was a very poor casting choice.But despite all this, Rocky V is reasonably entertaining. Richard Grant is hilarious and the production and music are as good as ever. Not a great way to round things up but not a total flop either.",Rocky V
65,Falconeer,Rocky Redeemed,8,24 July 2019,"After the embarrassing trash-fest that was ""Rocky IV,"" which was a sledgehammer that destroyed a franchise known for having the perfect balance of action and drama, by morphing the characters into cartoons...we get a return to form. ""Rocky V"" seems to be an apology for that veering off course, by bringing back the raw emotion that made the world love these iconic characters. Slammed for being ""depressing,"" even though life can be depressing, and no matter how high a person climbs, they can always fall back into the sludge that they crawled out of. I'm guessing people didn't want to think about that, or anything, while watching something that must have looked like a throwback in 1990.
Returning to his Philly roots after losing his fortune, (by way of a far-fetched plot device but it's a MOVIE and it was necessary to tell the story it wanted to tell), Rocky and Adrian must rebuild their lives from zero. Having grown up in privileged wealth, Rocky's son, (played by Stallone's real-life son, Sage) doesn't adjust too well to life in a rough Philly slum. The kid needs to develop a thick skin when confronted by a jealous bully at school, and the fact that his dad is wrapped up in reliving his old dreams, by training the next big boxing champ, doesn't help his son cope. This is basically a father/son relationship story, and it wasn't what the ""Rocky IV"" crowd wanted. But those who remember the original, were mostly happy to see a return to reality. And maybe the film makers were aware that more people could relate to hard times and poverty than mansions and Maserati's, but looking at some of the criticisms here, they overestimated the intelligence of Rocky fans. Seeing the ""old neighborhood"" is such a nostalgia trip for those who grew up watching ""Rocky"" and ""Rocky II"" that any flaws can be forgiven. Seeing Mickey return in those emotionally charged dream sequences was another high point, as was seeing Sly acting with his real-life son, who was really good in the role. In the end, the message behind ""Rocky V"" is a simple one, that family is more important than wealth and fame. The movie's final fight did not take place in some big boxing ring with lights and celebrities, but rather in a dirty Philadelphia street, with Rocky in a brutal, bare knuckles street brawl with his nemesis, Tommy ""Machine Gunn"" Morrison, the up and comer that turned on him after being trained by the champ and then selling out to the sleazy world of professional boxing, which is exposed here in a very honest way. The fight is raw, and as hard as that brawl with Clubber Lang in the also excellent ""Rocky III,"" only this time it takes place in the real world. Why so many people didn't like this movie is an absolute mystery to me.",Rocky V
66,Vivekmaru45,"This Truly Speaking, Is The Best In The Rocky Series.",10,8 December 2010,"What's up with the negative reviews. If you saw all the other ones 1,2,3,4 and then think deeply about it, this ones the best, because it shows us the never before seen side of Rocky's life.He is growing old and he must accept that fact. He thinks often of his past in the film. We see the sort of relationship he has with his son (played by his real son Sage Stallone). And this time for once in his life he listens to what Adrian has to say. After the fight in U.S.S.R. Rocky, Adrian, and Adrian's brother Paulie return from to their lavish Philadelphia home to find out that Paulie had Rocky unknowingly sign 'power of attorney' over to Balboa's accountant, who had, in turn, squandered all of Rocky's money on bad business deals and disappeared.He quits from the professional boxing scene due to an injury he suffered in the match against Drago, despite his grim financial situation. Rocky is humiliatingly forced to sell his house and watch all of his expensive belongings be auctioned off to the highest bidder. The only thing Rocky doesn't lose is Mickey's gym, which Mickey had willed to Rocky's son, Robert. We see him cry as he remembers the time spent training with Mick. It is really heartfelt. The old gym in which he used to train with Mick now becomes his only source of income and the only purpose of his life.Rocky's son is exposed for the first time to poverty. He is savagely bullied at school for the first time, but he perseveres and overcomes this. He does not get enough attention from his father and this creates a rift. Tommy Morrison plays the role of an ambitious boxer wanting to be trained by the legendary Rocky Balboa. He sweet-talks his way into Rocky's heart. As Rocky cannot box due to the injury he sustained to the head during the fight with Drago, he sees the success of Tommy as himself being back in the ring. Enter the ruthless boxing promoter: a parody of Don King. He calls himself George Washington Duke, and he has a catch phrase ""Only in America."" Duke tries (unsuccessfully) to arrange a boxing match between the current heavyweight champion Eugene Cain and Rocky in Tokyo. Adrian promptly intervenes and puts a stop to this.Once again Duke tries to tempt Rocky. Rocky now wants to lift his family back up to a lavish life, but Adrian again comes to save him in the nick of time. Tommy's impressive rise through the ranks catches the eye of Duke, who uses the promise of a title shot against Cane and Tommy's own resentment at being compared to his trainer to lure him away from Rocky. Duke pulls up outside the Balboa house with Tommy in tow, who has now been deceived into thinking that Rocky doesn't have his best interests in mind. When Rocky tries to convince his friend otherwise, an ungrateful Tommy drives off in a huff, leaving Rocky for good.Tommy wins the heavyweight title by knocking out Union Cane in the first round, but is booed by spectators throughout the fight and hounded by reporters afterward. They insist that Cane was nothing but a ""paper champion"", because Cane didn't win the title from Balboa. Therefore, the public would never consider Tommy the real champion unless he fights a worthy opponent. With Tommy enraged by the press's reaction, Duke, sensing an opportunity, tells Tommy that he needs to fight Rocky man to man, and settle once and for all who is the best.Duke and Tommy show up at a local bar to goad Rocky into accepting a fight; Rocky initially declines but after Tommy hits Paulie, Rocky agrees, but instead challenges Tommy to a street fight on the spot. Despite Duke's warnings to keep the fight in the ring, Tommy accepts the challenge.Despite gaining the upper hand early in the fight, Rocky is eventually beaten down by Tommy and is seemingly out for the count. His head once again pounds with hellish visions of the fight with Drago and Mickey's funeral. He then hears his old mentor's voice urging him to get back in the fight, to go just ""one more round"". Rocky gets back up and, with his family and the entire neighborhood cheering him on, utilizes his vast street fighting knowledge to defeat Tommy, knocking him into the grill of a bus with his final blow. After the fight, Duke commends Rocky and tries to appeal to him, but Rocky has heard enough. Duke threatens to sue if Rocky touches him, but after a brief hesitation, Rocky punches him in the gut anyway, knocking him onto the hood of a car. The crowd cheers as the bankrupt Rocky shrugs and quips, ""Sue me for what?"". Superb acting by Sage Stallone, also a special appearance by Oliver Burgess Meredith was very moving. Richard Gant is phenomenal as the boxing promoter George Washington Duke. Tommy Morrison puts in a convincing performance as Rocky's hot prospect Tommy Gunn. Burt Young is superb as always playing his familiar role as Paulie.Buy this superb film directed by none other than the legendary John G. Avildsen.

67,Maziun,"People love comebacks ? Well , not always",3,16 November 2013,"The idea of making a fifth movie about Rocky Balboa was very risky. The story was already getting thin with third movie and the forth one is watchable only when you don't take it seriously. This fifth movie reunites Stallone and John Avildsen (The director of original ""Rocky"") together for the first time since 14 years . After the over the top ""Rocky 4"" this one was supposed to be a back to the roots. A serious drama.Unfortunately this movie is a failure. The direction of Avildsen is very cheesy at places (Rocky remembering Mick , the hip hop soundtrack , pathos in the final fight). Most of the problems come from the screenplay. The characters of Rocky , Paulie and Adrian haven't really changed and to watch for the fifth time the same characters acting the same way is just annoying. Not to mention that Stallone . Young and Shire overact in their dramatic scenes here. And ""Rocky 5"" does feel similar at times to ""Rocky 2"" (the money problems , becoming an ordinary person once again).The story on paper looks good , but as a movie it's a cheap morality story about loyalty, greed and father-son relationship. The screenplay isn't subtle with dealing of all those things. It's hard to believe that Rocky would forget about his son so easily and gave everything to Tommy. Sure , I understand why he did it (because he was in that way still fighting on the ring) , but it feels just too convenient. Same goes for his conflict wit Tommy . The whole potential is killed by sappiness and morality preaching. Not to mention the black and white morality. Tommy Gunn is one-dimensional asshole through all the movie . He could be a tragic figure (he's got a troubled past) , but the one dinner talk is just too little . The boxing manager George Duke is also annoyingly one-dimensional villain.The good things are the funny dialogues and as always the music by Bill Conti. Also , the fight scenes are done well and the movie isn't boring. All in all it's just too little to save this unwanted and unnecessary sequel . Thankfully , ""Rocky Balboa"" was a great farewell to Rocky. I give it 3/10.",Rocky V

This time, Rocky is set to train his son his secrets on boxing so that his son is able to defend himself. Rocky goes from being an absent father to one who plays an important part of his son's life, much to the unhappiness of his wife, and this draws a rift in the family. This is certainly the one 'Rocky' story to miss. The story is dull, and it is not as engaging as the others. It is mainly a soap opera between Rocky and his family, and the son is the star of the film; it is a film about him and not so much about Rocky. I would give this one a miss.

69,tonypeacock-1,Descends into farce. A sad entry in the franchise.,4,25 April 2020,"I've heard things about this film before viewing but I decided to view it with a clear mind and no misconceptions.Director duties pass back to original Rocky director John G. Avildsen.
Indeed the screenplay at the start of the film has potential.Watching the franchise in sequence I noticed some continuity issues in the first twenty minutes.
Rocky's mansion is noticeably different from his residence in parts III and IV.The story follows an aging Rocky, brain damaged from his bruising bout with Ivan Drago on part IV.
The Balboas also face financial ruin due to their estate being signed over by brother in law Paulie (how) to an accountant who makes a poor decision on the stock market.Rocky must return to his roots in Philadelphia from part I where he relaunched his only asset. Mickey Goldmill's boxing gym.He discovers a promising young boxer, Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison - a distant relative of John Wayne) whilst inadvertently neglecting his own troubled son, Rocky Jr. (Sage Stallone).Meanwhile a Don King like promoter George Duke (Richard Gant) 'steals' the non-contracted Gunn from Rocky's management promising a title shot.Gunn isn't as commercially popular as Rocky and Duke encourages Gunn to try and fight Rocky.
Rocky is reluctant because of his health problems much to Gunn's anger leading to the infamous street fight.The film descends into a Cannon Films like 1980s farce with a street fight, yes a street fight between Rocky and Tommy Gunn.The soundtrack was one of the highlights of part IV. What happened here. Not memorable at all except a montage from previous Rocky films over the end credits.I can quite honestly say this is by far the weakest in the franchise, comparable to Superman IV and Jaws IV.",Rocky V
70,esteban1747,The last Rocky film but not the worst,6,2 May 2003,"The serial of Rocky films has been interesting at its beginning and boring after the second film. All films have tried to demonstrate the power of a white Italo-American boxer, generous, kind with his wife, son and friends. But this Rocky V reminded me part of the sad story of one of the most famous all-time boxers, Joe Louis, who had to come back to the ring to fight against a young and strong Rocky Marciano. At that time Louis was far to be the one who was unbeatable during the 40s, he came back because suddenly debts were coming to him, nobody knows how, and he was simply compelled to fight for his survival. Everybody of that generation in US knows that Louis was simply killed in life for giving the championship ""sensationally"" to white Marciano. So nearly the same is what happened to Rocky in his end as a professional boxer, and he had to train a young and strong fighter who had no ethics and no human feelings. Unfortunately, life is like that. In this film there is also a very terrible manager, George Washington Duke, played by Richard Gant, who reminds me the person of Don King. The latter is well known because of his fight arrangements and other ""movements"" in the boxing area. Therefore I saw the film arranged with some pieces of true story of another great boxer (Joe Louis) as well as the problems of dirtiness of this professional sport, which should be prohibited one day in the future for ever.",Rocky V

But there is an undeniable charm and back to basics feel to it.First film since Rocky 2 where Rocky isn't ultra rich (he loses his money in a ridiculous way, but that doesn't matter it's a film) and back on the streets. Sage Stallone (Sylvester's real son) plays Rocky Jr in this and he does a pretty good job, Tommy Morrison, a real life boxer who held the WBO heavyweight world championship belt in 1993 plays Tommy Gunn, Rocky's new protegee. He's not the best actor in the world but he does a fine job portraying Gunn, especially since this was his only big role ever.What makes this film so unique in the Rocky saga is how it goes back to basics but actually tries to have a plot, unlike 3 and 4 where the plots where not great this has a good plot, I won't spoil much but Duke is a good villain and is very greedy, something Rocky isn't.There's not as much fighting in this one as in the others, and thankfully not as many drawn out montages like in Rocky 4 but the end fight is one of the most emotional in the series, and is a street fight so obviously is quite different to normal.7/10: The odd one out in the Rocky saga, but it's actually quite good and one of the better sequels.

dirJohn G. Avildsen
eluctantly retired from boxing, and back from riches to rags, 
Rocky takes on a new protege who betrays him, as the champ's son must adjust to his family's new life after bankruptcy
Rocky Balboa is forced to retire after having permanent damage inflicted on him in the ring by the Russian boxer Ivan Drago.
 Returning home after the Drago bout, Balboa discovers that the fortune that he had acquired as 
heavyweight champ has been stolen and lost on the stockmarket by his accountant. His boxing days over, Rocky begins to coach an up-and-coming fighter named Tommy Gunn.
 Rocky cannot compete, however, with the high salaraies and glittering prizes being offered to Gunn by other managers in town.
Sometimes it gets annoying to me how critical people are of the Rocky series. It's like they feel like they have to say terrible things about it, probably because people can be so negative 
that they can't find it in themselves to believe that a 'less than intelligent' person with heart, drive and passion can move mountains and achieve success. I personally thought this, and every other Rocky movie, was fabulous. I thought Sage Stallone was amazing in his debut as Rocky's son.
 Also, this movie showed a more real side of boxing, the business side, with exploitative agents and corrupt business tactics. Some may think the Rocky series is an unrealistic saga, but Rocky IV proves it isn't. The person we saw struggle, fight, and grow rich is now back to square one..

75,caa821,Continued the decline,4,19 November 2006,"Like many others, I became a complete fan of the ""Rocky"" saga from original film on. All who have followed boxing know that the original was inspired by the New Jersey club fighter, Chuck Wepner, who fought the great Muhammad Ali and knocked the champion down. However, Wepner was also known as the ""Bayonne Bleeder,"" because of the amount of punches he absorbed, with his propensity to cut easily.The original took this a step further, made the fight a ""split decision,"" and ""II"" portrayed Rocky's successful rematch with the ""Ali"" figure, Carl Weathers' Apollo Creed. After losing the title and regaining it from Mr. T in ""III,"" number ""IV"" turned pretty ludicrous. The death of Creed at the hands of the Soviet ""super-human"" indicated a lack of information and forethought on the part of those involved, even in the more secretive Cold War period. And Rocky's training on the Russian steppes in the dead of winter, and the whole bout in Moscow were also outrageous.However, ""V"" here, in my opinion, missed the mark others have accorded it. First, even allowing for Stallone's acting style, and some intended exaggerations in the Rocky persona, it is too far beyond belief that Rocky would undergo such extreme metamorphoses as his fortunes rise and fall.In ""III,"" continuing after he won Creed's title in ""II,"" his dress, demeanor, speech, and overall sophistication, are on a level with, Pierce Brosnan wearing the $7,000 suits, in his Bond flicks. Rocky's grammar and speech patterns also seem to have improved from the original goon/dropout to those of somebody who may possess a degree from the Ivy League.But in ""V"", his financial fortunes have taken a reversal. Rock seems to believe he has no alternatives between plush living and luxuries, Saville Row tailoring, and good diction and grammar --- and looking like his clothes came from Goodwill, living in a tenement, and speaking like a street person from ""Oliver Twist,"" sans accent, or William Bendix, the Brooklyn lug in an old WW II movie.Even a modicum of consistency in the lead character should have been maintained, despite his varying circumstances.I'd give the original 10*, ""II"" 9 or 10*, ""III"" 8 to 9*, ""IV"" 4* and this one the same. From what I've heard, the new film (""Rocky Balboa""), recently shown in advance premier, to be released several weeks hence, gets well back on-track. Hope so!",Rocky V

But it doesn't stop him from coaching an up-and-coming boxer named Tommy Gunn, but when Tommy decides that Rocky isn't moving him up quickly, he soon leaves Rocky and begins his new training from Duke. Tommy wins the title he wants, but still does not gain the respect he want. He wants to take out his anger in a fight with Rocky, but as Rocky is now retired from the ring, a street fight would have to do for Tommy. A street fight which could risk Rocky's life.The fifth 'Rocky' movie, which for a while was believed to have been the last 'Rocky' film, was slightly disappointing compared to the previous four movies. Although it had a good story for it to finish on, many of the characters we had loved in the previous films were missing, as well as Rocky fighting in the ring. Rocky has his fight out on the street but it's not as fun as a boxing match or even a normal street fight. The emotional from all the characters are still here, but overall, it just lacks all the fun from the first four films. Perhaps the change of director was to blame.

81,mmallon4,Back To Where It All Began,10,24 March 2018,"Few motion pictures seem to inspire as much intense dislike as Rocky V, even to the point in which Sylvester Stallone himself gave the film a score of ""O"" on a British talk show - yes, 0/10. Come on man, can you really say Rocky V has absolutely no merit to it what so ever? Even the sitcom The Vicar of Dibley bashes Rocky V in its pilot episode; ""Four's not bad is it? There were four gospels, four horsemen of the Apocalypse, four Rocky movies until they made Rocky V, very bad movie"". As a huge fan of the Rocky movies I'll just come out and say it, I love Rocky V. Oh yeah, deal with it! Part V was designed the return the series back to its roots, not only by bringing Rocky back to his humble beginning on the streets of Philadelphia but also with the film being directed by John G. Avildsen, the director the first Rocky. In my eyes, the film succeeds in this aim.The one big grip I do have with Rocky V is how it messes up the Rocky continuity. Just to give a brief recap of said continuity from Rocky III onwards: it isn't made clear of the date in which Rocky III ends, but we are told the date of Mickey's death as taking place in 1981 so we can assume Rocky's second fight with Clubber Lang took place in 1981/82. Rocky IV picks up where Part III left off, but no dates are mentioned in the movie nor is it made clear on the passing of time. It seems most likely the events of Rocky IV take place somewhere from 1982 to 1985, the year in which the movie was released. Rocky V picks up where Rocky IV left off, and once Rocky returns to the United States from Russia and gets off the plane, he is greeted by his teenage son; however, at the end of Rocky IV he was still a child. There should have been a passing of time before the introduction of the teenage son. But on top of this, considering the early 90's aesthetic of Rocky V, due in part of its soundtrack, it seems like Rocky really did travel through time when flying on that plane from the 80's world of Rocky IV (perhaps some crazy fan theory explanation could solve the mystery such as Rocky staying in Russia for several years after his fight with Drago). While this plot hole does bother me to a degree, does it really interfere with my enjoyment of the overall movie? No, not really.Once Rocky travels through time and is back in America, the family go home to a different mansion than that seen in Rocky III and IV, but I can accept perhaps they owned more than one property. Regardless, due to an issue involving taxes, the Balboa family lose their fortune and are forced to return to return to Paulie's old place in Philadelphia. What was the tax issue? To quote IMDB's FAQ section for Rocky V:
When Rocky was in Russia during Rocky IV, Paulie gave the power of attorney to Rocky's accountant, because the accountant told Paulie he needed to authorize a tax extension. Given free access to Rocky's accounts, the accountant used Rocky's savings to finance a real estate investment, planning on having the money back in the account by the time Rocky returned from Russia. However, the real estate deal went bad and the money was never returned. Additionally, Rocky discovers that he has debt payments, mortgage payments ($400,000) and that the accountant hasn't filed any of Rocky's tax returns for over 6 years.
Ok, I'm not an expert on taxes, but the movie makes it sound convincing, so I'll buy it.Rocky's return to his old stomping ground gives the film a welcome nostalgia factor, from Rocky wearing his clothes from the first movie to Adrian being dowdy once again and working in the pet shop, to the return of locations from the first movie such as the Atomic Hoagie Shop) at one point in the film, they even repeat the very first shot of the original Rocky). Likewise, the streets of Philly appear to be more graffiti and trash-laden than they had been in 1975/76. Rocky V also features Burgess Meredith's final appearance as Mickey (even if he does look older than his last appearance in Rocky III), in a newly filmed flashback scene in which he gives one of the most powerful monologues in the series. This is ranks as one of my favourite scenes of the entire franchise, and I fail to see how anyone could deny its emotional impact.Due to Rocky's newly diagnosed brain damage, he is unable to return to the boxing ring and instead trains a new upcoming boxer Tommy Gunn (portrayed by real-life boxer Tommy Morrison); a predecessor to the plot of 2015's Creed. Tommy Gunn is nowhere near as iconic or memorable as Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang or Ivan Drago, but I still enjoy his character and find him more interesting than Mason 'The Line' Dixon in Rocky Balboa. He's an enthusiastic go-getter who eventually turns on his mentor and becomes seduced by the dark side of the boxing business. So yeah, it's a better version of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith with Rocky as Obi-Wan, Tommy as Anakin and the boxing promoter George Washington Duke as Palatine. George Washington Duke is the main villain of the movie; a Don King-like boxing promoter. I love this guy; he's such a stereotypical loud-mouthed salesman, continuing the tradition of over the top Rocky Villains. It is even implied by Duke himself that he is resentful of being the beneficiary of affirmative action (""Do people really think I'm a cheap carbon copy or a second-rate pretender who only got a shot because of my skin tone!"").However, the real heart of Rocky V lies with its father-son story and the themes of neglect and abandonment between Rocky and his son Robert, played by Stallone's real-life son, Sage Stallone; making the interactions between them feel more real and genuine. Not to mention the character of Robert has a frightening predicament of going from a sheltered life to living in a tough neighbourhood. It's weird to think that both Sage Stallone and Tommy Morrison are now both dead; two young stars from a movie which is only 26 years old. Stallone already hates Rocky V as it is, but having the movie star his deceased son I'd imagine makes the movie even more unwatchable for him. In regards to the subplot involving Robert and the school bullies, I actually find this aspect of the story to be interesting itself. I feel it showcases how in order to make peace with the bullies he had to fight them back and win the battle, and that Adrian's suggestion that she who would rather he solve his problems verbally would be a futile gesture. After Robert fights the bullies he then immediately makes peace with one of them and they become friends. Could this be a war parable, or am I just over-analysing?Despite V being the black sheep of the franchise, Rocky V still ends on a fight, not in the ring but on the street. Having Rocky take part in a barbaric street fight makes for great entertainment, due in part to the fun of seeing Rocky engage in a fight in which there are no rules. I also love all the over the top crowd reactions (""Come on dad, he took my room!"", ""You're losing everything!""). The film's final pay off is immensely satisfying in which Rocky punches George Washington Duke right into the air and onto a car; what comeuppance!Rocky V reintroduces Bill Conti's music after being absent from Rocky IV. However, the soundtrack of Rocky V is mainly comprised of hip-hop and R 'n B. I'm not a fan of hip-hop, but I do like the songs included in the film. With Go For It I get the impression they were trying to create a new Eye of the Tiger; a song which is named after a phrase which is repeated throughout the film which is central to the plot. It could never be as iconic as Eye of the Tiger, but it still gets me jamming. I also love the new version of Take You Back which gives the song an early 90's spin. All the films in the series reflect the periods in which they were made, and for Rocky V it's the early 90's. Likewise, continuing the series tradition of recapping the fight from the previous film, Rocky V presents a recap of the Rocky-Drago fight scored with the traditional Rocky music by Bill Conti rather than the Vince DiCola score from Rocky IV, which is a nice touch. The opening title with the faces of Rocky and Drago in the typography is also my favourite opening title in the series.I've heard reviewers complain Rocky V is a depressing ending to the series. It becomes clear at the conclusion of the film that Rocky learns he doesn't need wealth to be happy providing he's still got his family and his health; and eventually he chooses his family over his career, pride, and ego. This is a theme which ties in with the end credits song The Measure of a Man sung by Elton John:
""You've come full circle, now you're home, without the gold, without the chrome. And this is where you've always been, you had to lose so you could win. And rise above your troubles while you can.""I did not find Rocky V in any way undermines the optimistic nature of the series. Initially, it was scripted for Rocky to die at the end, and there is even a deleted scene which shows the character of Marie from the first movie continued to hang out with the wrong crowd. These elements would make an interesting alternative version, but for my Rocky canon, I prefer the direction they took. Plus the reintroduction of Marie in Rocky Balboa was a better path for the character, more in tune with the series' optimistic nature.The end credits of Rocky V give a retrospective of the entire series which couldn't be more perfect, plus I love the song The Measure of a Man. I don't often talk about how great the end credits of a film are, yet with all the Rocky sequels I watch the credits in their entirety. Rocky V is the black sheep of the series in terms of plot structure. We already have four movies which end with Rocky fighting an opponent in the ring, it would have been tiresome to do that a fifth time. Instead, Stallone wrote a sequel which took a chance. So yes, I love Rocky V. Got a problem with that? Then my ring's",Rocky V

Back from the medical office, Rocky and Adrian still learn that following the general power of attorney that Paulie unknowingly had Rocky sign for the benefit of their accountant, the latter abused them by stealing their finances and gambling them on the stock market. Having lost everything, materially, the Balboa-Pennino family returns to Rosehill Street in the modest neighborhoods of Philadelphia. Where the family was born, grew up, and has always been at home, without the gold, without the chrome, in the dark streets they have learned to love thanks to the bright hearts of those who live there and illuminate the darkness with their modesty and their affection.
From the corrupt accountant to the greedy businessman who wants to buy everything and everyone with complete disregard for the True Values: The Values of Abnegation, Courage, Effort, but above all The Values of the Heart and Spirit, this fifth episode is a harsh criticism of savage capitalism and its predators who corrupt and destroy everything they touch. There comes a time when castles fall, but not the Compassion, and Rocky had to learn to ""lose"" to be able to win again, with his Heart, in order to defeat those who wanted to destroy him and his Family. Now he can lose and choose, understand what he had fled, and fully grasp the measure of the man who has come full circle by going to hell and back.",Rocky V
84,TheHonestCritic,"This is the most unique of all the ""Rocky"" films. Does that make it good or bad?",10,25 October 2020,"""Rocky V"" (1990), this movie is generally overlooked by most people. I just have to ask, why? Not only is this the most unique film of the entire series, it also has the darkest storyline. Which, to be honest, makes it all the more exciting to watch! ""Rocky V"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The story is that Rocky is forced to retire from boxing due to brain damage from previous boxing matches, especially from his fight against Ivan Drago. That's certainly a different turn in the series. Five movies in, it was the perfect time for a twist like this. Rocky takes over Mickey's gym and agrees to train a boxer named Tommy Gunn. That causes Rocky's son, Robert, to fall into the wrong crowd and then eventually withdraw himself from the family. Another unique thing about the plot of this movie is that the final fight isn't a boxing match, it's a street fight. That was a neat change of pace, because it's the only film of the series without a boxing match with Rocky himself! Talk about a dilemma, the storyline keeps you invested all the way through from beginning to end, which is what a perfect plot should do. As for the acting, it's stellar as usual from all the actors and actresses. We have a couple of new characters in this film; Tommy Gunn, played by Tommy Morrison and George Washington Duke, played by Richard Gant. They play the main villains in this movie and their performances are great. Both actors really make you personally hate their characters, which results in their eventual comeuppances being all the more satisfying. Of course, Sylvester Stallone is the shining star once again. One cool thing to point out, Rocky's son is played by Sylvester Stallone's actual son, Sage Stallone (R.I.P.) in the ""Rocky"" films, with the exception of the movie, ""Rocky Balboa"" (2006). His presence adds a whole new depth of chemistry to the characters! All of the sets/locations are perfect, they set the tone for the story and also give this movie a great atmosphere. As far as special effects go, there aren't that many. But, all that are utilized are perfect and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Bill Conti is nothing short of a masterpiece. Bill Conti is one of my top 10 all-time favorite film score composers, and this soundtrack is nothing short of phenomenal. This whole film score is fantastic, my personal favorite part of the soundtrack in this movie is the music during the final fight. It never fails to give an adrenaline rush! ""Rocky V"" is such an unfairly overlooked movie. It definitely deserves more praise than it usually gets. But, I'm not a common person who mirrors someone else's opinions, I'm always honest with my reviews. ""Rocky V"" is an excellent film! I can watch it over and over again and never get bored with it. Of course, I give this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Rocky V"", what are you waiting for? Go and see it today. Or else, George Washington Duke will sue you!",Rocky V
85,PeterRoeder,Difficult movie to relate to,5,9 February 2010,"I thought some scenes in this movie are very good, but others are downright stupid, so it is a very difficult movie to evaluate. I saw Rocky Balboa (Rocky 6) when it came out, and I must say, it is not a very credible update of the father-son relationship. So this movie was a strange experience to watch but I guess it fits in pretty well with the series. I just saw number 2 yesterday, and I have seen number 3 and 4 but I do not remember them too well. Anyway, now that I have seen the whole series, I think it is quite an interesting story. However, some of the pseudo-stuff in these movies is a bit too stupid. Look forward to Rambo 5.",Rocky V
86,bluesman-20,Rocky V The measure of a man.,10,23 March 2008,"Rocky V to me is the only Rocky movie that kept the promise and the original concept of Rocky. Rocky two three and four were great films but they moved Rocky too far away from who is was Rocky V fixes that problem. At the End of Rocky 4 we see Rocky is suffering from a Brain Truma inflicted from Drago's Blows Rocky is told he can never fight again and to do so would make him a vegetable. The Heavyweight Championship Title is stripped from him and Rocky announces his retirement. At the next moment he learns that his greedy lawyer has stolen Everything and Rocky is broke. He returns back to his old neighborhood and Rocky who was left Mickey's Gym reopens it and starts training a new generation of fighters Adrian goes back to work in the pet store and Rocky Junior must go to a public school where he must fight for his respect. Everything changes when Rocky is challenged by a dishonest promoter to fight the NEW Champion Union Kane Rocky refuses, At this time Rocky meets a fighter Tommy Gunn who wants him to train and manage him. Rocky begins to get his self respect back as his fighter wins fight after fight and attracts the new Champions attention. Rocky turns down the fight saying Tommy Gunn us not ready and Tommy turns on him. He becomes the Champion and the dishonest promoter becomes his mananger and he Confronts Rocky, A incredible Street Fight ensues and the movie winds down. This one is my favourite of all the Rocky films as it shows Rocky Down but not out. This movie has been unfairly knocked around by everyone from Stallone to the critics and yet it rings so true. Just try it you'll be surprised it's not your normal Rocky film it's better.",Rocky V
87,Brian-272,Not the best of the Rocky series but not the worst. Stallone go for it make a Rocky 6 so you can have a better ending to this series than this.,6,31 March 2001,"Broke and brain damaged Rocky finds himself forced into retirement in this fifth installment only to have a triumph of heart this time not in the ring. Rocky feels in ways born again when he takes a young heavyweight prospect under his wing who no one cares about when the training of Tommy Gunn begins it is victory after victory but Rocky sees that you can't teach a young lion heart no matter how much muscle Rocky learns of the young and bitterness path that Tommy Gunn takes. Only to lead this Rocky film up to a great fight scene that being the streets something that Rocky knows a little bit about. Boy does Tommy get a piece of Rocky as the hero once again stands at the end. Rocky V is not the best of the series but not the worst because it has the action the emotions and drama that is so common to Rocky. And Burt Young and Talia Shire once again give great support to Stallone to make this good like the previous Rocky movies. It is just hard seeing Rocky in a retirement state and I never liked Tommy Morrison I know he was a professional heavyweight but his real ring life turned out to show that he had a weak chin and his Rocky character had a weak heart much similar to his ring life and his acting abilities are not much the arrogant attitude just never went well Tommy, Rocky V should have cast another boxer or actor because Tommy Morrison sure is neither. Sage Stallone fit good in this movie it proves that a father and son relationship is rocky but love and hard knocks conquers all. Listen close to the words of the song The, Measure Of A Man by Elton John played during the closing credits of Rocky V it gives a true meaning to the Rocky series and also is related to every-day people like me and many others it's just a great song with true meaning. Rumors and news continue to fly around that Sylvester Stallone will return to make a Rocky 6 I have read many entertainment reports that say it will happen. Room is left for improvement and a new start two new ideas to throw at you either Rocky 6 has Stallone to start training his son Sage into the second coming of Rocky or Stallone has his Rocky character come out of retirement and win the heavyweight title like George Foreman did. No matter what happens Rocky Balboa is a American hero forever. The Rocky series is one of the greatest of all-time!",Rocky V

Tommy after leaving Rocky got the big fights but against winnable oppositions and he got no respect to he rushes off to challenge Rocky who declines until baited into a street fight which was pretty damn good.

90,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Guilty pleasure Rocky movie of mine by Stallone / Avildsen,10,4 October 2019,"Guilty pleasure Rocky movie of mine by Stallone / Avildsen. Rocky V is not a bad Rocky movie, it is my least favorite in the Rocky movies. The movie is completely opposite what Rocky IV succeeded. It is a good movie but quality is terrible. Sly him self was very disappointed whit this movie, have gave this movie a 0/10. I don't blame him, seeing this film for the first time as a kid. I hated this film, but over the time it become quilty pleasure of mine. I like this film for a Stallone / Rocky fan I luke this film for what it is. I love Rambo: Last Blood, who come out this year so I like this movie. I love all Rocky movies. I will gave Creed II another chance I going to pick up 4K Blu-ray disc.""You're a piece of garbage. This ain't none of your business. None of my business? He spit blood for you, put you ahead of his own family. And you bring these rat bums around here? Kill his dignity? Rocko made you your shot. He's the real champ. You're just a joke. Get out of here before I break your face.""Directed was by John G. Avildsen who directed the original Rocky movie. The fifth sequel in the Rocky franchise is so bad awful film like The Karate Kid Part III. Sly wrote a script in which his character Rocky dies, but he was un happy with that decision so he decide to change the script. I watched all five Rocky's on TV in high school, (even the fifth one) I grew up with Rocky movies, my classmates loved Rocky so did I. All four Rocky movies are great, Rocky V is not near good as the first four. It is so bad that I love it, it for the saga, nostalgia. I watched this movie on VHS tape when I was in high school, it was the only Rocky movie I owned it. I always thought it is a good movie on it is own way. This movies I watched before Rocky Balboa (2006) come out.Rocky Balboa is once again dawn on his luck, because of incompetent accountant Rocky loses all his money and he falls under bankruptcy. Rocky moves to a neighborhood he grew up. Since he has no money, he opens Mick's gym and trains some new boxers. A scrupulous promotor George Washington Duke (Richard Gant) offers Rocky a match of his life, against a curernt champ Union Cane (Michael Anthony Williams). Rocky refuses the match and he retires, because after his last fight he has a brain damage and he can become a brain dead permanently. This new unknow boxer name Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) comes along and ask Rocky to train him at first Rocky refuses. Second time around he tooks Tommy under his wing trains him to become number 1 contender, but his new student get's brainwashed from Duke, he betrays his best friend, mentor and turns against him. Now Rocky has to fight one final match of his life.The good: Sylvester Stallone's performence is the only worth watching of this movie. The rest of the film is boring time waster. It is sad that Rocky stopped boxing. Street fight betwen Rocky and Tommy is really good. It is different than other four movies. It is not a boxing match it is a real street fight. Stallone and Tommy Morrison did an excellent performance. They really hit each other. I like that is a still sports movie. We see Rocky under the shower after Drago fight. Thank God we got Creed II with Dolph Lundgren reprising his role as Ivan Drago. Ivan Drago was only in archive footage so Lundgren wasn't in this movie. I like the final bell, Burgess Meredith reprise his role as Mickey in a flashbacks I love that. I love the soundtrack Go For It! (Heart and Fire!) by Joey B. Ellis. I love the training sequence between Rocky and Tommy. Elisebeth Peters as Jewel, Robert's friend was one hot sexy babe in this movie. George Washington Duke played by Richard Gant was more type of Don King and he succeeded and played the charcater well done. The first time we see Rocky smoking because in all four movies I don't remember except first movie.The bad: Talia Shire's god awful performance she stinks at acting. Adrian is awful in this movie. I hate her god awful performance. Sage Stallone's worst performance as Rocky Jr. The story is awful. I don't care seeing Rocky been a ritered boxer and a mentor to a new kid. I hate that song on the end of credits The Measure of A Man I hate that song I hate it so much!I like that Rocky fixes his relationship with his son Robert and fight's Tommy on the finale. Burt Young's performance as Paulie Is solid and excellent. It is different than the last four movies, buut I am glad we got this movie because we wouldn't got Rocky Balboa. When i watched this movie in 2000 when I was first year in high school I am really greatful that my mom was still alive that time. I am thankfull for this movie to happen. Rocky all five movies were part of my childhood and my high school years I went trough. Rocky IV Is a classic to me it is the best Rocky movie ever made. Rocky V was my second film in the Rocky movies I saw and it is a let down on many counts. This is the last time we see Talia Shire in any Rocky movie she did not return in Rocky Balboa. Rocky V is a guilty pleasure of mine I love this movie to death. Thank You Stallone for this awesome fifth Rocky sequel.R.I.P. Sage Stallone, Tommy Morrison, Burgess Meredith, Tony Burton they are all missed.",Rocky V
91,luke-a-mcgowan,"Avildsen and Stallone are always a winning combo, and Rocky V gets back to basics",7,19 February 2016,"I honestly do not understand why Rocky V isn't considered one of the best Rocky sequels. Not only that, its considered the worst even by Stallone, who chalks it up to his own greed. Rocky V is not only a beautiful film but a natural story and a refreshing change of pace to three sequels that have essentially been the same film.I only watched this film grudgingly because I had heard such bad things, but I was won over almost immediately by a beautiful exchange between Adrian and Rocky. She's his everything again, something that has been lost ever since Rocky 2, and it took John Avildsen's return to slap that back into place. Stallone's performance is by far his best in a while, probably because he's not distracted by directing anymore (something that benefited his performance in Creed as well). Avildsen provides some sweet throwback to the original Rocky with his good-hearted banter with Robert on the way to school reminiscent of his similar chat with Marie. There's some brilliant directorial choices - Adrian using a certain news article as bird litter, the use of Paulie as Robert's mentor to show the lack of a decent father figure in his life and the emotional manipulation of the audience to build towards the family rift. Rocky offhandedly passes things that should be Robert's inheritance to Tommy, to an extent that we as an audience should want to protest out loud.Stallone's screenplay is better than his one in Rocky 4, with some great themes throughout. Rocky sees himself in Tommy and gets distracted by him at the expense of his son. This is built on themes mentioned in previous Rocky films about it being the only thing Rocky is good at. Tommy Gunn and Robert Balboa are both incredibly deep characters, with their actions having such natural consequences that they feel like real people. Gunn's transformation from friend to adversary is natural even though it takes place within an hour. Rocky's casually using of family phrases with Tommy hurts us just as much as it hurts Robert. That's not to say that the execution is poor in places, but as a whole the movie really works. Stallone gets back to who Rocky is as a character in this movie, rather than just a beefy conduit for 90-minute training montages that were Rockys 2-4. Its a delight to see Talia Shire back doing things again, and she gets more to do in this movie than Rocky 3-4 put together. Her scenes with Stallone keep excelling off their unbelievable chemistry and some great writing. Burt Young pulls out the best Paulie performance yet, and his ability to see what Rocky cannot speaks volumes. I don't understand where all the Razzie nominations came from, the only one who might be worthy of one is the overacting Richard Gant as the caricature George Washington Duke.The film's climax was a pleasant surprise for me. I was thrilled they didn't try to make it into a proper bout in the ring, because that would've killed all the buildup. Unlike previous films, where the story has served the fight, here the fight serves the story that's been building for almost two hours and the payoff is incredible.",Rocky V
92,ReelCheese,Down But Not Out,8,12 February 2007,"The ROCKY series got back to its roots with this human story of the former Heavyweight champ down and out once more. The result is a much-better-than-reputed effort that, until 2006's ROCKY BALBOA, served as a fitting conclusion to the popular boxing saga.Stallone returns as the title character, so brain damaged his doctor says he can't fight no more. So he picks up a protégé in young Tommy ""Machine"" Gunn (Tommy Morrison), allowing him to vicariously relive past glory. Along the way he reconnects with his young son and learns that what really matters is family. It sounds corny in an after school special kind of way, but it not only works, it works magnificently.ROCKY V has long been called the black sheep of the series by fans (even Stallone himself), often because Rock never steps into the ring. True, this is not really a boxing movie, but boxing is never really what made the ROCKY films tick. It's always been the human angles, and for that reason, ROCKY V ranks as a solid addition to the series.",Rocky V

95,jerekra,Terrible movie from a great series.,2,26 August 2008,"Rocky Five is terrible beyond belief. You may think that I am being hard on it but no. It is quite possibly the worst movie ever made and is an embarrassment to be in with the rest of the series, all of which were great movies. But this one, no.After having defeated Drago, Rocky starts experiencing physical problems, mainly shaking beyond belief. After returning home he meets up with his son who seems to have grown by more than five years of age since the last time they saw him. Rocky holds a press conference to announce his retirement but is quickly offered an opportunity to box against a young boxer named Union Caine by a man named George Washington. Rocky says no and returns home. This is where things start to go crazy.Soon it is found out that Paulie gave some guy a blank check signed by Rocky or something and that they lost all their money. So they are forced to move back to Philadelphia. Further issues show up when it is revealed that Rocky has suffered head trauma and further boxing can seriously injure him (watching this movie could also give you head trauma).However Rocky re opens the old boxing gym since Mickey willed it over to Rocky Jr. Now living in the old neighborhood Rocky Jr. begins school and is immediately beaten up by bullies. Rocky meanwhile meets up with a young boxer named Tommy Gunn whom wants Rocky to manage him but Rocky decides he is not a good enough listener. He latter changes his mind and agrees to train Tommy Gunn and begins to spend more time with Tommy than his own son and dissension soon forms between father and son.TOmmy Gunn moves up the ranks. George Washington meanwhile tries to lure Gunn away from Rocky by lavishing wealth and women upon him. Rocky Jr. beats up the bullies that bugged him. Gunn leaves Rocky and immediately battles Union Caine for the heavyweight champion title and wins it. Rocky and Jr. talk and patch things up. After winning the title Gunn is hassled by reporters who argue that him winning the belt is meaningless since he never beat Rocky to obtain it and because Caine was a paper champion.Gunn finds Rocky at a local Bar and challenges him but Rocky says no. Paulie then taunts Gunn but gets beaten up. Rocky then agrees to fight Gunn in the streets. Getting some support from the Spirit of Mickey, Rocky beats Gunn up.The whole concept of Rocky losing everything he got and starting off again where he started from is pretty stupid. Also the way he lost all of his money is really ignorant. And since Paulie is supposedly the reason for them losing so much they STILL LET HIM LIVE WITH THEM!!!! Tommy Gunn is a pretty lame character. ALso a Rocky Movie with no big fight in the ring at the end is a bad idea. Rocky fighting Gunn in the ring at the end would have made this movie a little better, not much, but I guess that idea was not good.If you are a fan of the Rocky movies stay away from this one. I got the box set of Rocky from my sister for Christmas one year but I never watch this one. FOr me Rocky five never happened.",Rocky V

The film is way better then the 4th one.,6,18 May 2008,"I have heard many times from people that this is the worst in the Rocky series and does not even compare to the brilliance of the first 4. While this is not a great film it is the best since Rocky 2.In this film, a crooked accountant makes the Balboas lose all their money and have to move back to the bum house in which they occupied in the first few films. The son does not take it well and Rocky's obsession with a younger upcoming boxer is not helping his mood. The younger boxer then leaves, only to be shunned and told to get Rocky to agree to a match. The film is great. It gets a great message across and is emotional and clever at delivering the desire of finishing the Rocky series off with a bang (It was originally the last movie before ""Rocky Balboa"" came out in 2006).Overall, a fan of Rocky who likes this less then Rocky 4 has obviously not gotten the film and if up to me there would be no Rocky 4 and they just forget about that one all together.

98,MrPupkin,A sloppy but good-natured reminder of just what it is that has kept Rocky Balboa afloat for 14 years.,5,9 November 2019,Stallone trades in the ambiance of a big-fight atmosphere for senseless street-fighting. Rocky V is an unacceptable installment that tarnishes the already back-down-on-his-luck fighter. The uninspiring acting and street-smart vibe is just as damaging as the fighter's brain in this film.

100,David_Frames,"Er, I suppose we better go for it.",4,7 June 2005,"A sort of back to basics Rocky this - not very good or enjoyable unfortunately but nevermind. The forth instalment was something of a self-parodic apex for the series and there was no where left to go other than a fight between Rocky and Satan for the future of the world. Somewhat wisely sensing that perhaps the series had lost some of its original simple human drama and I do mean simple, original director John G.Avilsen was brought back to helm an instalment in which the cerebrally challenged champ is forced back to poverty when his accountant runs off with all of his money - hardly a problem you may think given the ease in forging a big X on the release papers. So its back to the old neighbourhood and Rocky takes on a cocky little upstart, Tommy Gun with the intention of living vicariously through him and getting back a bit of the old glory. When Gunn goes off with a corrupt Don King-type and forgets his old pal, the stage is set for yet another brawl, though this time its out in the street and the crowd consists of a few local drunks. The fifth and you'd have to say hopefully the last Rocky, is moribund stuff. Lots and lots of fairly middling family drama and the man himself can't even deliver the goods in the ring because of potential brain damage - not a problem in Rocky's 1-4 but again, nevermind. After Dolph Lundren the final fight is a major anti-climax, effectively a street punch-up and it all feels a bit like we're reliving old glories as much as the Stallion. A rather dull end to an otherwise enjoyable series.",Rocky V
101,lotus_chief,This series should've ended after Rocky IV...,1,29 August 2004,"This movie was just all wrong.  There's no other way to say it.  Reading some reviews on here I'm suprised to see that some people can watch this movie and really like it.  Now I'll admit, I see what they were trying to do by, in a way, revisiting the atmosphere and grittiness of the original Rocky...but this was just not the way to do it.  Rocky gets injured and is forced to retire:  I'm okay with that idea...seeing that he wasn't really prone to blocking during his fights.  The reason this film spoils the series is because it simply shatters everything that was built up in the previous four parts.  Parts I through III all had good stories, making them pretty good drama/sports films.  In pt I he's coming up just trying to get a chance, and does.  In pt II he had gotten so close, he gets a rematch and finally wins the title.  In pt III (my favorite) he stays on top but loses his hunger and his edge....so a hungry fighter coming up defeats him (Clubber Lang) and he has to go back to basics and regain the edge to climb back to the top.  I was okay with those 3.  Rocky IV was propaganda at its worst...USA vs the evil Russians, tasteless and preposterous.  Here in pt V, Rocky can't fight anymore, but what's worse is that he loses all his money due to his deadbeat brother-in-law, so he's forced to go back to the 'hood where he came up; his wife, used to expensive jewelry and fur coats and sports cars now has to work in the same pet store she did in the original.  Why was Paulie still allowed to hang around Rocky & Co after blowing all their money away?  How did Rocky's son age 5 years between pt IV and pt V??  It was bad enough we were losing key characters as the series went along (Mickey, Apollo, hell we almost lost Adrian in pt II), but now in pt V we gotta see Rocky right back where he was in the original, wearing the same black leather jacket and hat, except he's more of a nutcase.  That is VERY hard to accept after we went on a long ride hoping he succeeded...it's just very hard to swallow as a fan. If he had a couple more fights and then had to bow out gracefully for fear of greater injury and retire is one thing.  Close out the series with him on top.  But Sly and Co. somehow found it would be cool to strip away everything the Rocky character built in the previous 4 films, and this is what's most uncomfortable about Rocky V.  Like Terminator 3, I just refuse to acknowledge Rocky V's existence in my mind.  The most unnecessary sequel of all time along with T3 & Godfather III.* out of **** stars.",Rocky V
102,nims-1975,Underrated and definitely better than Rocky IV,8,1 September 2018,"Rocky V is a great film with excellent acting by Sylvester Stallone as Rocky, Talia Shire as Adrian, Burt Young as Paulie, Sage Stallone as Rocky Jr, Tommy Morrison as Tommy 'Machine' Gunn and Richard Gant as the ruthless, manipulative and malicious George Washington Duke. Tommy Gunn betrayed and disrespected Rocky by being gullible, falling for Dukes malice and praising Duke for his success and not Rocky and also getting manipulated by Duke into getting Tommy to fight against Rocky. The fighter Tommy Gunn was a very powerful fighter with strong and very powerful punches and before the final fight against Rocky in the street at the last scene, Tommy Gunn came across as being a fearless and very powerful fighter with mixed personalities 1) a friendly guy, 2) A Cruel man who wants to betray a friend and think's he's the most dangerous man around. Even though Tommy Gunn was a very powerful fighter he wasn't aware that eventually Rocky would toughen up and knock the crap out of him. The tension in this film was there and there were some great flashbacks of Rockys past which made this film also dramatic and emotional.

103,blacklist-1,An underrated Rocky movie. As brilliant as 1 and 2 with Rocky for the moment going out in style.,9,9 September 2010,"Only a 4.5 IMDb rating, I am shocked, Rocky V has been severely underrated. I thought this was as brilliant as Rocky I and II. Why I give this such a high rating is that Rocky V reverts to a similar formula of the first two of the story not just focusing on the boxing but the characters and that's what Rocky V does.The basic story continues after the fourth with Rocky (Stallone) coming home after his fight with the Russian boxer. He and his wife Adrian (Talia Shire) along with her brother Paulie (Burt Young) are greeted by the media when loudmouth George Washington Duke (Richard Gant) who is a boxing promoter comes along with his boxer to challenge Rocky to defend his title but he refuses as he announce to the media he is retiring. Things become bad for Rocky as he finds out he had irreversible brain damage if he continues to fight, it could kill him. They get even worse when Paulie makes an investment with Rocky's money with a crooked accountant and they lose everything like their house and they have to move back to Philadelphia where they move back into Pualie's house and Adrian gets her old job back at the pet shop part time. Meanwhile a young up and coming boxer Tommy ""machine gun"" Gunn asks Rocky to be his coaching manager and eventually he agrees as the kid steadily rises through the ranks. Rocky spends all his time with Tommy therefore alienating his wife and particularly his son Rocky Junior (played by his real life son Sage Stallone). This develops a side story of his son starting school and going through a rebellious stage against his father. Later Tommy becomes frustrated with Rocky for not getting him fast enough up through the ranks to become the new heavyweight champion of the world so Duke who on several occasions tries to persuade Rocky to fight snatches Tommy who does win the title but is goaded by the public and media for not acknowledging Rocky's contribution to his win. Eventually after this Rocky and his son make up but Tommy wants to prove to the media and public who goad him about his easy win of the title that he is a true champion by challenging Rocky to a fight. He goes to where Rocky lives and they have a brutal street fight.Rocky V is fantastic. Stallone gives his best performance to date. And for the first time you feel a real bond between him and his son. This makes it more authentic by the fact that father and son are in real life. There are some touching moments between them and it's sad to see his son rebelling but understandable because of his fathers rejection. Sage Stallone gives a engaging performance showing he has a great future ahead of him. Talia Shire as Adrian is excellent in this as ever and has more screen time whilst Burgess Meredith as Rocky's recent deceased coach has a small cameo in a flashback which he is terrific in. It's nice to see him again. Tommy Morrison as Tommy Gunn perfectly captures his character of a young man hungry for opportunity to progress after a bad childhood being beaten by his drunk father with a hot head as he is manipulated by Duke for money and power. There is more of a story to this as the true bond of family between husband, wife and son is felt. Throughout the films we have seen Rocky and Adrian transform themselves into more outgoing people who love each other and who we have come to care about as we have been with them on that journey. The final fight is brutal but inspiring. The film gives out a great and encouraging message that even though Rocky may have lost his career. He never lost his family or his respect as when he defeats Tommy Gunn, people chant his name. And that's what truly matters. Rocky V has heart and it's sad that Rocky Balboa (2006) is the last one, which I have yet to see and know it will a fitting end to a great boxing legend and cinema character icon. Rocky as a franchise is one of the best and strongest I've ever seen and I will miss these characters. Rocky is a legend that will never be forgotten. I certainly won't forget.",Rocky V
104,Matthew_Capitano,Rocky Jive,1,15 August 2014,"One of the top ten WORST films ever made.Rocky (rhymes with Schlocky) has brain damage to the point where he put his drunken red-nosed brother-in-law Paulie in charge of his personal finances. When Rudolph signs over the house, the car, and all of Rocky's personal savings with one signature, Rocky and his load must relocate back to the old neighborhood.We get to see here that Rocky is a terrible provider. He's made absolutely no friends in the City of Brotherly Love (Philadelphia), nobody whom he can ask, ""Yo, can I stay with you for a minute?"". Soon, Rocky gets the bright idea to dig out his old leg-breaker clothes which includes his cigarette-smell stained leather jacket, his little black hat, and the rotting handball he once bounced off the ground of the pee-stinking alleys he use to frequent.One day when Rocky is stumbling along the garbage strewn streets of Strawberry Mansion, a young punk, who may or may not be an ax-murderer, coerces Rocky to train him to be a boxer. After three minutes of dumb banter on the street corner, Rocky invites the serial killer-- I mean, the nice young man home for dinner.After a meal of liquor store grits (Adrian can cook up a supper in no time), Rocky has become so enamoured with this punk, he lets him move into Rocky Jr.'s room. Needless to say, Rocky Jr. is a bit peeved. Things go smoothly for about a day until the terrorist-- I mean, the young fighter gets romanced by a well-known fight promoter. The kid agrees to dump Rocky and take a shot at the big time.Noticing that his new protégé has turned ingrate, Rocky does everything he can to get the kid to return to Rocky Jr.'s room for more training and free-loading. The punk says no and with the end of the film drawing near, The Big Fight begins where Rocky is supposed to triumph over all evil forces.The two morons pummel one another on the street while the idiots who live there cheer Rocky on because they have absolutely nothing else to do. Rocky bashes the punk in the face, bloodies him up to a veritable pulp, and leaves him for dead in a trash can.... gee, Our Hero. As we hear chants of ""Rocky! Rocky!"" from the various half-wits of the community, Rocky walks away like a pimp while he punches his fist into the air in victory.Truly one of the STUPIDEST sequels ever squeezed out of a series that should have ended a long time ago.",Rocky V

One thing I must say is that the first ""Rocky (1986)"" movie is the Sylvester's Greatest movie of his carrer and made me a Stallone Fan.The other chapters are also good but no one can defeat the original !!!! .

By signing what he thought was an extension for his taxes turns out to be a blanket Power of Attorney giving his accountant total access to his assets. This was under the advise of his sage Paulie his brother-in-law. My first question why go to Paulie? While in Russia getting the heck beat out of him the accountant takes all of the assets in order to invest in a real estate scheme where the accountant to flip it and take the profits with nobody the wiser. When the bottom falls out Rocky is facing a giant tax liability plus the mortgage on his beloved house is delinquent which is a shock since it was paid for in cash/ Now the easy thing to do is to take a couple of easy fights. Of course Paulie is all for it since it isn't his body But sensing something is wrong insist on a battery f tests. Turns out the test show damage so Rocky hangs up the gloves. Enter the Don King like George Washington Duke who under his guidance can lift Rocky out of his plight. Despite being told ""No"" several times he persists. Then when a young hungry fighter shows up Rocky agrees to train him. Thinking he has a relationship like he had with his father figure Mickey Goldmill he becomes oblivious of the fact his family is falling apart. When Duke learns that there is no formal contract between Rocky and his charge he seduces the man away with the promise Rocky could still train him. But Duke's endgame is to get the two in the ring ""Old Lion versus Young Lion etc"". After beating a fighter ""with more glass in his jaw"" than a chandelier. Tommy Gunn thanks everyone who got him there but Rocky. Facing a hostile press at the post fight conference Tommy is beside himself. Duke seeing the opportunity convinces him he has to force into a match. Accosting at his favorite bar Rocky want no part and when Paulie confronts the man he's knocked down which Rocky challenges to a street fight. Now according to the documentary: ""Rocky Going The Distance"" the plan was for Rocky to die. The money people said or no you don't. I'm willing to wager had Rocky would have face Tommy Gunn in the ring and won people would have a different view of the movie.",Rocky V

Essentially the first 27 minutes of the film are pretty fantastic, it looks and feels almost like a traditional Rocky movie. After that first 27 minutes though, it goes downhill pretty quickly.

109,KeremUlucay,WORST ONE OF SERIES,6,2 January 2019,"This sequel's topic is awesome. It sounds great to watch Rocky as a mentor. But unfortunately, this is where movie screws. Storytelling is bad. There are some logic errors. As an example, where is Russian Drago after big fight against Rocky? Or how did Cane got the title after Rocky? Worst thing this movie have is showing us a amazingly stupid version of Rocky. For me, that character has improved us he is smarter than we think by beating up his challenger with his intelligence in third movie. And series are contradiction with each other at this point. Despite these, Rocky V has good parts too. I think Paulie has always been a very underrated character and in this movie he improved this to us. I really liked that. Although it is so ridiculous, final fight was meaninglessly satisfying. But these aren't enough for Rocky V to not being worst Rocky movie.",Rocky V
110,T-ZER0,Definitely the worst Rocky film,2,14 March 2019,"I liked Rocky, really enjoyed Rocky II, loved Rocky III, and thought IV was pretty good. But this one? God, no wonder Sylvester Stallone dislikes this film.Rocky gets back from his fight with Ivan Drago, and the first problem is that his son aged six years in three hours. (Hormones?) Then we are introduced to the most annoying character ever, George Washington Duke. A character you just want to reach through the TV and punch in the face.The movie tries to mix emotion with a great story, but ultimately fails. Rocky ignores his son for Tommy, his new trainee, who ultimately backstabs him and joins Duke. His son becomes a street thug and starts acting like a weirdo. Oh, and I almost forgot Paulie. I know he was always annoying, but this one he was unbearable. He was the reason Rocky was broke!! After, all that I'm surprised Rocky didn't just let him get hurt by Tommy. (Then again, Rocky is a good-hearted character).The emotion with Adrian isn't any better, it's brief and doesn't feel like they are connected on this film. The movie ends with a terribly choreographed street fight between Tommy and a Rocky. Which I wished would've lasted one minute. But it only lasted longer because Tommy kept tackling Rocky through walls and the street. At that point I wanted to turn off my TV.So what's the good? I can only think of one good thing. Elton John's song ""The Measure Of a Man"". I love it and it's amazing. But as for films. The cast of this movie deserves better.",Rocky V

112,sammielimehouse-84658,A Terrible Movie,6,8 August 2021,"This film is utter trash. It is borderline disrespectful to the Rocky franchise and I don't understand how anyone could have thought this movie was a good idea. I am so happy that this wasn't the ending to the Rocky character, as it would have been one of the worst franchise endings ever! Honestly, I don't think it was too bad until Rocky starts to train Tommy Gunn, but after that it sucks. Even the end fight, which is usually one of the best things about these movies, was the worst fight scene in this franchise (including Rocky's dumb fight with Thunderlips). Overall, even Rocky (my favorite movie character ever) couldn't save this crappy movie.",Rocky V
113,Cocacolaguy912-2,Surprisingly good.,8,27 December 2006,"I thought Rocky V was supposed to be bad?! No no no! It is certainly different from the other 4 in that this time Rocky is retired and is working at Mickey's gym which he now owns...and looking after his son. Great, right? A father-son movie. But the wonderful thing is, it isn't drawn out with boring scenes of bonding and what not. This movie made me more angry than Rocky IV even. I won't say why for that would just ruin the fun part. This movie stays realistic to the character of Rocky, but this time it is more about his relationship not with himself but with the people around him. This movie is fun.8/10.",Rocky V

This time around, even Stallone gives a weak performance, and Tommy Morrison fails to make an impression as Rocky's Robot Tommy Gunn.  Sly's real-life son Sage, who plays Rocky Jr,, and Burgess Meredith's brief appearance as Mickey are the only characters with any interest.  The bottom spot of the movie is the climaxing streetfight, which barely makes the film worth a watch.2 out of 5",Rocky V
115,darin-wissbaum,Rocky now the trainer on how to get hit...,4,10 August 2009,"Although not as bad as the one before with the Russian, this one still pretty much stinks. The Rocky films since 1976 have lost focus. At least in this one we are shown how the effects of Rocky getting hit so many times in the head have taken its toll. But in reality any real boxer never would have allowed himself to be hit as many times as Rocky. In Any case Rocky takes the trainer position in this one taking on some punk loser from the streets and training him on the art of boxing...or how to allow himself to be hit time and again in the head and face. This film was predictable right from the start. For example, we know the punk kid will get bought out by some other trainer, we know Rocky will have to fight this kid in the end, we know Rocky will win and the movie will have one of those cheesy endings that all Rocky films have. Did I mention that Rocky is poor in this one? Yeah he lost all his money....Adrian!!!",Rocky V
116,saint405,A classic saga ends on a good note,6,23 June 2005,"I've heard a lot of rumors about Rocky V. Mostly they all have the same message, the film is bad! Well I recently saw Rocky V and I must say I enjoyed it greatly.Sly returns as the boxer Rocky who retires from the ring after his victory match against Drago from Part 4. But when he returns he learns he has brain damage. Sadly for him, the mortgage takes back all his fortunes including his house, car, money, etc. because of Uncle Pauly.The Balboa family is sent back to Philadolphea to live in the slums like Rocky did in the beginning of the original Rocky. There Rocky's son must adjust to rough gangs beating on him but can't do anything because his dad is training a amateur boxer by the name of Tommy Gunn. Rocky Jr. joins a gang and Gunn leaves Rocky for a flashy Don King Promoter by the name of George Washington Duke. Rocky has to get use to the stab in his back as he is called out by Gunn for a life threatening street fight outside a bar. There Rocky must choose between fighting or running.Much of the cast returns including the great Burgess Meredith as Micky.The film is the weakest in the Rocky series but it is not as bad as people say it is. I think this film ended a good saga of boxing. If you enjoyed the other installments of the Rocky series, don't listen to the bad reviews. Check the movie out and enjoy.",Rocky V
117,feakes,Nature is smarter then people think. the measure of a man.,10,20 June 2016,Rocky V gets a bad rap. the fans don't like it and the critics hated it and its the only Rocky movie to LOSE money at the box office. But I love it. Actually it's my favorite rocky right after The first one. And I'll tell you why. ROCKY III and ROCKY IV took Rocky out of his elements. ROCKY III HAD to do this as it showed how success affected Rocky. ROCKY IV had too many ideas going thru it. Man VS Machine VS Steroids And political Ideas running rampant. Rocky in an American Flag basically. Rocky IV is not a bad movie but I still don't take it as a serious Rocky movie. Rocky V on the other hand takes us back.Rocky V opens as Rocky starts to feel the effects of Drago's super punches He collapses in the shower and as a frightened Adrian holds him he talks to her and he speaks to Mickey we can't see him. rocky is existing in both worlds the living and the dead. He talks about how mickey used to fight so hard that sometimes he felt like he broke something inside and how he now feels it too. They go home to a media circus where George Washington Duke A crooked promoter is trying to get rocky to defend the Heavyweight Championship against his fighter Union Cane. Rocky is tired and Adrian tells the press after this match against Drago rocky is now officially retired. a medical check up reveals brain damage from drago's punches. Putting a end to Rocky's career. then rocky finds out he's broke sending him back. It seems he had a crooked accountant that tricked Paulie into giving him power of attorney and that and the fact that he had not paid Rocky's taxes in four years leaves them penniless. the Balboa's find themselves back where it all started in Paulie's old house. Rocky finds to his amazement that Mickey had left His gym to Rocky. and Adrian has gone back to the pet shop. sometimes it seems like they never even left.then Rocky meets a young fighter named Tommy Gunn. Tommy grew up idolizing rocky and wants him to train him and manage him. rocky takes him on and soon Tommy begins a quick rise to the top. But Rocky while living thru Tommy begins to lose his family.Tommy soon falls under the influence of George Washington Duke and he turns Tommy against Rocky. Tommy Wins the Heavyweight Championship but no one takes him seriously comparing him to Rocky. forcing them into a street fight. rocky Wins and he realizes. He didn't need the money the fame and the glory/ all he needed is his friends his family and Adrian.ROCKY V ends on a happy note. rocky is in a happy place and has his family back. And to me that is Where Rocky belongs On the streets of Philly not rich not poor but doing very Well for himself and inspiring others to do their best. Like I said ROCKY IV took him the furthest away from the roots of Rocky. Rocky V returns him to them.A Good solid story. and maybe the second best one in the series. at least for me. |,Rocky V
118,LuckyFour-LeafClover,Did we ever leave this place?,9,8 August 2020,"So in this installment Rocky's life comes full circle in that he goes from riches to rags and has to move back into the old Philly neighborhood he started in. Despite the plot holes of Paulie becoming POA and the age difference of Robert from Rocky 4 to 5, it's imo a good movie.I loved the father and son dynamic of Rocky and his real life son Robert. Robert struggles with his new surroundings and gets bullied but like his father has it in him to confront his fears through hard work. However, Rocky isn't much help to his son whose always being distracted on reclaiming his fame through Tommy Gunn. Good stuff there.The movie also stressed how good of a wife Adrienne was to Rocky standing by her man even when he lets out all his frustrations.I know many don't care for this movie and even Stallone isn't fond of it. But I always thought this movie had heart. If nothing else even for those who dislike it it played an important role in Rocky 6 and the Creed franchise in that Rocky was no longer living lavishly in mansions. The Rocky in Rocky 3 and 4 didn't really feel authentic. He's always more a down to earth guy",Rocky V
119,KillerLord,Good movie done wrongly!,6,3 February 2007,"Coming straight to the point, if Stallone was planning to make Rocky V as the final installment in the Rocky series he should have put in more effort and been more careful in handling the subtleties of the movie. Stallone did come up with a creative idea to take the Rocky series in a different direction but I guess he failed to deliver everything right. Although I must make it very clear in the beginning itself that I do not rate this movie as bad as many others have.First of all, let me relax myself by taking out my frustration on the music. Music is one of the most important factors that characterizes the Rocky movies. Right from the first film to the fourth Rocky movies are known to give stunningly energetic music. This was totally missing in Rocky V. All music in Rocky V was rap. I mean no insult to rap music or rap musicians but the music just did not fit. It was a shocker for me when I heard the Rocky V tracks at a friend's place.Some people have expressed their disagreement with the very idea of Rocky losing all his money, house and all and coming back to the old neighborhood. I felt that was okay but how it was eventually handled was not so effective. It always could have been done in a better way. Scripting was not so effective, I must admit. As I said, more effort was needed in handling subtleties. When you have decided that a world famous boxer was going from riches back to rags you ought to think hard about every word and every scene.Stallone did a remarkable job by ripping the financial power of Rocky for this created room for large number of ways in which the movie could be taken forward. But where the movie scored low was Stallone not being able to capitalize on the room that was created. I felt that if this movie would have been longer I would not have a problem but my gut feeling says that there was a scope for handling things in a much better way.Stallone creates a challenging character for himself in Rocky V. But he does not deliver the best performance in comparison to his performance in other movies. He does a decent job though with regards to the parts dealing with Rocky's strained relationship with his son. This was, to me, the best part of the movie - the whole portrayal of the father-son relationship, of course ignoring the direction glitch of the sudden aging of Rocky Jr. Sage Stallone did a decent job with his acting considering it was a debut film.Rocky V had its other positives apart from the father-son relationship. One of them being the words of Micky Goldmill recalled by Rocky. ""Get up, you son of a bitch! Cause Micky loves ya!"" was amazing to me. And one thing the movie did manage to do to me was to make me hate Tommy Gunn so much that I could not help but scream out loud during the end fight, ""Take him down, Rocky"" A decent movie with a good story but just not executed well!",Rocky V
120,On_The_Mark,Completely baffled by the good reviews - this is awful,3,19 April 2021,"The first two Rockys were great. The third was good. The fourth was not too good. But this one, man it's terrible.I just watched it again after watching the previous four. Forget that it takes place right after the Drago fight (which came out in 85), which puts it in 1981 (this came out in 1990), Rocky's son in the last film was about 5, but suddenly in a few weeks he's been in Russia, has aged about 6 or 7 years (played by his real son).In the original Rocky I & II, Rocky was a lumbering white collar guy. In III, he becomes this classy, nice clothes wearing well speaking individual. He literally glides as he walks (watch Rocky 4 when Apollo is about to fight Drago and they introduce Rocky, he glides across the ring). But now he's a lumbering dolt again, just like that. He's back to the type of clothes he wore before he got famous. Why? He didn't sell all his clothes when he lost his money. He didn't just get stupid off one fight and speak like a moron again.But forget all that. The whole story is painful to watch. Bad dialog, numerous montages (to sell the soundtrack of course - and in this one we've got rap), Adrian is just the one note whiner now and everything is boring and poorly written. I hated this movie, more than when I first saw it. It's an insult to the Rocky movies. You watch those first two movies, so full of heart, so extremely well written and acted. By 1990 Stallone's massive ego got in the way of his acting and it shows here. This is a hard watch.I think Stallone is a super talented guy who went through a long period of bad movies starting with this one. I'm a huge fan of the Rocky movies but I absolutely hated this one.",Rocky V
121,mercury4,A lot of you people really need to lighten up,10,28 January 2002,"When I was little I loved this movie. I later started to get negative though and hate it. I've changed now. I still think it is a good movie. So Rocky V wasn't the best. So Rocky doesn't fight in the ring. None of these things make Rocky V a bad movie. It has a great story, a great beginning and a great climactic fight. I wish other films can have as great a fight scene as the one in this one. The cool part is Tommy Gun is Tommy Morrison a real life boxer. I only wish I can see Rocky slug it out with another fighter like Mike Tyson or even fight The Rock.This isn't the best Rocky, but it's a very good movie. I still recognize it as being part of the series. All of the true Rocky fans should. My only problems are that the movie is too contemporary, Rocky has brain damage and how it keeps showing flash backs of the Drago fight. Rocky proved in Rocky IV that Drago was just a man and in this they take it back. It's like Drago is haunting him. Also how everyone looks too old, especially Talia Shire. And how the hell did the son grow so fast. I'm sure Rocky wasn't in Russia for years and why was Duke out of the movie so fast. He's a great character. In the end it shows photos from the previous Rocky movies to I guess say it's over. Please Sly. Make another Rocky. End the series with another great Rocky movie. Don't end the series yet.",Rocky V
122,jason_13,"The worst in the series, but still good",6,26 February 2006,"I have said many times that I am probably one of the very few movie fans that love all Rocky sequels. Don't really know why. Love the 80s decade and I regret I am born in 1990 and I have missed these great years for movies. The original is classic and all the sequels are some of the most entertaining sequels to a movie ever made. Kinda underrated maybe. Now back to the 5th which we thought is the last. Here we have an older Rocky with a son. A talented guy wants Rocky to coach him in boxing and he agrees, cause he thinks the boy may become like him and as a matter of fact, he sees himself in this boy while the truth is far from Rocky's understandings. He becomes obsessed by this guy and he coaches him every day all day long and the boy becomes a real boxer that cannot be beaten. Rocky forgets his family, doesn't have time for his son's problems and basically this is the new stuff here.Well, not bad. Don't like a son introduction, don't like the different Rocky which is kinda stupid, cause Rocky has never been so smart to realize that he is split between coach and a father. He listens to everyone and agrees. At least this is what I have noticed in most everyday life scenes from the previous movies.Why it is the worst? Well, it is needless in my opinion. It's not Rocky who fights. In fact I thought that the whole 5th movie could have been made into 2 or 3 scenes and put in the previous movies. It has nothing to do with a progress in the plot except for the son. Anyway, I respect it a lot, cause it is simply Rocky.6 out of 10.",Rocky V
123,ginger_sonny,Wooden,4,9 August 2004,"Rocky V Wisely choosing to retire Rocky from the main action in the ring, Stallone instead puts his mind to training newcomer Morrison to step into his shoes. However, big business risks getting in the way. Potentially much more interesting is the sub-plot of Rocky trying to patch things up with his son (played by Stallone's real offspring), but this is handled with much less finesse than characterized the original Rocky. Odd that Stallone, who can be a great actor (as his performance in Copland illustrated), gives such wooden performances in the films that should be closest to his heart.

125,Jsimpson5,"Good, but not the best",6,21 December 2006,"Usually as a film has more sequels the later sequels tend to less than good. Most people will tell you that Rocky V falls under this group. Most people also say that Rocky V was the worst Rocky movie out there. In my opinion Rocky V is not as bad as it sound.This movie takes place about a week or so after the events of Rocky IV. Rocky loses all of his money and his other items, when his brother-in-law makes a bad choices and give power of attorney to their accountant who takes all of Rocky's money. Rocky also learns that he has brain damage and thus can no longer fight. Rocky moves into his brother in law's old house and starts running Mick's old gym. Around this time, Rocky meets a young boxer named Tommy Gunn who wants to train under Rocky. Tommy who can fight well, has the heart about the size of a dime.Most people were disappointed to find out that Rocky does not have some high profile fight. The acting at times could also leave somethings to be desired. Tommy Morrison about 60 percent or more of the times makes his character seem wooden, and leaves a lot in the character development department.Another thing that gripes me about this film is putting Sylvester Stallone's real life son as Rocky's son in the movie. Why do I have a gripe about this I will explain. Now it's understandable that the actor who played Rocky's son in the 4th film could not be his son in this film, as he would have age and gotten older, but in Rokcy IV, Rocky's son is supposed to be like 10 or something. When Sage Stallone comes in to the picture he now looks like he is 15. So did his movie son magically age 5 years in a matter of a week? I highly doubt that.Overall with the gripes that I have about this film it's not a bad film. If you have watched the previous Rocky films then watch this, you won't regret it.",Rocky V

Rocky (sylvester stallone)loses his fortune to a crooked attorney and goes back to his old roots in philladelphia and trains a new protege, the late real life world heavyweight champion (tommy morrison)
THE GOOD
* Tones down the far fetched formula
of rocky 3&4 with a believable plot and realistic fight scenes.
* The heartfelt scene in the gym were rocky remembers recieving rocky marcianos necklace from mickey.
* The scene when adrianne tells rocky he beat all those fighters with heart not muscle after tommy betrays him.
* Tommy morrisons performance as tommy gunn is pretty good in his first movie role.
THE BAD
* Rocky junior has aged 3 years when the events of this film are a week after rocky 4, this totally contradicts rocky 4 altogether this is silly.
* Surely rocky could have got himself out of his financial prediciment even though it was too dangerous to fight again, he learned to read why not do commercials? This is definately questionable.
* The script is sub par compared to last entries.
THE UGLY
* This is sylvester stallones worst performance in the franchise, i know hes supposed to be brain damaged but the performance feels cringe worthy and inconsistant.
* duke washingtons character is clearly based on real life promoter don king- (An ugly guy inside and out) which feels like a cheap rip off.

Obviously they ran out of ideas and they didn't know where they wanted to go with this franchise, this was nothing more than a cash-grab, at least in my opinion. As a huge Rocky fan I really wanted to like it but I just couldn't. It may speak to some of you and I do admire you for it. Sadly I just don't see the appeal.",Rocky V
129,michaelheiser-25099,Better Rocky,9,9 November 2021,"Better Rocky in the series. Better than even the original I thought. Rocky returns home. The Balboas discover that while they were gone, Paulie left power of attorney to their accountant who took all the money and accidentally lost it all. Plus they discover they have years of unpaid taxes. With Rocky's status, he would just need to do a few more fights to clear the money problems. But they find out that Rocky has suffered an irreversible brain injury that could be fatal if he continued fighting. So they move back to the ghetto and Rocky trains young upstart, Tommy Gunn, who is a huge fan of Rocky's. Rocky distances himself from his family and resentment from them towards him grows. When Tommy betrays Rocky, he learns he must fight once more. The first problem is getting Stallone's real son, Sage, to play his son in this. Rocky's son ages 5 years in 1 month. The next problem is how easily they moved back to the slums of Philly. Rocky is the biggest boxer in the world, so why didn't he do some commercials and other celebrity endorsements like he did in Rocky 3? These are the only problems I have with this. What makes this movie great and the most original is the distinct message, subplots, and final fight. In every Rocky movie, the message is to follow your dreams and don't give up. They are conveyed differently in each of them. This one's main message is the importance of family. As Rocky's trainings were growing stronger and stronger, the respect from his family grew weaker and weaker. When Rocky finally does wake up, that last bit has a huge impact. Also, the subplots were great too, just like the others.",Rocky V
130,actaction,Return to Serious Form Over goofy jokes,6,2 September 2020,"I was surprised to learn this film was supposed to be a failure and even not liked by Stallone himself, as it undid the franchise damage caused by the goofy fourth entry and returned it to a serious tone, closer to the vibe of Rocky III. It takes itself seriously enough to have real struggle going throughout, Rocky learns something and the characters greatness is preserved and interestingly enough in a street battle rather than another sanctioned fight. If this movie hadn't happened, if they hadn't shed cheesy jokes like the robot servant from part 04, the character could have never come back years later in additional movies and I think the character would have become a larger than life joke, rather than the piece of sacred movie history that it is now.",Rocky V

Rocky telling the Russians that they can change? Pretty lame, I watch it now and wince. Let's see... Rocky 5 came out in 1990 and I didn't have any interest in seeing it until it was the only thing on a week ago, 14 years later. Boy was I surprised at how bad it was, worse than I thought it would be.For one thing, I had pictured it being the end of Rocky's fighting and thought he was going to be the trainer for Tommy through the whole movie, sharing victory with Tommy through a manager's perspective as he wins in the end. Boy was I wrong. Tommy quits Rocky and joins Don King's clone. Does Sly enjoy having a big mouthed black nemesis in all his boxing flicks? Okay, 4 out of 5. And why they stick with Pauly the loser is beyond me. Rocky 5 is a testosterone overdose as Balboa ends up in a long overdrawn fist fight with Tommy in the streets as everyone watches. This time Rocky's son does the Adrian look as he watches the news showing it all on TV. I was surprised Stu Nahan wasn't there with the commentary. Rocky sounds as dumb as ever in this movie. Does all the years of leading with his head make him regressively talk even more like an illiterate idiot from New York?",Rocky V
132,DrPhibes1964,Starts strong,6,20 June 2021,"Rocky V starts strong but gradually gets sillier and more predictable. We open in the locker room immediately following the brutal beating at the hands of Ivan Drago and see that Rocky has sustained serious head trauma. He sits alone on a bench and asks one of his crew to get Adrienne. He tells her that he cannot stop his hands from shaking, becoming even more disoriented when he says: ""I wanna go home, Mick"". It is probably the most moving moment of the series. In the last three films Rocky is portrayed as a machine who seems incapable of being hurt. Here we see him in a state of vulnerability that has never been displayed. I was hoping that this was going to push the series in another direction, away from the cartoonish quality of the last three and back to the realism of the first. But as soon as the character of Tommy Gunn is introduced as well as the Don King style boxing promoter it becomes very predictable. Even the secondary story of his son's struggles to adjust to a less luxurious lifestyle that he had previously enjoyed holds no surprises. When the brain damage is reintroduced later in the film it is laughably handled. The film had potential but seemed to play it safe and pander to audience expectations instead of trying something different, ending with the obligatory Big Fight. If handled more realistically the central story of an older boxer mentoring a younger one could have been interesting, more of a slice-of-life film, but when a big box office profit is at stake a major studio wants to eliminate the possibility of a failure. It's a pity that film has become so money minded and lost that ideal to tell new and interesting stories. Sequels have become just carbon copies of their successful predecessor.",Rocky V

For not having that passion so present that stood out in the first two and the entertainment so present in the fourth, Rocky V develops from a plot that doesn't build up to be as good as it should be, adds many sub-plots, which most are very poorly established, as well as an exaggerated drama and even characters that have already been established undergo changes in their personality, the main example is Adrian. Another problem is the antagonists, they suffer from the same issues that are in the third movie, which is not exploiting and developing seriously these characters making them strong and imposing figures when they're on the screen, passing the image of important individuals, instead, they're very superficial and boring. Something incredible and new from this one is the fact that even the fights aren't good as before, they're well choreographed and filmed, but fail to excite and far from being breathtaking.",Rocky V

Then Tommy turns in to the Heavyweight champion of boxing but all the people think he sucks and hes not the real champion. So he decides to fight Rocky. Rocky owns him.

Most Rocky fans are not children anymore and can not be expected to play along as such.The emergence of Tommy Gunn was kind of fun, but the premise of the plot is so fabled, as to be impossible. There is no fixing this kind of disappointment.The only positive thing that can be said about this film is the quasi-inspiration, though prototypical, premise of sticking together and weathering the storm. The father and son dynamic is rather good in this one, making this film an installation with some merit.But it is all undermined by the ridiculous and highly unlikely plot points.Kudos for trying, I guess.",Rocky V
143,dgl1199,Cuz Mickey luvs ya..,7,22 March 2005,"Sly took a big chance with this one. After IV it was considered over, the Rocky saga ended with illustrious flag-waving camp and post-fight moronic platitudes about political allegiances. I will say though that I did like IV very much, the ending was just a little ridiculous though. Extending the Rocky tale meant an audience was going start off with one question- ""Now what?"" Rocky Balboa is hands down one of my favorite fictional heroes. He's likable, funny, strong, full of integrity. I really wanted to like this movie. It has problems, though, serious problems. First, the guy loses everything? All the money is gone and he's back on the street? That was a little hard to swallow. Next he decided to train some stalker and mold him into his own image to the detriment of his relationship with his only son? It was a little hard to grasp but I did see where he was going with that. Rocky knew he couldn't, or shouldn't, fight anymore so he lives vicariously and by extension through Tommy Gunn; with Rocky assuming himself as a young ""Mickey in the making"". It was alluring, to the exclusion of all else. But what I did find very appealing about this movie was the running commentary about the dark side of professional boxing. There was a reason he included a Don Kingish promoter to personify all that is seedy and wrong with the sport. You wanted to kill this guy by the end.What saves this film is the street fight at the end. I don't think it was the best fight scene of the Rockys but it was damn good and damn intense. Rocky is almost out and we see flashbacks of his earlier defeats as the birdies circle his battered head. Then, in an MTVish style Mickey returns in smoke and strobes and berates him to get on his feet. ""You're the champ! He's not a machine! Get up, get on your feet you son of a bitch! Cuz Mickey loves you.."" Now THAT was just really cool.",Rocky V

It has the same feel as all of the other ""Rocky"" movies. It is a standard underdog type of tale. The story is realistic until the end kind of. And the 5th installment deals a lot more with Rocky Balboa's family life than his fighting and such.After the events in ""Rocky IV,"" Balboa returns home to the USA to great media and country applause. But that soon ends when Rocky is pronounced unfit to box and he loses all his money with a financial error by his lawyer. So he moves back to the old neighborhood in Philly with Adrian and Robert, Jr., his son. Paulie makes quite a lot of appearances, but it is unsure whether he lives with his brother-in-law's family or not.And that's when Rocky meets Tommy Gunn, a hotshot fighter who requests Rocky's help. He has enormous potential, but he is young and he refuses to listen. When Gunn wins fights, but craves more, he ditches Rocky for a big time promoter. But Gunn is always in his mentor's shadow as he learns after the fights and money don't bring him the love of the fans. For its like Adrian Balboa says, ""They love you because you won with heart, not your fists."" But Tommy, not knowing that, feels that he has to beat Rocky with his fists to show he is the more superior fighter.With plenty of good suspense and lessons, the 5th installment in the ""Rocky"" series is a winner, but most don't seem to feel that way.",Rocky V
145,connorbbalboa,A desperate sequel with a poor script and cringe-worthy finale,3,28 November 2016,"Sylvester Stallone once said he strictly made Rocky V to make a few dollars. Perhaps that explains why this Rocky film has hardly anything to offer. The first two Rocky films had great stories and really likable characters that you rooted for, so much so that you didn't care about how unbelievable some of the circumstances regarding the fights may have been. Rocky III didn't do it as effectively, but made up for it with some great entertainment value and a feeling of self- awareness regarding Stallone's career for the next couple of decades. Rocky IV threw all seriousness out the door and the quality steeped even more than with Rocky III, but it can be entertaining on a primitive level, similar to Stallone's other 1985 hit, Rambo: First Blood Part II. This film offers almost nothing special. It wants to be gritty and emotional like the first Rocky, but it can't seem to avoid having some scenes that are a bit, shall we say, ""macho;"" unfortunately, those parts are out of place with the rest of the film and don't make it more fun. Having just defeated Ivan Drago (watch Rocky IV to understand everything), Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) returns home with his family and finds out that, thanks to Paulie, his brother-in-law (Burt Young), his accountant has stolen all of his money since he has power of attorney. What prevents him from fighting again to win some money is the fact that he has gotten significant brain damage (I can hear the realists saying ""Finally,"" since Rocky would've suffered from this long ago if this was real life), and all he can do is auction off his big house, most of his stuff, move back with his family to Paulie's house in the same, poor Philadelphia neighborhood they once lived in, and run the gym of his late trainer and friend, Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith, who appears in a tear-jerking flashback). Also, he trains a young boxing hopeful named Tommy Gunn (real boxer Tommy Morrison, who passed away in 2013), and is harassed by boxing promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant), while ignoring his son (Stallone's real son, Sage), who is beaten up by bullies at school every day. Now, the main problem with Rocky V is its screenplay. First off, the way Rocky loses his money makes little sense; what he thought was a tax extension was really a power of attorney. How could anyone not notice the difference? Also, while Rocky's family thought they had paid fully the mortgage on their house, they still have $400,000 outstanding. Again, how could they have not noticed this? Also, Duke is a one- dimensional villain (a common trope in a lot of Rocky and Rambo sequels it seems) and a cartoon character that jars terribly with how serious the film wants to be. Also, when Tommy is asked by Duke to turn away from Rocky and sign with him, you'd think, given how much Rocky and Tommy seem to bond during the film, that Tommy would have doubts, but not once does he think, ""I dunno: Rocky's my friend. He really got me somewhere. Do I really want to do this?"" But no: he just signs with Duke and when he beats the Heavyweight Champion, he only acknowledges Duke and completely ignores Rocky. Rocky's son is another problem with this film. He gets mad that his father won't help him against the bullies, but he later seems to take care of that problem (with physical violence against the bullies, of course) by himself, which just leaves him upset that Rocky is paying more attention to Tommy and not him, which causes him to act like a little punk (on Christmas of all days!!!). Rocky says that having Tommy as his student gives him a purpose in life, but throughout the two montages that show Tommy training and winning fights, there's no sense of development. Tommy's character arc just seems to be made up as the film goes along. First, he seems like a young hopeful who wants to box and eagerly accepts Rocky as his trainer, then he signs on with Duke without any shred of doubt and abandons Rocky, then he beats the Heavyweight Champion and gets mad because everyone thinks he's not good enough to fight strong opponents (the guy Tommy beats only got the title through contract), he challenges Rocky to a fight at Duke's insistence, and then, when Tommy provokes Rocky into a street fight, he yells at Duke, ""You don't own me! Nobody does!"" Not to mention, the street fight is an absolutely ridiculous affair that no one in their right mind would shoot for television and just stand aside to watch, and it destroys any credibility the film did have. Rocky V is a complete waste of time and something not worth spending a few dollars to watch on demand or ten dollars to buy on Blu-Ray. More action-oriented fans can be forgiven for liking Rocky IV, but please stay away from this freak misfit.",Rocky V
146,wackyfuncrazy,Brilliant,10,27 January 2006,"After his last fight against Drago, Rocky realises it is probably time to retire. This makes Rocky come to terms with his life and what is really important in his life. Whether his success as a boxer is most important to him or whether his family and happiness is. He tries to train a new boxer to try and recapture his old glory but it just bites back in his face. Which is a metaphor i think for the way recapturing old glory just makes people feel worse about themselves when they inevitably fail. Sylvester Stallone acts brilliantly as Rocky in this film with raw emotions such as anger and sadness. He is completely believable as Rocky from start to finish and not one scene is badly written. Some fans think the film is not part of the storyline (canon) but I think it makes perfect sense. The fans were angered that the last film has Rocky not glorious, just carrying on with a normal life. All boxers eventually end their careers with no glory. they are not the champions they once were. George Foreman is just a priest and family man now, and Frank Bruno is not what he used to be. So Rocky V was a fitting end to the Rocky series. His glory behind him but still better things to come as he looks after his wife and son. The press gave it bad reviews probably because it was a long drawn out saga and they were probably angered about Stallone's not being able to write new material. RockyV also shows the bad side of boxing with George Washington Duke (played brilliantly by Richard Gant) representing Don King. Duke tries to lure Rocky back to the ring even though it may cause brain damage. He does it for his own personal gain. Rocky V shows what happens towards the end of a boxer's career and what can happen if people like Don King ruin and disgrace such a noble sport for their own profit. The fight at the end is brilliant with wonderful drama, emotion and adrenaline with Rocky triumphing against the odds to deliver another awe-inspiring victory making this film the best in the series.",Rocky V

He moves back to the streets of Philly with Paulie and Adrian and begins to train a new fighter, Tommy Gunn. Tommy is bombarded by the press and agrees to fight professionally. He betrays Rocky and hurts Paulie. Thankfully Rocky kicks his ass.What i didn't like at all was the fact that rocky ended up where he started, with nothing to show for what he had achieved in the past.

The movie has a good message saying it's not all about money, it's about family & friends. Rocky eventually starts training Tommy Gunn, a young hungry boxer who has the tools but not the skill to become champion. Rocky is basically Micky now, a full 180. Stallone is excellent as rocky again, & the end credits are great with flash backs of the story. I would have been happy to end the whole rocky story like that.The only thing I didn't like was sage Stallone as his son(RIP) I didn't think he was a good actor but that's about it. It's was a good ending to a saga & I honestly think this is better than rocky balboa. If you haven't watched it in a while give it another go, it's actually aged really well.

156,shaquanda36,"Imperfect, but overly maligned",7,12 April 2008,"Here is a movie that has taken a lot of heat. Looking back on it after having watched the new final film in the series, Rocky Balboa, I believe some of the extreme negativity came from two places - the fatigue that comes from watching a fifth installment in a movie series, and the belief that this would be the last movie in the series.As the final film in the series, this movie was a disappointment - Rocky is a boxer, and he never steps into the ring. Also, it is a stylistic departure from the film that immediately preceded - V looks and feels much more like Rocky I than Rocky IV, which may have been jarring to some.Rocky V works better as a fifth installment rather than as the final film. We can overlook the fact that there is no training montage and that Rocky does not step into the ring. We can accept the stylistic departure from Rocky IV because Balboa continues in the vein of Rocky V. We can get past the unrealistic plot point of Rocky losing all of his fortune, because we see he finds a way to get by in Rocky Balboa.There are still some things that are simply bad in Rocky V that Rocky Balboa does not make acceptable, namely the fight at the end. Rocky V does not build naturally to a fight - this is a movie that is ultimately about overcoming hardship and the complexities of family life. The fight did nothing to conclude that story - it seemed contractually obligated. It is also strange that his son magically ages several years during the few months that Rocky is in Russia.Still, it is an acceptable installment in the series, if not an acceptable ending. Stallone gives a better performance than he did in III or IV, and it develops the father-son element of the greater story quite nicely.",Rocky V
157,davidtkd-25249,Rocky V (1990): Go For It!,6,5 January 2018,"Rocky V is a 1990 film starring Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Tommy Morrison, Richard Gant, Sage Stallone, and Burgess Meredith. The film was written by Sylvester Stallone and directed by OSCAR winning director John G. Avildsen, who directed the original ROCKY (1976).Upon returning from his latest triumph, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) learns that all his money has been lost by an unscrupulous financial advisor. To make matters worse, his fight-related injuries force his retirement from the ring. So Rocky, his wife Adrian (Talia Shire), his friend Paulie (Burt Young), and his son Rocky Jr. (Sage Stallone) move to their old, low-rent neighborhood in South Philadelphia. There, the fighter must resolve the deep-rooted resentment held by his son, a bitterness that grows when Rocky trains Tommy ""The Machine"" Gunn (Tommy Morrison), a young boxer who soon rises to national prominence. When Tommy turns against his mentor and publicly taunts him, Rocky knows he must fight once more.ROCKY V was made on a budget of $42,000,000. The film grossed $120,000,000 worldwide, making it the least successful film financially in the entire franchise. The film is reviewed by fans and critics alike as the worst film in the ROCKY franchise. While I do agree that ROCKY V is the worst film in the franchise, I do believe that ROCKY V is supremely underrated. The music by Bill Conti once again is superb. Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, and Burgess Meredith all have wonderful performances as they have had in ROCKY - ROCKY IV. Sage Stallone has an OK performance. Could have been better, could have been worse. Real-life boxer Tommy Morrison does a decent job as Tommy ""The Machine"" Gunn. John G. Avildsen, who directed the original ROCKY (1976), does a good job at the director's chair for one last ROCKY film. Overall, ROCKY V, while being the worst film in the franchise, still is a highly underrated film. I thought that this was a very decent film. 6/10.",Rocky V
158,du_man,An absolute dud,3,4 February 2005,"Rocky V 1990 *Despite suffering brain damage (to what?), Rocky returns home triumphantly only to discover that Paulie has accidentely squandered the entire fortune. So he goes back on the streets, down on his luck, etc. He starts training a new guy, in the meantime ignoring his family. Then the new guy turns on him. The fifth in the series is, well, absolutely terrible. It's boring and pointless no matter how you look at it. It's also very, very stupid. And inconsistent. And the climactic fight scene is just badly done. In fact, the only really good thing about this movie is the excellent acting, which might have saved it if Stallone had put just one good thing into his script (although there are a couple of good scenes early on). I guess this was just made during the time when Stallone was making duds, and he had to make the Rocky series join the crowd. That's all I can come up with.",Rocky V
159,adam_evans14,rocky returns to the streets!,7,9 October 2008,"There is much pessimism surrounding this film...and i think its mainly because it doesn't show everything as rosy in the life of rocky balboa...the viewers of the previous 4 films were just so used to seeing rocky winning, they couldn't handle it when this film was released and slated it. However their criticism holds little ground in my opinion, Rocky 5 is an all round good film.The most notable difference is that the makers have decided to opt for something different this time. It would have been easy enough to just put rocky in the ring again for another 15 rounds against a different opponent,but they haven't which I'm all for because,i think if we're all honest, it was getting tedious. Rocky 3 and 4 epitomised the word 'cheesy'...they actually gave deeper meaning to the word. It was especially pitiful listening to the speech at the end of rocky 4, because it was trying to hard and failing to include deeper morals within the script (if you remember the word ""change"" was used a lot.... blah blah).Rocky 5 however does have a solid script whether its everyones cup of tea or not. I think that had rocky 5 been a completely independent movie and the previous 4 were not made, it would have had rave reviews. Rocky 5 gives us character development that no other rocky film does (aside from rocky 1 which Adrien is the main source). Tommy Gunn changes a great deal throughout the film (at first hes a young talent who idolises rocky, and slowly is manipulated by a boxing promoter, and becomes jealous of rocky). I think this development shows the script has had thought put into it.Another main criticism put forth by fans of rocky is that Rocky's trainer isn't in the film for more than five minutes at the beginning. Yes he isn't in the film long, but this also works out for the best. It would have been ludicrous to have had him come live with rocky or something while hes bankrupt.Overall rocky 5 is a good film that should be given a chance, albeit Rocky's 1 and 2 are still the most superior made.",Rocky V
160,mosquito1985,Sad ending.,5,11 June 2003,Rocky retires due to brain damage by russian boxer Ivan Drago. Good film but lacks some of the magic of the previous films. Rocky finds out that he is in seriously in the red when Paulie signs the power of attorney to a dumb solicitor. To make ends meet Rocky has to sell his possessions and his mansion in an auction and returns to Philadelphia. Later on he trains new comer Tommy Gunn.,Rocky V
161,liamkellybusiness,Not terrible but forgettable.,5,6 May 2020,"There isn't much to say about Rocky V. Compared to the first four instalments in the franchise it's totally boring and unimaginative. I still believe the series should've ended after Rocky III to serve as a complete trilogy as Rocky IV is where the series begins to slip. This however, was the straw that broke the camels back for me. Each film got consistently worse as the series went along and this one totally misses the mark. There were strong scenes with some good acting that would've been so much better had the film itself been a great one but overall, it's a no from me.",Rocky V
162,PatoRonald,It's not as bad as i thought it would be,5,19 November 2020,"Don't get me wrong, the movie is bad ...
But not muchRocky V wanted to kind of pay homage to the first film, with a more urban theme again, a detail that was missing a little in the previous Rocky franchise films, like Rocky IV and Rocky III, I thought it was cool what they did, even if the reason for that comeback was kind of weird, I think it was the best part of the film, being very sincere.His first and second acts are very reasonable, nothing so sensational, nothing at the level of ""Rocky quality"", the film has a moral lesson from father to son, very different from everything that was presented to us before, this is not a problem, only it makes me feel strange, it doesn't look like Rocky, it doesn't look like I'm watching a Rocky movie, but a cheesy fatherly Christmas movieWhat destroys the film, in my opinion, is the third act, a fight on the street?
Really?
was it supposed to be the peak of the movie?
the big final fight?
Rocky's big final fight?I think they should have left Stallone as a director, at least he would know what to do with a weak script like that, at least he would put emotion in the film, real emotions.The movie is not all bad, it even has cool things, but ""Rocky V"" is not up to the other films in the Rocky franchise, it is ""ok"", that's all, a terrible movie to end this Rocky saga.
Thank goodness that this is not Rocky's last film, as this film doesn't represent the entire legacy of this fantastic franchise",Rocky V

164,Izzit249,Could've been better! He was supposed to die!,4,18 May 2004,"Spoiler Alert I have to say that when I first saw the movies Rocky 1-3, I was in bliss. The story's were brill. Something that made you never want to see the end of it, went away wishing the film had another half hour left or so. Rocky 4 was 50/50. Stallone wanted to make a movie about change, hardly see any change apart from the gloryhunter fans at the end going from Drago's to Rocky's! Dunno why they had to kill Apollo off, could've just sidelined him with injury or something, but in my view the pace and energy of the fight made up for it, and one more thing, no mention of Mickey??? Apart from the flashback sequence. And then, Rocky V. Another Rocky is always a pleasure in my view, but the movie could've been better! Stallone stated that originally Rocky was supposed to die in his last fight with tommy gunn, but changed weeks prior to production, claiming the film is about recovering from a disaster, which is a great plot to go by, but why did he have to have a street fight? I like the idea of the sadness that he ignored his son by paying loads of attention to Tommy, then tommy went awol with george duke, but at least he could have had Apollo or Creed's manager(I forget the name) train him for one last fight in the ring, and then beats tommy gunn, wins the title, and wins back his fortune. Or even he died in the ring after he beat him, and had millions cheer him on or mourn him as he went. Rocky VI???? nnnnnnoooooo! sly's too old, fat, slow and lost his talent in writing. 5 is enough. His career's going down the crap shoot, he should just relive his past glory and call it day. Oh yeah, the actor who plays Gunn should've been the one who really retired! haha.",Rocky V
165,Izzit249,"Why Rocky VI would be a predictable storyline, and rubbish! (Tiny spoiler to previous films enclosed.)",4,29 June 2004,"Where would Rocky VI start? He's been training his son to fight and has become as respectable as his dad, but he meets an opponent who is seemingly indestructible (The return of Ivan Drago?), who therefore murders his son or does a case of GBH on him in the ring, so out of guilt he tries to commit suicide, but Adrian stops him and convinces him to fight having had a dream about her son after his death telling her he has to avenge him, by fighting one last time, and ends where liver disease finally catches up with Paulie and kicks the bucket by finally drinking himself to death, but says a heart felt sorry to Adrian b4 he does?? And lets face it, a popular face would play Rocky's opponent, The Rock? Vin Diesel? The film would maybe be good if Dolph Lungren strutted his stuff once more.Stallone admitted on the Video Commentary to the Rocky 25th Anniversary DVD that he will never have the ability to write another film with the same hungry heart that went into Rocky.Rocky V was a calamity on so many levels. Stallone looked older and knackered (he looked better in demolition man), as if he couldn't give a care about the film, referring back to the previous films to get a boost was a sad and cheesy way to gain audience attention and who really cared about Tommy Gunn? Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, Ivan Drago, were ones the audiences attention would be focused on as much as Rocky would be, because they were a threat to him, a threat to Rocky's success. Tommy Gunn was no threat, he was exactly what the press in the film said, he's Rocky's robot, Rocky taught him, what chance did he stand?? Yeah Rock was brain damaged, but he taught the kid most of what he knows. In one word, Predictable.Reffering back to the old chapel, old streets of Philadelphia (spelling?), Mickey, the infamous run up the steps and thru the streets, showed Stallone was out of ideas, or he was lacking enthusiasm for the film. Rocky IV was great because it was fresh and new, something we hadn't seen before, Apollo vs Drago, an exciting main character of the film taking the stage instead of Rock for a short while, a side of rock we hadn't seen before, not really paying attention to Adrian, showing he could have done it without her words of wisdom like we'd seen in the previous two, and Dolph Lungren looked pure!Some advice to Stallone, leave it alone!....",Rocky V
166,muzical-96828,You knocked him down now why don't you try knockin' me down,8,23 July 2021,Rocky 5 is a great addition to the series. Stallone actually showed some acting chops especially when he first starts training Tommy. You can really feel his excitement. The scene at the old gym is a tear jerker. The street fight is just what we needed. I'm glad they didn't take the easy route and have Rocky train and fight in the ring again. A creative and entertaining movie for any fan of Rocky!!,Rocky V
167,guardkid,Disastrous end to the series,4,16 April 2000,"This was such an awful Rocky movie. Rocky returning to where he began and wearing the same old clothes as in the original - oh dear. A tacky promoter who was a blatant Don King rip-off raving on about his fighter ""Union Kane."" That name made me laugh at this garbage of a film - one of many laughs I should add. Rocky V should never have been made in the first place and that sound-byte ""Go For It"" - ultra cheesy.",Rocky V
168,AMovieEnthusiast,Another masterfully told tale from Stallone,10,20 September 2018,"I'd say this film has more depth than 3 and possibly 4, in my opinion.
So we start our story with the champ losing all of his money because of a bad investment decision from Paulie. He moves back to the ghetto where it all began (they made it look great and run down). He is left with a little bit of money left after he liquidated his assets and cars. He is faced with the decision of keeping his health and brain or keep fighting.
He chooses to train an up and coming boxer. He invests all of his time into him all the while ignoring his son who is facing issues since moving into Philly and attending the public school. So this story is more about family and priorities in life more than anything. Eventually he gets abandoned by Tommy when he starts working for the sleazy promoters who were harassing Rocky. Tommy didn't want to take the long route, he wanted the quick route to money and fame. The promoters didn't have Rocky's health at interest. They only wanted money and thought money could satisfy Rocky. But with brain damage, what is money? He wouldn't have been able to raise his son. Rocky begins to bond with his son a bit and we can see their relationship beginning to go back where it used to be, a 'hometeam'. I think the street argument scene with Adrian is one of the best and touching scenes in the film; It shows how Adrian grounds Rocky and will always be there no matter his success or health.
The final fight is great, you basically have Rocky giving it to this loud, obnoxious, unclassy kid who thinks he is better than him because he has money and has won a few fights. Tommy will never have the class and heart that Rocky and Mickey did. Tommy is like the new breed of fighters, loud but no heart.
The plot is simple but Stallone manages to make it emotionally charged and makes us care about the characters. Very humanizing film.",Rocky V
169,Joe-290,Not as bad as a lot of people say,6,7 January 2000,"This movies which has to come in its title number is the fifth best of the Rocky films. It has not got the same power as the first 2 but is still very emotionally tought and strong and sends across a message like the other movies. Stallone like he always has been is great with the part. The script really does have its moments of splendour and with sadness. Scenes such as Balboas recolections on the past and his time with his friend and coach Mickey. Extremely emotional movie but of course only in scene such as that and also when his wife tries to pur across he devoted love for the boxer. Its powerfuls and tought like the whole series is. The films are the most realistic film series based on true life. True griet. True feelings and love. Now, Rocky loses his money plus gets brain damage, just how bad can a life get. Now not been able to box becomes a coach but soon gets betrayed by his student as another promoter with more money and power takes control of him and leaves Rocky all alone with nowhere to go.Although there is no ring fight, do not worry as there is a more personel than ever with more strenght and skill in a tough and rough and mean street fight. Definatley the least best in the series but still not bad and not as bad as what people say as it does contain all life based aspects. Very good and absolutley worth a watch more times than the very bad Star Wars.",Rocky V
170,drgibson,Not worth seeing,2,7 February 2002,"I love the first four Rocky films but Rocky V is a mess. The plot is dishonest. You have to believe that a multi-millionaire couple like Rocky and Adrian would allow a loser like Paulie to have control over their finances. Never would happen. Then, you have to believe that if Rocky went broke, no advertisers would touch him because of a few youthful indiscretions. This, after he has been champ twice over the course of several years and just defeated a Russian champ in a fight seen by the entire world! He could have made millions with one commercial. After these two dishonest plot twists, it's impossible to take the rest of the film seriously. That's too bad, because a plot involving a still wealthy, retired, slightly punchy Rocky trying to guide a young prospect to the top would have been interesting.",Rocky V
171,LaserPoint,Important movie to the series,9,3 April 2008,"I don't know what people have agienst it maybe its the end fight or the fact that his poor and living low again, part 5 is truly a important edition to the Rocky series, sure its different from 2-5 but thats what makes it so great, it links back to the original more then what the other films do. Yes there are some faults to it like the brain damage which I think was a bad idea and so did Sly so he ignores this in Balboa, Rocky also got sucked in to easy to Tommy Gunn and at times just wanted his son to leave and not deal with his problems which was also a bad idea, but apart from that it was truly a great movie and as I said important to the series, even in Balboa there's a couple of link-backs to Rocky V, Rocky is still living low and the home team quote which was introduced in Rocky V. If you haven't seen it for yourself and judge this movie on what others think I suggest you rent or buy a copy and if you are like me, you will LOVE IT.",Rocky V
172,briandoodo,Only for people that Understand Rocky especially post Creed and Creed II,9,4 August 2021,"The first Rocky movie wasn't fantastical, it wasn't an action film, didn't have SCIFI elements. It was before Stallone was an action star , compared to Arnold. It was a film about a underdog boxer who lived on the streets and never got a chance to take his shot...It was a very real story that Stallone wrote himself, and it was actually inspired in part to Stallone's real life story. Stallone himself wasn't doing well when he wrote Rocky...he wasn't a star, he was no one... Just like Rocky...Butkus was actually Stallone's dog who he had to give up because he was so poor, and then he was able to buy Butkus back.Stallone continued to write and direct the entire series after Rocky 1. As it went on some movies became more fantastical and over the top. Rocky V goes back to the heart of Rocky and it's really only for people who understand what Rocky is.It's not about boxing in the ring. It's more of an allegory for your own struggles, and the struggles of everyone around the world. You can't have a Rocky film without inspirational speeches, motivational speeches and pearls of wisdom... these messages are not to be overlooked, they are the core of a Rocky film...It's not about boxing in a ring as much as it is fighting for what you believe in.Rocky is a real character, he's meant to be relatable, he wins, he loses, he gets knocked down, he gets back up. He's literally meant to embody a part of all of us at sometime in our lives. He tastes success, he enjoys it, it goes to his head, he loses everything, he becomes humble, he becomes wiser...If you don't watch this series like it's an evolving character with a real story, real struggles...then you don't understand the Rocky universe. If you think that the character learns in the ring, or grows in the ring or that his fights or struggles are all in the ring then you really don't understand anything about these movies. Most of what Rocky endures happens out side of the ring... the fights in the ring...It's a drama... what happens in the ring is just a way to illustrate that, it's condensed into an allegory so that you can visualize and understand the struggle.Rocky was never about BOXING or even winning. In the first movie he DOESN'T win and it didn't matter. It wasn't about an action star being the hero. It was about a man giving his best effort, to do the best he can in life. That's what life is about, ""It aint about how hard you can hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forwards..."" The first movie wasn't about being in the ring or a champion. It was about Rocky proving to himself that he could take the abuse and could go the distance... Again, this had a much more sophisticated message tied into the film's narrative than "" Rocky is a fighter""...Rocky movies do not actually have anything to do with the boxing ring... they never do, there is always a deeper message that is the real backbone of the film...Stallone didn't write these as one dimensional beat up action films. Rocky is a much deeper character than that.. Rocky V is a great movie , especially in the context of the entire series... I do include the two creed films as rocky films because they add to that universe and give it closure. Stallone also helped write those 2 films.Real fans of Rocky who understand the character and take away it's the profundity of the franchise should have no trouble enjoying this film especially in the context of what comes after and even before. You see Rocky as a very rounded individual, who has had ups and downs and who can relate to characters like Adonis Creed. You can see how time and experience has matured Rocky and made him wiser. In the later films you see that Rocky has a lot to offer other people even outside of the ring.This film is grossly misunderstand, underrated and is a fantastic addition to the series. The pacing can be a little off at times but over all, it's no where near as bad as people like to think and it's every bit a Rocky movie that it could be. I never understood the hatred for it because at it's core it has a lot of Rocky-isms that the later films in the franchise even pay homage to... (I think Stallone is afraid to admit that he did enjoy this film and that some of it was dear to him...) Creed 1, 2 and Rocky Balboa all have references to this movie or pay it some homage...At this point the entire franchise has been tied together in a beautiful, wonderful way. In light of Creed 1 and 2 it even feels more holistic.",Rocky V
173,bryanross1985,Thank god for Rocky Balboa,2,15 March 2009,"Being a kid in the 90s, the Rocky films have a special place in my heart. I remember in 1996, Rocky 1-4 were shown on consecutive days on TV. I was not aware that Rocky 5 existed until I bought the box set in 2002.I watched Rocky (9/10), Rocky 2 (9/10), Rocky 3 (8/10) and Rocky 4 (9/10) back to back and with great anticipation I placed the Rocky 5 disc into the DVD player.When the movie finished, I thought to myself: ""what the hell was that?"" I expected it to follow the formula of the previous rocky films (the montage, big fight at the end etc) and thought that that was the problem. I watched it the next day and had that same feeling again.Rocky 5 has the ""dodgy sequel effect"" on the previous films in that their quality is diminished by the fact that Rocky, our hero whom we look up to and admire for his iron chin and unbreakable spirit has been reduced to a broken down man who trains some punk kid and ignores his own kids in turn.This is not the Rocky we know and love, this is a derivative piece of junk that is detested by fans (both hardcore and casual). It is a waste of a film. The only reason that this has a 2/10 and not a 1/10 is that the fight at the end is pretty well choreographed.However. You lucky people who have not seen any Rocky films and are considering purchasing the Rocky box set have the option of not watching this and instead watching the vastly superior Rocky Balboa instead.Note to Stallone, Still waiting for the following films from you: Rocky 7, another Rambo and Copland 2.

The first mistake, if u ask me, was to put the fight in the street. That stole the essence of the movie. The family side of Rocky has been etched out well, especially the father son relation. but the teacher-student relation was poorly shown. As against the other rockies, the film went wayward in the script department. Rocky I was realistic, but gradually in II, III, and IV that aspect waned and in this installment, there is not a bit of realism. But then, its not devoid of any pluses. The music has been great, especially the final song. Stallone has done a decent job. So if you are a Stallone fan, then you can have a look.

The family go and live back in the old neighborhood.Rocky for a living opens up Micheys old gym,Adrian gets her old job at the pet shop and Robert(Rockys son),has to adapt to a complete different scenery:from the rich world and high class education,to a poor degraded environment comparable in way to a ghetto. A long the way Rocky becomes manager of Tommy""the machine""Gunn,an ungrateful prick who after been tough how to box at the highest level,seeing that Rocky hasn't got the financial muscle to move him up and lamenting that after 22 consecutive wins,no proper money has been made,Tommy decides to turn his back on him by joining the ranks of a bent promoter by the name of George W.Duke. The final sequence of the film sees Rocky and Tommy fighting in the street,thankfully Rocky ends up victorious by showing his ex pupil some manners and who is the best.The whole Rocky series,especially this fifth chapter, is not based on boxing,but it narrates the story of a man who even when he finds himself in most dark and difficult situations in life,he manages to stand up on his two feet and fight until the very end. Especially with Rocky 5,Sly Stallone wanted to point out a clear message,In life even with unfortunate situations such as ""bankruptcy"",failiures,disappointments,get put down by other peoples criticisms,judgments and bad words,don't just lay down as a defeated, Get up and always find the strength to react and confront.You gain and posses that strength from the love and careness that you have for your family.Never marginalize your family for someone from the outside,family comes first than power,money,and material.I honestly don't understand why this movie got such a low rating and why its considered to be the weakest and one of the worst.The movie other than being emotional and more based on reality,is Original.To all those IMDb users that gave this picture such a low rating,claiming that it should be burned and its a disgrace are ignorants that don't understand a monkeys toss about cinema.Everyone wanted to witness Rocky climb back in the ring and fight another vicious killing machine like Drago,but it didn't happen.UNLUCKY!!!!to all the haters,a word of advice:do something better with your time instead of reviewing titles that you don't completely understand.!the ending of the film is absolutely perfect,where the scene closes with the Rocky statue ,with its arms high up in the sky,looking over the entire city of Philadelfia as a symbol of victory. All five Rocky films have had an impact on my life.I want to personally thank Mr Slyvester Stallone for delivering not only such superb films but mostly creating such a legendary figure like ""Rocky"", that will always be remembered in the long coming, a character that we always can turn to,especially moments we are in need of comfort,strength and a boost.... but most of all, AN IDOL THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF!!!!!

This breaks from the traditional Rocky formula and bring us to a more down to earth depiction of the life of an aging athlete. There is a lot of Family drama, heart warming scenes and also some good old life lessons. If they wanted to make a soulless sequel, they just had to invent another big bad rival to challenge Rocky in a big climax for the tittle. However, they instead took the risk to make something different, and (even though that by itself doesn't make a great movie), in my opinion, the result was something that enriched the character and story of the previous films. It makes them feel more real.

182,jman_316,Go for what?,3,11 June 2007,"I stumbled upon this movie quite early this morning (which is probably the only time when this movie airs). I had never seen this ""Rocky"", only hearing and reading that it was absolutely awful. Well, everyone was right. There are so many things wrong with this movie, guess I might at well start near the beginning.Adrian (Talia Shire) and Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) find out that Adrian's brother and Rocky's hanger-on Paulie (Burt Young) signed the Balboa fortune over to a crooked account. Problem #1: Stallone never portrayed Rocky at the brightest bulb in the box, but we're supposed to believe both he and Adrian gave a drunk power of attorney? The Balboas lose everything, have to sell off almost everything, and move back to the slums of Philadelphia. Rocky takes a job working as a trainer in his old gym and Adrian has to work, also. Rocky's son Robert (a.k.a. Rocky Jr. whom Rocky Sr. refers to as ""kid"", played by Sly's real-life son Sage) has to go to a difficult public school where he is repeatedly mugged and has his jacket and lunch money stolen. Eventually, Rocky is befriended by a young boxer named Tommy Gunn (actual boxer Tommy Morrison, sporting a very unflattering mullet) who asks Rocky to take him under his wing. While training Tommy, Rocky Sr. ignores Rocky Jr. who starts to distance himself from his father.Rocky is frequently accosted by promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant), who is a blatant ripoff of Don King, even using King's catchphrase ""Only in America."" King, er, Duke, tries to get Rocky back in the ring to fight one of his fighters, but Rocky announced his retirement (again) at the beginning of the film. Somehow, Duke got a hold of Rocky's medical records (which were supposedly confidential) showing Rocky has suffered brain damage. He repeatedly tries to lure Rocky back into the ring, but voice of reason Adrian refuses to let him. Unable to get Rocky, Duke wines and dines Rocky's prized pupil Gunn. Gunn eventually accepts an offer to join Duke's team. Rocky accuses him of ""selling out"" but Gunn has had it with Rocky and his refusal to get him a title shot. By this point, Adrian snaps Rocky out of his haze by telling him he's lost his son. Rocky Sr. and Rocky Jr. eventually make nice and start up their ""home team"" (whatever that means) thing again. Previous to this, Sr. taught Jr. how to defend himself and Jr. takes out one of the bullies.Gunn eventually defeats the champ, but the crowd turns on him for leaving Balboa. At a post-fight press conference, the media says Gunn beat a bum and he'll never be as good as Rocky. An incensed Gunn storms out of the press conference and goes to to the slums of Philly with Duke in tow to challenge Rocky to a fight. Rocky refuses until Gunn punches Paulie who was popping off to Gunn. Duke wants the fight ""in the ring"" but Rocky tells him ""My ring's outside."" Rocky and Gunn engage in a street fight with cameramen and reporters following the action (man, talk about good timing). Rocky Jr. is watching TV and tells Adrian that Dad is fighting. The two then head to the scene. The fight ends with Rocky scoring the victory. Afterwards, Rocky confronts Duke who says to Rocky three times ""Touch me and I'll sue."" Rocky disregards his warning and gives him a body blow that knocks him four feet into the air (??) onto a parked car. Rocky then says to him, ""Sue me for what?"" Other problems with this movie: 1) All the stuff that the Balboas sold couldn't even get them a modest apartment in a decent neighborhood? 2) After defending himself and getting his jacket back, Jr. and the bully shake hands and later Jr. becomes friends with the other bully. Nice to see there's no hard feelings.3) How on earth did Adrian and Jr. get to the street fight in about two minutes? Man, Adrian must've really hauled.4) After distancing himself from his father, Rocky Jr.'s grammar takes a nosedive. Apparently becoming tough means suddenly saying things ""don't mean nothing'."" In closing, Stallone was clearly trying to re-create the first Rocky (even having Rocky start wearing his old top hat and leather jacket again, along with resuming smoking) but he falls well short. The only redeeming qualities in this movie are a couple funny lines, Rocky's nemesis not being a caricature, and the ""One more round"" line which is one of the most memorable lines from the Rocky genre.Take a pass on this dog. While I haven't seen ""Rocky Balboa"" yet, it can't be worse than this disaster.",Rocky V
183,lcrews,One of the worst films of the 90s,2,14 December 2003,"The Rocky series proves the Law of Diminishing Returns: each sequel only gets worse and worse.  Rocky IV was hardly even a movie, but more a long series of music videos. Rocky V is the last insult, an unpleasant and implausible return to Rocky's ""roots.""  All of the characters have been stripped of their good virtues.  Instead of Rocky being endearingly dumb, he's now gratingly dumb; instead of Adrian being the silent but strong one, she's annoyingly shrill. As far as the new characters, Tommy Morrison has all the charisma of a leaky toilet.  And don't even get me started on the ersatz Don King character!    Rocky's quick riches-to-rags story is so incredibly unbelievable.  It's one thing to return Rocky to the setting of the first film, but you've got to wonder what made Stallone and Avlidsen think the fans would enjoy seeing the Balboas living in total squalor and ignorance.  Like this would have ever happened anyway.  Even in the pre-VH1 and E! days, Rocky could have stayed out of the poorhouse by selling his story to news and entertainment outlets.This is just the tip of the iceberg in a film that asks the viewer to make so many leaps of faith (Rocky Jr. aged 10 years while Rocky was in the USSR?).  Even if you can make these concessions, the story that remains is so very unpleasant.  It's obvious they wanted to make it ""gritty"" like the first one, but by 1990 Stallone and Avildsen had none of the heart and soul that made the series work in the first place.",Rocky V
184,pkanzow,"Not that bad, but ugly plot holes",7,6 January 2007,"I think the worst plot hole of this movie is, how can a superstar like Rocky even after losing his money become so poor that he has to live in his old, slum-like neighborhood again? And live in conditions where a dollar is a problem? He does not do advertising? Hello? He did that well in part III and now he rather fights with serious health risks than signing up for a few commecrials to buy new furniture to replace the shabby stuff they live in? Unrealistic.But I still liked the movie. It shows the importance of values. Money vs family, and the latter is the stronger, and that is not a bad teaching.For me, it is a little like Star Trek V, which is also seen as the worst of its series: It is better the movie exists than not, it has its moments, it delivers a great soundtrack, and at least, it features a hero I can't get enough of.7 of 10.",Rocky V
185,skelyrata,Rocky V connects perfectly with the first Rocky movie,10,23 July 2015,"I saw Rocky V recently and I enjoyed it as much as I did when I first saw it in 1990. In fact I considered Rocky V the perfect ending for the Rocky saga. The next chapter, Rocky Balboa, was OK, but for me it was mostly nostalgia and it didn't generate any emotions in me. But Rocky V Wow! That movie hit all my emotions. Rocky V broke the formula. Our hero loses all his money and has to go back to the neighborhood. Ashamed and humiliated. Of course he is traumatized! Doctors told him he had brain damage and he couldn't fight his way out of this problem. He was on denial and he wanted to get it all back. So when Tommy Gun shows up, he sees an opportunity. An opportunity that was stolen by the Duke. At the end of the movie, Rocky didn't get what he wanted. He failed. It is rare to see an American movie where the hero fails. Rocky didn't get what he wanted, he got what he needed. Personal respect. By beating Tommy Gun on that amazing street fight Rocky became again the people's champion. Here is where Rocky V makes a perfect loop with the first Rocky movie. In that film it is established that Rocky's motivation to fight Apollo is not money or to be the champion of the world. He just wanted to go the distance with Creed to prove to himself the he wasn't another bump from the neighborhood. It is a personal victory. In fact, when the fight ends Rocky tells Apollo he doesn't need a rematch. In Rocky V Adrian establishes that the difference between Rocky and Tommy is that Rocky always fought with his heart. Money and the championship were secondary. Passion drove Rocky through his carrier. But Tommy was hungry for money, the title and glamor. The Duke said it perfect: ""Hey Rock, you have more class than him!"" This are the main reasons why I love Rocky V.",Rocky V

I don't even count watching this one because it is so bad and dumb. The story basically is about Rocky retiring (again), and him, Adrian, Paulie and Rocky Junior have all lost there house, so they must live in Paulie's old house, in a rough area. The movie basically has nothing to do with Rocky, and mostly about his son. It is so boring, and your waiting for something to happen, but no, nothing happens. Tommy Gunn comes up to Rocky and Rocky doesn't give him an autograph (or something, I can't really remember how the met) so he gets all angry and in the end they have a fight, but not in the ring.

It really disappointed me, as I felt it tried too hard to recreate the first film (and parts of the others), and failed completely. Due to financial issues, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) basically is back to the life he had in the first film. He has retired from boxing due to brain damage and takes a new young fighter (Tommy Morrison) under his wing, who then turns against him. Most of this film seemed familiar to me, and it's because it deliberately tries to retread parts of all the previous films. Also, the acting in this film is the worst in the series, and I felt it to be the first and only time Stallone was bad as Rocky. You can tell that this was originally meant to be the final film, and to end with only a street fight and Rocky still being bankrupt is not a satisfying way to end the series.

Yes, for personal camp value!",8,7 February 2005,"I might be biased because this was my favorite movie as an eleven-year-old (it even spawned a crush on boxer/actor Tommy Morrison)and brings those childhood memories rushing back each time I watch it. But ""Rocky 5"" happens to be my favorite of the Rocky movies ... that I have seen. Granted, I still have yet to watch the original, but none of the second, third, or fourth Rockys had the heart and actual story (albeit a cheesy one) that ""Rocky 5"" has.""Rocky 5"" is directed by the same man who made the first Rocky movie (John G. Avildsen) and stars Sylvester Stallone (you're kidding!), as now ex-boxer Rocky Balboa. Rocky damaged his brain in his previous adventure, so this film has him in retirement mode. Unfortunately, Rocky's brother-in-law Paulie (the reliable Burt Young) has also managed to inadvertently swindle Rocky out of his money. Nevertheless, Rocky takes his wife Adrienne (Talia Shire), son Robert (Stallone's real life son Sage; who was a young boy in ""Rocky 4"", but is suddenly about 13 in this one, despite the time passage of a month or two, tops), and even hapless Paulie and moves them to the rough streets of Philadelphia -- his hometown -- so that they may start a new, peaceful life.Then trouble comes along in the form of young Oklahoma boxer Tommy Gunn (real-life boxer Morrison), who had been more or less stalking his hero, Rocky. Tommy casually meets up with Rocky and asks to stay with him in his home and learn from him. Rock's more than happy to oblige when he sees the boxer's talent. Soon Rocky is caught up in managing this boxer, and keeping his own talent and image up through Tommy (ignoring his jealous son in the process). But some bad guys, led by an ersatz Don King character named Richard Gant, and who can offer Tommy more money than Rocky (plus a red-headed bimbo!)... notice Tommy too, and persuade him to join up with them. Tommy is naive and confused, but he finally does join forces with the Bad Guys. This wounds Rocky's soul. Still, he keeps his faith in the youngster until Tommy commits the ""never-been-done"" act of saying (on national television) he has someone to thank ... then pausing, leaving Rocky sure Tommy is going to say his name ... and then, of course, thanking Ersatz Don King instead. Finally Rocky fights his last battle, against Tommy. This climactic scene is perhaps the most entertaining one in the entire movie, courtesy of Ersatz Don King! (""Touch me, and I'll sue you!"", he warns Rocky.) The action scenes are well done. The acting isn't too bad either-- I'm no Stallone fan, but he's good with the Rocky character, and Morrison gives a fairly auspicious acting debut, considering. Fans of the original Rocky might not think this fifth chapter of his tale does the character justice, but I think many will find this watchable in a campy, guilty-pleasure sort of way.",Rocky V
193,jonnyabomb,Give it a chance.,7,15 April 2006,"For some reason or another, certain movies achieve a reputation as being worse than they actually are. Rocky V is one such film that is affected by the  as I call it  Phantom Menace syndrome. This refers to Movies that are interesting in their own way but fail to live up to the hype or expectation of previous instalments, or simply do not follow the formula that everyone derided for being too predictable anyway. For me, Rocky V is the best of the sequels to the 1976 original, as it does not follow in the Rocky tradition of simply having a bigger guy to fight than in the previous film. Rocky IV was a great spectacle but it was more comical than anything to think that an entire Russian government could be funding one over-sized boxer who could kill a man with one flurry of punches, not to mention turn a blind eye to illegal doping. The fifth instalment in the anthology goes back to the more personal story of the character, and deals much more realistically with the aftermath of loss and the twisted nature of professional prize fighting.Stallone recruited his own son for the role of Robert (Rocky's son) and the result is one of the best father son relationships ever committed to celluloid. The scene where Rocky realises that he has been a negligent father and must make his peace with the boy is affectionate and heartfelt and could never been as realistic without the real life history behind these two people.OK, there are some flaws and I am not too naive to suggest this movie is worthy of an Oscar. The casting of Tommy 'The Machine' Gunn could have been better as real life boxer Tommy Morrison sometimes appears wooden and is never really threatening enough to Rocky for the final fight to have any tangible tension. Similarly, aside from the final tune of Elton John's 'The measure of a man' the music does not measure up to the awesome and inspirational anthems that have accompanied previous instalments. Any Flick in the early nineties that used rap music as its primary soundtrack has ultimately dated for a modern audience.My advice would be to watch this movie in full before you judge it. There are some sad moments in this fall from grace story as well as few goofs in terms of weak acting. But it's not as bad as people say and as the sixth instalment nears completion it's about time everyone got back into the Rocky spirit for one more round.A good film. 7/10",Rocky V

For one thing Rocky really sounds like he's got brain damage in this one, however in fairness he did just takes some extremely hard shots from Ivan Drago....Although I'm glad that Rocky's character didn't die at the end as was the original intention, it's the very reason that the final street brawl didn't work. It does show a lot of heart and sensitivity from Stallone however. It's not so much a movie about boxing as it is a story about a father and a son facing the crises of life together and thereby becoming closer.

197,eyesmalloy,Rocky V: Different Doesn't Always Mean Bad,6,10 January 2015,"Rocky fans are sharply divided when it comes to this fifth and almost last installment in the Rocky franchise, many considering it the lowest point in the series. Whether it is or not, it's certainly the most unique. The story is not so focused on Rocky himself, but split between Rocky, the troubles of his son, and the rise of his protégé Tommy Gunn. That splintering as well as the change in format and the street fight ending are the biggest issues fans have with Rocky V. And of course, Tommy's mullet.When people fall in love with a film, or film series, the last thing they want is something different. Most filmgoers want to see the same thing over and over with only very modest changes in characterization and story. Rocky through Rocky IV all had roughly the same storyline: Rocky wants to quit fighting, someone convinces him to fight, he trains hard, and finally he dukes it out in the ring with a bigger, stronger, larger-than-life opponent. Sometimes he wins, sometimes he loses. This is the Rocky film fans were used to seeing. Rocky V takes a new road entirely and shows our hero in a very different light.Adrian's brother Paulie is definitely the antithesis of Rocky in the films. He mistreats Adrian, drinks like a fish, and at times shows extreme jealousy and aggression toward Rocky. At the beginning of Rocky V, Paulie tops all past shenanigans by gambling away Rocky's fortune, forcing the family to return to the dingy, crime-riddled Philadelphia neighborhood where they started. Why does Rocky keep putting up with Paulie's bad behavior? We all love Rocky in part because his heart is bigger than his brain, but this time around the Italian Stallion seems denser than usual. While it is explained early on that Rocky has actually suffered some permanent brain damage, he is a little too oblivious here.During most of Rocky V, we just want to smack Rocky across the face and tell him to wake the heck up. We can sort of understand why he keeps Paulie under his roof despite his costly blunder, but what follows is nothing less than a string of bad decisions by a Rocky who's clearly asleep at the wheel. He ignores his son's obvious need for attention and guidance, he takes an ungrateful punk under his wing and lives vicariously through him, and he allows a slimy Don King-like boxing promoter walk all over him. Adrian, meanwhile, is wide awake but her repeated attempts to shake Rocky out of his fantasy are in vain because he just won't listen.Probably the biggest complaint of Rocky V is the ending. All of the other five Rocky films spend their final fifteen minutes in the ring. Not this one. Instead, Rocky's former protégé Tommy challenges him to a bare-knuckle fist fight on the street. Since Tommy is technically the heavyweight champion now, and because the fight is relatively short and doesn't take place in the ring, it does feel a bit unofficial. It makes sense that the audience would want to see Rocky retain his title one last time and that doesn't happen. Furthermore, the film's closing credits are superimposed over a slideshow of memorable moments from the entire series, making it feel even more final.Having said all of this, the truth is that Rocky V is still a pretty good movie. It may have some frustrating, even awkward scenes, but it's packed with real emotion and is generally well made. The best news of course is that Rocky V isn't the end anyway. Stallone wisely decided to make another film sixteen years later - the surprisingly great Rocky Balboa - which closely mimics the original and gives this spectacular series the ending it deserves.I love the Rocky movies. Having recently bought the Heavyweight Collection on Blu-ray and watched them chronologically, I have nothing but respect for Stallone and love for his alter-ego. Each entry in the Rocky series is a worthy chapter and none of them stray too far from their origins. From that perspective, I'd go so far as to say the Rocky series is probably the most consistently good film series ever made. Every series has its black sheep and Rocky V is certainly that.

The only slight downside is that this street brawl at night could not possibly have the same dramatic tension & triumph as a professional boxing match.4. The sleaziness of some boxing promoters, as personified by George Washingoton Duke.I admit: I felt that the plot device of having Paulie accidentally lose all of Rocky's & Adrian's assets by giving some lawyer or accountant full power of attorney felt very contrived and very inconsistent with the streetwise smarts of the character Paulie.But this plot silliness was nowhere near enough to damage the overall drama of the movie.",Rocky V

I'll never forget how thrilled and excited the whole audience felt when leaving the theater.A few years later when Rocky II came out, the charm and emotion was still there and it was a pretty good sequel. But the problem with it was it was too predictable. You knew before the movie began that Rocky would win this time or else why would they bother to make a sequel in the first place? Rocky III was a good adrenaline pumper and served as a good promotional movie for Survivor's new album as well as a launching pad for Hulk Hogan's and Mr.T's careers. But the problem with it was Rocky's character is so far removed from the one we grew to love. He is no longer the 2nd rate underdog boxer or the ""wise guy"" street tough who lives in squalor. He's now a rich classy celebrity type figure who speaks articulately and now has an iron jaw and can take a thousands punches that should have rendered him unconscious.Rocky IV was a clear indication that the series had gone way too far. Although a good popcorn movie, it was still pretty lame. The movie was more like an hour and a half long MTV video. Way too many songs, montages, and dragged out training scenes that served as fillers in lieu of an actual script and the idea of a boxer turned world peace negotiator was just cringe worthy.And finally, Rocky V was just all around bad. Rocky losing his fortune and moving back to the Philadelphia streets was an obvious attempt to recapture the charm of the original. But unfortunately, it fell way short. The movie was more like a ""Daddy's not paying enough attention to me"" soap opera that focused too much on Rocky's dorky and unlikeable son who's daddy is too busy training his new protégé Tommy Gunn and is constantly hounded by the Don King type character Duke to get back in the ring.

Okay, there are a few flaws such as the way in which Rocky loses his fortune is unconvincing; a few scenes such as the press conference following Rocky's return from Moscow could have been tighter; the fight scene at the end is a little anti-climatic.However, there are some great things about the film too: the opening & closing credits for one; the references to earlier films including the Mickey flashbacks; the whole 'back to the streets' scenario. 'Rocky Balboa' picks up on some of the threads from Rocky 5, notably the father-son relationship.

204,jlivesay2010,This movie is really underrated,8,9 March 2009,This movie I know people did not really enjoy. But in a way it is underrated. Because it does really get Mickey back in the show (which Rocky IV stayed away from). I got sad towards the beginning when Rocky goes back to the old neighborhood one night and goes to Mickey's gym and at the end when Rocky is thinking back to what Mickey was telling him in the first two. It also really does have a father son theme in it. I felt sorry for his son. Tommy Morrison did a good job in playing his character. All the Rocky movies to me are the same because they all have there specialties. So yea in a way this movie is underrated and actually really sad.,Rocky V
205,sonofjorel316,Unfairly overlooked in the Rocky Series.,8,6 March 2013,"Rocky V is deemed to be the worst film of the series and Stallone himself gave it a 1 rating in an interview here in the U.K with Jonathan Ross.Whilst i understand Stallone's frustration with how the Rocky saga ended at the time. Rocky V is not a viewing experience without it's rewards.Rocky's trip down memory lane to an empty Mickey's gym has to one of the standout scenes in the entire series and whilst the writing isn't on par with Rocky or even Rocky Balboa, you get the sense that Rocky V is back to basics and this is how it life would be if Rocky was a real everyday person and shows the struggles of how he and his family have to adjust everyday life, and how Rocky struggles to reclaim the life he once had, and the father/son relationship that deteriorates, due to Rocky spending all his time trying to live his life through his new protégé.Whilst the eventual climatic final street fight between teacher and trainer might not be on a Drago or Creed level, you still find yourself rooting for Rocky and hoping he can fix what he has unknowingly broken.Ignore all the reviews that it's poor continuation of the Rocky saga. It tries to get back to basics and for the most part succeeds.My advice, give it a chance.",Rocky V

207,d_kittle,Really-NOT BAD!!!!,8,21 December 2006,"OK, this is another Rocky movie using the standard formula, but it still strikes a chord. The story resonated with me, as it is representative of how decent people will devote time and energy to jobs, or outside influences that do not deserve it. There are important family issues addressed, and I think that is valuable as well. While this particular movie might not be the best in the genre, it still evokes a lump in the throat, and is easy to watch. I think that many of the reviewers were a bit harsh in their assessments. This movie represents a part of the story of Rocky Balboa, and contains interesting psychological commentary. It is possible that the values that are represented in this film were not fully appreciated in the 90's, but that are becoming more significant in the turbulent times of today. Perhaps Sylvester Stallone's timeless message about the importance of ""family"" needs to be heard again. This movie is well worth your time, at least once.",Rocky V

210,Schenkenberg112,Underrated Rocky's battle,6,16 May 2021,"'Rocky V' 'Rocky V' is the most overlooked and criminally underrated in the franchise. Probably because it was too 'boring', too grounded compared to the other sequels that grew bigger, louder, and flashier movie after movie. With that 'Rocky V' is much closer to the first movie and it would have been a poignant conclusion to the story about a fighter who rose from the bottom and rocketed into the stratosphere of fame and glory. It also takes a more in-depth glance into the dark side of the business of the boxing world.'Rocky V' sets in right after the Balboa-Drago bout. Rocky is experiencing physical complications from the fight. Hardest ones he ever had during his career. Doctors declare that his fighting days are over and Rocky reluctantly retires. After Paulie's mistake at mishandling financial documents which leave the Balboa family without their money, they must move back into the old neighborhood. Rocky tries to deal with the end of his career and changed the environment. He re-opens Mickey's old gym and starts to work as a trainer. One day a young boxer shows up at the door - Tommy Gunn, an admirer of Rocky. Meanwhile, a boxing promoter George Washington Duke keeps hounding Rocky and tries to get him back in the ring. Under Rocky's tutoring, Tommy starts the road to success. Through Tommy's success, Rocky starts to feel like he is winning too. Because of that, Rocky turns less attention to his son Robert, who also goes through troubles coping with the change of the environment, and who is really in the need of fatherly advice. Soon comes Duke and lures Tommy away with money and promises to bigger glory. Tommy betrays Rocky and wins the belt. But living in Rocky's shadow gets to him. The final street brawl between Rocky and Tommy is a bit silly and farfetched (you also have to consider that Tommy came straight from the title fight), but on the other hand, it somehow felt an appropriately inglorious ending.Tommy Morrison gives an impressively good performance as a young guy with poor background hungry for success. At first, he is a likable guy who just wants to get a chance. Impatient but ready to work. And at first, it seems he is a fighter with heart. Relatable character, even when he betrays Rocky, he doesn't turn overly villainous and become unsympathetic. At least not at first. His single-minded aim for success and his impatience make Tommy an easy prey for greedy promoter Duke. Duke lures Tommy under his wing with the promises of money, fame, and title. After winning the title and thanking Duke instead of Rocky, Tommy loses most of his charm. It is easy to hate Tommy but it is also easy to understand why he did what he did. The media started to call him 'Rocky's Puppet' and living in the shadow of the great champion while you're trying to make it on your own, can get even the best ones. Like Adrian said about Tommy - he doesn't have your heart! And Adrian was right.Sylvester Stallone has said that he made this movie out of greed. No matter what he said, it is clear that a lot of thought and heart went into this movie. The story is touching and relatable. And Stallone's performance as Rocky Balboa was no simple phoning in. The screenplay wasn't perfect. There were some continuity errors - some minor, some were hard to overlook - Rocky's son being three or four years older at the beginning of this film compared to the ending of the previous movie. This one might be hardest to overlook because 'Rocky V' continues exactly where 'Rocky IV' ended. Nonetheless, the father-son relationship was neatly examined. Rocky at first supports his son, but when he starts training Tommy, Robert feels abandoned. Every time he sees his father having a great time with Tommy and not paying any attention to him, Robert feels more and more pushed aside. Sage Stallone gives a good performance as Robert or Rocky Jr.John G. Avildsen was back at the director's chair. I liked how this movie left out all the flash and glamour and visually looked more closely at the first one. Basically, this movie uses the same formula as all the previous 'Rocky' movies, but this time the story concentrates more on the stuff on the outside of the ring.'Rocky V' might not be as uplifting and motivational as the first movie (and the sequels between them), but it is still an inspiring movie with heart. It shows the different types of fights the fighters (and everyone else too) must go through. It is a far better movie than people like to give it a credit. I don't care, how Stallone thinks about it, I love this movie.",Rocky V
211,nuacos,Much better than I expected.,7,21 July 2002,"While this movie may not rank among the all-time greats, it is, in my estimation, a pretty fair, decently made movie (I found it much more believable and down to earth than Rocky IV).

From his ascension to the top, to his bankruptcy, Rocky remains a loving, simple and kind-hearted person.No matter how much life throws at him, he still fights with integrity. He loves his family and wants the very best for them.I find this episode of the series to be true to the character. He is a good man and a real champion, with our without the money.The song at the end by Elton John summarizes the character.I love this movie and I highly recommend it to anyone, fan of the series or not.",Rocky V
213,jannayu-subaju,Rocky isn't down yet,8,28 March 2017,"Whilst I hold Rocky I and Rocky II as the best in the saga Rocky V for me easily sweeps third spot. People expected something different to what this movie actually produced and I get the feeling some people would have rather had a cheesy boxing film like Rocky III and Rocky IV and have Rocky take on an ultimately unbelievable opponent. Well sorry, not here. I like this heart filled and story oriented film, unlike Rocky III and Rocky IV this film isn't primarily about boxing, it's about Rocky trying to pass on his legacy to a young boxer who eventually stabs him in the back.In training this young boxer Rocky neglects his family and starts to forget what means the most to him. Perhaps he feels that Tommy Gunn is the only way to bring the money and the flash lifestyle back to him and his family, but by the end of the film you will know that the only thing which ever mattered to Rocky was his family and his own self respect. This trumps Rocky III and Rocky IV in the fact that it had an emotional impact, which both of those films lacked. Mickey's and Apollo's deaths were played out within two or three scenes before Rocky is back with the cheesy music preparing to take on an unbelievable opponent in those films, you practically forget that those characters died. Where as in Rocky V after losing his money and then being convinced by Adrian not to fight (remember this line ""I don't care about the money, it's you"" or something similar?) that scene right there had an emotional impact. That impact played out for several scenes including the epic flashback scene in the old gym with Mick, which was probably the second most emotional scene in the entire saga after Rocky reading to Adrian whilst she is in a coma. With Rocky low on his chips, he trains an upcoming fighter who quickly replicates Rocky's style and hunger in the ring however eventually shows that he doesn't have Rocky's heart when he leaves Rocky for a selfish promoter weho promises Tommy fame. The film deals with what was a big issue in boxing and that is corruption.With a damaged brain and haunted by visions of his previous fights Rocky is in no shape to fight but the ruthless Tommy Gunn persists and eventually knocks down Rocky's closest friend Paulie, to which Rocky can take no more, demanding Gunn meets him outside for the biggest and most emotional fight in the saga.Easily laying Gunn down in the first round Rocky claims his anguish at what Gunn had done to him stating that he and Gunn were suppose to be like ""Brothers"", hurt; Rocky makes his way back but Gunn isn't finished he sneaks up behind Rocky and attacks him cheaply in the street. Rocky dazed and confused takes Gunn's best punches, each one triggering flash backs to the powerful Russian beating Rocky. Eventually Rocky is put to the floor and Gunn cockily strides off with his promoter.BUT Rocky isn't down yet, his last inspiration comes in the form of a vision of Mickey who proclaims ""He's no machine, I didn't hear no bell! GET UP YOU SON OF A B|TCH! COS MICKEY LOVES YA"", no Rocky fan can deny that this line sends a tingling down their spine and a sparkle in their eye as Rocky rises and shouts to Gunn ""Hey Tommy! I didn't hear no bell! One more round"", Gunn obliges whilst his promoter who doesn't believe Gunn has what it takes to beat Rocky in a street fight shouts ""You lose you're finished!"". So this is it Rocky and Gunn exchange blows before Adrian and Robert arrive at street side to offer their support, when it looks like Rocky is losing their cries of support spur him on. Add to this the awesome music and you really have an epic battle.",Rocky V

216,UCFMan29,"The ""Underdog"" of the Series",6,31 March 2004,"Often deemed the weakest film of the series, ""Rocky V"" is an underrated look at the ""dirty"" side of boxing, fatherhood, and the triumph of the human spirit. Okay, so it's not filled with Oscar-caliber performances, but it's well casted and very gritty.Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) returns home from his latest victory, a 15-round slugfest with Soviet boxer Ivan Drago, only to find out that he's been victimized by a crooked accountant and has lost his entire fortune. On top of that he learns that he has suffered irreversable brain damage which will force his retirement from the ring. Rocky is then forced back to his roots when he moves his family back to inner-city Philadelphia. There, he re-opens what was once Mickey's gym and begins to train young boxers. Along the way he crosses paths with Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) an aspiring young boxer craving Rocky's guidance. Rocky, reluctant at first, finally decides to become Tommy's manager figuring that this could be his last shot at regaining respect for himself and his family. While all this is going on, Rocky's son Robert (Sage Stallone) is being bullied in school. Robert then begins to feel neglected by Rocky because of all the attention he's giving to Tommy and his boxing career. Soon thereafter, Tommy is enticed by a ruthless promoter (Richard Gant) who promises him a shot at the title. In the midst of this, Rocky struggles to regain the love and respect of his son while Tommy turns against his mentor and challenges him to a fight. The climactic streetfight is one of the more intense fights seen on film, not to mention Bill Conti's wonderful score. Sure, this is not the most inspiring film of the series, but it's one of the realist. It's tough, warm, and nostalgic all rolled into one. Notice the music and feel of the film and you'll think back to the earlier Rocky films (I and II).",Rocky V

We see Rocky struggle through the pitfalls of fatherhood and through the challenge of managing another fighter in the corrupt world of professional boxing.Sure, Stallone's performance may be slightly exaggerated, but he's playing a punch-drunk boxer, and that's exactly what he comes across as being.",Rocky V
218,maverick50,"""Touch me and I'll sue""",6,14 July 2004,"OK so it is the worst out of the series. OK some of the actors aren't what you would call Oscar winning candidates - Tommy Gunn (a real boxer not an actor) and Rocky Jr. (just a kid, not really an actor) i'm looking at you mainly... OK the final fight isn't in the squared circle...BUT, this isn't that bad a film, i actually really enjoy it. I often think it would be nice to see what happens to the hero of films after the credits role, Rocky V is just a chance to see Rocky in later life. Stallone has clearly tried to go back to the roots of the original and in many ways it works, but what this film really lacks is anything to really get the viewer on the edge of their seat. In Rocky the whole film has you biting your nails waiting to see what happens, it also contains the two finest pieces of film EVER - 1. When Micky goes to leave Rocky's place and he realises he's forgotten his hat, this is so subtle and so touching i've never seen anything like it before or since. 2. In round 14 of the fight when Rock gets back up and Creed just can't believe it. Rocky 2 has the best training sequence with the whole WIN ROCKY WIN segment, as well as the fight itself. Rocky 3 similarly has great training and some really great moments with Creed and Rocky as well as a touching farewell to Mick. 4 is just pure mindless entertainment, not as clever or as subtle as its predecessors but great training sequences again and a good message.But Rocky V, the final film(?!) just lacks anything that really puts it apart from the others, it tries but just doesn't quite make it on the same level.

220,marsmitchell79-120-37821,"Not Bad and Entertaining, But I Thought It Should Have Went in Another Direction.",6,11 February 2018,"Rocky couldn't get licensed in America, so this means being hit by a good punch(OR A FEW GOOD PUNCHES) by a fighter in boxing gloves(HANDS COVERED IN EXTRA PADDING AND BY FAR SOFTER THAN FISTS) could make him an invalid or dead. So, near the end, Rocky takes several almost bare knuckle punches from heavyweight champion and heavy-hitting protege Tommy Gunn(Morrison).So, maybe a realistic direction for the movie to take was for Rocky to come out and win like he did at first. After that, Tommy fights dirty like he did in the movie and hits him with a couple of punches, but puts Rocky away. Rocky keeps his sanity. Life's great for Tommy Gunn over a wonderful career. Rocky trains his son gradually over time--after Adrian's invitation to be there for his family. His son eventually goes through the rankings motivated to avenge Tommy's dirty beating of his dad. Just as Tommy's set to retire, his undefeated son challenges Tommy just as Tommy did his dad years earlier. His son makes the Balboa name golden once again by outboxing Tommy as his dad once did Clubber Lang, but KO'ing him in the late rounds. This also ties all of the Rocky movies together: there's a boxer, a croucher, and power. At the end, Rocky and Adrian get their wealth back through their son instead of through Tommy! Most everybody has seen this movie; it's almost 30 years old! These are just some changes that I feel were warranted. Sylvester's ego was just too high in this movie; he always had to be the hero.",Rocky V

Add to this the awesome music and you really have an epic battle.Eventually Rocky starts to feel Gunn getting tired and unloads everything he has on him and knocks him into a police van which then leads to Gunn being arrested. Rocky's family run to comfort him. Rocky's feeling of betrayal and woe is quickly removed with the chants from around the street and the blessing of his friend the Father of the local church. Rocky walks away smiling, the journey is complete, he started out with nothing, he proved his self worth, he's found what matters to him, his family and his pride. The ending sets up nicely for the ""they lived happily ever after"" type finale.Rocky isn't about boxing, it's about a man proving his self worth in the world. Rocky III and Rocky IV detracted from this premise, but Rocky V returns to it. With the emotionless and storyless boxing films which are Rocky III and Rocky IV, Rocky V easily ranks above them for me.It's sad to see Stallone criticise this film so much. I thought he'd be one of a few who realise what makes this film so good but he seems to back down to the media and the critics of this film by branding it as garbage. Maybe these critics would have been more satisfied with Rocky v Ivan Drago II or Rocky v Clubber Lang and Thunderlips for Rocky V. For me, and some other fans, Rocky V came full circle, the emotion is there, the story is there and Rocky pretty much nails his character again. After Rocky III and Rocky IV I thought it lost because in those he doesn't act like the good willed, street wise guy who comes out with these bashful sayings like ""I see like a beetle or something"" instead he talks like John Rambo and is perfectly polished. He tries such bashful lines in Rocky Balboa but they totally fail:Rocky: ""Jamaica?....European.""That's pityful, and cringeworthy.",Rocky V
224,milesgeorge,"Back to his roots, and back on form.",8,1 June 2007,"In this fifth installment of the Rocky franchise our hero is out of luck. Brain damaged from the epic encounter with Drago in Rocky Four, he is unable to fight and in danger of going bankrupt, he moves back to his old neighborhood and begins training up and coming fighter tommy ""the machine"" gunn. For those of you who have heard the general conscientious that Rocky V is not worth watching I strongly advise you to give it a go, the criticism of this film is something that has never really made sense to me. It moves away from the traditional format, (which by the fourth installment had become a series of consecutive montages with badly dated music) and sees Rocky go truly back to his roots even wearing the hat again, add that to a return for Burgess Meredith in some bitter sweet flashback scenes along with a simple but decent storyline and you get a vastly underrated film. Rocky is persuaded by a young contender Tommy Gunn to step back into the world of boxing as a manager and coach. The pair of them get carried away with Tommy's success, Rocky begins to neglect his son and Gunn becomes lured by the riches promised to him by Richard Gant's George Washington Duke, an obvious ringer for Don King. Rocky V takes the franchise full circle and makes note of the obvious changes that have taken place in the world of boxing, and come to think of it, most sports around the globe. It brings a clash of the two types of sportsmen, the old fashioned and the new. The difference in Rocky 5 being that the new uses his skills seeking fame and fortune and forgets what truly matters, a mistake Rocky himself makes in the third film. The main difference however is that Tommy lacks one special ingredient that Balboa has, something that made Rocky endearing to us all in the first place, Rocky has got heart and so has this film. It's also worth pointing out that it hasn't dated nearly as badly as the third and fourth installments and aside from some dodgy late eighties-early nineties rap music it doesn't have much else that ages it. At the premier of the recent Rocky Balboa film I saw an interview with Sylvester Stallone he referred to Rocky V as a ""bad film"" and he also noted that when he bought the anthology he ""threw the fifth one out."" Now i'm not going to kid myself and think that the great man is going to ever read this review but ill take the tiny chance that he might one day glance at it to say:- Sly, give this one another go its not bad, not bad at all. Rocky V is certainly not deserving of being chucked out of the anthology, in fact it deserves its place in there, it deserves to share a box with the rest, more so that Rocky Four anyway. While this film may not have the emotional punch of Rocky Balboa it certainly isn't worth disregarding.

229,Paris4242,"Not the Worst of the ""Rocky Films""",8,25 January 2007,"""Rocky V"" premiered in 1990 to awful reviews. I have watched this film at least a dozen times and still cannot understand why some people hate this film. Granted, it's not in the caliber of ""Rocky"" or even ""Rocky II"", but it's definitely just as good as ""Rocky III"". First, the return of Mickey Goldmill in flashback sequences makes this film worth watching. The chemistry between Sylvester Stallone and Burgess Meredith is outstanding and was greatly missed in ""Rocky IV"". The ""Get up, you son a bitch! 'Cause Mickey loves you"" speech is simply touching. It's rare when a older man tells a younger man how important he is to him as he is to the younger man. Most child actors are annoying to watch, but Sage Stallone does an admirable job as Rocky's son Robert. One of my favorite scenes in the film is when Rocky tries to give a crash course lesson on being ""street smart"" to his son and reminds him that they have to stick together because they are the ""home team"". Simple dialog like this adds to the reality of the situation. Father Carmine from ""Rocky II"" makes a memorable return and it was nice to see Mikey from ""Rocky"" return to Mick's gym like Spider Rico did in ""Rocky Balboa"". Here's some information that hasn't been written much. The original actress who played Little Marie from ""Rocky"" makes a sad cameo that was later edited out of ""Rocky V"". She became the ""whore"" that Rocky warned her she would become in the original ""Rocky"" film if she didn't start hanging out with better people. Talia Shire and Burt Young continued to perform well in their roles as Adrian and Paulie. John Avildsen returns to direct what was originally the last of the Rocky movies. My only problem with ""Rocky V"" is the silly street fight ending. I think audiences would of rather see the formula of Rocky training and beating Tommy Gunn in the ring. Also the character of George Washington Duke was too over the top for my taste. By the way, the main bully who takes Rocky's son coat is now playing Eric on the HBO series ""Entourage"".",Rocky V
230,jj0908,Most realistic Rocky since part 2,10,25 December 2016,"You know why people don't like this movie? It's because it's gritty and depressing, it's real life! You take that many devastating blows to the head, you're gonna get brain damage. People were expecting another superhuman matchup when this movie came out, nope, just the consequence of his boxing career. Remember what the Russian did to Apollo? How on earth is Rocky supposed to come out unscathed?? Stallone was going for realism; irreversible brain damage. He got dumber than he was in part 1. But he still had heart, and that's what I loved about this movie. Part 6 of the Rocky series ignores this movie because of fan hate, that's sad. This was a great movie.",Rocky V
231,onehotmotherf,Highly under rated,9,25 December 2006,"I felt the need to write something about this movie seeing the constant bashing it is taking, i'm a huge Stallone fan and an even bigger Rocky fan, People are rating this movie really bad, and i'm thinking are they getting the point? For me 3+4 were the most shallow movies if the series, don't get me wrong they are awesome films but they portray a more action oriented film, where as the first 2 were a good mix of drama and action, getting back to this movie, i feel this takes us back to roots of Rocky nice and dramatic with not so much commercialness in it as the previous 2, i love to see the old neighbourhood from the first 2 movies and how he fits back in with it, this film is about his struggle to deal with bankruptcy family issues and who he is. I think Stallone did a stellar job with this movie, the ending is superb and the soundtrack is nice and upbeat with the old classics in there too, Elton Johns ""Measure of a Man"" at the end for me really sums up Rocky's life and i love the captures playing through the end titles with it, as for the fight scene, classic in my eyes, through all the Rocky movies we here him coming from a street fighters background but we never see it until now.....the way he stares at Tommy and tells him to step outside really shows the animalistic streetfighter side of Rocky up until now we only heard about. I'm sorry if people don't agree with me but i think this film deserves much more praise than it receives, Hail Stallone Hail Rocky!",Rocky V
232,Jeremywa,Rocky V (Go For It),10,17 April 2007,"This movie is about Rocky's life after boxing, and his fight with Ivan Drago. Rocky loses everything from his bank account, to his boxing career, but what makes this movie so special is the fact that he didn't lose his heart. Rocky as I'm sure any would begins to struggle with his new life, and has a hard time accepting his life as it now is. So Rocky begins to train boxers at Mighty Mick's Gynasium for a way to pastime and deal with his own personal pain. A young fighter Tommy Gunn begins to beg Rocky to take him under his wing, and manage him. Rocky to start off with is very reluctant to this idea, but with his heart and charisma he decides to but Tommy after gaining the fame and popularity that comes with sports signs with a unpopular very rude promoter George Washington Duke who was pro-positing Rocky to fight Union Cane the new heavyweight champ who won the belt after Rocky left it vacant to fight Ivan Drago to revenge Apollo Creed's death. This taunts Rocky because his wife Adrian won't let him fight due to brain damage, and wanting to keep him safe. After Rocky begins to train, and grow a relationship with Tommy his relationship with his family (Adrian, Paulie, Rocky Jr), begins to diminish as Rocky puts all his focus on Tommy. When Tommy turns on Rocky, Rocky knows he must fight once more to stop the taunting, so he can gain not the title back, but his family and self respect in a street fight showdown. Tommy won the belt in what I believe was a fixed fight by Duke because Union Cane showed no want, or desire to fight in a title defense. Sports writers taunt Tommy to fight a real fighter, and that Cane is just a paper champion which really angers him. I love this movie because it really brought by the character everyone came to love in the first two. Three and four just revolve around fighting, and not the character. I love how Rocky comes to realize what is important, and establishes a close bond with his son Rocky Jr(Sage Stallone). I love how Adrian shows her true love for Rocky by protecting him, all Duke wanted to do was make money off Rocky's popularity, mock him, and get him the reputation of a sellout just like he did with Tommy to get to Rocky if not for her this would of happened. The soundtrack was definitely no where near the heart felt original themes of Bill Conit. It does include to good songs though in Joey B. Ellis theme of the movie Go For It, and Elton John's Measure of a man which are both wonderful entertaining songs. They should have played Conti's Going the Distance, or Conquest during the street fight to better capture the heart of a Rocky fight. This movie in my mind goes the distance with heart, family, and passion. Rocky Balboa is a much better movie, but I'm glad they were both made as Rocky Balboa finishes the series on a high note, and restores the original magic of the first, something this entertaining thriller (ROCKY V) failed to do.",Rocky V
233,gabigirl80,I never understood why so many people hated this movie,10,4 March 2002,"The Rocky movies have all been good. Some however have been better than others. Rocky IV will always be the best in my opinion, mainly because of the excellent casting job. Another excelent quality was the performance by Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago.So going into this movie I had my worries, I couldn't grasp how they possibly could have complimented the series by making one where rocky isn't the ""Great White Hope"". I was wrong.I think Stallone did an excellent job on the writing. This was a true rocky move, where as all the other films in the series were fun and exciting, this one went back to the basics of the original Rocky and stole back some of it's charm. Rocky is supposed to be about having the heart of a champion and the faith in ones self to pull through, this carries that same, seemingly forgotten, message.I did think some of the story was a bit over the top. I also felt the ""back to basics"" attitude, with Rocky being nothing of what he once had been, was rediculous at time. But I feel that overall the story was well written and well told.I exspecially apreciated the casting of Sage Stallone playing Rocky Jr. Who could have been better to play this role than Rocky's own son.I liked the fact that they kept all of the original actors, in some way or another, and that they allowed him to have a final moment of victory at the end.
I must mention though that I hope this will be Stallones final effort in the Rocky franchise. He is getting a bit old for the role and I think they should leave it alone with him retiring on top.",Rocky V

Its the underdog who makes you cry when he wins, and loses, or when he says ""adrian, I did It!!!"" or something like that. This movie has the theme go for it well it brings it, i would have a vote would you rather see rocky all pampered, and rich or would you rather see him go back to his roots. Well my vote is 2 his roots, thats what made the 1st movie great, and thats what makes this one great. Also, tommy was an excellent villain, and duke, OOO all i have to say is the **** deserved to be punched, Best line in the movie was between duke and Rocky: touch me and i sue ya...(punch in the face) sue me for wat.

235,lifeanddeath_grim-975-34168,I really can only say is wow,4,12 February 2011,"What a tragedy of a ending to a movie. I understand maybe going back to the ring and fighting Tommy Gun is unrealistic for a man who was told he has brain damage, but really was it needed to have a brawl out in the streets to end the series until 2006. I started to watch this series for the first time in my life, Rocky 1 and Rocky 2 were of course the best of the series. It was a story that made you believe in the character and when he fought you were there with the crowd cheering. When Rocky 3 and 4 came along that's when the 80's showed what people wanted. A story about the impossible. We had the Clubber and Drago fighting Rocky, they made them seem impossible to defeat, but in the ring of Rocky no man ever compared to his strength. Those were guilty pleasures to watch, but honestly it was tiring to watch the same thing. Rocky goes through trauma, then Rocky snaps out of it and trains to 80s music and then in the end we have Rocky knocking out the impossible. When Rocky 5 walked into the room, I was tired and I was expecting less of the film. I was genially surprised on how good the movie started showing how a man was wrecked inside and has lost everything that he hold dearly and what he loved the most. It could have had been a classic, but it folded under pressure. The ending were he fought Tommy Gun was not needed. I was hoping for a man to just walk away, and not end up damaging himself more. It wasn't a way to end the series, the series started with a man with a dream to be the best. Honestly just watch the first 4 you will enjoy them greatly, and then skip the 5th and watch Rocky Balboa.",Rocky V
236,Saeta77,I liked it,9,9 October 2003,"I have read some harsh comments on this flick, and I, being a great fan of the Rocky series, would like to say something good about it. I really liked the story, because Rocky has to go back with his wife and son to the old neighborhood, where the kid has to adjust, and so must his parents. It's about family, how it must be united, because you can't trust many people out there. The song The Measure of a Man, by Elton John, and the flashbacks of all the prior parts, are just great. Besides, that scene of Rocky going back to the old gym and remembering what Mick had told him about not giving up is just one of the best scenes in all the Rocky saga.",Rocky V
237,tiffanyox34,yea,10,1 February 2005,"alright, this movie is without a doubt a good movie. maybe not as grade a as the others but a good movie. it actually involves his family and heart and not JUST boxing. It shows that hes a human and not just some fighting machine, he can live like a normal person unlike a superstar as he always has. I actually like this movie the best except for rocky 4 .. that movie was the best one out of the rocky series, but anyone who says that this movie is bad then they're definitely lying because this movies is one of the best Sylvester Stallone movie hes ever made. so keep the bad comments to yourself because they're not wanted here. and in conclusion THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!!!!",Rocky V
238,gnrugacf24,disappointing but still a rocky flick,4,1 August 2005,"I am sick of everyone saying that rocky V sucked as well. the movie itself wasn't such a bad movie. it was ,however, extremely disappointing because after all those years of grueling training montages and hard work, Rocko loses all of his money because of Paulie's ridiculous gambling habits. its just sad to see the rock go out broke, he didn't deserve to leave cinema as a bum who let his family and friends take advantage of him. it was great tho because when he gets back from Russia later that ,probably year, his son is 5 years older. the poor kid gets picked on for being rich ,so, naturally Paulie teaches him how to fight? despite all the holes and questions seeing Rocko in street-fighter mode is just great, and seeing him kick the crap out of a well trained 25 year old is awesome.",Rocky V

Every 2 seconds I was saying, ""What the crap?!"" because i just couldn't believe that all those bad things could happen to Rocky so fast. I mean he just got back from Russia and he finds out that his idiot friend, Paulie, signed some paper, which made the Balboa family bankrupt! they lost their estate and all their money, and ended up living back in the area they were living in for Rocky I. I also could not believe how Rocky's son from Rocky IV looked about 8 years old when Rocky left to fight Drago, and then when he gets back, his son in Rocky V, (who is Sylvester Stallone's real-life son) looked about 13 & dorky! It seems that all Sylvester tried to do in the last 2 Rocky movies is somehow get his family involved in the movie, which is not right. Though Rocky's son in Rocky V does look more Italian, it was just not the same. I will never watch this movie again because the plot made me so angry. If they do make a Rocky VI, which i highly doubt since Sylvester Stallone is 60 now i think, i will watch it just to see how it is.",Rocky V
240,shanegerald,A Must See For Any Rocky Fan,7,10 February 2006,"By all means, I don't believe this is an Oscar movie, or even the best in the Rocky series. However if you are a true Rocky fan, you will really enjoy this movie. It shows a great side of Rocky that is more outside the ring, and we get to go back to the streets where the original Rocky started. The Flash backs of Mick in the Gym with young Rocky just might bring a tear to your eye. And then of course there is still Paulie who delivers one of his best lines in the entire series. ""Hey Rock, what do you say we go wrap our teeth around a few cold ones."" The final fight seen is a little drawn out, but this is Rocky who can get knocked down 20 times in a fight and still win. Plus the final fight is a good old fashioned street fight, which I thought was great. Any true Rocky fan will love this movie.",Rocky V
241,FrostyKoala,"Sly, Dali, Olsens Oh My!",1,26 May 2005,"I figured it out! There is only one way this movie could have possibly made. Here's the scenario, Sly Stallone is sitting on Pee-Wee's gigantic talking chair snorting coke off of a Salvador Dali painting. He starts thinking to himself: ""That arm wrestling drama I did back in 1987 was pretty bad. But I think I could top that."" That's when Lawrence Fishburn busts down the door and said ""Dude it was pretty bad, but there is no way in hell any movie you make can be worse then that pile of crap called ""Manos: Hands of Fate"" The bar was set, and in just a few days Stallone had a group of Community College actors together to work on the next installment in the Rocky series. The result of this all is on par with a Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen flick, minus the girls. Instead, just add a couple beefed up guys in really short shorts and a really awful Don King impersonator. This, like the Olsen flicks has a few minutes of crappy dialogue followed up by a music and flashes of sweaty men swinging at each other.I also know why this movie has managed to squeeze out a four on the ratings. It is the result of a quantity of disillusioned 40 year old Rocky fans who are sitting in their mother's basement with his high school letter jacket on his shoulders and a Keystone Light in his hands. Without these sad folks, Future War would be pushed aside and would be clasped to a ball and chain in order to roll out the red carpet for the single worst sequel of all time, Rocky V.",Rocky V
242,vpiccarillo,SPOILER ALERT: What did you expect after Drago killed Apollo in 2 Rounds for Rocky in this film?,10,9 November 2020,"Let's Recap Very Quick on why Rocky V is not nearly as bad as people explain.Obviously, Drago was going to do some damage to Rocky after killing Apollo Creed in a 2 Round exhibition.Imagine if in this movie, Rocky had no brain damage?
That would make Drago look like nothing and Rocky 4 like nothing!This had to be put in place and also this timeline sets up for (in my opinion the best Rocky film - Rocky Balboa 2006) Rocky balboa (2006), Creed (2015) , and Creed II (2018).Rocky is brought back to his humble roots after some accounting fraud; Paulie signed not knowing he was signing power of attourney giving Rockys accountant full power of Rockys assets (money) and tried to do some housing flips to make more cash and put Rockys money back. Basically Rocky would never of known what happened.This movie has one of the best scores by Bill Conti. John Aldversion (I probably butchered his last name) the same director from Rocky (1976).The drama in this film is very high compared to its previous films where the action was very high in III and IV.People say the ending should of ended in the ring instead of a street fight. However this still would of not been a good look for the movie. Even if Rocky had no brain damage and fought Tommy Gunn in the ring in the end; it would of made IV look like it was nothing.The street fight 1000% could of been better.We all know fighting doesn't solve anything - Tommy Gunn is still the champ in the end, and Rocky has no money leaving the end fight with no result.The only thing that should have been different was how Sage Stallone (Rockys son) fought the bullies in school and made up after; The same thing should of applied with the adults in this film. Rocky and Tommy should have hugged it out at the end rather Tommy just getting arrested.All in all I give this movie 10 out of 10 stars because the drama is very high and the music by Bill Conti was amazing. Yes some of the other music did not fit and there could of been different ways to have different scenes. - This movie had the best introduction to any Rocky film and in mu opinion the best last scene with credits with Sage Stallone- Sylvester Stallones real life son.",Rocky V

I thought this movie was one of the best movies because it didn't follow every one else's view of what a movie should be.

Stallone it's in a very good form, and the rest of the cast it's right, we can see good action scenes, a history about the family, and how to survive in the street's.It's probably the best performance of Stallone,because he is not a wonderful actor, but he is particularly good in the rocky saga, always we can see Talhia Shire, crying for the fighter, the teenage son of Balboa, learning about the life, the drunk uncle Polie, and there's and interesting apparition of Burgess Meredith, in the role of Micky, the charismatic trainer. In this movie Rocky it's in troubles, but he have the enough courage, to win this round, one more in this large story. He will find a new opportunity , to regret to the top of the glory, but this is not simple. He must run in the street's, again. In this movie, the American people always love him, its a national hero, and it's not easy for a hero try to retire, and go home. The people want to see him fighting and fighting, for ever, but he is human, now his son needs his attention. He have problems with the money, he is not rich, like in the old times of glory.

249,triester64,Unimpressed,2,28 June 2006,"I would have to say that as far as the standard that was set for this movie by its predecessors, it was pretty bad. If the moral of the story was that you don't need riches to be happy in life, then fine. But I don't really like how they portray this man who has ""fought war's in the ring"" at the end of his career, with nothing to show for it. The worst part about it is that of all the people Rocky became friends with, and all the fans he made over the years, he had no one to help him back to the top. I mean, were was Apollo's family during all of this? Considering the fact that Rocky went all the way to the Soviet Union to defeat Goliath (Drago) because he killed her husband, I would have thought Apollo's wife would have helped him out a little in his financial situation. Personally I don't think that this movie was necessary, and that the writers were basically trying to milk the Rocky story as much as they could. Hopefully this new movie is better, but seeing as how the Rocky in the movie is around 50 years old, and Stallone in real life is right around 60, I doubt it will be that great.",Rocky V

It is not up to par with the rest of the series, but it still has its moments.The movie is a good reminder what life can be for athletes after they retire - it isn't just bright lights and charity events. Rocky having to retire after his match with Ivan Drago is a very emotional turn of events. Tommy Gunn isn't the best character of the series and the storyline isn't too believable, but I still enjoy watching the movie from time to time.I really enjoyed seeing Rocky's fall from grace and I think this movie holds its place in the Rocky-series.",Rocky V
251,Jay-Moviefanatic,Unbelievably underrated,8,29 January 2007,It never seizes to amaze me that everyone enjoyed the first instalment of rocky so much but not this.I mean come on lets face it after one and two rocky just became a film about showing of fighting in the ring when before it had much more meaning to it and a strong story of love and feelings behind it.I think rocky V took the films back to its roots as it is not all based on action...yes You see many fights with tommy gunn in the ring but the strong story of son and father behind it was touching and the acting was extremely good and the direction was great.Also the whole scene in the gym where he remembers Mick touched me inside because i felt like i was watching a true rocky film again.Personally i think people got bored because after 3 and 4 they became so stuck on the rocky action flick rather then the true rocky film an that disappoint me as this could have easily been a classic to.Anyone who agrees will love this underrated classic but anyone who is just there for the action you may as well stay away.,Rocky V
252,russell-howe,"Sure it ain't great, but give it a chance it's okay.",7,22 November 2007,"I laughed out loud at the acting of Tommy Morrison and also at Adrian's now token motivational speech, also the terrible earring his rebel son wears haha. Also, anybody else notice how the son spoke all proper when he was a dork but then developed a Rocky-style Italian gangster accent as he rebelled? Then back to normal at the end again! Anyway, perfect it ain't that's for damn sure. But for some reason this seems to have been labelled the worst sequel ever made and that's really unfair. The first 20 minutes are really great, they bring Rocky right back down to earth after the MTV video that was Rocky IV(although I did love that film, and it's probably still the ultimate 'man film' to this day). It gets a bit cheesy after this and it's just not as fun to watch Rocky train someone as it is to watch Rocky fight, I guess. But there are a lot of good moments in this movie and it tugs on your heart strings a lot more than the action movies that were 3 and 4.Give it a chance and it may surprise you, but it won't be your favourite.",Rocky V
253,ryanaustin-1,"Rocky V, terribly under-rated",10,7 December 2006,"I have rated this movie as a 10 which will make most readers think I don't have a clue what I'm talking about. To be honest, I don't believe this movie is a 10, but I feel I need to give it that bit extra due to the very low rating this movie has polled on this site. Even though it will make next to no difference to the overall rating of the movie, it will at least make me feel a little better. I have watched the rocky series probably 100 times each and if I had anything to do with making them, I would feel offended that Rocky V is rated lower than Rockys III and IV. I feel that, going on best to worst, the order should be The original on top, followed by the second, then the fifth, then the third, with number 4 coming in last. The original Rocky is one of the best movies ever made, no question. By the second film, Stallone took over directing duties and done a decent job with it, apart from one or two corny things thrown in to it. By the third one however, all common sense in the series went out the window right from the opening montage. The fourth Rocky should have been titled Rocky 80's. If anyone over the age of 12 truly loves that movie, you should be ashamed of yourself. The first movie wasn't a sports movie, it was a drama which happened to be about a journeyman boxer getting to live his dream by fighting for a heavyweight championship. Rocky IV is just a big stupid fight scene, with the rest of the movie just filling in time. Why would Rocky turn down his prize money for this fight? Yes, he was doing it to avenge his friends death, but why not avenge Apollo, and make 10 million at the same time which he could at least give to a charity? The training sequence is stupid, why would there be any gyms at all if running up a mountain was better than all the best equipment available, mixed with steroids. The fight scene itself, which was really all they had, was obscenely ridiculous. There isn't a referee in the world that wouldn't have stopped the contest 3 rounds in. Rocky gets dropped a good 10 times that fight but keeps getting up, yet when he drops Drago once, the show is over. He somehow gets an entire nation to change from spitting on him at the start, to loving him, all in under 30 minutes, and all by punching there national hero in the head. And don't get me started on the speech he gives in the middle of the ring at the end, I'm cringing just thinking about it. The reason Rocky 5 is not so popular, is that people were looking for a sequel to Rocky 4, not another sequel to Rocky 1. Number 5 breaks away from the 80's crap brought to us by the previous 2 sequels. It goes back to its roots of a real story, and they brought the original director back for it. This again has made a drama set in the world of boxing, rather than just a 'boxing movie'. And for people who are just after the action, it actually has more boxing scenes than the other movies, its just Tommy Gunn for most of it instead of the title character, who by the way, was played by Tommy Morrison, who went on to win the World Heavyweight title in real life. The script is solid, the characters have depth and it underlines the corruption that is ruining the sport of boxing. If you really are a fan of either film or boxing, rent the movie again and tell me i'm wrong",Rocky V

Did Rock give away all his clothes....? is it reasonable that he would go back to wearing the same sweaty grey sweatshirt and loan shark outfit. His son was so bad that it is hard to describe. After viewing Rocky Balboa (rocky VI), I had to go back and revisit Rocky V just to confirm how bad it was and it was worse than I remembered.The new movie is very good and a fitting end for this series.Rocky I = 10 Rocky II = 7 Rocky III = 5 Rocky IV = 1 (aka Stallone defeats the USSR) Rocky V = 0 Rocky VI = 8Thank God he did not leave us with Rocky V as the ending",Rocky V
255,xlancy,Going the distance bein'broke.,9,4 August 2007,"Though commercially unsuccessful ""Rocky-V"" I believe hits the bullseye with far more force than any other Rocky leafs. If you take out the first and the final(ROCKY BALBOA) episode of Rocky's epic journey this movie stands by far the most compelling. The reason? In this No. 5 Rocky doesn't have to prove anything and still he proved that he's all about soul and keeping it intact when it comes to life. He had nothing on line... some might say his 'reppo' but if you take in consideration what were online previously (his rematch(ROCKY II), first tittle defeat to Mr. T(ROCKY III), loss of his new best friend 'Apollo'(ROCKY IV)) ...in this first of the final Rocky series Balboa makes you believe life still exists after the end.Stallone plays the character of a modern day real life super hero with such easiness and talent that tears you up emotionally. Losing up all the money and being back on the roads isn't easy but Stallone makes you believe Rocky isn't about ups and down ..... he's about Heart and Family. The final street fight scene tells it all.I still remember the involvement of some window shoppers at a Circuit City store back in 2005 where it was being played on then new wide screen HDTV's. At least 30 some people were stood numb watching Stallone take on Tommy and all cheering as if it was a real-reel-re-shoot. Just unbelievable. ROCKY V deserves a moment of truth ... RESPECT, which it lacks from us.",Rocky V
256,jessecon3,This was my fav. of the Rocky collection,10,9 July 2002,"This was a great movie.. and just because Sly doesnt box doesnt mean it isnt good. I think it's a good way to end the Rocky series, but I wouldn't be mad if there was a 6th movie. That would be pretty cool, admit it. To see his son all grown up and everything. Well thats my opinion, and for you who read this, voice your own opinion, it never hurts, later- -Jesse",Rocky V
257,matthewilli81,worst Rocky of the lot by far!!,5,22 April 2002,"An awful ending to a highly entertaining Anthology. The whole idea behind taking this rags-riches character who fought against all the odds, was a million to 1 shot, etc, and turn him back to the bum he was first time around goes against all the films previously stood for.Returning from Russia, Rocky suffering from brain damage does not recognize his son has aged by about 5 years since he left (how long was he away for??) Enter G.W.Duke, an unscrupulous promoter, so based on a real life promoter that all he needs is the trademark haircut. He's only stating to work his magic when Rocky retires, again!!! i think he retired in every film didn't he? Rocky looses all his money because of a bent accountant, and has to sell his house, cars, motorbike (minus a crash helmet) to get by.Back to Philly, where Paulie has his old place, Adrian has her old job, and Rocky has his old clothes, even his hat!! wheres the bouncy ball though? This is where he meets Tommy Gunn. who he takes under his wing and leads up the rankings whilst neglecting his kid. All's sweet until the evil promoter mentioned before gets his claws in and breaks up the Balboa/Gunn combo by promising the youngster a title shot, and a girlfriend with a hell of a cleavage.Gunn takes the title but is looked on as a paper champ, ""He ain't no Rocky"", so he calls out Balboa to a street fight where they batter each other so OTT, that it makes the other Rocky fights look realistic. Balboa wins the fight Hooraaaaaaaay!! His sons love Hooraaaaaaay!! And then gives the promoter a good hiding. Only in America!! The scene in Mighty Micks featuring a cameo by the wonderful Burgees Meredith is the best thing to come out of the movie. It's an awesome performance by an actor the series missed after the 3rd film.Pease Mr Stallone leave Rocky 6 on your writing desk.G.W Duke: ""With Health being fine what more can a man ask for?"" Paulie: ""Money and hair!""",Rocky V
258,donkeymccool,Rocky V...decent,6,31 March 2011,"Rocky V was a decent movie but it is by far the worst of the franchise. Stallone's accent sounded a lot thicker in this one then the other movies; which gets annoying. Rocky's son aged three years after the fourth Rocky even though the fifth takes place right after the fight. i liked the story it was cool to see Rocky manage a fighter. The movie could have been a lot better. I don't think Sage was that great as the son. The last fight had this slow motion sequence which was terrible. I liked the flashbacks in the film. Tommy Morrison did an okay job as the villain. Compared to the other Rocky's though Apollo, Clubber, and Drago were all tougher then Morrison. So it didn't seem like much of ending for the franchise. As a movie by itself it is okay but compared with rest its not. I am glad Stallone made Rocky Balboa and ended it on a higher note.",Rocky V
259,jarrian-jefferson74,"Well, it's a Sequel, Folks...",5,26 February 2012,"...and just like with any other sequel of an award-winning classic like the original Rocky, expectations are high and it gets harder and harder to create anything original. However, this film is a departure from the previous films in that Rocky is actually a trainer throughout most of the film. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as a kid, but as an adult some parts of it are simply laughable.For example, the boxing matches are horribly choreographed (as practically all the Rocky films are), making it seem like professional boxers simply take turns slugging each other, with an occasional slipped punch or two for variation. This is surprising, seeing that an actual boxer, Tommy Morrison, co-starred in this film. Some of the music in the film is kinda corny, but that could be said for some of the previous soundtracks as well.Overall, the typical Rocky themes are present here that are in the previous Rocky films. Rocky has to deal with betrayal in this installment of the franchise, and we get to see what we already knew about Balboa from the previous films: his character is just as strong as his iron will, which is one of the reasons this franchise has captured our imagination.",Rocky V
260,iamvrun,"yo adrian, i love it",9,3 June 2012,"Really surprised after watching this amazing movie.This movie is surely my favorite rocky movie and i think this is Stallone's best performance in any rocky series taken into consideration. Many scenes in this movie which forced me to make my fist fold really tight. My adrenaline pumped up and specially the relation between rocky and Robert is really touching. When u see father treating his son so good after realizing his fault. I even loved the relation between rocky and Paulie. It shows reflection with my friend who behaves exactly like Paulie. This is the movie that made me pen IMDb for first time. At last I am sure one will find every good stuff by which a very good movie is made of. Yo ADRIAN, I LOVE IT.",Rocky V
261,mozalcin,Better than Rocky IV,5,24 January 2006,"First and foremost, this film was never going to get any good press no matter what, that has to be said. Stallone had become about as fashionable as flared trousers after all the Rambo movies and at the time was a character there to be mocked. Sometimes we need to watch a movie years later to maybe give it its fair dues. Rocky V was by no means a terrible movie and for me certainly better than Rocky IV, which seems very naff when you watch it now. Rocky V tried too hard to get back the atmosphere of Rocky and Rocky II and Balboa dressing in his old style clothes was just too much. A decent soundtrack was also missing. Taken on their own, some scenes were actually quite well acted, like Tommy Gunn thanking Duke instead of Balboa, having just become world champion. Overall, average movie..",Rocky V
262,mamadomasr,"one of the best movies ever, terribly under rated",10,14 March 2018,"Rocky spirit is an inspiration to me. I loved all the rocky sequel but when I was younger I didn't like this one and I used to think this is the worst Rocky movie. but today I've grown old, I'm 37 years old father when I saw this movie today I've seen myself in the mirror of Rocky the father and old fighter. this magnificent movie is very very underrated. I gave it than 10 stars and it deserves more.",Rocky V
263,lutzja-886-660287,After years of hating this movie...I'm surprised!,7,8 May 2020,"I was a massive fan of the Rocky films as a kid, and I used to hate this one. I used to marathon these movies every thanksgiving and would always stop after the fourth film. Recently though, I had the urge to rewatch them out of nostalgia and almost skipped over V, but I'm glad I didn't. Being older and watching them back to back I think It's a great close the the original anthology, focusing on his life after fighting and all the problems that come with it. It goes more into his personal life and the problems that come after hanging up the gloves. Obviously it's still pretty cheesy, but I think it stays true to the feeling of the previous four films.",Rocky V
264,albo18,Complete crap from beginning to end....,3,12 March 2005,"The story was there; Rocky can no longer fight, and his financial position shatters, forcing him and his family to move back to the Philidelphia ghetto from which they came. Rocky must find a way to support his family as well as keep it together with the new pressures of poverty pulling it apart.Then it all goes to hell.....The acting is at a cheesy soap opera level at best. Rocky's son, is particularly annoying.The man who plays Tommy Gunn is worse than Dolph Lundgren as an Ivan Drago. At least with Dolph, playing a robotic Soviet Super-Athlete, his robotic acting actually helped with the role. Watching Tommy prance around the screen leaping and begging for a fight like a hyper active dog gets progressively more and more annoying as time goes on. He is proof that athletes (He was a professional boxer) sometimes should generally not be cast in major roles. And seriously, who the hell came up with that name? I've noticed that everyone applaudes Stallone for not having Rocky come back and fight another opponent. I ask them if they've actually managed to watch the film to the end? Rocky beats the living hell out of Tommy in a street fight in which Rocky receives about 20 blows to the head, which he was asked to avoid because according to the docs, the next punch would kill him. I guess they were wrong, screw continuity. Yes, Gunn wasn't an impossible foe, but the fact that Rocky was one step away from a brain hemmhorage makes it just pathetically unbelievable.I recommend you watch Rocky 1 and 2, and leave it at that if you can. They made up a fine story with good continuity....If you want hilarious camp, watch 4....Talk about American propaganda...If you want stupidity though.....watch 3 And if you want complete crap from beginning to end, watch 5....",Rocky V
265,tmmpl,Rocky 5 is great,8,6 February 2007,"I want to firstly say that this is the second best rocky, with rocky 1 being the top. Rocky 5 is about more than boxing, its about remembering where you came from and helping people out (rocky helped tommy be no.1). Stallone played the role perfectly- when you watch the rocky's 1-5 you can see how much the character has grown. For me the best part of the entire films is the flashback with rocky and mickey, i have never seen a flashback done as well and i never will, the flash back shows us how much mickey loved rocky, they were like father and son. When the flashbacks kept going back to rocky standing in the gym alone was fantastic, it showed us that rocky remembered everything that mickey said to him, when it went back to rocky say ""you were the angel"" with tears in his eyes it was the greatest acting i have seen from Sylvester. This film showed me that no matter if someone is gone that they still live inside you and they can still help you when you need it the most by remembering what they said to you in life (mickey helped rocky when tommy knocked him out). On a final note i beg everyone till watch rocky 5 again and rate it on the story, acting, etc and i bet that you will have a much higher opinion of it.",Rocky V

ARE YOU F**CKING STUPID OR WHAT. It definitely deserves 7+. It's something which is totally different, something with emotions, something that don't just show fights. If you haven't watched it or gonna skip because of ratings then don't. Classical Rocky isn't complete without 5th part.",Rocky V

268,KCPrime,Character flaws,1,26 June 2012,"Rocky V was a major disappointment in the Rocky series. While I could be here for days trying to address the flaws in this film (you can read the many other negative reviews for that), I'm going to address the biggest problem I had with the movie. The character development was all wrong.First of all, let's discuss Rocky. I think Rocky had reached a certain maturity as the series progressed from Rocky I to Rocky IV. In Rocky V, he seemed to have reverted back to his younger personality. Now, I would say this is because he has returned to his Philly roots, but the flawed character was evident from the very beginning of the movie, before the family's financial woes. Don't get me wrong, I loved Rocky I and found the Rocky character very likable. If the intention of this movie was to bring out his younger personality, it was done poorly. All the maturity Rocky had acquired through his many trials and tribulations totally went out the window for no reason. Granted, losing your wealthy lifestyle is a major change, but your not going to totally change your personality.I also had a major problem with Adrian's character. She was a completely different person and her chemistry with Rocky did not show in this movie. In Rocky V she suddenly becomes very assertive, even when dealing with the press and in public situations. This is totally contrary to the reserved, shy character we had known previously. I think this change in character was a big reason the chemistry between her and Rocky did not work. The moments Rocky and Adrian got into heated conversations became special, intimate moments in the previous installments. Those moments had no effect on me in Rocky V. The shyness of her character was integral to making those moments special, because when Adrian did come out of her shell it was usually only with Rocky in a private moment.It became very hard for me to buy into this story line because of these character flaws. I just couldn't get over it. I'm going to pretend this movie never happened. Rocky V? Never happened!",Rocky V

270,robinleach-32641,"Trust me, it's great!",8,8 May 2020,"Now I didn't figure I would write a review on this movie... But upon seeing how bad reviews it has, I feel the need to. Now I don't have any nostalgic feelings toward these movies since I just saw em' with my dad and I must say these are all great movies. But the last 3 and 4 got kinda ""bad"" to over the top in my opinion. At that point it was about the fights and not the story, and that's why people love Rocky... I think we all fell in love with Rocky and his loveable character, not the ""fights"", ofc they were the highligt but the reason we carred about them was because we carred about Rocky. And the 3 and 4 lost that care for Rocky. That's why I love the 5th, I think it went back to the roots. It's all about Rocky again, and it makes us care about him again. It's all story and his son get's to be a more interesting character, Paulie shows a likeable side and the old location. I think most hate on it because they have nostalgic feelings about the first one. They want the same movie again but better... and that's not possible there will never be the old Rocky again... But I think this movie comes close. As I said it's a great movie and I think this is the 3rd best movie in the series. My only problems with it is Tommy, I don't think he's a great enemy he's kinda bland and just angry for the sake of being angry... He's kinda a flawed character to be honest, and the last thing was it was to predictable. I think everyone who saw it knew Tommy was gonna turn on him and that they would have to fight... But else amazing!!!
Watch it!",Rocky V
271,jackolack,Underrated but still flawd,7,29 September 2021,"People really don't like this movie, I get why, for example: the street fight, how it's weird how rocky got brain damage, his relationship with his son, and how rocky is dence to others emotions. Now I'll defend some of the points. The street fight was different and felt real, but I would've wanted a ring fight too, the brain damage and him being dence to emotions was a result of him not gaurding his head from punches, I like this movie but it is flaud.",Rocky V
272,sweeteeboo,"Correction to ""Bob the Moo's"" posting.",10,16 January 2006,"In response from the last posting from ""Bob the Moo""...Rocky did not return to New York when he became bankrupt. Rocky is from Philadelphia. He returned to Philadelphia in Rocky V. Anyone from Philadelphia, as myself, love the Rocky movies. He's our own hometown hero...even if he is only a movie character. :)Rocky return to the streets of Philadelphia bankrupt. His family struggles with adjusting to life back in city neighborhood of Kensington. Rocky tries to make the best of it and keep his family's spirits high, however Rocky misses the ring. Rocky had been instructed by doctors not to fight but he misses his sport. Rocky meets an up and coming boxer who looks to Rocky for guidance. Rocky trains him and treats him as his family only to be betrayed by the young Tommy Gunn for fast money and fame. In the end the two come head to head with the ungrateful Tommy provoking Rocky into a fight. Although we all know Rocky always wins it still gives us locals the goosebumps seeing Rocky triumph in every type of situation.Currently, Rocky Balboa (6th installment) is being filmed in Philadelphia. We Philadelphia natives will, as always, be the first in line for the debut!!!",Rocky V
273,sarawhyte,"Totally underrated, a great film for real fans",10,29 June 2018,I was so surprised by this movie. I'm making my way through the Rocky films in anticipation of the seventh installment coming this fall and I was expecting V to be terrible based on the reviews. I was blown away! This film gets back to the character development and writing of the first two movies and is much better than the two before it. Maybe the reviews at the time were bad because people thought this was the last one? I could see why that may make it feel unsatisfying. But give this film a chance. It's brilliant.,Rocky V
