0,Leofwine_draca,"A bit 'digital' at times, but otherwise enjoyable",6,18 March 2018,"THE NOVEMBER MAN is another tough-guy vehicle for Pierce Brosnan, who has been really excelling in the thriller genre when taken out of his overblown Bond movies. Here he plays an assassin forced to do battle with his own protege when a corrupt Russian politician brings chaos to Europe. The film marks a re-teaming for Brosnan and director Roger Donaldson after their excellent DANTE'S PEAK and while it's not as good as that movie, this isn't bad at all. The main problem I had with it is that it has a cheap, digital look at times and the use of CGI blood and the like is pretty poor. Otherwise, this is a compelling BOURNE-style story with narrative that's complex enough to keep you watching. Brosnan is as smooth and suave as ever and Australian actor Luke Bracey does well in support. There's also a fine turn from the surprisingly good Olga Kurylenko, who is better here than she ever was in QUANTUM OF SOLACE.",The November Man
1,SnoopyStyle,good start but flounders,5,29 May 2015,"In 2008, Peter Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) runs an operation with David Mason (Luke Bracey) which leaves a child dead. Five years later, he is recruited to bring a woman out of Russia. She has information on leading Russian politician Federov. She gives Devereaux the name Mira Filipova and is killed by Mason. Mason and Devereaux are shocked to face each other at a standoff. Devereaux rescues refugee worker Alice Fournier (Olga Kurylenko) from a Russian assassin and the CIA as she joins Devereaux to find Filipova. It's all to cover up a secret operation to start the second Chenchen conflict.This starts good as an espionage thriller with a touch Bourne action. The movie loses me about midway through. Instead of staying with the heighten intensity, it slows down with a romance. Luke Bracey is not charismatic enough to provide the other half of the movie. Then there is the over-arching evil plan in this movie. I'm not saying it's not evil. It would be more compelling if the cover-up is for a small country. Then it would be the big bad CIA manipulating a small country. The narrative of the CIA screwing over Russia is not a terrible revelation. I'm not sure it's that easy to root for killing all those CIA agents if all they did was screw over Russia. This starts so well but it flounders towards the end.",The November Man
2,Prismark10,Everything dies,5,17 September 2019,"The November Man feels like a reheated spy action film. A second rate Bond with some added touch of a John Le Carre conspiracy. It offers nothing much that is new or exciting.Peter Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) is a CIA agent that called it quits in 2008 after a botched job when his young reckless protege Mason (Luke Bracey) shoots a child dead.Five years later Devereaux is brought out from the cold by his handler Hanley (Bill Smitrovich.) He has to protect a Russian informant who has the dirt on the next would be president of Russia, that he once plotted with the CIA.Events go south as the informant is killed. Devereaux now needs to unravel the conspiracy which might lead to his employers and is now hunted by a Russian assassin as well as Mason.There are shades of The Mechanic as Devereaux has to face off with the younger rival that he trained and who has taken his place at the agency. The film displays some appalling sexism. Hanley makes an off colour slur on a female that should had been left in the cutting room floor. Another female character has to don a gratuitous revealing costume to get near her mark.This is a thriller made on a modest budget. It is all shot in some East European country. There are enough action and thrills to make this a serviceable film with a few well worn twists. You just know that both Brosnan and director Roger Donaldson once made bigger budget and better films.",The November Man
3,claudio_carvalho,Complex and Great Spy Thriller,7,19 July 2015,"In Lausanne, Switzerland, the retired CIA agent Peter Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) is visited by his former chief John Hanley (Bill Smitrovich) that convinces him to extract the agent Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musliovic) from Russia. Natalia is the assistant of the Russian candidate for President Arkady Federov (Lazar Ristovski) and has collected evidences of war crimes committed by the candidate during the Chechen War and requested Peter to help her. However, during the operation, CIA chief Perry Weinstein (William Patton) believes that Natalie has been captured by the Russians and orders agent David Mason (Luke Bracey) to kill her. Natalie gives photos and the name Mira Filipova to Peter before dying and the agent informs Hanley. Peter kills the CIA agents, but when he sees Mason, he spares the agent that was trained by him. When Mason meets Weinstein, he learns that Peter and Natalie had a love affair in the past and the agent is assigned to kill him. Peter heads to Belgrade where he saves the social worker Alice Fournier (Olga Kurylenko) that might know where Mira is from Federov's assassin Alexa (Amila Terzimehic) and from Mason. Soon Peter learns dirty secrets about Arkady Federov and the CIA and has to flee with Alice to save their lives and expose the crimes to the world.""The November Man"" is a complex and great spy thriller with a story with many twists. I saw this film on DVD and immediately after finishing watching it, I saw it again to fully understand the story. The fast pace associated to the twists make the viewer lose details that can be better understood in a second time. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""November Man: Um Espião Nunca Morre"" (""November Man""A Spy Never Dies"")",The November Man
4,nogodnomasters,WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU?,8,5 September 2018,"Peter Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) is a super spy, retired. He worked for the CIA and trained David Mason (Luke Bracey). A former Russian General named Federov (Lazar Ristovski) is poised to become Russia's next president. A woman who was next to him under deep cover has damaging information on Federov and wants to be extracted. Peter shows up from out of retirement to help out...things go awry.Peter now needs to find a girl (Olga Kurylenko) who has the information before the Russians or CIA do, as both want her dead. David, who was trained by Peter, is part of the CIA that wants him dead, although he has mixed loyalties. The film is interesting as Peter stays one step ahead of David as he knows how he was trained. The question as to why the CIA wants people dead is a mystery that is revealed 44 minutes into the film. The name ""November Man"" is explained 8 minutes from the end of the film or the first 10 seconds of the preview. Amila Terzimehic plays a Russian assassin whose role I would have loved to have seen expanded.Alice: "" Do all of your friends try to kill you?""
Peter: ""Eventually.""An interesting spy thriller, a bit formulaic, but worth a view.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, and of course stripper nudity.",The November Man
5,kosmasp,Fall,6,22 December 2014,"Mr. Brosnan is key. Not the only key obviously looking at the cast, but his charisma and his personality shine through and make this better than it actually is. It's not that the script is bad, but it's like been there and done that. Is it the movies fault, that we are used to movies like that? It's tough to say, but even if you haven't you can tell that there must be better executed movies out there.Having said all that, it's still worth a watch if you like thrillers peppered with action. The story is simple and should not stand in the way. Nor the fact, that you will figure out who's who and where this is heading. Enjoy the ride if you can and watch it with that in mind",The November Man
6,classicsoncall,"""So all your friends try to kill you?""",7,31 August 2021,"""The November Man"" starts out as a reasonably effective espionage thriller but loses it's way in it's scramble to the finale. I liked Pierce Brosnan in this one, you could have hung the name Bond on him and pretty much had the same story. There's a cat and mouse game set up in the story line between Peter Devereaux (Brosnan) and former protégé David Mason (Luke Bracey), who inadvertently killed a young civilian on a mission five years prior. Not following orders earned Mason a negative evaluation by Devereaux, though it didn't harm his eventual status in the CIA, since Mason is now on a hit squad targeting Devereaux's wife and Devereaux himself. The plotting gets a little murky in the lead up to the finale, when it's revealed that Devereaux's handler Hanley (Bill Smitrovich) was in league with a Russian politician (Lazar Ristovski) angling for the Presidency. A decade earlier they orchestrated the destruction of a building that killed Americans to kick off the second Chechnyan war. It's unclear to me why Mason made the save on Devereaux's twelve year old daughter, though it probably had to do with Hanley's double dealing, something a repeat viewing might clear up but I'm just not that interested. Keep you eyes on Russian actress Olga Kurylenko, who undergoes a variety of character switches in the picture, though it always puzzles me how a relatively meek character starting out is able to turn into a deadly assassin in a short period of time.",The November Man
7,rmax304823,Everybody Spies Once In A While.,5,30 April 2017,"You can generally tell how closely an action movie adhered to generic conventions by how long it takes to get to the first high-speed pursuit. The car chase here begins at about the twenty minute mark. Strictly routine.Pierce Brosnan is a retired CIA agent who is called back to duty by his nationalist fervor and his high moral sense. Another CIA agent, by whom Brosnan has had a daughter, has been uncovered by the Russkies and must be saved. Brosnan doesn't succeed in his mission. The woman is seated next to him in a car when her chest is punctured by a bullet from a distant rifle. The man who fired the bullet is Luke Bracey, a young CIA man who is just following orders and who was trained to do so by Brosnan in his earlier incarnation.A feud now exists between them. It's cat and mouse. It's eye for eye. It's tooth for tooth. It's quid for quo. It's two for a penny.The feud adds tension but the tension is misplaced because the REAL villains aren't those whom you might expect. I won't give away their identities except to say that one is Bill Smitrovich, the CIA chief in Belgrade, where the story takes place; the other is Lazar Ristovski, a candidate for president of the Russian confederation. They get their just desserts.The principals in the movie stay in the elegant Hotel Imperial in Belgrade. I stayed in Belgrade for a while, too, but in the cheapest shabbiest hotel I could find. I developed these tiny red lesions which my companion, a medical student, claimed looked like insect bites. One night, in the course of rolling over, I happened to glance at the pillow where half a dozen bed bugs had nestled under my head. Now, I don't just offer this as a colorful anecdote but as a prelude to some advice of momentous importance: If you must stay in Belgrade, stay in the Hotel Imperial.Brosnan is okay, and Olga Kurylenko is positively magnetic, what with her plump lips and startling periwinkle blue irises. Luke Bracey is a good-enough looking young man. He looks like a movie star. But his delivery is pale and weak. Lazar Ristovski does a good job as the corrupt sex maniac who starts the Chechin War. Smitrovich is so repulsive in every respect that he, or his bald presence, seems to infect the screen. Amila Terzimehic is a hit woman who has had ballet training and whose nose is as long and threatening as her pistol, the one with the lengthy noise suppressor attached. It's confusing, filled with action, and violently routine.",The November Man
8,blanche-2,disappointing,6,21 April 2015,"I like this genre, and I like Pierce Brosnan, but ""November Man"" didn't past muster for me. It's a middling spy thriller with enough explosions, car chases, and shootings to make people who like that sort of thing happy. To me, it felt like that's all there was.Brosnan is Peter Devereaux, an ex-CIA agent asked by his old boss (Bill Smitrovich) to extract a woman undercover in Russia. She is presently very close to a man running for President (Lazar Ristovski), who committed crimes during the Chechen war. She has a connection to the person, Alice Fournier, who can give them the proof they need to bring him down.They need to extract her before she is found out, but she will only allow Devereaux to do it. Peter travels to Russia, actually just as she's discovered, but she is shot and killed as they are driving away. She does, however, give Peter the name.Peter goes after the killer, but the leader (Luke Bracey) turns out to be someone he trained, meaning that the CIA is involved.Peter then searches for Alice Fournier (Olga Kurylenko), whose family were victims of the candidate, realizing that she must be protected. The almost-President is killing everyone who can talk about his past.Lots of action but not much human connection in this film. The acting is okay, with Kurylenko reminding me a lot of Catherine Zeta-Jones. Brosnan seemed a little tired for this part.So-so.",The November Man
9,Hey_Sweden,"You can be a human, or a killer of humans, but not both.",7,14 March 2021,"Pierce Brosnan is back in the spy game, and proves to be in good form, in this adaptation of the novel ""There Are No Spies"" by Bill Granger. Brosnan plays Peter Devereaux, a.k.a. ""The November Man"". He's a former C.I.A. agent recruited back into service when an associate (Mediha Musliovic) turns up with information that incriminates a Russian politician (Lazar Ristovski) running for President. Although it hardly needs to be said, not everything in the developing scenario is how it appears to be. Much violence ensues is Devereaux is pitted against a former protegee, David Mason (Luke Bracey) who doesn't always follow orders to the letter.The cat-and-mouse game between Devereaux and Mason is one solid element of this engaging, if not exemplary, example of the international-intrigue action-thriller genre. Fortunately, filmmaker Roger Donaldson, reunited with Brosnan 17 years after ""Dante's Peak"", guides this entertaining story in style. The use of various Serbian and Montenegro locations is first-rate, the violence is pretty intense, the women are gorgeous, Brosnan is backed up by a strong supporting cast, and the pace remains pretty consistent. Adding some gravitas is the context of the tale, involving old war crimes in Chechnya. Now, the story IS predictable more often than not, and it does traffic in some cliches, but while it's playing out for a reasonably exciting 109 minutes, most viewers likely won't mind a lot. Bracey is fine as the young agent out to prove himself, Olga Kurylenko is appealing as the imperiled Alice Fournier, Amila Terzimehic is amusing as a relentless hitwoman, and American veteran actors Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton do credible jobs as a jovial colleague and a cold-eyed, bureaucratic senior agent.""The November Man"" is good fun: maybe not a classic that will be remembered years from now, but it does show its audience a pretty good time overall.Seven out of 10.",The November Man
10,LeonLouisRicci,Spy vs SpyLow Budget and Old SchoolEfficient and Violent,7,27 May 2015,"A Spy Thriller that's got a Bit of a Bite. A Modestly Budgeted B-Movie of Sorts that doesn't try to be an Epic SFX Extravaganza like the Bond/Bourne Series. It is rather Short and Trimmed for Maximum Efficiency and Hardly Resembles the Aforementioned Franchises.But its Roots, no doubt, lie in the Pierce Brosnan as Bond Films and without even trying its Links are Apparent. The Bond Films are so Ingrained in Movie Audiences that No Reference or Embellishment is Needed for Viewers to Immediately Identify Brosnan's Mr. Devereaux as a Retired Bond with Another Name.So no matter how Many Times the Name Deveraux is Mentioned, it is an Aging, Paunchy, Bitter Mr. Bond that the Audience is Following around this Routine, but Effective Flash Forward. The Villains are Nasty and the ""Good Guys"" are Exposed for what They are and get the required Comeuppance.The Bond Girl, eh sorry. the Girl in this one is the Alluring Olga Kurylenko, and She Helps the Film along, not only as Eye Candy but is Integral to the Story and Engages Excitedly. Overall, an Above Average Entertainment with a Hard-Boiled Edge and is Satisfying, if not on the Level of the Bond/Bourne/John Le Carre Stuff that Frequents Filmland.",The November Man
11,zardoz-13,One of Brosnan's Best Action Thrillers,9,28 November 2014,"Ironically, former James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan plays a veteran C.I.A. agent in ""The November Man"" who finds himself drawn inextricably back into the European spy game. Earlier, Brosnan and ""Sleeping Dogs"" director Roger Donaldson collaborated on the entertaining 1997 disaster epic ""Dante Peak,"" that can neither match the velocity nor the body count of this swiftly-paced, above-average, shoot'em up that pits our formidable protagonist against both Russian Intelligence as well as his own former employers from Langley. Mind you, Donaldson is no stranger to espionage epics; he helmed ""The Recruit"" with Al Pacino and Colin Farrell as well as ""No Way Out"" with Gene Hackman and Kevin Costner. ""No Way Out"" is marginally better than ""The November Man,"" but unquestionably this lively R-rated thriller ranks as Brosnan's best picture since his farewell 007 outing ""Die Another Day."" ""The November Man"" boasts brisk violence, with Brosnan shooting at least ten opponents dead on the spot. Ostensibly, scenarists Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek adapted Bill Granger's novel ""There Are No Spies,"" and Donaldson and they keep you guessing throughout its exciting, 108-minute sizzler with sensational scenery.A high ranking C.I.A. official, John Hanley (Bill Smitrovich of ""Intelligence Day""), visits Peter Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) at his Switzerland coffee shop and persuades our hero to pull one last job in Eastern Europe. He is supposed to aid and abet an undercover agent, Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musliovic of ""Estrellita""), who plans to flee from Russia. As it turns out, Natalia possesses some vitally important intelligence about the future leader of Russia, Arkady Federov (Lazar Ristovski of ""Casino Royale""),that the C.I.A. desperately wants to land its collective claws. Donaldson frames the action in a story about a mentor and his student. Devereaux has been teaching a young agent, Mason (Luke Bracey of ""G.I. Joe: Retaliation""), who is loyal at best impetuous at worst. Devereaux struggles to suppress Mason's impulsive quality. In an early scene, Devereaux suits himself up with body armor and masquerades as an American ambassador. Devereaux exposes himself to an assassin, and Mason manages to cut down the assassin. Unfortunately, a small girl dies during the shooting as a consequence of the assassin's wild shots. Devereaux retires not long afterward and recommends that Mason be dropped. Devereaux opens a restaurant in Switzerland when Hanley shows up with folders containing photos of dead agents. As it turns out, Devereaux knows Natalia, and they have a secret history. After she narrowly escapes from Federov's office with sensitive information that would not only incriminate Federov for war crimes, but also the C.I.A., Natalia finds herself about to die when Devereaux materializes miraculously, guns down her pursuers, and gives her a lift. However, things take a sudden turn for the worst. Devereaux's former student, Mason, puts a bullet in Natalia's chest. Before she dies, the fatally wounded Natalia utters the name ""Mira Filipova"" and gives Devereaux her cell phone with incriminating photos of Federov with young girls. An angry Devereaux tracks down the C.I.A. crew to a garage and ambushes them when they exit it. He kills all of them except Mason. Inexplicably, Devereaux and Mason stare at each other over their pistols in a tableau out of a John Woo movie and then walk away from each other. Eventually, most everything ties back to a mysterious woman, refugee case worker Alice Fournier (Olga Kurylenko of ""Quantum of Solace""), who knew the girl who saw Federov execute her family during the Chechen War. Now that he knows a New York Times reporter is trying to expose him and the journalist plans to interview Fournier, Federov assigns a lethal Russian assassin, Alexa (newcomer Amila Terzimehic), who is an agile gymnast in her own right. She wears her hair in a woven pony tail that resembles a flattened scorpion's stinger. She has no qualms about killing in cold blood and proves to be a dangerous adversary.If you liked Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, you'll probably enjoy him as ""The November Man."" This movie contains several surprises that will often catch you off-guard.",The November Man
12,oscaralbert,"The truth about James Bond, Agent 007 finally comes out . . .",8,4 September 2014,". . . and perceptive movie goers should have little trouble figuring out what's what, even if copyright concerns demand that some of the names be changed to protect the residual value of Britain's fourth leading industry (Bond flicks). It turns out that Pierce Brosnan\James VI (if you count David Niven) is actually a CIA agent named Peter H. Devereaux. (This explains why James always seems to spend more time than Jack Bauer in looking out for American interests, and never gives a second thought to securing Stonehenge.) N0VEMBER MAN also discloses that Agent 007 was sort of a subcontractor involved in starting the Second Chechan War, which explains why well-informed Muslims hate us. Hopefully, ISIS, Al-Qaida, Hezbollah, and their ilk will not pick up on N0VEMBER MAN's full disclosures, and redirect their subway\railway attacks from Britain and Russia toward the U.S. After all, why give these terrorists further fodder to lop off any additional heads?",The November Man

15,ferguson-6,Shaken Not Stirred,5,31 August 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. Somewhere there must exist a checklist of the main plot lines for all the spy thrillers and action films ever made. Should you wonder what's on the checklist, then this is the movie for you. Ambition it does not lack. Striving to be an edgy Bond flick, an action-packed Bourne thriller, and a complex Le Carre mind-twister, the film, unfortunately, excels at none of these ... though does manage to be entertaining enough for the pre-fall dead zone.Pierce Brosnan stars as a retired CIA operative called back into duty 5 years after a mission gone bad (seen courtesy of flashback). His boss is played by the always interesting character actor Bill Smitrovich, but we are supposed to buy in fully to the mentor vs protégé story line of Brosnan and Luke Bracey (the next in a long line of hunky Aussies).Geopolitics, inner-office power plays, and mistaken identity all come into play, as do the innocent neighbor, an imperiled young daughter and backroom deals between the CIA and a Russian President-elect. All of this plus a quietly creepy assassin played by extremely limber gymnast Amila Terzimehic, a revenge-seeking (former Bond girl) Olga Kurylenko playing dress up, the rarely seen/scene-stealing Will Patton, car chases and crashes, gun fights, fist fights, knife fights, computer tracking and sneaky drones. Of course, all of these are on the aforementioned checklist.Director Roger Donaldson has a varied career with such films as No Way Out, Cocktail, The World's Fastest Indian (highly recommended), and The Bank Job. This film is based on Bill Granger's Devereaux novel ""There Are No Spies"". Donaldson's eye for action sequences are a plus, but the key here is Mr. Brosnan. He brings an edge that his James Bond never could ... he even yells a few times! However, as with most movies, the script makes or breaks, and in this case the plausibility test is badly flunked.",The November Man
16,anaconda-40658,Brosnan's Back!,8,11 September 2015,"November Man (2014): Dir: Roger Donaldson / Cast: Pierce Brosnan, Olga Kurrylenko, Luke Bracey, Bill Smitrovich, Lazar Ristovski: The title is referenced through dialogue and it suggests that this CIA agent, played by Pierce Brosnan, finalizes all encounters with conflict. He plays Peter Devereaux, retired CIA after an assignment goes wrong when a young sniper fails to follow orders. He is called upon years later when sought after to bring another agent, a former lover whom he shares a daughter with, out of Moscow. She is out to expose a Russian politician who was a corrupt army general who forced girls into sex. They are in search of one girl in particular but in the process Devereaux and his ex are ambushed and she is killed. Enraged, he kills all the agents until coming face to face with the young recruit he trained in the film's opening. This is Roger Donaldson's best film since The Bank Job, and the screenplay is detailed and twisted. What works against it is the brutality of the violence, particularly when an innocent woman is intentionally injured by the hero. Brosnan reminds us why he succeeded as James Bond but he is a tad more sadistic here. Olga Kurrylenko plays a contact who hooks up with Devereaux and she seeks revenge on the army general who killed her family. Luke Bracey walks a tightrope as the younger agent placed against Devereaux unbeknownst the true facts. Bill Smitrovich plays a corrupt agent placed under interrogation. Lazar Ristovski plays the Russian presidential candidate who hides cruel practices in the military. The result is a pointless yet well made action film that delivers vintage Brosnan.

18,phd_travel,Entertaining with good leads but convoluted story,7,2 March 2015,This topical action thriller about the CIA and a Russian politician is entertaining. The story is a bit too convoluted and it was hard to follow the rapid twists and turns sometimes. Good on location filming in Belgrade - a city not often seen on film. It's not very big budget but doesn't feel cheap. Olga Kurlyenko is stunning here both when she is simply dressed and without makeup and when she is all dolled up. She deserves more leading roles. Pierce Brosnan proves he can still do action well. He has kept trim. and he is a better looking Bond than Daniel Craig. Australian actor Luke Bracey is alright not as glamorous as a Hemsworth so maybe more convincing in this role.Worth one watch.,The November Man
19,gradyharp,"'You can be a human, or a killer of humans, but not both.'",8,3 January 2015,"Based on Bill Granger's book ""There Are No Spies' and adapted for the screen by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek, THE November MAN has all the ingredients for a James Bondesque adventure film – even using a previous Bon (Pierce Brosnan) as the lead character. Roger Donaldson directs and at times confusing mélange of events but in the end the film lives up to the standards of foreign intrigue thriller.The cast is an international one and everyone fills the duties assigned to a T. Of special note is new Australian hunk Luke Bracey (who needs to hit the gym.), a welcome newcomer for the secondary lead roles that result in stardom. Peter Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) is a former CIA super spy, retired. He worked for the CIA and trained David Mason (Luke Bracey). Peter is asked by the man he worked for to extract a woman (Olga Kurylenko) who is in Russia and is presently close to a man Arkady Federov (Lazar Ristovski) running for President, who is believed to have committed crimes during the Chechen war. She can give them the name of someone who can prove it. His friend says that she will only come to him. So he goes and she gets the info and tries to get out but the man finds out and tries to stop her. Peter arrives and saves her but as they are getting away they're shot at. She is killed but tells Peter the name before she dies. Peter kills the men who attacked them but when he sees the leader, Mason (Luke Bracey), a man he trained, he realizes the CIA is involved. He tries to find the person and the only one who might know where she is is Alice Fournier, the social worker who helped her when she came to the West. A CIA bigwig (Bill Smitrovich) steps in and orders that Devereaux be taken off the case and wants Mason to take care of it. The Presidential candidate sends an assassin to make sure no one wrecks his chances of becoming President.

What did not work: Predictable story where the C I A is the bad guys. Seen it done it before. Some of the non-original story line reminds me of James Bond, maybe because of Pierce Bronsnan.

21,deloudelouvain,The usual spy thriller,7,13 March 2015,"When you start watching a movie like this one you already exactly know what you are going to see. A lot of action, shootings, highly trained secret agents that are able to avoid being hit once by a bullet, other highly trained secret agents that get immediately shot by the hero of the story without them hitting anybody despite being highly trained, a lot of fight scenes were the hero can get hit severely without any major injuries while he only has to give one punch to disable somebody for good, car pursuits, double crossed agents, corrupt politicians etc... Everyone knows it and still everybody watches it. I did it also because sometimes I like that kind of movie, with a lot of action, and still knowing that everything is going to be very exaggerated. The story is okay with enough twists to keep you entertained. The actors are all good, even though I have difficulties to see Brosnan as a killer. To me he just has not the profile. Nevertheless it's an okay movie if you like that kind of genre.",The November Man
22,siderite,Old James Bond and his family,7,8 November 2014,"The November Man is the first book in the series, but the film is adapted from the seventh, There Are No Spies. An entire marketing castling has been done in order to rename the books to match the name of the film, as well. I haven't read any of the books, though, so I can't comment on the connection between the original material and the film.That being said, I really liked Pierce Brosnan as James Bond and in this film it seemed like he just went back into that role. I don't know if that was Granger's intended character, though. The plot was so and so, with occasional glimpses of good ideas in a rather sub par soup of clichés. Another James Bond cast member, Olga Kurylenko, just looks gorgeous, even if her character is mostly the classic damsel in distress, always shocked by violence and doing stupid things so that she can be rescued.Bottom line: a solid action film, but the characterization really just went all over the place, as did the story. Even the title of the film needs to be explained in a pointless scene at the end. It comes off as a film of inconsistent quality, oscillating from bad to above average, the result being just ""yet another"" in the genre. Also, it was probably too difficult to adapt a 1979 book to the modern technology and spycraft, so it feels really dated.",The November Man

There is some gratuitous sex and nudity. Is it a great film? No it is a good film as much of it has been done before, sometimes better, some times worse.Still, the cast brings it off pretty well and most of the film is good. It does get a little too twisted and convoluted near the end and then the ending is rather predictable. Still it is great to see a cast that does very well and a good script as there is always room for that kind of entertainment. After a private showing of the film, without distraction, I got a pretty good idea that this one will not be lasting too much longer first run so grab a ticket and go. Do not look for much humor here, this film takes the story very seriously.",The November Man

The story is alright, but I feel that in the hands of a better director and bigger budget this one could have stood out from the other action movies. Because some parts just came off corny and lame, and it just didn't seem necessary. Certain parts of the movie just sort of came off laughable, despite it being serious scenes. The acting goes from passable to worse though. It's actually however nice to see Pierce Brosnan back in the action scene, despite his age. Pierce Brosnan character is actually a somewhat comples andinteresting ex-spy. I like movies where certain characters aren't black and white, and the ambiguous side works for this movie. Overall this is a watchable and yet forgettable spy action flick.6.8/10",The November Man
25,Hellmant,I'd say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.,7,19 September 2014,"'THE November MAN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Spy thriller starring Pierce Brosnan as an ex-CIA agent who must take on an old pupil, when his former employers kill the woman he loves and target him for assassination. The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton. I found it to be pretty entertaining and surprisingly dark, and violent, but still nothing too new or interesting to offer fans of the genre.Brosnan plays Peter Devereaux; an ex-CIA agent who retired after a student of his, David Mason (Bracey), accidentally killed a kid (while the two were doing an assignment together in Montenegro). Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.The story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto",The November Man

27,Robert_duder,A brilliant spy thriller that floored my expectations,8,29 December 2014,"I have always been a fan of Pierce Brosnan since growing up on Remington Steel but he hasn't had a hit in awhile. I was cautiously hopeful for this film although I had never seen a trailer. I knew it was an action flick and I wanted to try it but kept putting it off until now. Simply put...Wow. It was an awesome thrill ride. It was full of amazing action scenes, a complex and intriguing story (although I'm still not sure I understand everything about it) and is perfectly put together for its genre. Is it predictable? Perhaps but it is a genre film. It is a spy movie...think The Bourne Identity meets Mission Impossible but with more of a complex story perhaps. Not all of the characters are as good as the lead but they all play a part and is just simply entertaining in all the right ways. I love the action genre but it has changed so much over the last ten years and I feel like not always for the better. In a sea of Super Hero films and CGI laden 3D big budget blockbusters...this felt like a good old fashioned guns blazing action flick. Early on it had the obligatory car chase scene and it was very well done. The film starts high octane and doesn't stop all the way through. It balances story with action nearly perfectly.Pierce Brosnan was born for this role. The former Bond and Remington Steel is very comfortable in this role and his age has not slowed him down. He is completely convincing and riveting to watch. His spy character has very little background given to him but he still has a commanding presence on screen and wields his gun like no ones business. The subplot involving his former protégé turned adversary played by Luke Bracey is brilliant. Bracey is terrific and really grows into his role. The chemistry between he and Brosnan is almost amazing. Its very good and falls just short of really being something. I think the main story sort of gets in the way of that sub-plot and in a way that's unfortunate. Olga Kurylenko is decent as Brosnan's witness that he is protecting. I thought it was very smart of them to leave out any sort of romantic involvement because it wasn't necessary and helped make the movie more riveting to watch. She does seem to stumble through a few scenes and really struggle in the more emotional moments but she does okay. There is very little actual chemistry between her and Brosnan but as mentioned, its not entirely purposeful anyways. A character actor I have always enjoyed, Bill Smitrovich is amazing as the villain. He and Brosnan are electrifying opposite each other and he really has a presence on screen which helps his role a great deal. Supporting cast are all decent but no one really stands out particularly. I think Caterina Scorsone deserves mention because I have always liked her on Private Practice and now Grey's Anatomy and she does well in an unfortunately small role.I'm very, very particular about my action films. I love a certain style (Luc Besson, Simon West, James Cameron) to name a few...but Roger Donaldson deserves a great deal of kudos for this film. I had no idea he has been around for so long and I'm already a fan and didn't realize it from his early work in films like No Way Out and Cocktail. Donaldson handles his action scenes flawlessly. I was on the edge of my seat and he holds nothing back in the gratuitous gore category and I'm good with that too!! Political intrigue, spies facing off, backstabbing, covert operations, kidnapping, world wars...it had everything I could want from a spy thriller. I don't understand why anyone would score this low unless their expectations were completely unreasonable. I think it gives you everything that you would want from this genre of film. It might even end up in my top ten at the end of the year. Its been sort of a light year in my books. The film might not be amazingly unique but entertaining...absolutely...I will watch it again!! 8.5/10",The November Man
28,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"An intricate adventure, but too standard in its execution",4,6 July 2016,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning After a mission went wrong many years ago, professional killers Peter Deveraux (Pierce Brosnan) and his younger protégé David Mason (Luke Bracey) drifted apart. Years later, Deveraux's former boss Hanley (Bill Smitrovich) approaches him for a mission in Belgrade, where the former love of his life is killed en route to meeting up with someone else, by Mason, who's now working for the CIA. Devereaux is drawn in the direction of immigrant lawyer Alice (Olga Kurylenko), who may hold the key to the identity of the person his ex love was going to meet. It's all connected to a conspiracy, involving the CIA, the KGB and Russia's corrupt new presidential hopeful Arkady Federov (Lazar Ristovski.) Now entering the autumn of his life, former Bond star Brosnan is now putting his still considerable, commanding presence to these sorts of lower scale, old fashioned spy thrillers. And so it's fitting that with The November Man, he's pitted with the more mature director Roger Donaldson, whose body of work is about as extensive as his. It's telling about the films apparent lack of exposure that there may not have been much confidence to release it more generally to a younger audience that may not have the patience for it.It's all impressively intricate and complex, like the best of them requiring your full attention and popping up with sufficient twists and turns here and there, but all the same it can't help but feel like a very standard, by the numbers affair in terms of being a spy thriller, going through the motions and various clichés of the genre. Towards the end, it also becomes somewhat over elaborate, meandering about here and there without really having a proper middle and an end.What works in its favour ultimately works against it, an old fashioned spy thriller emerging in a more advanced world, with two senior stars behind it. Still, they're admirable purveyors of their crafts, and on a smaller scale it's easier to appreciate it. **",The November Man

30,dromasca,smart action,7,30 October 2018,"'The November Man' was a pleasant surprise. Spy action movies rely very often on a combination of shadowy international intrigue, choreographed violence and sex in order to attract their specific audiences. The quality of the film directed by Roger Donaldson derives from the fact that its script is better written than the majority of other similar movies, the characters and situations are credible, and there are no big holes of gaffes in the story. A rare case of John Le Carre meeting James Bond if you wish.The hero of the film, Peter Devereax (Pierce Brosnan, who was James Bond for only two movies before being replaced by Daniel Craig) is a retired CIA spy who tries to live as normal a life as retired spies can live. He has a soft spot in his biography which is not known even by his former employers, and when he will be brought back in action for a mission which only he can accomplish, he will become part of a violent drama in which are involved his former bosses and colleagues, and which puts at risk not only his life but also the ones of the beings he loves mostly. The story takes place in Moscow and the Balkans after the fall of the Communism, and the dilemmas faced by the hero are very much similar to the ones faces by the heroes of the novels of John Le Carre: conflicts of generations and values in the spy organizations, loyalty of the 'old boys' to the principles of the war between good and evil and nostalgia for times when the enemy was better defined and known, sacrifices that are required in the personal lives and the immense difficulty to live 'normally'.The fans of action movies will not be disappointed either. There is plenty of action, car chases and shootings which will make them happy. Acting is good, Pierce Brosnan does well his job both in the action scenes as well as when his hero is faced with tough choices, with good replicas from the rest of the team and especially from Olga Kurylenko and Luke Bracey. The weakest part of the film is in my opinion the stereotypical presentation of the Balkans and of the Russians. There may be an excuse in the fact that the story is based on a hero and book series created by Bill Granger in the 1980s and 1990s. A lot has changed since then in the world and in the way spy novels and spy movies scripts are written, and a more nuanced update would have been appropriate for a film made in 2014. Yet, it's a well written, acted and paced movie which is better than the crowd.",The November Man
31,A_Different_Drummer,"1974 ,, you had to be there, SERIOUSLY, you had to be there",4,7 September 2014,"... the year was 1974 and a hard-bitten journalist named Bill Granger decided to follow the trend and write yet another spy novel about a hard-bitten secret agent caught in a web of deceit. This was after all the peak of the cold war and spy themes dominated fiction, film, TV, even cartoons.As it turned it, the November Man was well received and a number were written in the series before it finally fizzled. Critics of the day felt all were considerably above average. Granger had a knack for hard prose because of his background.Flash forward about a quarter-century and you will find an ex-Bond lead with money in his pocket looking for projects he can continue working in, even if the process involves spending some of his own money to catch the plum roles. Which he accomplishes by buying the rights to one of the later books in the Granger Series and re-naming the project after the very first book in the series .. see? And so kind reader here we are in 2014 with a project written in the late 20th century, upgraded on a shoestring, mis-named, and spawned with the sole intention of giving its greying star a payday.What can possibly go wrong? Just about everything. I will point out, for the record, and for skeptics, that it is possible to make something new and wonderful out of something old and dusty -- look at the Bourne Trilogy. (Which I have seen about six times, each).But that is not what is happening here. Bereft of talent, we have a weak script that constantly stumbles over the material it is adapting, direction so lacklustre that even the action scenes appear to be in slow-motion, and a star who might just as well have phoned it in.Brosnan never, not once, connects with his character. At best, you have an ageing Bondish character who appears to have landed in the wrong movie. And, if the central character cannot find motivation ... how can the audience?",The November Man

35,tabuno,Perfected Espionage Film,9,16 January 2019,"27 August 2014. Bringing back the retro classic spy thriller, this taut, well-executed espionage movie retains the high razor-edged emotive tension of The Spy Who Came In From the Cold (1965), The Three Days of Condor (1975) or the more contemporary Page Eight (2011) or The Good Shepard (2006) without the overblown dependence on special effects, car chases, and over-extended fight sequences. Even with the excellent, well done spy movies such as Bourne Identity (2002), Salt (2010), The Assassin's Bullet (2011), this seriously portrayed espionage movie focuses instead on the raw brief gun battles, keeping the action simple and accomplished such as John Cusack in The Numbers Station (2013).Pierce Brosnan has ample experience in spy movies with his James Bond roles as well as The Matador (2002) and The Tailor of Panama (2001) and in this movie performs his character without smugness or flash. In some ways, his performance parallels that Daniel Craig in Casino Royale(2006) but in an even more believable role.The script is convoluted but intelligent with several groups attempted to stop Brosnan's character from fulfilling his mission. It has echoes of heart-pounding twisted high suspense found in Mission Impossible (1996), Enemy of the State (1998), Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (2011), and The Russia House (1990). The atmospheric tone and substantive air of The November Man are suggestive of Ryan Phillipe going up against Chris Cooper's character in Breach (2007), Robert Redford in Spy Game (2001),George Clooney in The American (2010).",The November Man

38,redryan64,Spaghetti Western or Spy Thriller?,6,21 September 2014,"SUDDENLY, THIS PAST weekend, we realized why we love TURNER CLASSIC MOVIES and old Film in general. We have always liked the Spy Genre of movie and enjoyed the work of one of its graduates, former REMINGTON STEELE and JAMES BOND, Pierce Brosnan.ALTHOUGH THIS WAS his baby, being both Star as well as Executive Producer, we can't give it a very high mark. It certainly wasn't for lack of budget, production values nor its Cast; which was excellent. Perhaps it is a case of trying too hard to please. ONE GREAT MAN( I believe it was Jesus) once said that ""You cannot be all things to all men."" Although this adage has been around in our lexicon for about two Millennia and has been proved to be true countless many times prior, its innate wisdom was reinforced in this film.BASING THE WHOLE story on the United States' being an evil, greedy and totally self-serving negative force in the World is the trite, overused premise at the core. The American governmental unit charged with keeping an eye on the World's trouble spots, the Central Intelligence Agency or C.I.A. for short, is portrayed as a sort of 'Shadow Government'; whose officers are hate mongering, cold blooded and power mad. (It's been done before, Schultz!) ITS MULTIPLE DOSES of heavy gun-play rival and even surpass those in a Sergio Leone directed film such as THE GOOD, THE BAD & THE UGLY or ONCE UPON TIME IN THE WEST; although the pacing and cleverly contrived situations leading up to the actual bloodshed portrayed are missing in this movie. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT complain about any lack of action, in there lies the rub. In much the same way as with INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM (1984), the various gun fights and chases have no pacing, little pauses and quickly became either a little nauseating or, even worse, predictable.ONE OTHER DEFECT that we happened to observe was that of not commission; but rather of omission. When the CIA guys are dispatched to perform their mission or when the 'other' bad guys are being either murderous or kidnapping someone, there are never any Civil Authorities around. These servants from a non-covert local government, are also often called THE POLICE! SHOOTINGS BY THE carload, hotels being robbed and some serious automobile accidents that are by-product of high speed chases through the Serbian Capital, all materialize without a trace of the Fuzz, the Big Heat, the Poe Lease! IF AND WHEN one goes to see this Post Bondian Period espionage thriller, one will doubtless be impressed with the great camera work in some very beautiful rural land and impressive urban scenes. The filming was done in Belgrade, Serbia (formerly capital of the now partitioned and extinct Yugoslavia). The rural scenery was provided by several sights in nearby Montenegro (also a part of the old Yugoslavia).THIS SCENERY APPEARS to have a sort of effect similar to the old travel loges in selling the public on visiting a locale. Perhaps the governments of this former communist land(s) had a hand in 'promoting' these locations to Mr. Brosnan and company.ONE WOULD PRESUME that this is a case of ""WE HATE YOU, YANKEE"", but please leave your $$$$$!!",The November Man

40,eddie_baggins,A cookie cutter action/thriller - wait for it to be on TV,4,22 June 2015,"You know your films missing the mark when you can't even draw out some charisma from a man that was once James Bond, as with The November Man we have a largely humorous, largely flavourless and totally generic spy thriller/actioner that struggles to difference itself from virtually all of its counterparts and with a story that tries to be many things, it ends up falling short on all aspects.The November Man gets muddled in a plot so convoluted you'd think you're watching a BBC miniseries not a 100 minute Saturday afternoon action flick and the film suffers for it. Taking oneself seriously is not by any means a crime but when scenarios and situations as silly as what happens in this film occur, it becomes an annoyance. We have such issues as Russian civil wars, child abductions, political power play, hidden families etc. etc. etc. It's all a little too much and action focused director Roger Donaldson struggles to maintain a cohesive/interesting narrative that his cast gets muddled up in.Lumbered with the thankless role of a retired CIA agent back from the joys of everyday life to wage war on the big baddies, Pierce Brosnan barley makes a mark as Devereaux. Devereaux comes across as merely an angry man who can shot a gun decently and plan meeting spots. Others in the film all equate to about the same sentiment with Olga Kurylenko playing the same role she did in films like Hit-man and Quantum of Solace and relative newcomer Luke Bracey gets the stereotypical young CIA agent role that sees him look concerned a lot. It would be right to say that with such a laboured set of characters the highlights in that sense here are the European set locations which are far more appealing than most of the narrative arc.The November Man is a film you've seen countless times before, it's not a horrible version of that story but it's also one that doesn't do enough to warrant any recommendation when its forefathers have set much higher benchmarks. A movie that will likely one day find an audience thanks to late night TV runs; this is one you can skip and catch up on in years to come when you find yourself on the couch and ready for some mindless action fixes.2 handily placed shovels out of 5",The November Man

Also some great plot twists, like a smart spy thriller should be.Pierce Brosnan is playing a former spy, although not James Bond, but I believe he is playing this character the way he wished he played James Bond. Although entertaining, it feels like another James Bond flick. Ogla Kurylenko who was in Quantum of Solace(2008), is good, but plays a sort of similar character from Quantum of Solace. Luke Bracey is good, but I feel I did not get much character out of him. But has it dragged towards the end the characters where becoming less interesting, where I was just waiting for it to be over, even though I found it smart and engaging, I would not consider it a great film, just an entertaining one, and not something I would want to sit through again.I'd could watch Taken(2008) a million times, then The November Man",The November Man

As a result, there is no differentiating the good guys from the bad, producing a story that is ludicrous and muddled. And when stagy acting is included in the mix, as is the case in this movie, the results are a tepid, predictable, cliché-ridden extravaganza. This movie has all the trappings of a major cinematic work - multiple settings, lots of noise, a major star, violence, profanity - typical for major productions today, yet they do not come close to making up for the movie's shortcomings: predictability, shallow characters, almost non-existent character development, all of which produces little, if any, dramatic impact. As for the premise of this story, that the US and Russia somehow conspired to provoke a war, that makes no sense whatsoever and stretches literary license to the limit, and if that premise does not make any sense, and it does not, then the entire story falls apart. Also, this movie continues the trend of demonizing Russians in ways that the Germans were demonized in the 1940s, except the Russians are neither Nazis nor enemies. So why demonize them? Pierce Brosnan gives a good performance as a spy with a conscience, but his presence cannot save this movie. Why portray the CIA and Russia as bad guys when there are already so many other parties throughout the world for whom such a label can be applied?",The November Man
44,stevendbeard,Good Bond-Lite,7,27 August 2014,"I saw ""The November Man"", starring Pierce Brosnan-He did 4 Bond movies from Goldeneye to Die Another Day, Remington Steele_tv; Luke Bracey- G.I.Joe:Retaliation, Home and Away_tv; Olga Kurylenko-Vampire Academy, Quantum of Solace; Bill Smitrovich-Ted, Iron Man and Will Patton-Falling Skies_tv, The Punisher_2004. This is a spy movie based on a book written by Bill Granger called 'There Are No Spies'. The altered title here, The November Man, is a nickname that was given to Pierce that means when he is finished with a job, there is not much left. Pierce plays a retired C.I.A. operative that gets drawn back into the business. Luke plays the young, eager agent that Pierce trained before he retired, which is shown in flashbacks. Bond... I mean Pierce, was the best of the best in his day and now has to go up against his former pupil, Luke. Olga plays someone that everyone wants to get a hold of, for one reason or another; it's mostly for the information she knows about a high level Russian diplomat that wants to be the next Russian President. Will and Bill are both running the C.I.A. now, with Will at the top and Bill as his next in command. Both of them were buddies with Pierce when Pierce was in his prime. The story was good and there were some good fight scenes- Remember, Pierce is in his 60's now-and of course, car chases. It's not as high tech as the Bond movies are but it is still a good action movie. The film is rated R so there is a little more nudity and violence than in the Bond pictures, too. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, drug use and sexual situations- including nudity and a rape scene-and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",The November Man
45,alindsay-al,An above average action film that does the job,6,1 September 2015,"I seem to watch allot of action films these days and allot of them are very similar and this includes the November man. The premise of the film sees an ex agent sent to rescue an agent until he gets mixed up in a conspiracy involving the CIA and the Russian government. Now u am a big fan of pierce brosnan even if he is in a bad film he is great and he totally owns thus film. He was an awesome action star but was also dark and tough and you see his character develop and he was a really interesting flawed action star. Luke bracey did a decent job as his former protégé and you really felt the conflict between the two of them and I did buy it. The former bond girl in this film who's name I cannot spell was also really good in this film. She was a really interesting character and she was a damaged character that was more then just an attractive girl to look at. The villains however, were just boring and cliché and didn't have anything of substance to them. The story is okay, I really liked the flashbacks and depth given to some of the characters. But, there are some pointless things in this film and the overall plot was pretty weak and boring. The script is not great, the dialogue is pretty poor but brosnan really makes it work and sometimes you forget about it. The style is a mixed bag, there are some pretty decent action scenes with some great sounding hits. However, they overuse slow motion allot and it doesn't help the action scenes at all. Overall the November man is enjoyable but it doesn't really consist on too many unique ideas.",The November Man
46,estebangonzalez10,As bad as the title suggests it is,3,17 November 2014,"""Know what we used to call you Peter? The November Man. Cause after you passed through, nothing lived.""Experiencing November Man felt like simply passing through and not feeling anything. I definitely didn't get any sense of enjoyment from Roger Donaldons's (Species, The Bank Job, The Recruit) latest film. The only thing it has going for it is getting to see Pierce Brosnan as a spy agent once again, although Peter Devereaux is a somewhat more serious character than James Bond was. It tries to portray him as a much darker character, but I didn't feel that way about him either. For a film that is trying to separate itself from the classic spy action thrillers it ends up relying on the same genre clichés and familiar plot twists. From the very opening scene of November Man I knew I wasn't going to enjoy this. I didn't like how these characters were introduced or how the action scenes took place. It was a completely dull experience for me.November Man was adapted from one of Bill Granger's spy novels centering on the anti-hero, Peter Devereaux. It is based on his 7th novel, ""There Are No Spies,"" which unfortunately I have never had the privilege of reading so I can't say how faithful this adaptation is. What I can base my review on however, is on how poorly written the characters are for this film. They try to portray Devereaux as a darker character, but at the same time they want to make us like him and understand him. I would say he is your typical spy who has been betrayed and is trying to discover the truth along the way. There is one scene where he cuts an innocent girl's femoral artery which felt out of place considering the film never tries to be a character study and focuses mostly on the action scenes. If the rest of the film focused on this gray side of his, I would have no problem in accepting it, but it mostly portrays him as a good spy who is trying to protect innocent lives. That scene sort of contradicts everything he has been portrayed as, especially in the opening scene. For a dark film they never go all the way to portray Brosnan as an anti-hero and they spend most of the time jumping from one familiar action scene to another. It simply doesn't stand out as neither an original serious spy thriller nor an entertaining light hearted one. Donaldson never figured out how to balance this film correctly and adapt it to the source material.November Man is an average spy thriller that relies heavily on Pierce Brosnan's charismatic performance. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't enough to save the familiar script or the poorly executed action scenes. The secondary characters were uninteresting and they failed to engage me, while the film relies on one too many familiar twists. Luke Bracey plays the young CIA agent who is being trained by Peter, but after a series of unfortunate events unfold that puts them face to face against each other. Bracey's character was poorly written and I didn't enjoy his performance either. The film centers on these two characters as they are forced to face each other, but Bracey's character is so uninteresting I did't really care for it. Olga Kurylenko is a beautiful actress, but her performance here kind of reminded me of some of her other bad films such as Max Payne or Hit-man. The sub-plot involving the Russian female assassin was laughable and pointless as the entire film was.",The November Man
47,Fluke_Skywalker,"Like its hero, its brutal and efficient",6,22 February 2015,"Coming on the heels of an old guy butt-kicker renaissance ('3 Days to Kill', any movie starring Liam Neeson), 'The November Man' manages to overcome a whole slew of genre clichés to surpass many of them. Though skillfully directed, much of the credit for its relative success has to go to its solid performances; particularly that of former Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, who is at his best here when he has to go to the dark side of his character.Made on a $15 million micro budget, 'The November Man' lacks the sort of large scale set-piece action sequences that typify this type of film, but that lack of bombast actually suits it.Doesn't exactly reinvent the wheel, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",The November Man
48,3xHCCH,Brosnan's Spy Comeback,5,15 September 2014,"Pierce Brosnan is one of those actors that have a distinct look and suave style that he cannot shake off in all of his work. Ever since he hit the big time as private investigator Remington Steele on TV in the 1980s, and up to the that time when he predictably became James Bond in the 1990s, he had been our favorite dapper, slick and charming action star.After a 12-year hiatus as Bond, Brosnan makes this comeback as a spy in ""November Man"". Like Bond, this is also based on an espionage book series by Bill Granger in the 1970s-1980s featuring the character Peter Devereaux. We are brought back to the era of the Cold War with CIA agents battling Russians. Peter Devereaux is called back from retirement by his former handler Hanley to extract a deep-penetration agent Natalia, who was secretly Peter's wife. However, a younger rival spy Mason, who was Peter's previous protégé, gets in the way of the mission and kills Natalia. Before her death, Natalia was able to give Peter a vital clue -- a name of a woman who carries the foul secret of the popular Russian presidential candidate Federov. As Devereaux, Pierce Brosnan still has it to credibly play a smart action hero. He injects new facets into this character though, a viciousness and hot-headedness that we have never seen from him before. He is not the epitome of cool in this one.The rest of the characters though are rather stock. Former Bond girl Olga Kurylenko uses her exotic beauty as an avenging war victim. Bill Smitrovich gets plenty of screen time as the double-dealing Hanley. Lazar Ristovski was at his sleaziest as Federov. The talents of Amila Terzimehic were wasted as the assassin Alexa.The worst detail though was about the supposed conflict between mentor and his student. The actor who plays Mason, Luke Bracey, may look like a Hemsworth brother, but does not have their screen charisma. The way the story was written did not really have a climactic face-off between these two characters that the trailer or press releases would have us believe. He could not hold a candle to Brosnan. In the ultimate analysis, the Mason character did not really matter in the aftermath of events.If only veteran director Roger Donaldson handled the whole mentor vs. protégé plot more properly, this could have been a solid and more memorable spy thriller, which may have the potential for a franchise. Pierce Brosnan definitely has it in him to be a leading man (not just one of the Expendables). Acquiring the film rights for this Devereaux book series was a good idea on Brosnan's part, but this first film could have been more spectacular than this to ensure a sequel.",The November Man
49,TdSmth5,Good story and the lovely Olga,8,18 September 2014,"Some CIA team is on some mission involving an ambassador in Eastern Europe. One of them is old-timer Devereaux, the other his trainee Mason who is involved with with a pretty waitress. D tells him to not get involved with anyone. Later D dresses up as the ambassador and walks in a crowded plaza. Mason is the sniper watching over the situation. When a gunman approaches D, Mason takes the shot in spite of D's orders to wait. A young boy becomes a collateral victim.Years later D is retired but is visited by his CIA friend Hanley. He needs him for an off-the-books mission that involves turning a Russian woman who works for the future president of Russia and has dirt on him--a name. As it turns out the woman is someone known to D. He accepts.The day of the mission, the woman takes some pictures of sensitive info on the Russian guy and leaves in a hurry. The guy discovers her and sends the FSB after her. Meanwhile the CIA is watching with a drone and following. When she runs into security forces D shows up and grabs her. But by then some sleazy Langley boss has decided to put an end to the operation. Mason, still in the CIA, takes the shot and kills the woman. Her last action is to share the info she has with D. D, who knows nothing of the official CIA operation, goes after their van and kills everyone until he sees Mason. They both have weapons drawn on each other, but neither shoots.What follows is a somewhat complex search for a girl. That's the name the woman gave to D. Looking for her is D, the CIA (Mason, Hanley, the boss), and a Russian Lara Croft working for the politician. It takes all three groups to a social worker, Alice, who was assigned the case of the girl. The girl was a witness during the Chechnya war of some crimes committed by the politician. But he did not act alone. As Hanley says, it's all about who gets to control the president of Russia. But since then the girl has vanished.The November Man is an interesting and strong international action thriller. It has a rich story that involves politics, history, spy craft, the relationship between the mentor and trainee, internal CIA politics. Along the way there are a couple of surprises. But it also tries to do more than it can. It's a bit too long and in the way it's edited, some aspects don't get enough attention. For example, the Lara Croft girl initially gets a lot of attention, then she vanishes for a good part of the movie only to appear as an after-thought near the end. There are some plot holes, which may or may not be editing issues. Direction though is very good. Brosnan as usual is cold and distant but likable. Bracey, Smitrovich, and Patton are solid. I'm glad Hollywood is finally letting some blonde males get some roles, but why do they all have to be Australian? They seriously can't find Americans? But the star of the movie isn't any of those, it's the lovely Olga Kurylenko who completely steals the show and that without playing the action hero and beating up on guys 3 times her size. The script turns surprisingly funny when Hanley is dealing with a female CIA agent. The November Man is a refreshingly mature action movie that isn't perfect but very entertaining.",The November Man
50,Amari-Sali,"What starts off as a generic Western Spies vs. the Russians movie, slightly evolves to include multiple betrayals and a few moderate twists.",7,13 September 2014,"When Pierce Brosnan was James Bond, I was far more worried about the latest episode of Digimon or Yu-Gi-Oh to take note of his role as the legendary character. So, years later, let's consider this me catching up on witnessing one of the few great action legends who has yet to be in The Expendables. But with The November Man featuring your usual Russian villains, an old spy coming out of retirement, and a rather predictable plot until maybe somewhere ¾ into the film, is it worth seeing?Characters & StoryAfter nearly 30 years of service within the CIA, Peter (Pierce Brosnan) decided to retire from the agency and dedicate his life to other pursuits outside of killing and espionage. Unfortunately though, after 5 years of being retired, his old handler Hanley (Bill Smitrovich) reactivates him for an old love interest, Natalia (Mediha Musliovic), who is also an agent, is in an increasingly dangerous position. For with her spying on an up and coming former Russian general, and popular presidential candidate, Arkady Fedorov (Lazar Ristovski), and getting incriminating information on him, she needs to be extracted.However, on the way to extraction Mason (Luke Bracey), Peter's former protégé, gets in the way. Thus leading to those two men having a constant back and forth due to Natalia, Fedorov, and ultimately Hanley.PraiseOutside of A Long Way Down, I am largely unfamiliar with Pierce Brosnan as an actor. I know of him from his work as James Bond, and remember him vaguely in Mamma Mia, but pretty much I saw him as a just one of the many Bond actors who hasn't done a lot of interesting movies since. Though with The November Man, I feel like I'm slowly becoming a fan. For with him having the British charm most of their imports have, and this slight edge and ferociousness when it came to some of his scenes with Bracey, I found myself a bit of ashamed for not knowing who this man is.As for the movie itself, what I liked about the film is, at first, it was hard to pin down who exactly was the hero or the villain. For you want to pin Mason as the villain for he does something to Peter, yet at the same time the way Peter goes out of his way to use this girl Sarah (Eliza Taylor) to teach Mason a lesson, it almost makes him out to be a villain. And between the back and forth of who maybe the villain, and then the injection of a Russian assassin, as well as the secrets of Fedorov which lead to many secrets revealed, you get an interesting story.CriticismThough, I should note, for most of the film it really does seem like every twist and turn they come up with you'll easily guess will happen long before it is seen on screen. This predictability takes away from the film a bit, especially since Brosnan's version of being a secret agent is rather shallow. For while he notes some sort of guilt or burden through remembering the people he killed, this isn't explored. Then, when it comes to the rest of the agents, Mason comes off as your generic soldier who does as he is told; Hanley is your veteran who may think ahead, but with his sexist mindset he seems a bit stuck in the past; and when it comes to our villains, they don't really stray too far at all from what you expect when you hear ""Russian Villains."" They aren't much for English, seem a bit nuts, have very cold personalities, and meet their end in such a way which makes any sort of credibility they might have had dissipate in a snap.Overall: TV ViewingThis is not a James Bond film, nor is this the type of film which may lead you to want to read the book the film is based on. The November Man is a film which shows Pierce Brosnan is still very capable of being an action star and can hold his own against younger talent. And this isn't to say this film seems made to stroke Brosnan's ego, but at the same time I don't think it really challenged him, the cast, or the expectations someone would have if they only saw the trailer. For, like many an action film, the main focus is the fighting, then the story. Of which, the story for ¾ of the film feels like a rehash of any generic western nation vs. the Russians film you have ever seen. Hence the TV Viewing label. For while Brosnan is entertaining, as are the majority of most of the actors, it just doesn't have the type of oomph which makes this worth seeing. If anything, it is something you watch on DVD with a few friends when there is nothing to do.",The November Man
51,robertemerald,Great performance from Pierce Brosnan,7,4 November 2019,"The November Man confirms Brosnan's credentials as a great action man. This is almost a Bond movie. It lacks the budget though, almost all of the action taking place in one city. It has a European look about it, but when I think back as to why this doesn't quite make it into the big league Bond or Bourne, I think it is because the locations chosen were a little ordinary in comparison, and whilst at times it attempts to dazzle with a little savvy use of tech, in truth it's nothing we haven't seen for years now. The November Man is a good auctioneer, and worth a look. The story makes sense, the script is good, there's plenty of surprises, and you won't see everything coming for most of the movie. And all the actors perform really well. Some of the characters were classically dastardly too. It's far less ruthless that Bond or Bourne, indeed, that's part of the theme. And I think the soundtrack let it down a bit too, it lacked draw and punch. I hope Pierce Brosnan does more movies like this, hopefully as a far darker character.",The November Man
52,Seraphion,"Very fast flow, with not so convincing action",6,8 September 2014,"After a botched mission and quitting the CIA five years ago, Peter Deveraux is asked by his ex handler Hanley to extract a former colleague Natalia, now a deep cover with the Russian president candidate Federov, who's hired an assassin who's been killing fellow agents. Peter goes to Moscow, rescuing Natalia just as the FSB start to hunt her. The CIA op team doesn't know who 's taking her, issuing a kill order on her. She's shot right after after giving out a name, Mira Filipova, to Peter. He spots the CIA drone and then intercepts the op team, killing all except David, his ex pupil from the mission five years ago. David gets debriefed by Perry, Hanley's boss, who tells him it's now a blood feud between the agency and Peter. Federov's assassin Alexa acquired info on Alice, a contact to Mira. Peter tricked the CIA techs for same info. Alice meets with a reporter Edgar and discuss Federov's war crimes. Alexa tricked Alice to go with her but Peter calls her cellphone stopping her. David and a CIA team storm the place, so Peter takes Alice with him. David goes out with his neighbor Sarah while Peter watches. At night Peter comes to David, taking Sarah hostage. After cutting Sarah's thigh artery, Peter escapes. Alice goes to Edgar to tell Mila's story, but Alexa kills him as Alice barely escapes. Checking back with Hanley, Peter discovers that Alice is Mira. David and the CIA discovers this also tight by the time Mira sneaked in to Federov's place. Peter comes, rescuing her from him. They interrogate him on the agent helping him on the war crimes. Federov tells Peter, as Mira confirmed, that it was Hanley. As the two head out, David gets into the scene. He and Peter eventually fight and ultimately Peter subdues him. Peter gives him Federov's recording. David knows things now but as he tries to rat on Hanley to Perry, there Hanley is on Perry's position. Hanley forces a trade; Mira for Lucy, Peter's daughter with Natalia, whom David found out about. David goes to rescue Lucy after he gets the location, disobeying Hanley. Peter has stashed Mira someplace and she writes an article on Federov's crimes on the internet café there, but Alexa had her hacker find out about her location. Luckily she can handle Alexa. David goes back to Hanley and Peter, killing off Hanley's guards. Peter then subdues Hanley's bodyguard. The article Mira wrote burns Federov's presidential candidacy but he's not implicated under anything. But we soon see his head receives a bullet at the last scene.The story moves and flows so very fast, something that is quite rare to see these recent times. The characters are only decently developed. The story contains so many twists and turns here and there. The attention to details All that are neatly put and crammed into a 100-minute length movie. Yet I find that the story is full of less needed scenes, like the whole thing with the character Sarah. Personally I think that it kind of stands alone and doesn't really add up to the bigger picture of the story.Althugh least likely, the twists presented are essentially predictable. They are so because of the obvious cast selection to play certain characters that seemed insignificant at first. The Alice/Mira thing is very much predictable since the second I see Olga Kurylenko on that role. But the Hanley twist is far more better to see as surprise, although it's quite strange to see that surprise on Perry getting sent home. The thriller gets just enough, serving enough suspense at scenes such as the early sniping scene, the Federov safe scene, and the hostage scene.The action is not really something awesome. It's just a rather there to help the movie claim the status of an action genre. There is no real thing offered by the action part. There is not much shootouts, fighting or explosion scenes worth mentioning as cool. Even worse, The director doesn't even bother to do any special effort, like slow motions or peculiar angles, to make the action look better. It's also quite strange to see that an older Pierce Brosnan can be a better shot, managing to kill all the lesser characters he shoots, way better than any James Bond role played.The acting is just a bit below okay for me as an overall. Pierce Brosnan acted out just a decent okay performance, although he seemed kind of flat in comparison to his recent drama or earlier Bond roles. Luke Bracey did good on the action moves, but he doesn't impress much on the close up and dialog scenes. Olga Kurylenko did good also on her part, although her facial expression is still very much flat.So my opinion for The November Man (2014) is a score of 6 out of 10. A recommendation is a so-so thing from me, considering that there are better movies on the cinemas than this one. But if you are an action addict, you'll be more than entertained to see the movies very fast story flow.",The November Man
53,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The November Man,7,31 August 2014,"Would you like a sterilized, stylistic R rated version of a Bourne movie? Or a condensed, exceedingly more violent version of a Bond flick? Or Taken? Or better yet, do you prefer your action sequences as the movie equivalency of red meat, right off the bone? Well, you'll surely dig 2014's The November Man. Truth be told, I had moderately low expectations going in to see it. After all, this rogue thriller hit theaters in late August where most films are part of your everyday, end- of-the-season scrap heap. Dare I say though that it ranks as the most profoundly surprising release of the summer.Shot by the guy who brought you 2003's The Recruit, showcasing an almost unrecognizable Will Patton (taking on a more serious role here as opposed to stuff like Armageddon and Gone in 60 Seconds), and featuring enough cell phone interplay to boost sales for Verizon Wireless, The November Man is based on a novel entitled There Are No Spies by Bill Granger. The proceedings begin with retired ex-CIA agent Peter Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan). He lives a quiet, stress free life until he is immediately brought out of retirement. His mission: to watch over a witness (Mila Filapova played by the stunning Olga Kurylenko) who was sexually assaulted and who's family was murdered during the Chechen War. Along with this current plight, Brosnan's Devereaux must also dodge his ex-CIA protégé (David Mason played by Luke Bracey) sent to hunt him down and prevent a despicable foreign president (Lazar Ristovski playing President Arkady Fedorov) from being elected again.Things to watch for if you decide to take in a viewing of ""November"": a scene where Pierce Brosnan's character knocks out two suspicious dudes and wraps them in cellophane with little straws to breathe through, a scene in which a fancy car is intentionally crashed (going 80+ miles an hour) giving new meaning to the term, ""don't forget to buckle up"", and a solid use of lush locales via the countries of Montenegro and SerbiaNow The November Man with its obvious intentions to avoid anything tongue-in-cheek, is willfully directed by Ronald Donaldson. He serves up plenty of gruesome, vilified action with blood that flows red aplenty. There are lots of gunfights, stabbings, and beatings that are meant to shock an audience. He stages violence as a virtuoso, a sort of symphony conductor who takes on multiple movements. There's a slickness, a hollowness, and an emptiness to what's on screen. Basically, everything feels like it's out of Luc Besson's playbook. But here's the thing: Donaldson does Besson better than Besson does Besson (and that's a good thing).In the arena of casting, it's obvious that Brosnan is a little too old and worn down to currently play 007. But that's okay because his performance here is similar yet better than anything he's ever done in a Bond film. Pierce must have had a chip on his shoulder after not getting asked to return to that long running film series. The result: he comes back with a vengeance. He's badder, nastier, colder, and more hard edged than he ever was as the famed super spy. In a nutshell, his Peter Devereaux (aka The November Man) could beat the snot out of Jimmy boy and then some. Even though Brosnan has always had strong physical gifts as an actor (he looks believable holding a gun, he uses his hands well which in turn is an effective tool for acting, and he has a pretty cool movie ""walk""), I always thought he was kinda wimpy in the role that he inhabited from 1995 to 2002. With The November Man, he's ticked off and overacts a bit, but he gets a chance to play a Bond type in a more gritty, more adult-themed setting. His days playing the suave British Secret Service agent may be over but being James Bond is like being president anyway. Sooner or later, you have to hand the baton over after one or two terms.All and all, throughout its relatively short running time of an hour and 48 minutes, The November Man is humorless, witless, and devoid of any true human compassion. Frankly, it doesn't have time for these sort of shenanigans. This action thriller is all about business. Initially while viewing it, I wanted to rename it ""November Rain"" (no pun intended on the 1992 Guns N' Roses ditty). The plot at times, seems all wet. There were way too many characters, too many jumbled story lines, and you couldn't differentiate the good guys from the bad guys. Thankfully, director Roger Donaldson masks this notion by keeping the viewer intrigued and interested anyway. This vehicle is extremely fast paced with lightning quick editing. Once things reach their heightened, staggering conclusion (with a twist I didn't see coming), all the plot puzzle pieces seem to come together just fine. As for its grizzled up, weathered star, all I gotta say is welcome back Pierce Brosnan. You're better off in this world than in the Bond world any day.",The November Man

Devereaux needs to know who that woman is (Olga Kuryienko as Alice) so she can be protected to insure Federov doesn't become the Russian President. Devereaux is pitted against Mason (Luke Bracey) who he had trained and now Mason is ordered to take Devereaux out. Seems the CIA doesn't appreciate Devereaux's involvement. Oh, oh.This is a well told and well paced movie with many twists and turns. Brosnan will remind you of characters: Jason Bourne, James Bond, and a Liam Neeson character when he protects his family with his ""skills."" So it's all good and we hope Brosnan continues in this arena. I would nominate Brosnan for an Oscar and the Academy needs to recognize that many of these Action Hero characters are very good actors who provide a wealth of entertainment. No CGI was in evidence, but there are some excellent car chasing and fight scene stunts. A great supporting cast help make this a must see terrific spy movie.

56,moviexclusive,"The plotting does stumble towards the end, but this old-school spy thriller has enough twists, action and most importantly, an ace in former 007 star Pierce Brosnan",7,28 August 2014,"It's not hard to see why Pierce Brosnan had, for a couple of years, tried to get this film made; despite being a perfectly capable dramatic actor, it is his time as James Bond that people remember most fondly about the 61-year-old Irish actor, so it is no wonder that Brosnan would want at some point to get back into the spy game. There is pedigree and potential here too - the character is the protagonist of novelist Bill Granger's 1980s Peter Devereaux series, and if this movie adapted from the seventh book of that series hits paydirt, there are always many other books on which a franchise could be built.Thankfully for Brosnan, who also produces the movie through his Irish Dreamtime company, 'November Man' is a sturdy enough thriller that could be the start of several such mid-budget European-set sequels to come. Gone are the gadgets, the girls and the quips that were a centrepiece of Brosnan's 007 days though - Brosnan's Devereaux is the kind of gritty spy Daniel Craig fashioned the 007 character after Brosnan departed, a no-nonsense CIA man at the top of his game who retired after a mission gone wrong with his protégé, David Mason (Australian actor Luke Bracey).Devereaux is pulled back into the field when his former handler from Langley, a hawk-eyed Hanley (Bill Smitrovich), asks for his help to pull an asset out of Moscow. The woman has critical information about the future head of the Soviet Union, Arkady Federov (Lazar Ristovski), which the CIA would like its hands on, but Devereaux accepts only because she is also his former colleague and lover. That simple mission goes unexpectedly awry when Devereaux finds himself pitted against Mason, whose orders were not only to 'take out' the woman but also Devereaux himself. What's more, Hanley is simultaneously taken into custody by his own CIA unit, after it turns out that he had recruited Devereaux behind their backs.As scripted by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek, the film combines a couple of familiar tropes. Here we have a teacher and his best protégé turned enemies, so that we get to see just how much of the former's skills the latter has honed into his own. We also get a spy versus the Agency, with Devereaux seemingly gone rogue against the apparently corrupted CIA establishment. And finally, we get a witness everyone is after, who as Hollywood convention dictates, happens also to look like a supermodel - that would be Alice Fournier (played by former Bond girl Olga Kurylenko) - and is protected by none other than Devereaux himself.So far, so good - for the first hour, Roger Donaldson directs a relatively taut and tense setup that keeps you hooked at trying to figure out just who is playing who. We know Devereaux is the good guy here, but just who is everyone else? Will Mason become a cold-hearted killing machine to take out his former trainer? Is Mason's boss the one pulling the strings? What does he have to do with an operation involving Federov and a building which fell in Chechnya that precipitated the war between the two countries? And just who is this Mira whom everyone is looking for, who apparently has Federov's dirty secrets from his past as a Russian general in the Chechen war?But after a promising start, what was a tightly plotted affair starts to go off the rails. There are a lot of revelations here, and to be fair, a somewhat twisty knot of events to unravel the truth behind the smokescreens. Yet, the scripting gets weaker by the minute - in particular, a thoroughly extraneous scene where Devereaux confronts Mason in his own apartment and decides to teach the latter a thing or two about developing affections for the opposite sex by slashing the femoral artery of his next-door neighbour/ girlfriend for no other apparent reason - and the leaps of logic get more far-fetched as Donaldson tries his darnest to keep the proceedings moving at a brisk clip until the climax.Never a less than competent helmer, Donaldson largely succeeds, inserting some efficiently thrilling car chases, shootouts and hand-to- hand combats in between the betrayals, admissions and ultimatums. It certainly helps that Brosnan is just as sure a hand at playing a spy, slipping effortlessly into the role with charisma and lending this screen incarnation of Devereaux a dignity and poise that very few silver-haired action stars can do. Brosnan's co-stars are however forgettable, though Kurylenko proves to be a sight to behold in her own right when she puts on a short sexy dress to seduce Federov in his own hotel room.To be sure, 'November Man' never quite comes close to the heights of Bourne, which is in a league of its own. But for less demanding audiences looking for some late-summer action, this entirely B-grade Euro-set thriller will do the trick. It's got espionage, suspense, blood, some sex (clearly trimmed here for an NC16 rating though), and most of all, Brosnan; yes, the latter is singlehandedly the best thing the film has going for it. And in turn, Brosnan gets his wish - an opportunity back into the spy game, and a pretty good one at that too.",The November Man
57,Luigi Di Pilla,Nothing new but still entertaining,6,6 December 2015,"It met slightly my expectations.The pace was good and there was enough suspense to keep my attention high. The story was not complicated and the performance of ex-James Bond Pierce Brosnan was fresh and respectable.The filming locations with Lausanne, Montenegro or Moscow gave this spy thriller a serious touch. In other words, if you have nothing special to do one evening this one is the perfect entertaining action movie. But it's not worth to see it again or hold it for example in my best of DVD collection.See therefore the trilogy of Taken or the Bourne series.Solid 6/10.",The November Man

59,inspectors71,"Human or ""Taker of Human Life""",6,24 March 2016,"I've seen this movie before. To be more accurate, I've seen lots of spy stories, and The November Man is nothing original, but the pacing and the plot twists make for a dandy couple hours of thrills and spills.The viewer, so often the victim of clichéd crap in the theater or on TV, can rest assured that Roger Donaldson, who has made everything from The Bounty to the awful remake of Peckinpah's The Getaway, from gory science fiction (Species) to historical fiction (Thirteen Days), will deliver a journeyman effort.Even if there are no major push-backs against the Hollywood cliché machine.There is a moment in the movie that Pierce Brosnan's character warns his protégé that he can either be ""a human or a taker of human life,"" he can't be both. This is the sort of extra sprinkle of intelligence that makes The November Man a cut above. And the cut that happens right after that comment is enough to make the viewer gasp with horror.I watched The November Man last night, and I found myself not wanting to do chores (easy ones at that) because I wanted to immerse myself in the story.For the life of me, I can't think of a better recommendation than that. The next time USA Network shows it, sit down, put the dishes and the laundry off for awhile, and enjoy a good, solid spy story.And don't pay for it! I didn't see TNM uncut, but I don't think I missed anything critical from the edited-for-television version.",The November Man
60,brchthethird,Rather entertaining and surprisingly watchable despite not making much sense,5,23 January 2015,"""The November Man"" finds Pierce Brosnan returning to the kind of role he did as James Bond, except this time the results are a bit more mixed. It certainly delivers as pure action, but the script is all over the place. For one, the trailers were kind of misleading. It sets up the film as this ""teacher vs. student"" thing when the actual plot is a lot more messy and convoluted. It's also stuffed with tropes and clichés that we've seen dozens of times before in spy action movies such as this one. Without spoiling anything it goes without saying that there are plenty of twists and turns, but none that you won't see well before they are actually revealed. There's also the mainstay of the CIA (much like its real-world counterpart) meddling in international affairs. It's all very entertaining on a surface level and as escapist fantasy, but it all falls apart when put under some scrutiny. The bottom line is that, despite being very watchable, it makes very little sense. That being said, Brosnan hasn't been this good in a while and for most action fans wanting to see him kick some butt, this movie will do just fine. Just don't go in expecting GoldenEye.",The November Man
61,khanbaliq2,A dull and forgettable spy flick.,6,30 October 2014,"Yeah, Pierce Brosnan is 61 now but he's still a fine leading man in movies. I usually enjoy watching Brosnan in films, and my mother thinks that he's the most attractive actor out of the ones who've played James Bond. Can't say I agree with the man's politics though. Brosnan is really the only reason to see The November Man because the film is not memorable or entertaining. It's no wonder that Brosnan's photo takes up most of the film's poster. It's an above average spy action thriller that gets a few things right but it's nowhere near as engaging as, let's say, GoldenEye (1995), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) or The World Is Not Enough (1999). In addition to Brosnan, the film has good-looking actress a) Olga Kurylenko and good-looking actress b) Eliza Taylor, as well as some well-photographed international locations. Other than that though there's really nothing else to like in The November Man. The biggest problem is the screenplay, written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek. It makes the film confusing, it contains terrible dialogue, and the characters are not interesting. Sure, as producer, Brosnan got the right ingredients for a good spy movie, including director Roger Donaldson. But because of the poor screenplay the result is disappointing. By the way, Donaldson directed No Way Out (1987), White Sands (1992) and The Getaway (1994), films that you should really see. The November Man, on the other hand, is definitely something that you can avoid. What one should know about Donaldson as director is that he's usually at the mercy of the screenplay. This is obvious in The November Man, which is confusing and at times offensive. Even if it didn't contain those anti-Russian bits, The November Man still wouldn't have worked because at one moment it shows women as victims, at another moment it shows women as ruthless killers, and at another moment it shows women as seducers. It just doesn't make sense. I don't recommend The November Man.",The November Man
62,bjarias,.. Hollywood's motto too many times.. style over substance,6,1 October 2014,"There's really not a lot going for this movie.. it's a mostly tame storyline and the characters are nothing to get all too excited about. And it's only in the world of make believe, or a world with lots and lots of money, would a sixty year old Brosnan get a thirty-three year old and very hot Kurylenko to pay any attention to him. It's a shot taking a chance on these kinds of films, sometimes it works out.. regrettably more times than not, the audience comes away disappointed. The two leads are nice to look at, but that's the extent of it. In Hollywood it's the face on the screen making all the big bucks.. but in reality, folks putting words on paper are also a crucial element of what makes for an interesting and worthwhile film experience.",The November Man
63,carbuff,Best Pierce Brosnan 007 that never was.,8,3 May 2015,"Very slick, quite harsh and brutal in parts, and sustains suspense throughout; however, still essentially nearly totally predictable as it is built around a plot and stereotypical characters that have been done a thousand times before. From a political point-of-view, it wouldn't be unreasonable at all to consider this movie well-polished anti-Russian propaganda, although I'm not super bothered by this, since I'm not a big fan of mother Russian right now anyhow. Pushes all of the right emotional buttons appropriate to a male fantasy of supreme macho competence. Pierce Brosnan plays a better and more realistic 007 than he ever did in any actual Bond film, insofar as you can use the term realistic with a film like this. He seems to have aged well into this kind of role. Now maybe we should dump the dour and pretentious Craig and return to Brosnan as an older, but better and wiser agent On Her Majesty's Secret Service (just an idea folks). For what this film intends to be, I think it succeeds very well, so I' rating it pretty highly, although ultimately there is nothing here to really make you think. If you're looking for a pretty relentless but not utterly ridiculous action movie, you might want to give this a shot.",The November Man

68,DareDevilKid,It's a Thrill Seeing Brosnan in an Action Movie Once Again,7,6 September 2014,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.2/5 starsWhen a former James Bond actor plays a suave, globe trotting spy in another film, that's always going to be the main headline. Such is the case with ""The November Man"", which sees Pierce Brosnan suiting up and strapping on a gun in a game of international intrigue as Peter Devereaux, an ex-CIA agent who is brought out of retirement for one more mission. The plot itself is pretty standard stuff, but it's great watching Brosnan in action once again.Brosnan's final appearance as Bond was in 2002's ""Die Another Day"", but he wasn't officially removed from the role until 2004. Almost immediately afterward, Brosnan's production company, Irish Dreamtime, obtained the rights to Bill Granger's book series, ""The November Man"" – from which the seventh novel, ""There Are No Spies"", is the source material for this movie - with the intention of having Brosnan play the lead role. However, it would take 7 years before production would begin.The plot centers around Brosnan as Devereaux, who's living a cozy retired life in Switzerland. When Hanley, his old CIA handler asks him to go on one last mission, to pull a female agent out of Russia, Devereaux agrees for personal reasons. During the mission, Devereaux's target is killed by another agent, who turns out to be Mason, a former protégé of Devereaux's. Before the woman is killed however, she provides Devereaux with the name of a woman who holds important information regarding the future president of Russia. It seems that some people on the American side are just as anxious to keep this information quiet as the Russians are, and so it becomes a race between Devereaux, Mason, and the Russians to see who will get to the woman first.Even at 61 years of age, Brosnan still has what it takes to play the action hero. The script helps by having him play at least close to his own age and by keeping the action believable. There are no Bond- sized stunts here. Devereaux also has a bit more edge than Bond. He kills indiscriminately, just as everyone else seems to in this movie, and without compunction. If you're in his way, you're probably going to get shot, no matter which side you're on. However, the down side of all this killing is that all these deaths have no effect on anyone, nor do they have any consequences. We learn only a little of Devereaux's past, but because he is played by Brosnan, we don't need to. This is a case of the actor's charisma filling in for the character's.Sadly, apart from Brosnan, the film offers little. Luke Bracey as Mason, is handsome, but dull. Beyond craving Devereaux's approval, he has almost no personality or charisma. Olga Kurylenko - who has her own Bond back-story from when she appeared in ""Quantam of Solace"" - looks mesmerizing on screen and her character has potential, but she is reduced to a damsel in distress, dragged around in Devereaux's wake. It was pleasing though that the script avoided any romance – barring an allusive undercurrent before the climax - between Devereaux and her character. Apart from the age difference, it would have slowed down the plot.The only other female character in the story is Amila Terzimehic as Alexa, a Russian assassin. She seems intriguing when she's introduced, but then almost nothing is done with her character throughout the entire film. Her opening scene sets the audience up to think, ""Ah ha, now here's a deadly killer"", but then it's as if the writers didn't know what to do with her. I'd rather have seen Devereaux go toe-to- toe with her than the terminally boring Mason.There are a few twists and turns in the story, but too many of them are predictable. This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. How many Bond films ever truly surprise you, for instance? But the rest of the film would have to be more entertaining to make up for the lack of surprises, like most Bond films or even other good spy-action films such as the ""Mission Impossible"" series end up being. That's not to say ""The November Man"" isn't entertaining; it's far from a bad film and has many exciting scenes and good twists going for it, but some of the action scenes could have been better planned and executed. Also, more than a permissible number of filler sequences end up unnecessarily derailing the film.Before the film opened, Brosnan spoke of a sequel being in the works. There's enough potential in the character to warrant one, but it's going to need a much stronger script than this one if Brosnan wants to make it an ongoing series.",The November Man
69,RevRonster,Good action but way too by-the-numbers...,4,12 December 2014,"The trailer really didn't do much for me when this one was on its way to the theaters other than having me say, ""Wow, this looks generic but it seems like the action could be alright."" Oddly enough, that's exactly what I found when I watched the film.My prediction about the action was dead-on because the fight and chase scenes in this film are definitely satisfying and entertaining. Additionally, all the acting from the cast is very strong and Pierce Brosnan was very entertaining as the non-Bond spy Peter Devereaux. In reality, this film could have easily been a predictable but mildly and average spy thriller with some great action. However, instead, the film just comes off as forgettable thanks to a story that feels like it is meandering around in a sea of spy thriller clichés and has no real focused point it is trying to reach. It ultimately made the film kinda boring and very hard to really get into.",The November Man

Pierce Brosnan does not look aged at all as he brings the action to this film. I always defend the old guys in Expendables stating I hope to look half as good as they do at their age, but Pierce prove to be far more impressive as a believable old timer CIA agent, who still got what it takes to effectively play the spy game. The espionage story is not complex, but there are a lot of elements to it that make for interesting twist & turns. Plus the filmmakers did a good job of blending all the main characters stories together to make a movie you never get lost in. Except when it comes to the brilliant action sequences which you get lost in in the best way possible.

My only issue was it seemed that I kept losing track of what was going on with the plot here and there, but then a little later, would pick up on it again.

Don't trust anyone is a lesson learned in the movie. Besides, the balance of the world may depend on it.

75,lathe-of-heaven,"A high quality, well made Espionage / Thriller. Very suspenseful, involving, and entertaining... Rewatchability: Very High Blu-ray: Excellent A:10 V: 10",8,23 August 2015,"BRIEF BLU-RAY REVIEW:Wow, this baby looks positively amazing! VERY sharp, textured, and with deep, saturated colours. In the commentary, the director mentions that they did use digital cameras but with anamorphic lenses which I guess lends a sharp but textured look to the picture. I have hundreds of Blu-rays and this one REALLY impressed me with how absolutely beautiful it looked. From the exquisite shots of the city, the buildings, and the streets, to the close-ups of faces and interiors. Truly lovely...I am somewhat puzzled at the negative reviews that exist for this film. Yes, MOST are quite positive, but even at Bluray.com, which I ALWAYS check for their reviews, the guy there was kind of snarky about this movie, saying that Pierce's character was somehow 'Schizophrenic' in some way as far as his 'Good' / 'Bad' behaviour, but I truly did not see that at all... I thought his actions were well within the parameters and consistent with how his character was laid out, and not forced or over the top, which is very easy to do when you are going for a darker, grittier mood. I found this movie to be extremely well done, very tightly paced, well acted, and nicely put together all the way around. After reading the dubious review about the movie itself at Bluray.com, I kept expecting some of the elements to be poorly done, or that maybe some of the acting would not be so hot, but ultimately I personally found this film to be one of the VERY best Thrillers that Brosnan has been in since his James Bond days.The writing was excellent. The story was very believable and involving. Not only did it have a good Espionage / Thriller aspect to it, which is primarily what I was interested in, but it also handled the element involving the mentor agent and his protégé throughout the story in a way that worked really well. I also felt that the supporting actors, especially Bill Smitrovich, did an outstanding job. I guess if I absolutely HAD to complain about something and someone was actually threatening me with SEVERE bodily harm unless I came up with something negative, I suppose, and this I must emphasize is just my own personal taste or preference and not necessarily a general detraction from the quality of the film itself, I would just mention that for me personally, I could have done without the protracted sex scene or perhaps the explicit nature of some of the violence here and there. But again, that is just my own taste in the sense that I basically feel that the quality of the film was so good itself that it just simply was not really NEEDED to add in those few, brief elements. They had the feeling, to me at least, of almost being 'tacked on' or thrown in just because.... No real biggie; just my preference... However, I DID like the overall 'Dark' elements that made both the story and the characters very visceral, textured, and 'Real', but I didn't think that they went overboard or overdid it like many times they do when they are deliberately going for a 'Gritty' and 'Realistic' feel.So all in all, I genuinely felt that this was one of the better made Thrillers that I have seen in quite a while. I would say that if you really like a good Espionage / Thriller like I do, then there is a very good chance that you will enjoy this excellent, entertaining movie...I gave it a very solid '8' which I think it fully deserves...",The November Man
76,trpdean,Very fine - complex but not too much so - great performance by Brosnan,8,10 June 2018,"The first thought is ""Another James Bond?"" In physicality, yes, certainly. Brosnan is in amazing shape - and just as active, energetic, ferocious as in any Bond. In terms of special effects, no this is a more serious and grounded movie than any Bond. Unlike the James Bond films, this deals with quite serious real-world issues - loosely based on headlines from Bosnia-Hercegovina and Russia in recent decades. The movie is deeply suspenseful, fast-paced, complicated (but you can follow), very well- acted - but most of all it's a superb Piece Brosnan as a truly world-weary, cynical, older, former secret agent - pulled back into the game. - and vicious antagonists.

I am shocked and appalled that no one was willing to release this to theatres so it had to be released direct to DVD because this was surprisingly good.

78,monstermayhem32,decent movie but confusing at certain points,7,30 August 2014,"I will admit that it was nice to see Pierce Brosnan return to the action genre after playing 007 in four James Bond films. It feels as thought he was meant to play one of the older action stars in a way that seems to be rather popular for Liam Neeson. The character of peter Deveraux and his prodigy are attempting to uncover a conspiracy that could mean certain doom. Even though it seems as though Peter and David seem like they are in opposite sides, but it seems as though their common goal is to find out who is the one behind it. I did wish that the film would have had a more clear narrative since certain parts were confusing especially the Peter and David relationship which should have been developed a bit more. Olya Kurylenko plays Mira who has a dark secret of her own and planning revenge against someone who murdered her family. The film does show the price of what being a killer does to one's own sanity which is done well. However I do hope the sequel has a more clear storyline.",The November Man
79,trublu215,Surprisingly dull and tough to get through,4,27 August 2014,"November Man seemed as if it was going to be an awesome throwback to the Pierce Brosnan days of Bond, his Never Say Never Again almost. Unfortunately, it doesn't amount to anything but an incoherent mess of a film. The storyline is very typical, almost so typical that you keep wondering if you missed something or it is merely just that brainless and redundant? The answer is yes, The November Man is a film that takes what could have been a grand throwback to the espionage thrillers of yester-year and turns it into a brainless big budget fan film hybrid cross between John Woo and a 90s James Bond. The director, Roger Donaldson feels sluggish here. It feels as if he knew the film was bad and tried everything to get it to work but it, unfortunately never comes to flotation. The editing is sloppy, the action sequence get considerably ridiculous especially with its use of slow motion, which adds another corny and campy vibe to an already far-fetched story that takes itself way too seriously. Despite these faults, The November Man does showcase a very good performance from Pierce Brosnan. While the story does lack an intellectual plot to make this intriguing enough, Pierce Brosnan carries the film on his shoulders and moves full speed ahead even when the film doesn't seem to be going much of anywhere. As far as an action film is concerned, the shootouts are somewhat decent in certain scenes but become increasingly annoying as they all start to blend together and feel boring. The violence in this film is actually something that did take me by surprise considering how brutal some of the scenes are. However, while some of the violence is shocking at first, Roger Donaldson decides to capitalize on the gore by throwing slow motion blood, bullets and brains to the mix for the final shootout, absolutely killing any shot of redemption for the film at that point. It may look cool but it contributes nothing at all except something for gore hounds to marvel at, maybe. Overall, The November Man features vintage Pierce Brosnan echoing back to Live Wire and Goldeneye but the film suffers from a narrative stand point and tries to cover up its lacking story with graphic violence and loud music.",The November Man

Now, jump to 2021, and I decided it was time to give ""The November Man"" another watch. Does it hold up to my happy memories, or is it a worse film than I wanted to originally admit?""The November Man,"" starring Pierce Brosnan and Luke Bracey, is a lot of things - but the first word that comes to mind is ""entertaining."" Not once did I find myself bored while watching this film; that's not to say the movie doesn't have its flaws. But let's start with the good: Pierce is flat-out great in this movie. And that's not surprising, as he's played the role of a badass secret agent before. However, in this movie, Brosnan has some grit to him, at points getting darker than you might expect, which adds some layers to his character that are enjoyable to watch. Olga Kurylenko is also good in this movie, and as gorgeous as ever. She has some vulnerable moments that can be interesting to watch, and she shares a large amount of screen time with Brosnan, and together they chew up the scenery. They have good chemistry, and it helps that the both of them are top notch actors.Action-wise, there are some fun sequences in the movie. A lot of the action seems to lack impact, and that may be because of the use of noticeably fake blood (occasionally, when someone gets shot, blood squirts 15 feet into the air, and it kind of broke my immersion). However, there are enough cat-and-mouse chase scenes, slick getaways, explosions, and Brosnan-induced headshots to hold your interest throughout the film.We talked pros, now let's talk cons. Besides Brosnan and Kurylenko, every other actor in this movie is, well, not good. Overacting, underacting, you name it, ""The November Man"" has it - Luke Bracey was perhaps the worst offender. Nothing against Luke Bracey, but he was terribly wooden in this movie, never conveying enough emotion when needed, and spewing ""badass"" lines on a constant basis that probably sounded better on paper than they did through someone's mouth. The dialogue in this movie is so cringey, akin to something out of the Bourne movies, without the acting chops to make them passable. There were times I found myself wincing because of how bad the script was - and speaking of the script, narrative cohesion is another problem ""The November Man"" displays.Like I said earlier, you get a darker, grittier Pierce in this movie - at times. You see, ""The November Man"" is filmed with a very convoluted plot, packing in so many plot points that by the time they show Brosnan's character as a potential anti-hero, the thread is introduced and resolved within five minutes. And when I say, ""resolved,"" I mean that this particular story-arc happened, and was never brought up ever again. Instead, the movie pivots course, focusing on governmental betrayal, the East versus the West, political power struggles, and more, all on top of a young spy going up against his mentor. I mean seriously, the ""Spy versus Spy"" theme the trailer advertises is just a quarter of this movie's story - why wasn't it the entire film? There is so much different stuff packed into this movie that every plot is basically gasping for breath, as none of them get adequate breathing room. I don't know about you, but a tight, taut thriller about a hardened, older ex-secret agent who's forced to fight his mentee sounds like a damn exciting film in its own right - I only wish ""The November Man"" agreed.This film is carried by the performances of Brosnan and Kurylenko, and is glued together with genuinely fun to watch action scenes. However, the generic, overly-convoluted plat proves to be a major hindrance to the overall quality of the film. That said, I never found myself bored or actively disliking my viewing experience, which is why I conclude that ""The November Man"" is a perfectly watchable and entertaining film, if a disappointing one as well.",The November Man

84,gabriel_sanchez,Nice action flick; not great by any chances.,7,8 August 2015,"There's not that much to say about this movie; it's pretty straight forward.The acting was fine, nothing great by any chances.Plot was OK too, though I think it got kinda convoluted at the end. I mean, at some point, it feels that our main character has no real motivation, no real quest indeed.It first looks like the plot is all about revenge, but at the end, it seems that is all about what's going on at the present moment, there's no real motivation behind his actions. I can bear that...It's a legit action flick: good guy is a badass, ""bad"" guy is a badass too... they both are way too good to be humans, haha.I think it lacked some backstory, it seemed that all was given to the viewer way too quickly, but I think that's a mark of a regular action movie: it's all about the main dude being good at what he does. I was amused throughout the movie and never felt bored at any time. I think it's a fine movie to watch, overall, but it's not great by any means. One should watch it just as an entertainment on a Sunday afternoon.",The November Man
85,backnblack-06123,SERIOUSLY THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE,9,20 June 2020,"No ideal why the low ratings other than people are clueless, this was a really good to watch, even pace great acting and believable, much better than the James Bond movies of the last ten years.
Brosnan show he's one of the best male actors of all time",The November Man
86,krzysiektom,An embarrassment for everybody involved,2,28 October 2014,"Very, very poor, to the point of rolling your eyes. Low production values, clearly a low budget, poor action scenes, a risible, almost idiotic script, poor dialog writing and mediocre acting. I give it 2 and not 1 thanks to some shots of Olga's lovely legs and a decent overview of Belgrade. If you expect the standards of the Bourne trilogy or the better Bond films, do not waste even 2 USD on rental, better wait till it's free on TV. Brosnan should be ashamed of himself, especially as a former 007. As for Olga, she is lovely as usual, though in my view she might gain a few kilograms. Too thin, girl, eat something!",The November Man
87,abouhelier-r,The November Man,7,1 November 2014,"An ex-CIA operative is brought in on a very personal mission and finds himself pitted against his former pupil in a deadly game involving high level CIA officials and the Russian president-elect. The November Man is directed by Roger Donaldson and stars Pierce Brosnan as its title character. Roger Donaldson also directed The Bank Job (2008) which is one of Jason Statham' best movie. Let me tell you how excited I was when I heard that Pierce Brosnan was returning as a spy; A little bit nostalgic. This film is full of classic spy cliché such as, for instance, people walking away slow motion explosions and it doesn't seem to get started until half way through. However towards the third act the movie really showed itself and I was like: ""Why didn't they do that from the beginning?"" Unfortunately, the fact is that it's so terribly cliché since the beginning that when you see where things are going and certain puzzle pieces start to make sense, you are already checked out of the movie. Yet, Pierce Brosnan is great; he could play this role eyes closed. Olga Kurylenko is good as well, you grow some sympathy for her character and the movie takes on a completely different meaning when you realised certain things about her. Plus, I have to point out that women are over objectify and her character is only introduced when it's convenient for the man to have a bargaining girl which isn't as cool as it sounds. Brosnan's protegee starring Luke Bracey is pretty cool as well and I think this guy's got a future. This movie reminds me of two other movies released this years: 3 Days to Kill and Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. Overall I think The November Man could have been a lot better thanks to a stronger writing and directing; it's good to see Pierce Brosnan back into the spy game.",The November Man
88,michaelhirakida,A Rarity that Comes once in a while.,8,2 September 2014,"Once in a while, there comes a movie that is so ridden with clichés and plot contrivances, I have no choice but to enjoy it. The November Man is one of those movies that is so wonderfully filled with Clichés,Contrivances, Laughable Acting and Unintentionally Hilarious Scenes that it is lots of fun to watch.The Plot follows Peter, An Agent out of retirement on a mission to protect *Spoilers* his wife from Russians! She dies and now starts a battle between him and David Mason who he *Spoilers* dropped him out of the agency. Now he must protect Alice who is targeted by the Russians. Or something like that.This Movie is so wonderful. I Love Pierce Brosnan as an action star and I love him in this role to. It is so fun to watch him in such scenes as when He holds David's Kind of Sort of not really Maybe girlfriend hostage. I don't know why, but I started laughing really hard because the acting was so unintentionally funny. Its one of the shining moments in this movie that shows how fun a cliché ridden action movie can be.I mean it. There are so many Clichés. There is such clichés such as the ""Killed The Wrong Guy"" and the ""Car Exploding"" and my favorite of all, the ""Russian Roulette"" where he pulls out a magnum interrogating the going to be Russian President and has one bullet in the Magnum's chamber and keeps pulling the trigger to see if he will answer his questions. But even though it is enjoyable, there is still its flaws. Characters seem to disappear into a black hole such as David's kind of not really maybe girlfriend who is sent to hospital and never seen again. The guy who owns the strip club disappears also after Alice asks him to do a favor. Where did they all disappear to?! Who knows. But the ending. My God the ending had me laughing. The upcoming Russian President looks like he got away. But then... HE IS SHOT IN THE HEAD! BOOM! End credits. I was like ""That's one way to end a movie."" and is one of the reasons worth the admission price. The November Man is such a fun movie and shows Pierce Brosnan has still got it for now. Fun action scenes, Unintentionally funny scenes and setting makes this a must have in your collection when this comes out on Blu Ray/DVD. I say support this movie because it is not doing that well at the box office and even The New Sin City is beating it. Help make the movie a success and make it reach its 15 million mark! 82/100 B",The November Man
89,rprince-832-6294,All so generic....,6,7 November 2014,"-The November Man is a generic spy-ish movie and I'm not really sure what it's about. Like if you asked me I could not tell you. So this should be an interesting review....-The story, well I really had trouble following it. It's story and tone was incredible unfocused, as not even for the sake of character development.-The acting is okay. Somewhat unremarkable. Pierce Brosnan did have a really good moment. I think he cared about the role, he's just not a great actor.-The action and spy stuff is generic. And somewhat over-the-top at times. I did like that Pierce Brosnan's character was good at his job, whatever that is.-The music is bland.-Is that all? Okay then.-Content: it is rated-R for some language, some partial nudity, and a non-explicit sex scene. Not worth it.-So The November Man had Pierce Brosnan and a few scenes that aren't too bad, but it's generic, unfocused, and consisting. Mix that with the content and it is not worth seeing. I am going to give it another 6/10.",The November Man
90,craig-hopton,Bad acting. Excellent plot.,7,17 November 2015,"A good spy action flick. The strength of The November Man is in its twist-filled plot. There is more double- and triple- crossing than I've seen in a long while. I lose count, but there may even have been a quadruple-crossing at the very end.Sadly the acting is not great. Pierce Brosnan was a great spy when he was a suave James Bond armed with martinis and gadget-filled cars, but when he's asked (as here in the character of Devereux) to be gritty, ruthless and hands-on, he can't pull it off.The bad guys aren't particularly memorable either, cover the full range of stereotypes from Russian politicos to emotionless assassins.Then there's Mason played by Luke Bracey, who is supposedly Debereux's protégé but is repeatedly and effortlessly outwitted by him. Olga Kurylenko probably put in the best performance of the film, as Alice, the social worker with a mysterious past.However I do like a good plot and The November Man certainly provided that. A movie you can happily wile away an evening with and most likely will have forgotten about a month later.",The November Man

There is plenty of action and brosnan shows he still has the cool swagger he showed in his bond reign all in all a worthy effort and with the brilliant supporting acts of Luke bracey and olga kurylenko you cant go wrong. It may be the same old USA vs the russians but at least with this one its a fair battle and a realistic one too",The November Man
92,CowherPowerForever,"Know what we used to call you Peter? The November Man. Cause after you passed through, nothing lived.",7,17 September 2014,"Yes, if you are wondering, the line in my summary is completely absurd. That is how movies like this should be. Completely over the top taglines that leave you questioning its logic. This film is not perfect, nor does it ever try to be. The action is fun and the acting is generally above average. This is basically a fun filled spy thriller that stars an actor who use to play James Bond. This is my review of The November Man.The film was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek. Finch is known for his work in the 2010 film Predators, while Gajdusek is known for the 2013 hit Oblivion starring Tom Cruise. The film was based on a novel written by Bill Granger entitled There Are No Spies. While I never read the book, this film is a whole lot of fun, with some plot twist towards the end of the film that may shock you. The plot is basically your typical spy thriller line. A former CIA agent gets activated once again for another mission. We have seen it before, that is very much true, however with some nicely written characters and some plot twists that will keep you engaged, it delivers the edge that makes this film enjoyable. There are some slower scenes throughout the film but, I generally wasn't bothered by them. The acting(which is not bad) carries the film past those slower scenes. Overall, the effort from Finch and Gajdusek is not very much impressive but, these two deliver an enjoyable story which is made better by some nice action scenes and acting.The film was directed by Roger Donaldson who is known for directing bigger action movies like this. One of my favorite films that he directed, was the 2008 movie, The Bank Job. A fantastic movie in my opinion. I wouldn't say the action in this film is big and explosive throughout the film but, there are plenty of action scenes to please your appetite. There is also a good bit of bloody scenes in this film, which is able to hit the screen because of its R rating. I wouldn't call this a hard R film but, watching the movie you can see why it got the rating it did. The action isn't perfect nor bad. The star of the film is Pierce Brosnan and he fits amazingly in this film. It was great to see him back on the big screen kicking butt like he use to do years ago. While I would say Bronsnan does a good job in this film, I would say Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton pull of their roles off overall more effectively. I won't go deep into their stories but these guys have been talented actors for years, and it shows in this film. Overall, Donaldson delivers a fun action film with some nicely shot scenes, and also commands this nice cast to a good job of acting for the most part.Marco Beltrami composed the score for this film. Beltrami recently worked on The Giver and Snowpiercer. I like some good pulse pounding scores in my action films, cheesy is always a nice touch but, I felt his score for the most part added no depth. I wouldn't say his effort scoring this film was poor but, it was easily average at best.In closing, this is simply a fun action film starring Pierce Brosnan who deserves more roles like this. The movie is slightly slow at times but, I never really felt bored during the course of this film. Action fans such as my self will likely enjoy this movie a good deal. Those who were on the fence, I would recommend seeing it right away but, waiting for a home video rental may not be the worst idea if you really aren't big into films like this.7/10",The November Man
93,TheSeaLion,I don't know what happened in this movie,1,1 September 2014,"Of all of the overly confusing movies I have seen in my life, this one is the most unique out of all of them. All of the other films I have seen were confusing because too much was forced into it and or the story was made overly complex. This film, on the other hand, is confusing because of how little anything is explained or makes sense.Starting off with a past mission, Agents Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) and Mason (Luke Bracey) are assigned to stop the assassination of an ambassador. Devereaux orders Mason not to do anything do to the assassin's position, but Mason kills the assassin, resulting in a civilian also being killed. This opening served no purpose as we barely learn anything about the characters and it doesn't serve any purpose to later events in the film.Cut to several years later, Devereaux is asked by his friend Hanley (Bill Smitrovich) to go on a mission to extract an agent who has information on a Russian politician (Lazar Ristovski) who is running for president. The agent, Natalia (Mediha Musliovic), happens to be the mother of Devereaux's daughter. Devereaux attempts to extract her, but she is shot and killed by Mason under orders from Perry Weinstein (Bill Patton). Natalia manages to give Devereaux her phone with pictures that would incriminate the politician. Instead of turning the pictures over to the C.I.A, whom Mason is an agent for, Devereaux goes not only after Mason because he wants to kill him, but a woman named Alice (Olga Kurylenko) as well because she might know where a person is who knows inside information regarding the politician. Joining in on the hunt for Alice is Weinstein's C.I.A group, including Mason, and a hired assassin (Amila Terzimehic).Starting right here is when the movie starts to become complete confusion. Devereaux wants to protect Alice to keep everyone from reaching the girl, Mira, who would know about the politician. However, he doesn't give the incriminating pictures to anyone or post them online to show what the politician did. At the same time, Devereaux wants to kill Mason, for some reason. He acts as if it is because he views Mason as a murderer, but if that were the real case Devereaux would have killed Mason right after Mason killed Natalia when he had the chance to. Plus, he was following orders to kill Natalia, but Devereaux is blaming him for the killing and then nearly kills Mason's sudden girlfriend Sarah (Eliza Taylor) to teach him a lesson. Devereaux's motivations throughout the entire movie make no sense, and we are supposed to understand and sympathize with him.It is revealed that Hanley was working with the politician the whole time. The reveal that Hanley and the politician are working together also leads to the reveal that Hanley has been controlling the politician the whole time and is planning on using him when he's president. However, their plan or even their actions in the present are not what makes them the villains of the movie. They are the villains because they did some bad things over a decade ago, so there is no real urgency to any of it. Their present plans are not evil, so there is no real rush to stop them. Remember how I said barely anything was revealed in the opening of the movie, well, here's what was revealed. Other than the fact that Devereaux says Mason can't follow orders, we learn that Mason is looking for a partner to have in his life. What does that lead to? A pointless subplot involving Mason and his neighbor Sarah. They introduce themselves to one another, they go out on a date, Devereaux injures her as revenge, and she goes to the hospital. And that's the last we see of her. She doesn't show up at the end with Mason somewhere. She just disappears from the story.Another character who just disappears from the story is Edgar Simpson (Patrick Kennedy), a reporter for the New York Times who is doing a report on the Russian politician. He shows up to ask Alice some questions about what she knows about the politician and where he can find Mira. Alice goes to his house later on and he is killed. What was the point of his character? Nothing. He was just thrown in and made the whole story more confusing.How is it as an action spy thriller? Terrible. Are there some decent fights and action sequences in it. Sure, but those few moments are ruined by the fact that you have no idea what is going on in the plot, so you have no idea what the point of the action scene is.""The November Man"" might be the most confusing movie I have ever seen in my life. The majority of the character's motivations make little sense, the villain's plan isn't even villainous or hold much weight to the final effect of the film, the characters are underdeveloped, and the entire thing is just convoluted. I remember when I saw ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" that I said the evil plan was convoluted. Well, compared to this movie that plan is pretty straight forward, and at least that plan held weight to it. Like I said, there were a few decent action sequences in there, but they aren't worth sitting through the whole movie to see.",The November Man

The November Man may not excel in any one area, but all the parts do fit together nicely. I find the message this film presents absolutely fascinating. There is perhaps one character with a soul or conscience, but even she is willingly co-opted into the madness before the film ends. Pay careful attention to the meaning of the title when defined. There is no restraint shown on anyone who gets in the way of guns, knives, vehicular homicide, or hardware store implements. Hooray for sociopaths! This film is a celebration of self serving antics and goals. I guess the moral is don't be a target. Surprisingly, I did like this movie - but I'm still trying to figure out why",The November Man

Brosnan with his James Bond experience plays a believable agent despite his age. The surprises are there, but they are kind of fabricated.

98,supatube,A well-rounded meal complete with unnecessary side orders and condiments,6,28 August 2014,"He is the November Man because, like November, once he passes through nothing survives - they really ride this title all the way to the end when ex-CIA agent Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) plows through people as if he were picking berries near the end of season. Espionage films reek of advert like shots to capture just how cool the agent is while shooting, throwing, punching and blowing stuff up and ""The November Man"" surpassingly avoids that in large part due to what Mr Brosnan can actually do. The film starts with Devereaux on a mission that goes wrong due to the younger agent Mason (Luke Bracey) who kills an innocent bystander. Fast-forward to five years later and Devereaux has been living in Switzerland when he's pulled into another job in Belgrade that proves more personal – therefore irresistible. Things go wrong; revenge develops alongside uncovering the true conspiracy with hot Olga Kurylenko clinging to the side for protection and Mason making a return.There is a side-line plot of a contract killer Alexa (Amila Terzimehic) out to kill/capture Alice (Olga Kurylenko) but that very confusion on the killers real intent for Alice makes it awkward to watch. This sidebar character never really develops to anything more than a cheap window in the red light district on your way to the real show. Nothing can be more infuriating to watch than a storyline that is only there to help another characters motives – in this case Alexa scares Alice and makes trusting Devereaux so much more plausible, that's it. As far as spy movies go ""The November Man"" hits it spot on with a true professional mauling through guys, with guns, quickly and with precision. Brosnan has surely proved his espionage acting skill however, the story of 'the ex-agent coming back because the agency he has pledged his life too is not as golden as was promised' might feel more like a déjà vu. But since when was a spy movie denuded of some repetition? Didn't Pierce Brosnan play a spy before? The story does seem to drag and there is far more scenes of characters telling us the plot instead of some visceral visual that allows the truth to explode in our minds. The characters tell us, cue the music - soundtrack overdrive with scenes more emotive than thrilling are left to ride what the audience should be feeling. Weak. The film also clings to some misogynistic clichés but then again what thrilling espionage film would be completely devoid of some sort of misogyny? Isn't that a main root in the foundation of that Bond guy?Nonetheless I found this movie pretty awesome, not groundbreaking, just a film where the people who made it, all had their hearts in the right place. What it lacked in drive it made up for by avoiding cheese. What it lacked in the use of sub-characters was made up for by avoiding cheese and the film managed to avoid even more cheese while entering predictable-espionage- land. What I am trying to say is that not once did I roll my eyes at the lame selling points, like an advert, which are sauced over espionage films of late. It kept a slick symbiosis to its action and main character that managed a beautiful well rounded meal complete with unnecessary side orders and condiments but not lathered in cheese.",The November Man
99,thomas-w15,Pierce Brosnan is no longer James Bond,5,20 November 2014,"The November Man- I will be honest, I saw this movie because there was nothing else to see. I was not thrilled to see this film because like most of you thought, it looks like they are just trying to make it look like an old-new James Bond movie. Believe me, Pierce Brosnan, while he may have played James Bond, plays a character much different than his world-famous role. While it may have some flaws, especially in the plot, The November Man delivers on being a solid action-thriller that gives you just enough to keep you entertained.My biggest problem with the film is how it never really gives a solid basis of the the main character's personality and the basis for his actions. A message is being driven out about how he is not a hero in some scenes, but then does all of the heroic actions in other scenes. You never get a sense of what kind of guy Agent Devereaux is. The problems most people had with the movie are probably the confusing plot. What I'm saying is, it takes the film a while before the audience finally knows what's going on and what the objective is. These two flaws are the only real things that bugged me and most other people in the theater. The two flaws though do not keep you from enjoying the movie.There is not exactly anything extraordinary The November Man accomplishes, but there are a couple things that it did well. Mainly, the well-crafted intense scenes. Multiple times in this movie, I was literally at the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen, who was going to live and who was going to die. All the credit goes to the director, the music composer, and Pierce Brosnan who has not at all lost his touch. He delivers his best performance since Die Another Day. The screenwriter may not have a gift for clear-cut plots, but the director saves it with his talent at making intense, emotional scenes that keep everyone in the theater watching the screen every step of the way in the scene. Any average movie goer can tell that this film is not without it's faults, but if you like edge of the seat, slightly dark thrillers, I recommend you see this movie at some point.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",The November Man
100,tgrock,Better than 'Die Another Day',5,21 November 2014,"This the Pierce Brosnan Bond film that never got made. They go back to the gritty action of the underrated ""The World Is Not Enough"" in this film. The plot takes awhile to develop the motivations of the characters and can be confusing. It makes sense at the end of the movie, but one of the twists of the film is not done very smoothly. Overall, the film tries to be more than it is. Yet, it fails. There are some annoying characters. Heck, even Pierce Brosnan sometimes acts in ways where you are like, ""Why is acting like this? Why is he doing this?""The action is not really spectacular either. I rarely was ever thrilled during it. Brosnan's character pretty much never misses except for when he wants to. So, that is disappointing.If this was the last Bond movie that Brosnan made instead of ""Die Another Day"", then his tenure as the hero wouldn't have been so tarnished and they maybe would have had him make another film instead of rebooting the franchise. Thankfully, they did reboot it though.",The November Man
101,ActionFan-Reviews,Surprisingly Good - Pierce Own's It!!,6,31 August 2014,"When I first viewed the trailer for ""The November Man"", I thought it looked average and kind of like a straight to DVD movie. So my girlfriend and I were looking for a movie to watch and I suggested this and went in with low/average expectations. I must say, I was surprised by the movie and how entertaining and thrilling it was. First things first, Pierce Brosnan proves he still has that charisma and flair which most people seen when he played James Bond, he brings that same level of personality to the role and is just pure bad ass and cool as ""The November Man"". I felt the actors all did a wonderful job from Luke Bracey as the cocky, young, and easy to hate protégé to the smoking hot Olga Kurylenko. The story may seem predictable and simple, but is still intriguing,thrilling and provides for some edge of the seat excitement. The action comes fast, bloody and unexpectedly. The scenes are shot with crisp and it will invigorate your adrenaline rush for all the action junkies out there. Like many of the reviews have pointed out, the story takes some twists and turns which may leave the viewer confused. It still provides an above average, edge of your seat, action thriller.Overall, a decent popcorn flick that will surely entertain. It has a little bit of everything. Action, suspense, thrills, drama, humor and is surprisingly quite entertaining. It will surely make you gasp or jump at least once! Don't listen to Rotten Tomatoes, go watch and judge for yourself. 6.5/10",The November Man

He was very focused on his character and it was very believable acting on his part. And Olga is always a very believable rock solid actress. The plot was very interesting and had a great supporting cast. I also thought it was interesting to see the different locations the story took the viewer to as well. The dude that played the 2nd lead did a great job as well and I liked how they presented his character with all of the complications that his profession came with, and how that job would affect your conscience and the inner conflict of what kind of a person you think you are, what you were, where you are going, and what can you do to affect where you will end up as a person. I thought it was a great movie in every way and a rock solid 10.",The November Man
103,Reef-Shark,Pierce Brosnan delivers solid performance in otherwise forgettable action film,6,30 August 2014,"Ever wonder what would have happened if Pierce Brosnan had been handed a more gritty Bond script from, say, the Timmothy Dalton or Daniel Craig tenure? That's what we're given in The November Man, a serviceable spy thriller from Relativity Media starring the former 007 himself.Here Pierce Brosnan plays ex-CIA operative Peter Devereaux, a cold, hard drinking killer who hardly thinks twice about killing. Brought back into the field he winds up in a plot concerning the future of international politics. Naturally the entire operation goes to hell and Devereaux finds himself alone and on the run from the CIA and Russian assassins as he tries to find the mysterious woman at the center of it all.The real standout in The November Man is Pierce Brosnan himself who really does go above and beyond in his portrayal of Devereaux. Many modern viewers criticize Brosnan's Bond for being on the lighter side, but clearly that had more to do with the series direction and scripts than Brosnan himself. He totally sells the role of a cold blood, professional killer in The November Man and leaves you wondering how things might have been if his tenure as Bond had taken a darker direction. Watching him here I found myself thinking: ""Man, give Pierce Brosnan one last Bond film as an aging 007 and he'd be FANTASTIC."" Scenes where he confronts his former protégé are especially well executed. As it stands this will be the closest we get to seeing Brosnan play a dark Bond and it is the best element of the film. If you're a fan of Brosnan -as I am- this is reason enough to see The November Man.Unfortunately, as great as Brosnan is, the movie's plot doesn't live up to his performance. The November Man is needlessly complicated, constantly introducing new plot threads, conflicts, and twists that only serve to muddle the narrative flow. There is nothing wrong with a complex spy thriller, but it needs to be original and The November Man just doesn't bring anything new to the table. There is nothing awful about it, there's just very few memorable moments (and all those hinge on Brosnan's performance).The November Man could have really benefited from a more focused plot. If the filmmakers had narrowed it down to one or two primary plots and simplified the narrative it would have really been a solid action thriller along the lines of Taken. As it is there are just too many predictable twists and clichés and they pull the film down.That all being said The November Man is definitely worth a matinée screening in cinemas or rental once it's available at home. At 61 Pierce Brosnan successfully proves he can still carry an action film and shows he can tackle far darker roles than many gave him credit. Even if I don't think The November Man is a knockout it has whet my appetite for future Brosnan action films which hopefully can deliver a script worthy of his talent and on screen charisma.",The November Man
104,homdeb1058,Not James Bond--Thank Goodness,8,10 September 2014,"I actually enjoyed this movie more than I expected. To me it was a welcome break from the smug, ridiculously over-the-top super tech, CGI enhanced offerings of the James Bond and Mission Impossible sort. More of the old fashion action and character driven movie that was what spy vs spy used to be before they became an ongoing one-up-man-ship gadget/tech/CGI competition. The plot develops in a fairly straight forward manner (without artificial obfuscation to make it seem more important than it is), with a couple of twists to keep it interesting. Gunshots and knife wounds were pretty graphic--again, not over the top, but they didn't try to cut away from them either.While there may have been a few awkward scenes, the acting was, for the most part, decent in my book, as well--with no huge stars but many recognizable ones. I could actually hear and understand 99.9% of the dialog. Frankly an amazing job for a $15 million dollar budget, compared to the crap movies they crank out for $100 and $200 million. I'm sure I'll rent it to watch it again when it come out on DVD.",The November Man

I lost interest when pierce flipped the guy off and said sit on this and twist.. something I have never said, not even in high school..but I can understand why a hardened ex CIA agent would say it.. after two days i decided to finish it.. and if I'm being honest I feel stupid for doing so.. its just so stupid.. the female assassin is supposed to be the best right? but she can't kill the girl in the lamest attempts ever.. she gets stopped by a guy whose throat she just cut when he grabs one of her legs.. are you kidding me.. how do you not have a gun.. and do you know what else is completely stupid.. two Americans just happen to live across the hall from each other in Russia?? come on at least have the woman who doesn't really have a reason to be in the movie be from the country they live in.. or heres an idea take her out of the movie.. other than getting her leg cut she has no purpose.. why should i believe this guy who says ""i don't give a fork about the people I've killed actually cares about a girl he slept with once heehaw its just pathetic.. now lets talk about the action.. I Have Never Seen Such A Lame Slow Motion Action Scene In My Life pretty much all the action is slow motion i don't know if thats to make it more believable or if its because Bronson is too old to make it look good.... Finally the plot twist.. its so lame i barely even noticed.. the worst part is the loving embrace when he describes to the scared girl how fast a bullet travels and how she won't feel anything when she dies.. loll it felt like the wrong time for a loving hand on the face... of course no terrible movie is complete without a typical stupid strip club scene, or the part where the name of the movie is incorporated into the film and of course Russian roulette... Its terrible for many more reasons but I'm sure nobody will read the review about a movie they don't even care about.. so the end..",The November Man
107,toddxdavis,Mediocre at best,3,4 January 2015,"All Brosnan does is yell, run, and look grimaced (ala H Ford, another one-dimensional guy who has one method). He's not an actor. Fortunately Olga Kurylenko provides a bit of eye candy, unfortunately she under acts through most of the film. It lacks energy, does not inspire, and Brosnan should be cast as a used RV salesman.I did not like the film. Who decided bad films require a minimum number of lines in a review?

No relationship whatsoever to the date the movie was released. I found that this was quite a good version of the usual spy movie, where there is a new spy trying to take over from the older spy, but lacks the skill necessary to take him down.......goes to show that experience wins out over new techniques and young inexperienced agents need to spend time listening watching and thereby learning from the older agents....don't put them out to pasture yet!",The November Man
109,ace_nair,A spy thriller with a lot of twists,7,1 December 2014,"Based on a novel There Are No Spies by Bill Granger, this story is from a series of books under the 'The November Man' series.Brosnan plays Peter Devereaux (aka The November Man), a retired CIA officer who is recruited by his ex-boss to extract an undercover operative working for the notorious presidential candidate and former army general Federov. As Federov has a lady assassin in play, it becomes vital for Devereaux to move quickly which he does.To cut the story short, the operative has a name which can destroy Federov. She gets made by the Russians but is rescued by Devereaux but unfortunately doesn't make it. The CIA is now after the person behind the name and all leads points to a social worker played by Olga. Devereaux saves her and then sets on a mission to find the truth, which believe-it-or-not comes with various twists in the tale!It was nice to watch Brosnan return to an action movie, although I couldn't but help think of Bryan Mills and the Taken movies; however he seems to be a little more ruthless than Mills. To remind you that Brosnan is a star from the 80s and 90s there is a love-making scene which was totally not required (and it didn't even feature Brosnan).If you like spy stories or Brosnan then you should watch 'The November Man'.",The November Man
110,Filmfandave,Bedlam in Belgrade,7,31 December 2014,"The November Man tells about an ex-CIA operative Peter Deveraux (Pierce Brosnan) who is forced into action after his ex-wife is murdered. Director Roger Donaldson's effort in this espionage thriller is quite laudable even though the subplots could have been more intelligent.The film has too many characters and subplots that are not given proper conclusions – the romance between Deveraux's protégé Mason (Luke Bracey) and his next-door girlfriend, and his professional relationship with his mentor in the end don't wrap up as they should have been. Then, there are scenes that do not really make sense: when Mira (Olga Kurylenko) threatens to kill Federov in his hotel room. The film could have ended there without Deveraux having to break into the hotel suite shooting left and right, which is just the scriptwriters' way to let audience see Deveraux in action. Another scene which is just hilariously over the top is during the fight between Deveraux and Mason inside the hotel boiler room where we see Mason getting hit on the face with some sort of a pipe and whatnot but he keeps fighting back without showing any pain. The trailer is misleading too. It makes audience think the movie is about a confrontation between an ex-CIA master spy and his protégé, which is actually only a subplot.Overall, despite its shortcoming, the film comes recommended for those who love espionage thrillers. 7.5 out of 10.",The November Man

In the entire movie you can see Brosnan's struggle to make the character lines and posture work's,without using that Bond charm he just cant stop bringing during the film.Other problem is the story, very predictable, if you usually watch movies you will discover all the plot twists.

Pierce Brosnan tries to act like a jaded tough guy, but despite all the cussing he can't hide the urbanity and sophistication that made him the perfect Bond, so perhaps he was a bit miscast here, or he tries too hard to get away from that character. The David Mason character has perhaps the most development, someone with a heart that we can relate to. Like most films, there's lots of cannon fodder (how do these guys get their jobs if they're that bad?). Ultimately, the good guys come through and the bad guys get their comeuppances one way or another. My main complaint is that the right-hand henchman of the film doesn't get a proper Hollywood showdown; in fact, it's a major letdown. The top henchman should be the keynote fight for the protagonist, no? The ultimate test? Maybe the film makers deliberately tried to be different in this case. If so, they shouldn't have, as the viewer gets robbed of something you are naturally looking forward to. It's like the WWF without a main event. And also, one scene is more in-your-face than we need. We get it, stop hitting us in the head with a sledgehammer. (You will know what I mean.)",The November Man

I've been off Brosnan in the last couple of years since Bond, though he's a brave actor and has tried various roles. This one puts him firmly back in the action mould. His character Devereaux could take Bond with one arm behind his back - well not perhaps not Daniel Craig but he'd give him a run for his money. It was as gritty a performance as I have ever seen from Brosnan and ranks alongside the current Bond and Bourne for tension and is not far behind for action.

This is a movie that is unfolding through several threads, coming together at the end, clarifying the characters.I do not need to add any words about the plot. It may seem puzzling to those who are used to be fed the cliché clues, overstating what comes next, but I think it was a very good plot and well executed. True, there should have been some more depth in the acting to enjoy but that would contradict the cold professionalism which is inherent to CIA, hit men and war criminals.I say, make sure your IQ is three digits worth and enjoy this movie which does evoke 007 much, but harsher.",The November Man

The excess nudity, sex scenes and excess profanity really shocked me! It was totally not necessary to the plot or essence of the movie! I began to wonder if they were just fillers. Perhaps, the writers didn't have anything else to add to the plot to make it exciting. I really didn't expect this from Bronson.

The pacing is off. It feels slow and sluggish at times and things happen exactly when you expect them to happen. Best part of the movie was when Kurylenko hit the assassin following her with a shovel. It feels as if Brosnan is just going through the motions as he has been on this ride a couple of times before. Kurylenko was not bad and played her role pretty well. Bracey was trying very hard to stay with Brosnan but most scenes he over acted.

Well 007 finds her and then she dies and he's said because he wanted to get lucky.The film continues and a lot of twists happen (I only know this because they start talking more intensely).

144,markhiwater,Two Sides of the Same Coin?,10,5 September 2014,"Two men, each with a secret: One secret is good and the other is bad. Secrets exert profound influence on each character's life. Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) is trying to hide his ties to his daughter and daughter's mother. General Arkady Federov ((Lazar Ristovski) covered up his involvement in war crimes in the Chechen War. Devereaux is the penultimate corporate achiever, retired in December 2008 (12-08) and the ""bad guy"" General Arkady Federov is purely self-serving yet his combination to his safe is a date (12-3- 08): does the movie tell us these archetype characters are two sides of the same coin? A sense of depth is added to the film when you realize Pierce Brosnan dedicated his own resources in Irish Dreamtime to tell this story in Bill Granger's ""Peter Devereaux"" novels. The amazing development of this well-told tale is when Devereaux looses his cornerstones in life and has to put it all back together. The plot brings out the breaking point that makes us all human by turning Devereaux's former pupil (Luke Bracey) and his former ""spy handler"" (Bill Smitrovich) against him. This heaps chaos onto Devereaux after loosing his secret wife (Mediha Musilovic) to a spy operation.The characters seem to all have a bit of good and bad in them. The right circumstances can make each of the characters play out whatever it is they believe in. You might wonder if even the bad characters plan to turn over a new leaf and prevent the same mistakes for others. But in the end, we see a glimpse of the International Court system attempting to unravel crimes of the Chechen War.",The November Man

The story is good, flows well and Kurylenko lights up the screen, however I felt that apart from these two the other characters felt a little lightweight, even Luke Braceys character (who I am looking forward to seeing in Point Break) only gave glimpses of 'why'.Overall it is a good film, I would recommend and I would watch again.",The November Man

153,andrew_rigsby,Not quite Bond anymore,6,15 September 2014,"Viewed: September 15, 2014. Location: Theater Summary: Exceptional theater experience. Company: FamilyI will start by saying that I am a huge Pierce Brosnan fan and Goldeneye is one of my favorite Bond films of all time. I am also a HUGE bond fan as well so I had some high set expectations going into this film. Overall opinion: The movie had good intentions. It is as if they had a good script that just needed a couple of more drafts to really be great and they just skipped that part and started filming. Over all it isn't a bad movie, a little rough around the edges but not bad. The action is not very well choreographed but it does provide entertainment. The problem was the plot, they almost had too much going on and used cut scenes a little too much. As the viewer, you still understand the story but it makes it somewhat redundant and confusing. Brosnan's character seems old and you can tell that he has lost his edge. His counter part, Luke Bracey, was not a very good actor either. He didn't add any emotion to the movie and didn't sell any of the parts he played except the ""Im a hired killer"" part. It sucked because I was expecting a mono e mono type situation such as in Killer Elite, instead we got an old man who has lost his edge teamed up and then against and then teamed up with a young kid who cant act. Who I liked: Olga Kurylenko I did NOT like Olga because she was in Quantum of Solace, although I did think she was the shining star of that movie. I liked her because yet again she had a way of developing a shallow character into someone of depth and value by the end. She is a very talented actor and stood out throughout this movie amongst poor acting and bad action. She gave the movie not only a sense of purpose but a depth and emotion as well. Quick Summary: Bond fans will be disappointed, action buffs will be bored, and thillers wont get the ride they signed up for, go watch Goldeneye or Killer Elite instead.",The November Man

It was an excitement when we see Pierce Brosnan after a gap of 12 long years acting as a CIA spy but sadly November Man was not the spy we want to remember Pierce. It gives a feeling Pierce is replicating Daniel Criag of Quantum of Solace in November Man. The charmed spy who took Bond to its best level is lost in this big 12 year gap. As the move goes on you feel there is a struggle between an Old spy and a new spy to score top in a spy chase game. To the worst the new spy looked so dull that you get the feeling and ask yourself that whether he is acting as a spy in the movie or he is proving he is a hunk. There is hardly any good delivery of dialogue from this Australian. He tries his best to make you believe he is a smart one but in the whole movie he is being proved wrong. The narrative and plot of the move is just so outdated and mismatched. You get a Chechen war this time and updated version of cold war which turns out to be a yawning and predictable in the rest part of the story. The good part is Brosnan still holds those expressions and acting which we loved him in his Bond movie. It's sad that he chooses this film for his comeback but piece of advice he should be more careful when he comes as a spy because his Bond is still fresh in the audience mind.,The November Man
156,yahko_kun,"Decent Story, Bad Execution",6,5 January 2015,"I found that this movie had a great base for a decent chase and catch spy movie. The reason it falls short is that Pierce's character isn't believable as an operative for the CIA. All we get from him is this cocky ""do as I tell"" kind of guy with no believable operative skills. We are given a little background on his training techniques but they almost feel out of place and don't fit into the movie. He is marked as an operative that went rouge yet we don't feel the heat on him or the real chase. Same great example was portrayed in the Bourne series but those felt believable and kept us on edge.Another part of the move that falls short is the overall storyline. It feels like there are many scenes that seem to be unrelated one to another. Some action scenes were put in order to create action but they either made no sense or were put into a vacuum which is isolated from the overall movie environment. Action movies do have characters shooting guns in the middle of the street where no one bats and eye but in this movie it was more noticeable than others, for some reason.The movie tries to create character development but isn't able to connect us to the individual actors and the characters they portray.",The November Man

On one of the pursuit scenes a drone goes after to film the action and everyone realize that it is just impossible for the drone (that specific model) to go at the same speed of the cars. At the end everything is so predictable, with no reason one guy turns from one side to the other, the main bad guy confess with no much trouble, some of the main characters never appear again, and bad guys fail.

There are a lot of chase scenes that lead to nowhere and it's got a big, booming sound track. I have always been a fan of Brosnan. He is fine in the part, as is the rest of the cast. It's the editing and directing here that makes this film a mess. Nothing here is remotely like the sophistication of a Bond film, although it seems to have been marketed with that feel.

Casino Royale and Daniel Craig gave me hope, but that was short-lived ...But this ISN'T a James Bond movie, and that's a good thing. November Man isn't a Jason Bourne movie either, and that's a better thing. What it is though is a much more believable story where the actors are allowed to be human beings instead of one dimensional cartoon characters or superheroes. That's not a knock against the Bourne flicks, they're great action thrillers, but November Man is a different sort of movie altogether. There's a decent amount of action, but just like in real life the car chases don't go on forever, gunfights are sudden and often surprising, and fight scenes are short, brutal, and painful.One way of putting it would be to say this is a spy/covert ops movie for grown-ups. There's plenty of tension even if you see one of the two main plot twists coming as I did, in fact that adds to the tension. Of course it's not 'realistic' either, no one would watch a realistic spy movie because it would be so boring the screenwriters would fall asleep before finishing the first scene. November Man has what I judge to be a good blend of intrigue, action, and interesting characters. And because the two main characters are believable with room to grow both personally and in their not so amicable relationship, a sequel or three might have been equally entertaining.If you're expecting a suave James Bond spy in the style of Connery (the REAL James Bond), Moore, or Brosnan you'll want to give this a pass, but if the grittier Bond that Craig gave us in Casino Royale appeals to you, then do your self a favor and check this out.",The November Man

165,ntitley-70-615408,It's a spy flick; expect action and some clichés,6,15 September 2014,"Peter Devereaux (Pierce Brosnan) is a retired CIA agent that left the game to settle down. Devereaux, code name ""November Man,"" is called into action by an old counterpart to help recover valuable information about a target that's linked to a Russian official. Devereaux and his protégé David Mason (Luke Bracey) have spent some time apart, but working for the same agency has brought them back together and has set them against each other in bitter conflict. Now, Devereaux must find the woman everyone is after and deal with his protégé Mason, as the hunter has become the hunted and by the person he trained. James Bond...whoops! I almost forgot he's not Bond anymore, but the movie felt like it because Olga was the Bond girl opposite Daniel Craig in Quantum of Solace. Pierce Brosnan was amazing and some will say he's the best part of this movie. He played an older, retired spy that's brought back into the game and he not only looked the part, but he acted the part with a kind of style and ruthlessness that shows he had experience as Bond. He seemed to really take his role seriously and it made watching him work even more enjoyable. I valued Devereaux's use of psychology and wit, as it showcased a different skill-set that I haven't seen in sometime.His supporting cast...I'd say had mixed reviews, but I felt Luke Bracey played the role of the protégé. Luke played a young, emotional, and trying to be detached character. I could see it in Luke's face, he looked like he was trying to remain cold, trying to get a grip on his emotions, but you could see the angry, young, inexperienced ""protégé""role coming through in his acting. If this was the purpose, then he hit the ball on the head and the idea of him being a ""protégé"" to Pierce could be a springboard for him in later movies.So about the other supporting casting members...Let's look at Olga; every time I see her in a movie I'm worried the movie will flop. I don't mean this disrespectfully, nor do I dislike her, I actually like her in movies and want to see more of her, but the problem is the roles she fills. Have you seen her in the trailer or the poster? She played roles like this ""Hitman"" and in ""Quantum of Solace."" If you've seen her in the those movies you know she plays the damsel in distress, who's being chased and yet pretends to be tough, but ends up dressing like a prostitute to get close to a man in power (usually the villain or anti-hero). It's no different here folks; she keeps taking roles like this and whenever I see her in a colored wig I know what she's doing and I can immediately spot where the plot might go. Again, she's not a bad actress and she has other roles, but I just see the plot coming from a mile away when I see her do something like this.The other cast members weren't anything to brag about, except for a few interesting scenes. I can't tell you anyone in this movie gave an Oscar-winning performance. Let's make this clear; this movie is entertaining, but it doesn't compel me to get out of my seat and clap, nor did it challenge me to think beyond my daydreams. This is a spy movie; the moment I heard: ""he's the best at what he does,"" I knew some clichés were coming. I feel clichés are difficult to avoid in spy movies because unless you're a spy from outer space with completely different tactics and emotions, you're going to see some similarities because spies aren't exactly trained that differently. Think of this, isn't every spy they call out of retirement the best at what they do? Pierce's character takes on that cliché role for sure, but can he really help it? However with roles like Olga's you're bound to have some issues.The plot had some interesting twists that made me smile. I liked being surprised when the plot twists came about. Unfortunately, the plot did have a few holes and confusing story pieces, but nothing to hold your head and cry. My biggest issue with the movie was something I best characterize as a ""shift."" Whether it's in the pace, the plot or the quality of the movie, these ""shifts"" tend to happen and they don't usually pan out well...It felt like the movie started on an incredible note, got progressively better and then suddenly things ""shifted"" and I had no idea how some characters ended up where they did. There was no mention of how it really happened and it just didn't make sense. There's also some built up tension between characters in the movie that we don't really see settled. I'm trying not to spoil it, but believe me when I say there's a shift in the movie and when it happened I tried not to take notice. Again, a few pieces (not many) don't add up; none of these issues ruined the movie for me, nor did they spoil my experience.The action was excellent in most cases and cliché in others, and the dialog may have been confusing in a few scenes, but the movie set out to entertain and I felt it did just that. I give this movie a 6.5 or 7 at best. Again, entertaining movie and Pierce Brosnan was easily one of the best parts, the plot wasn't bad and I enjoyed the twists. If you can tolerate cliché spy movies, awkward scenes and somewhat confusing dialog (only because it feels like it went by so quickly), then this movie won't bother you. Regardless, I suggest you watch it. I really enjoyed it and felt it was highly entertaining; despite mixed reviews there's something there if you're looking for a flick this weekend.",The November Man

167,wolfrarw,A Spy is Never Out of The Game,7,19 September 2014,"(NO SPOILERS)When I first heard about the ""November Man"" I was exited to hear that Pierce Brosnan would be doing another spy/action film, since its been 12 years since his last Bond adventure. But after seeing the trailer and hearing some reviews I was afraid this would turn out to be like Stallone's ""Bullet to the Head"" and be a bit of a flop.However, ""The November Man"" is not only a very exiting spy movie, but also is an entertaining action movie as well. It has a perfect blend of slow burn espionage and gritty fight sequences that earn the film its R rating. It's plot is based off of Bill Granger's ""There Are No Spies"" and for the most part flows steadily throughout the run-time. My only major gripe is that one or two scenes could have been cut out entirely and it would not have affected anything.There are a decent amount of action sequences in ""The November Man"", mainly gunfights, fist-fights, and one or two car chases. Instead of having a few longer and more drawn out action scenes, the film has many short burst type scenes, no longer than 3 or 4 minutes. The camera work and cinematography is different, but steers clear of that frustrating shaky cam that is seen in so many modern action movies. My one and only problem with the action was the usage of CGI blood and flares, However, everything else is done for real, it was great to see a film that does not rely on computers and just does stuff practically.I did not have any issues with the performances of the cast, Brosnan, Kurylenko, and Bracy were all believable in their parts but did not provide anything that blew me away.So, ""The November Man"" is a good spy action/thriller movie, with a decent story packed with twists and turns, along with enticing characters, but what sold this movie for me was it's action sequences, that were done (for the most part) practically. I would recommend seeing it for anyone who was a fan of Brosnan's time as 007 or just enjoys action films.",The November Man
168,LxEmberstorm,Predictable and drags on and on,6,29 August 2014,"When I saw the previews for this film, I expected some good old fashioned action-packed spy flick. Well, there's action, but it wasn't good. I was itching for the movie to end long before it did. The plot of the story is pretty predictable and seems obnoxiously serious. There was maybe one or two attempts at a humorous moment, but they fell short and left the film feeling dry. It was surprisingly bloody with a tad bit of gore, which somewhat shocked me initially. The action and violent scenes would have been the redeeming point of the movie, had it not been done with a few slow-mo scenes, which felt weird and misplaced. There was also a fair bit of nudity which also surprised me. The moments were in fair context but I felt that the sex scene drags on too long, to the point of being awkward (especially as I saw the film with a grandparent). There were quite a few F-bombs. The only real bonus to the film besides a way to waste an hour and 48 minutes was Pierce Brosnan's performance. Despite a lackluster plot, Brosnan drove the story forward to it's less than stellar conclusion.",The November Man
169,azbluestein,Excellent and Entertaining,10,31 August 2014,"This is an action movie with good sub plots, always progressing with interesting results. Pierce Brosnan is excellent in his role, and the movie revolves around his dynamic performance with good, believable support from Luke Bracey. Good ""spy thrillers"" have intrigue, real-world characters who are self motivated and sometimes suspicious, and different viewpoints as the different sub plots unfold. This movie, thanks to Pierce, did a good job of creating all of these items in the right amount to tell a good story, while revealing some of his deeper emotions that tie the viewer to the character. Another important aspect is the cine-photography; beautiful cobblestone streets, interesting buildings and a good selection of cityscapes make this one well worth seeing on the big screen.",The November Man
170,legotrekmotion,A Solid Spy Thriller,8,5 September 2014,"The trailers for The November Man promise a spy flick with an old school feel. On that note the film definitely delivers. Pierce Brosnan is back in the spy game and he hasn't lost what it takes to save the world. His portrayal of Peter Devereaux is much darker and more brooding then any of his outings as 007. His performance in this film proves that he could have played Bond in the same vein as Dalton and Craig have, if the producers had decided to go down that path. Luke Bracey does OK with his character of Agent Mason, although there were a few times that I wished the action switched back to Brosnan.In some of the interviews before release, the filmmakers indicated that Devereaux would hand the torch off to Mason. I have never liked those types of films, ones that draw viewers in using an established actor like Brosnan, only to cast him aside for a younger actor to continue a franchise. Happily, this is not the case, and the film rests fully on Pierce Brosnan's character. The overall plot is straightforward and that is probably its biggest downside. Old spy comes back into the game for one last mission, faces off against friend, saves beautiful girl, the whole works. And although some may consider using the Russians as antagonists as cliché, I enjoyed seeing them used in this fashion again. The film is based on an 80's series of books after all. Yet the tried and true nature of the plot is also its saving grace. The film is enjoyable, and isn't that what going to the theater is about? However, I do hope they take the proposed sequels in a slightly more creative direction.It's not all fun and games however. There are some intense scenes throughout, and that is where the film takes a darker turn. One sequence involves a slightly drunk Devereaux confronting Mason in his apartment, while holding his girlfriend at gun and knife point. The scene was very tense, and all the performers were on the top of their game for it. There are plenty of twists and turns in the plot to keep ones interest, although some come and go a bit too quickly to fully appreciate especially in the middle of the movie. The supporting cast does a good job, with Olga Kurylenko (a former Bond girl by the way,)doing well in the fairly meaty role she was given. The cinematography is nicely done, and the music works to carry the story along although there weren't any tracks that really stood out to me.Many negative reviews seem to indicate the viewer expected a Bond movie. This film is NOT a Bond flick. Sure Brosnan played Bond, and he even slips a quick tie adjustment into this film. Although not underwater as in The World is Not Enough. This movie is darker, more personal and much more grounded then any of his four times in the shoulder holster. Go into the theater expecting Bond and you will probably be slightly disappointed. Sit down expecting a solid, tense spy thriller and you will be more than pleased.",The November Man
171,whitelites,"Please, just don't!",3,5 September 2014,"Wait for the video. I was so disappointed by this movie. I almost fell asleep in the theatre. Brosnan seems to just go through the motions, not really involved. The action scenes are mediocre, again nothing new or even exciting. And I can't believe that an assassin who can kill CIA agents can go down with a single whack. And I agree with some of the other reviewers in that there are too many inconsequential extra characters. I saw the movie today and can't even remember the names of the characters, much less the plot, because it was so unexceptional. All the characters in this movie seem lifeless, even the villains. The title doesn't make sense either. If Devereaux (Brosnan's character) is such a killer machine that no one lives once he's on the scene, then why is that November? It's not really explained. Could be I just missed some information because I wasn't paying attention. All in all, a big disappointment.",The November Man
172,TimberWolves1698,The November Man,10,7 September 2014,The November Man was a excellent movie you maybe able to take James bond from Pierce Brosnan but you can't take his intelligence of being a SPY away. Cause no matter what he will always be an amazing spy. I really liked The November Man I give it big thumbs up. I think Pierce Brosnan and all the other characters did an excellent job in the movie. November Man was a great action movie I guess once a spy always a SPY. My favorite part of The November Man was at the end. The ending was amazing. I don't know who would give this movie a thumbs down that's good I thought it was. Who ever likes action movies should go see this movie. It was amazing!!!,The November Man
173,welt-rogg,world aggression,2,16 September 2014,"Creepy scenario kindling world aggression. USA and Hollywood are only able to taunt others. Low level. And this is typical empty action movie like 1.000.000 other. This movie includes a lot of boring pattens from stupid action movies. Pierce Brosnan is just a fistful of pathos and no more. No IQ, no talent, no actors play. Only posing. Sorry of critics but I cant keep silence. Disgusting! I spend time to watch this, and I lost a big part of my time to watch nothing. I have stopped to watch Hollywood movies 2 years age and I have made exception for that film. It was worst rest in my life. And illogical chain of events in ""THE November MAN"" frozen me!!!",The November Man
174,jennsmucker,Best spy thriller since Bourne,10,19 September 2014,"November Man is a hard edged mother of a ride that demands you pay attention. I went back and watched it a second time because it was just to intense to figure out every layer and twist. Between the velocity of pace and the multiple story lines, I guessing these writers must be gamers in their time off. Finally, this is the Brosnan we have been waiting to see. A hard man with only a drop of humanity left that is closer to a bass ass killer than a government agent. And definitely not a spy who would boat in on a mission, slowly gliding through hundreds of torch lights, to get information. Olga is another revelation. Admittedly, Quantum was not her finest hour, but, Alice, her character in this film, might be one of the best performances of her career. That brings me to Luke Bracey. Masculine, likable and a charming opponent for Pierce. Not a star yet, but someone to take note of. Another cool aspect of the film is that it is shot in Serbia which feels like the perfect place to shoot this kind of movie. All the actors were amazing including Lazar, the Russian president elect.This is a spy film that makes you feel like you are witnessing real events. Let's hope they continue to make more.",The November Man
175,kooldude-4141,"Started off as interesting, was a mess halfway....(Possible spoilers)",5,3 September 2015,"I decided to watch this movie not knowing it was based on a novel, haven't read the novel either so don't know if it did justice to the film or not.Coming to the film,was expecting a good movie since it casts Pierce Brosnan as a an American spy.The beginning of the movie seemed interesting, have always liked Pierce Brosnan in the role of a spy. Devereaux (Pirce Brosnan) was a character i couldn't understand, sometimes he acts just like he should, an intelligent spy with amazing skills, can handle tough situation easily, and then sometimes he acts just the opposite making naive mistakes. The story was confusing with lots of loopholes. So in the movie, CIA roams freely in Russia and there are no police. It felt like it was an American territory where Russian police or intelligence had no hold. You can enter a hotel and easily get to the upcoming president of Russia, CIA can do whatever it wants and the world would believe a Chechnyan girl who was physically abused by the antagonist via a email and lastly the Americans would want this girl who had proof even its agents had a hand in starting a war.My score - at best 5.5 The soundtrack was nothing spectacular.",The November Man
176,ln75,I liked it,9,23 September 2014,"I liked ""The November Man."" I thought the plot was straightforward, and when it wasn't then a character made a statement explaining what was happening. So many of these types of movies just have characters running around shooting at one another without details being tied up along the way. I did not feel that way about this movie.I found myself rooting for the good characters, and having fun running alongside the hero. No one is going to win an Oscar, but the acting was well done for this type of movie.It was a good 1.5 hours spent watching a spy thriller where the resolution at the end leaves me without any lingering questions.The movie plot/tempo felt familiar given that I have read the books. I am hoping that more movies with this character are made.P.S. It's a movie, not a film--ease up fellow critics.",The November Man
177,bookmangee,Putin propaganda,1,5 September 2015,"""There Are No Spies"" (1986) by Bill Granger was an exceptional thriller about retired spy Devereaux being called back to service to dig up a Soviet mole. ""The November Man,"" the movie based on the novel, is an abomination.In itself, the film is a mediocre-to-fair production with standard action, twists and subterfuge, worthy of 5 stars on the 10-star scale. It's the underlying story that's the problem. The movie turns Granger's tale on its head by making America the villain in an impossibly far-fetched plot.How bad is ""The November Man""? I wouldn't be surprised if Russian despot Vladimir Putin bankrolled this movie.",The November Man
178,adzimpoh,Not bad at all,7,7 May 2016,"I read some encouraging reviews, that made me check it out on DVD. The 6+ rating is not justified. This IS a good film. Pierce Brosnan is great at acting retired-spy. He still has the old- school Sean Connery style charm. I'd say his way of acting is methodical too. The plot is good too. There are many layers of twists. Playing on the Chechen war story, there is a grueling juxtaposing of war-crime evil, with trying to find light and justice. Action wise, for a retired ex-CIA, there is nothing bad about it. It falls short from Bourne series, sure. But for a chill-thrill (i don't know if there is such a phrase) this movie is there. Not to mention the superb cinematography. Being all around Europe etc. Maybe not an 8, but definitely not 2-3 stars at some rate it at. You see, not everyone is a perfect actor like you are, naysayers.",The November Man
179,devicecontext-85955,Watch The Bourne Supremacy instead,5,4 August 2016,"I understand that this movie targets English-speaking audience behind the proverbial iron curtain. Still a female aid to prospect Russian president driving Niva SUV is something hard to believe. In fact this is pretty lame. And I am not discussing her fake boobs on top of her unbelievably horrible Russian. Guys, spend a few bucks and hire a decent voice-over, Brighton New York perhaps? As a consolation, a few counter-part Russian movies showing Americans I tried to watch, they are way more lame than this one.Russian agent-murderess, her outstanding hooter immediately and obviously reveals her evil nature. Other than that, action, suspense and everything else required for creating a spy story are all present. Still too much of a caricature. Watch The Bourne Supremacy instead.",The November Man
