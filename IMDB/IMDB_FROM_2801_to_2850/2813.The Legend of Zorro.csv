0,TheLittleSongbird,"Decent sequel, but inferior to the first film.",6,8 June 2009,"The first film was very entertaining, with some well-choreographed sword fights and a witty script. The sequel while entertaining on the most part, is definitely inferior in comparison. What I did like about the sequel was the cinematography, it was very handsome like in the first film. The performances from Banderas and Zeta Jones are impressive , not so much the boy who played their son. (can't remember his name). The costumes were lovely The script wasn't too bad, but a little underdeveloped at times. I will confess I was disappointed in the sword fights, they seemed more like slapstick and a little too clumsy to my liking. The main flaw was the plot, it was a very good idea, but it felt rushed, and it felt as though the director was trying to cram too much into a simple storyline. I also wished they made the villains, played adequately by Rufus Sewell and Michael Emerson, more interesting. I liked the music by James Horner, but you do wish sometimes in the more dramatic scenes, that Hans Zimmer would have been a more appropriate choice. Overall, not bad, but doesn't hold a candle to the first film. 6/10 Bethany Cox.",The Legend of Zorro
1,Leofwine_draca,Utter rubbish,2,16 August 2015,"I still remember going to see the first Zorro movie with Antonio Banderas at the cinema. I remember how much I hated it then: all I brought away with me was the image of an irritatingly theatrical Anthony Hopkins in mucho eye makeup. I knew this sequel would be equally as bad, which is why I hadn't watched it until now; I had no idea it would be even worse.Everything about THE LEGEND OF ZORRO screams safe, over-stylised Hollywood film-making. The film adheres to a strict comedy adventure template throughout, with plenty of CGI-enhanced action scenes that never offer anything in the way of real danger or excitement. Instead, these awful fights are like the ones in XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS, designed to fill space rather than say or do anything impressive.A slumming-it Banderas is on poor form here, lacking the smouldering charisma that made him the go-to Latino guy in 1990s cinema. Catherine Zeta Jones is an awful ham and her attempts at fighting are cringe-makingly embarrassing. I felt sorry for Rufus Sewell, the one good actor, stuck in his one-dimensional villain role. The inclusion of a child (Zorro's kid) in the cast is an even worse idea, turning this into a rubbishy MUMMY rip-off with dumb humour throughout. If you like watching nonsensical plots taking place in a make-believe sanitised world then by all means watch THE LEGEND OF ZORRO; if you have any taste as a movie-goer, then I'd recommend avoiding it. At all costs.",The Legend of Zorro
2,SnoopyStyle,Divorce is a tough way to start the movie,5,9 October 2013,"It's the year 1850, and California is about to join the Union. Zorro (Antonio Banderas) has defended the people for 10 years. His wife Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) wants to take some time to travel with their son. Zorro wants to stay to work for the people. She gets a divorce from him. Or is there more to it? Months later, Zorro finds his wife with wealthy nobleman Armand (Rufus Sewell) who owns a vineyard. They were old friends and got reacquainted. Only he's not what he seems.It's a tough way to start the LOVE story of Elena and Zorro with their divorce. It takes the air right out of the movie. It was tough to see them fighting at all. Of course there is no Anthony Hopkins in this one. That makes the couple's chemistry all the more important, and their split the more shattering.The action is swashbuckling as before. But everything is just a little more somber. The humor isn't there any more. It's all rather depressing.",The Legend of Zorro
3,kosmasp,They had fun ...,6,9 July 2007,"... making it. It unfortunately doesn't display that much on screen. There are a few moments that really are funny, but it just never get's really going. A few good ideas include Zorro and his relationship with the horse. Unfortunately his relationship with the character played by Zeta-Jones, doesn't work for almost the complete movie (but when it works, you wish they would have let it work throughout the whole movie), unfortunately.The action scenes/pieces are good (some even spectacular, one involving a horse and a train, and Zorro of course), it's the drama part that doesn't work here. If you're out for mindless fun, without any other requirements, you will enjoy it. But there are better movies out there (e.g. Zorro 1 with Banderas & Zeta-Jones)",The Legend of Zorro
4,classicsoncall,"""Nobody leaves my tequila worm dangling in the wind!""",7,11 April 2019,"Apart from the lavish costuming and splendid cinematography, this film had a fairly by-the-numbers formula harking all the way back to the 'B' Western days of the Thirties and Forties. The masked hero aspect calls to mind The Durango Kid and the suave villain could have been any character actor to go up against the good guy. I couldn't help imagining Zorro (Antonio Banderas) as a Tex-Mex version of Batman, though the character of Zorro was created in 1919 by author Johnston McCulley, while Batman didn't appear on the scene till two decades later in 1939. So maybe you'd say Batman was the American super-hero version of Zorro.With the benefit of hindsight, I guess you could say things never change. Here was a movie made in 2005 about events occurring in 1850, and the premise is that a globalist organization, The Knights of Aragon, is intent on diminishing the status of an emerging America. So with the looming threat of a Civil War, the dashing Count Armand (Rufus Sewell) determines that the best way to affect this plan is to provide the Southern slave states with a means to defeat the North and create chaos throughout the country. Back then, North vs. South, today it's right vs. left. And the beat goes on.You know, as a kid watching television programs back in the Fifties, I can't tell you how many times nitroglycerine was used as a plot device to introduce an element of danger into the story. Mostly in Westerns, and you'd always end up with some 'safe' explosion to close out the story as the hero would save the day. What I couldn't figure out here was why a meticulous tactician like Armand had all those bottles of nitro dangling around in the railroad car in such a way that it wouldn't have taken much to smack into each other to blow the entire enterprise sky high. It wouldn't have taken a train crash to make it happen either.Say, remember when Zorro and Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) crossed swords with McGivens' (Nick Chinlund) thugs. They used their weapons to slash their respective initials on the back side of one of the henchman's underwear. They made it look real 'E-Z'.What gets me is that Zorro's very talented horse Tornado didn't merit a screen credit for his work in the film. He did quite the commendable job, and if he had an agent like Trigger or Champion, his name might be better known today.",The Legend of Zorro
5,jboothmillard,The Legend of Zorro,3,15 April 2008,"I had a feeling that this sequel from the same director Martin Campbell (GoldenEye, Casino Royale) was going to not as good, and it was. To be honest, I wasn't paying the biggest amount of attention to the entire story, but as far as I understood, Alejandro De La Vega (Antonio Banderas), aka Zorro, and his wife Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) has started to drift apart (which they shouldn't be), and she files for divorce. They have a son, Joaquin (Adrian Alonso) who doesn't know Alejandro's secret. Zorro still fights for the freedom of his country, and the new villain to face is Armand (Rufus Sewell), along with his henchmen, including Harrigan (Lost's Michael Emerson). After this I kind of drifted, and was only ""woken"" by the fights, and that finale on the speeding train. Also starring Julio Oscar Mechoso as Frey Felipe, Licence to Kill's Pedro Armendáriz Jr. as Governor Don Pedro Riley, Raúl Méndez as Ferroq, Giovanna Zacarías as Blanca and Nick Chinlund as Jacob McGivens. All the chatty moments are boring and unnecessary, and it is only worth watching for the fights and chases. Adequate!",The Legend of Zorro
6,ma-cortes,Antonio Banderas is appropriately magnificent as Zorro along with gorgeous heroine Catherine Zeta-Jones,6,28 April 2008,"This inferior sequel is a lavish swashbuckler starred by Zorro, as a dashing masked avenger; again Banderas dons a black outfit and becomes the Zorro riding in the hoofprints. This is a zesty recounting of saga of legendary masked rider , though not as distinctive as previous entry, Zorro faces danger from marauding Pinkerton officials as well as corrupt villain. Rufus Sewell as an elegant French villain and leader of knights of Aragon. After numerous setbacks the hero and his lovely heroine, a wonderful Catherine Zeta-Jones, help the good people of California thwart the greedy schemes of a meanie who stands in the way of statehood for the territory. The nimble actor Banderas runs and jumps all over the images of this movie, as he deals with the oppressor with a breathtaking finale over a train and wreak havoc included.In the first Zorro(1998) Antonio Banderas took a chance and jumped from comedy-action to costumed comedy-adventures; and this following he repeats relishing his secret identity with cape and sword; executing bounds and leaps, twists and climbs and throughly enjoys himself. A great casting and an unstopped action keep this picture moving at a rapid clip. Banderas made the character of Zorro his own and quickly established himself as a Latin legend. Antonio Banderas is terrific as the Zorro, well accompanied by ideal heroine, a beautiful Zeta-Jones. Nice secondary cast, such as Shuler Hensley, overacting outrageously as the villain, and repeating actors as Tony Amendola and Pedro Armendariz Jr. Furthermore, overwhelming swordplay and horse action and displays too much of everything. Evocative musical score by James Horner and colorful cinematography by Philippe Rousselot. Another version about this known character created by Johnston McCulley are the following : The mute classic adaptation ¨Mark of Zorro¨(1920, Fred Niblo, with Douglas Fairbanks), the classic ¨Mark of Zorro¨(1940, Robert Mamoulian with Tyrone Power), ¨The mask of Zorro¨(1998, Martin Campbell with Banderas) and European version ¨Zorro¨(1975, Duccio Tessari with Alain Delon).",The Legend of Zorro
7,edwagreen,This Movie Legend of Zorro Could Become Legendary ****,10,12 August 2006,"An excellent sequel to the Antonio Banderas-Catherine Zena Jones original of several years back. Both star again in this action packed adventure.With some historical distortions, the film deals with California becoming a state in 1850 and a secret group ready to foment civil war in the U.S. so that the latter can destroy itself.Zeta-Jones is made to aid the U.S. cause by divorcing her husband and pretending to be the lover of her culprit. Their dejected son proves 100% that he is the chip off the old block.Antonio Banderas breathes new life into the title role. He is funny when he has to be.Even though the writing has taken historical license, just say so what? Sit back and enjoy this entertaining film.",The Legend of Zorro
8,michaelRokeefe,Even a living legend must set priorities.,8,7 February 2006,"Hang on to your hat...Zorro answers the call. Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones command your attention as if you need to be begged. California is on the cusp of statehood and a ruthless gang is hired to keep ballots from getting to the Governor's mansion. Alejandro de la Vega(Bandaras) is torn between being an available husband and father and his call to duty as Zorro. His wife Elena(Zeta-Jones)and young son Joaquin(Adrian Alonso)are reluctantly estranged as 'Poppy is away on business'. Swashbuckling at its best with riveting action from beginning to end. Zorro and the Mrs. are far from being a normal couple with their excellence in sword-play. Banderas is almost faultless in his superior role as the skilled masked crime fighter. Zeta-Jones is nothing less than ravishing. Supporting cast includes: Alberto Reyes, Nick Chinlund, Rufus Sewell and Gustavio Sanchez-Parr.",The Legend of Zorro
9,sunwarrior13,A Lesser Film Compared To The Mask Of Zorro,7,16 October 2012,"The Legend of Zorro is a sequel to The Mask of Zorro and it is directed by Martin Campbell. Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones reprise their roles as the titular hero and his spouse, Eléna, and Rufus Sewell stars as the villain, Count Armand.It's 1850. Don Alejandro de la Vega has become aware of a plot by moneyed Europeans to block the campaign for statehood through nefarious means, and it looks as if Alejandro's heroic alter ego, Zorro, may have to return to duty. However, Alejandro's wife, Elena, has grown weary of his secret life, and she demands that he choose between his family and his clandestine career as a champion of the people. This leads to a rift between Alejandro and Elena, and the couple separates, with Alejandro moving out while Elena continues to care for their son, Joaquin. A few months later, Alejandro finds that Elena is already being wooed by Armand, a suave French nobleman who wants her hand in marriage. However, Alejandro also learns that Armand is actually part of a plot to prevent California from attaining statehood by tampering with an upcoming election; meanwhile, there may be more to Elena's involvement with Armand than romantic courtship. Zorro must come to the rescue of the people of California and perhaps his beloved Elena as well before they both fall into dangerous hands.The Legend of Zorro is a campier sequel, occasionally given too much to childish antics. But once the story really kicks in, it transforms into a fine adventure film and a worthy addition to the Zorro film legacy considering its CG-effects to replicate crowds and buildings, the fake scenery, the flimsy plot and the cheap dialogue all spell a budget- conscious production as well as Catherine Zeta Jones' eminent allure and Antonio Banderas' leading man charm.But overall,this is a lesser film compared to the first Zorro film.",The Legend of Zorro
10,hitchcockthelegend,Prison changes a man.,6,17 July 2011,"The Legend of Zorro is directed by Martin Campbell and is a sequel to the Mask of Zorro from 1998. It stars Antonio Banderas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Rufus Sewell, Michael Emerson and Nick Chinlund. James Horner scores the music and Phil Meheux is the cinematographer. Following on 10 years after the events of the first film, story sees Zorro (Banderas) looking like he is about to lose the love of his wife Elena (Zeta-Jones) as she starts questioning his commitment to her and their young son. With a shifty French aristocrat courting her, and California entering critical political discussions on if it should join the United States? Zorro has his hands full.As any film fan will tell you, sequels to hugely popular movies are notoriously hard to get right. For every great one like Aliens or Godfather II, there are 50 to counter-act them with. Hopes for The Legend of Zorro being great were not high, where even with the publicity junket proclaiming it was to be bigger, more fun and better than the first film, nobody was seriously buying into it. Why? Firstly the gap of seven years wasn't a good sign. Secondly with Anthony Hopkins' character being killed in the first film, there was no chance of that wonderful turn being reprised. Thirdly the presence of a ream of writers involved in this sequel smacked of too many cooks spoiling the broth. As it turns out, the film isn't the stinker it was feared to be, but it still desperately lacks the zip and panache of the 1998 mentor/student take on the masked hero of the people.Action wise, so in turn great stunt work and scene construction, Legend has much to enjoy. From the pulse raising opening as Zorro interrupts the California election, to the high speed steam train finale, film is a popcorn munching crowd pleaser. Problem is, is that in spite of Banderas and Zeta-Jones still sparking, narrative has them drifting away from the character strengths formed in the first film. The potential divorce aspect looks a good (fun) idea on the page, but with offspring sprog Joaquin (Adrian Alonso) grasping too much screen time, the family dynamic irritates where it should instead be moving up a gear. While the multitude of writers have come to the singular conclusion that this Zorro needs to get drunk, mope about and indulge in slapstick more often. Bad call. Still, the villains are strong enough, where Sewell is suitably smarmy and Chinlund dials quickly into the pantomime pulp required for such an action/adventure/comedy plot such as this.Not as funny as it thinks or wants to be, but with such a good helping of action and adventure dotted throughout, film remains above average and worth the time of the undemanding thrill seeker. 6.5/10",The Legend of Zorro

12,Bunuel1976,The Legend Of Zorro **1/2,6,25 February 2006,"My father is a big fan of THE MASK OF ZORRO (1998), particularly its lush score, so this week I rented the sequel for his sake and sat down to watch it with him. As was the case with the 'original', THE LEGEND OF ZORRO is pretty enjoyable in itself and basically a good way to kill off two hours' time after a hard week's work. Still, while the film featured a plethora of lively and spectacular action scenes and elaborate stunt-work, it also suffered considerably from a plot riddled with clichés  outwardly respectable villain hiding a sinister purpose; laconic but deadly manservant (a' la Oddjob); beefy, scripture-quoting thug; a long-suffering but ultimately resourceful priest as a sidekick to Zorro; the latter's unwitting son who worships him while hating his foppish persona  and a script burdened with political (i.e. post-9/11) significance: even while struggling to stay together and unite its various states, America was under attack by a foreign power intent on bringing down its emerging influence. Otherwise, the film keeps afloat by means of star power alone (the subplot involving two mysterious and vaguely sinister blackmailers is redundant in the long run), though its striving for a 'screwball comedy'-type feel in Antonio Banderas' attempts to win back the affections of wife Catherine Zeta-Jones doesn't really workbut some amusement are to be derived from the antics of Zorro's spirited horse!",The Legend of Zorro
13,zardoz-13,Everybody Wants To Be Zorro!,6,19 June 2007,"Hollywood has been making ""Zorro"" movies since Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., originated the 'Robin Hood of California' role in the 1920 silent epic ""The Mark of Zorro,"" based on Illinois-bred crime reporter Johnston McCulley's five-part saga ""The Curse of Capistrano"" that a pulp magazine 'All-Story Weekly' first serialized in 1919. Five years later, Fairbanks encored in ""Don Q, Son of Zorro"" (1925) as both father and son. Since that first ""Zorro"" sequel, approximately 59 other ""Zorro"" epics have thundered across the silver screen. ""GoldenEye"" director Martin Campbell's latest swashbuckler ""The Legend of Zorro"" reunites both Antonio Banderas as the masked avenger and Catherine Zeta-Jones as his radiant wife ten years after their baby son has grown up to become a ""Little Rascals"" type mischief-maker. Unlike its semi-tragic predecessor ""The Mask of Zorro"" (1998) where the real Zorro (Anthony Hopkins) hand-picked his successor before he bit the dust, ""The Legend of Zorro"" shuns any sign of solemnity and stresses clowning at the expense of credibility. Although British-born helmer Campbell stages a variety of outlandish action scenes with supercharged virtuosity, he treats this sequel as a swashbuckling comedy of errors. Not only does Banderas display his customary bravado when he crosses swords with the villains, but also Zeta-Jones shows that she is no slouch when she defends herself. Things get really preposterous when their son Joaquin gets into the act with a sling-shot. Basically, about the only thing that Campbell and writers Robert Orci & Alex Kurtzman of ""The Island"" refrain from doing in this lavish but lengthy 128 minute extravaganza is to allow either Zeta-Jones or Adrian Alonzo as Joaquin impersonate Zorro. For the record, when Republic Studios released ""Zorro's Black Whip"" (1944), a woman donned the mask and cracked the whip, so a precedent had been set for a feminist Zorro.""The Legend of Zorro"" unfolds in the early 1850s when Californians wanted to enter the Union. Unfortunately, anti-Hispanic militant elements try to block the inevitable. The chief instigator against statehood and the equality that Mexicans would acquire under the stars and stripes is Jacob McGivens (Nick Chinlund of ""Con Air""), a homicidal maniac masquerading as a religious fanatic who sports a cross-shaped scar. Zorro (Antonio Banderas of ""Desperado"") thwarts McGivens when the unsavory ruffian steals the ballot box in the first scene. No other action scene quite matches the energy level of this dazzling set piece until the scenes aboard the train transporting nitro-glycerin near the end. Moreover, the opening scene serves to assimilate Hispanics into not only the movie but also into American society. Afterward, Elena and Don Diego quarrel. Now, Diego must relinquish the mask, because he had promised Elena a decade ago that he would settle down as a husband and father. Naturally, you can't keep a stalwart defender of social injustice down, and Diego storms off in a huff. Meanwhile, a pair of Pinkerton agents (think of them as 1850's Homeland Security) discovers Zorro's hidden identity, and they blackmail Elena into divorcing him, so she can romance foppish vineyard owner Count Armand (Rufus Sewell of ""Dark City"") and expose this European aristocrat as an anarchist who works for a secret global ring of terrorists called One World Government. Simultaneously, in one of the most absurd anachronisms in any big, dumb, loud action movie, dandified Armand collaborates with secessionist elements within the U.S. Army led by Colonel Beauregard (Leo Burmester of ""Passion Fish"") who represents what he calls 'the Confederate states.' Anybody that knows anything about the American Civil War knows that the Confederacy didn't rear their heads until the 1860s. Moreover, another obvious anachronism is Armand's hidden map of 1850's America that features all 48 continental states! Anyway, Armand and his henchmen are cooking up a devious plan to destroy the statehood initiative with an ingredient in soap that serves as a bomb. When Zorro and Elena aren't at loggerheads, son Joaquin tries to right all wrongs by imitating Zorro. Of course, little Joaquin doesn't have a clue about Zorro's real identity, so he spouts nothing but contempt for his father.Banderas and Zeta-Jones rekindle their charismatic chemistry as husband and wife, but you can never take them seriously. Between the terrific introductory set-piece and the exciting but unbelievable finale on a runaway train, ""The Legend of Zorro"" degenerates into a half-witted, convoluted comedy. At one point, our jealous hero gets himself drunk after he spots Elena dancing with Armand. When we see him next, Don Diego sets slumped astride his stallion Tornado, with the animal itself leaning drunkenly against the wall in a pose straight out of the classic 1965 western farce ""Cat Ballou."" Rufus Sewell's urbane Count Armand is no match for Zorro's adversary in the 1998 Zorro movie, but Nick Chinlund's fiendish henchman McGivens steals the show with his comic antics. His comeuppance would have been more effective had he been treated with greater ambiguity. Altogether, despite some superb stunts and a little bit of everything for all ages, the PG-rated ""The Legend of Zorro"" resembles the ""Spy Kids"" franchise that Banderas starred in for director Robert Rodriguez. Audiences that love buffoonish action movies with loads of tongue-in-cheek humor will enjoy this Zorro saga. If you prefer Zorro played without laughs, however, you should skip it.",The Legend of Zorro

Laughable plot regards the split between Zorro wife because he won't hang up his mask. When America needs help then he must go back on his word. Screenplay has all the excitement of horse sh*t with Zorro suddenly popping up every time someone farts. Director Martin Campbell returns but relies mainly on production. He had much greater success with The Mask of Zorro. What happened when he made this pathetic sequel remains a mystery. Antonio Banderas does his best as Zorro but he is mainly there for the action and not as engaging as he was in the previous film. Catherine Zeta-Jones is embarrassing particular in her action scenes. Rufus Sewell plays the moron villain out to become the latest bad guy to cause destruction and wasted screen time. However, the most embarrassing performance is Zorro's son, played by Adrian Alonso who takes after his father when it comes to crime fighting.

16,gradyharp,Tongue in Cheek Adventure Sequel,8,2 February 2006,"Unlike many of the inevitable sequels that follow popular expensive movies, THE LEGEND OF ZORRO is happily a lot of fun to watch. Though overlong in excess of two hours, and though the story line is pushed beyond tolerable limits, it is easy to forgive the many weaknesses of the film and just enjoy the verbal and physical jousting between Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones.The story this time 'round concerns the broken promise Alejandro de la Vega (Banderas) made to his wife Elena (Zeta-Jones) at their marriage ten years ago: Alejandro would give up his dangerous life as the masked Zorro. But the upcoming opportunity of statehood for California is at stake and so, of course, the five bells ring and Zorro is on his faithful steed Tornado to right the wrongs. Elena informs him that if he goes on another mission, he may as well not come home, despite the fact that they now have a son Joaquin (Adrian Alonso). But Zorro rides and gradually we discover the covert underpinnings of the cause to which Zorro is called. There is a newcomer in town, one Frenchman Armand (Rufus Sewell) who is mysteriously tied to the worst of all possible deeds with the aid of the smarmy Jacob McGivens (Nick Chinlund).... Elena, no slouch of a wimpy wife, joins in the action in a wily way, and ultimately with the help of good priests Brother Ignacio (Alberto Reyes) and especially Frey Felipe (Julio Oscar Mechoso) good triumphs over evil (surprise!).There are some well staged duels and fighting episodes and some tender moments about family, especially father/son repartee, but the ingredient that makes these Zorro films work is the fact that Banderas and Zeta-Jones look like their have such a good time. There are many hilarious lines in the most unexpected places. No, this is not a great movie, and despite the fact that yet another sequel is probably planned, enough is enough. But it is entertaining in its lighthearted way. Grady Harp, February 06",The Legend of Zorro
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Legend of Zorro,7,26 October 2005,"Finally, after 7 years since the last Hollywood Zorro movie hit the big screen, director Martin Campbell is back with his original cast of Antonio Banderas in the title role, and Catherine Zeta Jones as his wife Elena de la Vega. Set 10 years after the last movie, The Legend of Zorro wastes no time in plunging the audience thick into trademarked action pieces that many associate with the Spanish Fox - the acrobatic lunges, flips, swordfights, whip action and horseback riding.It's all familiar territory with the romanticized Old California, now at a crossroads where the state is in decision to join the rest of America. Things have changed for the de la Vega family too, as they have a new addition to the family, a son named Joaquin, who takes on traits of his father, but not knowing his father's secret identity.Naturally, family takes the central theme in this movie. Why do vigilantes wear masks - simply to protect their loved ones as they enroll in the crusade for justice. This film explores the dilemma of the avenger as he struggles to be there for the general public in their hour of need, and the balance of spending enough quality time with his own family.Relationships aren't rosy with husband and wife, and it's no surprise, they bicker again on screen. And when this concealment and protection of identity is compromised, what could be exploited from it? Plenty of action in this movie to keep Zorro fans happy, and it's a marked improvement from the predecessor too. Zorro moves with guile and swift agility that will raise your eyebrow at the style of his acrobats, befitting his name ""the fox"". The use of the whip has increased, and so is the intensity of the swordfights.However, the plot might be a bit of a letdown. It's the usual James Bondish storyline of some Euro-knight baddie in some highly secret underground organization trying to achieve the total destruction of America. One forgot to remind him that he'll need a lot more smarter accomplices in order to fulfill his desire for world domination. With 4 writers credited for the story, it does seem convoluted somewhat to include too many scenes which clocked the movie slightly longer than 2 hours. Some comedy was injected, but those with Tornado seemed a bit contrived (a horse that smokes and drinks? Come on...) The pacing too is somewhat erratic, dragging some scenes unnecessarily and introducing subplots that in my opinion, went against the motivation of characters. There's a stab at the high-handed tactics of a certain government agency, and it's like watching a precursor of spy-versus-spy games. The soundtrack seemed to rehash the love them from the earlier movie too, playing it each time Elenor comes on screen, and the camera still soft-focuses her a lot too.But what could have been given longer screen time is the on-screen banter between Banderas and Zeta Jones. That was what made the first film likable and popular, and while this movie had flashes and moments of it, we could have had more. One could have also expected the effects to be seamless given today's technology, and nothing new presented on screen, but while the end result was impressive, there are certain frames that were obviously blue-screened and superimposed.Despite its drawbacks, this is still a worthy Zorro movie, and with the signature shot of Zorro on Tornado hoisting its legs high in the sky in an all-ready posture ready to strike, with sword drawn, all can be forgiven.",The Legend of Zorro
18,SimonJack,Theme change does this film in,4,6 January 2017,"As so often happens with sequels of movies, this one falls far short of the 1998 film, ""The Mask of Zorro."" That was a reincarnation of the mythical character of Old California created by author Johnston McCulley (1883-1958). Since the first silent film, ""The Mark of Zorro"" that starred Douglas Fairbanks, Hollywood made at least one Zorro film every decade until this film in 2005.While this film keeps the same male and female leads as the 1998 film, it makes major story changes. The female lead is now the wife of Zorro (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones), who provides some of the swashbuckling. I can appreciate Hollywood going with the times and making films since the late 20th century about women in various adventurous, daring and female macho roles. We have had women heroes of derring-do as well as male from comic book stories (Superman, Superwoman, Batman, Batwoman, etc.). And, Hollywood creates an occasional new super-athletic female ""fighting machine"" of its own, as ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,"" played by Angelina Jolie. Those are fantasy fiction characters and stories, as are those with such male roles. But in ""The Legend of Zorro,"" the female swashbuckler is a fantasy within a mythical story, or legend. The plot has a whole new look, and one that gets far-removed from the time the story is supposed to take place. Now, a fiery, sword-wielding female hardly needs the protection of a man. Indeed, she can save him. So, this film has sort of a role reversal and that plays against the aura and the mystic of the time, in Old California. It can't make up in other ways what it loses by this wholesale change of theme. So, this one doesn't work at all. Beyond some of the action that is fun to watch for how it is staged, there is very little to recommend this film.",The Legend of Zorro
19,JamesHitchcock,Spot the Goof,6,9 November 2005,"The character of Zorro, as originally conceived, was a sort of Robin Hood of Spanish-ruled California, but this film updates the story to a setting more familiar to American audiences, the Old West. The year is 1850, the date of California's admission to the Union as a free state, something that has caused consternation in the slave states of the South. Zorro is still righting wrongs, fighting injustice and combating those Southern sympathisers who are attempting to sabotage the ballot on the State constitution. Zorro's activities, however, have not impressed his beautiful wife Elena, who thinks that he is neglecting her and their young son Joaquin. Elena divorces Zorro and gets engaged to an old flame, a French Count named Armand, despite the fact that he is an obvious cad. Indeed, Armand is something worse than a cad; he is a member of a ruthless secret society which already controls Europe and is attempting to destroy the United States. Armand is part of a conspiracy to produce nitroglycerine on his California estate and to ship it by train to the Confederate Army in the South who will use it in a surprise attack on Washington.It is obvious from the above synopsis that this is not the sort of film that places a high premium on historical accuracy. One can amuse oneself while watching it by playing ""spot the goof"". There was no transcontinental railway joining California to the Eastern states until 1869. Although some in the Southern states were already discussing the possibility of secession in 1850, there was no Confederacy, and no Confederate Army, until 1861. Nitroglycerine did exist in 1850 (it had been discovered in 1846) but it was regarded as too dangerously unstable to be of any military value. We see Abraham Lincoln at the California statehood ceremonies, at a time when he would still have been working as a lawyer in Illinois. (The President at the time was Millard Fillmore). We see a map showing the twentieth-century political boundaries of the American states. The Catholic Church condones divorce and remarriage. The name ""Armand"" is occasionally pronounced as ""Amande"" (a feminine name in French). The Spanish word ""constitucion"" is seen misspelled in the English way as ""constitution"".Much of this historical inaccuracy is probably deliberate. Even though none of the three leading actors are actually American, the film's politics are quite defiantly nationalistic; America's westward expansion into previously Mexican territory is presented as part of the march of freedom, and the fight against slavery is brought in as part of this general theme. (President Fillmore does not have the same standing as an icon of freedom as does Lincoln). The main villain is a decadent European aristocrat; ten years ago he would probably have been an Englishman, but the French now seem to have usurped Britain's Least Favoured Nation status in Hollywood. Another recent film, ""The Brothers Grimm"", also has a French villain; France's stance on the Iraq war may be to blame. The motto of Armand's secret society, ""Orbis Unum"" or ""One World"", may be a covert reference to the UN, an organisation which features in many American conspiracy theories. (This is not, incidentally, the first Hollywood film in recent years to project modern America's fears of foreign conspiracies back into the nineteenth century; there was a rather similar plot line in ""Wild Wild West"").Despite its questionable politics, there are some enjoyable things about this film. Catherine Zeta Jones, one of the most beautiful actresses working in the cinema at present, has never looked lovelier than she did in the original Zorro film, ""The Mask of Zorro"", and her beauty has not diminished in the intervening seven years. Antonio Banderas makes a convincingly dashing action hero, ably assisted in his swashbuckling heroics by both Ms Jones herself and Adrian Alonso as Joaquin. This is a family-values thriller; as in ""The Mummy Returns"" the hero is helped in his struggle by his wife (played in both cases by a beautiful British brunette, Rachel Weisz in the earlier film) and their cheeky but lovable young son. The action sequences are generally well done, and there is an amusingly detestable comic villain in Nick Chinlund's McGivens. Nevertheless, the film often lacks the freshness and vitality of its predecessor. I hope that this sequel will be the last; any attempt at making this into a lengthy series would, I feel, be subject to the law of diminishing returns which normally afflicts such franchises. 6/10",The Legend of Zorro
20,Smells_Like_Cheese,"It started out as an awesome sequel, but then became very predictable and it lost some spice",5,28 November 2006,"I was looking forward to The Legend of Zorro after being very happy with The Mask of Zorro, I have also been falling more and more in love with Antonio Bandares lately. He and Catherine had the greatest chemistry in the first Zorro movie, but it turned into a Mummy's Return kind of romance, where it just fizzled out and seemed to have not as much chemistry as the first.Zorro is back with his love Elena, but she is fed up with him and wants a divorce since he keeps flaking out on his promises of quitting his job and staying with her and their son, Joquien. He barely knows his family, therefore Elena demands a divorce. She moves onto a count, but it turns out that this count wants to destroy and make California his state and not a state of freedom. Zorro must defend the state and win back his family, but can he do it all at the same time? The Legend of Zorro has some fun humor and great action sequences here and there, but it is the story that fizzles out and it just seemed like everyone lost their edge.

There is enough comedy to make you smile. Trouble is it has all been done before & even better in some cases. Antonio Bandaras & Catherine Zeta-Jones do fine together but the script appears to tell me that the franchise is getting a little worn. If they are to continue these, a fresh approach is needed, something UN-expected to turn on the audience. Yes, than can continue to crank these out, but to make something outstanding, a new approach is needed. Still this is not a bad film to sit back & enjoy as it has action, lust & heroes enough to make most happy, just not thrilled. As usual, the good guys win.",The Legend of Zorro
22,Rainey-Dawn,Action Packed,8,17 October 2014,"I think this follow-up film (The Legend of Zorro) is just as good as the first flick. Unlike some of the other critics, I personally feel that this movie maintains it's Hispanic-Western aura to the film. The romance between Zorro and Elena is not lost. The addition of their son, Joaquin, to the story added the extra zest to the film. This movie is much less comical more drama driven.I do recommend this movie to any one that likes Zorro, Swashbucklers or Western Fantasy films. I personally believe one should watch the first movie ""The Mask of Zorro"" then follow it up with this film: ""The Legend of Zorro"".8.5/10",The Legend of Zorro

But there are certain parties who try to force the people to vote one particular way. Never fear, Zorro's here, swinging in to swash-buckle the villains in his own unique way. But all this crime-fighting is taking a toll on his marriage to the beautiful Elena, as well as his effectiveness as a father to his increasingly precocious bratty son Joaquin (Adrian Alonso) who seems to be picking up a few of his absent dad's tricks, which he uses to his own effect. Elena has had enough, moves out and takes up with Armand (Rufus Sewell) a typically dastardly French count who's not all he seems. But then, neither is anything else.This belated (nothing new there, then) sequel to the highly enjoyable 1998 original adaptation of Zorro retains the original's main stars, Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta Jones, as well as the same director, Martin Campbell. The sweeping, stirring score of the original film remains, and there's also a pleasing twist in the plot that makes it not just a basic one. But a clichéd, plodding story that's going nowhere, and a (possibly subsequent) tendency to drag on make this an inevitably less enjoyable experience than the last film. It's still fairly good fun, though and in a pleasingly different league to a lot of the films out today. ***",The Legend of Zorro
24,MLDinTN,not very exciting,5,15 August 2006,"The movie was OK, but it just didn't seem to be that original. Maybe it's been to long since the first one came out. It's an adventure/action film, but they decided to force comedy. It didn't work. I mean a horse catching a pipe thrown off a balcony and smoking it. Come On! There weren't many sword fights and nothing new. This time Zorro and Elena have a kid, who is more of an acrobat. At least they made the villain French. The story tried to reinvent history, by giving the south a reason it didn't win the Civil War.Also, even though no blood is shown, I thought it was a little gruesome because quite a few people get blown up - one guy even is at the front of a train collision. Just because it doesn't show body parts flying around, doesn't mean it's not gross.FINAL VERDICT: Too violent for young kids. It was decent but I wouldn't pay to watch it.",The Legend of Zorro

Eventually Zorro finds that his wife, Elena is dating a mysterious French guy. Now Zorro has to solve two mysteries deeper and darker than anyone would have imagined. The beginning is great. It's similar to the Mask of Zorro. The action, swordplay, and stunts were amazing. The acting by Banderas and Zeta-Jones is great. They did not skip a beat since the first film. I even liked the little mischievous kid. He cracked me up. Finally, James Horners delivers another majestic score. My only negative thought is that this movie should be rated PG-13, not PG. I rate this movie 9/10.",The Legend of Zorro
26,callanvass,About on par with the 1st if you ask me. it's agreeable entertainment I suppose.,6,15 December 2009,"I didn't have high hopes for this one after being severely disappointed by the 1st,but much to my surprise it managed to be quite watchable and fairly entertaining as well. It's more action orientated and while Mask Of Zorro was better made technically,I actually found The Legend Of Zorro to be a little more entertaining. This is Antonio Banderas's film and this time he thrives on the challenge,giving all of Zorro the key components he needs to be an entertaining hero,and I really think the film benefited from this. The Script does have a few minor holes..example Catharine said in the 1st she didn't care about money,yet this time she does??..it makes her character look completely pompous. The film does have a main problem though and that's Rufus Sewell. He's much too bland for a villain,and the worst thing is he does it all completely straight,so the film really sags whenever he's on screen,not to mention all the bickering between Catharine and Banders does get old after a while. The better pacing,better action sequences and overall enjoyment made me appreciate this sequel more even if the 1st was better made.The Performances. Antonio Banderas unlike the 1st he is fabulous here!. His character is much more refined now with the acting chops and a true sense of Heroisim to be the perfect Zorro.He never completely convinced me in the 1st movie,he was always charming but he never felt like an action hero,it's a much different story here.He is the heart of the film and Antonio thrives on it,the only beef I have is his chemistry with Catharine seems forced. Catherine Zeta-Jones is OK here. She just seems to be going through the motions, with an irritating character to boot. Her charisma with Anotonio is off,however it's not all her fault due to some of the script's inadequacies of her character. Adrian Alonso is a lot better then most kid actor's and pulls out a few fun scenes,but most of the time he acts with his scowl. Rufus Sewell is devoid of any charm what so ever,he's completely bland and charm free,the movie dragged when he was on screen and brought the overall quality of the movie down. Nick Chinlund is a very good character actor,here he played a very amusing henchman..loved him!. Julio Oscar Mechoso is the comic relief,but a very likable one at that,a priest surprisingly too.Bottom Line-I rather enjoyed it,it's about on par technically with the 1st,but more enjoyable if you ask me. I was quite pleased with how this sequel progressed,and unfortunately due to the box office failure this film was,I don't think will see a number 3 anytime soon. Worth the watch.6/10",The Legend of Zorro

By the end, the stereotypicertaining But Not Great",6,23 January 2019,"5 November 2005. It's hard to compromise - this sequel attempts to push a feminine agenda onto Zorro with mixed results. By the end, the stereotypical conclusion wins out again. This predictable adventure movie has its convoluted plot and a decent dose of marital spats as well as sword scenes where Zorro is able to win over his foes in a less than fatal way, in most cases. The cinematography and photography are great, lavish, the music swoons with strong, epic strains of music. The marital discord in this movie takes the place of the Zorro transformation and tutoring session from the original movie. The comical scenes are edited in with flare and a number of cute scenes add a little spice to an otherwise typical adventure movie.It's too bad that the movie couldn't have pushed the envelope more in its substance and develop the characters even further. The son becomes the usual stereotypical hyperactive child of parents in conflict. Even the somewhat confusing emphasis on the strong Mexican population in support of American statehood, the apparently questionable federal agents all make for an uneasy undertone in this movie - who are the really the good people in this movie anyway, a similar question that was raised in the original movie.",The Legend of Zorro

31,jimbo-53-186511,A misjudged and misfiring sequel,4,2 April 2020,"Don Alejandro de la vega (Antonio Banderas) at the behest of his wife Elena de vega (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is asked to hang up his mask once and for all and start behaving like a father to his son rather than continue to be his masked avenger/alter ego Zorro. Zorro's arrogance push his wife over the edge and into the arms of another man French Aristocrat and megalomaniac Count Armand (Rufus Sewell). Worse still, Armand is not only rich, but dangerous, and a dastardly plan that he has in mind could have catastrophic consequences to the United States unless Zorro can stop him...The Legend Of Zorro has the same director and some of the same writers from the original film and given how good the original film was this surely should have worked, but the honest truth is that it doesn't work anywhere near as well (which is odd given it has retained many of the key people who made the original such a success)I think part of the problem with this sequel lies with its rather overambitious plotting; the original film was a fairly straight-forward revenge based swashbuckler (whose simplicity was its key strength). The Legend Of Zorro tries to cram a lot more into the narrative; father/son relation strains, marital strains, Zorro's identity crisis etc. There are other elements which I won't reveal as I don't want to spoil any more of the story, but all of these things work against the film for 2 reasons; 1) They take a lot of the fun out of the film and 2) They make the film feel unfocused. I will admit that everything does come together in the end, but the question you have to ask yourself is would you rather watch a film like the first film that is exciting with a tightly-focused revenge-themed plot or a sequel that gets bogged down in trying to half-heartedly develop relations, romances and characters with a cheery sidearm of 'saving the country.' I know which approach I prefer, but you can make your mind up for yourselves.A few other things that feel notably absent here is a sense of thrill and excitement; the original film suffered from weak storytelling, but it made up for it by being cheeky, fun and thrilling. If this sequel was on a temperature scale it would struggle to reach Tepid. There's nowhere near as much swashbuckling, it isn't nearly as much fun as the original (the only parts of the film that had me laughing were the scenes with Banderas and his horse, but even these scenes weakened as the film progressed). There's a dreadful soap-opera element between Banderas and Zeta-Jones - necessary to the plot perhaps, but a lot of the time it was still quite annoying and the kid who played their son was also very hit-and-miss.Still I have to concede that the finale was well-staged and quite exciting and Banderas is definitely at his best when he is donning the mask (he isn't the best of actors and struggles when depth and emotion are called upon). Not an awful film by any means, but the overstuffed plot results in a film that runs far too long with many a dull stretch encountered along the way.",The Legend of Zorro

The movies plot starts to picks up when Elena is confronted by two men who want to hire her to go undercover as Rufus Sewell's girlfriend in order to find out what he's up to. The acting in the film is good, I really enjoyed Catherine and Antonio's performances, they go from lovers to hating to joining together to save their son, stop Sewell, and kick some ass in the meantime. Speaking of ass kicking, the fighting and the action sequences are very well done, they aren't terribly rough or bloody but they are very intense and all over the place. And let me just say that I personally think that Catherine Zeta Jones can kick some villain ass a lot better than Antonio Banderas lol, get it girl. That's another good thing about the film, strong female empowerment and good examples of a woman taking charge and fighting for herself. It also shows good family love, so it's for sure a good pick for a family to view with children in late elementary or middle school.

34,rbverhoef,A little disappointing,6,2 November 2005,"'The Mask of Zorro' from 1998 was charming, funny, contained some great action scenes and showed us a chemistry between Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, an actress not that well known back then. Now that movie has a sequel, 'The Legend of Zorro'. It is much less charming, is only remotely funny, has greater but also less plausible action scenes and separates Banderas and Zeta-Jones, now one of the leading ladies in Hollywood and an Oscar-winner. On the bright side, they do have a kid together, Joaquin (Adrian Alonso), who is too smart and knows too much about fighting, but is one of the nice things in this movie.So the story deals with the separation of Banderas, who of course is Zorro, and Zeta-Jones, who is Elena, their kid who hardly sees his father although he sees enough of Zorro (strange that a kid that smart does not recognize his own father behind a mask), some villains including McGivens (Nick Chinlund) and Armand (Rufus Sewell), who happens to be dating (if that is the word) Elena. Why they are villains I leave for you to discover although it is not that important anyway. They have to be there for the action scenes and that Elena is seeing one of them is a plot device to give us some twists and turns. The problem is that even those twists and turns are as predictable as they can be, making sure we do not really care about the story.There are some things that save this movie though. The action scenes are not plausible but they entertain and at least the sword fights are not completely edited away. There is some real choreography here. Banderas still makes a nice hero, Zeta-Jones still is a nice leading lady, it is just too bad they are not the team they are supposed to be. Also the jokes have their moments although they seem misplaced. Zorro's horse is turned into his sidekick and although it gives us laughs, the scenes around him are really only there for the laughs.In the end 'The Legend of Zorro' feels like a disappointment because it is compared to 'The Mask of Zorro'. If this was the first movie I think I would have liked it a lot more and was just hoping for a better sequel. Now this is the sequel, which is entertaining enough, but that is the best I can say.",The Legend of Zorro

Elena then files for a divorce and hooks up with an old flame from France (played to sinister perfection by British Hottie Rufus Sewell), too bad he is a terrorist hellbent on destroying America before it becomes a super power.

36,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Good But Misses The Mark,8,6 January 2012,"When watching the first Zorro film, I felt like I was watching The Three Musketeers (1993). Swords swishing, clanging, and their wielder's jumping and ducking. This sequel has that too if not more. All of this was great to watch but what made the first one better was with a helpful performance by Anthony Hopkins. With Hopkin's character being a mentor it really brought in the idea of the next Zorro to fill in the boots. Much of it was very noble and understanding. As for this film there were parts of this film that were too childish for the franchise.Antonio Banderas stars once more as Zorro, the sword-wielding revolutionary. It's a delight to see Banderas play Zorro once more because he played his part really well in the first film. Catherine Zeta-Jones also comes back for another round and this time she uses the sword just as much as Zorro did in the first one. It's nice to see some mutual cooperation when it comes to husband and wife fighting off a group of bad guys. Playing as their son is Adrian Alonso who does a good job at speaking English because before the film was made, he had no idea how to. If this film were to have a sequel I would hope to see Alonso play the upcoming Zorro. Even though he is not Banderas' son, he shows all the same qualities in the character he does Zorro and that's a good sign. But I don't think that'll happen anytime soon. The only thing I thought seemed out of place in this film was the main source of the plot. For almost two thirds of the film, Jones and Banderas argue as parents (which is normal) about their relationship with their son and the Zorro business. That part isn't normal obviously but it's like every minute the two stars meet up with each other they argue. How childish can this get? At first their son is uncontrollable and the marital relationship seemed to be diminishing and it creates a very negative tone. However, there are some parts that do have some comedy put inside of it but it's doesn't occur very often. It's like this film was destined to end with a divorce. I'm glad it didn't end that way, though it does go out with a bang, which was nice to see.As for the action, the sword fights, and on the brink of death moments are numerous if not more than the last film. The Mask of Zorro (1998) was more about discovering what Zorro was like and how he would transform into that character. This one is out of control and expanding boundaries but in good way. Action sequences vary from saving people from burning buildings, messing around with C4 explosives or swashbuckling on a runaway locomotive. Sounds intense if you ask me. The music was composed once again by James Horner who also did the first film. Horner keeps the music energetic and cultural to the story's background, which I feel is partially essential to a movie's success. Nothing sounds different from the first soundtrack, which is good, because the good things should be left untampered with.Despite the fact that for the majority of the film, Banderas and Jones argue like children, the film amounts to a decent sequel. The action is fun, and the music is enjoyable.",The Legend of Zorro

An overdone, overlong and emasculated pale imitation of the first movie.The action is just plain ridiculous. In fact, it insults your intelligence. Wagons careen through streets on two-wheels, horses leap from bridges onto moving trains and Zorro himself becomes more acrobatic than Jet Li and Jackie Chan rolled into one. It's just plain dumb.

In short, LOZ is a horrible follow-up to Mask of Zorro. It may have the same setting, characters and even actors. But it's just a horrible mess. that is a shadow of the first movie. Plus, it commits the cardinal sin of any movie - it introduces a child for the sole purpose of irritating adults and making kids like the movie.In keeping with this more kid-friendly abomination, LOZ features very few deaths. Sure, the lead bad guys all buy the farm, but their minions uniformly fail to be killed by Zorro, leading to the logical conclusion that either a) Zorro is useless, or b) the movie is hideously PC. As a result of this ""nice, less gory"" Zorro, the movie lacks any punch or real drama. It becomes what it is - a pointless action movie with no surprises and little thought required.And don't get me started on the horse jokes. ""Idiot"" doesn't begin to describe whoever wrote those scenes.Just who are these movies aimed at? Anyone who is either educated, of average or above intelligence or who has any real world experience whatsoever, must surely find these films patronizing and insulting.

This time, he fights against evil-doers with the help of his beautiful wife, Elena, and their precocious young son, Joaquin. Alejandro De LaVega is torn between two worlds: his life as Zorro and his life as a family man. After Alejandro once again breaks his promise to stop wearing the mask, Elena leaves him, and soon begins seeing Armand, a haughty French Count. But a mysterious explosion in the desert leads Zorro to believe that there's more to Armand than meets the eye, and our hero is intent on finding out what that is. Little does he know, there are others working to uncover certain truths as well.I dreaded to see this movie once the critics panned it. Sometimes I think ""judge the movie for yourself"" and sometimes ""listen to the critics"" and I picked with ""listen to the critics"". Yes, I bought this in the 99 cents store because I really don't want to spend much more on DVD for it.Have I ever liked for a Zorro movie to be a movie for the kids to enjoy? No. Did I like it when this movie went to that direction? No. This movie felt like a children's movie with the stupid jokes and visual gags and the movie felt silly and not to be taken seriously.Having said that, this movie is more light hearted than the first film. It has more humor and wit, although there were some dumb jokes. Ironically, the action is more intense in here and it felt like a real action movie. It was really well done. The sets (or scenery) are fantastic and the choreography for the swashbuckling action was great.Still, there comes a price. I really did not want the kid character to be in it or that this was more directed to the kids to enjoy rather than a real PG-13 action film, like the first. Elena, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, was way different than the character we've seen her in the previous film. Still, I liked her feistiness.Antonio Banderas' performance, although more childish, was good, as well as Catherine Zeta-Jones' performance. Rufus Sewell's performance as a villain was decent, all though not that great or evil enough.If you don't mind a family movie, watch this with your kids. If you're expecting more of a mature movie, like the first movie, then you'll be disappointed, although the action is better. This film is just plain silly and cannot be taken seriously. For me, I thought it was decent enough to recommend it.",The Legend of Zorro
39,MR_Heraclius,Zorro,6,6 March 2020,"Considering that the first one was absolutely terrific in delivering top notch action and delivering a solid story, this sequel is surprisingly average. The film has the feel and good ideas of the first, but the film mostly feels strained and forced. The film is still an entertaining film but its also disappointing in the fact that the first one was so good. I thought The Legend Of Zorro delivered average action and an average plot, I felt that there was nothing special about the film. The film feels like they're trying to outdo the first one which of course was great. This sequel is at times silly and really doesn't live up to the original. Overall the film is bordeline good fun, it's nothing truly excellent or good. The film is average. I found the acting to be quite sloppy too. The kid annoyed me and he was probably written into the script to give the film a ""needed"" edge that almost every sequel needs, a kid that gets himself into a shitload of trouble for the sake of putting the main characters at risk. This is too bad, because The Legend Of Zorro could have been something truly terrific, but the end results is that of a strained sequel that tries to overdue it's predecessor. The Legend Of Zorro will disappoint fans of the first, and some will think that this is an average or mediocre film with a watered down plot. Borderline decent, but not good or great at all. I was disappointed.",The Legend of Zorro
40,Cosmoeticadotcom,Not good,5,19 September 2008,"The Mask Of Zorro was a 1998 sleeper hit, directed by Martin Campbell, that saw Antonio Banderas in the role he was born to play, that of the 19th Century Mexican-American superhero Zorro, aka Don Alejandro de la Vega. The film was notable for two other reasons- first, it was a very good film, even considering it was in the action-superhero vein, and two, it was America's introduction to the almost flawlessly gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones, a co-winner of the female genetic perfection sweepstakes, along with Halle Berry.Since that film, Jones has become a household name with her films, marriage to Michael Douglas, and an Oscar nomination. The rest of the Zorro crowd has not fared as well, and this 2005 sequel, The Legend Of Zorro, set a decade after the first film, is only a so-so follow up.If only the film had taken more advantage of the seven year hiatus. After all, it's not like they rushed a sequel into production. Yet, that's exactly what this film feels like, despite its good fun. Overall, I can give this film a marginal recommendation, especially as family fare, but I suspect that there will be no more sequels, at least not with Banderas and Jones, in this franchise's future.",The Legend of Zorro
41,mstomaso,"Zorro and Family - Fun and Entertaining, but it's definitely a sequel",6,2 September 2007,"The wonderful Catherine Zeta Jones and Antonio Banderas reprise their roles as Elena and Zorro and are joined by their characters' son Joaquin (Adrian Alonso) in this fast-paced adventure set at the time of California's incipient state-hood. Alejandro's heroism is destroying his family in more ways than one, and the very fabric of 19th century Californian society is also being challenged by a threat of organized terrorism. Zorro, his wife and child must all pool their resources to fight threats to their family and their homeland.If this sounds like heavy stuff, don't be fooled, this is a lighter film, which feels a bit more like Shanghai Noon than the original Zorro. The stunt-work and sword-fighting are entertaining, over-the-top and not to be taken seriously.Martin Campbell, who appears to have matured into a very competent studio director (despite some questionable early efforts) does a very nice job with the directing,and the cinematography and editing are fine. The acting is all good - across the board. And if you happen to rent the DVD, you will definitely enjoy the extras which are nearly as fun as the movie itself.The film's greatest weakness is, not surprisingly, its script. Like most WGA scripts, the script comes across as having been written by committee, in an ad-hoc manner, and without much forethought or a central premise. The dialog is sometimes very weak, and the film is driven less by exposition and plot than audiovisual momentum. If not for the cinematography, acting talent, directing, and editing, this could have been a total wash-out.Recommended for fans of the original who can keep their expectations in check, and light action fans.",The Legend of Zorro
42,Victor Field,"Too much buckle, not enough swash.",5,17 November 2005,"One of my favourite entries in Roger Ebert's book of movie clichés states that any movie with the word ""legend"" in the title will fail to live up to its title; ""The Legend of Zorro,"" though not a stinker, pretty much follows that rule to the letter.This way-too-belated sequel to ""The Mask of Zorro"" brings back Antonio Banderas, Catherine Zeta-Jones and director Martin Campbell, but forgets to bring along the passion, high spirit and sense of adventure that made the first movie such fun; Zorro may now be a husband and father, but it's not the presence of the kid that makes the movie a disappointment. In fact, young Joaquin is so spirited that ""The Legend of Zorro"" might have benefited from being a look at Zorro third generation, since the man in the mask didn't start protecting fellow Californians until he was an adult - following the boy on an adventure, stuff like that. (That his action scenes are actually MORE exciting than his dad's reinforces this impression.) Unfortunately scriptwriters Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci fluff the movie by awkwardly blending domestic problems - even unto divorce! - with what's basically a spy plot involving smoothie Rufus Sewell, making the movie sometimes seem like a bad episode of ""Alias"" minus Jennifer Garner (especially in an extended sequence with Mr. and ex-Mrs. Zorro sneaking around at Sewell's house, and in the climax on a runaway train). The movie might have helped from Kurtzman and Orci pretending they were back writing for said show or even ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"" and gone for broke, but they don't; it's pretty unexciting for most of the time, and while the movie's sense of humour is a help sometimes, more often it just causes groans.SPOILER FOR THE CLIMAX.And as for the train finale, while FX Luddites may be pleased to see the train is a miniature rather than CGI, in this day and age there is no excuse for its fiery demise (complete with that of the villain) to be so obviously a miniature. Even if it is by WETA's Richard Taylor. (And hands up anyone who predicted that CZJ would make a joke about ""The drinks are on me"" - the evil scheme involves nitroglycerin in wine bottles.) END OF SPOILER.Zorro's son and the monk who plays Alfred to Zorro's Batman enliven the movie, and Antonio Banderas also gives more than he gets - but while it's ultimately an okay way to kill two hours, when it's over nothing sticks in your mind the way Zorro singlehandedly wiping out a group of men on horseback in the first movie does. Where there was spirit and a desire to pass on the torch, now there's squabbling. Ironically, it fits that ""The Legend of Zorro,"" like the first movie, was executive produced by Steven Spielberg - it spends too much time Amblin for its own good.",The Legend of Zorro
43,vitaleralphlouis,High Quality Remake of Zorro Rates Your Attention,8,12 February 2006,"We skipped this picture in theaters primarily because the preview makes the film appear to be an exercise in the Attention Deficit Disorder genre of today's Bad Movies. With the snow coming, I rented the video as a desperation choice. What we got for our $2.75 was an outstanding remake of The Mark of Zorro, a fast moving adventure film that never lets the viewer down, and offers positive values of religion, patriotism, courage, tenacity, and the value of the family. Antonio Bandaras doesn't simply stand tall in Tyrone Power's shadow, rather he seems born to play the role of Zorro. The film also raises the question: Who is Martin Campbell? 2005 was a year that brought out the worst of Hollywood, and a well earned decline in box office. No picture released in 2005 deserves more condemnation than Peter Jackson's $150 to $200 million trashing of the all-time great adventure movie King Kong. In Peter Jackson's inept hands, we got a movie that began its box office death after just two weeks. By the third week -- obviously word-of-mouth matters a lot --- the multiplexes were moving Jackson's limp gorilla from the bigger auditoriums to the broom-closets. The 1933 King Kong endured for 70 years, but Jackson's picture didn't survive 7 weeks. Peter Jackson is the worst director in movies, Martin Campbell is one of the best. Why does everyone know Jackson's name, but nobody knows Campbell?",The Legend of Zorro
44,juliankennedy23,A litany of complaints about various things in this overstuffed two-hour long movie.,4,22 April 2019,"The Legend of Zorro (2005) 4 out of 10: The sequel to the well-received The Mask of Zorro is a disappointment. One might argue it borders on the outright bad. Let's see if we can find out why. Or at the very least we can put on paper a litany of complaints about various things in this overstuffed two-hour long movie.The Good: There are two great performances in this film - Julio Oscar Mechoso as the tough Padre Frey Felipe and Catherine Zeta-Jones as Zorro's wife. Catherine Zita-Jones doesn't look a day older than she did in the first film and still does excellent work with her fight choreography and acting. The late Julio Oscar Mechoso humanizes his character of the monk teacher who takes care of Zorro's son, and he has a gentle, quiet toughness to him.The movie lights up whenever these two actors are on the screen.There are also some great action scenes in the film. Not nearly enough however for a movie that is over two hours long and feels like four but welcomed still the same.The Bad: Unfortunately, for The Legend of Zorro, Catherine Zeta-Jones not aging makes Antonio Banderas look even that much older. Antonio is too old to play Zorro in this film. He looks tired, puffy, a bit sick. Forget believing Antonio is backflipping off of buildings. Antonio seems as if a fifty-yard sprint would wind him. He reminds one of Roger Moore in (well any of the James Bond movies now I think about it) but unlike Bond, Zorro is a swashbuckler, and that is a fit man's game if not a young man's game.Rufus Sewell as the bad guy in this film is all wrong. Weak, sniveling with a bad guy plan that looks as if it escaped from the Wild Wild West script. Sewell is a European aristocrat who is a member of a secret organization of well other European aristocrats who are afraid of America and as a result, want to prevent California from joining the Union.We will get to the history in a minute but Sewell is the kind of villain who has a giant lair complete with a snake strangling the world statue and he is having a meeting with all his European counterparts (How they got to California is again a mystery we will get to), and Sewell gives them his diabolical plan, and one of the compatriots says this is madness I will have nothing to do with this. This is of course followed by the obligatory I told you my secret plan, and you announced you are against me, but you are free to leave. Sewell then throws a bottle of Nitroglycerin (Again we will get to the history stuff in a minute) at the man's feet killing him but not blowing up his secret lair or hurting anyone else. Yeah, he is that kind of villain.Oh, and Sewell has Zorro tied up with a knife at this throat but decides not to kill him after all because Catherine Zeta-Jones asked him not to. This is understandable in a Catherine Zita-Jones could talk me into anything kind of way, but Sewell is still too stupid to live.The Ugly: A history lesson: Yes once again I realize that its a movie, not a history lesson but the movement away for anything resembling the reality of the time did hurt my enjoyment of the film. Plus if I call out the history, it will prevent me from going down that rabbit hole where I speculate how the hell are we supposed to buy Adrian Alonso the biological kid of Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones. I mean know I already went down that rabbit hole before with my review of Skyscraper, and I hardly want this to be my thing. But I don't know; maybe the kid was adopted by the nice white couple after a dinosaur ate his drunk dad as in The Beast of Hollow Mountain? Or perhaps the producers realising they were making a movie about Mexican American's fighting Confederates, (Confederates in California??? I know I know I am going to get to the history in a minute) and that it might be helpful to have a least one Mexican American among the main cast surprisingly stacked with Welsh people? (Catherine Zeta-Jones and our villain Rufus Sewell.)Where was I? Oh yes, history. Okay here is the basic plot (or plots). Catherine Zeta-Jones is being blackmailed by the Pinkertons to divorce Zorro and take up with our villain Rufus Sewell who is trying to prevent the vote for California statehood as part of his diabolical plan to weaken the United States. He teems up with the Confederacy promising them nitroglycerin in exchange for allowing them to run native Mexican Americans off their farmland for the new railroad.Okay, gold was found in California in January 1848. California stopped being Mexico about ten minutes later in February 1848, and the population exploded. The Compromise of 1850 is how California became a state. There was no vote in California and because of the gold rush America had no idea how many people there even were in the state. The Compromise of 1850 is something one learns in school with all the black and white sketches of Henry Clay and Stephen Douglas. It is one of the most famous pieces of legislation from the 19th century. So we can quickly establish that 1850 is when this movie takes place, and there was no actual vote for statehood. (California was under a Military Governorship and was an occupied territory.)Here are the various things that did not exist in 1850. Confederate soldiers, railroads in California, a way to get to California that wasn't five months long or filled with peril, Pinkertons, and Abraham Lincoln; (Well Abraham Lincoln did exist as he was a legislator in Illinois at the time, I am referring to the Abraham Lincoln who was at a non-existent signing ceremony celebrating a non-existent vote while on a non-existent railroad and being threatened by a non-existent train filled with more nitroglycerin than probably existed in the world at that time.)In Conclusion: All the complaints above really wouldn't matter if the movie didn't feel twice the length that it was and lead Zorro, Antonio Banderas didn't look like he was recovering from a particularly nasty bout of malaria. What a difference seven years makes.",The Legend of Zorro
45,russem31,What happened?,5,26 December 2005,"After the spectacular success (both box office and critical) for the first film, The Mask of Zorro, I was very much looking forward to this long-awaited sequel. Considering the fact that it took the filmmakers 7 years to get this one, The Legend of Zorro, off the ground, you would assume that the script would have been perfected, since both Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones decided to reprise their roles. And the score by James Horner is EXACTLY the same score as the first film - since I loved the first film score this one is great but repetitious (there isn't even any new musical themes!). I just hope if they actually do another Zorro, they respect the spirit of the first film. An average 5 out of 10.",The Legend of Zorro
46,Hayden-86055,Fun and flashy action film,8,15 January 2021,"Legend of Zorro is not as good as Mask of Zorro, that much is certain. What does need to be said however is that it's still a lot better than most films and has a lot going for it. The action is stylish and well shot and the acting is very good, Rufus Sewell is fantastic as the villainous Count Armand and Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are great as ever. Also notable is Nick Chinlund playing a sort of ultra religious and violent murderer, sort of comparable to Captain Love in the first one but less charming and more physical.The music deserves high praise and I would say is just as good if not better than Mask of Zorro and cinematography wise it is excellent, the end scene with the train chase is one of the best produced finales I've seen in recent years and is very exciting.The characters are well developed here, especially the further changes to Alejandro and Elena's relationship, and Joaquin as their child who plays a big role. Count Armand is definitely an interesting character as well, and a very very good villain, not one dimensional at all.8/10: Doesn't have as good a story as the first one, but there's an undeniable energy and has great action sequences and characters",The Legend of Zorro
47,Carycomic,Viva El Zorro!,9,2 November 2005,"As with ""the Mask of Zorro,"" there is a mixture of real history and ""reel"" history, in this sequel. In the first movie, Don Rafael plotted to take control of California during Mexico's war with the United States. Yet, that war wasn't fought until 1846. And, MOZ was set exactly two decades after California became a _Mexican_ colony (circa 1822)!In this movie, McGibbons--a racist American religious fanatic--wields a Henry repeating rifle. That brand of firearm did not exist until 1864! Prior to that, lever-action rifles were manufactured by the Volcanic Arms Company. And, they were nowhere near as dependable as the Colt-made revolving rifles that were a little more prevalent back then. Plus, the American characters keep referring to the Confederate States Army. The latter did not exist prior to 1861! In 1850, all the southern U.S. had was individual state militias.Those minor complaints aside, this movie is one of those rare exceptions to the general rule about sequels being inferior to the original films. Antonio Banderas is still in fine form as Alejandro/Zorro, and Catherine Zeta-Jones is still as beautiful, intelligent, and feisty as the first time she played the Princess Leia-like Dona Elena. None-the-less, there have been changes. First of all, they changed their surnames to De La Vega, in honor of Elena's birth-father. *Alejandro having been the younger brother of Joaquin Murietta, an actual californio Robin Hood.* Secondly, they have a nine-year old son who is becoming increasingly rebellious in his parochial school. And, Elena resents the fact that Alejandro spends more time helping everyone else but them! This is brought to a head when McGibbons tries to steal the votes that would ensure the American territory of California enters the Union as a free (=non-slave) state. It makes Alejandro reconsider his promise to retire from swashbuckling. It also allows two Pinkerton detectives to discover his dual identity. They are not out to arrest him, however. They are spying on a secret society called the Knights of Aragon (modeled after the Illuminati of urban legend). And, the fact that its leader--masterfully played by Jude Law look-alike, Rufus Sewell--is an old flame of Elena's persuades them to recruit her help. They do so by exploiting her feministic resentment towards Alejandro.What follows is an almost-flawless mix of romantic comedy, father/son angst, quasi-historical intrigue, and sword-fighting/whip-cracking adventure that I will most likely sit through a second time, this coming weekend. That's how much I enjoyed it, the first time. VIVA EL ZORRO! P.S.---the scene where Tornado leans against the wall is an homage to that classic Western-spoof, ""Cat Ballou"" (w/Jane Fonda and Lee Marvin).",The Legend of Zorro
48,DonFishies,"Boring, and not on the same wavelength as the original.",6,17 February 2006,"Another movie that was just plain boring. Yes, it has the humor of the original, and the chemistry between Antonio and Catherine. But it doesn't have a whole lot of anything more. Antonio is looked over again, and much of the film is made up more of supporting performances, as opposed to his own (much like Once Upon a Time in Mexico). We understand that they are trying to give him more time to be more of the man that is Zorro, as opposed to just Zorro, but there is too little influence on him either way until the finale.And again, the movie studio is trying to make a role for Catherine Zeta-Jones that she can't do. Other than be a damsel in distress/hot eye-candy, Catherine Zeta-Jones is not really any sort of actor. She won an Oscar for Chicago that she only got because she married Michael Douglas, and has yet to prove her worth in any film asking her to be more than just a supporter of the supporting character.As well, the kid was just annoying in this movie. He loves Zorro, so he tries to act like Zorro, and therefore his father, Zorro, must save him every 20 minutes. Tired formula just gets worse as it keeps going on.And did this movie really need to go on for more than 2 hours? They spend too much time on the useless Jones subplot, and the ""You can't be Zorro"" subplot, that when the actual good parts come, they quickly disappear moments into them. All that's left are numerous moments of boredom, that could have easily been wiped away with a better editor and a much more polished screenplay.Cut a hefty 20 minutes out, and maybe give Jones something to do, as opposed to something to try and do, and maybe it would have worked and not just been a bust.But then again, did we need another Zorro movie?6/10.",The Legend of Zorro

On top of that, he has to deal with an international secret society, and its plot against the United States. ""The Legend of Zorro"" does not quite live up to its predecessor.

50,Flagrant-Baronessa,"Even as an easily digestible PG adventure, this could at least have had some brains",2,12 July 2006,"The Legend of Zorro (2005) is completely uninvolving from start to finish and the only thing that could have saved such a poor story and performances is some well-placed humour. Unfortunately, there is not a single joke that you haven't seen or heard before, and they are all so cheap and immature that I cringe just remembering them. There is also not a single line that hasn't been done to death and not a single action sequence that isn't clichéd or uninteresting.Even the disappointing opening scene made my heart sink. Probably because it features the typical young boy with an awe-struck face at seeing Zorro. There is nothing new at all - it's like the filmmakers weren't even trying. All the while you have this hammy score playing on in the background, so blatantly cheering on Zorro's action with musical crescendos. Antonio Banderas as Zorro and Catherine Zeta-Jones as his increasingly rebellious wife still have great on-screen chemistry and they look exactly the same as they did in the first movie seven years ago. That is quite the feat but none of this matters because it's such a terrible, terrible film.",The Legend of Zorro
51,diac228,If only it was Robert Rodriguez directing this flick,5,21 November 2005,"Back in 1998, The Mask of Zorro brought back the famed masked hero to the big screen, and became a modest hit. Featuring the decent actor Antonio Banderas, Hannibal (Anthony Hopkins) and also the drop-dead gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones, The Mask of Zorro was a forgettable yet enjoyable movie that paved the way for other action-packed movies with tons of adventure and swordplay, like The Mummy and also Pirates of the Caribbean. But, for whatever the reason a sequel was nowhere in sight for a very long time, and then suddenly appears in the most inopportune of times. This time, appearing with a PG rating and also with a different cast of writers, The Legend of Zorro seemed like it was aiming towards a different audience. While in some cases this is a bad thing, do recall that Zorro was always more of an adventure for families to see, the Disney version of Zorro was very clean even though it had plenty of moments for swordplay and humor. Then again, this is Hollywood, so a PG movie usually means a mindless action film that throws in a bit of lowbrow humor for the kids. The last time there was an action PG film that was nearly perfectly crafted was the Pixar smash The Incredibles. The Legend of Zorro is way too long, clocking in at past 2 hours when it easily could have been a 90-minute film. The movie drags on way too long, and despite the well-done action sequences, the movie will leave you disappointed. The thrill and magic and even humor of it was totally gone, and for a PG movie, this film was pretty rough. The plot is not only rather mindless, but also happens to be almost more historically inaccurate than The Babe (Babe Ruth was batting the wrong way during the entire film), released over a decade ago. Just know that Zorro and his wife are going through some problems, and also California is fighting to become a U.S. state. In the meantime, Zorro (known to the public as Alejandro) is also trying to bond with his son, who is rather feisty and mischievous. A few twists and turns later, it is then realized that there are some people who do not want California to become a state, and as a matter of fact they want the entire country to be ruined. Sounds like ruthless villains, but it is rather easy to figure out who are going to be the bad guys. The plot is the main reason as to why the movie is so mediocre. The writers clearly did not know what material to put in between the major scenes of the film. At least in the original there was a good dance sequence and some clever dialogue inside the church. In this one there is nothing but boring fluff. The one-liners are gone, and so is a little of the romantic tension between Banderas and Zeta-Jones. Not saying that they did a bad job acting-wise, but the plot forced the two to separate, only to try to relive that tension that worked so well in Mask of Zorro. Zeta-Jones continues to shine as she remains as one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, hands-down. The second time around, you get to see her fight even more, even though you do not see her lose all her shirt because of Zorro. How disappointing, er, I mean, anyways, Banderas also does a superb job as Zorro who is indecisive about his secret life and his family life. Adrian Alonso comes off as sometimes funny, sometimes annoying, and overall just a distraction from the focus of the film, which should be Zorro. That child has quite a career ahead of him, but I did not like the way he was used in the film, he was nothing more than entertainment for the kids watching Legend of Zorro. Legend of Zorro is action-packed; never mind the PG-rating. While the amount of action is a little less than one would hope, the scenes are full of fights, swordplay, cool moves, over-the-top stunts, and the occasional bit of humor. This film could have easily landed the PG-13 rating, but somehow it remained in PG territory. I guess it was a near-nude Catherine Zeta-Jones scene away from garnishing the rating that has worked so well this year (examples: Harry Potter, Star Wars III, War of the Worlds). The action scenes keep you on the edge of your seat, but when it is all over, you will go back to your sleeping position and wait for the next exciting moment to kick in. For a movie that is over two hours long, there is very little content in it. Bottom Line: Quite frankly, Legend of Zorro is meh. The decent fights and climactic moments are barred by pointless scene after pointless scene of boring dialogue and sad attempts at humor. While the acting is superb, the plot and screenplay pretty much strips away from what could have been a superior sequel. It would be a blast for some people, but seeing that it could have been so much shorter and so much better, I couldn't help but be a little disappointed. Legend of Zorro was passed on by Robert Rodriguez, one can only imagine how much shorter and how much better it could have been if it was the popular Mexican director behind the camera. If a third one is coming out, then Campbell should watch Desperado and take notes. Legend of Zorro: Too long, yet not enough fun.5/10",The Legend of Zorro
52,christian123,It's not an Oscar quality film but it could make for a fun night at the movies,5,6 November 2005,"Antonio Banderas is back under the mask of Zorro, the 19th Century swashbuckler who must face another dangerous mission, although he promised his wife Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) that he'd give up his life of adventure for a quiet family life as Alejandro de la Vega. But those who opposed California becoming a state in the Union are planning a new threat that might change their plans.The Mask Of Zorro was a pretty good film. The sequel isn't as good yet it's still enjoyable. I personally would rather have the PG-13 rating but surprisingly the sequel didn't actually suck. I have to give credit to the cast and director. Martin Campbell knows how to direct action and he made this film very entertaining to watch. The story is a little weak and there isn't really anything new to found here but the action makes up for that.The acting is solid just like the first one. Antonio Banderas takes the role of Zorro again and he does a good job. Catherine Zeta Jones returns as Elena and she also does a pretty good job. These two have a lot of chemistry together and they are interesting to watch on screen. The new addition to the cast and the person who almost ruined the film is Adrian Alonso. He plays Joaquin, the son of Zorro and Elena. He has a few funny lines but for the most part, he is really annoying. His role should have been cut since he almost ruined the entire movie.Many people are complaining that the new rating kills the film and I disagree. The fight scenes are tamer and safer when compared to the original. He actually doesn't really use his sword to kill nor is much blood shown. However, the fight scenes are still pretty good and there are a lot of entertaining scenes like the train scene at the end. There were some boring scenes but they didn't last long. Also, the film is really cheesy and some of this does get annoying, nothing too major though. In the end, if you expect something like the original movie than you will end up disappointed. However, if you want something in the vein of National Treasure, a safe family action film, then this sequel is for you and it can really be enjoyed by adults too. Rating 6/10",The Legend of Zorro
53,theshadow908,Not exactly a legend.,6,13 January 2006,"The Legend of Zorro is a very entertaining film. It's lots of fun, and it has lots of action. The aspect of Don Diego struggling with his dual life is pretty cool.This movie is about Zorro, who now has a son, and his ongoing battle to keep California safe. His wife Elena ends up leaving him because of his dual life, and she starts dating a French aristocrat. Zorro knows in his gut that this man is rotten, and sure enough, he finds out that this man has invented a new explosive called nitroglycerin. Zorro now must fight him for California, and for the love of his life.The acting in Legend of Zorro is just as good as in the first one, but it's the characters I'm worried about. I think Elena gets to involved with the action in this one. Plus, the addition of Zorro's rebellious son was a mistake. The mini-me version of Zorro is ridiculous. I have the same complaint for the little kid in The Mummy Returns. It really annoys people who want to see an action film.The story of this film isn't as great as the first one either, but it still makes for some okay popcorn entertainment.6/10",The Legend of Zorro
54,JoshtheGiant,What a Bad Movie,2,17 February 2006,"Why does Hollywood feel obliged to remake every masterpiece and make a sequel for every film that made over a hundred million dollars? The Mask of Zorro which is one of the best action films of the nineties and loads of fun really didn't need a sequel. If they had come up with a good story for it that might have worked but instead they made The Legend of Zorro. The Legend of Zorro is a horrible film, particularly in the plot/screenplay category. Nothing is explained so nothing makes any sense. For instance the film takes place in 1890, but they keep talking about the civil war that America is fighting. Who the heck wrote this? There are many other major flaws that I will not mention now. The film is also horribly directed and acted, it is hard to believe it is still the same Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta Jones. What a horrible movie, one of the worst of the year.",The Legend of Zorro

CZJ is as stunning as ever, as well as a kick-ass heroine in her own right, and Rufus Sewell makes a fairly convincing villain (tho' I prefer him in his positive leading roles), while Adrián Alonso is very cute. Unfortunately, Antônio Banderas and, particularly, his horse, are the roles where the film overdoes the silly gags. And that doesn't sit well with the tragic bits.",The Legend of Zorro
56,jace_the_film_guy,Cartoonish and Cheap,3,14 September 2021,"Such a disappointment. As a fan of The Mask of Zorro, I was expecting the same level of thrill and intrigue. Unfortunately, The Legend of Zorro felt like a watered-down version of its predecessor. I do not know if it was because the studio was aiming for a PG rating or something more family-friendly, but the result was too cartoonish and cheap.The dialogue was overacted, performances were overdramatic and most of the scenes could have been picked out of a daily soap opera. The addition of the child was unnecessary, annoying, and distracted from the other characters. Ultimately, there was nothing special about The Legend of Zorro, which is disappointing because of the greatness of the first film.",The Legend of Zorro
57,bob-rutzel,Great Entertainment,7,2 February 2006,"When we last saw Zorro (Banderas) he had beaten back the bad guys and was going to concentrate on his family, as he just had a son. Now, ten years later, we see him divorced from Elena (Zeta-Jones) and the kid Joaquin (Alonso) is always told his father is away on business. So he has his hands full and still has to deal with a Spanish Count (Sewell) who is driven to destroy the United States. This at a time when California is striving for statehood.This is still great fun. Yes, a little hokey, but we need hokey from time to time. Yet, the acting and dialogue are good. The stunts are done by real people and are spectacular. This movie still tries to inject humor where it can although I think the Mask of Zorro had more good one-liners. One of the best lines in this movie is when Zorro hops on Tornado, with the box containing the voting results, and says: let's go to the governor's mansion. The great horse stays put. Again, Zorro says it. Tornado again stays put. Then Zorro says it in Spanish and Tornado takes off like a shot and Zorro says to the horse: we have to work on your English.I know this is a period piece, but Catherine had too many clothes on her. It was like she didn't know what to wear and just pulled the nearest drapes all over her leaving the required cleavage for viewing, of course. But, we didn't come to this movie to see a clothes horse. She didn't have to have that amount of clothes on her. She was lost in those drapes. We came to see a hot (yes, she is still hot) Catherine Zeta-Jones. Something could have been done. What were they thinking? Historical accuracy? From what I have seen in movies regarding real events in history, there is no such thing as historical accuracy. So Mr. Director, we don't need to see our Catherine looking like she is taking the neighborhood's drapes to the dry-cleaners. Keep that in mind for Zorro 3 when the kid is trained to be the new Zorro. No, she still won't be too old then.All in all, this is good fun and I do hope they make a Zorro 3.",The Legend of Zorro

We know that Catherine Zeta-Jones is pretty/useless but at least she appeared to be enjoying herself in the original... maybe because she was actually given something to do back then. Here she drifts through the entire film with nothing but a nice frock and a disapproving look. I'll be generous and assume that chief villain Rufus Sewell's perpetual sneer is probably for the screenwriter.The few set-pieces would look hokey in the vintage Zorro TV series, but spread as thinly as they are over two hours and separated by over-egged, repetitive dialogue, they offer meagre pickings to the action-starved.On this evidence, it looks as though Martin Campbell will be the director to finally put Bond to the sword with Casino Royale (since director Lee Tamahori added to the embarrassment of Die Another Day with his cross-dressing antics).

Finding himself torn between life as a family man and his protégé Zorro, Alejandro must choose his path or let his path be set for him.I can understand the idea of making The Legend of Zorro a family film, but the PG fight scenes and crappy humor take the idea way too far. That's right; this action film was given a PG rating. That alone should help audiences know that the movie is going to be total garbage. ""Legend"" is not nearly as clever, exciting, or amusing as the predecessor and lacks everything a god action film needs and instead relies entirely on a plot that makes very little sense. Antonio Banderas finds himself in the worst role of his career and Catherine Zeta Jones finds her acting to be consistently crappy. But let me tell you about the little kid. That little kid is the most annoying kid in the whole entire world. When he said ""you want a piece of me?"" while fighting two grown men, I almost punched the person sitting in front of me. It made me that mad that people laughed at such filth.

61,MovieZoo,Parting is much sweeter than Zorro,6,28 October 2005,"When I saw the first trailer, I knew Zorro was going to be in trouble. It was clear his enemies were hiding behind the cameras. If only there had been a Tornado to blow away those enemies.I really want to say, ""go see this movie if you only want to see some adventure, any adventure"" but I can't. Yes there is some adventure. It was fun to watch Zorro do his job. But I found myself wanting to get pleasing scenes back that were yanked away by converting serious moments into scene-killing comic relief. One touching, romantic scene was making me feel all soft and warm, when all of a sudden, the two adults became more like Homer and Marge Simpson. Sorry Homer and Marge, I still love you. There were too many mundane morphing scenes. As a result the movie became the same. It showed promise at various points only to become something less. I think the film makers believed they were adding comic relief but instead came up with comic distress.This is not a movie for the seasoned Zorro fan or the fan who still craves swashbuckling, romance, thrills on the big screen and comedy between scenes(as opposed to adding comedy to serious moments in a scene).Nick Chinlund, Banderas, Catherine Zeta Jones and Alonso did their jobs well, considering what they were given. Tornado is a beautiful horse but he should stick to his day job and avoid being a comic or a sidekick(straight-horse as it were).Still, I give it a fair 6 out of 10.",The Legend of Zorro
62,pzanardo,Nice blend of comedy and adventure,7,11 December 2006,"I did not like the first Zorro-movie with Banderas, namely ""The mask of Zorro"". Strangely enough, its sequel ""The legend of Zorro"" is, in my opinion, a much better and thoroughly enjoyable movie. The main original and pleasant idea in this new Zorro-film is to show the hero facing not only the usual legions of bad guys, but also the family troubles that bother the average modern man. You know, he has no time to stay with his kid, to take him at school, and so on. His (adorable) wife Elena gets annoyed since he's never at home and neglects his family, and the fact that Zorro's job as a legendary hero is very demanding is not a sufficient justification for her. Actually, shortly after the beginning of the story, Elena abandons Zorro and asks for a divorce! (we are informed that something peculiar is going on, though). To see Zorro in these irksome common-life circumstances is really very funny, and the comedy avails of a brilliant script, as well.Nicely blended with the comedy, we have a well-written adventure story. Of course, there is plenty of spectacular, totally unrealistic action (even too much) and of great stunts and special effects. Graphic violence and atrocities, that at times marred the first Zorro-movie with Banderas, here are virtually non-existent. A very good idea, in my opinion.Banderas as Zorro makes an accurate job, and he is extremely nice and admirable for self- irony. The supporting cast works very well, although the bad guys sometimes are a bit over- the-top, even for this kind of movie.Catherine Zeta-Jones is the major fringe benefit of this nice movie. Of course, she acts well, and she is lively, funny and determined as Elena, a character as central as Zorro is. But, well, let me make some comments on her amazingly wonderful beauty. Zeta-Jones is by far the most beautiful actress in the world. But to overwhelm other current actresses is an even too easy task for Catherine. There is much more. Actually, she stands on a par with the legendary beauties of the Golden Age of cinema of the 1940s and early 1950s, with Ava Gardner, Ingrid Bergman, Rita Hayworth, Jane Greer, Grace Kelly, Frances Farmer, Marilyn Monroe and all the other goddesses of beauty. I even dare say that Catherine is enough close to the top one, the divine Gene Tierney. She is a real joy for the eyes of the viewer. A minor flaw of the script is the use of a too modern language, especially when the characters keep saying ""I can't believe it... Can you believe it?""""The legend of Zorro"" is a recommendable movie, very entertaining and funny, accurately made and sometimes even brilliant. Moreover, we gentlemen have got Catherine Zeta- Jones... and, well, there is also Antonio Banderas, in case the ladies are interested.",The Legend of Zorro
63,leilapostgrad,Austin Movie Show review (a Taco Bell of a movie),3,30 October 2005,"I'm not an expert on California history, but I doubt it was as peachy and patriotic as The Legend of Zorro makes it out to be. It's 1850, and the people of California are voting on whether or not to join the Union, and everyone is unconditionally thrilled about being Americans and finally being free. Yeah right. The Legend of Zorro depicts 19th century Hispanic culture in much the same way that Taco Bell depicts Mexican food  both are cheap, bland, watered-down versions intended to be easily consumable for American audiences.In all fairness, it is a cinematically well shot movie with a couple fun fight scenes, but it's got no depth or edge to it at all. It panders for the cheap laugh by having a horse that drinks and smokes. Hahaha. Oh, and how lame is this  the bad guy is actually out to take over the world!!! Wow!!! No villain has tried to hatch such a diabolical scheme since Pinky and the Brain! The Legend of Zorro is lame in every way, but undoubtedly, 10-year-old kids will absolutely relish seeing this movie with their parents. They are the only people I can recommend this movie too (because, let's be honest, they don't have high cinematic standards at that age).",The Legend of Zorro

But this time, the world has changed. California is no longer part of Mexico and is becoming a state of the Union. Zorro must do what he can to insure the safety and freedom of the people.This is an action-packed film for the whole family. This is not a history lesson; this movie takes a lot of liberty with historical facts. Beyond that, it is a really fun movie. Granted, it is a little over the top with some of the action. But, I think that is more for the kids to enjoy. I would say it is a combination of 'Spy Kids' and 'The Musketeer' (not as over the top as 'The Musketeer').I thought Adrian Alonso (Joaquin) did a particularly good job as Don Alejandro's son. I thought he was the same kid who played opposite Antonio Banderas in 'Four Rooms', but he is not. Nevertheless, he is really good. So is Rufus Sewell (Armand) as the villain. People may remember him from 'Dark City'.",The Legend of Zorro
65,TexasRedge,Zorro part 2 ...not bad ...but not as good as the 1998 original,5,26 February 2007,"I absolutely loved the original movie ""Mask of Zorro"" that came out in 1998. and I could wait to see this one. I did find it rather odd that it took them 7 years to make a sequel...but none the less they finally made it.The good news is that they didn't try rehash the first film all over again with bigger special effects and slightly different circumstances(like many sequels do..example: Die Hard 2) The Bad news is that is cannot hold a candle to the 1998 original. This movie is no where near as good as the first one.Once again, just like with the first film,the music score is great, the actors are perfect for their roles, the scenery is beautiful and the stunts, special effects & action sequences are great.(the first movie got all of those same elements right too)But this movie unlike the first movie, the story isn't as good. at most times the plot is very predictable. However I felt like the writers tried to hard to work in way too much comic relief, and it bogged the story down. The story takes a long time to develop, and when it does finally develop, everything happens pretty much they way you already knew it would.overall its not a bad movie, and it does have its moments. but there is way too much comic relief, and the story moves way too slow.... it is an 5 out of 10. It worth watching once.And if you've not seen the first one...do yourself a favor and watch it",The Legend of Zorro
66,irish23,Better-than average sequel; not-so-great film,4,13 April 2008,"I had low expectations watching the sequel to the outstanding original Banderas-Hopkins- Zeta-Jones film, and ended up surprised. Most sequels are so appallingly bad it makes one wonder why they were made. This is decent for a sequel, creating a new story but using the same characters.The problem is that the new story isn't nearly as interesting as the original, and that the filmmakers made the regrettable decision to make this a ""family"" movie. Which, for some mysterious reason known only to Hollywood, means the inclusion of bathroom humor. The previous film had dignity, style, and a moral core. This just has style.It also seems jarringly out-of-time. So much of the set looks like the Old West, which means gunslingers. So why is everyone fighting with swords? Especially when the bad guys use guns on everyone but Zorro? It's a weird mishmash that doesn't quite work.The intensity and focus of the original is missing from this picture, but I'm sure it would appeal to kids and others who like relatively straightforward action films.",The Legend of Zorro
67,mercury4,"Not as good as the first one, but still good",10,6 November 2005,"I just want to start off by saying that The Legend of Zorro is not as good as The Mask of Zorro. But I don't think it is supposed to be. Usually the first is always the best anyway.The beginning is similar to the first Zorro. There's a lot of commotion and Zorro gets there to save the day with the people cheering him on. After California is finished with there election, goons show up to steal the ballot box. The bad guys are led by a creepy looking guy with wooden teeth. Zorro does not take long at all to swing right into action and neither does this movie. When Alejandro gets home he is urged by his wife to give up being Zorro. He tells Elena that the people still need Zorro. Elena tells him that he still needs Zorro. From the start you could tell that Alejandro is going to have to make a choice. Alejandro refuses to give up being Zorro and he is sent divorce papers later on. Alejandro turns into a depressed and lost drunk. Elena ends up with a French aristocrat Armand, played by villain regular Rufus Sewell. Armand is Alejandro's rival, but he turns out to also be a dangerous rival for Zorro. Armand has more dangerous plans than simply wooing Elena. It doesn't take long before Alejandro discovers this. Alejandro realizes that he must pick himself back up and stop Armand. He must also get his family back. His wife left him and his son, who he hardly sees, is slipping away with her.I enjoyed this movie very much. I especially enjoyed the climactic train fight. I liked the part when Zorro tells Armand that no matter where he goes, the world is not big enough for him to hide from him. I also liked how Abraham Lincoln shows up in the end when California is joining the Union. That was a nice touch. I really don't understand why a lot of people talk so bad about The Legend of Zorro. Many reviews I read in the papers gave this movie a mere 1 star. After seeing the movie I was shocked. The Legend of Zorro is a lot better than it gets credit for. It was action packed and there were many exciting stunts. The Legend of Zorro is also a good movie in how it shows you to never forget who you are. Maybe this movie is not as good as The Mask of Zorro, but that does not make it a terrible movie. The Legend of Zorro has a lot of silliness. There are a lot of things that you see that can only happen in the movies, but hey, you know what they say, ""anything can happen in the movies."" This also does not make The Legend of Zorro a bad movie. I can't understand why people complain about the performances. Antonio Banderas, of course, was good as Zorro, Catherine Zeta-Jones was good, no surprise. Even Adrian Alonso was good as their little son Joaquin. Nick Chinlund and Rufus Sewell also do their part as the villains of the movie. Sewell may not be a Basil Rathbone, but he was still a good villain. Sewell even played a believable Frenchman. I really had no problem with any of the actors.Instead of listening to negative reviews, go out and see this movie for yourself. Maybe you will enjoy it just as much as I did. If you enjoyed The Mask of Zorro then check this movie out. If you enjoyed The Mark of Zorro with Tyrone Power, then check this out. If you enjoy a good action movie or just a nice family movie, then check this out. Believe me, you won't be disappointed.",The Legend of Zorro
68,emdoub,"Swap your brains for popcorn, and you can have fun with this.",4,29 July 2006,"Okay - the acting was good, the cinematography just fine, and there are some truly fun moments - it's not all bad.It will help a *lot* if you can make your brain quit working while you're watching this - because the script/production was apparently aimed at the brainless.Spoilers are unavoidable if I'm going to give examples.Okay - the people of California, the territory, think of statehood as ""freedom"". This statehood is opposed by the Confederate States (about 10 years before they exist) because it'll put non-slave-holding states into a majority, even though states were admitted into the union in slave/non-slave pairs, to avoid just that. (Never mind the irony of the time-traveling CSA opposing California in gaining freedom by becoming a state, when what the actual CSA wanted was freedom from being a state).A Catholic couple gets a divorce (in under 3 months) because she claims he's not enough of a family man.The Truly Evil henchman quotes the bible, and claims to be bringing ""The Lord's"" retribution.The Pinkertons were a federal agency, showing the worst of traits attributed to modern federal agents. Yet they could, outside of their jurisdiction, chase a woman through a Spanish-heritage village with nobody interfering, place a man in local jail because he was inconvenient, and use homing pigeons to communicate with a covert operative. (Homing pigeons only go home - and home (or a pigeon in a cage, waiting to be sent home) does not exactly hide easily in someone's bodice.The Bad Guys (tm) will smuggle soap, so they can extract the glycerin used in making the soap for manufacturing nitroglycerin. (If you're going to smuggle, it'd be easier, faster, and much cheaper to smuggle pure glycerin in the first place.) Sneaking it in would be pointless, in any case - it's never been contraband, or even suspicious. Even in times in which paper matches are considered too dangerous to allow on plane flights, nobody tracks or cares about glycerin - it's cheap, harmless, and totally innocuous.The Bad Guys smuggle the finished nitroglycerin in wine bottles. An amount of nitro that would fit comfortably in a wine bottle would scare the heck out of anyone who knows nitro - anything over an ounce or two would make a very large bang. Then, they fit a shipment into an elaborate, spring-loaded frame - as no wine was ever shipped in.The comic relief has become slapstick (the horse smoking the pipe, the small 10-yo boy challenging the two armed adults to combat, the switch/ruler swordfight with the priest teacher), the agenda/message is overbearing, and the plot holes outweigh the plot by a lot. Yet, the acting is solid, the action satisfying, and some of the intentional humor is well-done. It doesn't hold a candle to the first movie, but it's reasonably amusing - especially if you can overlook the flaws.",The Legend of Zorro
69,KingProjector93,A noticeable step down,5,16 April 2015,"Following on several years after 'Mask', Alejandro and Elena are going through a bit of a relationship tiff, with Elena feeling that Zorro is taking away from proper family time, primarily in being there for their son, Joaquin. The timing could not be worse as a slimy foreign count is on the scene, wooing Elena, Pinkertons are snooping around, and a deadly new weapon that could turn the tide of the Civil War (ten years earlier here) is being tested nearby.Though it still boasts big stunts and tongue-in-cheek jabs at the mythos, 'Legend' swaps matinée charm for grating spousal comedy. A huge part of this, I feel, is down to a change in writers. Instead of Ted Elliot & Terry Rossio, who have built their careers on that kind of balancing act, we get the second screenplay by Hollywood's premiere love-hate duo, Orci & Kurtzmann. Beyond the numerous and headscratching historical errors, including a Confederate movement 10 years pre-Civil War, their trademark obnoxious humour is here, incarnate in the form of an almost childish matrimonial dispute between Alejandro and Elena, that doesn't mesh well with the derring-do.One minute, we have fun, well directed action and some decent carry overs of the whole 'man and mask' motif from the first film, the next, Alejandro is utterly drunk and Elena whines. It gets old really fast. Add to that a rehashed score by James Horner that adds little new flair, and you have something that feels deflated and uninspired.A shame, as the players are still great in their roles, Banderas and Zeta-Jones as fiery as ever together, while Sewell chews scenery as the villainous fop. Even Adrian Alonso as Joaquin is not a half bad child actor, and seeing him play Zorro and duel a teacher is perhaps one of the few funny gags in the film. And well, despite the lax script, Campbell still does a top notch job directing, with dynamic set pieces (such as the opening chase and final train battle), tight editing and beautiful Californian vistas. However, you can't polish average, which is what this is.",The Legend of Zorro
70,LadyLiberty,The Legend of Zorro Will Soon Be Forgotten,3,6 November 2005,"I really liked 1998's The Mask of Zorro, and was delighted to hear about the sequel. The first film had been so much fun to watch that the second  which boasts the return of its major stars  just had to be fun to watch, too. That just goes to show you how completely baseless expectations can be.The Legend of Zorro opens some dozen or so years after the end of The Mask of Zorro. Alejandro de la Vega (Antonio Banderas)  the alter ego of Zorro  and the beautiful and fiery Elena Montero (Catherine Zeta-Jones) are married and have a young son. But the passion of their early years in love and on crusade has been tempered a good deal in Elena's mind by the responsibility of parenthood. She is, in fact, not at all thrilled with her husband's ongoing habit of turning into Zorro when he's needed and she's not afraid to tell him  repeatedly  so.Elena's nagging does get Alejandro to promise to stop his derring do just as soon as California's pending statehood and a volatile voting process is complete. That's not soon enough for Elena, though, and she drives him out of the family home. No sooner has she done so than she is accosted by two strange men on the street who demand her assistance. Meanwhile, she also runs into an old childhood friend from Spain (who is, bizarrely, a Frenchman) who promptly begins to woo her.The handsome but cold Armand (Rufus Sewell) causes Alejandro no small amount of jealousy. But there's more than Elena's romance to worry about. The couple's child Joaquin (Adrian Alonso) is getting into trouble at school, and a mysterious and powerful explosion at a vineyard piques Alejandro's interest and sets his warning senses clanging.If all that isn't enough, there are also detectives poking around, Confederate soldiers looking for aid to their cause before the country erupts into civil war, a governor who seems an incompetent at best, a band of smugglers, and the vicious Mr. McGivens (Nick Chinlund) who wanders around terrorizing the locals during the course of what he says is ""doing God's work."" Whew! There's so much going on in this movie that it actually comes as a bit of a shock to find that the plot is quite shallow. While things do dovetail together nicely in the end, there are no surprises and little drama to get from here to there. Worse, in a misguided attempt to be funny, some of the script devolves well into a cartoonishness that only the most immature could find amusing. (Example: Alejandro gets falling-down drunk  and so does his horse.) To make matters worse, for whatever reason, the wonderful chemistry between Banderas and Zeta-Jones that was so evident in the first movie is visibly strained here.Banderas and Zeta-Jones aren't bad, though lack the passion of the first film; Rufus Sewell shows so little facial expression most of the time that I actually found myself looking for movement more intently than I was listening for lines. Thankfully, Nick Chinlund is melodramatically bad and thus really quite good, while young Adrian Alonso acquits himself well. The sets and costumes are lovely (though some of the mattes appeared inexcusably cheap), but those things can't do much to bolster the shallow and silly script that is the movie's downfall.The Legend of Zorro has a few redeeming moments not the least of which are stunts involving Zorro's gorgeous black horse. There are also some decent sword fights. But even a good deal of the action is so scripted and choreographed that it lacks the same excitement the script itself is so bereft of having. Too bad. I would have loved to see the movie I'd been hoping for. Instead, perhaps it's best that only a few of us see the movie that it proved to be.POLITICAL NOTES: With the backdrop of California's march toward statehood, there's much that could have been said and done here. Unfortunately, none of it was. What was pointed out, however, was the need in the minds of some to ensure that the United States be taken down a notch before becoming too powerful. Though the statement was made within the thin context of the film, it's almost impossible not to see it as a comment on the world today and the echo of the viewpoint of an appalling number.FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Legend of Zorro is rated PG for ""sequences of violence/peril and action, language, and a couple of suggestive moments."" The rating is probably just about right, but parents of younger kids should be cautioned that there are moments of subtitled dialogue as well as taking note of a couple of particularly nasty deaths (not graphic on screen, but the methods are gruesome). Those same parents will also want to watch out for the inevitable imitation some children will try after seeing young Joaquin attempting his own rendition of Zorro-like behavior. Otherwise, The Legend of Zorro is mostly harmless, especially since it's a movie you'll likely forget not long after leaving the theatre anyway.",The Legend of Zorro

72,keesha45,"""We were never meant to be together""",9,22 April 2007,"Elena couldn't be more wrong. Zorro's teaming with a love interest who can fight nearly as well as him has revived the Zorro films that had the character played so well by such greats as Tyrone Power and Douglas Fairbanks. While some reviewers and IMDb commentators rate this below the first Banderas film, I think in many ways it's superior. The romance is still terrific, with a boy-loses-girl-then-gets-girl-back plot line that works very well. The action sequences are every bit as exciting as I remember them from the first film. Additionally, the picture throws in a temperamental Tornado, whose jump onto a moving train would make Yakima Canutt envious, and Adrian Alonso's junior Zorro is the best pre-teen action actor I've seen since Ernie Reyes, Jr. The French count was not an especially great villain, but his henchmen, the scar-face and the bald claw-handed butler, make up for his deficits. Granted, there were a lot of goofs that commentators and others pointed out, but since when did historical accuracy get in the way of a good Hollywood movie? I would be shocked if there's not another Zorro sequel and I hope Steve Spielberg has a hand in the next one, like he did here. And let's have more of the young son Joaquin. Even if Tony and/or Cathy decide to forego future Zorros, a son of Zorro could continue the franchise quite nicely. Dale Roloff",The Legend of Zorro
73,abum190,"Not worth seeing- see the first one instead, even if you've already seen it",5,21 March 2006,"Within the first five minutes, I knew this movie was not going to be as good as the first one. Some may say that you shouldn't compare a movie its prequel, that a movie should stand alone, but that's dumb and people know it. You cannot watch this film without thinking about Mask of Zorro and recalling just how much more fun it was and, at the same time, how well everything was pulled off.Now I know there are a lot of people who never saw Legend's prequel, but even if you did, this one's not worth seeing. The action is cheesy and the camera has trouble focusing on it to make it interesting. The plot line is slightly intriguing, but the juvenile way in which the story is written forces you to accept that the movie's not going to try any harder to recognize your intelligence- the movie even gives its key plot twist away before it means to, which kind of ruined it for me. Even Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, both of which were very good in the first film, seemed forced and hammy in Legend.See, this is the kind of movie that you wouldn't really mind watching on an airplane where you don't have much to do anyway and you don't have to spend any money for it. But if you have to pay to see it, don't.",The Legend of Zorro
74,movieguy81007,Surprisingly Good,10,6 December 2006,This movie is not as bad as everybody says. The Legend of Zorro is surprisingly good. Antonio Bandares does a good job and so does Catherine Zeta Jones. This movie has great action. I will not forget the kid cause he did a good job too. I did not know Martin Campbell directed this one. This movie is just as good as the first one. I liked the costumes just like with the first one. This movie had good humor just like the first one also. Antonio Bandares is the perfect Zorro I can not see any one else playing Zorro. Martin Campbell did a good job directing both. This movie was never boring. This movie kept my interest. The critics did not like this one but I have to disagree.,The Legend of Zorro
75,Matador07,"Alas, Zorro Goes Hollywood",4,7 September 2006,"I moderately enjoyed The Mask of Zorro. It was a solid actioner with some style. So I decided that The Legend of Zorro was at least worth a look despite its meek appearance at the box office.Well...it wasn't. This truly was the triumph of Hollywood over storytelling. A gigantic modern movie cliché just dressed up in a black mask and cape. We had in it a) a cute kid; b) spouting modern slang one liners; c) an emasculated Zorro in a modern family crisis; d) a superhero heroine who apparently could have whipped all the bad guys herself; e) that is if she did not need her 10 year old son's help, who himself, in true Home Alone fashion, was equal to any 10 supposedly intimidating bad guys. Along the way we also get a whole horde of 21st century supporting characters anachronistically wandering around in 19th century costume, and even more stupid clichéd Hollywood moments, false deaths, and general annoyances. Over the seemingly interminable length of the film I went from being vaguely amused, to vaguely bored, to considerably annoyed. Between this and the Bruckenheimer King Arthur joke one wonders if Hollywood's ""best"" have even a remote clue what history (or historical myth) actually is. These cookie cutter modern garbage flicks are getting old.",The Legend of Zorro
76,dragonshield,"A surprisingly good action movie, but why on earth must Zorro have a son?",5,29 May 2007,"After 7 years they made a sequel and to be honest it's a decent sequel as well. The movie itself isn't anything mind breaking, but it sure was better than I expected. OK, first of all, the whole plot is rather cheesy, though it does include a few twists here and there. Alejandro De LaVega aka Zorro has tried keeping his heroic actions in minimum but once again the citizens of California are in a desperate need of help. Zorro takes action and goes on an adventure to save the world again. Corny, yes, but the movie has its moments.Like already mentioned the story isn't anything special, but the screenplay surprises with its witty dialog between Zorro and his wife Elena. Although this sequel being much more humorous than the first movie the dialog between those two characters gives the movie that extra something and it's really entertaining to see Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones working together. The movie is filled with funny jokes between the characters and elsewhere, although some of the jokes being so cliché that they don't even make you laugh. Zorro also has a few corny yet hilarious punchlines in his pocket, which also makes the movie a movie not meant to be taken so seriously and a movie more enjoyable for the male -fans. It gives the movie some more of that man power after all. The role performances of Banderas and Zeta-Jones are nothing phenomenal, but they're still pretty flawless and as both them being good actors it makes the movie more entertaining as well.The one thing where the movie goes so wrong is that Zorro has a son. Now how many times have we seen a movie (sequel to be exact) where the main hero has a son who turns out to be important for the whole plot? Yup, too many times. In this movie Zorro's son just happens to know a few Zorro -moves and despite the numerous attempts of directors who have thought it would be funny, it just isn't. It has never been. The director's vision of humour fails completely. Zorro's son Joaquin is played by an 11 year old actor named Adrian Alonso and the acting he does is that repetitive pattern we always see all over again when it comes to family movies. It is horrible and it ruins the whole overall feeling of the movie. Every time I saw Alonso on the screen I just felt like rewinding the scenes as they are in fact as horrible as you can imagine. There was actually only one single line I thought the actor did a good job in, one single line for god sakes. OK, he was only 11 at the time, but still, why can not they find better actors for roles like this? Joaquin also has a few punchlines in his pocket, but as they're so unfunny, done unbelievably and being so irrelevant they're just bad. The fact that Zorro has a son in the movie is the biggest problem the movie suffers from. Without the son the movie would have been much much better, but done is done and we can't change that, now can we? It's a shame really.If we get back to the things I like about the film, the other thing coming to my mind is how well the action scenes were made. Martin Campbell who we know now from for example ""Casino Royale"" sure can direct some great action parts. They're very entertaining and they flow in a complimenting way. I was surprised how good the choreographs of the fights were and seeing them from the screen you just have to give your two thumbs up, as when those scenes take place they will most certainly entertain you. The music by the great James Horner just raises the entertain -level and gives those scenes that extra bump which they need. Most of the time these scenes flow like a good dance; Left foot there, turn around, raise your hand and right foot down, very nice.""The Legend of Zorro"" isn't nearly as good as the first one, although the first one not being a masterpiece either. The sequel has its quality moments and when those moments are on you will most certainly be enjoining them. Despite the movie being filled with cliché's it's very entertaining and it's an action packed ride throughout. It sadly suffers from that one huge problem, even a mistake, and that is the son which just had to be put in the movie. Yeah yeah yeah, it's a family movie but they could have at least tried something else, for example leaving out the whole story about the son. The movie isn't a masterpiece, but it's surprisingly entertaining and for those who haven't seen the movie yet; When you do, just turn your brain off and don't take the movie too seriously. When you do that you will have a little smile of pleasure on your face when the movie ends. I promise.",The Legend of Zorro
77,phillipstephenso,Antonio is Zorro,9,4 December 2005,"Antonio Bnaderas was born to be Zorro the Fox. No one else comes close to bringing this folk hero to life. Also, Catherine Zeta-Jones gives a remarkable performance as his wife. (In what other movie can you see her smoking a pipe? And, so does Zorro's horse). The beautiful start of the film with the Z in fire is striking as the last frames of the film showing Zorro on his horse with his sword pointed upward in the sunset while Mexican musicians play their hearts out in the background. In fact, this film brings the whole legend to life with beautiful music, photography, and a clever script full of action, humor, and an original plot Zorro will always be the hero of the common man in his struggles against the predatory nobility. In this film, the traditional Spanish hierarchy is allied with the Confederate warlords contemplating a preemptive strike against Washington. And the use of nitrogyclerine as a ""weapon of mass destruction"" echoes current concerns also. If you love to watch Antonio show off his body in the hot tub and display superb sword fighting and horsemanship and passion, this is heaven.",The Legend of Zorro
78,h-62007-26888,Zorro faces his greatest challenge yet: Getting Divorced!,5,19 May 2021,"Oy...yep, this exists. I won't blame the writers for any of this...I take that back, this is all their fault. They took a beloved icon like Zorro and turned him into a generic adventure movie that plays too safe, complete with a STUPID premise where Zorro has problems IN HIS LOVE LIFE. I'd also like to add that part of the problem is with the characters, where some have zero motivations, are despicably bitter, downright pointless, or just plain IRRITATING by how they NEVER GO AWAY. Oh, and did I forget to mention about the amount of OVERACTING done by the cast who try to be more cartooney than in THE FIRST?!But I can't get on this movie's case too much. It does indulge in the Zorro action as one would expect and has a lot of fun with it, the practical effects used harken back to a simpler age where there was no need for large budgets, and I admittingly DO NOT HATE Joaquin. Seriously, as much as people call him an irritating little s--t, he really deserves better.In conclusion? Great action + bad writing + Sequelitus + unoriginality + zorro = The Legend of Zorro.",The Legend of Zorro
79,druss44121-1,back in black,4,20 October 2005,"Pop quiz! Okay, so is it a good or bad sign when a hit adventure film spawns a sequel seven years after its initial release? Common sense says this is a bad thing (and I'm not talking about that pamphlet from Thomas Paine), but The Legend of Zorro proves a different truth.Yes, it is true. The Legend of Zorro is half decent. Go ahead and slap that on your posters, Sony Pictures.The plot is pretty much the traditional powerful bad guy wants to take over the world, or a sizeable portion of it, with some obscure evil plan that of course will never work. However, a Zorro film does not necessarily sink or swim because of its plot alone.Remarkable locations, intense action and memorable characters can keep a popcorn film alive, especially one destined to mediocrity from the get-go.Most of these elements are at work here, helping to making the experience enjoyable.Nick Chinlund, who played the bounty hunter Toombs in the misfire that was The Chronicles of Riddick, plays an effective sadistic henchman with a mouthful of wooden teeth.Also notable is Adrian Alonso who is only slightly annoying as Joaquin, the child of Zorro and his beautiful warrior wife Elena played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. Thankfully Alonso's screen time is mercifully limited.Despite the fact that this Zorro outing is rated PG (the original The Mask of Zorro from the summer of '98 was a hard PG-13), this new film is perhaps more brutal than its predecessor.Although blood never spurts out spastically there are numerous instances of people dying, being burnt with fire and even exploding. Also, near the beginning a character falls into a cactus, resulting in a lovely face full of painful needles.Thus, it is relieving to know that The Legend of Zorro doesn't quite become the film for little kids its rating and trailers have suggested.With that said, there is a level of goofiness that rears its ugly head at a few unfortunate spots. Still, the slapstick rarely becomes downright embarrassing, and the stupidest moments are already proudly displayed in the TV spots (I'm looking at you ""E Z."") In short, this is far from a mature film but it is a successful match to the first film, and chances are if you enjoyed The Mask of Zorro (assuming you remember it, I was thirteen years old when it came out in theatres), you will enjoy this.Martin Campbell, the director of the original and of the upcoming Bond movie Casino Royale, keeps the action heavy and quick in this fluffy adventure. The film especially opens with a bang, not wasting any time to get straight into the action.One aspect of The Legend of Zorro that is somewhat surprising is the beautiful cinematography. Certain shots are really breathtaking, and most of the action takes place in clear day and can actually be followed.Speaking of this, some of the stunts are eye catching. Refusing to use the popular digital stuntmen of today's day and age it is refreshing to see a real stuntman doing flips and jumps.It is probably a double blessing that CG is rarely used, for when it does appear it truly is laughable. There is one computer generated reaction shot of a horse widening its eyes that is so absurd in both idea and execution that, well, it is a very good thing that if you blink you will miss it.Still, the fight sequences are impressive, if absurd.Banderas himself gets in some wicked sword moves, and the mix of the aforementioned stunt doubles and the actors is well balanced.That is, except for the stunt double of Joaquin who clearly is an adult. How exactly the child of Zorro even became so talented in fighting remains a mystery. Is it implied that his ""Zorro"" genes give him the unique ability to do acrobats at age 10? There are actually many moments that require quite a bit of suspension of disbelief, but with this type of film that's not necessarily a bad thing.Worse, though, is the two hour plus runtime, as this vapid action adventure begins to wear out its welcome about twenty minutes too early. It doesn't really ever become terribly boring or unbearable to the point of inducing stress, but some stuff could have been cut. This certainly shouldn't pretend to be The Lord of the Rings.With all this said The Legend of Zorro works. Likely successfully because much of the talent from the original film has returned, this film is in the same league as its predecessor. There are more moments that work than ones that don't.In the end it can be put bluntly: if the idea of a new Zorro film interests you, you won't be too disappointed. If it doesn't, well, this won't convert non-believers.Critic's Conclusion: Although the timing of an action adventure film for Halloween is a bit weird, perhaps The Legend of Zorro will prove to be successful counter programming. If you enjoyed the first film (assuming you remember it), you will enjoy this fluffy but enjoyable ride. It opens October 28th opposite Saw II.Rating: 3 out of 5 stars",The Legend of Zorro
80,MeloDee,"A ""bad"" action movie.",6,21 August 2006,"Near the end of my film, my brother and I joked about how this film was a ""good bad action movie."" We consider ""bad actions movies"" as almost a sub-genre inside of action. Oh yes, they can be quite ""fun"", with pretty explosions and battles to boot, but they also contain a myriad of clichés.The Legend of Zorro contains several ingredients that qualify it as a bad action movie, or even just an action movie in general;A hero who's really awesome in hand-to-hand, gymnastics, and a variety of stunts (this time including with a whip) A sexy, butt-kicking heroine The aforementioned pair's small son, who has an ""attitude problem"" and seems to think he's a hero (but he is, sort of) A guy who is utterly vile and cruel, simply for the sake of being utterly vile and cruel A classy, groomed main villain with an evil stare A plot of said main villain to destroy the U.S., kill the hero's son, AND steal the hero's wife at the same time A little plot twist thrown in to make us think the story actually is about more than thatSo what are my opinions concerning each of these elements? The hero and heroine are fine. Their son? He was a total brat, but I liked him, and the kid playing the role could really act. I was even more impressed when I discovered he hadn't even been able to speak English when he was chosen to play in this movie!As for the vile and cruel dude...yeah he was a little over the top. You know, how he can't seem to take a shower, grins to show his even filthier teeth, is racist, bears a cross-shaped scar and quotes scripture whilst talking about going about ""The Lord's work?"" The guy seems to love harassing Mexican farmers for no apparent reason, but hey, what the heck? We just needed somebody to hate, and Harrigan's there to satisfy our appetite to the fullest. I personally wasn't satisfied so much that I didn't stop to wonder why on earth the classy bad guy would have such a one in his employ.The groomed antagonist with the malevolent stare played his role to near-perfection. His ploy to destroy the U.S. didn't really make sense to me, but then, he was French and all that so I guess maybe that was the script-writer's excuse?Anyway, moving on. There's one thing about this film that you keep on wondering about even after it's over. How the heck did Zorro get there? Yeah, we know that a typical superhero cliché is that when there's trouble, somehow the superhero appears there. On closer examination of better and more mature films, we can note that the superhero didn't just ""appear"" there but rather followed a series of clues that led him to arrive to the scene of the crime just in the nick of time.In this, however, you get the impression that either the script writer was just extremely lazy or Zorro's telepathic. The fact remains, that Zorro is NOT telepathic and therefore his timely interventions in the villain's evil plans are improbable.Another improbable thing, is an antagonist, who by all accounts despite the whole hiring Harrigan thing seems pretty darned intelligent, deciding not to kill the protagonist when he has the chance. Instead, he leaves it to an unreliable henchman, without even staying behind to make sure the guy gets the job done. Come on, this is Zorro. What kind of idiot would do that? Additionally, even though Harrigan's unreliable and pretty much a psycho, he does something that's incredibly stupid even for him, which, of course result's in Zorro's easy escape. Now here's the part I feel really, really proud of myself for noticing. Do you know how the bad guy invents nitroglycerin? Well it turns out, that as I suspected, nitroglycerin was invented 13 years AFTER California became a state. Oh, that's not that bad of a goof, but goofs can be quite culminating.So what is my overall opinion of this film? I actually enjoyed the whole viewing experience quite a bit, and would even be willing to watch it again. Zorro and Elena's comedic arguments and unmistakable attraction were more than entertaining. However, I missed Anthony Hopkins, I missed having a good plot, I couldn't convince myself that that whip would've actually wrapped around anything and supported someone's weight, and if I'd had to pay for this movie, I would've felt cheated.",The Legend of Zorro
81,obrofta,Flawed but Fun,7,13 November 2005,"My better half and I went to Zorro out of curiosity. We had seen the first film, but after seeing the review Roger Ebert wrote, I was hesitant to consider this a ""franchise."" ""Still,"" I said to myself, ""How bad can it be with that wonderful Zeta-Jones/Banderas chemistry?"" To a certain extent my suspicions were well founded. However, the chemistry between the two stars could have been played out more to earn more critical acclaim.I did not agree with Ebert's assessment that the producers had made Zeta-Jones into a nag. There was the conflict at the beginning, but further aversion to each other was produced by new situations. From that standpoint, the plot had some merit.I agree with Ebert and others, who complain of the ""campiness"" of this movie. I liked the son, and even though Elena (Zeta-Jones)had earned her swordsmanship points in ""Mask"", the fight sequences looked altogether staged for visual perspective instead of believable sequences. Additionally, the movie did not sell me on Jacquin's physical prowess, but rather produced scenes, which more than bordered on comedic farce. ""Still,"" I say, ""it's Zorro (for goodness sake)."" We had good villains, a new ""holy"" aide (but when we saw him alive, who was surprised that the crucifix stopped the bullet? Please!), and plenty of stylish romp to send Sharon and I by the exit sign with smiles on our faces. I would give it a six (6 out of 10), but am ready for one more segment, so I will encourage the producers by giving it a 7. However, a word to the producers: Banderas and Zeta-Jones will not stay young forever (though Zeta-Jones sure is trying - wow, did she look good or what?)---let's sign them both quickly, and can we make this next one a little more believable? Well, we had ""Mask"" and ""Legend"". Perhaps, ""Heritage"" will be the last.",The Legend of Zorro

83,shadowycat,A Zorro-ful Tale,6,23 October 2005,"Caught Zorro at a screening last week. It was too loud, and other people thought so too. But ah... screenings, pristine print, it's all good. And, I was surprised. Zorro's had a makeover! They've reinvented him as the Mexican Batman. I'm dead serious. I got the feeling they sat down with a checklist of things they've liked from other franchises to weave into the story. The brought in elements of Batman, Van Helsing, Indiana Jones, and James Bond. There's also a nod to favorite Bond Bad Guys OddJob and Jaws. There's a line in the film where someone says Zorro is out of date, his time has passed. Perhaps this echoes the premise from which the writers were commissioned to work. We had the sense of someone saying ""Bring in elements from these other hot properties..."" This is not to say it isn't fun. It's fun in the 'this is a romp, leave your sense of reason at the door...' because there's a lot of stuff that we're asked to believe even though it's ridiculous -- how could the kid be unable to recognize his father, when the only disguise is a Zorro mask? Sorry, I think any kid could recognize his Dad even in a full-on rubber mask. Kids know their parents.But you know what? Every kid wants his parents to be Batman, or Zorro, or God. So the film does kind of touch a universal sentiment. And the two guys playing Pinkerton Guards are fabulous - my favorite characters in this film. But the story of Zorro was never a steam punk thriller, it's always been more of a Robin Hood myth, and this film presents a complex inner plot. And, the thriller at the heart of this Zorro-ful tale story unfolds with the structure of a modern science fiction fantasy -- OK then.There's some great pyrotechnics and imaginative gadgetry (oh ya... and if Zorro is the Mexican Batman, Catherine Zeta-Jones steps forward with her own measure of MacGuyver thrown in, not to mention the ability to sword fight while dressed in full-on Maja grandeur) and I think I liked that she's resourceful and absolutely in control... she manages to be a powerful woman and never break a sweat. No mean feat.There's a great explosion toward the end of the film (there just had to be) and I cheered. It's all very predictable, but I didn't have a bad time. Cinematically it's vivid and beautiful (they staged a lot of shots to look like 1940's wild west romance book covers come to life) and silly (like the guy who gets a face full of cactus spines) and oh ya... the horse could have been named Senor Eduardo. He doesn't actually *talk* but OH COME ON. (You'll see what I mean - trust me)My only complaint was that the village felt a little like being at a theme park rather than in an actual period village. But kudos to the kid they cast! He has one of the toughest roles in the film, and he's not insipid! Nothing is worse than child actors who simper and suck. Yeah this new Zorro was OK... a good family matinée experience for the whole family. The audience will be happy -- unless they're the cynical type or prefer zombie movies.",The Legend of Zorro
84,ms_jade_li,"Formulaic, but reminiscent of old style westerns -- with a Latino cast",8,5 November 2005,"I liked the film.You aren't going to get a more aesthetic movie than this: the actors (wow, Antonio and Catherine Zeta both in the same movie -- Anjelina & Brad, eat your hearts out -- no contest!), the costumes, the lighting, the villa and townscapes, and the sheer beauty of the location, day and night.Antonio looks a little more ""mature"" than I've seen him in awhile, but he's no less smoldering and charming on the screen. He's a natural for playing Zorro. The athleticism of Zorro is pretty impressive too. Lots of leaps, flips, and creative uses of his whip.Catherine-Zeta is breathtakingly beautiful, as always. Those eyes of hers... It's enjoyable to see her in a maternal role. I love her costumes! It's good to see her multi-tasking.Their son, Joaquim, is outstanding. Child stars usually make me gag, but this kid has genuine talent, and the person(s) filming and editing have admirably captured it.The main bad guy (the one with the mansion) is intriguing as well.

I suppose I just thought I would give it a whirl and see what it was like.I was pleasantly surprised with the whole thing. It was a lovely combination of action, humour and romance and I enjoyed the whole thing, especially the second half of the movie.The gags were really funny, especially the visual ones involving the horse and the guy who fell into the cactus. The action scenes were all very well done and acted out and the movie had a good pace to it, I was never once bored.A few things did spoil it however. Firstly, there was CZJ's terrible Mexican/Spanish accent and she can't act to save her own life. Secondly, how come Zorro always turns up in the nick of time to save the day? Is he telepathic or something? And the kid, I have a few issues with the kid. The first is how did he not realise that Zorro was his father until he removed his mask near the end? I mean, come on, the mask only covered the top half of his face and with features as distinctive as Banderas's, even a blind man on a galloping horse (get it?) would have realised who he was. The scenes with the kid and the catapult were great - he was a little hotshot with it and he really demonstrated how effective these things can be as weapons.Another bad piece of production to note was during the scene with the fight and the fire in the barn. It was blatantly obvious that the child was only a doll when CZJ picked it up, it was very poorly done in my opinion.However, apart from these few discrepancies, this movie is well worth a look - especially for the great ending and the spectacular death of the villain.An all-round enjoyable action adventure.

I did find it rather odd that it took them 7 years to make a sequel...but none the less they finally made it.The good news is that they didn't try rehash the first film all over again with bigger special effects and slightly different circumstances(like many sequels do..example: Die Hard 2) The Bad news is that is cannot hold a candle to the 1998 original. This movie is no where near as good as the first one.Once again, just like with the first film,the music score is great, the actors are perfect for their roles, the scenery is beautiful and the stunts, special effects & action sequences are great.(the first movie got all of those same elements right too)But this movie unlike the first movie, the story isn't as good. at most times the plot is very predictable. However I felt like the writers tried to hard to work in way too much comic relief, and it bogged the story down. The story takes a long time to develop, and when it does finally develop, everything happens pretty much they way you already knew it would.overall its not a bad movie, and it does have its moments. but there is way too much comic relief, and the story moves way too slow.... it is an 5 out of 10.

I will see the DVD, since they probably have extra scenes. Movies now are trailers for the DVD.""The Legend of Zorro"" deals with his family life. Unlike Batman or Superman, Zorro has a wife and a child. That kind of complicates things. In this movie, that is stressed. Both sides are at fault, as is usually the case in family matters.One thing, ""Zorro"" mentions the fact that California, and by extension, much of the US, was settled by Mexicans, who later became patriotic Americans. Pat Buchanan and American Patrol, among others, need to see this movie, to remind them of this fact. Mind you, Mexicans displaced the Native Americans. Pat Buchanan and most of the Mexican-bashers are not Native Americans, so they have no complaint. They are descendents of immigrants themselves.There are a lot of historical errors. Those who like history as a study in conspiracy's would like it. Shakespeare made a lot of historical errors too.",The Legend of Zorro

I was primed for this one from the moment I knew it was being made! Well put together, story makes sense for basically a family movie and the family angle plays out well if a little predictably. Lots of great action scenes and all the swashing and buckling you could ask for from both sides this time as both husband and wife get in their fair share of donnybrooks. The villain, well played by Rufus Sewell tries to steal the show but it really is the De La Vegas show all the way. The only complaint I could possibly make really is that the movie is well over two hours long, which can lead to squirming and running around for the younger set, but it is a fun ride.",The Legend of Zorro
92,plotlessviolence,fun fights,6,23 January 2006,"ACTION) The best part of this movie is by far the swordfights. Whereas the scenes in the first movie were pathetic, these are rather enjoyable. There's one at the beginning where Zorro hops along precariously balanced poles fending off three people simultaneously with foil and bullwhip.There's one or two short scenes later, and then they keynote of the movie is the final showdown, first an innovative horse-stunt sequence (including a move where Zorro stands on the hindquarters and whistles, getting the horse to buck his hind feet back and catapult our hero upwards) followed by a drag-out go-for-broke-style showdown with the main villain that's quite enjoyable. The problem with this second sequence is that the director cuts away to show other things happening constantly, which takes away from the action we care about.Furthermore, there's the villain's bald henchman, who loves flashing his weird bladed weapon, but when the time comes for him to fight the wife, it turns out he has no training whatsoever and that scene is pathetic.Worse, the couple's child is mystically capable of doing somersaults, handsprings, fence like a pro with a ruler, and fearlessly challenge 5 henchman simultaneously apparently ex nihilo. I mean, he didn't know his father was Zorro, so presumably he hasn't been trained, yet how come he can do stunts that would kill me? It rings false.Speaking of training, where's the training sequence in this movie? You always need a training sequence to justify powers. Granted, the first movie showed Zorro becoming Zorro and they did the training sequence there, but there's a stereotypical Banderas-depressed-alcoholic bit in this movie and a few minutes devoted to having him retrain his muscle memory would have enhanced the believability and enjoyment a bit.COMEDY) Wasn't really that funny.PLOT) Silly James-Bond like. This is a kids movie through and through, which explains the annoying child character, the fact that no one gets stabbed (those who MUST die for plot reasons vanish in unseen 'splosions! form) despite all the swordwork, and the fact that there's no discussion of whether Zorro's wife was sleeping with the man she was spying with even though it would be the obvious conversation to have. In sum, the plot was functional at best, often annoying or plodding, and really just a bare vehicle for the fight at the end. Still, it's a better movie than the first one if only for that last fight sequence.",The Legend of Zorro

Before going I checked IMDb, and seeing 6.0 I went prepared to see stuff worse than the first film.But nowhere was I prepared to what will come. Right the beginning looked like a B-cat remake of a comics. And later there was nothing but a series of plot holes to keep up the makers' opportunity to show another few minutes of nonsense.The thing resembled a Bud Spencer/Terence Hill flick except it was not fun at all, and pretended to be serious and even historic.Yeah, sure, Banderas still take all the girls' hearts, Jones is a pleasure, there are other fine actors, sets, models, plenty of money -- why couldn't someone stop for a moment to think some plot, some 'reality' (meaning just in like in a fantasy film, that makes SENSE in itself...)

If it wasn't for the always great performances of Antonio as Zorro and his son Zorro Jr. it would have been a total flop. And what's up with Catherine Zeta-Jones? This woman actually won an Oscar? No wonder the Academy is taking such heat for its lack of judgment! She sucks! No, I really mean it she just sucks BIG TIME! She is so bad and so unsympathetic a character that one spends most of the movie hoping and praying that one of the other awful characters would please just shoot her! I would have seriously considered giving this movie a 7.5 or even an 8 if Elena had been played by an actress who could actually act! (Selma Hyack for instance.) If you like Zorro, well, Bandaras has always been to me a really great Zorro, he just has the character down so well. Once we get to some Zorro action, its OK.

100,WheelerClown,"Entertaining, but a pale imitation",7,2 November 2005,"The legend of Zorrow does have it's moments of entertainment and humor. And it's not a bad movie to watch. But it pales in comparison to the original, more so than a lot of sequels. (And we all know sequels rarely outshine the first movies.) The story is lamer, and the fiery chemistry that existed between Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones in the original is sadly lacking here as is the elegance that Banderas portrayed as a don in the first movie (disappointing since in the original he was only pretending to be a don, whereas in this movie he really is one). There is a little humor between Zorro and Toronado (his horse), But it occasionally gets downright outlandish (like when Elana (Zeta-Jones) drops a pipe from an upper window and Zorro later finds the horse smoking it...yeah, right) And the main villains demise is a little too reminiscent of that of the villain in the first movie.All that said, the movie is okay in its own right (if you don't compare it to the original). The action scenes, while more Jackie Chan-ish than in the original are entertaining. (Although the first one involving Zorro's young son is a trifle unbelievable). And while the original chemistry between the leads is missing, the many arguments they have are somewhat entertaining. I wouldn't recommend this movie as Academy Award material, but neither would I say stay away from it. Don't compare it too much to the original and you'll probably enjoy it.",The Legend of Zorro
101,pzazz_hij,Extravagant Hollywood style of swashbuckling adventures,7,24 October 2005,"Without focusing too much on the original i will say that there is no doubt that 'The Mask of Zorro' was a cracking piece of entertainment that i could watch many times over again. But being a fan of all swashbuckling style adventures similar to the likes of Zorro there was no way that it beat any of the early Hollywood stuff of the genre. Where 'The Mask of Zorro' took the legendary hero to new heights with a new story line, compared to previous Zorro films, that didn't turn out to be bad, plus the special effects and unbelievable acrobatics it was basically modern Hollywood being extravagant with a swashbuckling adventure film.'The Legend of Zorro', surprise surprise, is no different.My first thoughts when seeing the trailers was that it would rely on nothing but special effects and that Martin Campbell would try to find any excuse to blow something up. I wasn't too far wrong but i have to say i totally forgot about that after the first action scene in the film and ultimately i gave him credit where it was due as far as quality entertainment goes.The acrobatics and extreme movement is the first thing that catches your eye and safe to say i don't think its possible that any man could have done some of the stuff we see Zorro do throughout the film. But, to be fair it is a real treat to sit back and watch. It seems that every time we see Zorro in an action scene he finds some excuse to do a forward flip or something similar but like i said it is superb to watch even if a bit too over the top.The big explosions in the film can also be forgiven in a value for money entertainment sort of way, as the whole part of the villains plot involves an explosive and too be fair the writers came up with a good excuse by which they could execute this feature.The only real problem i had with 'The Legend of Zorro' was the end scene in which i was not, by any means, accepting the final fight. It was a bit too adventurous and relied purely on the special effect which was a huge shame and did spoil it for me.'The Legend of Zorro' is crawling with bad points and no doubt there will be others who will exploit every single one but for me Zorro returned for a thrill ride like no other this year and for family action adventures its definitely one to watch.",The Legend of Zorro
102,LupinsGal2004,This was a very good movie,9,1 November 2005,"I saw the movie mostly because it was getting terrible reviews in the papers. usually when paid critics give movies bad reviews, it means they're pretty good.I was right. The acting was excellent in this movie. Perhaps even better than in the first. The action kept the movie going, the story was interesting, comedy kept things light, the violence wasn't gratuitous, the swearing was minimal and tame at best, and the sexual gratuity was non-existent (Which proves that if you need gratuitous sex/violence and foul language, its only because you need to use it to hide all the stuff your movie lacks- like plot, acting ability, and good directing.) but this movie had excellent acting, a good storyline and lots of action to fall back on. It didn't need any of that ""Shock value"" crap a lot of movies need to hide behind. So I enjoyed it very much. It kept my attention through the entire length of the film.I'm not saying this movie isn't without its faults. There were some scenes that just kind of dragged on a bit, but for the most part, those complaints are extremely minor. I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves action, romance and good laughs.Don't listen to the ""paid"" critics who have been giving this movie poor reviews.

Actually scratch that, it's way worse than Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. The characters are terrible, not to mention having the most pathetic villain in cinema history. I normally don't do any spoilers, but these scenes and the plot are a completely embarrassment to the first film. A hero's son having a sword fight with his teacher with rulers, a hero playing polo with the main villain, doesn't sound like an action pack film to me. As for the plot, two government agents blackmailed Zorro's wife because they know Zorro's identity. Here's something that makes sense, why not blackmail Zorro to stop the main villain's evil plan?

104,Andyh74,"I Liked It, But A Change of Setting May Do Ya Some Good",7,3 April 2006,"In general I liked the movie, but I would have liked it if they had changed the time period to a later date. But first, let me quickly put down the pros and cons.Proschemistry b/w Alejandro and Elena (Banderas/Zeta-Jones); action sequences; further development of Elena's character; continuity with the first film; the film's unmasking sceneConsanachronisms or historical inaccuracies; plausibility of the plotNow I mentioned that the filmmakers should have moved the film's setting from 1850 to 1861. The current film makes it clear that the Civil War is years away, but I would set this film at the start of the Civil War--1861--for the following reasons.1) Doing so ages Alejandro/Zorro more and makes the issue of him retiring that much more pertinent because of his age. Here Alejandro is still somewhat middle-aged, and moving the story 21 years ahead makes his age a much more relevant issue. I understand that the filmmakers didn't want to feature Joaquin taking over as Zorro at the end of LOZ because they wanted Banderas and Zeta-Jones to come back for a third film. I still think that both of them could still come back for the third film--one where Alejandro is forced to come out of retirement and aid his son Joaquin (the new Zorro).2) This makes the current plot more plausible. As it stands, Count Armand and the society ""Orbis Unum"" intend to make what will be called nitroglycerin for the South, who will eventually use it. Why not have the society make and try to deliver the explosive for the South who are ALREADY at war with the North? Why do something for a FUTURE conflict?3) The 1861 setting brings another event into play, which could have been the film's plot instead. Count Armand is French. In the early 1860s France, along with the Roman Catholic clergy, backed the ascension of Archduke Maximilian of Austria to the title of Emperor of Mexico. Now they could have taken part of the plot--the manufacture of the explosive--and have that be part of France's oppression of the Mexican people, with France having future plans to take California (a rehash of the first film's plot). France's involvement in Mexico is true historical fact, and they could have instead made a plot involving this.4) The time change would eliminate the historical inaccuracies question that plagues LOZ. Did the Pinkertons exist in 1850? Why is Abraham Lincoln, here a lawyer sent to be a witness to the statehood ceremony, in this movie? Setting the film in 1861 eliminates these questions. The statehood part would be gone, but any presence of Lincoln now makes more sense, seeing as he was President at this time, and I'm sure the Pinkertons existed by this point. Things would ""fit"" better.So, I enjoyed the film, but I feel that if they had changed the setting to 1861, they could have improved the film. Now, I DO see how this film is somewhat in the ""Wild Wild West"" vein--using certain methods rather ahead of their time.However, I feel that changing the date to 1861 would have made things work better, or could have given them another good idea for the film's plot.",The Legend of Zorro

I personally thought that it wasn't going to be a good movie because I thought that were going to be some sex scenes in it and to my surprise there was none. The best new cast member in this story is the son. He really cares for his parents and the ones he loves and will do anything to defend them and to keep them safe.

As for me, with my interest in history and the historical backdrops of films, I figure it was old-fashioned illusionism. While my eyes are fastened on the beautiful assistant (Catharine-Zeta Jones as Elena De La Vega) the scriptwriters hope I don't notice the historical inaccuracies they try to slip by me, many of which are touched on in the 'goofs' section. I've got plenty of information, for instance, on the Henry Rifle, which was patented October 16, 1860, while California was admitted to the Union Septmebr 9, 1850. That didn't bother me so much as the supposed involvement of the Confederate Government, which wouldn't be organized for 11 yeas. The only plot premise that had any credibility was the tension between Alejandro Vega (Antonio Banderas) and his wife over his activities as Zorro. She's naturally a bit worried that one of these nights his luck's going to run out and he'll be delivered home with a sword sticking out of his chest. Banderas and Jones show that they've got a little bit of the comic in them as they argue as they go about trying to foil the villains' plot.Plot wise i think the Tyrone Power-basil Rathbone version is best, but while Linda Darnell is - or was - nice in her heyday, Jones blows 'em all away.

They wanted to make a flamboyant PG-rated kids' movie and succeeded.

Also the plot point of making Elena opposed to Zorro's activities is completely out of character and out of line with the first movie. If you wanted to give them a kid that's fine but I think a family of Zorro's would've been much more in line with the characters set up in the first film. Ultimately, I don't really think this sequel was needed, but once the first act ends it picks up significant momentum.

116,mls-11,The Legend of Zorro - Don't Compare It To The First One,7,28 October 2005,"We saw ""The Legend of Zorro"" at our local theater tonight, long-anticipating a sequel to a wonderful film featuring Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones. While hoping it would follow suit with the first film, we were committed to going in with open minds.Simply, the film does not match the robustness, passion or provocative nature of the first film. That does NOT mean it is a bad film - just different.Strengths of the movie include admirable performing by the Alejandro and Elena stars. Clearly, their on-screen match-up was a great renewal. It was good to see them together again, though there was far less chemistry than they enjoyed in the first film.The stunt work was fairly good, though some was a bit over-the-top and not particularly believable. All in all, though, it added a bit to the overall story.The most disappointing aspects of the movie were select portions of the scripting and casting. For example, young Joaquin speaks in 2005 language - 150 years too early. Those creating the script should have restrained themselves, and used a bit more time to research the language of the era being portrayed in the story.As to scripting: unless my eyes deceived me, one of the padres in the film (actually, Joaquin's teacher) appeared to be one of the Dons from the first film. I am unsure why this would have been a choice by the casting folks - and further unsure why it would be approved by the producer or the director.Finally, the film seemed to drag out a bit - didn't need to be >2 hours long, in my estimation.With all of this said, it is worth seeing. Just don't expect the blockbuster film that was the first ""Zorro!""",The Legend of Zorro
117,sadya77,"very funny and fast dialogues, great action and a smart horse",8,26 December 2005,"This movie is not as bad as it has been received. In fact, none of the negative critics are right.Zorro is not supposed to be a Forrest Gump type movie or a Finding Neverland type movie. It's an action movie with a cool super hero and they did a great job.It had a different take here, because the wife and child of the super hero participate in the fight against the enemy. It made it even more interesting.And the script was very funny, made me laugh throughout the movie. After the movie was finished, I felt like I was very well entertained and I really saw a good movie.Oh, and love that horse. ;-D",The Legend of Zorro
118,markbond,Worth the 7-year wait,8,28 October 2005,"Someone needs to defend ""the legend of Zorro"". I am reading all kinds of reviews which criticize this movie for very minor details, when, in fact, this movie is really just trying to have fun.First - ""Legend of Zorro"" is nothing at all like the ""Spy Kids"" junk, which critics claim to see remarkable similarities. Yes, we know Antonio Banderas was in both films, and in both films his kids come to save the day...but the similarities stop there. The young actor they found to play Joaquin isn't there to be scenery, but is involved in the story like any other character, and even better - he's not painful to watch act (and he's got some great dialogue, too).Second - I enjoyed the fact that the storyline did not become a predictable, routine sequel. If we waited seven years to just watch Zorro fight another bad guy while mom & son stayed home...I would be angry. But the story used Elena and Joaquin in very creative ways. The only way its predictable is that Zorro saves the day - but just as to how he gets there, I never saw it coming.Third - I will admit, this is nowhere near the same level-of-quality that we saw in ""Mask of Zorro"". They set the bar far too high (and they let two other jerks BESIDES Ted Elliot & Terry Rossario write the movie). The comic relief was at times excessive, there were a few unnecessary Zorro backflips, leaps, and jumps in the fight scenes...but how can you absolutely dismiss a sequel for not being perfect? ""The Legend of Zorro"" met my expectations for a sequel, though did not surpass them. I still consider ""the Mask of Zorro"" to be THE BEST action/adventure film of the last 20 years. But to say ""Legend"" was outright horrible is just not fair. This is meant to be fun escapism, set in a beautiful 1850's California, starring actors who clearly are having a fun time, filled with sword fights, evil villains, great chases, and a clever story.Its only unforgivable sin was not finding one ""in"" - any ""in"" - that allowed Anthony Hopkins a cameo (like a flashback or a dream or something).",The Legend of Zorro
119,alphonsesclessin,Is he a drunk? Is he quite a poor dad? No it's Zorro!,4,1 January 2019,"Not convinced by this movie. Some aspects are just not right:
1 The original Zorro was a fine intelligent nobleman in this film Zorro is Some kind of spoiled rich kid with no manners whatsoever. That's not Zorro.
2 on a historical level the film is just a joke. Ok it's fantasy but still you can try harder.
3 The fighting scenes with the kid are an assault on anyones intelligence. Especially 'cause he triumphs multiple times over multiple armed adults. Again, I know it's fantasy and again I can only dat there's a limit to stretching the imagination in a non-fantasy world.
4 action scenes are not convincing probably due to trying to meet the 'all ages' requirements.Summary: not the worst film ever but there's better to be seen.",The Legend of Zorro
120,jsparacino,Roger Ebert is an idiot,8,15 February 2006,"This is a movie which was incredibly well done. The new villain was right out of the old ""Wild Wild West"". The continuity errors were a little intriguing: References to a ""Confederate Army"" in 1850 when the states didn't secede until 1861 and showing a Henry Repeating Rifle at least 10 years prior to its existence while no one carries a Colt Revolver which did exist at the time is rather odd. The performance by Antonio Banderas as Zorro vexed by the 2 sides of his existence was wonderful. The depiction of the ""chinatown"" area where acupuncture takes place was also interesting. The polo/joust sequence was rather funny. Ebert focused on the marital argument aspect of the scenes between Zorro and Elena; this is the same critic who also thought Moulin Rouge should have been best picture. Moulin Rouge was fun; but in an Ed Wood kind of way not because it was good. The legend of Zorro was a pleasant evening's diversion for my daughter and I and I hope there will be more movies by this team on this great story line.",The Legend of Zorro
121,fotw,Now don't you wish your dad was as cool as Zorro,3,19 November 2005,"The way I see it this movie is a comedy. Don't bother to watch it though, cos if you're above the age of 8 you probably won't find it funny. I though, Zorro and all, there'd be at least some fencing - and that was the sole reason i went to see the movie. Well, there was almost no fencing, Zorro just jumps around and always manages to hit his enemies over the head with something instead of killing them (yeah, those kids shouldn't be shown such abject things). And how about the ""man, once we start calling ourself American - we'll be in heaven"" routine? I suppose Americans won't mind that, but us europeans find it a bit annoying (not to mention the ""slovenian polo""). And of course what good is a movie without a plot to destroy the USA. You get that plus a little extra in the face of ""knights of aragon"", who seek to dominate the world as you might have already guessed. Oh, yeah - they intend to do it with soup - i always forget that part. Well i do have to admit that part was funny. And Kathrine Zita Jones makes faces that will certainly get you to laugh your ass off. What wasn't funny was, for example, the scene where little what's his name spanks his teacher up. What was that about? Then of course you have the ""divert the train off the collision course"" scene, which is probably like the oldest action cliché. The horse did a bunch-a ""funny"" stuff too. If you thought ""Wild Wild West"" was the bomb - go see ""the legend of zorro"". Also if you're looking for a movie for your son's sixth birthday - this is the flick for you. Otherswise i'm sure you'll find something better to do.",The Legend of Zorro
122,NS_writings,"Painfully, criminally underrated",8,30 May 2021,"While not as great as the original, I think this is a very good film. Entertaining, funny, sexy, charming, it just flows. Like its prequel, it has a very good cast and excellent villains and stunt scenes. The soundtrack, once again by James Horner, is perfect - I even like it slightly more than 'The Mask of Zorro', with a faster tempo and more orchestration. There are many complains of Joaquín (Zorro's son) getting in the middle of action, but you know, this is original. Most movies where the hero has a son have him as a helpless kidnap victim, yet here the son is somewhat useful to help his parents.One reviewer once said this is ""James Bond on horseback"" and I really agree. Many times I felt Bond had many similar traits as Zorro and here Campbell brilliantly combines both, in a way. Rufus Sewell's antagonist and his henchmen could have belonged to a Bond movie and they ran an organization somewhat similar to the 2015 version of SPECTRE - even the way he punishes someone he drops from the deal could have been a way Blofeld uses to dispatch a traitor!Go watch this and have a fun ride!",The Legend of Zorro
123,swisswuff,Pathetic,1,2 November 2005,"This movie - as opposed to others, including the Mask of Zorro movie - is pathetic. The action is repetitive and lacks bite. Most disturbingly, though, the faces of the actors now almost seem frozen. Maybe you noticed that the facial expressions of the actors hardly ever change. Banderas manages to mostly smirk wryly. Zeta Jones has no impact on the total feel of the movie at all; what makes her acting contribution stand out is that she has her eyes open all the way. The bad guy Armand walks around with two facial expressions: one being an ever- smirking face and widely open eyes - with sometimes the other angle of the mouth dropping too, making it a 'scared' look. This movie should have been called ""Everyone is Wearing A Mask"".",The Legend of Zorro

But I decided to go see it anyway - I've learned that I frequently don't agree with movie reviewers' opinions, after all. And I left the theatre fairly well satisfied with the movie - it was good entertainment, definitely worth the price of admission.Antonio Banderas does excellently reprising the role of Don Alejandro/Zorro, sword-fighting, swinging, and punching his way through the cool action scenes. The actor who plays his son is very cute and talented, as well. And though the story line is formulaic, with a few Western-movie clichés, this kind of movie is supposed to follow the formula, in my opinion. The only scene that I felt was a bit corny was the very last scene.If you liked ""Mask of Zorro"" and were excited when you saw the trailers for ""Legend"", go see it.

The story of a freedom fighter who is on the side of the common man and against all tyranny has become a campy melodrama which ignores history for the sake of ease of story and political correctness. The Mask of Zorro was not a brilliant film, but it was fun and it stayed true to the myth of Zorro. This film on the other hand was terrible. The Legend of Zorro begins ten years after ""Mask"" ends, California is becoming a free state and all seems well, right up until Elena ask Don Diego for a divorce. That's right, a divorce. Divorce happens in todays world, that's true, but in 1850, in a Catholic Culture a woman could not ask for a divorce. That is only the beginning my friends, even though it is only 1850 A man refers to the Confederate States and the civil war. What?!? There is more to be angry about than just the anachronisms, in this movie Zorro has a son that plays a significant part in the politics of the film and the fights are terribly choreographed with lots of silly moves and terrible thinking.

The writing, the choreography, it was just unable to come together to make a decent film.Lets start with the writing then, shall we? With gags so bad you can choke on them, writing so lackluster you wonder what else there is you can do to pass the time, around a concept that is hardly realistic, I really am disappointed. From professional writers, I'd expect them to provide at least something decent. But they went for stupid jokes (pipes), inversions (kid beating up his teacher) and clichés. Honestly, can't there be anything new? But no, it gets worse. The choreography follows suit with those bad gags from the writing. A hot poker up a bad guy's bum, women fighting in heavy mid-19th Century dresses (a woman would struggle running, much less fighting), honestly, it just became either boring or unbelievable (and sometimes both).Though Bandares tries to save the film, with only a few good lines, he fails. Zeta-Jones suffered from the fault of poor writing, and our villain was so clichéd as to incite rabid yawning.This film was very very bad. Big on special effects, and with a few good scenes, it fails just about everywhere else. The entire movie collapsed with the poor writing and directing, and the lackluster plot is moved forward in ways that make you cry.Honestly, to give this a good rating is to be far too easily impressed.A 2 out of 10.",The Legend of Zorro

It was excellent and every bit as good as the first movie if not better. Everything was well balanced story, action, humor, acting was very good including Zorro's son. Casting Antonio Banderas as Zorro was perfect. He is the only one that could play him so perfectly. I grew up watching Guy Williams as Zorro and enjoyed those TV shows very much. However Antonio is perfect in all ways as Zorro. The writers deserve kudos coming up with a perfect script, combining drama, humor, romance, and action. This was not a computer generated cartoon. They went to great lengths to make all stunts using real people. Antonio himself did more than most actors. It will truly be a regarded as a classic. The Perfect Zorro.",The Legend of Zorro
129,vercinger,Painful to watch,2,22 October 2013,"I sat through most of the movie feeling terrible. I knew that if I quit (and I really wanted to stop watching after 30-40 minutes!), my memories of The Mask of Zorro would be somewhat ruined by this truly terrible sequel. So I sat there, hoping it would get better. It barely did.The first half of the movie is a bad joke. Zorro is no longer a hero, but a stupid drunkard. His wife is an annoyance. Some of the fights are visibly overdone and thus not nearly as exciting as in the previous movie. The whole ""Yay! We're gonna become part of the United States! We're gonna be free, and Americans, and free, and everything's gonna be awesome, and we'll be free!"" setting is insulting in itself. We're never told what they're gonna be free of, or free to do.Many scenes involving Zorro and Tornado fall flat. Don Luiz's new calling as a teacher doesn't fit him. Zorro's child not knowing about his father's exploits is baffling. Divorced Zorro's drunken (and otherwise) jealousy scenes achieve nothing beyond making me feel uncomfortable. The western-style shoot-out is out of place. So is the whole espionage and conspiracy subplot.The only thing I'm not annoyed with is the fanatically religious racist prick of a villain/henchman. He's just average.It feels like things improve slightly in the later parts, or it could just be my expectations going through the floor. Most likely it's the fact Zorro stops being drunk. Regardless, I'm not going to spoil anything further. Just in case there are people out there who will enjoy this.Overall, it's like the creators wanted to put everything possible into a 2-hour movie. It's part comedy, part action, part soap opera, part western, part spy story, part mystery, part whatever-the-first-movie-was, part immature belch jokes. As can be expected, it doesn't work. It's a mess, made worse by the fact it's the sequel to a very good film. I highly recommend avoiding this if you have good memories of The Mask of Zorro.

The first had a good storyline, buckets of action complimented by just a dash of humour and plenty of romance.This lacklustre sequel tries to do the same, but though the action is still there it is weakened by a poor storyline, bad characters and misplaced humour. The bad guy is some religious nut case who I simply loathed - and not in a good way. He was just awful, spouting religious nonsense as if to give the film a modern flavour. A lot of the flaws of this film stem from this idea, the storyline revolves around terrorism in the new US of A and it stinks. I want Spain, I want dusty plains and mountains - the old romantic land of Zorro! As for the humour, it doesn't work by and large. Laughing at Tornado as he necks a beer and smokes a pipe - a gag repeated with Catherine Zetea-Jones - just isn't funny.This tried too hard to work on all levels and largely fails at them all.

139,bad_robot_13,Good entertainment,8,14 December 2005,"The Legend of Zorro (no spoilers) Anytime you offer the premise of a nice looking guy in a black cape flying through the air reminiscent of my beloved vampire Lestat as penned by Anne Rice, you have my attention.It strikes me as odd, though, that Antonio Banderas does seem seven years older, because I'm not, but  hey! even though his hair was better in the first Zorro, he's still easy on the eyes, and oh the boots and shirts can not be beat. All in all he has the essence of Zorro and that's what we're looking for here, folks. Catherine Zeta-Jones delivers attitude that's not too overwrought to be believable in context, and watching her get her petticoats dirty in order to kick some butt is delightful. Both Banderas and Zeta-Jones maintain the continuity of character from the first ""Zorro"" movie, which I believe is notable given the seven year interlude, and thanks are no doubt in order to director Martin Campbell for that accomplishment as well.Perhaps the deepest ideas you can  or should  walk out of this movie with are that entertainment for entertainment's sake is not dead, that cupid bow lips for women never really went out of style, and that men who have hair on their heads should let it grow out past the buzz cut stage. C'mon, in the entirely superficial arena  which I am by no means above  of appreciating the male of the species, let's face it, even Josh Duhamel is more Josh Duhamel when he has longer hair and nothing, but nothing beats Tim Olyphant with fluffy hair.Oops, I just drifted much the same as this movie drifts towards the middle. When the action slows to a stop the dialogue also becomes flat leaving you to search for a plot that seems non-existent at the time. Hey  every movie this long needs an intermission, right? You'll easily recognize this one and if you're smart you'll use the time to get your popcorn and roam freely about the theater for a few minutes. Thankfully, it does regain its pace, so don't leave.When the actors, both human and animal, at least appear to be more involved in generating the action than CGI's I can not only forgive, but also praise the stunt doubles and camera work. To my untrained eye and/or sense of reality the only scene that caused me to consciously think ""CGI"" was one involving the horse and a train.Most of the deliberate cuteness in dialogue is easily forgiven, especially if you've viewed the first ""Zorro"" directed by Martin Campbell and thereby have come to expect it. There are even a couple of times when Banderas' asides deftly and thankfully last not-a-second-too-long. The Lee Marvin reference will not be lost on most of you, and the twist on it is absolutely great.The only scenes in which the word ""Oscar"" came to mind were ones involving the horse. However, 10 year old Adrian Alonso, who had never spoken English prior to this role as Joaquim, is a definite scene stealer at times.There's not a darned thing wrong with walking into a theater with the mission statement ""entertain me"" and having that objective fulfilled. An abundance of extremely well choreographed action scenes propel this movie to high marks on that entertainment scale.",The Legend of Zorro
140,DocRedfield,Decent follow up is at least old-school cool,8,30 October 2005,"As a more than passing fan of the Zorro movies that span the decades, I had been waiting since 1998 for a sequel to Martin Campbell's 'Mask of Zorro.' That movie took much (though not everything) of the best of the various Zorro films, serials, and series and then stole from other sources (such as Dumas 'Monte Cristo', etc) to concoct a sexy, swashbuckling action adventure that had great pacing and strengths, with high production values and actors. Mr. Campbell and those high standards at last return to the story begun, and we now follow our heroes and their son as California fights to join a struggling Union. Zorro's character is not quite so impulsive and cool as he once was, but simply comfortable and ultra-capable, while his wife Elena complains that the man behind the mask knows not who their son is growing up to be. None of these character 'upgrades' felt wrong to me; it was natural extensions of them from the first film, despite how adventurous Elena claims to still be (and for the most part isn't), but it does make the first act of this movie a bit tiresome after the initial (awesome) action sequence. This time, though, as the story and its many plot-points begin to move, the writers borrow heavily from Hitchcock to keep things interesting. It doesn't always work, as there's a lot going on but never QUITE coming perfectly, cohesively together, but ultimately it makes sense and spins a good yarn for the fighting to take over. Meanwhile the stunt coordinators take what has already been done in the best Zorro flicks and then go wild with it, giving us stunts and action of old-school-cool caliber, such as stage-coaches, leaps and horses jumping on to explosive-laden locomotives. Unfortunately there is not quite enough action, and while I do like the over-all story - with its subtle bits of murk and dirty grays underneath the battle of white and black hats - it doesn't actually pace perfectly, giving us bickering Vega family exploits and Zorro failures for a rather large portion of the picture. The sword fights are fewer and more far-between than I would have liked, sometimes degrading to fisticuffs instead of proper dicing, but then the explosions almost make up for it all. The humor is a bit silly, provided mostly by the horse(!!) and the sometimes-annoying kid, but the audience ate it up. The villains are good, if never entirely fleshed out, and the themes are handled well. It's the lag caused by the idea (which I never understood) that 'once a couple gets together they're not interesting anymore' that slows things. Regardless of my small issues, the movie DOES deliver as a Zorro film, (with a good ending, for certain) and while it doesn't completely live up to its predecessor, it is a worthy sequel - just not entirely the direction I would have gone.",The Legend of Zorro
141,loracbau,A good fun movie,8,8 October 2006,"Just saw this on DVD and I thought it was really good - though the loose grasp of California and U.S. history was jarring enough to interrupt the flow(there was no Confederate general in 1850, although there was a rift between the North and the South, never heard of the Bear Flag Point or whatever - the Bear Flag Revolt happened in Sonoma, etc). This is a swashbuckling, romantic dash, and it's not meant to be historical reality (still, some adherence to historical accuracy would be appreciated). It didn't move as well as the first Zorro, but I hope they do a 3rd movie.It definitely delivers with the swashbuckling, fun, adventure, romance. I just wish they hadn't relied so much on special effects, but instead had more scenes of Banderas and Zeta Jones together - it is their chemistry that is so much fun to watch. The kid who played the son was terrific, funny and the storyline with the problems of family vs. being a 'hero' was a great part of it all.All in all, it's a good DVD rental, and it was very good all around.",The Legend of Zorro
142,paverpayer,Worth it for some belly laughs,7,30 October 2005,"I got to see the film on an IMAX screen - and it was big, and loud and gave me some big, loud laughs too. However the action sequences were completely unbelievable (though often funny) and the movie plays even more loosely with real history than most. The year of California's statehood, the civil war, the invention of nitroglycerin, the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, all are messed with to the extent of being completely fictionalized (statehood happened in 1848, Lincoln presidency in 1861, civil war during his presidency, nitroglycerine discovered around 1860 in Paris and not stabilized until 1867) yet all of the action of the movie, which includes elements of each of the above, purportedly happens in 1850. So, it was fun but much more cartoonish than the original. Considering the amount of violence (there is a lot and despite what a prior comment says some people DO die) I am surprised it got a PG rather than a PG13 rating.",The Legend of Zorro
143,Roving_eye,horrible to say the least,1,20 March 2006,"I cannot believe how there are so many decent reviews given to this movie on IMDb. This movie is banal. Every scene is so clichéd that it took me 4 nights to finish this movie, I watched in parts of 20-30 minutes... I couldn't take it longer than that. Highly predictable, uninspiring storyline, lock stock and barrel stereotype characters, poor dialog, over the top laughable stunt scenes...I could go on forever, but I can't waste more time with this movie. A total back flip from the first part. The one thing this movie gets a thumbs up in is putting you to sleep if you have a case of insomnia (it helped me 3 times).",The Legend of Zorro

I can't believe it took 7 years for them to come up with this?? what was up with Zeta-Jones' accent? Why introduce the kid, I felt his character was pointless and added nothing to the story. I saw this movie on a cross-country flight and wished I could've walked out on it. The first movie was terrific but I wouldn't watch this again even if I had to. I don't see movies to make me think, I see movies to enjoy them but this one was not enjoyable.Bad acting + bad writing = bad movie",The Legend of Zorro
145,joekerr,A tarnished legend...,1,2 November 2005,"I first saw ""The mask of Zorro"" on VHS in 1998. I missed it on it's initial theatrical run. And loved it. I am probably not the only person who loved that film. What I loved about that film is it,s similitude with batman (zorro was a major influence as most Batfans know) But as good as it was. The film ends with Don Diego De la Vega dying and Alejandro Murietta/ Alejandro Del Castillo/ Alejandro De la Vega (in the new film) becoming a husband and a father as the Legend of Zorro continues.One of the problem I have with the first film is hero (Diego De la Vega) even if he has a successor is not a very good way to start a film franchise (as it was probably hoped for) If the film had been a final sequel to a film series or a stand-alone film. It would have been great. A man dies, but his legend lives on. The film had an epic quality.The Legend of Zorro is a badly tought sequel to a still born franchise. the raw harshness of the first film. The brutal (but not gratuitous) deaths and the epic quality of the first film are removed and replaced with a Spy kids-style family film antics.Zorro should never have had a family. In Zorro's first written story, he gives up his double life when he removes his mask. Suc actions raise some questions of moral and responsibility. But the main problem I have with Zorro having a family is that, let's face it. Super-heroes are adults playing kids. They are free of responsibility (when in costume) and can do whatever they want. Once they let someone in. They are in a way castrated and lose that element of fantasy. Since that person who they reveal themselves to, will likely judge and confront the hero.In the first film Zorro fought against an oppressive regime. hated by the government loved by the people. A lot of synergy comes from that relationship. The legend of Zorro now enters the Batman&Robin realm. Zorro makes public appearances, kisses babies and shakes hands. He is loved by everyone except criminals who are no match for the local authorities. The reason for such a tonal shift. the film takes place around the time when California joins the united states of America. (I'm not even sure if the year is right) Gone are the oppressor of the past. Now Zorro is more like Batman than political activist. A change that damages the film and the character.The first true action sequences of the first film begins with Zorro saving some men from execution by whipping the gunmen's weapons on their immediate superior. The sequel starts with a cartoonish sequence (Zorro & his son do a lot of back flips) where Zorro tries to recapture the voting ballots for California's addition to the USA. Zorro's horse becomes a real life Jolly Jumper ( France's comic book cowboy, Lucky Luke's horse/side-kick) He smokes the pipe and gets big cartoonish eyes at one point in the film.One of the major differences between Zorro & Batman are the villains they face. While Zorro always battles the corrupt governor and his cohorts. Batman has a rich rogues gallery. Since all of the bad governor's are dead in the sequel. they created new villains. The main one is a corrupt count who is part of a secret society who is planning to destroy America (with soap, someone watched Fight Club before writing this) His side-kicks are a Bald-headed servant (AKA Oddjobb wannabe) and a wooden-teethed Mercenary/Religious freak (He is no Jaws) These guys are pretty tame and lack the personal hatred that the audience and the main characters felt for the first films bad guys.The Legend Of Zorro is the equivalent of Batman & Robin. it's not as bad. But it has the same impact/feel. The film castrates the main character with odd modern day problems (Did I mention that Zorro divorces his wife and has an uneasy relationship with his son because of his work) The edginess and rawness of the first film is gone. And quite frankly, this is not a very good film. Because you can't have a sequel to a grande finale.I don't think we'll see a Zorro 3 anytime soon. I wished they had written the first film like a year-one/batman begins with Antonio Banderas cast as Diego De la Vega. Hopefully they'll leave Our masked hero alone for a few years and bring him back without any useless baggage. And not as a family film, please! And Bring Back Don Diego De La Vega!",The Legend of Zorro
146,lkayhill10,"Boring, tedious, and mediocre",2,30 October 2005,"I do not recommend ""The Legend of Zorro"" because it has a boring, tedious, and mediocre script, which undermines the actors. As we all know, Zorro is an heroic figure who fights for justice and against tyranny in California's beginning days. In this movie, Zorro spends quite a bit of time drunk because of a quarrel with his wife. You might ask yourself why a heroic figure like Zorro would waste so much time in a family-type movie being drunk, and that was our question. By the time Zorro cleaned up his act and dried up, we lost interest and did not care about the outcome of the preposterous plot that was way over the top for that era. Save your money and time.",The Legend of Zorro
147,govenor_phatt,"Not great, but enjoyable sequel",7,25 October 2005,"Just saw this at an Advanced Screening the other day and must admit i was not particularly looking forward to it. Mainly due to the fact that i loved the original. I loved its tongue in cheek campness, its fun and exciting action scenes, and Anthony Hopkins.Thankfully LOZ has 2 out of the 3 (no Anthony Hopkins for obvious reasons) and while the film has clearly been dumbed down and made more ""family friendly"" as with all mainstream Hollywood sequels, it still has Banderas and Zeta Jones clearly having fun with it.True, some of the CGI looks a bit naff, and there is a terribly unnecessary scene with a horse which made me laugh just because i would have cried because of the terrible effect, but the action scenes are action packed and use a fairly minimal amount of it.As for the story there isn't really much to say of it, which is probably why it doesn't live up to its predecessors standards. But it trys well enough.At the end of the day fans of the original Zorro film will probably enjoy this, as long as they don't expect it to be anything other than a fun popcorn sequel.",The Legend of Zorro

I was wrong about one of those assumptions, the ballpark. This film had horrible writing, bellow average fight scenes, and was just too long. While the first one had a good plot and allowed the audience to feel for the characters (particularly Hopkins'), this one has a TERRIBLE plot and there is no connection between the audience and the characters. The worst part of the film however is the running time. The movie just feels like it won't end. I guess the people making this film that since it is technically part of the same genre as Batman Begins that they could make this movie over two hours since it worked for Batman. The difference however is that while Batman needed it's running to time to advance its story (as well as the fact that it was a great film and it really didn't matter how long it went) this one did not. Overall, this movie is something that should be avoided.",The Legend of Zorro

Unlike it's 1998 PG-13 predecessor, ""the Legend of Zorro"" attempts to be a movie for the whole family. But that's not a good thing.One would think with all the sword fighting Zorro gets involved in, someone would die. But no, this ""Family Film"" seeks to remain P.C. for all audiences. From its slap-stick comedy, obvious out comes, and ideas that we've seen time and time again.""The Legend of Zorro"" will fail to entertain those who have a good taste for movies, but will be sustainable to today's modern viewer.

150,tanmaytoraskar,Just another fun movie,6,31 October 2005,"Zorro is back in action. This time he has to manage his family life and the profession he has chosen, which is to rid of evil in the west. A good action packed movie, but this one doesn't live up to the expectations of the first one. Instead this does pull of a few good action sequences, good stunts and good acting.The Swashbuckling hero, Zorro(Antonio Banderas)comes out with great comic sense, he does his expressions and action in a very cool way. His wife Elena(Catherine Zeta-Jones)is very feisty and puts a good life against her husband. The space given between those two is very well done. The stunts are spectacular and a must see, mixed with the action sequences.The only problem I faced while watching this movie was the plot, which proved to slow the movie down and extend it till the end. The dialogs were very nice but didn't seem to be so catchy either.All in all this is a fun action movie and can be enjoyed by the whole family. The first one was more of a better adventure, where this one just dies along till the end. A Good 6.5 out of 10 for this one.",The Legend of Zorro

I think the scenario is a bit less far-fetched than the previous one's. The actors are excellent. Stunts (fights on the top of the train) are great as well.Waiting for the number 3, with old Antonio Banderas handing over to his son (but in the 1860s, it will be hard to have sword duels)...I just have one concern: the bad guy is a French, again, and wants to destroy the young United States. As far as I know, French were among the US best allies in real history.I wonder how long the French are going to pay in movies for their position against the war in Irak (see ""Master and Commander"", where the original English enemy was surprisingly re-baptized French). Hollywood scenarists were known to be more independent in the 1950s, and some of them among the best were blacklisted for that.I'm still waiting for a movie about the (absence of) nuclear weapons and true financial interests in Irak.

153,jayne61385,Not as good as the original,4,7 November 2005,"It started out with promise, but it soon changed into something awkward and inaccurate in a lot of historical facts, which weakened the plot for me. It was also too violent for its PG rating, and deserved a PG-13 rating. California became a state in 1850, which is when this movie is supposed to be... however, they mentioned several times ""the Civil War"" between the states, and how the United States is divided. They also had Confederate soldiers in a couple of scenes. They were ten years ahead of themselves, and also there is a scene when it becomes a state and a man in formal attire signing the official papers looked similar to Lincoln, who didn't become President until 1860. Also it wasn't that easy to get a divorce in 1850, like Elena did. Three months after she kicked her husband out of the house and divorced him, she was engaged to another man, which was highly scandalous, because Catholics didn't remarry at that point without being ex-communicated. It had unbelievable stunts and stupid twists. The plot dragged on for the longest time. So, as you can tell, I really didn't enjoy this movie.",The Legend of Zorro
154,rasinrice,The Legend of Zorro doesn't come close to the first movie,5,26 November 2005,"Being a long time fan of The Mask of Zorro, I suppose I came into the theatre with a bit too high expectations for the sequel, The Legend of Zorro. Even at the beginning of the movie, it was obvious that it wasn't going to contain the same energy the first one had. There were holes in the plot that didn't make sense and other little things that lacked common sense. Elena's reasons for being angry at Alejandro seemed out of place. No matter how hard I picture it, I cannot see Elena's character acting the way she did in this movie. And when Alejandro got drunk, for some reason, I was thoroughly disappointed as if I expected better from his character(I mean, he's Zorro!) Not to mention their son, who was probably the most annoying character (next to the goofy padre). The kid seems to gain all the abilities of his parents by only genes. He fights and flips in the air with the grace of his father, Zorro. And yet he cannot seemed to muster the intelligence to be able to identify his own father, when he is wearing a black outfit and a mere mask. The ridiculous plot the characters are forced through is very disappointing. I found myself laughing at parts I wasn't supposed too because I could no longer take the sheer stupidity of it all.Perhaps, this isn't a most reliable review, but I am a fan who has just been gravely disappointed and it is frustrating. This movie never should have been made.My final evaluation for the movie is that if you are to go, go with the intent of just enjoying a little bit of action with a smart mouth kid and a animated horse. That's all I have to say.",The Legend of Zorro

It's often the kid in the movie that let's one down, but the kid they got to play Zorro's son did a stand up job. The cinematography was pretty good too. The action scenes were very good, as well as some of the dialog.The plot was pretty bad. Most of the time, it made no sense. As the movie progressed, it made less sense. Then they tie the various sub-plots all together fairly neatly... and it still doesn't make sense.That said, what really burned me up was that they completely trashed the spirit of Zorro in the movie. Instead of protecting the Mexican peasants from their imperialist French masters, he's now aiding the imperialist American government to annex California. Since when did Zorro become a Californian? Since when did he take the side of the government? And they completely re-wrote history. The USA TOOK the northern third of then Mexico, including California; the Mexican peasants wanted no part of the Anglos in the US. Oh, not in this version of history. The peasants want to become Americans! Three cheers for Zorro helping our land to be stolen from us by the Anglos!

Not perfect, but at least entertaining. Instead, what we have is apparently Universal Studio's Zorroland Theme Park live, on screen.I'm not expecting even a shred of historical accuracy in something like this, but at least give me the opportunity to have suspension of disbelief. I mean, Kenneth Brannagh's giant steam-powered spider in Wild Wild West was easier to swallow than this sugar-coated tripe ball. Come to think of it, this was not unlike a feature-length version of some Bizarro episode of Wild Wild West we never saw, or perhaps Brisco County, Junior.

My stomach should not turn during a ZORRO movie - this is not supposed to be disgusting - it's supposed to be FUN. This one is fun.It was nice to finally see an action movie with a lot less gore and a lot more humor. It was poking fun at itself - and the entire Western genre ... that's what Zorro is SUPPOSED to do! It's great! The kid steals the movie, but he's worth it. He steals the movie like the kid stole the movie in Jerry McGuire. He's fantastic! But, there is still plenty of Antonio Banderas (he keeps getting better with age) and Catherine Zeta-Jones.

I will save the thin plot and just warn you to skip it if you can.With the PG rating the legend of Zorro is not the Spanish version of Batman anymore he is just a dull character trying to make you laugh and fails desperately in doing it. The downhill of the film is also the role of Zorro's son who is just annoying throughout the picture like stupid scenes where he fights his teacher with rulers like his father does and stupid one liners from day time cartoons.

161,irish-mclean,As fun as movies get!!,10,1 November 2005,"I remember ""The Mask of Zorro"" being the most fun I had at the movies in a while. While other movies were textbook shoot-em-ups, this one had style, charm, humor, action and wonderful music. Here it is 7 years later, and not only is ""Legend of Zorro"" as good as the first, it is better.I had a lot of trouble understanding how all these mainstream reviewers callously slammed this movie, with Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post saying of the first one ""nobody connected with this film -- including Zeta-Jones, Antonio Banderas and director Martin Campbell"" and mentions how this sequel was more of the same. I even heard one reviewer mention how this one lacked the fun of the original. Apparently I'm living in a VASTLY different universe than they are. Either that, or these folks think ""fun"" means translating story directly out of a history book.""Legend of Zorro"" is not supposed to be the pinnacle of plausibility, but sets out to be a stylish, pulpy, witty action movie in homage to the days of yore. In this respect, it accomplishes its mission with flying colors! It has been a while where I have walked out of a theater just glowing with excitement over what I have just seen. The actors/director ""didn't connect"" ?? Every scene had heart, feeling, and in other cases excitement and humor without being stupidly corny. Every scene looked as if it had been given careful attention in every element.It is very difficult to pull off a movie that balances strong humor and action, while still maintaining any sense of heart. Every level of story woven together worked very well. Nothing was too campy or cheesy. Yes, some of it was over-the-top, but nothing exceeded the genre of what it was supposed to be. Antonio Banderas not only has terrific screen presence, but has a strong comic presence as well. The creativity with the jokes and action never quit over the film's 2 hours and 20 minutes.While ""Mask"" was PG-13, ""Legend"" is PG, but don't let that fool you into thinking it is tame. This movie is just as violent and lively as the first one, and perhaps a shade darker. The relationship issues between the 3 main characters are common enough that any age understands them, but realistic enough that adults will relate (on this level it's a great ""rough around the edges"" family film). Make no mistake, this was a hard PG, which I enjoyed since I didn't want to see any letting-up with the plot or action. ""Legend"" is a crowd pleaser in many many respects, and has that same charm as the last Zorro, if not more. I was almost glad the reviews were generally bad, since that inexplicable cynicism lowered my expectations only to have them greatly surpassed by the end of the movie. I can understand this movie not being everyone's cup of tea. But what has happened to American audiences where they can't let down their guards and enjoy the same charm that first made movies the special thing that they are! I guess you'd have to read these cynical reviews to find out. Folks this isn't trying to be ""Citizen Kane,"" it's trying to be Zorro! If people can't appreciate that without criticizing it, they should stick to more serious films.I say this realistically - that ""Legend of Zorro"" was at least as much fun as any time I've had at the movies! Few films have successfully pulled off the old-fashioned charm that these 2 Zorro films have. Martin Campbell very much knows what he is doing with this genre, and I hope he will do good things with ""Casino Royale.""",The Legend of Zorro

At first i was very excited to see they were making a continuation of the first Zorro movie. The Mask of Zorro was an excellent movie. But this sequel just doesn't do it justice. There was too much childish humor and unbelievably unrealistic stunts (i.e. horse jumping onto the train) for this film to really grab my attention.

Obviously you may wonder why I went to see it at all and the simple reason is that I loved the first movie, and my personal motto is never trust the critics as I almost always disagree.This film proved me right! Action, romance and humour were all in abundance and my friends and I particularly found the Padre and Joaquin comical characters to the film. Many good lines from the old priest including 'I'll see you in confession my child' to a cheeky maid and many quips from the cute son of Zorro, those two characters stopped the film from being dull and made it fun to watch for all ages.A delightfully delicious Antonio Banderas as the swashbuckling hero and the beautiful CZJ were a perfect couple, a classic love/hate relationship containing many disagreements that made them all the more realistic and endearing to the audience. As a classic action & swashbuckler fan, the film was a joy for me and it had a great mix of all genres. Even one or two moments were truly terrifying to my friends & I, thanks to an atmospheric soundtrack and chilling villain, played by Rufus Sewell.This film is good fun and should no be missed just because some people are too uptight to see the love and joy it brings.",The Legend of Zorro

While some terrorists try to prevent that no matter what. Terrorist who appear to be - but we leave that out until after you've seen the movie.Martin Campbell sets his second ""Zorro""-movie ten years after the the first one when Don Alejandro and Elena married. And as in most marriages things you loved so much about your partner start to stress you out. Why can't Zorro (Antonio Banderas) just stay with his wife Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones)? Doesn't he see that his son needs him as much as the poor people in the neighborhood? When Don Alejandro de la Vega prefers his job & career as Zorro one time to often to his wife and family, Elena finally files for divorce. And how handy it comes that there's this eloquent, attractive new kid in town - a french noble, Mrs de la Vega falls for. Or are things different than they appear?""The Legend of Zorro"" is a good example why movie theaters these days suffer from less and less ticket buyers. Campbells wants to have a wide target audience so bad - he created a humorous movie with notions of ""Batman"" as much as of James Bond and with a slight ""DaVinci Code"" feel in it. There's so many references to what people appeared to like in here you barely notice an uniqueness of this movie. Or is the none anyway? And yes, the movie is far away from being boring or not entertaining - but why watch this movie instead of any other blockbuster, you won't be able to tell.It fits that, while Banderas and Zeta-Jones give very slick performances, the most memorable actors are kid (but don't let them confuse you: Adrian Alonso is not the new Marlon Brando) and a horse that likes to have a smoke and a wine every now and then.A movie you want to see at home on DVD on a rainy autumn night, but you won't miss anything if you miss this at the cinema.",The Legend of Zorro

It is so bad, the movie makes no sense. They have combined Civil War (1861-1865) with California becoming a state--that never happened. California was a state way before the Civil War was a reality. They even have the wrong American flag when they signed the paper making California a state. There are so many mistakes that make this movie a total complete fiasco. Maybe the makers of the movie should have made this movie an 'alternate history' movie; even that would not save this movie. This movie was just horrible. As a movie, this tries to make Zorro a legend. He and his wife undergo a divorce and here reality takes a complete leap into unbelievability. Divorce did not exist back then as it does today. Divorced, his wife works for the Pinkertons as an undercover agent for the U.S. government. In reality, Pinkerton was a private detective agency and did not work for the U.S. government at this time; it only worked for the U.S. about 12 years later during the Civil War. Zorro exposes the nefarious plot, saves the day, and helps California to become a state. The railroad was not as big back then, and not big at all until after the Civil War when the Continental railroad system was made in the 1870's. Even using the Henry rifle in California was wrong. The stunts do not save this mess; even Antonio and Catherine were not able to save it. The original 'Mask of Zorro' was better than this mess.",The Legend of Zorro

Others thought that the story wasn't serious or special as the first film.The first film was about the continuation of the Zorro legacy,the follower dealing with revenge versus duty,a father has to fight the ''father'' of this daughter,etc.While all of this is very nice,the story here is much more humane.It's about a man who tries to balance his life,be a good person and at the same time do what is best for him,and for the world.That's a story that I want to see.That's a story that can teach me a lot. So,with a great story,great characters,great action and great music,this is the best,most romantic her film ever made... ...in my opinion,at least. :)",The Legend of Zorro
167,miteafrodite,Zorro a bunch of Zzzzzzz's? Not so much!,9,8 November 2005,"I genuinely LIKED this movie. In response to some of the previous reviews...* The kid was not that annoying...he was fun, if not overly-acrobatic. Thats plausible, not genetically, but because he idolizes Zorro. Haven't you ever played superhero in the backyard? * Alejandro and Elana are SUPPOSED to be older, its been 10 years! (Don Diego was a far older Zorro in the first flick). * Yes there are glaring historical inaccuracies and they have all been mentioned, so I won't go into them and, yes, only history buffs would spot the inaccuracies...sadly, most Americans don't know squat about their own history. * Yes the horse is over the top with the comic relief...but I loved the direct homage to ""Cat Ballou."" Braving that much flame and leaping fantastically...hey, this is Zorro's horse! * Um...the English were the 'good guys' in ""Master and Commander"", not the 'bad guys'. England was at war with America (1812!) and the French were allied with America, hence the French were, correctly, the 'bad guys'. The homework was actually pretty darned flawless on that film. * Alejandro and Elena had a BOY at the end of ""Mask of Zorro"" (""Sleep well, my son."")...the baby girl was Elena at the beginning. If you didn't catch that, you missed a major plot point in BOTH films. * Zorro was always an action-packed serial film character...in fact, he IS an 'hispanic version of Batman.' Only family murdered, bent on revenge, trains himself to be a weapon against injustice using only his skill (no guns), masquerades as a wealthy gentleman/businessman, fights crime after dark all dressed in black, and uses gimmicks to strike fear into his enemies. * That was NOT supposed to be Abe Lincoln. That was a common look back then even before he became president, and that guy was too short! It was more likely the governor's aid. That said...I did have a few production peeves...* I was glad to see Tony Amendola return in the second film, but he didn't die in the first one as I recall...billing him as Don-Luiz-turned-priest/teacher would have actually made him funnier, rather than billing him as a completely different character. * I'm not Catholic but even I know divorce wouldn't happen like that. And re-marriage?!? Anullment,...maybe. * Cutting the new mask was a great touch, but badly done. The fabric was too short to wrap the way it did and the tears/cuts were too perfect...would have made more sense to have burned the holes with a cigar dropped by a bad guy. (Nitpicky, I know.) * The cartoon eyes on the horse were silly. He could have reacted more naturally...frantically backing up, tossing his head, maybe even backing up and falling into the other car. * Alejandro very obviously had very curly hair in the first film. Hair just doesn't go from naturally kinky to stick-straight even in 10 years time (but, hey, it did look sexy! ;-> ). * Taking the name De la Vega was a nice touch, but even in the guise of a Don, he was already known as Alejandro De Castillo, recently come from Spain. How could they explain the link to De la Vega who supposedly died in prison decades earlier without compromising Zorro's identity? Everyone knew Elena as Raphael Montero's daughter, not Diego's. Even the previous movie's credits list her as Elena Montero/Murietta. * I thought the racist comments and religious fanatic overtones of McGivens should have either been left out completely or the character's personality given more background to explain it. He made a great villain, but the lack of motive made it seem gratuitous. * Boy, the priestly life must be pretty healthy...it obviously took about 10 years off Fray Felipe. Couldn't they have just made him a different priest, handed down the secret of Zorro from the older one? * The polo match was funny, but in 1850 it was still customary to challenge a gentleman to a duel with sword or pistols. It would have been nice to see an extra sword fight in there...especially between a deadly villain and someone trying hard NOT to be Zorro for a day.Things other reviewers failed to appreciate...* This is an action movie...not Masterpiece Theatre. Its a good, light, entertaining swashbuckling popcorn movie in the same vein as ""Pirates of the Caribbean""...suspend your disbelief at the door and enjoy the ride! Its an homage to the early serial movies...like ""The Mummy"" and ""Indiana Jones"", and just as enjoyable. * I completely got the plot. Were some people just catching the z's through this thing? How could you not get the plot? I can believe an Illuminate-style secret power trying to incite an early North/South conflict...made perfect sense to me. * The relationship stuff (except for the speedy 19th century Catholic divorce) was actually the best part to me. Hey, it worked for Mary Jane/Peter Parker in ""Spiderman II"". I thought it was great and the characters had more than enough depth for an action movie.Bottom line...I paid full price to see this TWICE...not because I'm a Banderas, Zeta-Jones, or Sewell fan...I wanted to see an entertaining, good-old-fashioned swashbuckling adventure flick with nasty villains, great costumes, beautiful scenery, romantic tension, sword fighting, a little comic relief, and a climactic yet happy ending. There's nothing wrong with a family-friendly film. Isn't that what the old serials were all about? PS: I gave it less than a perfect 10 because the writers didn't do their homework. It peeves me when a good movie is panned in reviews about historical inaccuracies when all it would take is a little Google to prevent it.",The Legend of Zorro
168,AmaZingen,funny but less charming,8,29 October 2005,"OK, so The legend of Zorro (TLOZ)wasn't as bad as I taught it would be. It certainly is better than The Mummy Returns and the kid was very good. He was funny and cute and his presence in the movie was ,somehow, useful than the kid from The Mummy Returns.I guess you could say that this movie was OK but the first one (""the mask of Zorro"") was even better. Although some might think that it was awkwardly peculiar that the kid did not recognize his own father (when he is Zorro) is not at all surprising, for me. I mean ""Why don't people recognize Superman?"" He doesn't even wear a mask.There are also not so much memorable scenes, unlike the first one. But this one is funnier than the first, Specially Elena and the Horse ""Tornado"". The difference I guess is that ""the mask of Zorro"" had more wit than this one , and yet, the sword fighting and stunts in TLOZ is much more exciting. They (TLOZ and TMOZ) had the same background music and intro which is ,I guess, the best idea rather than change it.All in all I think they made a good sequel. It had a different approach... I mean really different...and was able to keep me on my seat...Elena: ""not bad""Zorro: ""not bad at all""",The Legend of Zorro
169,mtripka,Good story but some MAJOR historical boo-boos,7,7 November 2005,"OK, it's fiction but a ""historical fiction"" should get its history right. I'm surprised the site didn't list the following as ""goofs"":1. A key component of the plot involves the ""Confederate Army"" and references are made to the ""Confederate States"". This story takes place in 1850 and certainly at that time there was already a looming crisis between North and South, however there was no ""Confederate"" anything until 1861. 2. California being welcomed to the Union by Abraham Lincoln in 1850? Lincoln was not elected President until 1860.3. ""We're Pinkertons--Federal agents"": Alan Pinkerton was the first head of the Secret Service but that agency was not founded until 1862. Only then, and briefly after the Civil War, would ""Pinkertons"" have been federal agents. For the rest of its history the Pinkerton Detective Agency has been a private company. BTW I looked it up and the Pinkerton Detective Agency was not even founded until 1852.",The Legend of Zorro
170,owenloverr,A great movie for the whole family!!,10,24 February 2006,"The Legend of Zorro was an wonderful movie! I loved it, and highly recommend it for any family.The violence in it was comical, and not scary at all, and the actors all did wonderful jobs. Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones made the movie a real keeper, and I thought that the Spanish accents that all the characters had were charming.The plot was excellent with lots of comical relief, and I'm talking funny humor that most people like. For a sequel it was very entertaining, and I understood the plot without ever having seen the first movie.If you're looking for a clean, family movie, or just an all-out hilarious romantic comedy, The legend of Zorro is right for you!",The Legend of Zorro

Here's the story Alejandro a.k.a Zorro is fighting crime until...him and his wife start having marital problems, then they get a divorce, Alejandro is heart broken and things start to happen, Then witch he stops being Zorro...Except for one last ride.I think that this movie (not written by previous writers,because were busy on pirates of the Caribbean) is definitely not the best but okay. it has action & adventure but it lacks in what the first one had...realism.My Conclusion is to see the movie and be the judge.",The Legend of Zorro
172,kyla-j-breed001,i enjoyed this movie,10,24 March 2006,I really liked this movie.Antonio Banderas played Zorro better in this film than he did in the mask of Zorro. I really liked how we saw Catherine Zeta-Jones do more action and get into the movie better. Adrian Alonso played the son of Zorro with great Zorro like comedy and action.This movie had great action and passion. The villain's idea to take over the world was great.The bar of soap was a genius plan but Zorro wouldn't let that happen.I really thought that the would not get back together and it was a wonderful movie for the family.,The Legend of Zorro
173,whipwarrior,Zorro rides again!,10,29 October 2005,"The Legend of Zorro is as perfect as a sequel can possibly be. Well-balanced in action and humor, it brought back everything I loved about the first one in spades. Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones return to their characters in top form, with a storyline that maintains the screw-tightening suspense that a good cliffhanger should offer. Visually, the film is beautiful. The producers revisited the Mexican locales where Mask of Zorro was shot, giving its successor a fresh and vibrant palette of continuity. The stunt and action sequences are framed with thrilling cinematography that had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Finally, James Horner's phenomenal score kept the fire burning, and left me on an adrenaline high as the closing credits rolled. Zorro rides again!",The Legend of Zorro
174,Spearhead_Films,An awful sequel to a great original,3,25 October 2005,"I saw an advance screening of this film last night in the United Kingdom. After seeing the trailer my expectations were low, the film was much, much worse. It is shocking that after the quality and fun we saw in the 'original' it has turned into this trash. Banderas looks chubby, has a double chin and doesn't even try to hide it. The story is pathetic and all over the place. Rufus Sewell, normally excellent is dire as a French aristocrat. All the secondary characters are useless, even the priest was poor with no attempt to hide his accent.This film lacked the story, acting, fun or style of the original. It looks like a poor TV movie, especially when compared to the first. Avoid at all costs!",The Legend of Zorro
175,swilhelm73,Completely disappointing,1,4 March 2006,"The Mask of Zorro was a pleasant surprise. I gave the movie a chance only when it came on TV, and found it to be a comedic action-adventure that worked - something Hollywood often attempts and rarely succeeds with.The Legend of Zorro fails completely at both elements. The humor is scarce, and the over reliance on ludicrous acrobatics just ruins the action.The plot itself makes little sense as Zorro takes on a religious zealot, a European noble seeing to conquer the world for his secret society, and swashbuckling Confederates...in 1850. Had they thrown in an early NAZI or two the film could have completed the Hollywood stereotypical villain roster.The acting proves to be poor across most of the board - Antonio Banderas is obviously not into the role this time and Rufus Sewell is completely wasted. Catherine Zeta-Jones proves the best of the lot with a mere average performance.",The Legend of Zorro
176,tlarndt,This should have been a cartoon,3,25 March 2006,"As a boyhood fan of the original stories of Zorro, I have been extremely disappointed with the last two movies that have been trotted out. The spirit and tradition of Zorro has been lost, especially in this last, overly politically correct, incarnation. This was more like a James Bond film than a Zorro picture. The producers seem to have forgotten that Zorro was the inspiration for Batman. A dark secretive character who works at night to fight injustice. Apparently this was not enough for a plot that included world domination, evil henchmen and precocious kids. This film completely missed the mark. I look forward to a real movie about Zorro.",The Legend of Zorro

His private investigation of his former wives new husband unravels a devious plot.When I saw the opening scene in this movie, I knew that this film would ruin my Sunday afternoon. It's hard to point out any distinct, major reasons for this feeling, but I'll try to give you a short and drastically compromised selection of some.-When I go to see a movie I expect to be at least briefly challenged or puzzled as to what might come next in the plot. When I went to see this movie, I was obviously expecting way too much.-A movie with cultural integrity can be excused for a 2+ hours duration. When over 50% of the movies scenes could be removed with minor interference to both the plot or the artistic value, it usually is for the best to shorten the movie.-The humor was misplaced and outright cheap. This is a very grim comnination.-An actionmovie should have better action. There was no nerve whatsoever in the actionsequences in this picture.I could go on for pages, but I doubt it would make for any good reading. The saddest thing is that this film probably will become a blockbuster and make lots of money.

Zorro has ever been conflicted with eternal problems, and Zorro was never created to be dark. This film takes Zorro back to his roots, with humor and action of this quality,who cares if the plot isn't historically accurate. People feel that Zorro plots should be limited by historical accuracies, Zorro is treated unfairly by these viewpoints. Plots for heroes or superheroes, such as Batman or Spiderman, can be as far-fetched as the writer wishes without public hatred for it. But when it comes to Zorro, a character originally created to incite the same feelings as a 1960's Batman cartoon, everyone is like ""Oh noes, the historical inaccuracies.""

You'll enjoy this movie if you like 1980s Spielberg action flicks -- think Indy Jones mixed with Hook and a dash of Spaghetti Westerns thrown in.Although it is PG -- there is some serious violence that I found a bit much for a ""family"" flick.Overall the screening audience seemed to enjoy it, while only my section laughed at most of the jokes.",The Legend of Zorro

OK, so Zorro and Elena had a son and settled into a comfortable life in one of the biggest mansions I've ever seen. Instead of the fiery characters that I expected, I saw a desperate housewife and a drunken quitter. I understand that the writers wanted to create a conflict between the two main characters but couldn't they have shown a little more imagination and not given us such idiotic stereotypes. Although far-fetched, the action was the only thing that made this movie bearable. There were a few funny lines but on the whole this movie was strained and exhibited totally unimaginative dialogue. And another thing, I understand there was never a Zorro so I didn't expect historical accuracy but it was too much to place Lincoln in California at the ceremony of California's entering the union during the Civil War. When did he have time to go there, did he take Air Force One? Too bad, with characters like Diego and Elena this movie could have been much better.",The Legend of Zorro

As for the first, I thought it was a little boring, and while this one is a little more entertaining, it is also much cheasier. The action completely makes fun of its self and there are many things in the movie that only children would think is funny. All in all, I did good to sit through this movie. The acting was OK, and the dialogue was tolerable at most. Antonio is really showing his age in this movie, but as for catherine, she is more beautiful than ever.

There is no entertaining revenge plot in this film. The film has been dumbed down into a family friendly adventure. The cool chemistry between Antonio Bandares and Catherine Zeta Jones is severely lacking in this film. Instead of being passionate lovers, they are mostly depicted as bickering parents in order to serve the film's mediocre plot. This films plot is so silly by involving a French count trying to destroy the U.S. with explosive soap. Besides being stupid, the films plot is also historically inaccurate. I usually don't like to identify historical inaccuracies with movies set in history because it can be considered nitpicking. However, this film's plot is grossly inaccurate. For instance, there was no Confederate army in 1850 because there was no civil war then. While there are many bad points in this film, there are also a few good points. One of these good points is the films villain played by British actor Rufus Sewall. He is the mark of a true actor by being able to disappear into different characters, usually villains. He has the charm of a James Bond villain and definitely deserved to be in a better film playing a better character. Overall, this film is a drastic bore.

While the film does take some vast liberties with American history, the concept is imaginative and acts as a neat vehicle for the films pyrotechnic exploits.I enjoyed it, even if it did seem to run a bit long.

Better than the first. After reading the pre-comments I thought this one was going to be aimed at the little kiddies, and not the big kids in us all. Good villains #1 and #2; the adult themes of racism and politics well handled.Tornado is also pronouced correctly, unlike the first one (TorNaydoe!). It has to be Torr nah doh! And he has a lot to do, looking dashing sprinting by the train etc! The action and wit is also better. The previous one sort of bogged down in the end, with the scenery (a mine, zzzzzzzzzzzzz). Also the hand to hand combat a welcome addition. Even the Zorro kid's scene with the teacher is funny, without being slapstick (again, my big fear going in).The only negative is the lack of lip hair. It's as much of Zorro as the flashing teeth.Music also doesn't disappoint. I'm not much for Zeta-Jones, but she's OK. As Mrs Zorro she also handles her action scenes well.After the first one I wrote Banderas a big hurrah; and I'm glad to see he listened to me to make a second one and keep close to the legend of the mask!

The mini-me Zorro son was fine with me also and got lots of laughs from the audience. Good villains and great scenery from San Luis Potosi in Mexico. Good stunts especially with the horse.

I don't think I've ever seen such a load of anachronisms all put together in one place. They are too numerous to mention, but the most important and appalling ones can be found in the goofs section.The plot lacks almost any connection with something interesting and related to the Zorro legend. There is only one scene with Zorro helping people in trouble. He only carves a single Z in his opponents. And the meta plot completely dominates the anachronistic and weird story of Zorro's family life - and they do not achieve anything worth mentioning with the attempt at a father-son plot line, which could have been developed into something worth watching.There are no puns or other witty remarks during sword fights - and they are for the most part so unrealistic that it's annoying. Speaking of realism, the characters are either unrealistic or stereotypes - when they're not out of character, which is where most of the persons spend the most of the film. I don't blame the actors - I blame the writers.All this I could have endured if there had been but a small trace of that Zorro charm that The Mask of Zorro depicted. But there was none left. Banderas as Puss in Boots in Shrek II had more Zorro in it than this load of anachronisms. It's not worth anyone's time.It's a sorry excuse for a film.",The Legend of Zorro

I thought the Confederate States existed from 1861 to 1865.(2) At the end of the movie (CA becomes a state) wasn't that Abe Lincoln (minus the beard)? I thought he was a relatively unknown log-splitter from IL when this film was supposed to take place.(3) Why was the chief bad guy (the one with the Cross stamped on his face) remarkably like a fundamentalist Christian? I guess the Christians were troublemakers even then. And they also made him a Southerner.(4) Where did that train come from?

Zeta-Jones, still radiant, yet, we know she is already a mother. So, instead of romantic love, this film is themed more like 'family' love, or husband and wife love. They quarrel because Zorro doesn't give enough time and care to his family and son. Family or career? Contemporary men have to choose and balance them. Zeta-Jones, having been a traditional wife and mother, is becoming a career woman, although her reason is still partly for her husband. Is this something new for this type of period film? And the clergyman in the movie: he is a good guy and he is quite secularized. However, somehow, he reminds me of those clergymen who committed 'sexual sins', who abused children.The actions were kind of old-fashioned, but still attractive, because the quality is still there.And I love Zeta-Jones' earrings.

193,jlcTheFox,A legend preserved.,10,19 April 2006,"Can anyone say Diebold?What is Zorro suppose to be? What is a movie suppose to be? A truly human experience, involving important issues, sometimes pressing issues, sometimes universal issues, and sometimes both. ""How exactly does a flaming poker fit into your little theory?"" the teacher inquires. ""It fits!"" Joaquin says confidently, adding quietly, ""In your butt."" There is nothing more funny than the truth.Scene after scene there appear current 2005 issues. The first is the appearance of McGivens. Who does he look like? George somebody. George W. uh, uh, oh yeah, Bush. He has the most technologically advanced weapon in his hands and he is using it to blow the hats off people here and there. I guess that got everybody's attention. His face has an ugly looking scar on the right side in the shape of a religious cross! What does he do next? He tries stealing the votes. Fortunately this movie has ""Zorro"" who returns the ballots. How does this issue, escape anybody's attention? I'm sure it didn't. The total silence is replaced by criticism that is vehemently taken to the extreme; a heartless, cold criticism of irrelevant issues and often straight lies, like familiar political smear campaigns not acknowledging the real issues but discrediting their detractors.Another reference to real issue appears, in the form of Zorro's wife. She is a spy whose cover is threatened. Hum. Valerie Plame outing similarly is ""...an acceptable loss."" This is particularly similar, except this outing isn't a political pay back! Then we see her literally uncovering a highly advanced electronic message receiver that Armand's secret organization has hidden. This is similar to the secret electronic spying used ""illegally"" against its people, attacking our liberty.Here is a parallel I'm not sure was intended, but I rather think it was, in any case it is surely interesting. Zorro reveals the maps. It is the United States today. Then he turns to the map that is truly important showing the tracks. Immediately the voice coming from Armand says, ""There can be no mistakes!"" Goodbye, Dan Rather! The document that you happened to show was a fake. Never mind that it is irrelevant, you made a mistake. You were revealing important true facts; we can't have that, so, this way please. And too for the sloppy movie, not only is ""The Legend of Zorro"" a bad movie, it is the worst movie of the year and maybe ever. Movie goers must dismiss this movie from any possible plans.How blatant are these references? The war plans include a ""preemptive attack"" using state militia, dividing our country. The universal moral issue here of a preemptive strike, and specifically Bush's doctrine is in question. Need I explain the immorality of the unprovoked attack on Iraq? And should I point out the ensuing civil war as a result of meddling in their affairs and the insanity of their similar plans?There is more. What is this secret society? Are we to believe that there could be a group who makes advance plans for world domination? Make me laugh again. The secret ""Knights of Aragon"". It can't be real! Have you ever heard of PNAC, ""The New American Century"" or the ""Knights of the Golden Circle"". No? And these are not even that secret! They are only kept out of the press as much as possible, next to the funnies.Interesting too it is that George, I mean, McGivens is not the mastermind but a killer hired by Armand to do the dirty work. Of course we couldn't expect that from someone with his intelligence. McGivens can't even threaten Armand for fear of having his tongue cut out and fed to the dogs.How did this movie get made in the political climate of 2005? It was disguised as pure fiction. This brings us back to the original question. Zorro is an inspiration to the oppressed. Standing up to authorities and exposing corruption and like a fox getting away with discovery. I laugh when other critics say the movie supports the war on terrorism. Neither Zorro nor Elena willingly was involved in fighting terrorism. Elena was outright forced by the Pickertons and Zorro was only concerned for Elena's safety after the explosion on Armand's property. Homeland security was an issue, but the real threat was a civil war caused by our own leaders.Needless to say that I already have been accused of being a wild eyed conspiracy freak. Like President Jimmy Carter? These are facts kept out of the main media, until now. After rolling my eyes in astonishment from listening to the pathetic criticism meant to blow away the movie, I sit dumbfounded. What do people want to see when coming to see a Zorro movie? Some point to the noble first movie, ""The Mask of Zorro"", and say a swashbuckling adventure hour. No harm in that, except that is not very ambitious. This is aptly demonstrated in ""The Legend of Zorro."" The action was more spectacular than ever, near to the point of numbness. By inserting the human heart and intelligent substantive issues, a higher goal was showcased and a legend was preserved.",The Legend of Zorro

When they made the legend of Zorro, the mask of Zorro was put to shame. The story of the movie sucked! This movie was unnecessary. The producers should be a shamed of their selves. The movie started in a town in California and the crowd was cheering Zorro. They were voting on choosing free state of slaved state. Of course, the bad guys came and interrupted the excitement. Zorro came and then there was a fight seen. In the end of the movie Zorro was fighting the person who stared all of the drama and won. As I said the, The movie is lame.",The Legend of Zorro
195,willielovekim,Better Than The First,9,24 March 2006,"This is a movie which was incredibly well done. The new villain was right out of the old ""Wild Wild West"". The continuity errors were a little intriguing: References to a ""Confederate Army"" in 1850 when the states didn't secede until 1861 and showing a Henry Repeating Rifle at least 10 years prior to its existence while no one carries a Colt Revolver which did exist at the time is rather odd. The performance by Antonio Banderas as Zorro vexed by the 2 sides of his existence was wonderful. The depiction of the ""chinatown"" area where acupuncture takes place was also interesting. The polo/joust sequence was rather funny. Ebert focused on the marital argument aspect of the scenes between Zorro and Elena; this is the same critic who also thought Moulin Rouge should have been best picture. Moulin Rouge was fun; but in an Ed Wood kind of way not because it was good. The legend of Zorro was a pleasant evening's diversion for my fellow classmates and I and I hope there will be more movies by this team on this great story line.",The Legend of Zorro

I was well pleased with the resolution of this movie I also liked the fact that it was serious and comical at the same time. I am also pleased with the fact that I actually got an important moral or at least that this show had a moral and was well enveloped around the family. Overall I would say that this is a good show and this critic liked it. Although there are still some negatives to this show. My biggest negative was that some parts of this movie was very boring and if it was not for my want to see the ending I would have probably fallen asleep.

I understand the fact that he is a hero, but some of his stunts were unrealistic! He should have been killed by the first half of the movie. I liked his son, Joaquin and his wife was pretty. I also liked how she kept her secret identity when she was with the bad guy. I don't think that she had to divorce Alexjandro just to keep her cover, though. I think that the bad guy's idea of transporting the exploding liquid was also unrealistic because it was supposed to be back in the early 1900's, and they didn't have that back then.",The Legend of Zorro

Elena is blackmailed by American agents to divorce Alejandro and spy on the man who loved her before Alejandro married her. So thus, Zorro is going the man and keeps in her at the same Joaquin thinks his dad doesn't care about and this starts the adventure. The movie his filled with frantic sword fighting and exciting explosions. The story is decent with a little bit of bad acting, but has hilarious content now ant then.

The fighting scenes kind of scared me but, it was very exciting and the movie couldn't be a Zorro movie without some action now would it? Anyway, the little boy in the movie was really funny except there were times when he said some very mature dialogue and was always trying to fight some grown person. what made me laugh was that the little boy got in trouble with the teacher in which the teacher was going to beat him with a belt but, ended up being beaten by the little boy. Some parts in the movie made me sad like the part when Zorro was trying to save this family but, ended up saving the just two of the people in the family.

202,diannecf,When bad plots happen to good characters,7,24 March 2006,"I think the chemistry with the main characters was great. Elena and Alejandro (Zorro) continued with their struggles, just as you see in the first film. Again there are miscommunications verging on the tragic. This time, however, the little boy Joaquin is caught up in them.I found this so very Latin. The child is disrespectful to the priest, but still somehow a good little Catholic (a paradox which only those deeply dyed in the religion can understand). He's a scamp, but so full of romantic intensity (frequently embraced by his overwhelmingly sexy mother), that you know this is just a little Zorro in embryo, fully his father's son. And there is a lot of affection there. It is the Italian churches which have all the Saint Anthony's and St. Joseph's, holding a child. This is some deep pagan thing. The Roman father publicly came forward to acknowledge his own son. Zorro has many scenes in which this intense relationship of father and son is played out. I think there is even one where Zorro is holding his son while fending off others with his sword or whip.Sometimes the father appears weak and defeated. He gets drunk. But then he pulls himself together and prevails. He and his horse are a great comic pair, which makes me think of Don Quixote somehow.The family must come to terms with what is the family business, and that father may be summoned with the peal of a churchbell at any time. Like the priest himself, he is dedicated to a higher calling than his own arrangements. Nevertheless, mother can fight when she has to.The great weakness of the film is the villains, who are fairly ridiculous. In fact both Zorro pictures had cartoonish villains, with really flimsy schemes to do wrong. I'm not sure why this bothers me. Maybe it is because I agree with Ayn Rand's idea about James Bond - that he shouldn't be a figure of fun in the end. Zorro does stand for great things, and he should at least have more worthy adversaries than the equivalent of Dr. Evil types. There is something discordant in the films where these rather weird and laughable villains actually meet horrible ends as their comeuppance. Buffoonery veers into Blood Meridien.Just as you can laugh at Bond's British type of humor, but on some level take his missions seriously - you can laugh at Zorro's domestic tiffs and miserable hangovers, but in the end you have to realize that the small ranchers really need an advocate, a champion. I guess I disagree with Rand here: Robin Hood or Zorro is a perfectly worthy hero in my book, because the people they are up against for the little guy are out to rob them of all dignity, in the course of seizing their property or even their children, and such a hero is there to restore it.Zorro has virtue. Perhaps in the end that is what many critics could not forgive. I am distressed that Roger Ebert hated it so much. He did not say why. That's the problem with a really severe pan. They don't break it down into its parts. Perhaps it's the easier path.",The Legend of Zorro

Nothing more either, but who's complaining... For a rainy afternoon I find it's a great movie! Missing of course it the best actor ever: Anthony Hopkins. He really gave the first Zorro movie it's pizazz. But Banderas is a very sympathetic Zorro, just as he was in part 1. Nice touch: the son. Zorro age 8. Very talented young actor, I suppose the next Zorro movie will be called ""The son of..."".

When the real stories behind all three are so interesting, why did they have to twist it all up so much???Inventions show up before they were invented. California becomes a state at the time of the confederacy instead of a decade earlier, the Pinkertons show up a year before the company was founded (if you go by the vote on the California Constitution happening when it really did, in 1849,) and the provisional Yankee military government that was in place from the end of the Mexican-American War until the 1850 statehood is not portrayed at all.It would be better if the screenwriters had stuck with pure fantasy.",The Legend of Zorro

If this were sci-fi that would be OK, but the whole thing was so silly that I couldn't take anything else in the movie very seriously. This was too bad, since the action sequences and the chemistry between Zeta and Banderas was nice. The first Zorro movie also had some historical inaccuracies, but so obscure that it was no big deal. Especially annoying were the typical confederate stooge-types working for the bad guy. I know Hollywood hardly ever gets history right, but rarely does it get history so wrong.",The Legend of Zorro
206,NoMisandry,"Zorro, Little Zorro and his amazing wife?",1,6 January 2008,"***Contains Spoilers*** This movie is not about Zorro.It is about his amazing nagging wife Elena and their retarded brat of a son. From the very beginning of the movie Zorro is belittled and emasculated constantly by his wife, his son, the Pinkertons, etc. His spoiled son tells him -- sometime near the end of the film -- ""You don't deserve mom."" We also get bombarded with politically correct dogma; such as Elena -- who although the daughter of a noble -- seems to have just as much skill in wielding a sword as Zorro. He carves a 'Z', she carves an 'E.' The ""10-year old son"" is also an amazing swashbuckler that is just as skilled as his dad.I suppose the next films are going to be called ""The Mask of Elena the nagging wife"" and ""Legend of Elena and her spoiled son."" I mean come on with the ""women can be heroes too"" ideology. If a woman wants to be a hero she should do so in ""her own movie."" I don't want to turn on Zorro and feel like I am watching another version of that horrible film Charlie's Angels.Zorro is constantly placed in the position of being the ""henpecked husband"" by Elena. She tells him ""follow me"" and he says ""always"" as she leads the adventure. Wait a minute I thought this was ""ZORRO"" not ""Elena?"" I hear tons of women saying Catherine Zeta-Jones was stunning and Antonio Banderas was not but one can easily see that all of Catherine Zeta Jones shots have been doctored(i.e. Each shot has a haziness effect to it) while Banderas' shots are taken as is. Also, it has been reported that Zeta-Jones has had plastic surgery. In my opinion , and possibly the opinion of those not motivated by misandry , Antonio Banderas looks fine. He looks natural whereas Catherine does not.I really don't see why they spent so much time on the son he was a worthless add-on with a big mouth and little to no respect for authority. The horse scenes were kind of funny, but they got way out of hand and ended up helping this film to its deathbed. The critics slew this film and now I see why. The main fall backs they cite is Elena, the son, and the dumbing down of Zorro.Next time try to make a good movie rather than a political statement concerning gender.",The Legend of Zorro

There are Pinkertons, wow its just bad I'm not sure what else to say. I would write more, but I am honestly getting a head ache thinking about it.

208,klossner9,Script elements from notorious,5,1 November 2005,"I have not read many reviews or comments on The Legend of Zorro, so perhaps this has already been discussed by others. Has anyone else noticed that the screenplay resembles the Alfred Hitchcock classic Notorious (1946)? In both films, the heroine is forced by nasty American government agents to become romantically involved with the villain, in order to spy on him. In Notorious Ingrid Bergman actually marries villain Claude Rains; in LZ Catherine Zeta-Jones does not have to go that far. In Notorious the man who loves the heroine (Cary Grant) is one of the spies who forced her to marry the villain; in LZ the hero does not force the heroine to do anything and he's indignant that the government forced her. In Notorious the Nazi villain is probably more in love with the heroine than the hero is; in LZ they don't explore that. Other similarities  The villains are European aristocratic, totalitarian conspirators who are plotting against America  Nazis in Notorious, a screwball secret society in LZ. The villains work in a Spanish-speaking area of the Western Hemisphere (Argentina in Notorious, recently- Mexican California in LZ), but everybody in the film actually speaks English. The villains have a secret weapon  uranium for an atomic bomb in Notorious, nitroglycerin in LZ. The villains hide the makings of their super-weapon in wine bottles. The chief villain is assisted by an ominous woman  Claude Rains' mother in Notorious, a dour servant in LZ. The villains kill one of their own members for a small offense a Nazi bungler in Notorious, the English lord in LZ. My attention wandered (more than once) but wasn't there a scene in LZ in which Catherine Zeta-Jones realizes she is being poisoned by the villain? In Notorious Claude Rains and his mother poisoned Ingrid Bergman and almost killed her. And of course in the end the hero rescues the heroine and the villain dies. Notorious is a great film while Legend of Zorro is embarrassingly minor. It shows that film-making and writing skill count for much, and just rewriting a classic script won't ensure a good movie.",The Legend of Zorro

But I really liked it and I prefer it to the first one, probably because I saw this one first.... I thought the plot was excellent, what with Elena being a spy and complex things like that. So well thought out it was confusing at first. Their son was a good actor too. And the Frenchman was a good addition.

The rest is boring recitative filled with witless chatter. A soap-opera is much more exiting. Second: where does the Mexican boy come from ? Was he adopted ? Well maybe he was in the first movie ... thanks god I did not see that one too ... anyhow, he clearly shares no physiognomic traits with either Banderas or Z-Jones.Third and last for the ten lines limit: to get a final touch of the naive-surrealistic aura of the movie, try shaking a champagne bottle of nitroglycerin...Zorro is dead, at least he should be.

The action sequences are, at times, over the top but its all in good fun. I found the score to be maybe a little overly melodramatic during certain scenes but not very noticeably so.

If you seek profundity, subtlety and deep meaning, then you shouldn't go to see a swashbuckler in the first place. And a swashbuckler this film is in spades. The chemistry between Banderas and the stunning Catherine Zeta Jones is superb; their relationship being completely believable. The playing by Adrian Olonso (only eleven years of age) as Joaquin was terrific, and the action - both fights and set pieces - was breathtaking at times. 'The Mask of Zorro' was excellent, and this is a suitable and immensely enjoyable sequel, and then some.

214,accessmi,"Antonio Banderas, Meet Ichabod Crane",4,2 November 2005,"I have always enjoyed Antonio Banderas films, and my only criticism of him was that he sometimes attempts too much humor when the movie calls for more drama. He was excellent in ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,"" and stupendous as Pancho Villa, his best performance, I believe. He was too cute alongside Anthony Hopkins, and the latter carried that movie. This time, however, Banderas appears to be weary. He sleepwalks through the movie. His attempts to muster humor are hollow, and all in all, his performance is lackluster; and in spite of all the banal sword fights, the movie itself is just as shallow. Other actors contribute to this effect. Catherine Zeta Jones character, for example, seemed to come straight out of a wax museum, and the ""loveable kid"" gyrates inanely between extremes of clever genius and gaping stupidity. I found myself pulling for the school master. The two bad guys are even worse. Granted, it is a kids' movie, but at least give us a few reasons to hate them. Like Catherine Zeta Jones' character, the ""heavies"" belong in a shooting gallery, two dimensional targets with painted expressions that spin around all day long when people hit them (which is often). I vote for Zorro's horse as the film's best actor, and the secondary and tertiary actors and actresses consistently out-shined the stars. No wonder Pedro Armendaris seemed to deliver his lines fast, exit stage anywhere, and get the hell out of there. Antonio Banderas, meet Ichabod Crane.",The Legend of Zorro
215,richard-noon2,This is a stupid film,1,12 March 2006,"This is without doubt one of the most awful piles of crap I have had the misfortune to watch in many years. Where to start? We start off with a 2 dimensional baddie trying to scupper a democratic vote. Why?, who is going to gain from this? - who cares? - no explanation is given. The accession of California into the union is a victory for democracy unless of course you are a native American but I wouldn't expect such an ideologically idiotic film to even 'tip its hat' in that direction.Next - this is supposed to be 1850 - I will come back to this in a minute. Cue next baddie - Count Armand, a Frenchman (there's a surprise) who is part of a European conspiracy to destroy the United States. His plan is to supply the Confederate Army (in 1850?) with some bottles of Nitroglycerine so that they can defeat someone (presumably the United States Army - in 1850?) Sounds like an idiotic plan to me. There is a scene where the European baddies are in a room listening to this plan, The English representative gets up and says he wants nothing to do with it whereupon he is killed by the Frenchman. The English are loyal to the US - the French its implacable enemies. Of course less then 100 years before these ludicrous events the French were very much the allies of the fledgling US but, never mind.Shades of the UN security council I think - transparently so. Of course Democracy wins and the 'Old Europe' (to use Donnie R's phrase) baddies are defeated.The best thing I can say about this film is that it is a waste of electricity.

And you really don't expect to see cowboys in a Zorro movie, let alone see the cowboys draw swords...Given the PG rating vs the PG-13, my guess is they aimed for a younger audience this time.

219,navarre-6,Sucked same way as Star Wars,6,11 November 2005,"First thought it was bad acting, but after consideration I'd say it was cheap directing that kept Legend of Zorro from being a great movie. It expertly had a bit of everything that makes an awesome movie, and was really refreshing because of the historic and human aspects.But it was just all thrown together, just one scene after the other until it was done. The weight/drama/authenticity of the marital tensions and wonderful humor wasn't allowed to occur. It could have been so easy, taking just a little more time to linger on an important scene, letting the drama unfold a bit. But apparently it wasn't considered important; all scenes just were treated the same.It's the same thing that ruined the new Star Wars movies. I agree it was a terribly amusing movie, and still pretty good family fun. But it could've been great. Think X-Men - those didn't need blood & guts either. It was rather distracting, smacking my forehead over and over : ) If you don't notice the difference, I wonder why you'd bother writing reviews.",The Legend of Zorro
220,thedreamur,Very Nice Movie!!!,9,26 October 2005,"Very NICE movie!!! I really loved this one (much more than the first). With more action and comedy than the first- the next installment of Zorro's legacy takes it to another level. Most movie sequels tend to NOT give you what you want or desire- this one delivers and makes you hope for another one to make it a nice trio.My wife and I both agreed that even though he's a hero he's still a normal person and it shows in this movie. This movie takes you deep into the heart of Zorro and you can't help but feel his pain, anger, sadness and love throughout the movie. Be ready to take your feelings and emotions on a joy ride- this movie will deliver just that and more.Can't wait for the DVD to come out. Even though I had the chance to preview it I will see it again once it's released officially. I'll rate this movie a 9 out of 10 in my book. A must SEE and a must HAVE for the movie collector!",The Legend of Zorro
221,yahadin,Where have all the heroes gone?,1,11 November 2005,"Well I thought I had aged, but looking at Antonio Banderas's, bloated crinkled self, trying to leap around like a Peter Pan, was anything, but weightless or graceful. In fact it was so bad they had to have the horse do most of the hard work, including the difficult stunts! This was just such a cheesy bad film and the sorriest excuse for a sequel I have ever seen. It doesn't deserve much more wasted words or lines, though I must put in a minimum of 1,000. So, unless you are very young,(and I mean, very young! You know, learning to talk...etc) don't put yourself through this.""I told you so!""",The Legend of Zorro
222,mrc_figueroa,Good Movie,8,29 October 2005,"Because there are hardly any big screen movies that contain the rich culture, the history and the overall look that this movie has, it simply can not be compared in the manner that most movies are compared, in spite of the imperfections it had. This film was as unique as ""The Mask of Zorro"". It is not a sequel but it is simply a totally different story of this unique Mexican-American folk hero. Compared to the first movie however, this new one showed more of Zorro's fighting, which was never bloody but elegant and intelligent. I felt that the love conflict between Elena and De la Vega may have been too long but the breath taking action that comes after brings it back to a balance. The plot was not very ""concrete"" but it was entertaining. The special effects were better than the first and the acting was just as good, if not better. This is not you typical movie. You really have to have a love and an understanding for this story to see it in a different way. Nevertheless, it was a well done movie that does what it has to and that is to show us Zorro.",The Legend of Zorro
223,gbrg1863-1,The Mask Of Zoro,8,29 October 2005,"I saw The Mask of Zoro on 10/29/2005. It's a decent sequel as far as sequels go. Jones and Banderas work well together and do a good job of reprising their original roles. Adrian Alonso was a good choice for del la Vega/Zoro's son. He acts just like a miniature Zoro. Zoro's horse develops its personality in this movie through drinking and smoking a pipe. The bad guys are naturally bad and you dislike them all very quickly. There are a few historical inaccuracies, but only a history buff would spot them. I would consider it a good choice for families with kids over 10 yrs. old. There is lots of sword play and fighting. Several bad guys bite the dust, but there is nothing graphically gory. In the end good triumphs over evil and the day is saved. Its worth the matinée price, but I would not have paid full price to see it.",The Legend of Zorro
224,SFMARGUY,What happened to Anthony Hopkins,7,29 October 2005,"Forgive me--more of a question than a comment-- Had seen on several sites that Anthony Hopkins was to come back in flashback sequence(s)--Saw LOZ yesterday-- not all that bad but would have been better with AH. Bandera and CZJ are always a pleasure to watch no matter what...Too long and opening story line was unpleasant albeit a set up for the plot twist; The young actor who played the son was good!-- Effects were good...wanted more fight scenes and more CZJ involvement- not as the nagging wife but as the love interest she started out to be;Movie threw in some comedy that was so far apart that it seemed forced;But again, can anyone tell me what happened to Anthony Hopkins? thanks SFMARGUY@AOL.COM",The Legend of Zorro
225,jsosne,skip this and watch the Mask of Zorro on DVD,1,30 October 2005,"I enjoyed the last movie, but was sorely disappointed by this film. The plot is ridiculous and the writing is weak. Some of the action sequences are great, but most of them are absurd. While some may enjoy the idea of a 10 year old boy in fight sequences, I thought it was silly. The movie's attempt at comedy came across as just plain goofy. There was just enough violence to ruin the movie for younger children (one child in the theater started crying). Anthony Hopkins lent the lat movie a touch of class that is lacking in this film. There may indeed be enough chemistry between the stars to warrant another movie, but the story and dialog made it impossible for me to enjoy to enjoy this film.",The Legend of Zorro
226,misspiggy911,WOW - A Sequel Well Worth Waiting For,10,30 October 2005,"As a lifelong Zorro fan, I was very taken with ""The Mask of Zorro"". The story & characters were easily the best cinematic version of this well loved classic. Sometimes a sequel is simply a rehash of the same story as the original. (Hey, it's worked for the Bond flicks... over and over and over...) Often sequels don't live up to the promise of the original, but occasionally a sequel does in fact deliver the goods. Happily, this is one of those times.THE LEGEND OF ZORRO takes the original premise and advances it, primarily by developing the characters and allowing them to grow up into more fully rounded human beings. It seems that a lot of reviewers are unhappy that Zorro is now a dad, and that being a dad is an important part of his life. The classic little postscript at the end of ""The Mask of Zorro"" certainly made it clear that Alejandro and Elena got married and had a baby and both were enamored of parenthood. Taking their story to the next level, the child would have to have grown a little from the gurgling baby we saw in the original film. I applaud the filmmakers for allowing such heroes to have a real family life which impacts on their characters, relationship and ultimately the story.Antonio Banderas' portrayal of Alejandro/Zorro was once again nothing short of brilliant. Certainly there was a decent script there for him to work with, but the characterization and the comic timing that he brings to the role are uniquely his own. Catherine Zeta-Jones again brings grace, charm and spirit to her reprise of Elena, but now she has the added dimension of motherhood to alter her priorities and her choices. The dynamic of the conflict between these two lovers/heroes is very nicely done. They have compelling motivations and some very grown up decisions, and sometimes mistakes, to make. I was half expecting their son to be annoying from the snatches of him I'd seen in the TV ads, but his character was nicely developed and elaborated on. His was an important contribution to this film. Of course, having a child cuts into the time for passionate love scenes, although Zorro's intrepid steed Tornado steals more scenes than his son does. Personally I thought it all played beautifully. Alejandro and Elena leave no doubt in your mind that they are still very much in love with one another, even when (and maybe especially when) they are in disagreement, and there are certainly a few passionate bits. The comedic elements were mostly the kind I love best, growing out of character and situation rather than merely being contrived one liners. But it is of course a Zorro film, so there needs to be swordplay (yes!) and action (dazzling!) to round things out. Funnily enough, there weren't even any historical anachronisms that I could spot. This is not heavy drama, it is a romantic action/adventure film, and for that I place it at the top of the class. BRAVO!",The Legend of Zorro
227,bagga_aru,An entertaining movie,8,1 November 2005,"This movie starring Catherine Zeta Jones and Antonio Benderas (Alejandro) can be described precisely as a Bollywood (story written in idealized fantasy-land) potboiler. In the movie one can find more things unreal than real, apart from gimmicks of Alejandro, his son and Jones. The best thing about the movie is that one can guess what is going to happen, try this while you are watching. I don't want to give out the plot but the movie has lot of action and noise, not suitable for kids though, with all these explosions. A pretty good watch, for which I had to go to the theater, and which definitely should have incorporated the famous scene from Mask of Zorro, ""He was very vigorous!!""",The Legend of Zorro
228,stephanie_pinkprincess,comment for Zorro 2,10,31 October 2005,"I've watched this movie and i think it's really excellent ! Even my small siblings love it ! The actions in this movie are really great and the all the actors acted very well. I truly admire the director of this movie because he has used lots of techniques for this movie like suspense, humour, happiness, sadness etc.The part where McGivens attacked Gulliermo and his family, I really cried out because it was so sad. And when i started watching the movie, i guess all of us will think that the two men who kept following Zorro n his family are bad guys who worked for McGivens.But they are actually the agents. this shows that the director has planned everything so well that there are no parts that make viewers confuse. I really enjoyed this movie and i thought of watching it another time because it was so nice to watch. Zorro's son, Hoaquin was cute in this movie and it was so funny to see him being so naughty in school. he fought really well just like his father. they way Zorro fought was so macho n i really like it. Elena is so beautiful n she fought very well too. for the bad guys in this movie -McGivens, Armand etc., they acted really bad n made the viewers hate them and this is what people called good actors.Lastly, this movie is really nice to watch and i'll keep recommending this movie to all my friends.",The Legend of Zorro
229,spencerkids,Great Mom and Dad's night out,9,2 November 2005,"I am a mom of 5 children, so when I get a night out to see a movie I don't want to see a dud. When It is a date with your husband it is even tougher. It can't be too much of a chic flick and I don't want to see something too violent. It isn't easy to find a movie with some action (Dad) some romance (Mom) and some comedy (both). This movie did it. Now I am not saying it should get some academy award but I sure wish there were more movies like this. It was suspenseful without being gory. It was romantic and sexy without the sex (women love that). The addition of the child added a parent component that we liked. It really could be considered as a family movie for older children. I can't specifically recall any profanity (that doesn't mean there wasn't).This movie was definitely not a waste of a babysitter. It was also nice and long for those of us with a longer attention span who want a more developed plot. The story was interesting and entertaining and funny (if you catch it).",The Legend of Zorro
230,rhildebr,A great afternoon at the movies!!!,8,3 November 2005,"I saw this movie today, November 4th. After what all the critics said I felt I have my own sense of a good or bad movie. I found Zorro to be a GREAT film! Zorro is the early Californian Batman, the movie had suspense, action, great stunts, and to see him on his horse coming out of the fire or racing on top of the train was worth the price of the movie ticket on their own. One local, very young, critic said to stay home and rent Spy Kids instead of seeing Zorro. As for me, I hope there is a third movie and will buy this one when it comes out on DVD to add to my personal library.",The Legend of Zorro
231,ambreenv,What I thought,9,5 November 2005,I have just watch the movie today and I think it is brilliant.This movie is not better then The Mask Of Zorro but it is brilliant in its own way.The characters of Zorro/Alejandro and Elena look and feel better this time round.The fight scenes are brilliant/funny and made me want to shout out GO ZORRO at the theatre.My best scene is the big argument between Alejandro and Elena when they first meet during their break. It was very funny!!Another thing I think I should mention is that you don't have to watch the Mask Of Zorro to understand the story of The Legend of Zorro.I Advise You To Go And Watch It!!!,The Legend of Zorro
232,bjbcool,"okay, but unbelievable",7,7 November 2005,"Zorro is decent- The acting is almost perfect and the dialogue is average. Zorro's son's use of words is ""modern"" (including words not used in 1850) but is inserted for comic relief. One thing that really irritated me was the ending explosion. The ""test"" nitroglycerin explosion Zorro saw in the woods left a humongous crater with fires all around. When the entire shipment of nitro explodes it makes a much smaller explosion. Zorro, of course, dives behind a rock wall that appears out of the blue. This escape from imminent danger is very unbelievable and occurs throughout the course of the film. The action in this movie was not that incredible. (""The Incredibles"" had cooler moves) Zorro flips, dives and rolls but it its hard to believe and it looks very CGI. Overall, the acting is superb and the script is funny and entertaining... if you overlook the incredibly ""comic-book"" style plot. Bjb, signing off.",The Legend of Zorro
233,apohrte-1,Pure escapist entertainment,10,11 November 2005,"I grinned wide through the entire 2 hour plus movie. Just loved it. Loved Banderas as a thoroughly funny Zorro. Loved the repartee between Elena and Zorro. Loved Joaquin as a throughly wonderful young boy but not a scene stealing brat. Loved the horse. Stunts were great. Plot was a who-cares but I was so involved in what comes next I didn't care about the plot. A must see and better than the first because the initial movies take too long to establish characterizations; the sequels usually just leap right into the action. Great swordplay with Banderas and Zeta-Jones. And Catherine is just too pretty to be real. The costumes were worthy but hard to swallow Confederate soldiers uniforms in what was supposed to be 1850. Once again, I didn't care about the plotting. The action and interaction among the family members was great. The villains were appropriately ready for dying, which took a bit long. Finish the job is what I always say--but then there is less story.",The Legend of Zorro

There was one good thing about the movie was the fact that they have one of the hottest actresses ever playing one of the lead roles which makes it a 1/10 instead of a 0/10.I believe that this movie was just another remake of the story of Zorro that we all know.I also don't believe that the acting was that great, but they tried their best so I guess its OK! Do yourself a favour and stay in or if you do go to the movies try something quite better like Saw 2 or HP which comes out this Friday :D.",The Legend of Zorro
235,ma_kettle_on_the_farm,World's Worst Sequel !!!,1,18 November 2005,"Antonio Banderas' first Zorro movie was a delight, comparable to the classic MARK OF ZORRO. However, this sequel is historically inaccurate to the point of making a cartoon buffoon of a traditional hero. As a person of Irish descent and a Christian I am personally insulted that the ""bad guy"" was depicted as a Christion wearing an Irish cross, and a woman's cross at that! I am extremely annoyed at the lack of imagination at Hollywood's latest stereotypical ""bad guy"" i.e., the radical , white, scripture quoting, so-called Christian bigot. The only demonstrable bigots left in America are Hollywood screenwriters! In addition, I found the anachronisms in this movie to be worse than those found in the cheapest ""B"" movie of times past. Some rifles used hadn't been invented yet by 1850 and heroes' wives didn't spend their spare time emasculating their husbands. The Gold Rush of 1849 brought great numbers of American immigrants to California and the Mexican population is confused with that of Texas. And on to the cartoonery-- Why does Zorro look as if he belongs in a Jackie Chan movie? If he is invulnerable to lead bullets, he should have worn armour. After falling from a great height, each ""bad guy"" bounced back like Wylie coyote. A torturous hot poker resulted in a yowl like the big bad wolf uttered when He hit Bugs bunny's stove. Why could Zorro only slash ropes while the evil characters killed innocent people? This movie did not permit the avenging of the oppressed. If the intent was to soften violence for an juvenile audience, it sadly fails. This movie was an attempt at poorly hidden political correctness and denies the audience another encounter with a great American mythical hero.",The Legend of Zorro
236,bookwormjen,Excellent Movie,10,24 November 2005,"This movie was fantastic! It kept me at the edge of my seat. It was utterly romantic. It was passionate, and just really really good. There was lots of action, and it was very suspenseful.In addition, Zorro was still hot. Elena was as mysterious as ever. There were major sparks flying. Their son was super witty and made me laugh lots. The family banded together through the course of the movie. The horse was really funny as well. The writers did a good job of integrating humor into the movie.If the first movie was about finding yourself, the second was about staying true to yourself.When will the third Zorro movie come out?",The Legend of Zorro

After the first 15 minutes, I decided to talk to my friends next to me and then listen to my i-pod. The only decent part was when the kid beat up his teacher. If you look at the people's mustaches, you will laugh histerically. I didn't understand that when Alejandro and that other guy were playing polo, why they had to joust. What happened to using your mallet to hit the ball through the posts. I only saw the first Zorro movie in french but even though i couldn't understand it, it was still better than the sequel.

240,mrgstuart,Trite garbage,2,3 February 2006,"I want to start out by saying that the first Zorro was a decent movie, with good chemistry between the stars, fine action, and a reasonable plot. This movie misses the mark entirely. The movie pretty much starts with him throwing a hat at a villain knocking him off his horse. This could happen I guess, but it looks more like he was hit by a bowling ball, and not by a hat. The little kid is annoying. Having him taunt the bad guys with clichéd crap like, ""you want a piece of me"" is awful. Following this by having him kung-fu fight them, even worse. By the time the movie is over anyone with an IQ over 60 will probably hate all the characters involved. The movie is bad in all the ways thoughtless sequels are.

Rufus Sewell as Armand and Adrian Alonso as Joaquin were outstanding and of course, Antonio Banderas IS Zorro and Catherine Zeta-Jones is breathtaking. They certainly have a cinematic chemistry that is vibrant and believable.

243,v-marsh,Glaring anachronism - Henry rifle shown 10 years before it was patented.,7,25 February 2006,"Enjoyable, but one totally unnecessary anachronism. The time in the movie was before California joined the United States, which didn't happen until 1850. In the beginning of the movie, one of the characters introduces a Henry repeating rifle, which wasn't patented until 1860 and not in the hands of the Union soldiers until mid-1862.Grrrr. The other problem, is that the swordplay between the Count and Zorro was not up to the standards of the first movie, which was based on the Spanish school of fencing. The Count was French, but did not use the French style.Other than that, it was fun. I think that some of the horse stunts were too unbelievable, and that any horse would have had their legs broken falling through the railroad car.

244,charqweshia-s-tucker001,My opinion,6,24 March 2006,This movie started off boring but as you continue to watch the movie it got interesting. What like really like about the movie was how it was set up. How Zorro was unknown among his community and was just a regular guy. How his son did not know who he really was to the end. But what had my attention was how Zorro and his wife had got into a little argument in the beginning and by the next day she was asking for a divorce. Met this other man and was seeing him and then planned on marrying him. With Zorrow still confused was just tripping me out. But what was real funny was when Zorro found out that she was working under cover for the 2 investigators to help save California. Yes I can honestly say that it turn out to be a good movie.,The Legend of Zorro

In all it was a good movie. The only part that I didn't like was he kept trying to keep his secret from his son were if he would have just told him it would have been even better i think. i think if he would have told him his son could have been better and they could have teamed up for even more action. I also think that his wife should have stop tripping and supported him so they could have been together in the whole movie. Because the seen what they did together was one of the best scenes when they both cut they signs the e and z into the man pants. So if see wouldn't have been acting like that they could have probably been stopped the bad guys.",The Legend of Zorro
