0,Leofwine_draca,Solid sci-fi action with a downbeat tone,7,2 November 2016,"Despite having a bad reputation, ROBOCOP 2 turns out to be above average. A flawed gem, perhaps, as one rather large problem with this film is the lack of fresh ideas which made the original film so entertaining. Indeed, many of the action sequences are simply repeated from the first film, and changed slightly so we hopefully don't spot the similarity. For instance: Robocop smashes a man's head repeatedly into an arcade machine (in the original, he smashed Kurtwood Smith's head through numerous windows); Robocop cleverly kills a man holding a baby in front of him (in the original, he shot a man holding a woman hostage in the groin).The acting is worse than in the original. To be fair, special effects have always overwhelmed the actors in this particular film series, but it's difficult to take many of the supporting cast seriously as they look as if they're about to burst into laughter at any minute. Peter Weller is as good as ever, although he doesn't undergo as much anguish or torment as he did in the first film. Nancy Allen is used sparingly, indeed she hardly makes an impression and was obviously tiring of the series by now. Tom Noonan makes an effective psychotic, although he's difficult to take seriously too. I could have done without the scene of the dying boy; we're supposed to feel sorry for him after he's mutilated Robo and tried to garrote Allen? I think not.A lot of people dislike this film because of the excessive violence and downbeat nature, but for me, it's the main saving grace. It's true, a lot of people die needlessly, gunned down in cold blood. Robocop is even tortured and has his limbs cut off in a disused warehouse, although this isn't as powerful as his original death in the first film. The gore is plentiful, although not as varied as in the first film: it mostly consists of people being shot, their chests exploding in red bursts. These depressing moments are countered by some interesting ideas; namely, the sub-plot involving Robocop being reprogrammed by his makers which induces some laughter; and the whole idea of the 'nuke' drug. I'm glad that the fake news bulletins stayed in too, as these were highlights of the first film and they're just as funny here.A big plus in the film's favour is the quality of the special effects work involved. In particular, the stop motion animation is wonderful, and used a lot in the film's finale where Robocop battles Robocop 2 in a fight to the death. The standard of the animation is particularly good, even beating ED-209 in the original, in fact. Watch out for a spooky bit where a malfunctioning cyborg rips its helmet off to reveal a screaming skull underneath - disturbing or what? The film is also worth sitting through for the twenty minute finale, a huge battle sequence in which hundreds of people are shot, loads of cars explode and the two cyborgs rip each other apart. It's certainly showstopping, but bittersweet too for fans of the series; this was where the quality ended.",RoboCop 2
1,SnoopyStyle,Messy sequel struggling in B-movie territories,5,14 February 2014,"OMNI wants to take over Detroit. There's a new drug called Nuke. The police is on strike. Detroit can't pay OMNI. Under contract, if the city miss a payment, they can foreclose on city property.RoboCop (Peter Weller) is struggling with his humanity. Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) is back as RoboCop's partner. They try to take on the drug gang by tracking a criminal child. Meanwhile OMNI can't quite perfect RoboCop 2 because the subjects keep committing suicide. Dr. Juliette Faxx (Belinda Bauer) believes she can select the right candidate for the program by using murderers and psychotics.The over use of kids as criminals really cheese up the B-movie factor. And the weird goodie two shoes RoboCop just makes it silly. Even the actor playing the mayor of Detroit is weak and silly. It's like the people in charge can't wait to make this as stupid as possible. Everything about this movie screams B-movie. It's a shame because the franchise could have gone the other way. The skeletal remains of a good franchise is still there.",RoboCop 2
2,jboothmillard,RoboCop 2,5,28 June 2005,"I have always thought that Paul Verhoeven's first film has stood out as the best RoboCop film, I can't really remember if this sequel was that good or not. Peter Weller returns as the cybernetic cop in this quite good film where RoboCop both tries to do his job while (I think) trying to be controlled and facing his past before being a robot. I think there is a sequence where he starts telling kids to be bad, but I can remember there is a scene where his memory goes for a minute. He still has the very nice car as well. And is it me, or does his girlfriend from the first film die? Not bad, but the first was better. Worth watching!",RoboCop 2
3,BA_Harrison,RoboCop-out.,6,13 December 2010,"Whoever thought that Irvin Kershner (nice bloke/mediocre director) would be the right person to take over the reins of the Robocop franchise from Paul Verhoeven (enfant terrible/movie maverick) should be made to explain themselves to a malfunctioning ED-209 (""You have 20 seconds to justify your decision... 15 seconds... 10 seconds.... BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!""): although Kershner proved himself capable of putting together a slick, family-friendly sci-fi sequel with The Empire Strikes Back, he's clearly way out of his depth when dealing with the kind of gritty, über-violent, and wickedly satirical content that is second nature for Hollywood bad-boy Verhoeven.As one might expect, there are lots of explosions, gunfire, bloody bullet hits, and special effects on show, but Kirshner plays it all way too safe, displaying none of the excess or imagination that made the first film such an incredible experience. When you factor in a surprisingly poor script from comic geek favourite Frank Miller, an uninspired performance from star Peter Weller that feels more like contractual obligation rather than a genuine yearning to reprise the role, a forgettable main bad guy in the form of Tom Noonan (with a bloody kid as his sidekick!), and some weak attempts at mimicking the original's wry humour, what you have is a sequel that just about satisfies on the most basic of levels (it's got guns and robots and Nancy Allen), but can only be seen as a disappointment when compared to its predecessor.5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",RoboCop 2
4,Coventry,"Sequel, upgrade and rival!",7,29 August 2018,"""Robocop 2"" belongs in the same list as ""Psycho II"", ""Hellbound: Hellraiser II"", ""Prom Night II: Hello Mary Lou"", ""Exorcist II: The Heretic"", ""The Howling II"" and perhaps a handful of other titles that I'm momentarily forgetting. What defines this list, apart from the obvious fact they are all sequels? They are all criminally underrated and underestimated sequels that at least tried something different rather than simply cashing in further on the known and proven-to-be-successful formulas of the original. Films like these generally receive low ratings and negative reviews, not necessarily because they are inferior, but mainly because the people weren't expecting innovative plot aspects or sudden changes in tone or atmosphere. ""Robocop 2"" was written by none other than Frank Miller, the genius behind ""Sin City"", so you know that the comic book style violence and twisted humor will be even more extreme than in the original (and Verhoeven's original already was extremely violent and quite twisted)! Add to this the sublime skills of the director who made what is, to date, still the darkest and greatest episode of the ""Star Wars"" franchise, and you've got yourself a derailed and uncompromising popcorn action-flick! Miller's script doesn't avoid any taboos, and includes megalomaniac villains, the glorification of drug abuse, large-scaled corruption and underaged criminal offenders. Detroit looks like an even bigger asphalt wasteland than before and the privatizing of the police by OCP (Omni Consumer Products) continues to lead to strikes and anarchy. Officer Alex Murphy, aka Robocop, is the last reliable law enforcer, but his inventors at OCP have different plans. The title of the film doesn't only refer to the fact it's a sequel, ""Robocop 2"" is also supposed to be an upgraded version of the first half man/half machine policeman that was ""Robocop"". However, the crazy lady at OCP decided to use the brain and spinal course of psychopathic drug-lord and killer Cain for her test model, so he quickly turns out to be a more destructive killing machine than all the criminal organizations in Detroit combined. There are a whole lot of things in ""Robocop 2"" that don't make the slightest bit of sense, but at least it's insanely entertaining and fast-paced. Tom Noonan's performance as Cain is fabulously over-the-top, and his gang contains the meanest and most badass 14-year-old of the 80s/90s era. The shootouts are nasty and explicit, and a few scenes that come to mind are definitely not suitable for people with a faint stomach.",RoboCop 2

6,Theo Robertson,Not Bad,6,6 January 2005,"A lot of people really hated ROBOCOP 2 when it was released in the Summer of 1990 : "" Oh it's not as good as the first one , oh it's too violent , etc , etc "" If they thought the sequel was violent did they actually sit down to see the original ? One can't help thinking the critics of this had only seen the TV version of 1987's ROBOCOP , you know the one that had every scene of violence censored along with classic dubbed lines like "" You gonna be a bad mothercrusher "" DirectorIrvin Kershner deserves little if any criticism so I'll point out that what's wrong with ROBOCOP 2 is Frank Miller and Walon Green's script ,it's by no means terrible it's just that the central plot of a corrupt corporate member putting a criminals brain into a new robocop model is rather simplistic therefore the running time is taken up with the bad guy dismembering Murphy and later Murphy becoming a changed robot By no means an awful movie and one that's far better than ROBOCOP 3 and the following PG rated television series",RoboCop 2
7,Scarecrow-88,Robocop 2,9,17 August 2013,"Ridiculously gratuitous sequel to Robocop has Detroit just wrought with crime and disorder. I mean, pee wee baseball players, led by their coach, raid an electronics store in broad daylight, equipped with baseball bats, willing to use them to break open displays and bash the owner if he interferes. Loaded with corrupt characters at every turn, from the commercial conglomerate OCP (trying to ""buy the city""), to the mayor (willing to form a partnership with drug dealers in order to help keep OCP from ""foreclosing the city""!), the city of Detroit (using Detroit as the epicenter for all of the storyline's disastrous evil and mismanagement is a satire unto itself, considering the city's notoriety in crime) is under a siege of evil certain to topple it to its knees. Oh, OCP's chairman (Dan O'Herlihy, with plenty of the menace still left over from Halloween III to spare; this time he's a corporate powerhouse in need of some humbling) has a masterplan for Detroit, a ""New Detroit"" that offers tall skyscrapers of steel and glass, with the citizens even able to own shares of stock after their neighborhoods and homes are demolished and bulldozed in favor of a ""brighter tomorrow"". The mean-spirit and black heart of this film runs rampant as Tom Noonan (as Cain) uses a child (a potty-mouthed Gabriel Damon) and cop (Stephen Lee; Dolls) to peddle his drug, Nuke, to youth and adults alike. Within all this amoral abyss is Robocop (Peter Weller, who does wonders behind the robo-suit of blue&black armour and makeup), still harboring memories from his past with the family now lost, trying to protect the innocent and arrest the wrong-doing criminals plaguing the city. Robocop goes through his share of hell, as Cain and his hoods get the best of him (they get the drop on him, capitalizing on his being alone and outnumbered), subduing and dismantling him, leaving the dismembered parts outside the police station for Detroit's protesting cops to observe (they're striking because of the lack of money available to them). OCP won't even provide the necessary equipment and resources to rebuild Robocop, instead concerned with building a ""new and improved"" model called Robocop 2. In charge of that operation is Dr. Juliette Faxx (Belinda Bauer), somebody who uses her looks and sex appeal to gain the attention and position of power by banging the OCP chairman. She has the bright idea of using the brain of a maniac (Cain, when Robocop finally nabs him) for the Robocop 2 (Why? I have no idea. It seems rather boneheaded and idiotic to me.), with his introduction to the press ending in absolute chaos only Robocop 1 will be able to halt.With superb special effects (especially the final battle between Robocop and ""Cain Robocop"" as the OCP headquarters becomes their battleground, Robocop in pieces, and Weller's face seemingly plastered to metal (although his eyes and lips move fluidly)), repellent villains, and a warped sense of humor (the lowest common denominator lives in Detroit, that's for sure), Robocop 2 sure as hell isn't boring. It will no doubt leave a bad taste and could very well repulse quite a few with characters so repugnant and vile, and violence so graphic (bloodshed and bullets aplenty), it has little patience for humanity or grace. Funny, isn't it, that the most humane character seems to be a half-man/half-machine?!?! Among the grisly highlights (or is it lowlights?) are a surgery on Lee with Noonan forcing Gabriel to watch, the whole press core getting obliterated by ""Cain Robocop"" when it goes berserk, Gabriel understanding he was about to die (wanting Robocop to stay with him as life slips away), Noonan's skull sawed open and plucked away by the surgical staff, and Robocop pulling out Cain's brain from the Robocop 2's control center and bashing in into the concrete. The body count in this bad boy must have been in double digits. The screenplay is foul-mouthed and wholly unpleasant...this is right out of a take-no-prisoners comic book mentality. Probably the most absurd sequence of events comes from Laxx's reprogramming Robocop to act a polite, mannered buffoon.",RoboCop 2
8,preppy-3,As bad as Robocop--but in a different way,7,30 December 2006,"Robocop (Peter Weller) is back fighting drug lord Cain (Tom Noonan), his gang and an evil OCP executive (Daniel O'Herlihy) and his helper (Belinda Bauer) who want to replace Robcop with different machines.This starts off OK with Robocop foiling a robbery. Then it goes downhill. You see him stalking his wife he had when he was human. Then OCP convince him he's not human, he rejects his wife...and the storyline never comes up again (????) Why even bother with it???? The movie is not as bloody as the first but it has a mean streak running through it that is unpleasant:SPOILERS!!!!!! Robocop is chained down and taken apart piece by piece; a man is cut open and a child is forced to watch; we see children swearing, taking drugs, killing people and being killed. These scenes aren't fun or exciting...just real sick. SPOILER END!!!!!!!!!!!!Also the story gets REAL stupid after the hour mark and, like the first, plot loopholes pop up left and right. The last battle is far too long--I don't care how good the effects are.There are good things--the great stop motion animation and special effects; the dark humor is still present and strong; the tests of cyborgs to take over Robocop are quite funny (O'Herlihy's reactions are priceless) and the story was never boring. The acting varies--Weller is as good as possible in the getup; Nancy Allen is hardly in this (she seems like an after thought); O'Herily is fun; Noonan is OK and Bauer is TERRIBLE in her role. Yes she is beautiful but not an actress.So--on par with ""Robocop""--good or bad is your call.",RoboCop 2
9,poolandrews,"I don't care what anyone says, I love Robocop 2.",8,3 July 2008,"Robocop 2 is again set in Detroit in the near future a year after the events of the original Robocop, Detroit is almost entirely financed by the company OCP. The city is in a state lawlessness as most of the cops are on strike as OCP cut their pay, OCP President (Dan O'Herlihy) watches on as his plan to foreclose on the current administration is working which will let OCP take complete control of Detroit. Out on the street a new addictive drug called Nuke is flooding the city, crime & violence follows it. Robocop & the few remaining cops have their hands full. Meanwhile evil scientist Dr. Juliette Faxx (Belinda Bauer) has set about creating a successor to Robocop, another cyborg crime prevention unit to protect & serve. However her real motives aren't as noble as they first seem...Directed by Irvin Kershner this sequel to the popular Robocop (1987) was unfairly trashed on it's initial release & has a pretty bad reputation but it's a film that I love & while not quite as good as the original in my opinion it's still a terrific film that is probably more fun to watch than it's predecessor. The script credited to Frank Miller was apparently heavily rewritten & maybe that's why the story is a little choppy at times, for instance the character's are good but what was the comedy relief Mayor all about? Robocop's partner Lewis is relegated to standing around for the majority of the film & only seems there to provide some continuity to the original. Why was the subplot about Murphy's wife so short & dropped as soon as it was brought up? That would have given Robocop 2 a human edge. However the biggest single problem with Robocop 2 I have is why would anyone put the brain of a sadistic killer & drug baron into a heavily armed cyborg? It just doesn't make any sort of sense, what was Dr. Faxx's reasons behind it? It was supposed to be a police unit, right? Why get it addicted to Nuke as well? If you don't think about it too much it probably won't bother you. Now the good stuff, it moves along at a great pace with lots of action & I just love the huge over-the-top Robocop vs. Robocop 2 fight at the end, any serious sci-fi geek will lap it up. While the pitch black biting satire of the original isn't quite here there are still some nice moments including OCP trying to take control of Detroit & use it to make a profit, some funny commercial breaks (the one with the guy who commits suicide is funny) & the sequence where Robocop is reprogrammed to be good & none violent by upper class twits who have never lived in the real world is hilarious. I just think there is so much here to enjoy, plenty of gory violent action, lots of special effects, cool robots, car chases, explosions & some neat action scenes. What's not to like?I really like the look of Robocop 2 & I liked the special effects. I think Robocop 2 was one of the last big budget theatrically released films to predominantly use stop-motion animation for the majority of the effects, over the next couple of years with the likes of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) & Jurassic Park (1993) in particular stop-motion died out virtually overnight & was replaced by CGI. I personally love stop-motion animation, it gives you the sense that there is actually something three dimensional there & while it can sometimes look a little jerky I seriously doubt if Robocop 2 was CGI it would look significantly any better. The Robocop vs. Robocop 2 fight at the end is just outrageous, from elevator shafts to the top of 100 storey buildings the makers have fun & in turn we, the audience, have fun. Well, I did anyway. Robocop 2 is also a very violent & pretty gory film, from snipers getting shot through their eye to dozens of people getting gorily riddled with bullets, there's a torture scene as someone is sliced open, there's a very gory brain removal sequence as there is a human brain in a tank & the person it used to belong to's hollowed out decapitated head, necks are violently broken, kids are shot & a guy has his eye poked out by a stiletto heel.Technically the film is good with some great special effects in my opinion although some may find them a bit dated. Filmed in Houston in Texas. The acting is alright, the main villain Cain played by Tom Noonan isn't a patch on Boddicker from the original though.Robocop 2 is a film that I think is fantastic, it's got some cool robots & lots of fun special effects sequences as well as plenty of blood, gore & violence although the dark satire of the first film is somewhat replaced by goofy silliness it tries to please everyone. Followed by the dire Robocop 3 (1993), the TV series Robocop (1994 - 1995) & the TV mini-series Robocop: Prime Directives (2000).",RoboCop 2
10,utgard14,"""Bad language makes for bad feelings.""",5,27 June 2014,"The police are on strike but not RoboCop. He's busy tracking down Cain, a drug dealer responsible for a lethal new drug on the streets called nuke. Sequel to the classic RoboCop is not in the same league as the first film but still fairly entertaining. Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, and Daniel O'Herlihy return. Tom Noonan plays the villain Cain and he's good. There's an annoying little psycho kid named Hob played by Gabriel Damon. This has a pretty bad reputation but I think it's better than its rep suggests, although it's not without flaws. The script has some decent ideas and some good lines. The direction is pretty flat and the most startling difference between this and the first movie. Whatever else you can say about Paul Verhoeven, he had style and that's missing here.",RoboCop 2

A totally corrupt mayor? Check. A bankrupt city? Check. Traffic-squashed shopping cart ladies, major pollution sludge tank farms, rampant illegal drug use and murderous marauding gaming arcade urchins? Check, check, check and check. If anything, ROBOCOP 2 sugar coats the so-called ""Motor City's"" future (or lack thereof). Even by 1990, Motown bore so little resemblance to a one-time First World city, this flick had to be filmed in Houston, TX. About the only thing for which this self-proclaimed ""Title Town"" could realistically serve as a backdrop then was Urban Ruins Exploitation films, such as POWAQQATSI. Known best recently as the Murder Capital of the USA, this malformed metropolis featured only malaise and malfunction after 1950 or so. If you ignore the robots, ROBOCOP 2 is a virtual documentary about southeast Michigan's Hell on Earth.",RoboCop 2
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Actually one of those that did hold promise,6,25 November 2008,"Sequels have a bad name. There's reason for that. This one, however, can be deceptive: It starts out good. The very opening? Magnificent. It's not unlikely that the casting people of Smallville had just seen that bit when they chose how to fill that role. Sadly, it doesn't last more than the minute or so. After that, there are glimpses, ideas, and here and there, it almost gets to be great. Alas, the rest of it weighs down, and I'd say that the ending is tasteless beyond anything that was in the first. Subtlety seems to have been the initial victim in the onslaught of graphic death in this. Verhoeven gave us a satire, where the social commentary flowed much smoother... like honey, although (intentionally) bitter. This contains dialog so exposition- and explain-happy, one's initial reaction if viewing the two in succession is pure disbelief. Granted, it's not going to go over people's heads... even if they're laying down... but is quality second to profit? ...well, it shouldn't be. This takes the route that other movies that join a franchise in progress have, where the predecessor asked the audience to take something seriously: It makes fun of it. While this goes for a cynicism similar to the real RoboCop film, and clearly does attempt to recreate the certain undefinable thing of it, it just never gets across the same bleakness. Some of the time, it seems to almost parody the original, and encourage us to lighten up with the visions of what may come, at other points it tries too hard at the dark tone, and becomes quite tough to swallow. It didn't even offer an imaginative villain. Did anyone not see coming what the form was going to be? Furthermore, it's got to do with narcotics... how surprising, since the 'bad guy' in the majority of entertainment pieces with a story were around this period wasn't at all a drug lord, a dealer, or a variation thereof. This didn't have to turn out this way. Irvin Kershner, director of the best(definitely in my opinion) Star Wars episode, helmed this. Frank Miller wrote for it... unfortunately, little of it was used(other of that material was included in the third), and I suggest reading the comic based on it to any fan of his. There are characters with credibility and solid writing, at least sometimes. There are interesting concepts here. There's even a bona-fide, genuine scene that can be claimed to potentially invoke emotion in the audience. Nevertheless, the final product is so that I couldn't blame anyone for only watching the one prior to this, of the cinema-released depictions of(this particular version thereof) the future of law enforcement. Maybe this is the real reason Weller passed on the third. Failing that, perhaps he started reading the script of it and decided that life's too short. I recommend this mainly to those who want the entire series, and dreamers who wish to take it in and ponder what might have been. I wouldn't rule out that this could have become one of the few and seldom occurring follow-ups that do justice to what came before them. 6/10",RoboCop 2
13,view_and_review,Robocop 2: Robocop v. Cain,9,21 January 2007,"OCP is at it again.I thought ""Robocop 2"" was great, and at the very least it was better than the first. R2 showed more vulnerability in Robocop and seemingly even more sinister bad guys. And how could you not like Cain? The Robocop v. Cain battle ranks high with me amongst silver screen battles, robots or otherwise. On the one hand there is Robocop: a virtually impenetrable human sized robot with a powerful, fully automatic Desert Eagle hand gun, unlimited ammo, and a dead cop's brain at the controls. On the other hand there is Cain: a state of the art, extra large, finely tuned weapon, with every imaginable weapon of destruction short of a nuclear bomb, and a nuke addicted dead drug dealer's brain at the controls.The entire movie was priming the audience for a magnificent showdown between Robocop and Cain. First they showed Robocop's fallibility by having him chopped up and delivered to the front steps of the police HQ. Second, Robocop fried himself to erase the OCP programming in his brain that was hindering him from pursuing justice. Third, OCP created another robot using Cain's brain, a notorious drug dealer. Finally, ""R2"" made sure to display Cain's devastating power and ruthlessness when he broke up the meeting between the mayor and the young protégé drug dealer. By the time Cain was done, that crime scene looked like mid 70's Beirut. Cain appeared indestructible and far more menacing than the first Robocop bad 'bot: ED 209. The final fight between the two was fantastic, especially if you like destructive, high casualty, spill over fights, and an awesome display of raw power. Robocop knew that he was over-matched so he even resolved to destroy himself in trying to destroy Cain when he pried Cain from the top of the high rise building. It was only Robocop's edge in intelligence that allowed him to finally defeat Cain. ""Robocop 2"" was a rare improvement on an already good movie. The story was serviceable, the characters were a perfect fit, and the action was spot on. This movie was not for anyone looking for a deep message, or any kind of resolution to a previous bad experience. This was purely a good guy v. bad guys, finish with a bang action flick.",RoboCop 2
14,view_and_review,Should've Stopped at Two,9,19 December 2017,"Robocop 2 was one of those rare sequels in which it was better than the first. Much like Godfather they should've stopped at two.In this installment Detroit is bankrupt and in debt to OCP (Omni Consumer Products). OCP plans to foreclose all of the city of Detroit's holdings and effectively take over the city. All the while there is a Nuke outbreak. Nuke is a dangerous drug that has much of the city strung out. Though the police are on strike, Robocop continues to fight crime.I think the story was good and it all set up for a super bout at the end. ED 209 from the first Robocop was a toy compared to the newest death machine Robocop has to battle. In 1990 this movie was visually stunning to me.

There are lots of good performances filling out the peripheral roles, but the top character in the film is without a doubt the killer kid - a refreshingly politically-incorrect antidote to (or is that a logical extension of) the pain and mayhem that Macaulay Culkin caused under the banner of sugary family entertainment in the same year's ""Home Alone"". **1/2 out of 4.",RoboCop 2
16,Uriah43,An Adequate Sequel More or Less,5,28 October 2017,"This film essentially picks up where its predecessor left off with the cyborg known as ""Robocop"" (Peter Weller) going about his business trying to keep crooks off the streets of a dystopian Detroit. Unfortunately, there are two organized forces with vastly different agendas which interfere in his efforts. The first is a murderous drug-dealer named ""Cain"" (Tom Noonan) who has cornered the market on a new drug known as ""Nuke"" and he intends on selling it at all costs. The second major obstacle to Robocop's efforts to clean up the streets of Detroit is the corporation known as ""OCP"" who initially created him but now has plans to remove him in favor of other cyborgs which they intend to mass-market. Meanwhile, crime continues to be rampant and the police department can only do so much with the resources they have available. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay sequel for the most part but definitely doesn't measure up to its illustrious predecessor. It just didn't seem to have the necessary attention to detail like the previous film. Be that as it may, while this film most certainly could have been better, I didn't think it was a bad movie by any means and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",RoboCop 2

18,FlashCallahan,Thank you for not smoking....,7,9 October 2011,"A few months after RoboCop defeats Clarence Boddicker and Dick Jones. His job is far from done, and several issues make it so.The Detroit police is on strike, OCP is developing both a new robot officer to replace him and to begin construction of ""Delta City"" to replace Detroit.To make matters worse, there is a new group of criminals who made a new drug called ""Nuke"", led by a man only named ""Cain"".RoboCop and his partner Anne Lewis must get the Detroit police back on its feet, Defy OCP, and stop Cain.Plus, OCP may even have something for Cain as well....Well the movie suffers from the lack of Verhoeven, and Murphys family life is as good as finished within the first twenty minutes, but you cannot deny that this is one hell of an action film.Gone are the Christ allegory what featured heavy in the first film, this is all about Robo getting injured, getting revenge on Cai, and then Cain becoming the titular character.There is the usual consumerism in the form of great adverts and there is a subplot involving the mayor and the privatisation of Detroit.But this is about two robots fighting, and Robo going a little nuts in the second half, nd the film doesn't disappoint. The stop motion effects are some of the best i've see, and the film just like Robo, appear to have lively glossy sheen about it.A lot of the characters are put on the back burner for this, notably Lewis, who is nothing more than a supporting role in this. Cain is nowhere near as sadistic as Boddicker, and Noonan looks as if he could fall asleep in some scenes.For sheer violence and fun, go fr his.

19,Aaron1375,Not like the first one at all...but it did have a nice concluding fight.,5,13 September 2008,"Well the good here is that Peter Weller is back and there is a rather cool fight at the end. For those who say who does it matter who plays Robocop you must watch the next one and you can hear Robocop is just not as forceful in his voice as he is here. The fight at the end between Robocop and the other robot is rather cool to...though it is a bit of a throwback to claymation or stop motion at times. The story has this new drug on the streets and corrupt business is at it again. You also have Robocop briefly reunited with his wife, he also gets a bit tore up again. You have a mysterious criminal and his kid sidekick, a team working on the next Robocop, the original Robocop being reprogrammed, a police strike and do you get the feeling there is just a bit much going on here? You also get the stupid commercials, but here they are even worse. Still, you get lots of blood and violence as this is just before the lets make every movie we can pg-13 phase that is still the plague of Hollywood. If they could have just worked on the story a bit and took out some of the elements while focusing more on the drug villains this movie could have been as good as the first. However, this edition of Robocop is a bit of a jumbled mess. Sadly though the next one would be worse as it would feature a robot ninja and a flying robocop.",RoboCop 2
20,Mr-Fusion,"It's not the original, and that's important to remember",6,6 December 2014,"The stop-motion effects in ""RoboCop 2"" are exceptional. Regardless of where you fall on this movie, I think we all have to admit that. And it's Peter Weller returning in the lead role, which goes an awful long way in lending it an air of legitimacy. It's the rest of it that's shaky. For one, the plot is absolute packed (Nuke, Murphy's civic-minded reprogramming, Cain, Hob, RoboCop 2, OCP corporate-raiding Detroit) and it all feels crammed in. The Old Man seems more villainous than necessary and the drug- dealing kid is . . . he's awful. But that's because I'm comparing it to the first movie. Really, what this does (as a sequel) is take the superhero movie route; it's right there in the score. I think that's the reason why the media satire feels way off. This isn't a great movie, but it does feel like a snapshot of 1990 (maybe it's just me) and a film that's trying to set itself apart from its predecessor. For better or worse.6/10",RoboCop 2

22,Smells_Like_Cheese,I didn't know whether to laugh or be excited,4,27 January 2007,"I finally had the opportunity to see the Robocop sequels since my friend purchase the trilogy on DVD, I normally like to see the sequels if I was into the first film, like most movie buffs. I couldn't believe my eyes watching this film or listening to it, I mean I love a good action movie, who doesn't? Well, I know there are a few who don't, but it's all good. But anyways, this movie was a little bit just a little bit over the top. I mean is it that realistic that there are that many explosions in one day? I'm talking like on the same block or city?Basically there is a new drug on the market called Nuke, a drug that is supposed to create like a paradise for people in their minds. To make matters worse is that the Detroit cops have gone strike for low salaries and horrible equipment, but OCP are not giving in, they in fact want to make another robocop but cannot find a willing participate to sign up for the project. Robocop is brutally torn apart by the group who is in control of the Nuke drug but he gets put back together and wants to make the city safe once again, well, then again, it's Detroit, right? Robocop 2 is just action, nothing more, sometimes it's fun like Con Air or the first Robocop, but sometimes it doesn't succeed. But it's all up to you to decide, like I said, sometimes people have different tastes or just wanted to see the sequels like me. So I'm not going to recommend it or say stay away from it, because quite frankly I just can't decide.4/10",RoboCop 2
23,MovieAddict2016,"An OK movie, but Verhoeven's absence is quite apparent, and it is nowhere near as great as its terrific predecessor...",10,30 October 2003,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***""RoboCop"" is one of my all-time favorite guilty pleasures, the type of rare action movie that takes no prisoners and never lets up for a single moment until the ride is over, and when the credits start to fill the screen you just let out a big sigh of relief--not because it was a bad film, but because you survived the ride.""RoboCop 2"" is a bit different. Gone is Paul Verhoeven at the helm of the film and filling in for his absence is Irvin Kershner (""The Empire Strikes Back""). The film is violent, perhaps a bit more so than the first in certain areas overall, but it lacks the hard, almost unexplainable solid edge the first film had--the sharpness that pierces you as you watch the film like a knife blade. ""RoboCop 2"" has a dull blade. The first has a great effect. This does not. There's violence without reason, reason without explanation, and explanation without effect.Detroit is worse off than it was in the last film--men bash little old ladies with cars and steal their loot; hookers stab men in the eye to steal cash; stores are blown up and rampages by little league players and the captain of the team even occur. Police are on strike because they claim the city is screwing them over--only RoboCop (Peter Weller), Lewis (Nancy Allen), and a few other policemen/women remain.There's a new drug on the rise called ""Nuke,"" manufactured and sold to the public by Cain (Tom Noonan) and his young apprentice (Gabriel Damon), who looks about 11 or 12 but talks with the language of a Quentin Tarantino character and kills innocent human beings mercilessly. Oh, but when he dies we're supposed to feel sorry for him because then he's a cute little mortally-wounded boy.RoboCop chases down Cain and, after what seems two hours into the film, finally catches him. But Omni Corp, the corporation we saw in the first film, wants a new RoboCop, so they shut down life support on the dying Cain, take his brain and stuff it into a new RoboCop, referenced to so originally as ""RoboCop 2,"" hence the title of the film. (My suggestion is that in ""RoboCop 4,"" they should create a cyborg called RoboCop XP, and he can have lightning-fast reflexes and a built-in wireless broadband modem so he can check his e-mails and surf the 'Net while he's on the go.)And putting a homicidal drug dealer's brain inside a giant-sized robot law enforcer with machine gun capabilities and weapons of mass destruction probably isn't a very good idea, but the thought never crosses the minds of Omni Corp. The chairman of Omni Corp (Daniel O'Herlihy) produces RoboCop 2 to the public, but RoboCop already realizes RoboCop 2 is dangerous and so he appears at the unveiling armed with a huge gun.RoboCop 2 goes haywire and kills everyone. The entire sequence is done in cheesy Godzilla animation but, to be quite honest, it didn't look all that bad. He and RoboCop duke it out on top of buildings and in elevator shafts and on the ground outside Omni Corp, where an uncountable number of police officers (hey, weren't they on strike?) are left firing at this indestructible--and very bulletproof--machine that unfortunately does not have an OFF switch in sight. (""Turn it off!"" he says. ""I can't!"" she says. ""You idiots!"" I say.)So many loose threads are left dangling in ""RoboCop 2,"" and so many subject matters that I wanted sorting out after seeing the first film. But there isn't any hope in sight. After a brief moment that hints towards the central idea that RoboCop may still be human after all (wasn't that sorta established in the original?), everything is dropped for the action set pieces to move in, such as a car chase with RoboCop and Cain, or the end finale that goes on too long. But RoboCop is seen spying on his wife in the beginning, and we find out that she has gone through serious trauma over this whole thing. She confronts him at the police station and out of decency he insists her husband is dead. But we see the look of remembrance and remorse in his eyes.That's the storyline I would like to follow. I'd like to follow RoboCop's journey to find himself again, to recover lost memories floating around in that big brain of his. To confront his wife and tell her that he remembers her, to add a human element to the story that was so clearly demonstrated in the original but completely lost here. Kershner obviously wants to mimic Verhoeven. But Verhoeven knows how to equally balance action and excessive gore with social satire and the ongoing human battles, relevant to the action battles. Remember in the first film when RoboCop went through his house and his eyes started to flood with past images and faded memories? Nothing like that is done here. We simply get some cheesy flashback in the beginning when Alex (pre-RoboCop) is laughing with his wife in a very non-candid and dubious sort of way. As I saw this sequence, I just sat in my seat waiting for the word ""Hallmark"" to appear in gold font across the screen.As for all the loose threads left open in this film and supposedly not touched in the third movie...let's all hope that when Paul Verhoeven said he wishes to return to the series he wasn't lying. I'd love to see this franchise closed in a more honorable fashion. ""RoboCop 2"" is an OK movie for a Friday night crowd, but in comparison with the original, it's about as cold as RoboCop's facial tissue and as cloudy as RoboCop's memory.2.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",RoboCop 2

Cause this sequel is inferior to the first ""Robocop"" movie in some aspects. While the first movie in this franchise is brilliant, that isn't the case for this sequel. This isn't a terrible sequel though but far from being good as the original and passable as sequels go, but it just wasn't as effective. Even if it tries to make things bigger with more explosions, there just isn't much build up. The movie also tries to involve kids for the younger audiences, but that wasn't a good idea since the kids just come off annoying to watch and the connection with the main plot was off and looked cheap. If you seen the original and expecting something that equals to the original or even better will be left disappointed. However there are some decent aspects to this sequel and has a bit of entertainment value. The action sequences are also good for it's time and overall it's a worthy sequel just not a great one.7/10",RoboCop 2

27,lost-in-limbo,"""I am a machine. Nothing more"".",7,5 August 2011,"Paul Verhoeven's ""RoboCop"" was a groundbreaking success blending its brutal violence, dark humour and satirically biting ideas in to an excitingly evocative Sci-fi classic. The sequel might not match the imprint (although its ricocheting firepower does) and wit of its predecessor, but still it's a candidly worthy follow-up by writer Frank Miller and director Irvin Kushner (""The Empire Strikes Back""). It's frenetic and boisterous with its explosions, automatic gunfire and warped sense of humour. Criminals run amok in a crime-decayed Detroit (which even sees children getting involved) and corruption spills out from its town hall to a powerful company OCP, where half of the police force is on strike. So to hand out justice RoboCop is at work. Peter Weller returns as RoboCop with a blue metallic glow, adding a more humane angle but staying convincing with the quirks that made his character memorable. Tom Noonan laps it up in the villainous drug-lord role Cain, keeping it steadily collected but the cold malevolent demeanour shows up in some sequences and especially when his brain is transported in a cyborg that obeys due to its drug-addiction. Nancy Allen offers solid support. Then there's a terrific Belinda Bauer who's icy portrayal as an ambitious Dr. looking to replace RoboCop with her own model. Gabriel Damon and Galyn Gorg are good in their parts as part of Cain's gang. Don O'Herlihy and Felton Perry suitably reprise their roles as OCP executives. Also there are small to tiny parts for Willard E. Pugh, Ken Lerner, Fabiana Udenio, Mark Rolston and John Glover. Millar's blunt material while smart doesn't have the venomous bite, but keeps a mean-streak and storms up some thoughtful and amusing scenarios like the scenes of RoboCop remembering who he originally was and then the polite program changes to his memory back. Then there's the ""King Kong"" like climax, which feels like a homage of sorts. Streaming from it is violently ballsy cartoon-like essence to it all. Technically it's poignantly efficient where by accommodating with thrillingly bombastic action (especially when RoboCop goes up against RoboCop 2), heated-up by outstanding special effects and lingering with remarkably intense camera-work by Mark Irwin. Seedily hostile entertainment.""Freeze! This is a bust"".",RoboCop 2
28,Robert_duder,A worthy and well made sequel to an action classic,8,14 June 2008,"If I had just seen Robocop, the original film, for the first time back in 1988 I would have said that any attempt at a sequel would fall flat and not even come close to being as good as the original. Some of it seemed like fluke with it's dark humor and campy spoofing on society in general. So it's with great respect I say that they DID manage to create a sequel nearly as good as the original and certainly just as much fun to watch. Robocop 2 has to face a lot of problems that second installments to Superhero films have to face. There is no creation of the hero, no background necessary so the action has to be non stop and the villain has to be something powerful and noteworthy and the creators of Robocop 2 did both flawlessly. Irvin Kershner helms the film this time around and he might be better known as the director of The Empire Strikes Back so he's no newcomer by any means. He still manages to keep the story gritty and dark and yet give Robocop even more of a human feel to him. In many ways he's an even better hero than in the first film. The tongue in cheek humor is definitely in tact although perhaps not as well delivered as it was in the original. Still the campy little commercials, the news breaks (starring Leeza Gibbons returning to her role from the original), Robocop's dry one liners and the sound effects all make for a hilarious dark action.Peter Weller thankfully returns to his role because he really does encompass Robocop and I can't imagine anyone else playing him although several other actors do. Weller gets to do a little more with the emotions and some really kick butt action scenes in this one. Belinda Bauer plays the lesser of villains Dr. Faxx. She doesn't get a lot of screen time but she also doesn't do a lot with the time that she's given. She's just okay. Tom Noonan is the lead villain of sorts who eventually becomes Robocop 2. Noonan is more impressive as the CGI robot than he is as the actual person. He's decent and he looks the part and he's appropriately evil but doesn't really match what Kurtwood Smith did with his villain in the original. Nancy Allen also returns as Robocop partner Lewis. She is as good as she was in the original but doesn't get as much screen time. She is still the perfect partner for him. Her and Weller have terrific chemistry even as partner and robot. The real scene stealer is fourteen year old Gabriel Damon who plays Kane's right hand boy Hob. Hob is a better main villain than all of them put together. He's downright evil and disturbing and because Robocop won't take on kids he's a deadly adversary. His performance is downright amazing and really over shadows anyone who shares screen time with him. Dan O'Herlihy also returns as the head of O.C.P. (The Old Man) as he is known. He hasn't changed a bit and his character is an awesome addition to the cast. Felton Perry also returns as the right hand man in OCP.They did everything right with this sequel. Brought back some of the original cast, brought in new villains, upped the budget, upped the body count and the gore and exploded everything in sight but still maintained a strong story. Robocop 2 is an awesome sequel and it's easy to see why people wanted more from them. The last half hour might be the best of the entire film as Robocop goes toe to toe with Robocop 2 in the form of Kane. The film holds nothing back as 80's films always don't. Kids are criminals, violence is rampant and it's a helluva good time. Some of the death scenes in the film are brutally disturbing much like the first one. Robocop takes a guy's eye out through the scope of his sniper rifle. Regardless of how future installments panned out I am hooked on Robocop and the first two films are brilliant!! 8.5/10",RoboCop 2
29,bowmanblue,Should have been so much better,7,25 September 2018,"The original 'Robocop' film probably never deserved to be as good as it turned out. It was totally a B-movie that just seemed to come together brilliantly in the perfect storm of over-the-top bloodthirsty action with even a sprinkling of political satire and social commentary thrown in there for good measure. I sometimes wonder whether the film-makers even predicted how popular it would be, hence they never bargained on a sequel so quickly after the first. However, even back then sequels were big business and the studio threw one out as soon as possible.In short: a lot of people hated 'Robocop 2.' Yeah, I have to admit, it doesn't seem to come anywhere near capturing the atmosphere and feel of the original. However, it's probably not (quite) as bad as most people make out. If you liked the first then you'll probably enjoy this one, especially now you can either view it cheap of online as part of a streaming service.The first film was set in the near future in a run-down Detroit where the police department was privatised and farmed out to a money-grabbing firm called OCP. They decided to try and aid their law-enforcement money-making programme by creating robot police officers and, when unlucky subject Alex Murphy was 'killed' in the line of duty, what was left of his remains were used to create the titular cyborg. The film was good because it had a perfect beginning, middle and end (again, something that leads me to believe that a sequel was never intended). The conclusion was truly satisfying, which goes some why to explain why people were so annoyed that 'Part 2' effectively ignores most character development and starts the same story again... only not as well.It's the story that lets it down. In short... it's a bit of a mess. I hear a few writers gave their input on the script (and it shows!), including legendary comic book guru Frank Millar (who I believe gets credited, although there's debate as to how much of his story remains). It's starts off pretty well. In the first film Robocop slowly regained his humanity and remembered his family and life before his change. This carries on until it doesn't. It sort of gets dropped quite quickly in favour of going in a completely different direction where Robocop gets reprogrammed with more 'politically correct' directives. This is quite funny, but it all seems a bit unnecessary as he soon recovers from that.There's also no clear villain. Okay, so you could say that it's Kane - a drug dealer Robocop is trying to catch. Only, it's not just him in human form, but also the corrupt and uncaring OCP executives, bad cops and even the Mayor turns to criminal activities. They really should have picked one (probably Kane) and stuck to him. Only, Kane sort of goes out of it three quarters of the way through (no spoilers as to why and how - you'll see). Other characters also come and go, most notably Robocop's human partner Lewis, who could have been cut altogether. Then there's the only redeemable OCP executive 'Johnson' from the first film, who comes back only to act completely different and no explanation is offered as to his motivational change.
The story in general is pretty far-fetched (if you're okay with suspending your disbelief into thinking that robots are real). OCP wants to create an upgraded Robocop (imaginatively called 'Robocop 2' believe it or not) so they decide to put a criminal's brain into the next version of the droid instead of a police officer's (ala 'Robocop 1'). If this seems a little stupid then you're right. Who can't see what's going to happen?!Yes, the end battle is quite well done, especially for the film's time (no major CGI here!) and it's kind of worth it for that, but there's a real sense of lacking a pay-off. Many storylines aren't that well concluded (maybe they were thinking of ending these in another sequel?) and the film kind of ends exactly where the first one did, making the whole sequel kind of redundant. However, like I say, it's an okay outing if you're in the mood for more Robocop. Besides, the spoof adverts throughout the whole film are as amusing as before and, if you compare 'Robocop 2' to 'Robocop 3' then this is actually a masterpiece!",RoboCop 2
30,gbill-74877,Not good,4,8 November 2021,"Decent enough effects, but a confused mess of a story that would be a waste of time to summarize. The original cast is here with some unfortunate additions; the character of the pre-adolescent boy in the gang pushing a new drug was a disaster, and poisons every scene he appears in. The film is shaky in both its humor and its drama, and there are a couple of histrionic performances that aren't funny or dramatic, so the tone felt all over the map. Meanwhile, the little ads inserted to provide dystopian commentary are pale reflections of Verhoeven's original film, and there is no clarity of thought in the script or how the story is told. The only original idea it had was the corporation playing hardball to take over the assets of Detroit and ""take it private,"" which I perked up over, given the consequences we're living with today for related things that were ramping up in this period (e.g. Privatization of education, for-profit health care insurance) ... but nothing really comes of this. The film is more interested in extended action sequences and a kitchen-sink approach, hoping something will stick. It's a waste of time, and I was very glad when it was over.",RoboCop 2
31,lesleyharris30,"Horrible Sequel,",4,14 August 2013,"Robocop 2 is a terrible movie with a ridiculous storyline that is too long (almost two hours) and an uninspired cast that are only in it for the money.The only scenes that I enjoyed in anyway are Peter Weller's parts,but he isn't even in it that much,he's in the first half and after that it starts focusing more on the humans,Robocop is the title character,and if his name is in the movies title,he should be in it more than anyone else.The worst part about this movie is the cheesy special effects,and especially Nancy Allen,she wasn't great in the first Robocop,but she's even worse in this,she is a terrible actress only says her lines.I also didn't like the strong use of children in this,it was just creepy seeing such young kids as criminals.Robocop 2 is a stupid sequel that I would not recommend to fans of the original.While the crime rate is only getting worse,Robocop is destroyed and replaced by a newer model,they try their best to put him back together as more memories of being Alex Murphy come back to him.",RoboCop 2
32,CuriosityKilledShawn,And now...a word on nutrition,10,10 February 1999,"RoboCop 2 is probably the most under-rated and most harshly criticized sequel in history (tying with Predator 2, which came out the same year). Because of a few missing elements from the first and a slightly more cartoonish approach to the violence, the critics and public alike were not pleased and opinions and feelings toward the franchise nosedived with the just plain awful RoboCop 3.Don't con yourself out of a good movie though. RoboCop 2 still has the same savage sense of humor, cynical social commentary and character pathos of the first film. It's a hyper-realistic vision of an America populated by gun-loving psychos, a democracy owned by big business and the poverty-stricken addicted to drugs dealt to them by peddlers believing themselves to be the second coming of Christ.Far-fetched could be the typical way of describing it. Completely-over-the-top would be more appropriate. Empire Strikes Back director Irvin Kershner chucks in as much sadistic violence, deafening gunfire, endless destruction and loss of human life that the film just begs you not to take it so seriously.Some of the blame was placed on writer Frank Miller for the film being more cartoonish than the original. I don't think this is very fair. I read Miller's original script when I was in high school and it is rather different and, dare I say, unfilmable. RoboCop 2 himself was not Nuke Lord Caine, the psychotic hippie with delusions of Godhood. He was called Kong, a psychotic cop who pretty much killed everybody he came across. Sgt. Reed and the Old Man died too, and there wasn't much humor. Screenwriter Walon Green was hired to doctor the script and much of what appears on screen is actually his work. Frank Miller's original ideas are pretty much just left as the framework for the whole movie and some of his story was recycled into RoboCop 3 (don't blame him for that one either). Miller was obviously upset with this but was still a good enough sport to appear in the film (keep a lookout for him playing Doctor Frank), though he vowed not to work in Hollywood again for fear of being taken advantage of. Until Robert Rodriguez promised to make good on his Sin City graphic novels.Verhoven may be gone but Irvin Kershner tries hard to deliver the same mix of mirth and magic and actually does get it right. Basil Poledouris' brooding score is also gone (it returns in RoboCop 3) but new composer Leonard Rosenman creates a wonderfully heroic and upbeat theme that suits the film more than Poledouris' moody, tormented score to the first.There have also been many complaints that the humanity of RoboCop and his relationship with Lewis was neutered along with too many other ideas fighting for screen time. I get why most would be annoyed by this but you have to remember that films need to be economic when it comes to length. If every single idea was fully explored and fleshed-out RoboCop 2 would have been 4 hours long. In my opinion each thread has just enough for keen viewers and fans to appreciate. Lazy viewers only see what they want to see and I feel that this has led to many of the negative reviews the film has been met with (which usually comment on how ""offensive"" the character of Hob is-sheesh, gimme a break). And don't give me that the ""humanity"" of the first film is gone. Murphy has not resigned to being a machine. He lies to pacify OCP. Pay attention to the very last line of dialogue in the film if you want proof.Filmed once again in Texas, Houston this time, you really have to feel for Peter Weller walking around in that Robosuit. It must have weighed a ton and he'd be sweating bucketloads inside. There is a particular scene in the film where Murphy is tortured into near-death/destruction that is very hard to watch. But it does lead to him getting a brand-new makeover and those crazy new directives put into his head. The bit where he lectures the Little League kids and scolds the youngsters playing by the leaky fire hydrant (after quoting some very suspicious philosophy) is hilarious.RoboCop 2 is a great movie. Despite harsh critisisms of the script and story and some slightly dated stop-motion effects it's a brilliant sequel that lives up to expectations. Do listen to the nay-sayers. I don't know what kind of film they were expecting.And thank you for not smoking!",RoboCop 2
33,callanvass,A convoluted mess of a sequel. Were the writers on drugs?,4,22 February 2014,"The cops are on strike, leaving the Cyborg formerly known as Murphy and Officer Lewis (Nancy Allen) to hand out their personal brand of justice. Murphy is told to stop stalking his wife because he is no longer a human. Things get really bad when a drug is going around known as ""Nuke"" A religious nut known as Kane is the culprit. It becomes too much for Murphy to handle , making Dr. Faxx from OCPP to create Robocop II; new and improved, using Kane as the new subjectWhat on earth were they thinking when they created this crap? I can't for the life of me figure out why they thought this was a good idea. They weren't on drugs most likely, but it makes me wonder. The original is one of my favorite movies and I think this one is an insult to the original. There are so many things in this movie that made my head spin. It throws in everything but the kitchen sink in terms of being surreal. It got to the point where it felt like they were being weird for the sake of it. This is something that would NEVER be made today, thank god for that. This movie is so incoherent that I don't even know where to begin. It starts off fairly well with Murphy stalking his wife, leaving me hope that we would learn even more about Murphy's family. Instead, they drop it as soon as it starts to get good. I pined for more of that, it was rather riveting. It's like they knew the script was crap, and just decided to throw in as many crazy things as they could. There are some decent action scenes. The finale is very good, but it runs overlong and far too much dullness in between. Paul Verhoeven's presence is clearly lacking in this one. Ostensibly, he was offered to direct Robocop II, but turned it down when they wanted to rush into a sequel. What a shame. More problems include a humorless script that throws in plenty of ghastly violence, but barely any humor. The only thing that amused me is when Dr. Faxx tinkers with his mechanics and makes Robocop overly chipper. The nuke drug had major potential, but they didn't do enough with it. The performances are fine. Peter Weller has more to play with than the original, but, since the script is all over the place, it kind of lets him down. He did very well with what he is given. Nancy Allen is somewhat of a caricature of her character from the first film. She doesn't look too thrilled to be in this movie, and it shows. Belinda Bauer is wooden and annoying as Dr. Faxx. Tom Noonan's villain part is rather thin, but he is fun. Gabriel Damon is given a big role as a villain. The only problem was that he's a KID. It didn't offend me or anything, just thought it was rather distasteful. Final Thoughts: They should have never made this movie. The original was almost impossible to equal and they shouldn't have even tried. Verhoeven could have made a good sequel, but they crapped all over it instead. This movie is like a bad trip from a strong drug. Shockingly, this movie isn't even the worst in the series. That dubious honor belongs to Robocop III4.8/10",RoboCop 2
34,The-Sarkologist,This series simply gets better and better,9,8 November 2013,"This is the middle movie in the Robocop trilogy and we learn that things are getting far worse. The world is going to hell, as usual, but in Detroit, the city is bankrupt and owes millions of dollars to OCP and OCP is threatening foreclosure on the city if the debts are not paid. A new drug, Nuke, is on the streets, and the leader of the Nuke Cult, Kane, is actively trying to addict people and prevent people from getting off of the drug. This goes to firebombing clinics and killing the surgeon general. The police are also on strike so crime is getting worse. We also learn that nobody can create a second Robocop as all of the candidates end up going psychotic and killing themselves. A psychologist appears and tells the Old Man that she has an idea and sets about creating a new Robocop.OCP in this movie is much worse than the first movie, but in this movie they are taking the centre stage and the Nuke Cult, though apparently they appear to be the main bad guys in the movie, being their mainly for support. It becomes evident though that the Nuke Cult is a side issue because the real bad guy is the Old Man. He doesn't land up dead or in gaol, in fact he gets away, but we learn that much of what is happening in Detroit is due to his manipulations. By the end of the movie, we see that OCP has been moulded into what appears to be a fascist organisation. The huge red flags and the black security guards drum up images of the Nazi regime.The other important bad guy is in fact a woman: the psychologist. Through her we delve deeper into Robocop's mind to try and understand the struggle that he is going through. We appreciate his strength of mind when we notice that others put through this cannot handle it and kill themselves. Only two people, Murphy and Kane, survived the process. Kane survived it because he is a psychotic maniac who believes that he is God and welcomed the immorality. They thought that they could control him, but realised they could not, especially since the Old Man unknowingly waved a cannister of nuke in front of him. Even then, he did not believe that the Robocop units had any personality.As I said before, we delve much deeper into Robocop's psyche. We learn that he is struggling with his memories of his life, and following his wife causing her trauma. He wants her back but knows that he cannot have her. He is a machine and cannot give her the love of a husband. When he finally confronts her, he lets her know that her husband is dead, but even though that is the case, others still call him Murphy. What is really good is the way that they psychologically manipulate Robocop, attacking him in the area that he struggles with the most - his death.The final thing that impressed me was the problem that the city is in, and there is no simple solution out of it. They try everything and end up having to resort to making deals with the drug lords of Detroit. Unfortunately it isn't that easy because they are busted by Robocop II and then exposed to the media. At the end of the movie, this problem is not solved and OCP seems to still be going strong. What happens? We need to watch the third movie.",RoboCop 2
35,Movie Nuttball,Good sequel to RoboCop!,10,31 October 2002,"The Sequel to RoboCop is a good one with more violence.Perter Weller and Nancy Allen both do as good Dan O'Herlihy,as they did in the original. Thomas Rosales Jr once again gets shot up in this movie which was no suprise to Me because in most of the films he is in he either gets killed or is behind bars.Tom Noonan is the villain this time around and is a good one at that!

36,leplatypus,2 Robocops are not worthy of Robocop 1 (dad),7,11 November 2016,"This sequels has clearly not the punch of Verhoeven's original ! Right from the start, you can feel that the franchise gets down from anticipation-philosophical-tragic-acid movie to simple fun, action-packed one ! By chance, the production is skilled and experimented so you can watch the movie : Kershner and Tippet really put Robocop on spotlight, Bauer is a memorable shrink but at the end, the big disappointment is the star of comics, Frank Miller who wrote a story that is just too similar with the original : so Miller wrote about an OCP ambitious corporate who wants to be number 2 with a new Robocop project: already told in 1987 ! He wrote also about a gang leader whose hideout is a derelict factory : already told in 1987 ! We have Robocop making an assault in a drug laboratory : already told in 1987! We have a street exploded by criminality: already told in 1987 ! we have Robocop going into the leader hide-out and being badly wounded and later coming back and arresting him : already told in 1987 ! At last, the finale is Robocop battling the other OCP robot in an OCP building and that was already the ending in 1987 ! So it's really hard to find the creativity of Miller here, especially when he later wrote the excellent Robocop / Terminator story ! Things gets really bad when this gang leader is played ridiculously with a stupid bunch as well (a teen, a sort of Elvis, a sort of Elektra !) So it's a disappointing sequel and honestly, this blue metallic Robocop is a bit too much too and we miss greatly Poledouris!",RoboCop 2
37,marmar-69780,robocop 2,4,12 January 2020,"Robocop 2 is a lame made sequel compared to the great first one,while original had big emotional impact to care for this character,this one doesnt have that,robocop in this film feels more like a superhero and not as human being who never wanted this,becase of that his human side wasnt represented well or it was basiacly ignored if you want,villains were laughable i mean how can a kid over power a grown up police officer last time i checked he didnt have superhuman strenght,and while effects in first one were not so great in this they were far worser and lazier ,this film in end felt like another one that didnt leave up to original",RoboCop 2
38,Anonymous_Maxine,Yet another sophomore effort that falls flat on it face.,4,3 February 2003,"Robocop 2 starts off with planet Detroit in the worst shape ever. The entire police force is on strike, which seems like an entirely too convenient start for a Robocop film, but then we see that there is actually a believable reason for them all to be on strike. Planet Detroit is so deeply in debt to the evil empire Omni Consumer Products that they are unable to pay the police, who go on strike until the debts can be paid. Unfortunately, this plot is largely ignored in favor of a rivalry which develops between Robocop and Cain, an insane gangster who plans to force the city to legalize the ridiculously addictive drug Nuke so that he can flood the city with it to the point where everyone becomes hopelessly addicted to it and he becomes so rich and powerful that he can pay the city's debt and become its king.
This is, unfortunately, the only way that the subplot of Cain and his plans is attached to the far more interesting financial plight of the city, which has become copless but at least has an interesting problem to solve. Instead, the movie focuses on this criminal underworld with Robocop as the only cop who is willing or able to get in and do something about it. The movie wins hands down the Worst Taste of the Year award by throwing in a vicious twelve-year-old who is put into the movie for no other reason than so he can spout a lot of profanity and give us a real test to see how much we can really take before we give up and walk out of the theater.Obviously it would take a lot more than a financial debt for a city like Detroit to be denied its police force so that criminals were able to run rampant in the streets, not hindered by any laws whatsoever, but keep in mind that the Detroit in the Robocop films is not attached to the rest of the United States. It is, in fact, an entirely separate planet, which becomes increasingly obvious as the sequels get poured on. Peter Weller has thankfully returned to once again take on the uncomfortable role of Robocop, who still has the same overall look but now for some reason sports a shiny new blue paintjob, which does nothing but make him look plastic.
There is a brief point in the film where the human emotions that always remained in Murphy after he was made into Robocop come up, as he drives by his house lovingly spying on his wife (who, through Murphy's flashbacks, is thought to be dead through much of the original film), to the point where she actually takes out a restraining order and Robocop has to be reprimanded and has to recite back to his programmers that he is not a human, he is a machine. Not a lot of thought put into this scene, by the way. You would think that, given all of the goofy comedy that is put into this movie, a more witty writer would have had Robocop say, `I am not human. I am a machine. I did, after all, build and program myself, so I should really know better.'After this brilliant scene, Robocop is completely reprogrammed (maybe they thought he was getting smart with them and decided that they better punish him), so they implant every bit of goofy polite mannerism into him to make him easier to relate to the human public, and the movie immediately turns from being a bad action film to being an even worse comedy. Robocop walks around saying Hello how are you and beautiful morning isn't it, it would be a shame to waste it, and goes out trying to be polite to people on the street, only to have even children playing in the street immediately lose all respect for him to the point where they spray paint `KIK ME' on his back in bright orange paint. At least they were nice enough to use disappearing paint, which is visible immediately after they paint him and then never again for the rest of the film.(spoilers) In the original film, Robocop had a wonderful and worthy adversary, ED209, who is now replaced by another robot who is created out of the body of Cain, the super-villain from the earlier portion of the movie. Yeah, the drug lord that wanted to flood the city with Nuke and take it over is being granted another chance at life as well as an astronomical amount of firepower, no doubt the same line of deductive logic that led the diminished police force to weigh down the `Splatterpunks' with weapons in part 3. You can tell a lot of thought went into THAT. So we are presented with an evil-looking robot who is supposedly supposed to take over after Robocop, who has committed the crime of still loving his ex-wife.The fact that this robot is presented as a solution to ANY problem pretty clearly illustrates the kind of thinking that has led Detroit down the pit that it lies in, and it doesn't look like things are going to get better with stuff like this going on. Indeed, all they'll have is more and more problems but I suppose that they figure they can at least make more sequels and maybe make some money that way. For the most part, Robocop 2 is a complete failure, not really accomplishing anything other than finding a job for a guy who's specialty is playing the violin with his legs behind his head (If you can play the violin like THIS guy, you might be a redneck!). It takes the Robocop story and stupidly tries to take it in a completely new direction (a direction which turns out to be flat out wrong) rather than build upon the genius of the original. I try as much as I can to avoid clichés in my reviews, but this is a perfect example of a time when you would enjoy your self more if you just watched the original again.",RoboCop 2
39,Vartiainen,Decent sequel,5,2 May 2014,"The original RoboCop is a cult classic. A perfect blend of social satire, high-end violence, special effects and intriguing character concepts. So it was never all that likely the sequel would be just as good. But to their credit they stuck to what worked and managed to produce this above average science action film. It's not quite as good as the original, but it has a lot of its good elements in it and even the new stuff manages to impress from time to time.It's some time after the events of the original film and Omni Consumer Products (OCP for short) is up to no good once again, this time manipulating the police force of the city to force in their new Delta City. And at the same time new drug is spreading in the city's underworld. Once again it's up to RoboCop to put a halt to these new threats. Along the way we get gun fights, cool special effects (at least for their time), crazy characters and high stages.So what works? Peter Weller and Nancy Allen reprise their roles as RoboCop and Officer Lewis, respectively, and they're both great, managing to reach the same sense of camaraderie as they did in the first film. Furthermore, the film is once again sound on the technical side of things. Some of the goriness and the distinctive soundtrack have been removed, which makes the film seem a bit more generic, but it's not a huge flaw. I also quite liked Hob (Gabriel Damon), the kid lieutenant of the criminal overlord. It's not often we see a young child this ruthless and mad with power. Some might object that it's wrong, taboo even, to use a kid in such a role, but I don't really see why this is any different than us seeing someone blow up. It's just as unsettling and meant to be like that.And what doesn't work? The story, unfortunately. It's serviceable and I applaud them from continuing the storyline, but it just isn't as interesting as the original. The novelty has worn off and it feels like they're treading same old ground once again. The villains, with the exception of Hob, aren't as interesting either and as already stated, some of the distinct feel has been lost in the process of trying to make the film more approachable to wider audiences.Still, for what it is, it's a pleasing experience. Are you a fan of the original film and want to see more? Then this one is an easy recommendation.",RoboCop 2
40,GOWBTW,"Different, yet just as entertaining!",9,2 February 2007,"The first ""Robocop"" was great. This one is a little more challenging. Robocop(Peter Weller) is back on the streets protecting the citizens of Old Detroit as usual. This time he's fighting the spread of a new drug known as ""Nuke"" that is being distributed by a dealer named Cain(Tom Noonan). During a confrontation with Robocop: Van vs. motorcycle, Cain is critically injured. Then suddenly, an OCP operative kills Cain and puts his mind in her newest creation: ""Robocop 2"". Since dead cops often to lose their sanity, the doctor decided to who convicted felons instead. Bad Idea! When Cain returns to his comrades, he wipes them all out, including the errand boy Hob(Gabriel Damon), whom he always trusted. When Robocop found him in the van all shot up, Hob tells him ""Dying Sucks"". He kinda learned his lesson a little too late. OCP will soon get a rude awakening at the display of Robocop 2. All it wanted is the Nuke. When the creator sees the first one she says, ""You're obsolete!"" it's because, ""She's corrupt!"" Those two cyborgs really duke it out, Robocop 2 may have the arsenal, but the first one got the wits. Robocop took out his shoulder cannon with ease. It appears that the OCP trust is about to totally shrink there. This one has more violence than the first, and the action is pretty much steady, and unlike the first, there's some humor to it to keep it from being boring. Rating 4 out of 5 stars!",RoboCop 2
41,hellraiser7,Battle Bots,9,23 August 2012,"One of the things I love about Superhero sagas are that they are always open to continuation. Whenever I'm done with one story I always wait in anticipation for the next and I'm always wondering what will happen next, this sequel didn't disappoint me yeah I know I'm probably in the minority on this but I think this is a really good if criminally underrated sequel.There are just a lot of things I really like about it the fact the script is written by one of my favorite comic book writers ""Frank Miller"". I've read the graphic novel which was based on his original idea of the sequel, that version I felt was better despite not being made. But I still really like this sequel all the same I think it's good in it's own way, I consider this sequel scenario B in my book.But getting down more to the jist of it, The score is great, I love the new theme of Robocop there is slightly more light touch to it where it still has that epic heroic tone but also slight comic book sensibility to it.I like the really really dark setting, we see that OCP has really fraked up bad, Detroit City practically looks like ""Hell on Earth"", everything is just completely out of control there is crime left and right, let alone one too many lawbreakers enough to give Robo a field day. The fact that the cops are on strike unfortunately give big crime organizations an edge.I love the use of satire and humor which another of the best things about the franchise. From the commercials my favorite one is the Magna Volt commercial with host John Glover, yeah I'd get that security system for my car. Another was seeing Robocop reprogrammed into being a Dudley Do Right like character, it was both surreal and hilarious but was a satire on the fallibility of censorship and pacifism.The parallel between both the criminal organization and OCP just like in the first is still there, the goal is the same to make money lots of it, despite how many lives they destroy in the process. But it's also to make things better even though they overlook the flaw in their ambitions. Cain's ambition is to bring Paridise to the world despite how hazardous his Nuke substance is, OCP's is to build Delta City despite how nice the plan looks it also means neighborhoods would be torn down and even businesses would be shut down or bought out. There is even a couple of moment that cement the parallel when there is a Nuke case labeled ""Made in America"" Cain then says, ""Were going to make that mean something again."" And of course the same label is brought up again by the Old Man in the grand presentation scene and he says the same thing. I feel that just shows how Greed is a narcotic.Characters are good. Robocop is still well Robocop, giving criminals exactly what they deserve. As well as Anne Lewis, I like that she gets to do a bit more action this time. And I even like the new villains Cain (played well by Tom Nonnan) whom is really creepy and despite really smart is also completely wacko from his Messiah complex. However the one villain I really like that I thought stole the show was Hob (Gabrel Damon) Cain's heir/apprentice I think. He's awesome and just a darkly fun and funny villain. From his foul mouthed charisma, leadership skills, but I love that weapon of his the collapsible Uzi. That wouldn't work in real life but it's fun to think it could.The special effects as usual are awesome, there is no CGI. I love the use of model and stop motion effects. As well as some of the gore effects and chirography. The highlight and payoff no doubt is the final fight between both Robocop and Robocop 2, it was just awesome it's one of my favorite battles ever because of it's unrelenting intensity and it's variation in arenas of battle, almost like a battle in a Shonen Anime. It's sort of like a ""Transformers"" battle because this is two robots against one another, well OK there was ED-209 in the first film, but Robocop 2 I feel is a match for Robo, I love the design of Robocop 2, from the capabilities, it's size which makes it intimidating, and certain features like his head which looks like an Nazi Gustapo Helmet which in a way implies irony. But anyway practically all hell breaks loose both are just their just shooting the crap out of each other, they go though walls and floors, it even goes to the city streets of Detroit, cops are joining in the fight, there are explosions and multiple casualties it's just completely crazy but awesome.The only misfire of the film is in that scene where both Alex Murphy/Robocop and his wife Elen have a meeting, that scene did nothing for the film and just felt like one that should of been deleted, since the film wasn't even going to bother tackling Robo's human dilemma like in the first film why even have it at all.Robocop 2 despite not quite as good as the first it still has enough firepower to get the job done.Rating: 3 and a half stars",RoboCop 2
42,Captain_Couth,Revenge of the 80's: The Sequel.,7,21 February 2005,"Robocop 2 (1990) was a sequel to the surprise and twisted black comedy hit Robocop. This is a very dark sequel. The humor that made the first film is missing and it is overtly violent. A pretty sadistic movie that's lacking in many places. Too bad they had to make a sequel and produce it without the elements they made the first film a true classic.Detroit City is in a far worse situation than the first film. Whilst part one had a glimmer of hope at the end, it was all naught. O.C.P. is even more of a cruel corporation and they're not showing enough profit from the Robocop program. They tried to make cheaper and more cost efficient version but they all end in horrific failure. Meanwhile a new super designer drug is flooding the streets creating all sorts of havoc for the defenseless citizens and out gunned and out manned police department. Can Robocop once again come back and save the day?Not a bad sequel but when compared to the first film it has no legs to stand on. The film makers tried tweaking the sequel and make it a bit different but it just didn't work. Watchable but not an instant classic. The film is just too dark and sadistic. Mixing those with a comic book movie doesn't work nine times out of ten. Followed by a kid friendly sequel that sat on the shelf for two and a half years.Recommended for masochists and Robocop fans only.",RoboCop 2
43,freemantle_uk,Watchable,6,11 January 2014,"The original 1987 is a beloved sci-fi action film, made at a time when action movies were allowed to be violence and filled with satirical comedy thanks to the skills of director Paul Verhoeven. The sequel tries to repeat the success but Irvin Kershner is unable to match Verhoeven's skills.The Detroit of the future is a cesspool of crime, delinquency, poverty and urban decay. The city is broke and OCP are planning to take over the government, the police are on strike because of wage and pension cuts and a new powerful drug known as Nuke is on the streets, controlled by a cult leader, Cain (Tom Noonan). Only Robocop (Paul Weller) is able to hold the peace, but a scientist at OCP, Dr. Faxx (Belinda Bauer) sees Robocop as being obsolete and wants him replaced by Robocop II, but sees the best candidates to be psychopaths.The filmmakers of Robocop 2 wanted to recapture the satirical and comic elements of the first film, even using the news reports and fake adverts but it felt like the heart or belief behind the ideals like Verhoeven had. It was more shoehorned into the film then actually trying to saying anything about society of the time. There are also attempts at satire when a PR team think how best to reprogram Robocop, making a overly cheery creation who is unable to do any crime fighting because of the conflicting directives. These plot points about the effects about designing by committee lasts five minutes and does not have any overall bearing on the plot. It could have been cut and they would no effect on the plot.A random scene that also felt like it wanted to be darkly comic but out of place and misjudged was when a little league team are robbing a shop, which is done for comic value. It was just a strange way to try and show how awful and crime infested this world.Kershner is best known for being the director of Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back and he brought a darker tone. The best elements of Robocop 2 is the darker parts of the film, showing the crime work with people stealing and killing each other and the constantly drug dealing and drug use. It does have A Clockwork Orange esque feeling to it as a society on the edge of collapse.One of the most controversial elements is the character Hob (Gabriel Damon), a 12-year-old boy who is a psychopathic killer. The idea of him was sound, that this is an amoral, poverty stricken world that even forces children and teenagers into criminality and violence with Hob being killer or a drug runner for Cain. But he becomes the leader of the gang, when it would been more believable if Hob was a member of a street gang or offer Robocop a challenge because he was a killer but a child so cannot do much about him. Another story problem is the willingness of some characters to go to psychopaths and death row inmates instead of more logically options likes special forces soldiers.The action was very well done and perfectly bloody and violence. There is some excellent use of slow motion animation and special effects: it was detailed and Robocop was given a big challenge in the form of RoboCain, a crazed, powerful robot with weapons and a willingness to cause carnage. Noonan did make an excellent villain throughout the film.Robocop 2 is watchable with its violence and action, but it no way near matching the original film and needed a tidy, more thought-out screenplay.",RoboCop 2
44,dee.reid,"Not worse than ""RoboCop"", just different",8,5 December 2002,"""RoboCop 2"" , the sequel to 1987's ultra-violent ""RoboCop"", is not quite up to par with its predecessor.  The film still manages to entertain on a large level.  I know that a lot of people do not like this movie, but I personally think it is still pretty good.  I'm not writing a review of this movie, I am just expressing my thoughts on it.First off, this movie is a lot more violent than the first ""RoboCop"".  You get scenes of bloody shootings, grisly scenes of torture, and a surgery which I'd rather let you see for yourself than describe here.  Paul Verhoeven does not return to shock his audience with graphic violence and ultra dark humor, which has since become trademark in his films.  The director this time is Irvin Kershner, who made ""The Empire Strikes Back"" nearly ten years before this movie.  Kershner seems to focus a lot more on action, rather than story.   Second, the movie's villain, Cain (Tom Noonan), to me is a direct opposite of Clarence Boddicker (the villain from the first film who was played by Kurtwood Smith).  Cain enjoys giving people pleasure (through his highly addictive designer drug called Nuke) while Boddicker was a sadist who took pleasure in the death and suffering of others.  (Though after Cain's ""transformation"", none of this really matters). Lastly, this movie does not exploit children.  The kid in this movie, Hob (played by Garbriel Damon) is Cain's twelve year-old side kick.  He is a violent, foul-mouthed little child who runs errands for Cain.  The writers for this movie did this intentionally, to show that crime holds no age barrier.  Regardless of age, crime is crime. Like I said, ""RoboCop 2"" is not trying to be better than its predecessor, it's just trying to be something different.8/10",RoboCop 2
45,XweAponX,Much better than I remembered.,10,25 January 2018,"Irvin Kershner, who also directed probably the best Star Wars film ""The Empire Strikes Back"", does homage to Verhoeven's directorial style in this first sequel. Apparently Frank Miller wrote the original script, but Kershner didn't use much of it, but Miller hung around anyway.We see many of the original actors return, especially in the OCP offices. The Newsbreak anchors. Also, many new faces. Who cast this? It is a veritable assembly of character actors who had been in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". The Kid from the opening Robo Drug Bust scene, ""Hob"" (Gabriel Damon) who taunts Robo, played opposite Michael Dorn in ""The Bonding"". Mark Rolston who was also in 'Aliens"", was in ""Eye of the Beholder"" and also one episode of Star Trek Continues. Stephen Lee ""Duffy"" was the target of an Alien Assasin in ""The Vengeance Factor"". Jeff McCarthy was ""Roga Danar"", a supersoldier who Troi befriends. Maybe there are more TNG Alumni. Most likely, these are the actors Central Casting used back in 1990 when this was made, and we can virtually date when a film of series was made simply by the guest stars and extras.Tom Noonan, from ""Manhunter"", is ""Cain"", a guy who makes Dope that makes Dope look like a weenie roast, and he's nasty. Noonan always plays great crooks, and he eventually becomes something worse for the final act of this film. But what boggles me is that as sequels go, this isn't that bad, although not quite as good as the original. From the start is has some of the same elements that made RoboCop great. But you never know what's going to be a hit or not. This film has much of the look and feel of RoboCop, but for some reason it didn't go over. Of course there are plenty of problems and weak spots, but it is interesting to watch this in relation to the Original RoboCop and the reboot RoboCop from 2014.Again, most of this was practical effects, but in 1990 some primitive CGI was used here. If you don't get caught up in the problems with this film, it does become part of the 3-film Robo story, concluded in Robo 3 with a different actor than Weller.",RoboCop 2
46,jimbo-53-186511,"Shows promise early on and it is occasionally entertaining & amusing, but it lacks the heart of the original and is also much more stupid",4,26 June 2015,"*********************SPOILERS THROUGHOUT**************************I've always been a fan of the original Robocop film and have seen it several times. To me it's a film that is a nice blend of social commentary, satire, intelligence, action, entertainment & heart. I hadn't seen the sequel for some time and after watching it this evening I can only say that it was partly successful...Robocop 2 starts out in a similar vein to the first film with police officers on strike. As a result of the police being on strike, Detroit City has made a descent into lawlessness; at the start it shows individuals pillaging from each other and looting shops and convenience stores. I also liked the fact that at the start we see Robocop trying to make a connection to his past life... this for me was a big strength in the first film and is a very emotive part of the story. Sadly it isn't given much focus here which is a shame as it is a strong and interesting aspect of the Robocop story.What really lets this film down is the story and the simple truth of the matter is that it just isn't as strong as the story in the first film; everyone is addicted to drugs? Is that all we get here? It's perhaps not necessarily the concept that's bad, but the way it's executed here with the writers not really offering much commentary on the subject. I would have forgiven this aspect of the plot more if it had been remotely interesting, but I just found it really hard to get involved with this story.There also seemed to be pointless deviations such as Robocop's glitch where OCP 're-programme' him. I'll admit that this aspect of the story was quite amusing and entertaining, but it was rather pointless and went nowhere. If the point was to show OCP as being incompetent or misguided then this was unnecessary as this was already ascertained in the first film. I just didn't see the point.There is also a scene later in the film where Robocop discovers the kid who was one of Cain's gang dying in the back of a van; he then gives some heart felt speech and asks Robocop not to leave him.... give me a break. Were we supposed to feel sorry for the kid? Was that supposed to be a tender moment? He was almost as bad as Cain himself and was deserved of no sympathy whatsoever.I also loved the fact that OCP intended to send Robocop 2 out to clean the streets of Nuke even though he is addicted to Nuke himself; isn't that a bit like asking a prolific drug dealer to go out and clean the streets of drugs himself?I think one of the worst aspects of this film was the decision to turn Cain into OCP's Robocop 2; if I'm being cynical I just saw that as a plot device to set up the inevitable showdown between Robocop 2 and Robocop.To me this film is sloppy, but it's sloppy in too many areas to make it forgivable. It does provide entertainment value and is quite amusing and I still love Robocop's 'Thank you for not smoking' line. However, it's far too stupid to be really classed as a good film or even to be considered a worthy sequel.",RoboCop 2
47,lukem-52760,A THRILLING UNDERRATED SEQUEL,8,27 October 2019,"The ultra-violent & extremely dark ""Robocop 2"" is another one of those excellent sequels to a Classic that seem to get ignored or hated on!!!Robocop 2 i put on the same list of great 2nd sequels that are just as good as their original first films, we have a list here of extremely underrated but fantastic Sequels: Gremlins 2,Predator 2,Ghostbusters 2,Poltergeist 2,Die Hard 2,Lethal weapon 2,Halloween 2,Jaws 2,Aliens,Batman Returns,Child's play 2,Candyman 2: Farewell to the Flesh, Hellboy 2: The Golden Army, Blade 2,Death Wish 2, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, Mad Max 2,Ghoulies 2,Saw 2,The Empire Strikes Back,Beverly Hills Cop 2,Guyver: Dark Hero,TMNT 2: Secret of the ooze,TMNT: Out of the Shadows, Equalizer 2, Taken 2, Spiderman 2 (Tobey Maguire), Guardians of the Galaxy volume 2, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Maze Runner: The Scortch Trials, Another 48hrs, Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps, Men In Black 2 & probably alot more!!!
THESE some others but these films stand out as fantastic films & i actually like some of these Sequels better than their originals, such as i much prefer ""Die Hard 2"" over the first & i much prefer Ghostbusters 2 over it's Classic original, i also prefer the fun craziness of Gremlins 2 over the first & Predator 2 is actually better than the ""Schwarzenegger"" CLASSIC, also Child's play 2 is better than it's first film, again this is in my opinion!!!
see i grew up watching all these films & often have preferred the sequel over the ""Classic"" original!!!
Anyway back to the violent crime riddled Robocop 2, this excellent sequel is in many ways even more darker,Dangerous & more brutal that the '87 Classic!!!
Robocop 2 should definitely be a Cult film, a true Cult Classic in my opinion,
I always remember the ""Nuke"" drug that they inject into their necks lol it has such memorable bits like that, it always stayed with me like watching this on old vhs on a Saturday night & the luminous gang graffiti covered walls of the crime infested dark streets of Futuristic Detroit, i have as much Nostalgia for this sequel as i do the first film.
Robocop 2 is an action packed sci-fi Thriller that has some amazing Cyborg fight scenes & blasts of brutal violence & Robocop himself seems in a much Darker place & paul Weller still gives his solid serious performance as he did in the first film but here he's much more a tortured & sad soul thid time around, some of the stuff that the ""Nuke"" gang do to him is really brutal & disturbing to watch, like the the scene where they capture Robocop & literally strip him down & tear him apart with different tools & even a jackhammer!!! It's a really dark moment in a very dark film, the whole film is extremely violent & gritty as hell.
The look & cinematography is much better here than the first film, Robocop 2 has a slick pure 90s look & at the exciting start where we see how bad Detroit has gotten with crime & homelessness all over the night time streets & luminous gang graffiti over the walls, then Hookers & street thugs causing trouble & as the camera follows all this chaos along the street there's an Awesome musical score & the whole scene feels very exciting & a real Comic book feel almost like a scene from ""Tim Burton's"" Batman, Robocop 2 is greatly directed & photographed.
The fx & stop motion animation is fantastic, the look of the evil Cyborg ""Cain"" is Awesome & scary, there's a real darker viciousness to this movie it's much more Grittier & more disturbing especially with the Cyborg experiments that go wrong scene!!!""CAIN"" is a very scary,sinister & evil drug lord villain played by Tom Noonan who is excellent at playing scary bad guys!!! He's a fantastic movie villain who literally turns into a monster.
The villains gang are psycho druggies who are savages & the little evil boy who becomes a drug lord is hilarious as well as tragic.
As a sequel ""Robocop 2"" is excellent, it ups the grime & Crime & the violence is raw & brutal & the mood is dark & full of doom!!!
""Robocop 2"" is actually my favourite of the Robocop films!!! I have more Nostalgia for this sequel than even the Classic first film.
This is a more than a solid SCI-FI THRILLER, it's an action Cult Classic to me & it's paced well & looks fantastic.
This is also Action packed & full of terrific memorable moments & it came out at a time in my childhood i remember fondly & have huge Nostalgia love for a few CLASSIC films that came out in 1990!!!
Robocop 2 is also one of my favourite movies of all time (In my top 10) & the other greats i grew up with from the beautiful year for films ""1990"" were ""Arachnophobia"" & ""Child's play 2"" & ""Predator 2"" & ""Kindergarten Cop"" & ""Total Recall"" & ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" & ""Die Hard 2"" & ""Tremors"" & ""Marked For Death""
""Dick Tracey"" & ""Gremlins 2"" & ""Home Alone"" & ""Another 48hrs"" you get the picture that that wonderful year of 1990 was great for movies & these movies i grew up watching & loving on video.A sequel that is nearly as good as the first film, if not better in some ways just like Ghostbusters 2,Predator 2,Die Hard 2,Gremlins 2 & Child's play 2.",RoboCop 2
48,rooprect,"lol Robocop's new themesong has a choir singing ""ROBO!! COP!!!""",6,22 March 2021,"I kid you not. If you want a hearty laugh, stick around as the end credits roll and listen to the full Robocop themesong which has about 2.5 minutes of people singing ROBO-COPPPPP!!! Fine, you say, maybe this is a tongue-in-cheek satire like the 60s Batman tv show? Not quite. This flick takes itself pretty seriously, which is where it fails.Aside from some awesome campy tv news and commercial cutaways, exactly as in the original, this installment of Robocop lacks the cheeky wit and dark humor of its predecessor. Also gone are the characteristic, personable (lovable?) villains and the deep sociopolitical skewering that made the first Robo a timeless classic. Instead here we get a straightforward plot based bang-em-up showcase which can be entertaining in its own right, but it's not a true Robocop experience. The most noticeable failure is that the bad guys are entirely cardboard: a mysterious but never fleshed out messiah character, a little kid who is wonderfully cold-hearted at first but his character turns sappy, and a ditzy tagalong who is a groan worthy stereotype of the 80s token female sidekick, right down to the hysterical crying (yes I'm describing one of the villains).Peter Weller does a great job within his limitations, but here the script really kneecapped him. It gave Weller a few promising themes of emotional conflict but barely a taste before moving on, never a good central theme for Weller and the audience to grasp. A dozen appetizers but no main course. Similarly, the story itself is a pastiche of episodic subplots which introduce themselves and are quickly resolved before moving on to the next. For example, the intriguing subplot of Robo stalking his widow is introduced at the outset but hastily resolved and never revisited. 5 minutes, move on. The excellent subplot of Robo being reprogrammed--literally his personality changed--by the corporate suits is really powerful but also hastily resolved and never touched again. 5 minutes, move on. The result is a sort of Readers Digest version of a complete film, with good bits to whet our appetite but without giving us a full course. Watch it if you just want to see a vanilla 80s action flick, but that's all it really offers.In closing... *sings* ROBO--COPPP!! ROBOOOO--COPPPP!!!! ROOOOBOOOO--aw stuff a sock innit already.",RoboCop 2
49,gcd70,Change of style is not a disappointment,6,12 October 2007,"A change in director has meant a change in style for this ""Robocop"" movie. This sequel is graphic and action-packed, as was the first, but our director has swapped the violent, harsh style of Verhoeven for a technological look which he previously implemented in ""The Empire Strikes Back"".""Robocop"" faces this time a drug lord named 'Cain' who is trying to spread the ultra addictive 'Nuke' all around the decaying city of Detroit. Peter Weller reprises his original role as does Nancy Allen and many other original cast members in a movie which is very much a special effects show, and an impressive one at that. Not as good, or quite as funny (almost though) as the first, but fans shouldn't be disappointed.Saturday, September 19, 1992 - Video",RoboCop 2
50,guisreis,Politicizing the debate: why 'Robocop II' is better than 'Robocop',7,21 May 2014,"It is not bad as many critics say, for sure. Indeed, it is very similar to the first film of the franchise and because of some issues that it discusses I considered it even better (what I know very few people do).On the one hand, it was not as original as the previous movie (which uses to be overrated), but on the other hand it perhaps brings the discussion of very serious political problems: what happens when public interest is not the priority and private profit is, what happens when public services are guided by profit goals. Then we see the decay of democracy, imminent residents removal, the failure of the ""war on drugs"" strategy to deal with the drugs problem...Though, the film does have many flaws, such as the awful actors for the smaller roles and extras, besides some ridiculous scenes, such as the one in which teenagers throw popcorns on Robocop or the one in which children rob a store wearing baseball uniforms.",RoboCop 2
51,Samiam3,"Almost a good sequel, but not quite",6,25 July 2009,"Though not a terrible sequel, Robocop 2 has a little too much instability to be called solid entertainment. Paul Verhoeven is not behind this one. In the director's chair is Irvin Kershner, who with George Lucas delivered what many consider the finest sci-fi. Of course I'm talking about The Empire Strikes Back. In the writer's chair is Frank Miller! but don't let that fool you. As good as Sin City may be, that was fifteen years after this. It looks like he was only starting to get his bearings as a screenwriter with Robocop 2, and there is a lesson to be learned here. Robocop was a good introduction to the setting and characters, now let's see some action take off from it. This is something that T2 did right, but up until the final half hour, Robocop 2 fails at this task.When the movie starts, the Detroit police are on strike, and the city is coming apart. The OCP corporation (which built robocop) wants to use this chaos to their advantage. With no law and order, they can gain control of Detroit. It's up to Robocop to save the day, but OCP has a new trick up its sleeve, the ironic Robocop 2, a machine of supreme power and strength. Is officer Murphy about to meet his mechanical match?The problem with Robocop 2 to comes down to the writing. A large portion of the film acts merely as a slow set up for the rousing climax. There is too much unnecessary story material which at first seems important but ultimately means nothing. Once again, the ending is highly abrupt. In fact, with the possible exception of Spy Hard it is the quickest I think I've ever seen. Perhaps it's just another case of biting off more than it can chew, but Robocop 2 could've been better. It is worth watching if you enjoyed the first, but it is a huge overstatement to call this a worthy sequel.",RoboCop 2
52,davidmvining,At least they tried something different,5,8 November 2021,"This movie is a mess. It's often entertaining in small stretches, but it's definitely a mess. That has a whole lot to do with the torrid history of the screenplay, going through so many drafts across so many writers, eventually settling on a rewrite of a script by comic writer Frank Miller that director Irvin Kirshner was reportedly tearing pages out of as unusable on a daily basis on set. It begins to take some ideas in new directions, but ultimately settles in for a mindless ending that can't really address any concepts that came before. It's a mixed bag and a mess, but there are also real flashes of quality here and there.The only real problem I had with the first RoboCop film was that the two storylines of the criminal and the corporation didn't come together as elegantly as they could have, making the integration feel odder than it needed to be. Well, RoboCop 2, in its finished form, looks at that problem and says, ""Let's make this a whole lot worse."" This is really two films squished into one, eventually forced together against one story's will. The first, the one that dominates the film's first half, is the titular cop (Peter Weller) chasing down the drug lord Cain (Tom Noonan). This is generic drug busting stuff, and it's where the film works least. Cain is not that interesting of a character. He's got a messianic complex about himself and his drug called Nuke, but that's kind of it. As a follow up from Clarence Boddicker, it's disappointing at least. Along with Cain's men is a child, Hob (Gabriel Damon), who seems to be there to help create a connection with RoboCop and his memory of his own son, but little to nothing is really made of it. It's interesting to see a 12 year old boy actually carry scenes with some level of menace, so I have to give the kid and Kirshner props for pulling that off.The other major story is OCP trying to replicate the success of RoboCop, and this is the movie at its best. Everything about OCP in the first hour or so is gold. The Old Man (Dan O'Herlihy) brings on the young psychologist Dr. Juliette Faxx (Belinda Bauer) to help with the cybernetics team to figure out what's going on with their new models, all of whom end up going crazy and commit suicide on tape. The Old Man tiredly placing his head in his hand as he watches the failures, repeating the sum of money wasted on the process, is the same kind of corporate satire that made the first film so fun.RoboCop eventually chases down Cain to a remote industrial site (repeating similar imagery from the first film for good or ill) where Cain and his men get the better or RoboCop and take him apart. This sequence is oddly cut together, moving surprisingly slowly with little effort to get the audience involved in the slow dismantling and torture of our hero. Again, pretty much everything with Cain is not really very good.Dismantled and thrown to the ground in front of some striking police officers (a subplot that doesn't really go much of anyplace), RoboCop gets rebuilt with OCP deciding to update his programming, lead by Dr. Faxx. This stuff, where OCP gives him hundreds of new directives like, ""Do not use harsh language"" is borderline hilarious. The scene where RoboCop goes out into the field and tries to read Miranda Rights to a corpse is strong stuff. And then...RoboCop instantly fixes himself by grabbing some power cables and that interesting idea is over now. Never mind it. It'll never matter again.And then, RoboCop kind of disappears for a while. The underlying plot of the film is about OCP buying up Detroit's debt, forcing it into foreclosure, and then buying up the city's properties when it misses a payment (complete with not very subtle flags making OCP out to be equivalent to Nazis). The fascist element never really connects on a satirical or dramatic level (Detroit hasn't exactly been a good city in the real world which undermines the idea that a corporation is evil for thinking that they could do a better job of running it than the decades of failure that civilian government produced and the movies never made any attempt to portray any other way). It doesn't help that the elected mayor (Willard E. Pugh) is baby-faced and obviously in way over his head, implying that he was probably an awful mayor, and he's willing to get into bed with anyone offering to paper over his financial problems, including Hob by the end.Cain eventually gets captured, and Dr. Faxx decides, for reasons, that the best candidate for a new RoboCop is a psychopath addicted to drugs. It's not the movie's best decision. This new RoboCop attacks the meeting between Hob and the mayor, and RoboCop finds his way to the site after the Cain has left, getting a weird moment with the dying Hob that's supposed to mean something. What that something actually is, I have no idea.Then the final act is noise as RoboCop and Cain fight up and down a tower. It doesn't matter. There are no real stakes, and nothing has any emotional weight. Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) comes from the first movie with virtually nothing to do through the bulk of the film, and we get some kind of ironic stopping point that feels like it belongs at the end of a Billy Wilder comedy.Yeah, it's a mess. I don't hate it by any means, but I'm alternatively laughing and just outright bored as the movie progresses. There are flashes of the first movie's satirical genius, but they get overwhelmed by an uninteresting drug story, ideas that go nowhere, and an action ending that's nothing more than just loud things.",RoboCop 2
53,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,The blood is still there but there's no continuity,6,7 June 2012,"Sequels always run the risk of falling short of their predecessors and it happens for various reasons. Most fail from the lack of originality in the plot or the characters from the first film are left out. However, this sequel has both these factors and nothings wrong with it. The issue lies within the plot with these little things called ""sub- plots"". What's wrong with them? The fact that they deliberately take a step backwards and that was the wrong idea for this franchise in general. Not to mention, there were parts where some problems are never resolved. I explained this in my review of Raise the Titanic (1980) as well.Peter Weller is back as the cyborg cop who helped take down a ruthless drug dealer, Clarence Boddicker. A year has past now and RoboCop, who now calls himself Murphy, his former self, has done a lot of good for the city of Detroit. And somehow, the only people that recognize this is everyone hired by the police department. Practically every scene depicted here is either an individual restricting RoboCop, cursing at him or vandalizing him. If he's done so much good, why does everyone disrespect him? There's nothing admirable about that.A sub-plot that is minimally explored is the relationship between RoboCop and Alex Murphy's wife. Since the first film, RoboCop now understands who he was and by remembering his old memories, would like to gain back what he had before he became Detroit's finest. But again, we are given the issue of people restricting him. We are briefly introduced to this character called Holzgang who forces the idea onto RoboCop that he is property and that's all he is. That's right, it's society vs RoboCop! After the ""meeting"" (more like roast), RoboCop is confronted by his wife and forces the opinion on her that her husband is dead. What is this telephone? And that's how that situation is resolved. Not very productive if you ask me.The director of RoboCop 2 is Irvin Kershner and that surprised me, since he was the sequel director for Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980). How he let this film become off base with the first is baffling. There's another part in the film where Murphy is being programmed with a bunch bogus directives that make him absolutely what he shouldn't be as a police officer, and the results are shown that all that programming was to of no use to him or society anyway. Just another sub-plot that doesn't have any value to it. Why bother with all this U- turn screenplay Frank Miller? And the worst is at the end! There's nothing more abrupt than the ending of this film and it's truly shocking.They only points I can give this film are for a few things. This movie is still rated R and that pleased me. The universe that he lives in is no walk in the park. Violence is everywhere and it's his job to rid of it. The villain, Cain, acted by Tom Noonan is fairly sinister too. He's no Clarence Boddicker, but he's just as demented if not more. The special effects are principal here as well. By the 90s, stop motion animation was about over and this was probably the last film to use it, but it still looks cool, especially for the Cain cyborg. The other area that I thought added a little more to the story was how this film shows the gradual corruption of the company, OCP. At the end of the first film, one could think that order was restored,...well apparently not.Besides these key things, nothing else was appealing. Even the musical soundtrack, produced by Leonard Rosenman, brings very little to the table. The tune is repetitive and it doesn't even hint a sci-fi tone nor replay Poledouris' theme from the first movie. Another thing that was disturbing was how the film involved children of different ages to swear like they were at a foul mouth convention. I understand that its supposed to show how bad things are in Detroit, but audiences get the point just by watching foul mouthed grown ups; not children! Besides, I wonder how those children feel now that they're all grown up? Do you feel proud of yourselves? I sure wouldn't.It retains some parts from the first film but it utterly fails to finish anything that it throws out. RoboCop 2 is a jumbled mess of ideas that never sinks its teeth into a definite target.",RoboCop 2
54,Sandcooler,"Less satire, more mayhem",8,10 May 2014,"While the original ""Robocop"" was really just a satire on consumerism disguised as a mainstream action movie, this one doesn't do disguises. It just goes for that high body count, and occasionally for blatant padding with some comic relief. But it kept the dark cynical tone of the original, it kept the nonsensical violence and it kept Peter Weller (take notes, ""Robocop 3""), so I don't have that much to complain about. The only problem I really have with it is that it's a really clichéd action movie, bordering parody, but then when we get to the end you have no satisfaction whatsoever. Director Irvin Kershner refuses to give you that typical 80s climax you can all cheer about and just keeps things bleak and downbeat all the way through. In a way it's a good choice because at least it makes the movie unpredictable, but then again: do we want these movies to be unpredictable? Don't we just watch something like ""Robocop 2"" to see exactly what we expect? I'll get back to you on that, but I'm not saying this is a bad movie. On the contrary, it's highly entertaining and at times some of the brilliance of the original shines through. Worthy sequel.",RoboCop 2
55,DJAkin,Goofy as it gets!,4,13 February 2002,"I knew this would be a bad movie when I saw the title.  The first movie was great.  Ronnie Cox played a good evil man and Peter Weller delivered the goods.  In this horrible sequal, there is some kid who looks like that kid from Malcom In The Middle who is very evil.  He is mean to Robocop and at one point SHOOTS HIM IN THE EYE.  There is a man who is called Cade.  He is a sorry excuse for a villian.  He is the one who tries to torture this one cop by gutting him.  Robocop becomes super silly at one point when he is reprogrammed.  He starts acting all polite and even lets some kids spray paint ""kick me"" on the back.  Then Robocop decides to ELECTROCUTE himself to get rid of this silly habbit of acting like a sissy.

56,punishmentpark,Surprisingly nice sequel!,7,20 January 2016,"After my initial disappointment that Anne (Nancy Allen) didn't become Robobabe straight away, since she was so severely shot up at the end of part one, I decided to hope for that to happen later on (no, it didn't) and move on. So, then, 'Robocop 2' seemed to become a lesser version of its predecessor; less impressive villains, less impressive action and a lot of bad one-liners from Robocop himself (not that part one had such great one-liners - not at all, really).But things stayed interesting here and there, and Tom Noonan was a pretty good choice as the new main baddie. And then came more and more terrific ideas: about the cops taking over the city with a cunning financial plan, about a kid who thinks he is the next Scarface, about Robocop (the original) descending into an identity crisis by an overload of rules, about a load of baseball kids (led by their coach!) looting a store, about Dr. Faxx exacting a devious plan to use villains for cops and keeping them in control through drugs, about a fresh young black mayor who decides to get his money from anyone just to stay in power... etc., etc. (it gets a little too obvious in the end with the Nazi flag and the Gestapo outfits, though, ha ha). Yes, 'Robocop 2' has a lot to offer, if you'll keep in mind that it's a sort of exploitation flick with a big budget (looks like it - I haven't checked) - and a very creative one.The creative cherry on top here is the loads of stop-motion scenes with Robocop 1 fighting Robocop 2, which actually don't come in until a lot later. There's some short bits of other Robocop stop-motion bits earlier on, which are good fun as well.It's hard to decide if this one is better or just as good as the first one, but both get a big 7 out of 10 for now.",RoboCop 2
57,oneguyrambling,If the hero is an assembly line robot it makes sense that the films should look alike.,5,27 December 2011,"The first 10 minutes set out to prove that this right here is no cheapie cash-in of a sequel. The two hours that follow have Murph-O-Cop protecting innocent citizens by blowing away various bad guys, recalling his wife and kid while dastardly high ups in the police force seek to erase such memories.It isn't terrible, but it is so similar that if you took the numbers off the DVD boxes and discs you might be hard-pressed to pick one from the other.In the same 'kill or be killed' lawless society that is urban Detroit the privately run Police force look to cut corners and this time actually promote anarchy so they can divide up city assets and sell them.Once again it seems there are precious few good cops – the bulk are on strike again – Robocop is obviously one, the last bastion of hope, decency, law and order. The other is Lewis (Nancy Allen), who if you think about it rationally was Murphy's partner for exactly one shift before he became a potato, so trying to remind us of the solid bond they once shared is a little bit rich.Anyway Roby gets toasted again by the bad guy of the day in this dystopian future – this film's name is Cain – and his 'Nuke' cult of criminals complete with a well presented but essentially evil young teen in tow calling many of the shots.Roby once again gets an end-of-film nemesis, this time a primitive 90s CGI created one fuelled by the very drug Robocop is out to save the city from.Look they tried pretty hard, this really was all you could when in reality the first film wasn't much chop to begin with. But I think this scene sums up the attention to detail: Robocop drives to a gate, he exits the car to open the gate and the camera pans to show that he is being watched through the eyes of many crouching bad guys. The car moves forward and BOOM! Explodes in a fiery ball of death. The criminals advance cautiously only to have Robocop emerge and start blazing away Re-read that if it sounds fine to you. Did every criminal's eyes follow along when the camera panned??? Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. More 'dark news', zany cynical ads and the usual splatter filled body count largely created by one of the most ineffective so-called 'super' crime fighters in cinema.",RoboCop 2

This was an action-packed movie. It was a futuristic look at the drug crisis that we face today. Nowadays, it was actually happening. Now imagine a dead cop re-incarnated as a mechanical fighter of justice, how cool would that be. Would it happen? Only time will tell. Now back to the movie. ""Robocop 2"" is not a bad film, although it is inferior to its successful predecessor ""Robocop"". This one was more violent, under the courtesy of writer Frank Miller, coping for a plot involving a money-hungry goon named Cain (Tom Noonan) who introduces Detroit with the drug called Nuke, a drug which poisons your nerves. Cain's translation: It relaxes you. Of course, Robocop is back, but the other cops couldn't do anything for they're on strike.Despite the plot, the pre- CGI special-effects are also great, considering stop-motion. The film makes up for some weak character elements with lots of exciting moments. And it manages to pull things off.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",RoboCop 2

Also Robocop is taken apart and programmed with absurd commands for awhile as well as facing the dilemma whether he's human or not. Right here describes the problem the film is too ambitious for its own good. There are so many plot threads (that are sloppily resolved or just abandoned!) that it's impossible to conclude the movie with a satisfying ending. However that being said this does work as an action flick and really there are some interesting angles and the film is littered with effective black comedy, the film is also well paced with some excellent special effects.

61,one9eighty,Thank you for not smoking,7,25 August 2020,"Following on from the first Robocop film, Detroit is still a mess despite the introduction of the robotic law enforcer. The city is in that bad a state, that Mayor Kuzak is fearful that OCP might just buy the city out like they could do to other corporations. The Detroit police department are still on strike due to OCP cutting salaries and benefits. A new designer drug is flooding the streets of Detroit thanks to crime lord/ drug baron, Cain. Cain seems to be one step ahead of the police, until Robocop and Officer Lewis stumble on a dirty cop giving out information. After interrogating him, Robocop is able to infiltrate the factory where Cain is hiding out. Unfortunately, Cain is ready of Robocop and captures him. He orders his gang to take Robocop apart, and then they dump the parts outside of Detroit Police HQ next to the cops that are on the picket line. OCP decides to fix Robocop, but also to try and make him more appealing by giving him new programming. Once deployed back into action it is apparent that the new programming is causing problems, Robocop's pit crew can't fix him directly, but overhearing a potential fix Robocop takes matters into his own hands and electrocutes himself - thus ridding him of the new programming. He then leads a major assault on Cain's hideout which culminates in Cain being hospitalised but brought to justice all the same. One of Cain's crew, the child called Hob, takes control of business. One of OCP's specialists, Faxx mentioned in a previous meeting that she had been working ona replacement to the Robocop initiative, and with Cain at death's door this is the perfect opportunity for her to integrate his brain into a robot for a new Robocop mark 2 kind of venture. Where cop brains have been used previously without success (Murphy seems to be a one-off success), perhaps a criminal brain might work. Once created, Faxx sets Cain-bot to work, his first task is to exterminate Mayor Kuzak, in exchange for the Nuke drug of course, because that is what Robo-Cain craves despite being a brain in a robot shell. After the assassination attempt on Kuzak, OCP has a meeting to announce Delta City, a renewed Detroit - OCP's long term goal which was discussed in the first film. The plan will be to use Robocop 2, a.k.a. Cain-bot to rid the city of crime, and then work can fully commence on Delta City. Robocop turns up knowing that Cain is Robocop 2. This sends Cain-bot into a frenzy and a massive fight ensues between the two robo's - who will survive?!This film sees Irvin Kershner take the directorial chair, who famously also directed ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) and ""Never Say Never Again"" (1983). Peter Weller returns as Robocop, with Nancy Allen once again wearing the police uniform as his partner, as Officer Ann Lewis. Dan O'Herlihy is ""Old Man"" again, with Tom Noonan as Cain, and Gabriel Damon as Hob.
I enjoyed ""Robocop 2"", probably as much as the first ""Robocop"" movie, but regardless of what I think, this movie came in for a bit of hate in its day. It was regarded as inferior to the first film and more cartoonish. Something I cannot understand because all the elements that made the first film are all there. Verhoeven may have stepped away from the franchise, but in Kershner, the film still has a risk taker in charge. Take for example the role that Gabriel Damon has with the Hob character. Having a young teenage boy as emotionless criminal element was a massive risk, but the character is memorable, and in fact, he stands out in all his scenes. There is development with this character too; from displaying naivety, to full on psycho, to fearful and almost repentant at his end. Some people slated the use of a child for a criminal mastermind role; the way he swears all the time and kills without remorse. But, he is a victim of circumstance in a dystopian future that has a lot of violence; he is a product of the surroundings he is in - as such I have no problem at all with this characters inclusion in the story.This sequel had a bigger budget than the first film, this time having $25-30 million (opposed to $13 million). Taking nearly $50 million in the box office it nearly equalled the take from the first film. Slightly longer at 117 minutes, that additional time and budget was spent on some epic action sequences - especially at the end of the film. This may look a little dated no in the CGI heavy industry that Hollywood has become, but in 1990 this was fresh and modern. Stop motion animation with puppetry is something I don't easily get tired of, it might look dated by today's lofty standards but I see it as a part of the evolution of effects and wouldn't let that interrupt my viewing pleasure of the film.One of the complaints about the film was that the humanity was taken away from Robocop, the human aspect of him was not explored. This is difficult to accept because he is supposed to be a robot with a tiny bit of humanity left with whatever flesh he has remaining. To focus on a humanised story just seems wrong. There were plenty of emotions for the audience to emphasise with; seeing Robocop in pain as his cruelly dismantled, seeing him messed up due to the way OCP have rebuilt him, watching him look for clarity through the self-imposed shock therapy.I enjoyed this film a lot. It is not one to watch with young children, and your mum probably will not want to watch this either. It is rated 18 for a reason, there is lots of violence, drugs, sexual reference, adult themes, bloodshed, and gore. If you enjoyed the first ""Robocop"" film then there is no reason why you will not enjoy this one. If you have not seen the first film, don't worry, this is something that you can pick up with no need to fully know the back story. The cast are brilliant, the action is spot on, it's an emotive journey with development for the characters - 7 out of 10.",RoboCop 2
62,Mister-6,"""RoboCop""-out...",1,6 February 2000,"It's a shame that they didn't trust the original enough to build on it. 
But ""RoboCop 2"" takes the great ideas, imagination and characters of the original and replaces them with all the stereotypes that sequels have to offer.The beginning commercial was cute and so was the scene that follows (reminiscent of the beginning in ""Guys and Dolls""!)  but aside from a flash of thought here and there, this is one film that is a slow, dirty slog down into the middle of nowhere.Ideas are introduced then dropped, interesting characters from the original hardly get any screen time here, most of the new characters (Cain, Juliette Faxx) are so boring that they wouldn't hold up no matter what the movie, and then there's the tone.In the Blessed Original, Paul Verhoeven knew how to direct with the kind of attitude where if you cranked up the attitude and the sensibility of a good pulp comic, even the most repellent violence would be entertaining. Kershner (although he DID direct a ""Star Wars"" sequel) doesn't.  And scene after scene either makes you cringe, look away or just tune it out altogether.And what's with RoboCop??  HE should be the main thing here, right?  But there's whole scenes where he doesn't even show up, and what scenes he is in are so half-thought and shakily written that you don't know or care if he's part-human or part-cyborg - since he's all-boring.Never have I seen such a rapid fall from grace.  Why does Hollywood make such bad sequels?  On purpose?  Why; did the film-makers have a bet going?Only one star for ""RoboCop 2""; the FX are good but the story doesn't even try to match them.",RoboCop 2

That's right - Cain.Don't hold your breath waiting for the perennial bitch Belinda Bauer to get her punishment - she never does, one of the things working against the film is pushing the buttons that make you mad and then not pushing the ones that make you feel good. The closest we come to Belinda getting throttled is when she gets humiliated when her Robo 2 goes haywire and when she looks mad at Robo 1 defeating Robo 2.When the murderous boy Hob is killed we're expected to feel sympathetic towards him as he reaches out to Robo - even though the boy hasn't shown any signs of humanity and helped torment and tear apart Robo earlier. In short, Hob should have been left on the cutting room floor.Great spectacle and great music by Leonard Rosenman help, along with some occasionally amusing social commentary.

66,ivo-cobra8,Underrated sci-fi action flick - Defending an Underrated Sequel,8,12 April 2017,"Why does this film get's so much hate? Why do I keep hearing that Robocop 3 is better than this, that Robocop (2014) remake is better than this. I don't understand that and I never will. I mean is this good as the first film? no of course not, is it worthy sequel? yes it is! This is an entertaining action film yes. It R rated blast it is yes. I do wish that this movie would come out over the summer I do really miss this kind of action films. Robocop 3 and Robocop remake are not and will never be better than this sequel. I grew up watching this movie it defines my childhood. This was really my first film of the trilogy before I even watched the original. I was entertained in here we have RoboCop VS RoboCain monstrous robot who is addicted to drugs, has mass a machine guns annihilation people blowing up cop cars, killing cops, van's, ambulances. Killing news people, this big battle between Robocop and RoboCain fantastic.RoboCop 2 (1990) is rated R! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR not PG-13 It Is violent, action gore adrenaline sci-fi flick not for kids. I am defending my favorite sequel that has Peter Weller and Nancy Allen in it! I don't wan't to see Robert John Burke or even Joel Kinnaman who suck dicks in the whole movies! I love this movie to death the end is the best at all. In this movie RoboCop jumps on a back of a monsters addicted robot, rips his brain out, smashes in to the ground to the pulp. Plot: RoboCop 2 is the 1990 sequel to RoboCop. Peter Weller returns as the cybernetic law enforcement officer, who now battles an even more sadistic gang led by a deranged killer known as Cain (Tom Noonan), while mega-corporation Omni Consumer Products prepares to take private ownership of Detroit and unveil a new, more powerful law enforcement unit. This is a prototypical ""good"" action movie -- intense, perfectly executed, original action, shown to the tune of a forgettable and occasionally insulting story.I am giving an 8/10 -- an outstanding score. And the gunplay is delivered in perfect Miller style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is bloody you can see how the gang cut's Robocop to pieces and it is bloody. There was a kid Hob in the film and no he wasn't annoying, he did a good job playing the bad guy. Not annoying kid and I think he did a good job. Robocop shot a guy in the eye. Nancy Allen as Lewis has much to do like she drives an armored SWAT van the one they used in Die Hard and smashes in to RoboCain, she shots three bad guys, she kicks ass. RoboCop saves a baby.I don't mind the music score everyone complains about Leonard Rosenman and his music score. I know they should use Basil Poledouris music score but they used different music score and I never mind it, I thought it was an okay song. The film was directed by Irvin Kershner (The Empire Strikes Back and Never Say Never Again) from a story written by noted graphic novelist Frank Miller. Irvin Kershner did an excellent job directing this sequel I know that Paul Verhoeven suppose to direct this movie but he never direct sequels before and he wasn't sure if he should do it, Hollywood needed a sequel so Irvin Kershner went to directing it. This is his last movie and it is really a shame he is no longer with us anymore R.I.P. Irvin Kershner.They don't make movies like this one today! I wish I would had sci-fi action movies like are this one today!! I really wish! This is a solid damn sequel that has an action scenes while RoboCock (2014) has no action scenes they can't effort it, it is a PG-13 rated family film. I have this movie on Blu-ray screw Robocop 3 and the remake I will watch this movie. I love action movies this is an action movie that's how they do it right! Is Tom Noonan better bad guy than Kurtwood Smith no. But he does an excellent job as the evil bad guy and he is a cult leader.I know Peter Weller and Nancy Allen were disappointed with how the movie come out and they don't care for this movie. But honestly it was a pretty damn good entertainment, I wasn't bored with it. I would be proud on this movie. Rambo III (1988), Missing in Action (1984), Cobra (1986), Predator 2 (1990), Blade: Trinity (2004), The Matrix Revolutions (2003) are so fun underrated action films that are getting so much hate and bashed this days for it, that is horrible. I still love them all. RoboCop 2 is a 1990 American cyberpunk action film directed by Irvin Kershner. Set in the near future in a dystopian metropolitan Detroit, Michigan, it is the sequel to the 1987 film, RoboCop.It's a good continuation of RoboCop story. There is nothing new here , but it's well executed. In the end it's one of those rare satisfying sequels. They do there own stuff they don't copy the original film just like Predator 2 they do their own stuff and i love that. Sue me I love RoboCop 2! I give it 8/10 it doesn't deserve the hate!",RoboCop 2
67,The_Movie_Cat,"""In every way an improvement over the original. It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you... Robocop 2""",4,29 September 2000,"Following which, the touted update goes and shoots itself through the head. Rather apt, considering the sorry state of this movie, a sequel to a film which patently didn't need one.What really irritates about Robocop 2 is that the makers obviously didn't understand why the original was so good in the first place. Robocop (7) was a witty, vibrant satire of bad action movies. Robocop 2 is just a bad action movie.Thin on dialogue, particularly towards the tedious, shoot-out finale, it attracts little interest and possesses none of the energy or spirit of the original. The spoof ads, now a little tasteless (""Warning: continued use will cause skin cancer"") seem merely there as an afterthought. And calling a new designer drug ""Nuke"" is nowhere near as subtle or as funny as the original's family board game, ""Nuke em!""The stop-motion animation  the weakest element of the original  is used more extensively, while this humourless sequel fails to include a credits sequence, which makes it look even more cheap and hurried. Ah, humourless? You might say. But what about the funny mayor, or the way Robo is reprogrammed to spout platitudes? Yes, these are attempts at light relief, as is Robo tightening himself up with a screwdriver (""we're only human"") for the film's punchline, but none are likely to induce laughter. Like the rest of the film, they're staid and moronic attempts at entertainment.The third and final film in the series (imaginatively titled Robocop 3; 5) saw Peter Weller leave, to be replaced by Robert John Burke, who does well in a undemanding role. With toned-down language and violence, it was an obvious plea to the kiddie market, a Robo action figure much plugged throughout. With it's social conscience too overstated, and Robocop's new-found arm attachments and jetpack getting too silly, the final film was never destined to be a masterpiece. Yet fluid direction by Fred Dekker and a flowing pace make this one enjoyably throwaway viewing.Robocop, then, is the film proper. Robocop 3 is the sequel which you could watch if there was nothing better on. Which leaves the second movie hanging in the middle, an unwatchable dirge of a picture. A franchise vehicle that has nothing to say, save for the pound signs that rung up. Irvin Kershner is no Paul Verhoven, just as comic artist Frank Miller and partner Walon Green aren't the writers that Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner were. A tragic waste of a good, if limited, concept. 4/10.",RoboCop 2
68,Maziun,"Flawed , but not quite that bad sequel",4,31 December 2013,"After the success of first ""Robocop"" the studio wanted to make a sequel as fast as possible. Paul Verhoeven and original screenwriters at that time didn't had any idea how to continue the story of Robo. The studio couldn't wait and decided to hire comic-book writer Frank Miller. Miller was a big fan of the original movie and became a star in the comic books world after creating ""The Dark knight returns"" graphic novel . Instead of Verhoeven the man behind the camera this time is Irvin Kershner (""Star wars : The Empire strikes back"").Miller wrote the script for ""Robocop 2"". The producers loved Frank Miller's original version of the script, but they quickly realized it was unfilmable as written. The final screen version was heavily rewritten and bears only a superficial resemblance to Miller's story. The bits of the story appear both in ""Robocop "" and ""Robocop 3"". Screenwriter Walon Green (""The Wild bunch"") was hired and much of what appears on screen is actually his work. In 2003, Miller's screenplay was adapted into a comic book series ""Frank Miller's Robocop"". The result ? Too many ideas are fighting for screen time. Some of them are truly bad like having a kid criminal in the story ( included for cheap shock value ?) or using a brain of psycho criminal. Some things are unexplained ( why does Lewis appear and disappear randomly , where is Robocop for most of third act ). Some ideas are good ( the strike , the reunion between Murphy and his wife). The screenplay feels like a pile of unfinished ideas put together to make a film. In the end they don't really go anywhere , but in the moment they appear they are good. A more tidy structure and thought out screenplay definitely would be nice. ""Robocop 2"" lacks the heart and soul of the original. Murphy's attempt to return to his family is interesting storyline that appears in the first 20 minutes of the movie and then doesn't come back at all. This is a storyline that this movie could follow after the original movie . Unfortunately the plot forgets to concentrate on Murphy's humanity and goes for action and satire. In the end the movie is entertaining , but completely cold and sometimes too grim. Too be fair ""Robocop 2"" is also a VERY funny movie for most of the time. The commercials (Magna Volt), ""Thank you for not smoking"" , Robocop lecturing the little kids. The film is littered with effective black comedy and well paced. The stop-motion effects have dated slightly , but still look quite good. I love the design of the monster robot. The climactic battle at the end is pretty great climax. The action scenes are definitely well-staged and imaginative.Leonard Rosenman's score for ""Robocop 2"" is heroic and upbeat. It's nice score overall , but it's a shadow of Basil's Poleudoris wonderfully tragic and heroic score from part 1. Robocop's theme isn't present in the film and that's a shame – it should appear at least at ending credits.Peter Weller doesn't disappoint . He gets a chance to show his comedic talent and still give an affecting performance. Nancy Allen and the rest of old cast are also back and they are OK. Dr. Juliette Faxx Belinda Bauer gives probably the best performance of the movie as the main OCP baddie Dr. Juliette Faxx – feisty , manipulative and sexy villain. On other hand the other villains are terrible disappointment. The idea of drug kingpin Cain who has a complex of Messiah seems really fun , but Tom Noonan here is completely forgettable . He doesn't have too much screen time , no interesting dialogues and is simply lame compared to Clarence Boddicker from the first movie. There are some nice small touches here – Frank Miller plays Frank the chemist , Irvin Kersner makes a cameo as a picture of murderer in computer, the song played by the violinist is ""Born to be wild"" by Steppenwolf , the OCP flags that appear throughout the movie are essentially Nazi flags with an OCP logo instead of the swastika.""Robocop 2"" is the only good thing that came after ""Robocop"". ""Robocop 3"" was simply horrible. TV series ""Robocop"" (1994 - 1995) & the TV mini-series ""Robocop: Prime Directives"" (2000) were bad , so was the cartoons .I give it 4/10 .",RoboCop 2
69,manitobaman81,Good,7,23 August 2014,"Instead of spelling out exactly what we're supposed to be thinking at every moment, the filmmakers respect the audience's ability to deduce meaning from the mood and tone, from the light in a frame or the ambient noise of a scene. This is a story about a place most people might not be able to conceive. All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. Against this backdrop, our robotic hero must fight on. By the end, we feel that we have learned a great deal about the characters and the community that produced them.

The same main stars, Peter Weller and Nancy Allen are in the film, but it just lacks the zip of the first film. I am a big fan of Nancy's and would be predisposed to like this, but unfortunately, this one just falls flat compared with the original. It may be that the concept of Robocop is no longer a new commodity and no longer surprises me. I don't know. I think the story is as plausible as the first (which means, not very plausible) and both actors do about the same job. It's just less good. Sorry.",RoboCop 2
71,Superunknovvn,Extremely watchable,6,3 July 2008,"""RoboCop 2"" is the logical successor to the first part. It's bigger, faster and louder. Everything you've loved about the original is here, too, only supersized: the news snippets (albeit less subtle this time around), the evil robotic opponent and the violence - only this time it's more comical. Whereas the original was a dark satire this one pretty much is a deliberate parody of itself. The whole tone of the movie is much lighter. Even RoboCop himself has gotten a light blue shade on his armor as opposed to the strict gray of part 1. It all adds up to a much lighter feel, which is one of the reasons why many fans of the original unjustly dismiss this sequel.Sure, ""RoboCop 2"" is trashy and silly and some plot points and developments are just plain bad (like having a kid criminal in the story - really when has that ever been a good idea? Also, why does Lewis disappear and reappear randomly? Where is RoboCop for most of the third act?). Some of these flaws have to do with bad editing choices by the studio or so I hear. It would be nice to see a director's cut someday.Anyway, all in all for a ""RoboCop""-sequel this one is pretty close to everything a fan could wish for. The original pretty much told the whole story of RoboCop's creation and this picks up some of the questions that were left open: Murphy finally meets his wife again and he also has to deal with his inner conflict of being a machine and a man at the same time. OCP at the same time continue their corrupt business. The makers of this one did a good job exploring the rules set up by the first part, turning the sequel into an entertaining and fun 90 minutes. It didn't surprise me one bit when I just found out that Frank Miller - THE Frank Miller is responsible for the screenplay of ""RoboCop 2"" since the movie very much plays out like a comic book adaptation. Robo gets destroyed, humiliated by kids - which surprisingly doesn't kill the character as one would assume - and he gets to fight his evil brother Cain (what a great broad hint that name is). The final confrontation is really great to watch and they did a hell of a job with the F/X there.In the end, ""RoboCop 2"" doesn't hold a candle against its predecessor, but I really don't think a sequel to that movie could have been made any better. Just watch ""RoboCop 3"" if you want to see how messed up this one could have become. Or better yet: stop after part 2 and keep a good memory of this franchise.",RoboCop 2
72,Darkside-Reviewer,Review it over creep!,8,24 May 2019,While Robocop was Ultra Violent and Gritty it's sequel slows things down a bit still keeping the blood and chaos of the original but toning it down in favour of a Cyborg fight at the end which you can tell is where most of the budget went sadly but Robocop 2 is still a great movie while not as bloody and dark as the original it entertains well enough and doesn't disappoint to much in the way of action or story.Also the IMDb page credits John Glover way too much he's in the movie for 5 seconds that's all.,RoboCop 2
73,oOgiandujaOo_and_Eddy_Merckx,Helplessness,9,7 January 2012,"This was a big hit of my youth and so I decided to take a trip down memory lane and check if it still works as I have the VHS.The plot of the film is that conglomerate OCP have decided to take over weeviled futuristic Detroit, and the way they are going to do this is by foreclosing on a loan that they have made to the city, which was secured on city assets (presumably stuff like the train station, prisons, libraries and schools). It's in their interest to let the city go to pot whilst this happens so they can play white knight to the public when they privatise, and so they withdraw their warranty on RoboCop and provoke the police to strike. RoboCop meanwhile is intent on dishing out justice to Cain, the kingpin of an organisation which distributes new designer drug, Nuke, in handy plastic cassettes.Trauma and helplessness are big themes in this movie and there are two points in the movie where already physically traumatised individuals are systematically butchered/disassembled/tortured in a helpless state. In terms of general suffering whilst helpless I think you could probably raise that to five incidents, if you count three scenes when RoboCop is helpless (aides memoire: magnet, microshocks and ""I type it, you think it""), once with a store keeper plagued by kids and also Officer Duffy.The OCP ""shyster"" points out to RoboCop that he will never be able to go out dancing and fall in love again, and I think that statement lays bare his traumatic situation, which is a fundamentally hopeless one. The only solution he can find for his pain is to go out and murder criminals. This he manages to accomplish with élan and flourish. To show off at one point he steps into a shot whilst turning his head backwards, kind of like a pool player using their other hand or closing their eyes just before they take a pot. Whereas in the first movie his flourish when holstering is something that keeps alive the memory of his son, here his antics are genuinely psychotic.The movie is pitch black at times, for example when the Old Man and corporate flunkeys watch film footage of various fatal failures in the RoboCop 2 program, I was reminded of the hideous real life footage the Nazis took of their V2 rocket tests (including one where various scientists and Reich underlings are wiped out by a boomeranging missile). Another particularly pernicious element is the corruption of childhood, one of the main baddies is small boy.Dr. Juliette Faxx comes in as the main OCP baddie, a power-dressing man-eating sexual sadist. She is an alarming paranoid sexist nightmare that plays on anxieties of the era where men felt threatened by the first generation of ""emancipated"" and competitive women in the workplace. I think that the sexist nightmare of the 90s, which perhaps is still around, is of the aggressive, and yet impeccable female colleague, which actually is all about helplessness as well! As with the first movie there are newsclips hinting of the helplessness of the time, where environmental catastrophes come one straight after another, holes multiplying in the dam, with not enough fingers and toes to stop up them all.This movie gets a bad rap maybe because it is not as flawless as the original RoboCop, for example the baddie Cain (Tom Noonan) is pretty listless compared to Clarence Boddiker from the first movie, and it's genuinely a nastier piece of work, however it contains its fair share of iconic moments, and ends up closer to being a horror movie than anything else, just absolutely haunting.",RoboCop 2
74,Min111,RoboCop is still better,5,18 January 2019,"RoboCop 2 is an interesting one. I don't know what to make of this one. It's definitely not as good as RoboCop, but I would still say it's a good movie, and I would also say it's an underrated one. It has the level of violence as we've seen in the original movie, but the plot is very different, and that's what I liked the most about this sequel. This sequel is mainly about drugs, and it's the duty of RoboCop and his team to bring down a drug lord and his empire. Where this movie succeeds is just how different it tried to be from its original movie, and I think that was a great thing. This movie has no ties to the original one at all. The villains or sociopathic criminal gang were pretty interesting, but I wouldn't say they were anywhere near as interesting as the ones we see in RoboCop, the first movie. When I first saw this movie, especially the first few times, I didn't like it for some reason. But seeing it a few times afterwards, it does seem to get better for some strange reason. Like I said, I don't know what to make of RoboCop 2, really. It's good that a sequel was made, but I think RoboCop 2 is still an average movie at best. In this movie, it's a battle between RoboCop and RoboCop 2. I prefer RoboCop for obvious reasons.",RoboCop 2
75,LebowskiT1000,Excellent Sequel! Great film!,9,15 November 2002,"I don't think anyone is going to argue that the first Robocop film in the series is, by far, the best!  But, I still think this installment is very good and has a lot of good things to offer.  The story is quite interesting and pretty well thought out.  The characters are pretty much the same as the first film, nothing terribly new there.  The special effects are absolutely superb and the action is done rather well throughout the film.Like any film, this film has some flaws.  One thing that really bothered me is that they made Robocop more of a Blue-ish color instead of a silver or grey color, it would looked better if they had stuck to the original color. Also, there are a few scenes that are meant to be comedic, but just didn't pull through.  Other than that, I thought the film was rather good.The new cyborg in this film, aptly named ""Robocop 2"" is astonishing in every way.  I thought it was a phenomenal design and beautifully done!  The weaponry on this cyborg was quite impressive as well.The actors in this film did a fine job, I can't think of any that I disliked and the direction of Irvin Kershner (The Empire Strikes Back) was quite good as well.Even though I liked this film a great deal, I still wouldn't recommend it to everyone.  If you saw and liked the original RoboCop, then I think you really ought to see this one, I'm not saying you'll like it, I would hope that you do, but you still may not (as many reviewers on this site have made clear).  I would say that if you like a good sci-fi film, then you should check this film out, and I hope you like it.  Anyhow, thanks for reading,-Chris",RoboCop 2
76,Horror-yo,Some good but ultimately quite average,6,28 January 2019,"The number one issue with this sequel is it doesn't live up to the original in terms of atmosphere and impact. The first one was so brutal, so heart-wrenching, so authentic, so powerful, so real... it was like an experience, something akin to going to a live show. That kind of movie. Whether this one has interesting themes, holds up well enough on its own as an action sci-fi blockbuster... won't address that point of falling way short in terms of atmosphere.It's way more focused on the action and had much bigger production than the first, much more exploding and stuff, but also less violence. It's cleaner, and more polished, and lacks that raw energy at that. The philosophical themes are more obvious, the pace of the film is slower, and the character arcs aren't quite developed right: we get a sense of what the film-makers are aiming at, what they're saying, but ultimately the characters aren't memorable enough in the end. Whereas both the villain and the good guy from the original, are unforgettable.6/10.",RoboCop 2
77,Aylmer,Underrated Sadistic Sequel,7,17 July 2014,"Obviously inferior to the first ROBOCOP in just about every way, this imaginatively titled sequel at least has the benefit of not having to waste a lot of time setting up the concept and gets right down to business right away. While Verhoeven's ironic and darkly comedic over- the-top touch is largely absent, the level of bleakness and icky unpleasantness manages to surpass the original.PRO'S:There's a lot more action and unpredictability than in the original, which was tighter and moved faster but let's face it, felt more formulaic.Dark seedy atmosphere brilliantly set up in the opening scene and it never lets up. This time there's drugs and corrupt cops in addition to the usual corporate extortion and anarchy as featured in the first movie.This film features some of the best stop-motion animation I've ever seen and there's a lot of it, beating out even the works of Ray Harryhausen, David Allen, and Jim Danforth. I'm shocked that none were involved with this film. Much like in the original, it's difficult in many scenes to tell what's practical and what's matted in. It makes one wonder what stop-motion could look like now had the movie studios stuck with honing the craft rather than abandoning it in favor of much-cheaper CGI.The fake commercials and newscasts are just as good as in the original, keeping things moving along briskly and with the right dose of dark comedy here and there. They even nicely tie in with the main plot more- so than in the original.Most of the surviving original cast returns.Oddly enough I liked Leonard Rosenmann's score almost as much as Basil Poledouris's music in the original. I'm not sure why they decided to go with a new direction with the music, and at times it sounds a little too much like STAR TREK IV, but overall I'd say it fits very well.CONS:As intentionally grim as the film is, it's just not very ""fun"". There's a lot of nasty scenes such as when a policeman is tortured by a deranged surgeon and a brain transplantation scene which is needlessly protracted. I feel they misunderstood Verhoeven's intentions in the original to make things like a comic book and just figured lots of violence and unpleasantness was the same thing.The writing and characterizations are much less compelling than in the original. Murphy and Louis are given very little interesting to do, leaving it to the villains to carry the show. This feels exacerbated by the overall much lower-quality performances. The goofball playing the mayor really just didn't fit with everything else in the movie.The level of realism is quite lacking asking us to believe that a well- organized gang would defer to a 12-year-old kid. I'd almost call it fun social commentary, but in this regard the film takes itself oddly seriously. A lot feels missing here, with a lot of established villains just disappearing rather than being killed off.Generally there's a just a lack of imagination all-round. We learn nothing new about Robocop (outside of that he's willing to turn away from his old family) and don't really get to see him enough. The film seems to react more to the original film rather than add to its canon.Bottom Line:All-in-all though I'd call this film fairly successful. It's hampered by a lack of creativity and intelligence but gives us more Robocop doing his thing. At least it's nowhere nearly as insulting as ""3"" or the remake.",RoboCop 2
78,departed07,A new director who almost emulates the task with less comic relief,7,28 June 2008,"""Robocop 2"" is the sequel to the popular 1987 film directed by Paul Verhoeven where the original film was a work of action and comic work where the film itself was a satire with a plot and not offending anybody. The premise of the first film was a homage to Frankenstein with the idea of using the remains of a dead cop to create a crime fighting cyborg where it didn't have sentiments or show emotions except to kick ass.The sequel leaves off after the first film ended with Robocop (Peter Weller) being a success with Omni Consumer Products (or OCP) paying more for their product than giving the officers in Detroit causing a strike in the city until all demands are met. The city is no better than it was before; prostitution, robbery, rape, homelessness, especially drugs are all on the rise thanks to OCP wanting to sell out its citizens to make ways for a novel city while the only one to do justice is Robocop with his partner Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) at his side.The new villain in the film is Cain (Tom Noonan) who supplies the popular drug Nuke in the city where he's untouchable. He's a sadistic madman who doesn't leave any witnesses while paying off by politicians and the police. He even orders his goons to dissect a cop in one scene where audience members might be a little more comfortable with Clarence Bodericker (Kurtwood Smith) of the first movie since not only did he give classic punchlines but at the same time wasn't that much of a monster to look at (Ex. He lets a couple of hookers leave before killing the main target).The subplot of Robocop 2, hence the title, is that while OCP doesn't want to pay the officers their pension or help the citizens of Detroit, they want to use their money to make a Robocop 2 to create competition for the original robot while making the city safe with their new innovation.Irvin Kershner, who directed ""The Empire Strikes Back"", brings more darkness than the original where all it's missing was the comic relief, even the commercials themselves looked depressing. On the other hand, it was great seeing Peter Weller playing the role of Robocop one more time before deciding to do other projects. The best parts about the movie are the action sequences including the final standoff between the hero and the villain.It's good, but nothing will ever beat the first movie.",RoboCop 2
79,beresfordjd,A Crock,3,7 February 2015,"What a crock! A lousy second rate film bereft of ideas other than to repeat the first movies action clichés. I guess I really was not expecting anything else although I did enjoy the satiric points of the first film. The villains look like villains and the good guys likewise. There is very little light and shade in the film. It was a done deal after the original Robocop and was only bound to repeat scenarios and themes. A cynical attempt to cash in on the first film was always going to fail artistically, and fail it does. The effects are not great and all in all it is a disappointment. The use of a child actor as a villain was somewhat new and surprising but realistically a robocop would have been programmed to destroy any criminal of any age.",RoboCop 2
80,danielcereto,Acceptable sequel,6,1 April 2021,"RoboCop 2 is an acceptable sequel but far from the original. Even the cast is good and the Fx's not cheap it does not have the greatness and originality from the first one. So, overall an acceptable sequel.",RoboCop 2
81,Al_The_Strange,RoboCop 2 review,8,1 February 2014,"After a phenomenally exciting and bloody debut, who wouldn't want more of RoboCop? While this sequel doesn't quite carry as much manic energy or thematic strength as Paul Verhoeven's film, it does continue in the same vein and deliver more of the same. It's still a wild, ultraviolent world full of rip-roaring action and pulp.RoboCop 2 boasts some decent standout moments. Its opening is an intensely seedy sequence that tracks multiple people getting attacked and mugged, one after another, setting things up for RoboCop to bust in and take care of business. There are a few decent chases and shootouts, especially during the finale, which pits RoboCop against a robot criminal. The film suffers just a little bit of drag, but it manages to maintain the same tone and spirit of the original film, making it consistently entertaining. Yep, there are even a few great fake commercials thrown in.The story takes a few random tangents, but they are good ones. If you ever wondered what was going on with Murphy's family, this film expands a bit more on that. The film takes a pretty amusing turn when OCP decides to transform RoboCop into a less violent crime-fighter, focusing more on community service and being all goody-good. The film's main track, however, dives into a conflict surrounding drugs, gangsters, corporate greed, and OCP trying to find a better RoboCop. It all adds up to a pretty decent expansion on the original story, and it's quite fun overall. When it comes to the finer points, however, the satire, social themes, and themes of humanity will come up a little dry when compared to the first film.Irvin Kershner directs this film competently, with solid photography and editing. Peter Weller and Nancy Allen reprise their roles comfortably, and everybody else does a decent enough job. It can be a little startling (maybe even offensive) to see a kid playing a serious gangster role, complete with adult language. Writing is okay. This production uses good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is okay.Not quite as tight or deep as the first film, but this sequel still offers a satisfying follow-up, and it is pretty darn fun. Recommended for anybody who wants more RoboCop.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Good)",RoboCop 2
82,Cinemaniac1984,Not the same as the original but it's still great entertainment though it's a very underrated and unappreciated sequel.,7,28 December 2020,"Peter Weller returns as the titular cyborg law enforcer in Robocop 2. I still enjoyed Robocop 2 and I thought it was great entertainment even though it couldn't reach the bar set by the first movie. Nancy Allen returns as Murphy's former partner Officer Anne Lewis. Irvin Kershner (The Empire Strikes Back) takes over the director's chair from Paul Verhoeven.Robocop 2 sees Robocop/Alex Murphy battling Cain (Tom Noonan), a psychotic drug dealer with a Messiah complex who is distributing the highly addictive drug Nuke on the streets of Detroit (actually filmed in Houston, Texas). Not only is the new drug popular on the street, the city has descended into chaos to the point of lawlessness. The Detroit Police Department is on strike following the termination of their pension pland and cutting their salaries and crime rates are soaring (art imitating life in 2020). Ruthless conglomerate Omni Consumer Products (OCP) is close to a successful takeover of Detroit which is on verge of bankruptcy (art imitating life in 2013) to begin construction of Delta City. Detroit Mayor Kuzak (Willard E Pugh) is also being made the scapegoat for Detroit being heavily in debt.Alongside Cain, his gang includes the foul mouthed 13 year old delinquent Hob (Gabriel Damon) and Cain's lover Angie (the late Gaylin Gorg).OCP is also developing a project led by psychologist Dr Juliette Faxx (Belinda Bauer) to replace Robocop with a highly advanced cyborg that can think like a criminal. Though the OCP President (Dan O'Hurley) and Johnson (Felton Perry) are reluctant at first, Dr Faxx successfully convinces them that this project will be a success and she is given approval.Cain is selected as a suitable candidate after being hospitalised and left on life support after coming off second best during a confrontation with Robocop after Robocop successfully rallies the striking police officers to raid Cain's hideout. A clash of the titans follows when Robocop battles Cain, now known as Robocop 2, a more powerful and advanced cyborg that is even more ruthless. There can only be one Robocop in Detroit and the crumbling city isn't big enough for the both of them.Robocop 2 lacked the same spark from the 1987 original and the clever satire was sorely missed, but it's still great fun and it's still an underrated and underappreciated science fiction actioner. Robocop 2 was also an ultraviolent movie like the original movie. The cast was excellent, and without a doubt Peter Weller will always be remembered as Robocop. It was great to see Nancy Allen return as Anne Lewis. Dan O'Hurley as the Old Man and Felton Perry return as Johnson but both of them don't have the same conscience from the first movie instead are looking out for themselves and their own interests. Tom Noonan made a great villain as Cain/Robocop 2. Gabriel Damon stole every scene he was in as the foul mouthed 13 year old delinquent Hob.Peter Weller wisely declined to return for Robocop 3. Unfortunately for the series, the third movie steered away from the ultraviolent, foul mouthed eye candy and turned it into a watered down, child friendly movie to appeal to the kids who were fans of the animated series. Such a shame that this decision brought on the demise of the series.7/10.",RoboCop 2

And I just don't get the hate towards this film. The evil kid leader, Tom Noonan, and the ""Nuke"" drug are all cool characters and ideas. I mean its not as good as the original for some reason RoboCop is blue? and Irvin Kershner does a good job, but, he isn't Paul Verhoeven. The nutty futuristic satire is still here and most of all the surviving cast from the original come back. The final fight between RoboCop and the evil Tom Noonan robot is fun to.",RoboCop 2
85,TheMarwood,I need nuke to sit through this again,4,25 June 2014,"Every few years I find myself thinking if RoboCop 2 was really as bad as I remembered it being, or was I projecting my enjoyment of it's predecessor on the sequel -- then after about 2 minutes into yet another viewing, it's clear just how off the mark this film is. The commercials are as soulless and forced as this rushed cash grab of a sequel and the film begins with an embarrassment of over acting and over the top violence. We start off with the three of the lamest criminals and some of the worst scenery chewing day players to ever act in a film. The actor who gives a line reading of ""I really like this gun, man"" brings ham to a whole new level and the tone of RoboCop 2 remains as obnoxious and over the top. Director Irvin Kershner has no command of this material and the attempts at subversive humor are cartoonish and manhandled. What worked so well in the first film was Murphy regaining his humanity and the first thing this film does is take it away. Murphy watching his family from his car sets off alarm bells at OCP when his wife threatens to sue and then somehow without clearance or any reason to be there she materializes to where Murphy is kept to sleep and be programmed - despite that she sent in her lawyer to speak on her behalf about Murphy leaving her and her son alone. Because this film decides to sidestep any challenging content that would take effort to write, Murphy basically tells her to get lost and that her husband is dead. He is then reprogrammed which makes him into a lame punchline of a joke that goes on for far too long, as he malfunctions being super nice and shooting at a person smoking a cigarette. Nancy Allen has said the shooting of RoboCop 2 was the worst experience of her career and that Kershner couldn't stand her and wrote her out of as many scenes as possible. Her character Lewis is simply a connection to the first film and provides barely anything to the narrative. Instead we get Willard E. Pugh, who plays the mayor, in a performance that's so over the top and terrible that he should be banned from ever appearing on screen. It's dreadful performances like this that Kershner can not modulate and just cranks everything in this film up to an 11 out of 10. Peter Weller has also complained that the film has no real 3rd act and he is right, the film begins all these plot threads about Detroit being manipulated by OCP, Murphy stalking his family, nuke addiction, political corruption, police strikes and so on - and every thread is dropped to have a machine brawl for an ending. RoboCop vs Cain. A drug addicted robot with a computerized face on a monitor that makes the computer effects in The Lawnmower Man look Oscar worthy in comparison. For reasons I can't understand, RoboCop 2 has gained a full point here on IMDb where since the beginning of this site sat deservingly around 4.7 and as of this date is at a 5.7",RoboCop 2
86,Coffee_in_the_Clink,Brainless sequel but it revels in it's own silliness and is almost as enjoyable as it's predecessor,6,27 January 2020,"Three years after Paul Verhoeven's ""Robocop"" exploded on to the scene, it's inevitable sequel followed, to be directed by none other than the man who directed ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and written by Batman comic book legend Frank Miller. With a pairing like that you would expect greatness; but what you get is B-grade carnage and a plot line that is so thin that it is forced to jack up the dark humor and gore elements in an attempt to emulate it's predecessor. Terrible, really, but it is very enjoyable and not at all as bad as it's reputation suggests.Detroit City is in turmoil. OCP are working hard to build their megacity at the expense of the people of Detroit. The police are on strike and a new lethal narcotic called Nuke has hit the streets. Robocop has his work cut out for him, as he must battle the drug gang led by the Charlie Manson-esque Cain and navigate the politics of the precinct, all while OCP consider him a threat and look to reprogramme him.The most memorable thing about this outing for me will be the dark humor that is as strong here as in the first film. The satirical TV adverts are brilliant and there's some brilliant on-liners. I didn't think it was as violent or gruesome as the first film. Overall, it is enjoyable for what it is, but considering the talent that was behind it I can't help but wonder at the potential it had and how it should have been as good, if not better, than it's brilliant predecessor.",RoboCop 2

88,jpintar,"Cynical, Depressing",5,1 July 2004,"When this movie was first released in 1990, it was widely criticized for being even more violent than the first Robocop and having an incoherent plot.  Seeing it recently, it still has a cynical view of the future.  Some of those things have come true, such as 10 year old children stealing, committing violence, and handling automatic weapons.  That seemed far fetched in 1990 but not in a post Columbine world where children have easy access to these weapons and use them.  Taking an entire city private sounds like one of those things that current President George W. Bush might think of, since he wants to privatize everything else. As for the movie itself, the action scenes are very well done, especially the battle between Robocops.  Peter Weller and Nancy Allen do a good job in their returning roles.  However some plotlines, such as how much of Robocop is still Murphy are talked about and then dropped.  The movie also has an overemphasis on torture that could have been toned down.  I'm not a person who usually complains about violence in movies, but here the violence is excessive.  Overall a mixed bag that gets 5/10 from me.",RoboCop 2
89,Quebec_Dragon,How Robocop 2 holds up 20 years later and compared to the first,5,5 July 2011,"I watched it as a teen way back when and the only thing I remembered was the gruesome scene involving the removal of a brain. I wondered why that was. Probably because compared to the first Robocop (which is pretty good, and that I remembered fairly well), it's not just not a very memorable, or good, movie for that matter. The sarcastic newscast and ads are still there, probably better even with stronger emphasis on environmental issues. The film starts reasonably well with Robocop fighting crime alone, stalking his former family and a powerful scene where the Corporation tries to brainwash him into thinking he's just a machine. Wow, there might have been some psychological depth and dramatic intensity building up from that but that was soon forgotten. There was a clever twist to make Robocop more politically correct (he does tend to shoot first, ask questions later), but it was a bit exaggerated (as in cheesy) and not really exploited well enough. I also thought there were way too many kids for that kind of violent movie as if they were trying to appeal to them. I know the creators must have thought it would be shocking, but almost every time, it brought down the quality. The criminal kid wasn't good enough of an actor to have such importance and so many scenes. Another acting weakness was the mayor who was so over-the-top that there's no way he could have been elected in the first place. The villains also weren't as ""good"" as the first film. The female partner cop, who should have been developed more, honestly didn't have much to work with. Peter Weller as Robocop did fine but he also slightly amplified his robotic movements(a good point in the first) perhaps a tad too much, sometimes bordering on corny.They obviously wanted to give us more action for our money but those shooting scenes felt really overdrawn to the point of tiresome. There's a very long sequence in the second half with no Robocop (reason for that but still) and it just goes on and on (15 minutes but it felt longer). The vehicle pursuits and close-in robotic fighting were more interesting but not astounding. Special effects-wise, I was impressed with the way the ""hurt"" Robocop was portrayed. The animation on Robocop's robotic antagonist was better than the one for ED-209 (a slight weakness from the first film) but unfortunately the design of that robot was far less memorable. I honestly didn't remember anything about it (except the lame computer generated face display but technical limitations of the time I suppose). Overall, I think they tried to add more of everything that people liked from the first film, but here, it should have been a case of less is more. In particular, the action scenes are too long and not thrilling enough. They tried at first to deepen Robocop character, then to change it, then finally overlooked it in the last part in favor of action (when he was there). Robocop 2 is certainly watchable, but disappointing compared to the strong first. I would just rent it and then only if you liked the first.Rating: 5 out of 10 (average)",RoboCop 2
90,geminiredblue,Second Time's Not Always A Charm,6,25 February 2014,"The original ROBOCOP was a brilliant sci-fi thriller that was original and imaginative. It had an acid wit and well-rounded characters (both heroes and villains.) After its success, sequels were inevitable. And like most sequels, ROBOCOP 2 fails to live up to the first film. All the elements from the original are still present, but everything feels like a re-tread. In ROBOCOP 2, some time has passed since the events of the first film. Crime has gotten worse in the city of Detroit now that the police department has gone on strike. In the midst of the chaos a new street drug emerges called Nuke. A new gang of dangerous street thugs led by Cain (Tom Noonan) are controlling the city's drug business with an iron fist. Robocop is called in to track them down. Meanwhile, the head honchos at OCP want to go further with the Robocop program, unfortunately, no other candidates are able to match Murphy's prowess. Eventually Cain gets captured and resurrected into the bigger meaner Robocop 2. There's a phenomenal battle between both Robocops at the finale of the movie, but that's about all this film has going for it. Even the occasional jab at humor can't liven up this humdrum sequel.

91,stormhawk2021,He's back.,5,13 August 2017,"As a film is very bad, as a sequel is embarrassing. Such are the Many people who did not directly understand the motivations of Paul Verhoeven when he made the mythical movie Robocop (1987). So even more controversy produced the sequel to this movie, produced three years later, and directed by Irvin Kershner (the director of the mythical Empire Strikes Back). It is true that Robocop 2 (1990) does not live up to its predecessor, but what we have to leave today is to underestimate a movie that, had it not been for other circumstances (other than the film) would have considered cult.Yes, it is not Verhoeven. Does this mean that the movie is a mere copy intended solely to make money? The truth is that the sequel directed by Kershner has a soul of its own, which gives it its own singularity. Surely, because we have to keep in mind that the project involved the famous comic writer Frank Miller, who gave a totally personal touch. You just have to see the numerous outputs of tone that the film presents. Those who have seen it will forever remember the contortionist fiddler, no doubt, although they are constant.The first RoboCop showed us a Detroit that could be mired in corruption and delinquency, but maintained a certain dignity. However, the story that Kershner presents us goes much further, both aesthetically and thematically. To begin with we must point out that the Detroit that we have before our eyes is much darker. In fact, one can even intuit the influence of Gotham that only a year ago had presented Tim Burton, with his Batman (1989). Detroit has something of a comic, but not of those 60's comics that did not intend to break any moral barrier, but quite the opposite, of the hooligans comrades by which the adolescents were able to make their parents angry. The crazy and suicidal tone of these comic strips is also reflected in the film itself, from the humorous moments (which are not few and pretend at all times to show that the film is not at any time seriously), through the language used or even with one of the protagonists, who is a child (although arms take, in fact the film breaks with the preconceived idea that there can be a child doing bad). The street gangs, the corruption, the Detroit that presents the sequel is just as well thought out (or maybe in this aspect, even better) than the one of the first delivery. And it is certainly because it is where the hand of Frank Miller is most noticeable. Maybe, where he could also work more freely. Not to ignore that the film charges its inks against corporate corruption (our villain is an entrepreneur who seeks to destroy the public sphere to seize all the power of the city). An exaggerated a priori hyperbole but in reality is totally in tune with the real Detroit (and if not, let's see what it has become at the moment).The problems Robocop 2 has had are several. To start with it is a sequel. And you know that you can forgive the sagas (although as we all know, in some cases are endless) but not the sequels. But unfortunately, we also have many internal problems.The assembly does not work. The story seems to stumble and give the feeling or that they either put scissors, or cut the wings to creativity. The final third of the movie with the fight between Robocop and Cain is too long compared to what is really being told. The action sequences are eternalized and never seem to end. In addition, although the film pretends to disguise what it is through numerous strokes of humor (that eye, some are tremendously effective) in fact the story is not quite conventional (as for plot we mean) and is not able to develop the crowd of issues that could have been exploited. In fact, Robocop 2's packaging far exceeds what it teaches us inside.Also the film has enough problems with the design of special effects. At that time the go motion was being tried, and the film abused this resource in excess, causing that half-third end of the film is actually a tedious spectacle of these FX, which to make the matters worse, seen today are somewhat dantesque .",RoboCop 2
92,revival05,"""Oh my, this isn't very nice""",3,1 August 2008,"For most people, RoboCop 3 is the film that really is the big disgrace for the Robo series. It has few fans, and most people hate it for it's shameless commercial PG-13 approach. Now, I'm not going to say that RoboCop 3 is any good. Frankly, it pretty much sucks. But as far as being a properly shot and executed film, it surpasses this piece of circuit chaos. Yes, the truth of the matter is that RoboCop 2 is the worst of two bad and unnecessary sequels to a near-masterpiece. So what if RoboCop 3 turns Robo into a cartoonish super hero in a ultra mainstream production for kids to enjoy - at least it's doing it openly. I don't know where RoboCop 2 begins and ends, I don't know what or whom it's about, I don't understand what's going on in it, I don't understand which jokes are deliberate and which aren't, I will go insane if I try to understand the characters, I see nothing of any value in anything anybody is saying, I can't believe anybody looked at the shooting script and figured it would work and I can't believe that Irvin Kirshner saw the finished result and figured that he liked what he see. He probably didn't by the way, neither Miller, nor Weller nor Allen did. It's not hard to see why.Now, RoboCop 2 has it's fans, I know this. Mostly they belong to this league of absolute anti-pretensions, dismissing anybody who expected any depth, or subject matter from the first film, as academic Roger Ebert Sith apprentices. It's just a lot of fun, a good piece of action and great entertainment, the argument goes. Yeah well, I guess if you just don't listen to what any of the characters are saying you could fool yourself that we might as well have Arnold in the suit instead of Weller. Don't get me wrong, I like a good action film, with pure entertainment value as it's only - most satisfying - virtue. But RoboCop 2, sir, ain't no such thing.Look at the first couple of scenes. This horrible actor makes Robo repeat that he's just a machine, and then goes into this operatic speech about how he could never be a man, where-after Murphy's wife (who's suing OCP for robot-stalkings) walks in out of the blue and have this sad little moment with him, and then is never heard of again! I surely would like to go in to this film scene by scene, because every one has these kind of absurdities in them. It's like a twelve year old fan boy has done the screenplay, the characters act totally random and first say this, then say that. OCP wants to stop crime with a new Robo, especially this drug called ""nuke"" but then it seems they really just want to become this big capitalist empire and control the entire city  politics are abandoned I guess, understandable given the comic relief mayor, The villain (played by Tom Noonan, who did a better version of this in Last Action Hero and that's saying a lot) is an addict, but is still used for this machine. The woman behind it all has an agenda which is impossible to understand.Speaking of twelve year olds, this film has the infamous role of ""Hub"", this mad kid who swears and kills people, played by a child actor. I'm not going to be all moral about it, it's a free world and if you want a psycho kid in your action movie, go for it. I don't know how much of Frank Miller's original vision was put into this, but the credits at least acknowledge him as conceiver of the ""story"". And, if I zoom out, I could see this as being quite a cool character. It's grim for sure, to have a maniac killer kid but then again this is the world of RoboCop and who would be surprised? This whole business with the OCP trying to become this giant monopoly over everything, is properly dystopian and good as well. Also, the idea of RoboCop getting in touch with his wife and kid, having them embedded into the story somehow - would also be great, and as far as I can see a natural and logical step if they now had to make a RoboCop sequel.But, of course, these are just ideas. As many people have already said, the screenplay is 100% mess. The kid has one scene (the torture scene) where it's hinted that he in fact is just a stereotype messed up kid, and then we have this unimaginable scene where he is dying and gets all soft and friendly towards ol' tin head. Why doesn't he just take up his uzi and try to take him down with his last breath? Isn't that what his character would do? Does he give his life a little second thought there on his death bed? Not necessarily, given that his last words are ""it sucks"", so why? It really makes no sense, and this can be said about everybody, no everything, in this film. IS there a strike in the police force? IS RoboCop machine or man? What's the deal with turning Robo into this community service machine for 10 minutes? I mean, sure, it's pretty funny I wouldn't deny that. But why build it up, and then discard it? And why the hell is Allen so criminally underused? and what is it Weller has an obvious urge to express with his character and yeah, well, the threads are many and the mess is enormous.This review is just as messed up as the film. The only reason I give an extra star up there is because of the actors from the first film, I'm sure they had good intentions with it. I mean it's something somewhat stable, some kind of anchor in this sea of bad movie making.",RoboCop 2

It comes as a surprise then that Robocop 2 invests more time being a note-for-note rendition of the original than developing new strands left over from the previous film. Early on it shows promise of depth as we see Murphy/RoboCop still haunted by old memories while stalking his traumatised widowed wife. Unfortunately, the film abruptly abandons exploring this idea and instead shifts it's focus to straight up corruption and street crime as megalomaniacal company Omni Consumer Products (OCP) attempts once again to create it's own RoboCop with predictably poor results. Dan O'Herlihy returns for more fun as the 'old man' and his new assistant Dr Faxx (Belinda Bauer) adds some pleasingly wicked charm but there's often a lack of impetus and a sense of going through the motions. As 'Robo', Peter Weller gets the chance to indulge comedy when his programming is temporarily sabotaged, prompting him to behave erratically which is fun for a few scenes. Just like in the Verhoeven original, we're treated to a collection of amusing infomercial's that act as welcome relief inbetween the gunfire and mayhem. It's after this that things start to really hit the skids. It's not that RoboCop 2 is a bad film, it's just disappointing that it isn't brave enough to separate from the formula of the original. Director Irvin Kershner did the seemingly impossible with Empire Strikes Back in as much as he made a film that used much loved characters from a celebrated film and set them off on a new adventure that enriched what came before without resorting to mimicry. RoboCop 2 chooses to go down the route of mimcry being the most sincere form of flattery, but for cinema audiences, that usually just spells dull.",RoboCop 2
96,BadWebDiver,Vicious black comedy-action story,7,25 August 2002,"This is a dark comic story that follows up the original sci-fi satire movie.Spoiler warningThere is slightly less blood-letting in this one that the earlier film, though it still contains some very graphic scenes - including a live mutilation and a kid getting killed.I preferred the satirical humor of this movie to the earlier one, especially the news pieces and the dig at bland beurocratic ""political correctness"". I noticed a slight parallel in the story to Dicken's ""Oliver Twist"" with Tom Noonan's character as a futuristic Fagan, and Gabe Damon as an Artful Dodger type.  I enjoyed the way one of the lead robots of the story is given some personality, twitching its grabbers in anticipation of a treat.My personal favorite scene is a news report on the meltdown of a nuclear power plant in the Amazonian rainforest.  The newsreader announces that ""Greenpeace is complaining that this is one of the worst natural disasters of our time"".

Something is just not right.The story is that just like the first installment, the cops are on strike and OCP needs to do something...again. For some reason, they want to replace Robocop. Robo in the first movie was a successful crime-fighter. So why ask for replacement? The story needs work.A villain here is a kid named Hob. Hob is just plain annoying. He is about 12 and just reeks the place up. Hob comes off not menacing, just irritating. Another villain here is a drug lord named Cain. He is not even close to as menacing and likable as the first movie's villain Clarence Boddicker. Also just like the first(how original),the bad guy has help from OCP as well. How about a villain that needs no ties to some corporate douche and be a regular modern villain? How bad is this? Not dreadful, but damn bad. One other piece of Robocrap, why do some people come to make Robo a tree hugger? Robocop was created to fight the never ending crime in old Detroit. He was a huge crime fighter and no one ever stepped up and had Robo's back after the good he did in the first movie? Lame.This movie had no interesting characters at all.(All the good ones were killed in the first)This movie also suffers from being unintentionally funny. Who cares if the director did The Empire Strikes Back. Sure, that was good, but this is not. He did Robocop no justice.The Last Word: A watered-down Robocop. This is a bad movie as many say. This is not as gritty or interesting as the first. This is a lame sequel.",RoboCop 2
99,BrickNash,Stylish and worthy sequel to the brilliant original!,8,16 June 2013,"Following up the original Robocop, which is considered to be a groundbreaking masterpiece in dark, violent movie making was never going to be easy. Robocop 2 has 'copped' some flak since it's release in 1990 but was it all justified? In a nutshell no, not at all.The film is much lighter in tone and the humour is more obvious and not so dark plus the film has lost a lot of that very 'uneasy' feeling of the first one in that it's not quite so shocking. Do not be fooled though, this is not tame by any standards, the gore is still strong and all the phoney adverts and news satire that made the first film so gloriously corny are present.The makers of the movie made a wise choice and rather than take a risk and explore unknown territory they simply offered up more of the same, which is no bad thing at all.Robocop 2 is a fine sci-fi action film with some genuinely chilling moments and when compared to action films of today with their oodles of CGI nonsense and not much else, Robocop 2 stands head a shoulders above the lot.The effects may be dated but that in no way implies that they are bad and they were done with complete skill and there is plenty of comic book style story to fill in between the blasting action.Robocop 2 stands tall and proud alongside it's older brother and while not quite reaching the phenomenal heights of the prequel it can be counted as a stylish and polished action film which continues the story of Robocop, nothing more nothing less!",RoboCop 2
100,LuboLarsson,Terrible,3,29 May 2007,"I recently picked up all three Robocop films in one box set, rather cheaply and the only reason I did this was for the special edition of the superb first one. I have seen Robocop 2 before but not for 17 years, the year it came out. I have never watched it since because I can still remember how disappointed I was when I discovered how appalling it really is. Its a complete mess really, it has all the signs of a troubled production with so many sub-plots going on at the same time. It has a very uneven tone also and it is also one of the nastiest films I have ever seen. I don't mind a little violence, the first one was incredibly violent but this one is just plain nasty. Also the SFX is terrible even for 1990, say hello to bad stop motion. Also having a drug dealing, cursing kid as a villain is just a little too much. Peter Weller at least had the common sense not to return for the next one. The only positive thing I can say for this film is it does have a couple of nice gags, like the thank you for not smoking one and the kiddie baseball team robbing an electrics store.

102,Vampenguin,"Not as good as #1, but still great!",8,27 May 2006,"The first Robocop film is one of my all-time favourite movies and easily one of the greatest action films ever made. Though this first sequel doesn't quite live up to it's predecessor, it's still a great movie.Peter Weller returns as the title character, and does as good a job as he did in his first outing as the character. The rest of the returning cast do great jobs as well, and so do the new cast members. Tom Noonan of Manhunter fame fills the role of the main villain this time around, and while he does a good job with what he has, the character was rather poorly written. Nowhere near as awesome as Clarence Boddicker from part 1, though I must say he gets pretty cool once he gets ""upgraded"".I think the real strength of the film lies in the fact that there are few, if any, black and white characters. Most of them have their flaws or their virtues, even heroes like Robocop and villains like Cain. The only purely evil character I can think of is The Old Man, who I must say is a great, subtle villain.Last but not least, I have to mention the humor of the film. The scene after Robocop has had the extra objectives installed and attempts to arrest a corpse was hilarious! Overall, this is a great film. A lot different and not quite as good as it's predecessor, but still a lot of fun and really good.8/10",RoboCop 2
103,refinedsugar,Doesn't Measure Up.,6,14 March 2001,"Okay now we're just being fed formula and who could blame them after the critical and financial business the original Robocop did. This sequel (beyond letting us know the people behind these movies are obviously trying to make a working franchise) tells us how hard it is to duplicate success on those rare instances where a science fiction movie breaks the mold and follow it up with something just as good or better. It's a weird trait that many sequels to successful movies succumb to, but then again, when the original does so many things right some level of disappointment or failings seem almost guaranteed. Dreary atmosphere, a workable story, sprinkles of dark humor, satisfying action pieces and some real emotion. The original had it all. It'd be a fantasy to think we were going to get this and more in a sequel.We don't. This outing finds less of the dark humor and less of Murphy's humanity as he's tasked with going up against a new underground drug taking over New Detroit. Of course, things will come to a violent head and once again it will be Robocop's prime directive to make things right. Tom Noonan, who starts as the main villain is perhaps the best and the worse. A good actor can take an underwritten part farther than it was supposed to go, but only so far. Hence a key problem. Like most drug barons, especially in movie land, the one he plays is paranoid and prone to using violence. Which means the pursuit of cliché set pieces and scenarios like an obvious showdown between him and Robocop before the end (in some form). What maybe you don't expect is when half-way through the movie, the main villainy force becomes a 14 year old successor to a drug empire.The premise is simple enough. Part man, mostly machine. He's not prone to annoyances normal human beings have to deal with like being shot, bleeding, dying... that sort of thing. He can be as detached from the world as he wants to be because let's face it, he is detached. Peter Weller reprises as Robocop. Nancy Allen is again along for the ride as his partner. OCP is still OCP. The headquarters for a faceless mega corporation built on greed. Those things haven't changed, but other more intimate story and atmosphere elements have.Robocop 2 ends up not being a horrible outing. It is still very much entertaining and in due part to memories established by the original, but give me back more of that dark trashy New Detroit atmosphere as seen in the original. Give me less throwaway action scenes, 14-year old boy villains and mediocre stop motion effects. Most of all give me back the feeling that Robocop was fresh. I know that's hard to fulfill, but at least give me a glimmer of hope.",RoboCop 2
104,robotbling,A crappy rehash of the first film,4,12 December 2011,"(www.plasticpals.com) RoboCop 2 feels like a rehash of the first film, and the few new ideas introduced are bad ones. RoboCop is once again hunting down a drug cartel in Old Detroit, the corrupt mega corporation OCP is up to its old dirty tricks, and there are references to trendy topics like the Ozone Layer. Where the first film had an understated and dark sense of humor, here RoboCop clowns around for cheap laughs. It insults the viewer's intelligence and defies believability too often to dismiss.It doesn't take long for RoboCop to discover that the drug cartel is operating out of an abandoned industrial site that looks awfully familiar. I guess all criminals in Detroit have secret hideouts in old steel mills. They soon capture our hero with some sort of electrical harpoon before dismantling him piece by piece in a caricature of officer Murphy's death scene from the first film. They decide to drop what's left of him in front of police headquarters (rather than tossing them into a trash compactor) which makes rebuilding him rather convenient.The first film was certainly ridiculous in its own way, but the sequel really jumps the shark. One of the main villains is a little boy who becomes a crime lord. Then there's the robbery perpetrated by what appears to be a Little League team. And to top it all off OCP's resident psychologist decides that death row inmates are the best candidates to become next-generation RoboCops. According to her reasoning, there's nothing wrong with giving the worst criminals power over a nearly invincible robot body.It doesn't make a shred of sense, but in the end, the drug cartel's leader is the one who undergoes the operation. As one might expect, he proves difficult to control and soon goes on a rampage. Like the rest of the movie, the final confrontation hasn't aged well at all. There are some pretty decent animatronic special effects, but the computer graphics look like something from an N64 game. And the jerky stop-motion scenes have about as much impact as a pair of action figures grappling in an amateur animation project. It's pretty amazing that only one year later the incredible Terminator 2 would hit theaters.In an attempt to appeal to a wider demographic – and perhaps to sell more action figures – RoboCop 2 forfeits the originality and edginess that made the first one popular. Still, as bad as it is, it's probably something of a guilty pleasure for some sci-fi fans.",RoboCop 2

109,Ben-Hibburd,Robocop 2 Review.,4,15 May 2017,"Robocop 2 is directed by Irvin Kershner(The Empire Strikes Back). The film sees Peter Weller return in the role of Alex Murphy a half man/half cyborg police officer. Nancy Allen also reprises her role as Murphy's partner, Officer Annie Lewis.After the events of the first film Murphy is still coming to terms about his own mortality. This was a sub plot that started out with a-lot of potential that only Sci-Fi can do. Asking questions about when human conciseness ends and artificial intelligence begins. This was however quickly sidelined, in favour for a plot about a local Detroit gang pushing a new type of drug called Nuke. This gang is led by a man with a delirious god complex named Cain(Tom Noonan). This section of the film falls into all the standard clichés of an 80/90s Hollywood sequel. It has a half baked script that felt rushed into production. The action, whilst keeping it's over the top violent roots isn't as fun or engaging as the first film. It offers nothing new or original and is a let down from the interesting premise the beginning of the film had.After all the set up of the first film to build the characters of Murphy and Annie, they are completely sidelined in favour for the villains of the film. With exception of Cain, they are all poorly written and acted. They add nothing to the plot of the film. They feel like they were there too fill up screen-time that could of gone into adding more characterisation into Murphy or Annie.The biggest problem with Robocop 2 is that it takes all the subtle clever corporate America satire from the original, and bashes It over your head until you're dizzy, which Is the difference between a good film and a bad one.",RoboCop 2

112,the_mysteriousx,"Insulting, hateful, tasteless, gratuitously violent mess!",1,19 August 2004,"The first Robocop had a sense of cynical wit and a sick sense of violence. It was a fine line to walk, but Paul Verhoeven pulled it off and the film did so well, they made a sequel. How awful. (Possible Spoilers ahead - though anything that could spoil this is beyond me).Irvin Kershner is not the director for this type of film. He clearly did not understand the humor of the original and as a result the massive over-the-top senseless violence looks really bad - and worse is very distasteful. Even worse is the musical score. Leonard Rosenman was an old man from another era and the heroic, light music does not match the images on the screen at all! What was he scoring?! The Great American Hero?! Worst of all, he completely eliminated Robocop's theme from the first film, which was so memorable and perfect. Can you imagine a Superman film without John Williams' fanfare, or Indiana Jones, etc.? How could he do that?!!The plot is just a collection of ideas that don't gel. In beginning we see Robo ""stalking"" his old wife. Fine, good idea. But, they completely drop it after that. Then, there is this a stupid idea of the company reprogramming Robo to be nice. That's thrown in for 10 minutes and then is immediately dropped. Or, the silly idea that the repulsive 10 year-old drug lord reminds Robo of his son - Once again, a weak motif that is shown briefly twice and dropped. This may work in a comic book, but not on film and Frank Miller was unfortunately too inexperienced at the time and threw every idea in along with the kitchen sink. It doesn't work as a whole.Some people here seem to be praising the corporate bashing in this film and the privatization of the police. That is the best part of the film that is consistent with the first. However, in the original, the old man was a tough business man out for a profit, but ultimately fair in the end. In this film, he is just pure evil in his lust for money and power. You can't just change characters like that for no reason. And Nancy Allen's character is useless in this film, whereas in the first she was essential to Robo's search for himself. She is as gratuitous as the violence in this film.And the violence, yes the violence. I enjoy many violent, bloody films when they serve purposes and are meant to tell a story. Irvin Kershner seems to get off on human beings being blown to bits, shot to pieces, children lusting for death and torture and peoples' desire for drugs. He doesn't know when to stop. Do we really need to see every last innocent bystander (even people trying to help others) get shot up???? It is inferred when we see the bad Robocop shooting repeatedly! Instead Mr. Kershner proves he has very little taste for this type of work and creates an abominable mess that is a terrible piece of pop art and worse, a disgusting message of violence for any young person watching this film.No, this film isn't meant to be message-y and I certainly don't watch Robocop movies or Alien or Predator movies for that reason. However, when you go too far and cross the line, much of what you do must be put into question. And as for this film, in the words of the evil kid drug dealer's last words as he lay dying, ""It still sucks"".",RoboCop 2

Sure the stop-motion effects are clearly outdated, but so what? You don't go bad-mouthing Alien's guy in a suit either.As far as the storyline goes, there's nothing unique about it, but I do admire the filmmakers for the character of Hob.

The police force is now on strike since OCP decided to make changes, and crime becomes more rampant through the city. Now a large drug dealer is selling Nuke a new drug on the streets in mass.This film also shows the theme of the government attempting to make back room deals in order to prevent OCP from foreclosing the city. The current administration makes a deal with the new dealers of Nuke in order to take back the city, by getting enough money to get out of the debt in turn for ignoring the dealing of Nuke.This is a good film to watch, however some of the violence may turn some people off.",RoboCop 2

117,canadude,it ain't like being a robot in disneyland,6,10 June 2004,"""Robocop 2,"" one must remember, derives from a comic just like its predecessor. While the story is far more sordid than, say, ""Batman"" the general themes are essentially the same. Dark, crime-polluted city, a cynical, but resolute and physically-skilled hero and an enemy at every corner from the basic mugger to politicians and leaders of giant corporations who, in fascist maneuvers, take over cities for personal benefit.While ""Robocop"" and ""Batman"" dealt with these themes to the degree a film based on a comic can, ""Robocop 2"" doesn't attempt more than to shroud a nihilistically violent story in tales of morality and corruption. Nonetheless, it's damn entertaining. And often very funny, though its sense of humor could hardly be considered palatable to the majority. Consider a brilliant scene involving the freshly-removed brain-and-spine isolated in a container full of preservation-fluid, the eyeballs still attached, staring at the hollow emptiness of the open skull (skin and all) from which it was scooped and by which it was once housed. It's hilarious - if you've got the stomach for it.That's the spirit of this film which tries to disguise itself as satire, but simply cannot because its violence clamors anything else the film might pretend to be about. The violence here is extreme not necessarily in the sense of brutality (though it is that), but also in the nonchalant way in which it is presented. Though ""Robocop 2"" was not directed by Verheoven, it foreshadows his obsession with this type of violence that ""matures"" (a strange word, I understand) in films like ""Total Recall"" and ""Starship Troopers."" Ninety percent of the people who appear on screen are shot, wounded or beaten. Chests explode with fountains of blood, bullets fly tearing flesh like it wasn't human. It's so aggressive and so in tune with the general spirit of the film that it leaves little doubt about its role. This isn't the type of violence that is meant to speak or reveal but entertain.A further example: a new prototype of a police-robot is presented to the media. Constructed by the OCP corporation this is a far advanced model of the Robocop. Soon, we see its destructive power as it goes insane because it is presented a vial of a drug on which it thrives; a drug that is also the cause of the crime in the city for the ridding of which the robot was designed. So - it plows down screaming men and women, bullets tearing themselves into their legs and backs as they try to evacuate the building in a horror-show made real by their howls for help. It's almost shot as a merciless news-show wanting ratings over saved lives.In any case, this monstrous machine wanders outside, blows away some more bystanders, blows up a few police cars, piercing through the bullet-proof vests of surrounding cops and turns over a tank. At this point, the owner of OCP looks down from the balcony at the chaos and says to his subordinate: ""This isn't going to look good for OCP."" That's hilarious. Shocking carnage reduced to absolutely nothing - complete nihilism on screen. In fact, this nihilism pervades the entire film (and many like it) - simply consider the mayor of the city who goes to strike a deal with drug dealers to buy back the town from OCP. His subordinate tells him: ""These people are criminals."" The mayor responds: ""Bob, don't put labels on people."" Again, ha-ha funny. But what does it lead to? Absolutely nothing. ""Robocop 2"" is about everyone being evil, self-interested and corrupt. Even Robocop doesn't mind smashing in a face or two to get information. Violence is the only method for settling issues - and money buys violence.So yes, it's easy to laugh if you've got the stomach for it and are in for a completely vacuous story, a story of violence really, or are in a really cynical mood. In ""Robocop 2"" hundreds of people are blown away for no apparent reason, on whim really, blood erupting everywhere with startling realism and no one really seems to mind. It could be argued that the film is more honest than its predecessor which ended with a clear conclusion where good, or at least law triumphs over outlaw. It could be argued that it doesn't take the easy way out - but that'd just be a bunch of crap. The film itself isn't cynical and condemning in its tone or atmosphere - it joyfully revels and basks in this destruction. It likes the ugliness it presents. In the end the sheer nihilism of ""Robocop 2"" is packaged entertainment rather than violent satire - it doesn't have the balls, the wit and the brain to pull it off. But, brain in skull, or brain staring at shell of skull, it can be very entertaining.",RoboCop 2
118,TERMINATOR180,Violent Fun,10,27 January 2002,"Sure, the film's storyline is like that of a Comic Book, but if you enjoy to watch Peter Weller play as Robocop, the Gun-Totin' Law Enforcer of the future, this movie is as fun as the first, and better than the 3rd (which wasn't very good at all, and lacked Peter Weller)The movie actually has some suspenseful moments, but it's main purpose is to serve the bloody shoot-out craving in most of us.If you compare it to Robocop's Comic Book Spin-Offs, Cartoon Spin-Offs, and even TV Series Spin-Offs, Robocop 2 is a classic film.",RoboCop 2
119,headfulofghosts126,Missed Opportunity,5,7 November 2007,"Before this film's release fans must have been in a whirlwind of excitement. The director of Empire Strikes Back (widely regarded as one of the top sequels ever made) and the writer of The Dark Knight Returns teaming up for RoboCop. At first glance Miller seems like an ideal choice. DKR is brimming with social satire and the news broadcasts that infuse that comic are eerily similar to the Media Break segments in the first film. And maybe Miller was a great choice. We'll never really know since only fragments of his story were worked into the final script.RoboCop 2 is vastly inferior to the original but it's not the train wreck a lot of people make it out to be either. It's a movie bursting at the seams with wasted potential. They had an interesting subplot with Murphy's widow, a charismatic villain, and OCP stealing the city right from under the Mayor's nose. All interesting subplots that are never given any development or payoff. The film doesn't even really have a coherent story. It darts off in so many directions and ends up feeling like a mish mash of their favorite moments from all the different drafts. OCP refusing to bring RoboCop back online, his eventual re-programming, and even the third act introduction of RoboCop 2... these are all elements slapped together and none of them has a chance to evolve or resonate.Kershner is a competent filmmaker. Some of the scenes are incredibly well done: RoboCop's dismantling, Cain's assault on his former gang and the mayor, the last moment between Robo and the kid... but I'm not sure he was a great choice. 95% of the film takes place in daylight and everything seems so bright, shiny, and unthreatening. It looks like the film was made for a fraction of the cost of the original but that's not the case. How can the production value seem so low? Where did the money go? Robo's absent for a twenty minute stretch of time. Lewis & Reed are barely cameos. The Old Man is suddenly a vicious antagonist. The cops inexplicably end their strike and risk their lives to help Robo get revenge. But one of the biggest offenses is the score. Not only did Basil Poledouris not return, but none of his themes were used either. His RoboCop theme is iconic. This is like Superman without John Williams. The music is too hokey and chipper and the end credits overture borders on ridiculous (a choir chants ""RoboCop!"").Perhaps the flaws wouldn't seem as glaring if there wasn't the amazing first film to compare this to. It's certainly not one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And it's certainly not as bad as the next sequel. But it ain't the original. Not by a long shot.",RoboCop 2
120,eldergod-1,Better than the original.,7,10 February 2005,"The second part of the popular ""RoboCop"" series is directed by Irvin Kirstner, the master behind ""Empire Strikes Back"" and as in the Star Wars movie, he created a very good sequel, which is the best in the series. The movie is really quite slow-paced in the beginning, but it is full with memorable villains and twisted dark humor. RoboCop himself is cooler here than in the first movie and his new adversary, a bigger and better Robocop is really a formidable cyborg. The combat between the two RoboCops is excellent, but as I already mentioned, the strongest part of the film are its sardonic jokes. In conclusion: even if not as good as the Terminator movies, RoboCop 2 is a well-made scifi action, which is worth the watch.",RoboCop 2
121,CinemaCocoa,"A decent sequel, but lacks character development",6,13 July 2014,"From the director of Empire Strikes Back, the sequel to the 1987 classic is clearly designed to be a little more mainstream, quite it isn't a bad film, it certainly lacks the original's satire and a lot of the human element.RoboCop 2 sees the OCP corporation looking to refine the RoboCop Law Enforcement Unit with a new design, but cannot recreate the perfect blend of man and machine such as Alex Murphy. At the same time, they are unsympathetic to Alex's returning humanity, and demand he forget about his family. In Detroit, a drug baron is selling a new drug to the masses and causes unrest in the city's politics.RoboCop 2 is one of those sequels, a sequel fresh out of new ideas and makes do with what it has. You could say that this entire film branches only off the memorable ED-209 test sequence in the original film; so much time here is spent on the promise of a new and improved machine... despite the fact RoboCop himself isn't flawed asides from his human feelings (from the corporation's point of view, anyway). Yet the solution to this is taking the mind of a criminal and putting it into a robot? Uhhhhhm...It definitely has its flaws. This film should have focused on Alex Murphy's returning humanity and his need for family. It starts out with these intentions at heart, but suddenly boom, his wife's out of the story and never mentioned again. He doesn't even rail against the corporation's demands, he just accepts it and moves on? A huge emotional core of his character was ignored, and therefore his character is at a narrative stand still.Effects wise, it is very impressive. The title may be RoboCop 2 by default, but in fact the new replacement robot in the film is called by name ""RoboCop 2"" (it is a little perplexing to hear repeated so often) and the action sequences in the final act are very well made with good stop-motion animation. As if calling the film's name and number was weird enough... the attempts to replicate Paul Verhoeven's satire and humour dies a lousy death. There's something about Verhoeven films that cannot be easily replicated, and this is a good example. The satire here is just... odd and unorthodox, often raising an eyebrow rather than a laugh. Why was there a shrine to Elvis in the villain's lair that included a skeleton of Elvis??It isn't bad, but it is missing all of the opportunities laid out by the first film. While there are memorable moments (RoboCop being dismantled, the criminal kid Hob using his right as a minor to avoid arrest, etc) they don't amount to enough for a full feature, and the end fight sequence becomes a little tiresome.",RoboCop 2

The third and severely underrated Robocop 3 was ten times better. The major problem with Robocop 2 is it doesn't have a direct plot, well at least with all those disjointed action scenes I didn't much care what was going on because there was nothing to combine them. I can't imagine anybody like me who loved the original will enjoy this. The reviews claiming it's underrated, are simply overrating it but still you can check this out for yourself to see how bad it is. Do yourself a favor and avoid! Highly disappointing!",RoboCop 2
123,The Bronson Fan,"Great special effects, a worthy sequel to a great movie.",10,14 June 2004,"One of the better sequels I have seen to a great movie, Robocop 2 is a great sci fi movie. Robocop 2 takes place not to long after Robocop with most of the police on strike, the city addicted a to new drug called nuke and OCP trying to buy out what's left of the police force and then city for there own corrupt corporate schemes. Robocop's main enemy in this one is a deranged hippie (aren't they all) Cain (Tom Noonan), who is the leader of a gang who uses a drug called nuke to make money and control the underworld of crime. Robocop in typical great violent fashion takes out most of the scum, but ends up being dismembered by the gang. Robocop is repaired, but the female corporate villain, Dr. Faxx (Bauer) of course wants to hinder his ability while she works on her own project: Robocop 2. In a great moment in the movie a bunch of ""men"" and soccer mom types give there opinions on how Robocop should be reprogramed, to be a typical politically correct wimp, think Al Gore and Tipper programing someone. ""Talk things out rather then waving that big gun of his."" Hahahahha! This obviously fails, Robocop fry's his circuits and goes back to nail Cain and the gang. Cain's brain is taken by Dr. Faxx for the new Robocop 2. Well eventually Robocop faces Cain now in a new body in a great climatic battle in Detroit that ends with his brain smashed all over the ground.Overall a great movie. The special effects I cant emphasize enough are incredible. How did we go from this to the CGI crap that is so popular now? The stop motion and models are amazing. Not flat as with most of even the most high tech CGI that's out there. To bad it so much money to do that now. The story is OK, I don't think it was as good as part ones, but the edition of the Robocop 2 is a great machine that is well worth the wait. Cain the villain I was not real impressed with. Clarence Boddicker from part one was much better. Look out for Ed Lauter with his stupid outfit, always the man. The action keeps up and you are never board, along with a fair amount of extreme violence although not as bad as I had thought when I saw it as a kid in the movie theaters. Maybe a bit tame by today. As with the first movie watch for all the great in jokes about corporate greed, the future (skin lotion commercial) are all funny. Like OCP's Flag? Some familiar characters return including The Old Man and Nancy Allen returning as Anne Lewis as the strong female role that works. There not much to say about Peter Weller, he walks around in his costume most of the time, nuff said. One and 2 are great movies however skip the stupid part three that was obviously taken over by a bunch of soccer Mom losers who ruined it. Overall the story is a little weak, but Robocop 2 gets a 10 out of 10 stars great sci fi action movie. See it just for the special effects if nothing else.",RoboCop 2
124,chrisow,"Whoops, what a disappointment",6,29 July 2002,"----Possible Spoilers----One year has passed since Alex Murphy (Robocop) wiped the likes of Clarance Boddiker and his gang off the face of the planet. However, the police strike is continuing, and a new breed of criminal is developing on the streets: an army of drug abusers, clinging for a fix of Old Detroit's new narcotic, Nuke. Their leader, Cain, has declared war on the city. Meanwhile, O.C.P plan to take Murphy off line and replace him with a new cyborg: Robocop 2.This sequel to the 1987 smash hit has potential, but squanders it for full on action. While there is nothing wrong with this, the original had a social commentary and satire to back it up. Frank Miller, the genius writer behind the masterpiece comic books Batman:The Dark Knight Returns and Ronin, gives the audience his bleak outlook of modern life in his first movie script. Apparently, the script was altered to include more action scenes, which explains certain plot holes. Hob, the ten year old kid, is a little b******. He deserves everything he gets in the end. Full credit to Gabriel Damon for giving the character this edge. However, the fact that the Nuke gang are able to easily dismantle Murphy sickens me. Seeing a childhood hero being cut apart with a jackhammer and a saw is degrading for him, especially after dispensing justice in the original. Also, the idea to reprogram Murphy as a P.C cop is also nausea inducing, seeing your hero dragged through the mud. Prehaps this is why the fans didn't embrace it.The main point of contention is that it feels like O.C.P tried to make a Robocop movie. It's mostly action, and tries to give it the little touches that made the original work, but it's mostly lip service. The action is well staged, during the nineties it held a record as the film with the second highest body count, but doesn't drag the viewer in enough. If Orion had allowed Paul Verhoeven, Ed Neuminer and Michael Miner to make their own sequel, then who knows. However, Verhoeven is (allegedly)working on a sequel, so fingers crossed.I give Robocop 2 a 6 out of 10. (Despite my ranting, it's not a bad film to watch if nothing's on. Just don't expect the original.)",RoboCop 2
125,killbill_28,Great Sequel,7,28 June 2006,"Many fans of the first Robocop film would not be disappointed with this entry of the trilogy. Robocop 2 is about Robocop trying to stop a massive drug lord named Cain (Which becomes Robocop 2). Frank Miller's story of Robocop was heavily rewritten during production but its still a great story. This one is just as violent as the first and contains a lot more swearing then the first movie. Peter Weller does a great job returning as Robocop, (he's best person for the job). Nacey Allen is great returning as Ann Lewis, Robocop's partner and sick-kick. Tom Noonan plays the drug lord and ruthless killer Cain.The special effects in this movie are great and sometimes a bit better then the first movie. Irvin Kershner takes over the director's chair from Paul Verhoeven (another great director) and directs and puts the movie together well. The Robocop movies were hard to make and sometimes people called it impossible. Another great thing about this movie is great cyborg fight between Robocop and Robocop 2. (Robocop 2 is like 10 times bigger then Robocop) at the end of movie. This movie full of gory violence, frequent swearing and drug use, but come on Robocop movies were meant to be this way and they work great like this.

126,bbjzilla,A gain again.,5,10 February 2021,"A lot has been made and written of Robocop 2s failures so in true meta style I'm going to follow that with more of the same which can be digested, ignored and compared to why popping your cherry the second time is never as good as the first.Along with the remake, R2 acknowledges the psychological impact of becoming a cyborg, but that's what the first movie was about; the existential horror of finding out you are not who you are. The tone was horrific, while disrespectful to the tenets of modernity; corporate greed, political angst and media scorn.R2 takes those tropes and softens them, the unease is diluted into cheap laughs, the villains become twirling mustachios, the violence and plot cartoon and inconsequential. Even the movies meta plotting allows it to be self referential; Robocop's committee programming rendering him impotent, his armour looks lightweight and easily disassembled, the main antagonist a ""superior"" (ie bigger more explosive) sequel literally named Robocop 2. As with the plot, its's clever but ultimately self defeating.Like an alcohol free beer, it probably won't do you any harm and it tastes the same, but just don't ask why you're not enjoying it or getting drunk.",RoboCop 2

Although it's perhaps not as memorable as the first film but it does try to be as good I guess.Not too bad I say.",RoboCop 2
128,mrphantasm,Well developed sequel.,8,3 April 2005,"RoboCop 2 had to carry the weight of been a sequel of an immediate classic. The original Robo was such a surprise and a success that spawned two reactions. 1. The producers felt it was necessary a sequel due the success of the Verhoeven's movie. 2. RoboCop became a cultural icon and a cult movie, with lots of fans. All that left a difficult task to new director. Hopefully this sequel turned out great. And this wasn't at all the standard is those days.A list of the good stuff of this film will be too large, that's probably the best compliment a movie could receive. It was a good detail that many of the original cast (the surviving characters, obviously) were present once again plus the addition on new characters. In this case Robo has not new allies just new enemies. Enemies like Cain that has some bizarre characteristics that put them side by side with the semblance of villains of comics, they are nasty but deeply emotional people, and some just misguided like Hob (it is worthy check out those biblical references).Irvin Kershner is a director who knows how to make good sequels, he proved himself in The Empire Strikes Back. Frank Miller along (co-writer) W. Green had clear in their minds what made Robocop the success it was. Violence, irony, social commentary, clever dialogue all that is present here again, yes but it's all a bit less intense, anyway to beat the quality of the first movie it would be necessary the presence of Verhoeven, Miner and Neumeier. But the new creators had respect towards their predecessors and started to build the new story using the previous material. If that's not enough there are lots of incredible action scenes, great even to the standards of today. Everything is tied by the solid thread of a great script. These are the reasons that made RoboCop 2 a great predecessor of the first installment of the saga. If RoboCop 2 would be the only sequel of the original Robo, many things would be different; maybe more people would dig more this second part. It would be nice if people made clear differences between this movie and Robocop 3. At least among all the negativity the future of the two first movies seem brighter than the diet-future of RoboCop 3.",RoboCop 2

It's not as violent as the first especially when you factor in the directors cut, but the sci-fi action/Cain robot is super awesome. There is some silliness tossed in which again fits with the narrative of PC and ""what about the children"" agenda that has been going on since the 90s. Overall, it's a solid film and never deserved the hate it got when it came out but I'm glad it has received more love over the years.",RoboCop 2
130,gressman07,Really?,9,25 December 2014,"I'm seeing ratings of 1/10 for this and am just baffled. Sure, this sequel is different from the original, which is, IMO, an amazing action/sci-fi/film in general. Sure, there are a lot of subplots and some points which definitely don't sync up (the ""nice"" Robocop subplot was humorous enough, but ultimately out of place with the rest of it and seemed only there to give the cops a reason to unify/come back). But there is still so much to enjoy. The opening/humor/action/homage to Veerhoven's violence and gore/villain/EPIC finale fight = all these things were great and worked in themselves, but I can see how they don't necessarily fit together due to all the various subplots and misdirections (the wife, the seeing his son in villain Home Alone boy, etc.). So a perfect film? No, but still an enjoyable sequel to a fantastic film, and one which syncs oddly enough with it considering it is a different director (owing largely to purposeful imitation of the commercials, satire, excessive gore, etc.) A 9/10 for me, minus 1 for what I interpreted as a not entirely synced up script and un-pursued subplots which might have been better removed to make for a tighter film or make room for more pertinent substance.",RoboCop 2
131,Eightiesjunkie,"Not quite as good as the first, but still incredibly entertaining!",8,12 June 2014,"After the massive success of RoboCop, a sequel was immediately rushed into production. The first script written by the original film's screenwriters was thrown out by Orion pictures for being too far-fetched. So the producer of the first film then contacted famed graphic novelist Frank Miller, to write the screenplay. Miller agreed, and wrote a first draft. The studio declared Miller's screenplay ""unfilmable"", so another screenwriter was brought in to rewrite the script. Some of the main cast members from the original film reprise their roles, this includes Peter Weller as RoboCop, and Nancy Allen as Officer Anne Lewis. The film takes place about a year after the first, and things have only gotten worse for the motor city. The majority of the police force have gone on strike. Ergo, crime is at an all-time high. A new designer drug known as ""Nuke"" has made a large number of citizens become drug addicts, and an almost cult-like group, are responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of this narcotic. They're leader is a man named Cain, a dangerous individual, whose soul desire is to use the drug to create a perfect society. He will stop at nothing to achieve his ultimate goal, and will not let anyone or anything get in his way. Meanwhile, OCP has seen how despotic and destitute the city has become, and has decided to create a second RoboCop. A monstrous, super cyborg is created, and soon it grows beyond the control of OCP. Now it's up to RoboCop to destroy this evil creation, and once again protect the innocent citizens of Detroit. So how does RoboCop 2 stack up? In my opinion, pretty well. All of the things that made the original film great are still there. The violence, the satire, the humor, and the issue of RoboCop's humanity. Even though it's not explored as deeply as in the original, it's still there. Many critics complained that the use of children swearing, and being drug dealers was too mean spirited. However the sad truth is, there are children like that in this world. Besides, wouldn't you expect to see that in a city that's gone to the dogs? There were many things that were left on the cutting room floor that shouldn't have been, and perhaps Robocop 2 could've have been better that it was. All things considered however, RoboCop 2 is STILL a very good and entertaining film. The acting is great, and there's more than enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat. If you ask me, this film does not deserve ANY of the hatred it receives! Watch it, and decide for yourself.",RoboCop 2
132,averjee,Far cry from the Original,5,13 January 2001,"This film lacks the easy mix of dark humor and violence that made the original such a treat. It's clearly a darker and more violent film than the first - more grusesome, with more space between funny lines of dialogue. Interestingly, director Irvin Kershner was accused of doing the same thing in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and that didn't bother me.   What makes this film fail is it's patent unbelievability. For example, after the initial success of the original model, one prototype RoboCop after another self-destructs. They get suicidal, according to scientists in the movie, because they lack a strong sense of duty. Why exactly a strong sense of duty creates a survival instinct is unclear.   The new Robocop is all machine, no humanity - basically, a robot. Which begs the question: why build it on a human frame at all? And why do they decide to turn Cain, the drug dealer, into a robot? This like the mad scientist in FRANKENSTEIN using a diseased brain to anumate his creature, only worse, because he doesn't need a brain at all.   The final sequence begins when they bring an armed Robocop II creature into a room ful of reporters, with no safeguards to shut him down. The concluding passages of the movie expend untold thousands of machine-gun bullets, most of them fired at the bad robot despite the fact that it's manifestly impervious to bullets. And so on.   Finally, we see relatively little of RoboCop in this movie, perhaps because Peter Weller rebelled against the inhuman ordeal of wearing that heavy metal suit any longer than necessary. What we do see are lots of violence and action, lots of dialogue between minor characters that never pays off, and lots of humorous TV ads for the world of the future. That, too, is a problem here - little drives the film or holds it together, and the tender, patient character development of the first film is totally missing.",RoboCop 2

My dad showed me a couple clips of the film on t.v. when I was a kid and I really had high hopes for this film. But unfortunately, I was greeted with a bunch of unneeded, unnecessary, brutal graphic storyline with a sad excuse for a storyline that might as well been three words: Bang, Bang, Bang. That isn't to say there isn't some fun to be had with this movie. The film tries very hard to be as action-packed as the original which it successfully achieves but unfortunately it's just so pointless that you grow irritated by it and begin to feel dirty from watching it. The visual effects are also a good factor for this film, it has extremely well done animation (Both stop-motion and surprisingly, a very early CGI that looks great for a 90's film). Nevertheless Robocop 2 isn't worth your time, just watch the original and stop.",RoboCop 2
134,crazychap,"Gloomy and violent, but also very entertaining",6,30 March 2008,"The $15 million 1987 original was such a great movie; yes it was ultra-violent, but it had a great charm to it that is unmatched by movies with bigger budgets and less violence. The special effects were mind-boggling (Robo's first-person view and the ED-209 stop-motion, to name a few), the characters were believable, and the storyline was very consistent. Its success encouraged Orion to persuade Verhoeven to film a sequel. However, scheduling conflicts prevented Verhoeven from returning to the director's chair (he was busy with Total Recall) and is replaced by Irvin Kershner, the director of the Empire Strikes Back,the best Star wars film.Set several years after the original, the crime epidemic seems to be worsening in Old Detroit, and, this time, OCP is actually stirring it up for its own ends as they encouraged the cops to go back on strike. The Old Man (Daniel O' Herlihy) makes a drastic change from a seemingly innocent, ambiguous but well-intentioned CEO to a ruthless, cold-blooded corporation tsar getting involved into politics and putting coercive pressure on the mayor to pay back his debts. While Robocop is fighting crime, OCP is grooming for a replacement. After a number of unmitigated (and humorous) disasters worth a total of $90 million, a corrupt psychologist-businesswoman named Juliette Fax (Belinda Bauer) steps in and convinces him to keep investing in the Robocop 2 project. Meanwhile, Robocop faces a criminal force that proves to be even more ruthless than the late Clarence Boddicker's gang, the psychotic ""hippie"" called Cain, whose clique is renown for creating a highly addictive and popular drug called ""Nuke"". Ironically, it would be Cain who becomes Robocop 2 following his hospitalisation from a police raid led by Robocop. Robocop 2 proves to be much bulkier and better-equipped than ED-209, Robocop's past nemesis.Robocop 2 proves to be a surprisingly good sequel. It does not intend to rehash the original story, and that is a strong point for sequels, who are often merely part I with different characters. The special effects are still spectacular and more detailed thanks to a bigger budget. Robocop 2's stop-motion animation is amazing, and the action sequences are well-staged and imaginative. The movie does have a lot of funny moments made from the faux commercials, the malfunctioning Robocop 2 prototypes and Robo's one-liners. The two leads are still likable now like they were in the original. Leonard Rosemnam's uplifting traditional music score makes a great replacement to Basil Polerdouris's gloomier, often-synthesised one, and the Robocop 2 theme is the high water mark of the saga. The downsides are: The screenplay has several unfinished ideas, in particular Robocop's human story at the beginning which is touched upon so lightly and ends only within the first 20 minutes of the movie. One particular scene which involves Duffy's brutal death is particular shocking to some viewers, but it's not as gruesome as Murphy's in the original. But the most criticised part of this film is including a foul-mouthed 12 or 13-year-old named Hob, a relentless, ruthless member of the gang. I find it excessive, but the movie shows a real aspect of crime: it knows no age boundaries.Although Verhoeven left the building, the project was still in good hands with Kershner as most of his trademarks are preservered here to good effect. Love it or hate it, Robocop 2 is a good, under-appreciated sequel that suffered a lot of unnecessary script changes.",RoboCop 2
135,kargaan,Good sequel just not good enough,8,22 July 2010,It's hard to top the first RoboCop. RoboCop is what I consider a cinema masterpiece. RoboCop 2 is not as good as the first of course but for what it is it is an overall good sequel. The story takes place after RoboCop 1 and is about a drug lord named Kane and an insane female scientist who tries to alter RoboCop's Prime Directives. The best parts of the movie are undoubtedly the parts that include RoboCop. The other scenes without Weller(RoboCop) are just weak and sort of depressing. The Story in this film is also weak and just doesn't top the story of the first. Despite the weak story the action and special effects are solid and well done which gives this movie a good re-watchable quality. To sum it all up if your a fan of the first then you will probably be impressed with the sequel just don't expect to have your mind blown.,RoboCop 2
136,Alan One,It doesn't get much worse than this. . .,1,3 December 1999,"Robocop 2 sure looks good on paper: Irvin Kershner directing, whose Empire Strikes Back gets as many votes as the others for best in the Star Wars series, and Frank Miller writing, the comic book writer/artist whose Batman revisions sparked a renaissance in the genre in the late 1980s. Additionally, both are working from the surprisingly entertaining premise of the original Robocop, in which a deceased cop is resurrected as a law-and-order killing machine with identity problems.The sequel is all but unrecognizable, with hardly two enjoyable minutes to be found in the entirity of this gritty, spiteful film.  The plot is something about drugs, pre-pubescent crime lords, and a brain transplant into a giant killer robot, but none of it is very memorable. The original was full of hammy acting and over-the-top action, but dipped into realism (the threatened police strike, Robocop's ghostly memories of his former life) enough to keep it grounded.  The striking police officers in the sequel are little more than cardboard cut-outs, and a scene were Robo confronts his ""wife"" is executed so lamely as to be downright insulting.Things look up when PR-minded execs decide to reprogram Robo with more PC directives and he winds up taking potshots at smokers.  It's a nice 30 seconds, but the resolution (Robo sticks a high-voltage cable down his chassis) is so simple-minded that he might as well have erased our memory along with his.

RoboCop 2 on the other hand is a deeply grotesque experience that does well in portraying a completely degenerate vision of the future but leaves a nasty taste in the mouth because of its sheer gratuitous, exploitative tone. This is also a very cold, hollow film, very incompetent too, with cheap shots at satire and a thoroughly illogical and dumb script. Certain characters from the original are so different emotionally and in their behaviour that the film bears little relation to the original (i.e, it reeks of cash-in). And why, why, would they put the brain of a dangerous psychopath in a police cyborg? Why? It is so ridiculously insulting and contrived for a spectacular final battle at the end that I was offended that this film was only allowed to be seen by 18 year olds in the UK, when its real target audience would be a very undemanding, warped child. There seems to be no joy of storytelling here, no drive or emotion, just a soulless (which makes the violence even more unpleasant and gratuitous) empty machine of a movie with false attempts at wit to try and appease fans of the original and violence to appeal to the underage kids who sneak in. A slice of garbage from probably Hollywood's worst ever period (sequels, sequels, Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts vehicles, plus more sequels). Still, if this sort of stupid (and this film really is stupid) garbage gets your rocks off, you're welcome to it.",RoboCop 2
139,owen-47103,Dead Man Shooting (alot),5,8 April 2019,"Given its status as one of the most highly regarded, popular and enduring sci-fi/action pictures of the 80's, it's truly surprising how bad all the sequels to and spinoffs from (including the recent remake) Paul Verhoeven's original RoboCop (1987) turned out to be. Like the original Jaws (1974) or The Crow (1994), the reputation of the first picture has been heavily tarnished by the series it inspired, and the charactistics that defined the original's quality are almost universally lacking from any of the (almost universally dire) subsequent pictures.This, the first direct sequel, and the only follow-up entry to feature Peter Weller in the title role, is by far the best of a very bad bunch, but nonetheless manages to trash much of what was enjoyable about the first picture for the sake of a conventional, ultra violent shoot-em-up, laced with crude sadism and a heavy-handed conservative anti-drugs message.Gone is the sly, lightly satirical tone of the original, replaced with an almost misanthropic cynicism. Also missing is Basil Poldouris's iconic score, replaced with a braying, brassy accompaniment that hampers more than it inhances. Likewise absent is the first film's note of humanising sentiment, or any sense of ambiguity around its (essentially fascist) moral structure. In this film's reduced vision, Weller's RoboCop is an unreconstructed, summary-justice-dispensing human tank, who's gruesomely inventive executions of cartoonish villains we, the audience, are openly invited to cheer (thus becoming largely indistinguishable from numerous, dubious 80's action heroes as portrayed by Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Norris et al). While the original film essentially parodied such simplistic ideas of justice or law enforcement, this film offers them up wholesale, devoid of any intent other than eliciting crude excitement or sado-masochistic glee.Plot-wise, it's a straight-forward continuation of the first film; a bankrupt ""Old Detroit"", beset by a prolonged police strike and plagued by a new, super-addictive designer drug called Nuke, is on the brink of a hostile takeover by amoral super-corporation OCP. RoboCop is one of the few officers still on the beat, and apparently divides his time between stylised, bloody nightime shoot-outs in narcotics factories with longingly driving by his former wife's new house in the (surprisingly peaceful) suburbs. The chief antagonist this time out is the psychopathically twisted gang-leader behind the manufacture and sale of Nuke, the permanently spaced out Cain (portrayed as a kind of diabolical old hippie by Tom Noonan). Meanwhile OCP, seeking to capitalise on the police union action to promote a new line of improved RoboCops, find their efforts stymied (in a darkly funny sequence) by a string of failed prototypes that keep committing suicide.Superficially, there's nothing acutely wrong with the setup, and generally speaking there's just about enough of the original's humour, style and hard-edged action to drive the thin narrative forward. The special effects remain impressive for the time, and Weller's protagonist is still an effectively tragic figure, his bouts of callous murder and maiming notwithstanding. Where it really falls down, however, is in its disjointed narrative, dramatically unfocused storytelling, bleak outlook and lack of a coherent message. The threads of RoboCop's internal struggle established in the early scenes are completely discarded once the film gets down to it's real business (of delivering brutally violent action thrills), and the satirical elements are reduced to a few clever but inconsequential television inserts, mostly copied from the first picture. Cain is never more than a two-dimensional baddie, and his cohort - including a conspicuously hot Spanish señorita and a murderous, slick-haired tyke who takes over his drug empire - smacks of cynical controversy-bait. The plot convolutions required to shoe-horn Cain's brain into the corporation's new, bigger, badder cyborg (and thus set up the final act of the film) are so tortuous as to be laughable, and the ending is a damp squib, with the ultimate villians at the top of OCP apparently escaping clean.And yet, for all those screeching flaws, it somehow manages not to be completely without merit. While director Irvin Kershner's grasp of human drama may have an olive-oil coating, he proves that he's lost none of his touch for deftly choreographed action and judicious use of special-effects since The Empire Strikes Back (1981). Though some of the early shootouts are scrappy and aimless, the scenes with the new improved RoboCain deliver the goods, and Kershner displays an old-fashioned pro's sense of how much to show and how much to imply. While almost reduced to a supporting role in his own picture, RoboCop is still an entertaining figure, when either casually blowing a creep's brains out through the scope on his own rifle, or earnestly reading Miranda rights to a glassy-eyed corpse after a bout of reprogramming sends him haywire, and capable assistance from the supporting cast is available in the form of Dan O'Herlihy, Felton Perry and Nancy Allen.So while RoboCop 2 is undoubtedly a disappointment, its combination of bloody action, sick humour, morally dubious elements and slick, ambitious effects are just close enough to the original for it stand head-and-shoulders above any of the (increasingly childish) sequels, spinoffs, remakes and rehashes that followed it. If you absolutely must have another RoboCop in your life, this is by far the one to choose.",RoboCop 2
140,UprTupr,Possibly THE Worst Sequel of All Time,2,22 March 2001,"Nothing in this movie made sense.  OCP decides to take a perfectly good Robocop and overhaul his memory, thereby treating him as ""product"" when clearly ""The Old Man"" thought of him as a person at the end of the first movie.  Murphy's resolution with his family is far too brief, and some of the action is overly violent. My advice: Watch the first ten minutes and the last 10 minutes.  Trash everything in between.",RoboCop 2
141,vladthelad8666,"I keep seeing people hating on this, why?",8,28 July 2021,"I remember seeing Robocop 2 as a kid and I loved it, for some reason I haven't seen it since, but all this time I just kept hearing people trashing it without any good reason. So what did I do? Watched it, loved it again and shook my head at all the empty negative reviews people gave it. I really don't understand why this happens, same thing with Predator 2, amazing movie that tried something new and did rather successfuly in my humble opinion.Petter Weller returns as Alex Murphy/Robocop and he is just as entertaining as before. I can agree we could have seen more of the story arc involving his wife, but the bits we saw show just how strong he clings on to his humanity, despite being constantly told he is just a machine. Honestly. It's a cliche, but I just can't imagine anyone else playing the character. Nancy Allen returns as. Lewis, and she is just badass. She doesn't take crap from anyone. Maybe the only flaw is that her character is more in the background and this time, and someone forgot to think about developing her further.The effects are still really good, there's a good mix of practical and computer. I love the shot of the mechanized Cain, where he opens the door to the warehouse, and the camera stays on him for a couple of seconds. As for the violence, Robocop 2 is bloody. Maybe not as bloody as the first one, but it's still has its share amount of red juice. Maybe a tiny bit goofy approach to it, but that's alright.The plot isn't anything inovative, but it does paint the collapsing Detroit well, as it is a breeding ground for violence and drug abuse. While the evil organization OCP is planning on completely changing the infrastructure of Detroit, a drug cartel is developing a brand new drug called ""Nuke"", which they plan on distributing all over the city. And you know how Robocop hates crime, he is quickly up in their noses. OCP also plan on developind and manifacturing their own version of Robocop, which will later in the movie serve as the main antagonist. Corruption, greed and betrayal are the most prominent topics discussed in Robocop 2. It really doesn't stray that much further from the first movie.Robocop fans, don't sleep on this sequel. Everything that comes after is a sad excuse for a movie, but not this one. Yes, it's cheesy and goofy at times, but it's still a gritty sci-fi action flick, Definetly recommend it to everyone who enjoys the genre.",RoboCop 2

143,Maarten1985,The Final Chapter,6,5 September 2006,"ROBOCOP 2 starts only a few years after where ROBOCOP has left us. Crime rates have increased, a new drug called Nuke is gaining popularity, cops are on strike or corrupt and OCP is eager to take over control of the city. Only Robocop can save the day, and the city.The story of Robocop 2 is darker and more violent than the first movie, which means more action. And that's what you get, lots of shooting and killing. More than the original movie.With most movies more action means a weaker plot, but this isn't the case with Robocop 2. The story is still a pretty good one and the connection between the first and second movie makes sense in most cases.Most actors luckily reprised their roles. Robocop is Robocop because of the actors. The effect of 'how it is not done' can be seen in Robocop 3. Peter Weller feels more comfortable playing a Robot, but Nancy Allen seems to have had less screen time. Special notifications are for Tom Noonan, the disturbed Cain, and Damon Gabriel, professionally playing Hob at 14-years of age.A bit of a let down in this movie are the special effects and the large amount of clearly visible goofs. I was able to see about 4-5 goofs in a single scene, and I'm usually not good at seeing goofs. The special effects, the stop-motion-recording or whatever its called, looks a bit outdated and too cheap.Overall, ROBOCOP 2 is a decent action flick, underrated by many, that follows nicely into the footsteps of the original ROBOCOP movie. For most people, this movie marks the final chapter of the Robocop-movies as the next one (Robocop 3) no longer features Peter Weller.My score would be a 6/10 or 6.5/10",RoboCop 2
144,maple_leafs_kickass,"""Cain! Lets Step Outside!""",8,9 October 2006,"Robocop 2, following it's masterful first was I think, way too critically panned. Yes, it isn't as good as the first, but it ain't bad. Irvin Kershner assumes the directing duties taking over where Verhoeven left off and while Kershner did not pull off that razor sharp style and wit that Verhoeven so terrifically accomplished he still managed to pull off a fun flick starring our clunky hero.Kershner really gave Robocop a different feel in comparison to the first, which while focusing on action in particular, also gives a great emotional feel, the feeling of loss and the feeling of revenge seering through ones veins. Murhpy's wife and son were brought into perspective in the first Robocop but in this sequel, they are really forgotten after the first 15 minutes due to the fact that OCP wants him to forget about the fact that he ever was Alex Murphy and concentrate on solely what he was built for. So this movie has somewhat of an absence emotionally at times and really concentrates more on the loud torcherous violence, making it supremely entertaining on the happy note. Peter Weller thankfully reprises his role as Murphy and just as in the first was great, he really gives the character a great zing, with his deep metallic voice, something that all the other actors to have portrayed Robocop have lacked and just don't seem believable in anyway, but it's not only that, Weller can make the character real and life like. He can make something that seems so unreal and unhumanlike and turn it into one of us, without doubt he's the best Murphy out there.The story in this sequel is simple, a new drug is sweeping the country called Nuke, highly addictive and it's up to Murphy to put a stop to it but after a run in with the Nuke Lord Cain (played by Tom Noonan)has him dissembled(a really hard scene to watch to warn fans out there), there's consideration as to replacing Murphy in which he eventually does though he gets rebuilt. Using the brain of Nuke Lord Cain (after the 2nd run in with Murphy) they reconstruct a ""Robocop 2"". But Cain knows who he is still and the killing starts. The best part of the movie, Robocop and Cain squaring off. Golden scene setting the stage.A great sci-fi actioner that didn't get enough respect. I know it could have been better, perhaps had they used Frank Miller's original script, which was deemed unfilmable at the time, it would have been something better.Well one way or the other, give this underrated classic a shot.""Good Bye""",RoboCop 2

Oh did I mention they use a drug-addicted ex-con (who also played the bad guy in The Last Action hero so you KNOW he's good!) to be the second project? WHY? Ask Frank cause any rational person would say this was a bad idea. Makes me long for the day when Red Forman was shooting holes in Robocop. Can You believe they made 3????? After this sludge?

In their haste, they forgot to include the humanity that the first film had, not going further into the personality of Officer Murphy, his relationship with his partner and the police force, instead just going for violent action sequences. A little more camp humor is injected into this sequel, making it amusing in places where it shouldn't have been. RoboCop is chasing down the dealer of a new narcotic, ""Nuke"" while he is being undermined by the company who produced him, who wants to produce a more efficient, controllable model. The film almost has two endings, as he does take down the dealer (Tom Noonan), but the dealer's brain and nervous system is installed into another cyborg, forcing another showdown with RoboCop.

Loads of kids hanging about at night on a ""school day""? Check.

Peter Weller makes it watchable but the idiots that jettisoned Frank Miller's story and script shouldn't be in the business of green lighting movies. Millers story is dragged kicking and screaming across two bad movies but make one brilliant graphic novel.
If this was Greenlit now under a huge name like Frank Miller it would have zero rewrites because comics seem to be bankable now under the people who actually wrote them.

There is fantastic stop-motion animation of one cyborg and you will probably like seeing Robocop himself in various stages of disintegration.It doesn't get more ""cyborgy"", visually, than this!The other thing that I liked is that on one of my all-time favorite albums, ""Tactical Neural Implant"" by Front Line Assembly, there are many audio samples from Robocop 2 thrown into the music ... which is much better than the film, but those samples fit the bio-mechanoid atmosphere of FLA's tunes just perfectly and the album wouldn't be the same without them!5/10",RoboCop 2

164,GabeShadow,"Jeez, no wonder Frank Miller was disgusted with Hollywood during the 1990s",5,2 February 2006,"Normally, sequels make the franchise better, but unfortunately, this is not the case for the Robocop series. In 1987, a movie Robocop was created, which was directed by Paul Verhoven and the writers were Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner. What made Robocop stand out was that it was one of the best sci-fi movies of its time. The story was down-to-earth, and the principal cast was likable.Now, enter Robocop 2, which gave a number of mixed reviews and both sides had their valid points.Story: 5/10 (due to the cut material set by Kirshner). This movie chronologically takes place a year after Robocop was placed on active duty. Robocop and Lewis(Peter Weller and Nancy Allen reprising their roles) fight a drug lord (played by Tom Noonan.) who designed the drug ""Nuke."" The story on-screen felt like there was barely any material the director could come up with. Truth is, Frank Miller had more story material written on paper, but unfortunately, Irvin Kershner made the god-forsaken mistake to cut out bits and pieces of Frank's vision. The only thing left is the over-the-top violence, and ""Robocop 2"" which is the sad truth.Both interviews with Peter Weller and Nancy Allen had one thing in common. There were things missing what made the first movie good, such as moments of crucial character development. I was surprised that Weller didn't want to do Robocop 3, and he made a good decision. The sasd fact is that out of the cut material given, they involved Robocop's humanity.The only way to access those cut material is either a Director's Cut DVD or checking out the comic books. Just watching the movie by itself is reduced to a clichéd ""Let's kick ass"" movie. Entertaining, yes, but it just suffered a lot. The subplots making Robocop a complete hippy pacifist, and the Murphy family were badly depicted in the movie. Robocop's pacifist demeanor was laughably bad during both scenes involving children. I don't know how Peter Weller felt when doing that scene, but I felt sorry for the guy agreeing to a scene like this. The Murphy family subplot was resolved *VERY* badly. I felt like throwing up when Robocop was forced to not be himself in front of his wife, and he just stood there like an idiot while watching his wife talk with an OCP-hired lawyer.Sound: 8/10 The guns sounded like they are supposed to. The music however was a bit too up-beat for some tastes. Robocop was depicted to be a hero who struggles with the way he is in the first movie, but Robocop 2's soundtrack made him look like a freaking action hero from the 1960s version of comic-book-based movies.Acting and character development: 6/10 (blamed on the cut material again): Weller did a good job with what he did for the movie, but what made him memorable just wasn't there during the sequel. The same thing went for Allen's portrayal of Lewis. The actors weren't to blame for this, but the direction Kirshner wanted for the movie.Overall: The movie is just average to mediocre. It's a big insult to Robocop fans including myself. I agree with the other reviewers to the fact that it was a rush job, that's all the movie was just so they could get fast cash despite the amount of effort given into the special effects for the battle between both Robocops.",RoboCop 2
165,giuseppelospalluti,Good and funny,10,28 April 2008,"Film sympathetic but nothing Almighty. One of many'80s films, very cheerful and ironic that ironizzava the saga of robocop. Film certainly for the family created specifically for the saga of movie about robots much in vogue in anni'80. The robots continue to pleasure, even though in reality do not have a well-known commercial use. One of the recent film about robots ""Trasformers"" has had some success even though the robotic charm is quite declined in recent years. The'80s were a period full of ideas even if the film fumettistici were lots and absurd. This film for this period was suimpatico.

166,APRI6ION,Uninspired and messy sequel.,4,10 September 2014,"Robocop does battle with a powerful drug lord who is transformed into a giant psychopathic cyborg, while simultaneously resisting OCP's attempts to repress his human memories.At first glance the woeful reviews for Robocop 2 might seem confusing, because everything seems to be in the right place, initially. The production values are fairly slick, the action scenes are shot with an enjoyable bloodthirstiness and there are some funny scenes early on, including some malfunctioning 'Robocop 2' prototypes and a couple of satirical commercials. I also like the scenes in which Robocop becomes an eccentric pacifist. But as the film clunks into the main story it starts to come apart and fast.There is absolutely no heart and no energy and one dull scene bumbles into the next like a drunkard trying to string a sentence together. The violence, which starts out cheerfully enough, eventually becomes quite nasty and sadistic. The graphic violence of the original film was used to great satirical effect and was often sardonically humorous, such as ED-209 blowing a company exec to bits at a board meeting, or it had a real point; Clarence Boddicker's biblical execution of Murphy. Here though the violence is just gratuitous, a bit weird and has absolutely nowhere to go - one particular scene comes to mind in which a child mobster is forced to watch the bodily dissection of a crooked cop. In fact the entire child villain thing was irritating and ludicrous from the jump, concluding in a scene in which Robocop takes pity on the little stinker. Don't make me laugh.Weller does everything he can to breath some life into his character and bags most of the funniest or most memorable moments, but like many things in this film I have no idea what Nancy Allen was doing the whole time, what a waste. She does nothing but point guns at people and frown; this only touches upon the many profound problems with the script and direction.In the end Robocop 2 doesn't just suffer from the absence of Verhoeven but also from an uneven script humming with unfinished ideas, narrative dead-ends and a serious lack of humour, doing nothing whatsoever to build upon its predecessor's greatness. I have to disagree with some of the more optimistic reviews here; this film isn't trying to do something different, it doesn't appear to know what it's trying to do at all.I will say this for it though, the stop motion effects were great and it is, at least, a better film than Robocop 3.4/10",RoboCop 2

It's a nasty, horrible and mean- spirited mess of a film that lacks a clear narrative and an interesting story. The acting is woeful, the musical score is disastrous and the script is nonsensical and witless. Peter Weller is completely lost and confused as the character he played in the first movie is so badly characterized that you'd think that this was a different RoboCop to the one we saw in the first movie. Even the brilliant Lewis character is nothing like she was in the original film. The direction lacks flair, style and identity; sometimes it feels like a TV movie that Channel FIVE show on weekday afternoons. Avoid RoboCop 2 like the plague.

Again cringe-worthy action with overly exaggerated atrocities and ridiculous actions of basically all the characters, again the unworked physics of the world. The pros are also repeated. Also between scenes we see commercials and news interludes describing a not-too-distant, dystopian future. Of the interesting moves, the already more obvious evil from the corporations and the impotence of official power, typical of cyberpunk, are worth mentioning. So all in all the film is pretty passable, even for people who liked the first Robocop. And the separate love of some weird jokes and ridiculous situations is at times simply hilarious.",RoboCop 2

It still wasn't as good as the original but it had some great effects and Peter Weller was still good in the title role of Robocop. Of course it's not a truly great film or artistic or anything, it is just a fun summer action movie with a lot of shooting and violence and funny one liners. Robocop 3 was truly terrible and that is what ruined the movie series in my mind, I think Robocop 2 is better than it gets credit for. I need ten lines so I will just write what my nephew says about Robocop now, ""Robocop is stupid but there are some cool parts I guess and his gun is a fine f***in weapon"", I agree with the weapon being cool but that is it.",RoboCop 2
177,christianvillagomez,Oh while I probably would've paid to see this in theaters back then if I was around...,7,13 June 2010,"... There were a few specific flaws that prevented this decent sequel from being up to par with its brilliant sequel. Now first I'll mention what I liked about this movie: the action and visual effects are still very well-crafted if not better, and say what you will about how Irvin Kershner handled this movie but you gotta admit he did a near flawless job at capturing Future Detroit in the daytime. And now, viewers beware some of these notes for they can count as spoilers, here is every single detail I think could've strongly been avoided but alas wasn't that doomed the movie to not going beyond an ""alright"" to me: * In the beginning part they shouldn't have did that idea of crook after crook stealing from each other * The gun robber should've just nailed Robocop's car 1 time instead because dammit while Murphy can't go down easily he's still no freaking superman! * Irvin shouldn't have made Peter Weller's motivation for being RoboCop be that he still talks robotic cause all us fellow fans are aware of how Murphy regained his human personality and voice back in the end of the 1st film * At the very least the character Hob should've looked 16 and not 12 * I liked the Magnavolt commercial at the beginning but damn they should've just cut the horrifically corny ad for that really powerful sunblock * Filmmakers needed to have that small 5 minute subplot of Murphy's last ties with his family get stretched to like 15 minutes which dragged throughout the whole movie * Biggest beef I had was towards Frank Miller (writer of this movie) was him practically turning the Sweet Old Man in to a Senile Old Bastard * This movie really shouldn't have been a part 1 to the very crappy part 2 that was RoboCop 3, it really should've been its own story and in the end OCP needed to have just get what they deserved or at the very least the character Juliette Faxx (who, for better or worse, was portrayed great by Belinda Bauer)There, those were all the things that kept RoboCop 2 from being one of the most perfect sequels ever in my book. Hope you can side with me on that part.",RoboCop 2
178,nicholascamerontaylor,Somewhere in this lack luster sequel is a good movie desperately trying to claw it's way out.,3,18 July 2014,"Having watched Robocop (1987) and having found it a thoroughly entertaining roller coaster of a ride I was eagerly anticipating the opportunity to see the 1990 sequel. Seeing many of the original cast reprise their roles as well as what on the surface appeared some very good recasting I plunged into Robocop 2 with gleeful abandon only to be quickly brought back down to earth. To call myself disappointed is a gross understatement, I was distraught, devastated, my mind frantically tried to delete any recollection of this film from my memory. But alas, no amount of effort on my brain's part could erase the torment I had just subjected myself to. Around the 23 minute mark was when the penny finally dropped that there was a distinct possibility that I would derive little enjoyment from this film. The opening segment and our reintroduction to Robocop showed some promise, they teased us with the idea of further exploring Robocop's humanity, to look at the man in the machine and what it is in Alex Murphy specifically that makes him the best ""man"" for the job and the question of whether he is a man or merely a machine... but the movie never delivers. All the charm of the original is saturated in order to mash as many forgettable and foolish villains imaginable into this mess of a film. In order to appreciate how truly painful this movie is at times you really have to experience it for yourself but I do feel like I should stress that this film should come with a warning, because you may have to call a helpline afterwards. As the more astute readers may have spotted I make reference in this reviews tagline that I believe somewhere in this train-wreck of a film is a good and worthy successor to Robocop desperately trying to worm its way out from the chains of mediocrity. Kain could have been an interesting foil to our titular hero but we are never given enough exposition of who he is and what it is that motivates him, the idea of an upgraded Robocop better than the original to pit against our hero is something we want but instead we are given ED-209 lite. They trick us into thinking we will be given a thought provoking action thriller but instead we are given a film that lacks both style and substance.And this is what makes Robocop 2 all the more infuriating, I want it to be good, I want it to live up to the first film, it knows that it wants to live up to its father and his intimidating shadow but unfortunately for us, the audience, paying our hard earned money, it fails to deliver.",RoboCop 2

181,pstevensondyolfknip,Oh dear,4,27 September 2007,"I was a huge fan of the original Robocop.But to say I was disappointed by this first sequel would be an understatement.The problems are many.Glossy though the film may look there are plenty of bloopers on screen for all to see, wires, cameramen etc, something I find wholly unacceptable from someone of Irvin Kreshner's pedigree.Robocop has become a robot. There is no spark of humanity to be found in the character here. A true disappointment when one considers that his ""soul"" had returned by the end of the first movie. Here his attitude shows no human side and makes him hard to sympathise with.Caine is a poor villain. OK I know Boddiker from the first film was better than the average, mainly thanks to Kurtwood Smith's performance, but the usually solid Tom Noonan creates a character who you couldn't care less about one way or the other.What's happened to the Old Man????. I appreciate that he didn't get to where he is by being ""nice"" but the change in his character here is nothing short of dumbfounding. In the first movie it's made clear he despises Dick Jone's tactics and attitude and yet here he's no better than Jones. It makes no sense.Doctor Faxx is a poor replacement for Bob Morton's charismatic, if unpleasant, OCP resident genius.The action sequences, save the sequence where Murphy is stuck to the side of Caine's truck, are harsh and nasty and repel rather than entertain.And finally. What is with the musical score?. Don't tell me Poledouris couldn't have done it simply because he was working on Total Recall at the time. A series (TV or Movie) soundtrack is part of its personality. Part of its character. When you remove that it harms the familiarity of the characters we're watching. So it's bad enough but shame on Leonard Rosenman. His score here is lurid, camp and downright cringe worthy.The story has its moments to be fair. There's a lot of originality in here. But it tries too many new things to take in with one film. Hob is a well realised villain and the only truly dis likable ""villian"" in the move, Thumbs up to Gabriel Damon there.The final showdown between Robocop and Robocop 2 is fun as well.But for the vast majority of its overlong running time this is a serious disappointment.",RoboCop 2
182,stevendeacy,Peter Weller's Nightmare,3,10 August 2001,"Unfortunately producers don't know when to leave well enough alone, or are into recycling to the point that every scrap of trash that Hollywood generates is up for rendering into Alpo.  It seems that every sci-fi action adventure flick must endure a sad list of follow-up films, and Robocop is a tragic example.  The first film, under Paul Verhoven's direction was a wild, stylish ride, even finding time for a little social commentary on what the dark side of bio-tech is capable of turning us into.  This film has none of that, aside from maybe telling us that drugs are bad for you and could make you do things you'd regret when sober.  Robocop 2 lacks the vision, the profoundly scary vision of what we are becoming, and instead clumsily takes us on a boat ride into how nauseating drug dealers and their victims really are.  Social commentary be damned.  This one really bit the big one for me. If you don't care for anything but the SFX, go to it, my friend.  Otherwise don't waste your time with this yeastless sour cake, and preserve the first film's accurately measured, heavy-weighted pumpernickle hot out of the oven. It's that simple.",RoboCop 2

184,cartastic,How come this one got waisted so easily?,10,6 June 2009,"I've always been a big fan of Robocop, an utter devotee of Verhoven's masterpiece and, unless it's part 1 or 2, I pretty much despise everything that's come out under the brand name Robocop. However, I'm surprised that so many people criticize Robo 2 for what it is. After all, we do get Peter Weller doing a great job in the suit, we do get some complex issues such as Murphy's attempt to return to his family life or, should I say, the devastating confession he decides to make to his wife. There's the new cyborg and what a cyborg he is! A cybernetic organism willing to cooperate under the condition they feed it with drugs. Cool. Obviously, the body-count remains high and action sequences are top notch. I truly do not understand the reason why the overall grade for this one is only 5,4. The only explanation I'm willing to accept is that, maybe the majority of voters here aren't really Robo fans, or have started their adventure with Robo from seeing the TV series or 3rd part which are both blasphemy and have nothing to do with part 1 and 2. If it were the case, please reconsider, grab a copy of genuine Robocop movies [1,2] and restate your opinions. Cheers:)",RoboCop 2
185,swgjaaax,Entertaining and thought-provoking,9,19 February 2015,"I believe there is much more depth to this film than is immediately apparent. This is not too surprising given Frank Miller's role. The ""Old Man"" seems to play the role of the biblical Adam. He wants to be the king of his domain. His consort, Dr. Faxx, plays the role of Eve. Together they create Cain. Cain, like in the Genesis story, is a killer. When things go wrong for the Old Man, he conveniently blames everything on ""Eve.""Cain also plays another role as a false Messiah. He has ""delusions of godhood"" and openly compares himself to Jesus Christ. He promises ""paradise"" in the form of the most addictive drug ever made. He also promises to make a young boy the heir to his kingdom. The boy follows in Cain's footsteps, seeking power and wealth. Ultimately, both Cain and the boy (Hobb) want power and control. Cain wants to control every emotion that he might ever experience. He offers this kind of control to the masses. Ironically, the promise of control leads to the slavery of addiction. The boy ends up dead, killed by Cain, surrounded by money that will do him no good.OCP also wants power and control. To get it, though, they must remove some obstacles. One is Robocop. They attempt to control his mind through nonsensical programming that leaves him conflicted. They also attempt to eradicate his humanity. The annihilation of what it means to be human is a prominent theme this story. Emotion, soul, community is destroyed by the machinery of greed and the lust for control.Robocop again plays the role of a Christ figure. He faces the false Messiah, is tortured, goes through hell, OCP attempts to render him powerless, but he overcomes the programming through an act of desperation--a gamble that risks his life, but leads to redemption.We then have his return to bring judgment on Cain, OCP, the Old Man, and his partners in crime. He is free of self-doubt, free of OCP's programming. His victory is incomplete, but he tells his partner (Lewis) to ""have patience, we're only human."" I've read that the violence in the film is simply mean-spirited and pointless. I don't believe this is true. It establishes the character of the false Messiah. Though he promises paradise, he is really looking for slaves and sychophants. When he is done with you, he'll torture you for pleasure and then watch you slowly die.I've also read that the character of Hobb only exists to encourage bad behavior in youth. I think this is truly inaccurate. Hobb is the child in each of us. Hobb is what this child looks like when corrupted by a false Messiah. There is a warning here against being duped by those who offer you the world on a silver platter. His innocence partially returns when he nears death and has a brief moment of clarity...too late. Robocop, again acting as a Christ figure, shows compassion to his former adversary--""forgive them for they know not what they do."" Once again there is some dark humor in this film, like the original. I think the original ""hit the mark"" a little better in this department, but not by much. The mayor is intentionally comical,but also represents democracy and the power of ""the people"" against corporate greed.I gave the film a 9, rather than a 10, because I'm aware of some of the difficulties encountered in its making. As good as it is, it could have been even better.I truly found this to be an entertaining film that also attempted to explore important themes related to human nature and the essence of what is truly good, and what is truly evil.I think it's underrated, and I believe some of the allegory is missed by those who perhaps aren't expecting to see it.",RoboCop 2
186,jeroenkeip,Terrible,3,11 May 2006,"This movie is a fine example of what happens when a studio wants to get a sequel to a fine movie out of the gates at all cost. Only with this movie, it truly is a near miss. Everything seems in place for Robocop 2 to be a worthy followup to the groundbreaking first movie. The complete original cast (apart from the casualties, naturally) returns and gives it their best. Too bad a hackneyed script and an incompetent director as good as neutralize their efforts.Irvin Kershner might have been the ideal go to guy for George Lucas to direct the Empire Strikes Back. For a pedestrian filmmaker like Kershner there isn't much to ruin in Lucas' charmless film series. A worthy successor to a classic like Robocop would have needed either Paul Verhoeven to return, or a director with enough brass to give his own spin on it. Kershner doesn't know how to give his own spin on anything (Lucas hired him for that) and he's surely no Verhoeven.So what we get here is a movie that goes through all the motions to replicate the first movie, but with none of the freshness, humor or daring the original had. Kershner probably thought he could top Verhoeven by adding more gore and gratuitous violence, but instead he reveals how much he was at work as a director for hire instead of a passionate filmmaker. And that's a shame, since everything was in place to make this another classic. As mentioned the actors give it their best, but Phill Tippet delivers some groundbreaking stop motion effects and there are some great ideas in the story by Frank Miller, who was born to write a Robocop movie. If only the studio had hired a director who was competent enough to make all the potential come through.",RoboCop 2
187,Master_Wayne,One Awesome Action-Packed Sequel.,8,24 November 2004,"Robocop 2 is a very amusing movie that is often times unfairly criticized. It is obviously not as good as the first film, but its still a darn good sequel. This movie, just like the first, always gets made fun of and I can't see why. I think these movies are just so entertaining. Here's my two cents.I am a huge fan of these Sci-Fi/Action movies, and Robocop is definitely one of the coolest in the genre. The first film is a classic, but most people don't seem too fond of it's sequel. Robocop 2 is dark, cruel, and gruesome, but it never misses it's chance to fit in a joke. The humor in this movie is just as good as the first's, if not better. The acting is a little poor at times, but you can't expect too much out of a film like this. Robocop 2's story is less diverting, but the special effects are superior to the first. This movie has a much better climax than the original, and the final moments of violence at the ending have some of the best special effects I have ever seen(without the use of cgi)in a movie.My problem is that people always accuse films like this of not being realistic enough. What should you expect from a title like 'Robocop 2""? People need to just sit back and suspend disbelief for a movie like this. The Robocop movies are pure bloody fun, that's all. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes violent 'machine vs. machine' warfare, and being a fan of the first movie couldn't hurt either.",RoboCop 2
188,docbonkerz,"This is actually a great flick, folks!!!!......",7,2 May 2006,"What makes a good movie? Plot? Characters? Action? Robocop 2 has all of these in boatloads.Imagine this: A large corporation, OCP, is headed by corrupt execs who want to take over the city. They get into business with the city, then pull the legs out from under it by letting the city's police force go unfunded. Now the police are on strike, the city is in a state of chaos, falls into debt, and OCP is ready to foreclose on the city and advance its plans. Robocop is still on the prowl, of course, and continues to hunt down a wealthy and powerful drug lord. Robocop is nearly killed in the process, but is soon repaired. A bright-eyed ambitious woman of questionable motives, Dr. Fax, wants to make a name for herself in OCP by choosing the brain of OCP's next cyborg. To clear the way for her plans, however, she must keep Robocop out of commission, and upon his repair she programs him with nonsense directives thus keeping him from being a cop. She's also sleeping with OCP's CEO, just to make sure.Robocop, recognizing his humanity and individuality, manages to erase the programming from his memory. Soon enough, with the help of the police force he convinces to go off of strike, Robocop nearly kills the drug lord. Nearly. Dr. Fax, however, murders the drug lord in his hospital bed and uses his brain in her ""Robocop 2"".Meanwhile, in an effort to save the city, the mayor tries to strike a deal with the drug-lord's second in command who promises to pay off the city's debt to OCP. The executives of OCP find out about this and send Robocop 2 to kill his former cohorts as well as the mayor during this transaction.....and the story goes from there.This is truly one of the most intricate, intertwined stories I've encountered in a very long time. I've seen movies with much simpler, much shallower plots win Oscars! Robocop 2 has plot, well-developed characters, spectacular action that is actually relevant to the story, and underlying social commentary to boot.So why in the world has this movie received such harsh criticism? Because it has the word ""Robocop"" in its name, and no movie with that kind of name will ever be given the credit it deserves.Robocop 2 is simply a great flick that should entertain viewers of any taste....provided they give the movie a chance.",RoboCop 2

As long as you're not searching for a profound message in what is, after all, a Hollywood action movie, the you can really, really enjoy this. Some of the humor bits are hilarious, and the movie has a lot of classic scenes, in fact, the whole first 15 minutes of it could be considered a classic scene. People screaming about 'Nuke', Bad fat cop Duffy getting slammed into an arcade game, 'Bad Dudes', and the new robocop prototypes are all things that stick in people's heads. A lot of things Robocop says alone will have you cracking up, (when they turn him into a community role model for instance) and considering Robocop possibly represents the easiest acting job anyone has ever done, that's saying a lot if a monotone delivery can make you laugh. Basically, look to Robocop for a more meaningful movie, look to Robocop 2 for more fun, and more memorable scenes. look for Robocop 3 is you want to watch a 90 minute ad for robocop products, and make fun of punk rockers.",RoboCop 2
192,johntgfkn,a very good sequel,9,4 September 2019,Hugely underrated sequel that has aged well especially when all the horrible sequels and reboot. It's ultra violent and more of the original just to a more extreme level. highly recommended.,RoboCop 2
193,jeroi,Awful sequel to a great movie.,3,25 June 2013,"To be honest, I love action and sci-fi and nerd movies and in my childhood Robocop was my one of my fave movies. To this date I remembered that Robocop 2 was good also and rented both.This movie makes 3 big mistakes. Firstly action with hilarious comic style does not work. You need comic characters for that. Bad actors like major is a joke, robocops handy girl has bad scenes that make her a joke and all and all the whole movie does not take Robocop as a serious movie at all. I found it weird that there is even childish CGI which of original movie was not affected at all and in same time it makes you think what happened to producers after first film? What was they thinking? To me it gave me one thing as I wanted to see after first one. Robocop needed to suffer and then comeback as a hero. But how they did it was comic and failed. It gave me thoughts like did some woman in some meeting suggest one catchy side story of Robocop fooling around with make peace not war attitude. I would of done it so that the woman repairer would had some more serious disagreement with Bad guys and then help robocop to repair it self. I would wanted to see some resistance to elders there but, no lets make it want to smoke weed.Another big issue were, why did they continue to make horrible looking robocops when they had far superior model all ready created. Why they made so childish machines after first one? So much issues in this movie.All and all I find my self so bored that cannot even watch Robocop 3 after this one. I would rate this B or even C-movie.For Robocop suffering and opening theme 3/10.",RoboCop 2

The only thing I recalled was Robocop busting in some warehouse shooting bad guys and ricocheting a bullet of something to kill a guy that was holding a baby hostage. I give this movie a 3 out of ten but if you were to ask my opinion of this film prior to watching it last night I would have said it's at least a 6. This movie doesn't hold up whatsoever. It's ridiculous. At the end there is a what felt like a 45 minute fight scene between two clay action figures that looked like it was a spoof for a robot chicken episode.

195,MrE26,Hugely disappointing sequel.,2,28 April 2003,"I remember really looking forward to this movie back when it was originally released, as i was such a huge fan of Verhoeven's original. When i finally got to see it, i was appalled. The movie is a complete joke, & features one of the cheesiest scripts i've ever seen. The violence in the film is nasty & pointless & has clearly been ramped up in order to try & out-do it's predecessor, the attempts at humour miss the mark completely & the bad guys are just plain annoying (especially the kid, who i wanted to see dead the instant he opened his mouth.) It's just plain silly (12 yr old druglords, drug addicted robots & the sequence where RoboCop has been reprogrammed to be polite is almost unwatchably bad.) They should have brought in the team behind the original (Verhoeven & Neumeier, who teamed up again on the superb Starship Troopers) & made a sequel worthy of the original, instead of cheapening the movie by putting this pile of worthless crap out. Avoid like the plague. P.S. Believe it or not, RoboCop 3's even worse!",RoboCop 2
196,fleecemas,How did the director of Empire direct this mess?,3,1 December 2020,"It's hard to believe that the director that brought us The Empire Strikes Back also gave us this pile of nonsense. Irvin Kershner went from directing the greatest sequel ever made to, arguably, the worst sequel ever made in one short decade. I hate this movie so much.The narrative is flimsy and the entire film is about 30 minutes too long. The commercials and satire that were so funny in the first film are atrocious in this one. The Nancy Allen character, and her relationship with Robocop, was all but abandoned. As were his wife and child, who disappear for the duration of the film. The terrible child actor, that not one adult criminal character would listen to or respect, seems to run the gang at age 12. Cane's girlfriend that, seconds after realizing he is the consciousness inside of a robot, touches his claw and moans sexually, talking about how it will be great with him again. Unintentional hilarity with Robocop appearing to dance, or when his circuit wiring appears like dreadlocks. Unbelievable character motivations and interactions. Hammy overacting by the mayor of Detroit. ""Action"" scenes that make no sense. Even Weller's voice delivery is bad and doesn't sound like in the first film. And the biggest non-ending I've ever seen. Terrible. Just watch the original masterpiece and be done with this franchise.",RoboCop 2
197,Smith006,An Underrated Sequel,9,7 March 2007,"To this day my brain aches from trying to understand the harsh criticism towards this film. Okay, I can understand why people would think its not as good as the original, but to say that it was awful is false (But the third film really sucked).Pros:The acting quality is good, given the type of film your watching. - It still contains satirical television commercials. - Good Action - Nice looking graphics - Good storylineThe cons are few in number. I would have liked to see some of the deleted scenes in the movie that would have built on RoboCop dealing with his loss of a normal life, but it is an action flick. Fans might also feel a little cheated because RoboCops theme isn't present in the film. Im not going to give anything away but when we are expected to feel sorry for the death of a certain character it feels forced and cheesy.The film may not deserve 10 stars but I grew up with RoboCop and I feel the film has aged well and my liking for it has only grown stronger. I recommend you watch it with an open mind and make your own decision.",RoboCop 2

The story is all over the place, characters disappear and we don't know what happened them, and most, if not all, of the scenes which flesh out Murphy's human side are edited out, why?The original plot for this film is brilliant, and I believe that if it had have been used then RoboCop 2 would have been a much better film, and the RoboCop franchise would still be going strong today, and we may even have had a RoboCop 4 in the last 90's.If MGM want to make some decent money, they should release a Directors Cut version of the film which would contain the 15/20 minutes of extra footage that we never saw.

The 2 original versions of the film, which were sadly never made, were brilliant compared to what we got, and only because of an impatient film company was Verhoven not allowed to return to make his second part. Even at that, there are so many cut scenes in this film which were taken out because they apparently didn't fit the film, but they would have made it so much better!Instead we get a rushed job. The acting is top notch as in the first, but the film just doesn't have the same feel. People think the film is too violent, but there was more violence in the first film! The film had a lot of potential, but was sadly treated badly. Hopefully the recent talk of Verhoven and the writers Miner and Neumier wanting to return to make their own sequel to the original classic 'RoboCop' will become solid, and true RoboCop fans will get to see a great character in a great film once again.

I remember going to see this in Pittsburgh when I was in Upward Bound in 1990, and we took a trip there.Anyway when I saw it recently I was surprised at all the cursing the children did in the movie. As a 14 year old in '90 it didn't strike me as odd...but at 39 it was disturbing.I still see the Robocop franchise as strangely prophetic though, moreso than ""strong delusion"".But I noticed one thing odd about it. Amid all the cussing by little kids there was a scene on epicTV that I thought might have been censored.Today is 1/17/15 ant it ran at about 3:00 PM...anyway the scene came up where Gabriel Damon was offering to bail the city out. As Gabriel he was making his spiel to Willard he said ""Don't be a queer."" But Im thinking he said, in the original movie, ""Don't be a FA----, well you know the rest.So I want to know if this was edited, while the rest of the movie and F words said by kids was uncut, but when Gabriel said something that was a gay slur it wad edited.I could be wrong, but was this a edit?",RoboCop 2

A troubled society that cannot solve its own problems and is totally dependable of its worse practices companies sees their decadence spoiling its basic needs and the ruin of their dream. The well described characterization of the main personages, their influence in its society and the behavior of all citizens complete a perfect description of a whole worst case scenario of this society. The special effects are a little bit defective, if observed nowadays, but presented a great advance in the time the movie was released, but it is important to notice that a lot of special effect scenes are real and for those real people participated, in contrast to the computer graphics heavily used today. Worth watching twice or more.",RoboCop 2
203,phil_cartwright,One of the worst sequels ever,3,28 February 2002,"The first and last ten minutes of this movie are OK, the stuff in between is complete garbage.  This movie is inferior to the first Robocop movie in every way, except perhaps the special effects.I won't go into too much detail because other reviewers have done so already in their contributions, but the major points are as follows:The drug dealing kid is totally unbelievable and you just want him to die as soon as possible.  Not because he's evil or bad, but because he is just so damned annoying!  A gang of hardened criminals taking orders from a jumped up little kid? ARE YOU SERIOUS?Cain is pathetic as a villain, and the way he and his gang are able to defeat and hack apart Robocop with ease is just plain stupid.  Compare this part of the movie with the end sequence, and Robocop should have been flattened by Robocop 2 in the final showdown.The scene following this is extremely poor.  It is badly written, acted, and is full of inaccuracies.  How come Robocop is handed over to some no-brain techies to repair instead of being put back together by OCP's Robocop experts?I know that movies like this require no brains and that we shouldn't expect to do much thinking.  However, I don't think that movies should insult people's intelligence and that's pretty much what I feel is happening when I watch this.

Frank Miller as the story writer explains all the anti-""political correctness"" jabs within this particular film and its general reactionary tone. He whiffs as often as he hits home runs when it comes to his writing and this one is a definite strikeout. The villains in particular were total jokes - a 12-year-old ""rich money"" gang leader?

205,iwikjr,"""We're only human""",7,3 June 2009,"Robocop 2 is a harrowing portrayal of what could become of American society in the future. Dystopian cities, filled with drug-addicts and gun-nuts, a broken police force with no want to stop crime, and an enormous sociopath robot with a gigantic machine gun and seemingly infinitive ammunition. The Beginning of the film starts in the fashion of the genre, with a news broadcast stating the most threatening element in Detroit city at that time, Nuke. ""The most addictive narcotic known to man."" The police are still on strike, all except robocop and his partner lewis. Robo's entrance is top notch, a film scene which should be considered a classic. When i first seen his foot slamming on the ground i felt like cheering. The scenes to follow, however, did seem disappointing to me. Murphy-at the end of the first film- had lost the robotic overtone to his voice, the character has regressed though, and this has returned stronger than ever. in the scene where robo talks with his wife, you'll think that robo is being heartless and cold, but when you see the scene after where he watches her getting into her car, you see the disappointment on his face. Peter Weller is fantastic as usual, and this is a little gem of a scene. The rest of the film consists of three things: Bad language, humour and violence. The soundtrack was not as good as its predecessors. It sounded more like the tune to a TV show than a Hollywood movie. Irvin Kershner, the director of the empire strikes back, was given a very short time to make this film, a few weeks. I think he did a superb job considering. This film will always be slammed for its over the top violence, especially the scene where Hob dies holding Robo's hand. It was enjoyable though, and as an action film it really is better than most out there. At the end, Robo famously states, ""We're only human,"" another great scene, and ending it on a high was a great move.iwikjr",RoboCop 2
206,supersixsevenmd,Robocop 2 is magnificent!,7,21 February 2011,"The problem with ""Robocop 2"" is that it doesn't adhere to the rigid, unwavering demands of the average movie critic who seems to expect the same things from every movie -- character development, following through with themes and ideas, each scene being directly relevant to the story, relationships, and so on. Thus, it's easy to see why virtually no movie critic out there liked this film. When measuring its quality by a set of criteria intended for films like ""When Harry Met Sally"" or ""The Godfather"", it's no surprise that ""Robocop 2"" would receive mostly lousy reviews. The reality, though, is that ""Robocop 2"" is a spectacular film. Here's why: First and foremost, the plot is magnificent! (SPOILERS HERE).Most of the police are on strike and the Detroit is in chaos. Crime runs rampant. The CEO of OCP wants to privatize Detroit and has swindled the mayor in order to make this possible. Meanwhile, a new designed drug called Nuke is being used throughout Detroit, and Robocop seeks to eradicate it. In the process, he nearly kills Caine, the drug-lord responsible for the Nuke epidemic. Concurrently, an ambitious researcher at OCP (Dr. Faxx, who is sleeping with the CEO for professional gain) is looking to design a second Robocop, and determines that the best way to do so is to use the brain of a drug-addict despite her colleagues' protests. When the opportunity presents itself, she reprograms Robocop to be utterly lame, and she murders Caine in his hospital bed and turns him into Robocop 2. The mayor, in order to prevent Detroit from being taken over by OCP, plans to strike a deal with Caine's second-in-command, a twelve year-old criminal named Hobb, who promises to pay all of Detroits debts to OCP in return for allowing Nuke to be manufactured unmolested by the Detroit police. OCP executives get wind of this plan, and together with Dr. Faxx, decide to utilize Robocop 2 to kill the mayor while he meets with Hobb. Many are killed, as you can imagine, including Hobb, but the mayor escapes.Shifting gears, the CEO holds a press conference (which the mayor attends) to introduce to the public a model of the new and privatized Detroit as well as Robocop 2, the new version with the firepower to keep the public safe. Robocop enters the hall, Robocop 2 goes berserk, fighting ensues, many bystanders are killed, and ultimately Robocop kills Robocop 2. The CEO, of course, escapes and a plan is quickly formed to blame the entire catastrophe on Dr. Faxx in order to allow him to go Scot-free.It's worth mentioning here that the description above is a simplified account of the story, and that the plot is indeed intricate, coherent, and downright interesting.Moreover, you have to remember that there are movies with vastly more simplistic plots than this that have been awarded Oscars for best picture and/or best original screenplay in the past: ""Gladiator"" comes to mind, as does ""Titanic"", ""No Country for Old Men"", ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"", and many others. All of these films, while excelling in other areas, had almost childishly-simple story lines.The problem with ""Robocop 2"" is that it's much more eccentric and satirical than its predecessor, ""Robocop"". Put differently: unlike its predecessor, it's a film that was meant entirely not to be taken seriously -- a task that movie critics simply cannot perform. Since ""Robocop 2"" is neither a serious drama nor a comedy, it is to most critics two hours of pure satire, and it was reviewed accordingly. Read any review of the film and you'll see that most of them consist of little more than harsh criticism of the film's eccentricities and satire.The reality is that when you view this film with an open mind and without any expectations, you will find it to be odd, even corny at times, and incredibly entertaining! A great plot, interesting (albeit static) characters, decent special-effects, a little bit of comedy, and plenty of action to go around can all be found.

207,ChuckNorris,The Greatest Movie Ever,10,7 April 2004,"No matter what anyone says, Robocop 2 is the greatest movie ever. Don't trust all of these other reviews. They have no idea what they are talking about. This Movie is a cinematic masterpiece. Everything about it is perfect and it deserves a place as the greatest movie of all time.First off, the first Robocop used to be the best movie of all time until its sequel came out. What makes it better you ask? Well it simply improves upon the original in every way. The first thing you need to look at is the ""coolness"" factor of Robocop. He is simply the coolest character of all time. He doesn't take lip from anybody. This movie proves it. They try to make him moral and stuff but all he wants to do is kill people in true Robocop fashion.The real reason why this movie is better than the first movie is that it answers an age old question: What is cooler than Robocop? The answer would be TWO Robocops fighting each other to the death. With big guns. You can't simply get better than this (Except if you have three Robocops. Why hasn't anyone thought of this genius idea?) Some might say that the big Robocop looks stupid but those people don't know what a good movie is. This key element puts this movie on the pantheon of greatness.If you still aren't convinced that Robocop 2 is the best movie ever made, then they just need to quit watching movies. This movie is so good that you will want to watch it twice in a row. No joke. The acting is incredible. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and get up now and go watch it.",RoboCop 2

I loved Robocop 1 and I was hoping that this would be a great sequel kind of like Terminator 2. But nope, this movie is just a big joke. It makes no sense, it's REALLY hard to understand, it REALLY lacks action and it's instead really BORING, the story is completely screwed up and it's clearly WAAAAAY to lazy. And the worst part is the end, the movie has probably the worst wrap up I have ever seen, it just ends when you're about to expect more. I mean many people say that Terminator 2 is better than the first one and I think there right. But this movie is the exact opposite as well as the biggest excuse for a sequel I have ever seen. I wasted 2 hours with this horrible movie and make sure you don't waste your precious hours on it too. If you haven't seen Terminator 2 but have seen Terminator 1, then watch Terminator 2 instead. But if you haven't seen any of the Terminator movies then go watch 1 and 2 (I haven't seen Terminator 3 but I have VERY low expectations for it).But yeah, anyways, I have THE MOST LOW EXPECTATIONS EVER for Robocop 3 because IMDb actually gives it 3/10 instead of the 5/10 that they gave this movie.

Just when I saw that blue metal foot going out of a cop car I realized we were.It was RoboCop 2. Oh, I had seen that film one or two times before! I don't want to repeat, but there is one word that describes this movie... ridiculous. The shooting scenes, the blood, the bad guys, that robot! I know this doesn't seem to be a professional review, not even objective. But RoboCop 2 is just too cheesy to consider it a good option.The plot is simple; there is a gang selling drugs, the city is out of control, a corporation is trying to take Detroit... and they are even about to replace Robo! He has to do something, any suggestions? Of course! Our tin friend gets his gun and shoots all the gangsters. Don't forget he's invincible; bullets make him no harm, never misses a shot and things like that. Isn't that an interesting character?In spite of all this, I didn't have a bad time... the film is a million laughs.

214,kurolikesgames,"Not a bad movie, but a slight step down from the original.",7,18 June 2018,"RoboCop was a great movie. After earning critical success amongst both critics and casual moviegoers and earning a profit of around forty million dollars, it only made sense for Orion Pictures to follow up with a sequel. Does RoboCop 2 hold a candle to the original? In a way, yes.RoboCop 2 takes place about one year after the events of the original film. The RoboCop project was a success, and OmniCorp, the creators of the project, begin research and development for a successor. Meanwhile, Alexander J. Murphy, also known as RoboCop, continues his duties as a Detroit police officer. However, a new addictive substance sweeps the city. Nuke. Created by Cain, a fanatical cult leader hopelessly addicted to his own drug.The plot is interesting, but it's not perfect. A lot of plot points introduced near the beginning are all but abandoned. RoboCop's relationship with his wife and and the doubt of his own humanity are threads that would have held weight and kept the plot interesting. However, they are dropped rather quickly, instead focusing on OmniCorp's attempted purchase of Detroit. The movie still contains most of the comedy that made the original funny, but quite a few are rehashed from the original.This film was made on a budget of thirty-five million dollars, a rather large upgrade from the original's, and it shows. Animations that seemed charmingly clunky in the original are smooth and get the job done. The use of CGI is done sparingly and doesn't feel awkward or out-of-place, and the practical effects, such as RoboCop's suit, continue to hold up today. However, that doesn't mean that it's flawless. The CGI used on RoboCop 2's digital ""face"" consists of low-quality, flatshaded polygons that look downright terrifying at points, and it doesn't even look remotely like the person it is trying to portray. It could have been much more appealing if they simply filmed actor Tom Noonan and superimposed his face onto the cyborg's facial screen. This film is still gory, but not to the extent of the original. They were holding back, with no real reason too. Once again, the acting is great. Peter Weller slides back into his character like a knife into butter. The moments he expressed pain were especially impressive. Nancy Allen also provided a good performance as Officer Anne Lewis. Noonan was decent as Cain, but was a little too ""hammy"" at times.Overall, RoboCop 2 is a good film, and a worthy, albeit flawed, successor to the original. It may be more difficult for people unfamiliar with the series to enjoy, but fans will have fun. It's above-average and better than a few of it's competitors. If you're a fan of the original, give it a try.",RoboCop 2

You can't take this one too seriously, whereas the first Robocop had a quite dreary and realistic tone, this sequel just wants to kick butt. I'd called it the Empire Strikes Back of the Robocop series (and ironically it involves the same director), because the plot is more complex and daring. There are many memorable characters, outrageous concepts, and an audacious plot. The best thing is that it doesn't take itself seriously, but at the same time, goes all the way with its bold plot! I'd rank this movie in the same group of genre-defining Sci-Fi-Romps as: Total Recall, Running Man, and Starship Troopers.
