0,SnoopyStyle,really like Ashley and Luke,6,7 December 2017,"It's the snowy Christmas season in the suburbs. Ashley is hired by the Lerners (Patrick Warburton, Virginia Madsen) to babysit their son Luke. Luke has a crush on Ashley with a plan to seduce her. She's avoiding her boyfriend Ricky. Strange things happen and Luke's irreverent friend Garrett shows up.The twist is pretty obvious. It does go off on an interesting direction. I really like Ashley and Luke. Ricky is overplayed as a douche-bag. The problem is that it's hard to see Ashley dating that annoying guy. Same goes for the other annoying guy. She must have bad taste in guys which is very disappointing. Garrett should be played more as a dim-wit. He has to submit in a powerless way to Luke which would fit the needed dynamics. Otherwise, he should be as into the craziness of the scheme as Luke. Ashley is good and Luke is great. The boy is doing some great acting. I don't like the other characterizations as much.",Better Watch Out

Luke is seriously crushing on Ashley as he helps defend her in a home break-in that has a wicked twist.I enjoyed the film, although there was room for improvement. Acting was decent. Most likely won't become a Christmas classic. Has some cultish aspect to it.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Better Watch Out
2,kosmasp,Horror Kevin alone at home,5,19 October 2017,"I had no idea what to expect when I watched this at Frightfest, but it became apparent pretty early on. To me that is, not so much to some other characters in the movie. And while it does have a nice pace and has quite some neat humor to it, it has evil intents overall. Which is how the movie works and it does a good job with it.The acting is pretty good especially from the main kid character, who shows quite a stretch. But also the female lead, who seems to be a bit lightheaded, but there is more to her too. And the effects are probably another reason to watch it. The ideas of ... what happens sort of. And it's all nice with a twist I would agree with towards the end ... all just to be spoiled by a last second ... different twist. That wasn't necessary, but here we go ...",Better Watch Out
3,Woodyanders,Turns the home invasion horror genre completely on its ear,8,20 December 2018,"The basic plot sounds deceptively familiar: Plucky babysitter Ashley (a fine and appealing portrayal by the foxy Olivia DeJonge) and smitten 12-year-old boy Luke (an excellent performance by Levi Miller) find themselves in considerable jeopardy when an intruder breaks into the house on Christmas Eve. However, that ain't the half of it.Director/co-writer Chris Peckover and co-writer Zack Kahn throw a splendidly sick spammer into the works in the form of a wickedly clever twist that takes the standard home invasion premise in a dark and depraved direction that's both blackly funny and seriously unsettling in equal measure. Moreover, the enjoyably unhinged story whisks along at a constant brisk pace, Peckover ably crafts plenty of tension as well as presents a flavorsome yuletide atmosphere, the moments of sadistic violence pack a ferocious punch, and the sense of nasty dark humor proves to be quite sidesplitting in an admittedly warped sort of way. The sound acting by the capable cast helps lot: Miller has a field day as a crafty kid with all kinds of cruel tricks up his sleeve, Ed Oxenbould lends sturdy support as Luke's nerdy best friend Garrett, and Patrick Warburton and Virginia Madsen contribute amusing cameos as Luke's bickering parents. Kudos are also in order for Carl Robertson's sharp widescreen cinematography and Brian Cachia's spirited shivery score. A twisted treat.",Better Watch Out
4,BA_Harrison,It's good (for goodness sake).,9,23 October 2017,"Knowing too much about the plot prior to seeing Better Watch Out is like feeling your presents under the Christmas tree: it will spoil the surprise. For this reason, I'm going to keep the twists and turns under wraps, suffice to say that director Chris Peckover has something quite unexpected in store for you.At first, I thought I had the film all figured out, the opening scenes following a fairly typical home invasion story-line: a twelve year old, Luke (Levi Miller), and his pretty babysitter, Ashley (Olivia DeJonge), are threatened by an unseen menace that warns 'If U Leave, U Die!'. But just as we are rolling our eyes at the predictability of the plot, Peckover pulls the rug out from under our feet, and continues to do so for the rest of the movie.It all works brilliantly, the movie getting darker and more demented as it progresses, its effectiveness no doubt helped by a thoroughly convincing central performance from its young lead, Miller, with able support from the delightful DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould as Luke's nerdy best bud Garrett.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",Better Watch Out
5,paul_haakonsen,It was actually quite alright...,6,12 June 2018,"I had no expectation for this movie, so I didn't even know what I was sitting down to watch.It turned out to be a vamped up ""Home Alone"" just taken to a whole new level.""Better Watch Out"" definitely had an interesting concept and idea for the storyline. However, it also had a very unpredictable plot, which was a stone weighing the movie down. But the story as a whole seemed somewhat implausible.There was some good acting from the cast, and it was clear that the people here were enjoying what they had to work with.""Better Watch Out"" is a movie that you immerse yourself into while watching. I will say that the movie is somewhat similar to the ""The Babysitter"" movie from 2017.If you enjoy a good, albeit not overly scary, horror movie, then ""Better Watch Out"" is a fair choice for a single viewing.",Better Watch Out
6,Coventry,"Joy to the world, good Christmas Horror is NOT dead!",8,8 January 2020,"Actually, I could even rephrase and state that good horror in general is not dead, because ""Better Watch Out"" would work just as effectively without the Christmas setting and decorations as well. I think I even read that, at one point, the film was planned as a ""regular"" horror release under the title ""Safe Neighborhood"". Still, I - for one - am very happy that it became a Christmas horror film, since I have the silly tradition to watch at least one of those during the holiday period! In case you love Christmas horror as well, I can warmly recommend ""Better Watch Out""; - preferably even after having watched ""Home Alone"" with the entire family, and after the children went to bed.If you haven't seen ""Better Watch Out"" yet, it is utmost crucial to avoid spoilers! I'll try not to reveal anything here, but it's simply better not to read any reviews at all in advance. Knowing certain plot twists from beforehand might not entirely ruin your viewing experience, but unawareness and the element of surprise are definitely major added values. I have seen more than 4,000 horrors and thrillers of all sorts over the past 20 years, including certain ones that featured more or less the same abrupt plot twists, but nevertheless I didn't see the twist in ""Better Watch Out"" coming. Love it when that happens! The script isn't totally unique or 100% original, mind you. The plot twist idea has been done before, but it's the accomplishment of co-writer/director Chris Peckover (previously unknown to me) that he brings it unexpectedly and even quite shockingly. And, as well, thanks to the very talented and convincing cast.When browsing through the other user comments around here and online, I notice a lot of people deeply dislike ""Better Watch Out"" for the exact same reasons that I (and luckily many others with me) admire it so much. Bluntly said, yes, this is a ""either hate or love it"" type of film. Haters claim the scenario is utterly implausible, dumb and far-fetched. Fans, on the other hand, are likely to praise the writers' courage and out-of-the-box thinking style. Big fans, like me, even daresay the plot isn't too impossible at all. Aside from these discussions, ""Better Watch Out"" inarguably also is a very competent thriller/slasher with great suspense, twisted humor and a handful of nasty moments. The references and homages to the almighty and indestructible Christmas classic ""Home Alone"" are sublime.",Better Watch Out
7,hitchcockthelegend,Yuletide log slips from the fire to ignite the Xmas horror movie sub-genre.,7,26 December 2018,"Lets have it right, the 1/10 reviews are from hardcore horror fans who just didn't get the horror experience they was looking for. That's understandable, it's one of the toughest genres to please given the broadness available, but what of those who go in blind who are just after a bit of chilly yuletide nastiness?Director Chris Peckover and his co-writer Zack Khan have given not just the Xmas horror film genre a shot in the arm, but also put a clever spin on the home invasion formula - the latter of which a formula that grew stale a long time ago. Now I can't vouch for trailers etc, so if folk have been misled then it's tough turkey at yuletide, but going in fresh without expectation levels - to just rock up for a viewing purely because it's an Xmas horror pic, then the rewards are plenty.The makers make a move early to lay down a marker that all is not as it seems, and from there the surprises continue to flow with disturbing glee. We could argue it's in bad taste in this day and age as the fear of youth grows ever more acute, maybe? But it's a nice rug pull and the momentum never lets up right to the devilish resolution. Job done for me. Implausible probabilities and ridiculous actions in a horror film? Surely not...This is funny in a dark way, cheekily troubling in its choice of protagonists to propel the piece, and it's nicely performed by the youthful cast. It's no Black Christmas or any other of those blood soaked Crimble horrors, this has a glint in its eye and amen to that. 7/10",Better Watch Out
8,Hey_Sweden,Best use of a paint can since Home Alone.,6,2 December 2020,"The appealing Olivia DeJonge (""The Visit"") stars as a teenaged babysitter looking after a pre-teen charge (Levi Miller, ""Jasper Jones"") at Christmastime. Soon, it seems as if they are being menaced by a psycho killer, but appearances can be deceiving. The plot takes a turn where the menace is coming from a place that DeJonge didn't expect.Admittedly, for this viewer, this was rough going for a while, with too much bad dialogue and too many annoying characters. If you're anything like me, you'll build up such a contempt for the weaselly antagonist that you'll watch this through to the end in the hopes that they eventually get their comeuppance. And make no mistake: this person is despicable, using and manipulating others to their hearts' content. As the story deepens, co-writer / director Chris Peckover is able to maintain a compelling grimness as these macabre ""games"" are played out.The cast does a good job with their roles, with DeJonge remaining angry and feisty throughout, never giving up the fight. She, at least, gives the audience a character with rooting interest. Ed Oxenbould (""Paper Planes""), Aleks Mikic ('Preacher'), and Dacre Montgomery ('Stranger Things') co-star, with token name actors / veterans Virginia Madsen (""Candyman"") and Patrick Warburton ('Seinfeld') relegated to brief cameo appearances as Millers' parents.This viewer has tried not to spoil too much here, knowing that potential viewers will appreciate this more if THEY don't know what to expect. I will say this: the filmmakers clearly do know how to manipulate their audience and get them involved; this is a purely visceral movie.Six out of 10.",Better Watch Out
9,neil-476,A cut above the usual,8,2 May 2018,"Ashley has been babysitting Luke since he was 8. He is now 12, going on 13. A pre-Christmas dinner takes his parents out, following which a home invasion means that Ashley needs to be unusually resourceful.This horror-ish movie, with strong elements of black comedy, starts out in utterly predictable mode, with scads of not-very-gracefully orchestrated made-you-jump moments. There is a reason why this film works so hard early on to make you believe that it is a by-rote home invasion movie, and that is because it wants to spring a trap on you.It won't work for everyone, but it worked for me, and turned this film from something I was expecting to something I really wasn't. And I don't want to say more than that.If you don't like this sort of movie then there is no reason to expect you will like this one. If, on the other hand, you do enjoy the suspense of home murder movies, but you are fed up with their predictability, then try this one - it may offer you some surprises.",Better Watch Out
10,morrison-dylan-fan,The Babysitter.,7,28 December 2018,"Talking to a friend about movies he had recently seen in the run-up to Christmas,I got told about a X-Mas set Horror he had randomly caught on Now TV,and had found to be a surprisingly very good Horror. Preparing to view Black Christmas (1974-also reviewed) again, I decided to double bill it, and that it was time to watch out.View on the film:Building up a snowstorm from a plot twist pencilled in at the half-way point, the excellent performances by Levi Miller and Ed Oxenbould as Luke and Garrett really make the twist work, thanks to Miller giving Luke an ambiguity between childish teasing, and an increasingly unsettling wide-grin, blank stare void, while Oxenbould gives Garrett a casual slacker state open to manipulation.Reuniting with Oxenbould after M. Night Shyamalan's return to praise and box office success with The Visit (2015), Olivia DeJonge gives a live-wire turn as Ashley, whose initial babysitting of Luke is given a pointed comedic edge by DeJonge, which breaks into horror by DeJonge turning the screws on Ashley's sinking fear, and scarping to survive.Returning to the screen for the first time since the torture- Horror Undocumented (2010), co-writer/(with Zack Khan) director Chris Peckover & cinematographer Carl Robertson imaginatively use Christmas decorations and the scenery to give the flick a macabre edge that leaves the pure driven snow red, and (excluding the mid-credits scene) frames the final shot like the front of a Christmas card with a wry grin.Continuing to have torture be an element in his films, Peckover wraps the film in the psychological effects of it in tight close-ups on faces giving the horror a tense chill,along with sound effects and dabs of paint and blood on the floor suggestively drawing what has taken place.Hanging up the decorations with a comedic playfulness in the opening, the screenplay by Peckover and Khan superbly snowballs comedy with Home-Invasion thrills, via Ashley's relaxed attitude to babysitting creaking under unexplained noises and broken glass.Opening up the present to the viewer, the writers wonderfully free the twists and turns to glitter, by continuing to gradual build the fraught relationship between the trio,as Ashley discovers that it is better to watch out.",Better Watch Out
11,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Enjoyable if still slightly flawed effort,8,9 December 2017,"Returning home for the holidays, a young woman babysitting friends for the last time before she leaves finds themselves under attack by a series of masked intruders, but once they realize the truth about the situation leads into a far more dangerous situation than they ever expected.This turned out to be quite the enjoyable and engaging effort. One of the better features of this one is the fact that there's quite a strong relationship at the core of film which is shown in the first half. The main couple has a rather fun and friendly relationship that they can joke about with each other and he turns it around on her pretty well as the second half becomes a far more brutal situation. That gives the later attacks quite a vicious charge as her need to protect them from the intruder is intensely thrilling with their antics around the house giving off not only a series of great action-packed encounters running around the house while giving off a sense of suspense with the need for protection established early on. It's once the film changes over into the second half that it becomes even more perverted and disturbing with the way it becomes about the tables being turned on them in a way that's far more chilling in the actions that play out. As everything is based around the concept of the behavioral shift holding the group hostage in the manner done and forcing the kind of tense and thrilling motives established here, that really manages to add a rather chilling narrative to the whole affair and really enhances the film in this aspect. With a sense of brutality in the kills as well as the exceptionally fun plan that is used to try to get away with it all, these here manage to hold this one up over it's few minor yet still prominent issues. The main problem with this one is the fact that there's such a dispiriting and unneeded changeover in the way this plays out as far too much of the second half is drained with the lessened tension of the situation. Overall, it changes the dynamic way too much into a setup it never needed to go towards since it had way too much to like with the setup as it was which really does lower the way this comes off since everything is twisted around into being changed when it didn't need to be. The last flaw here is the way the film manages to go through the whole second half with plenty of times to catch on to what's happening yet nothing is spotted when it could've been quite easily noticed and foiled their plans numerous times over. Combined, these issues really drag this one down.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, underage drug and alcohol use and intense themes of children in jeopardy.",Better Watch Out

13,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Tonally inconsistent, slightly seedy and generally a film of two halves, this alternative Christmas flick is still subversive, interesting and at times surprisingly tough.",6,8 December 2017,"'Better Watch Out (2016)' is a surprisingly subversive film which callously carves its way through a few different sub-genres during its perhaps ill-fated journey to be a both an alternative Christmas flick and a comedy-horror hit. It ends up missing the mark when it comes to both mass-marketed targets, though, due to the somewhat sadistic, slightly seedy and certainly sinister spin it puts on things once it pulls the rug out from under you and undergoes the total tonal transformation that is central to its story. While this sudden switch into disturbing domestic terror does provide a relatively fresh experience, its chaotic cruelty and downbeat desperation is both initially confusing and incredibly frustrating once the picture progresses towards its increasingly bleak conclusion - which is interestingly reigned in ever so slightly (obviously a late addition), dampening the horrifically hopeless effect perhaps being aimed for. Although the way in which it all progresses is interesting, engaging and, at times, toe-curlingly tough, the flick never gets a proper grip on its tone. It pulls some punches with oddly timed jokes but also leans far enough into its nastier side to surely put a fair few people off and prevent the affair from being the holiday hit it seems to try so hard to be. It plays with certain genre tropes, commenting on the surface-level 'sickness' of violent 'black comedy', but ends up relishing in them just as much. You're being sold 'Home Alone (1990)' crossed with 'The Strangers (2008)', but its almost more like Christmas-time 'Funny Games (1997)'. 6/10.",Better Watch Out
14,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7,7 December 2017,"Better Watch Out  To ward off would be Christmas thieves put an inflatable menorah on  your lawn  Unfortunately, the invaders in this horror-comedy are already inside  the home.  Despite being preteen, Luke's (Levi Miller) parents (Patrick Warburton,  Virginia Madsen) still insist on Ashley (Olivia DeJonge) babysitting  him while they are out.  Planning on confessing his love to Ashley, Luke's declaration is  disrupted by his friend Garret (Ed Oxenbould). The trio later receives  a note warning them not to leave the house. When Garret disobeys the  directive, his death begets a night unlike any other.  Containing the most shocking mid-way twist reveal in years, this  sadistic salute to seasonal standards starring mischievous little boys  turns the fair-haired archetype on its severed heads.

17,Reno-Rangan,The night of the loss of an innocence!,4,24 February 2018,"I don't dislike it, but this is not my kind of entertainment. Not anymore. The 90s films made some sense, but this one looked too innocent to portray such young people in a such a cruel shade. Probably I could have accepted it with a different cast. Anyway, I did not know what's coming. That's great to keep me guessing, but twist came in so early and after that it lost the track forever. It ended as I'd predicted. If you okay with cliche, then you will like the end and so the film.Like usual a kid fallen in love with his babysitter. The night turns into a hell of a night after a chain of events. Most of it you could probably won't be expecting. Once the secret has been broken, the next stage of the tale was all about survival and fight back. But once again the story takes a twist before the end. I know these youngsters from other films. They were excellent, but the film was an average.The only best thing about it is it slightly being different than others. There's nothing new in the basic platform. The same setting that we've seen in hundreds of films, but the characters makes a somewhat difference. Seeing how it had ended, there could be a sequel. But that's how some films end, which does not mean a road to a follow up. I did not, but you might enjoy it, so I think not a bad idea for giving it a try.4/10",Better Watch Out
18,TheMovieDiorama,"Better Watch Out wishes you a ""Merry Christmas"" by giving you 'Home Alone' on way too much mulled wine.",7,2 July 2018,"Having completely unacknowledged this horror for quite some time, I actually removed it from my mind. It caught me by surprise one day, bought it, and here we are reviewing a Christmas film in the peak of summer season (sounds about right...). So, naturally, I had no idea what I was getting into except that it resembled a home invasion film. Oh boy, was I wrong. A babysitter is summoned to watch over a family's son and house whilst the parents go out. The son is hoping to get to ""second base"" with the babysitter, but his plans are paused as the house is seemingly invaded by a masked individual. Let the festivities, begin! Reminiscent to 'Home Alone', it's a story involving mind games where the residents are at an advantage for knowing the layout of their abode, with a specific scene so self-aware that it actually admits to imitating that very film. But, it's not all sweet like gingerbread men and candy canes. Oh no, there is one heck of a twist that I just cannot verbalise, for it would ruin the surprise. And well, who doesn't like a surprise gift at Christmas? Writer/Director Peckover seamlessly persuades the audience's minds into a false sense of security, luring them down the route of obviousness. We are now Christmas pudding in his hands, and he moulds his way through many well executed twists and turns that unsurprisingly caught me off guard. Deranged, yet psychologically entertaining. DeJonge and Miller give fantastic performances, particularly the latter who was clearly enjoying the role. It's well shot, with technical inventiveness, and includes a rather funny screenplay, but above all it is fun. Good old fashion fun. Frequently, the pacing does dip and takes some time for the thrills to build back up. Also, as elaborate as the conclusion was, it just wasn't believable. Alas, the film knows what it is. A disposable thriller that injects some blood-soaked holiday spirit into Christmas. This will certainly be a new favourite of mine during the holiday season.",Better Watch Out

I knew very little about it going in, but got the impression it was a home-invasion, survival film between a young boy and girl (who may or may not fall in love along the way). Little did I know just how little I knew however. What instead took place were 90 minutes of the best horror film I have seen in a while.I loved every aspect of this film. The writing was superb first and foremost. The most important factor to a good horror movie is making the characters both likeable and believable. This film nailed that. The whole cast were terrific but Levi Miller blew me away with a performance well beyond his years. This is where the future of horror has to go if it has any chance of surviving. People are done with the jump-scares and creepy looking monsters. They want realistic brutality from characters that they can actually remember for more than 5 minutes after leaving the cinema.

Lack of patience meant that I broke my tradition of only watching Xmas movies in December. Had I waited 8 months I may have enjoyed it slightly more. The film itself is a pretty entertaining ride of twists and dark humour, reasonsbly well acted and fairly brutal in places. However, Levi Miller was obviously older than the 12 year old that he was playing. It features Carol of the Bells, one of my favourite festive songs.

Hard to believe this is the 12th year of the festival, which features a plethora of relatively new scary films each year – along with one or two older classics as well.Opening the scares this year was Better Watch Out, directed by Chris Peckover and starring Olivia DeJonge (The Visit) as a babysitter watching a precocious 12-year-old named Luke (Levi Miller) while his parents (Virginia Madsen and Patrick Warburton) enjoy a night out of the house. Babysitter Ashley quickly finds herself in for more than just a night on the couch watching movies, as she has to deal with her young charge – who has long had a crush on his sitter – and then a home invasion.But this ain't no ordinary home invasion. I can't tell you all more than that. I wish I could, but I really want you to watch this movie, and telling you more of the story would ruin the experience for you. There are a lot of surprises in this movie. Plenty of plausible but unpredictable twists. The movie is tightly plotted (by Peckover and Zack Kahn).The performances are phenomenal, especially considering the ages and relative lack of experience of the leads. Miller, in particular, is a wonder to behold; his Luke shifts tone rather dramatically over the course of the movie, but his skills make the shift utterly believable and magical. There aren't many adult actors who could pull off the characterization that Levi Miller does in this film.Come for the intrigue of a vulnerable babysitter protecting her young charge but stay when that trope is turned completely upside down.",Better Watch Out

30,jfgibson73,Spoilers in this review,7,23 September 2019,"In this movie, a babysitter and the young boy who has a crush on her, are pestered by home invaders. It is revealed early on that this is just a ruse staged by the boy so that he can ""save"" the girl and win her affection. It goes wrong, and the boy reveals himself to be unhinged. He holds the babysitter hostage and calls her exboyfriends over to kill and frame them. In his ruthlessness, he even murders his own best friend. Sadly, the ending sees our main character, the babysitter, killed by a stab to the throat. But wait! When the police arrive, she is not dead! She stopped the bleeding with the some of the duct tape she was held captive with! I liked that ending. This would have worked better as a short film. Otherwise, there is not enough action to really fill the feature runtime. However, I enjoyed watching through it and being suprised by the twists. If you read my review before watching the movie, you will not be surprised by the twists, so I will categorize this as a ""spoiler.""",Better Watch Out
31,aidanratesmovies,Purely Twisted Holiday Fun,10,14 October 2020,"Better Watch Out is a film truly unlike any other, and I applaud it for its cleverness, wonderful execution, and very entertaining premise. At first the film starts out somewhat average, but needless to say, and to say so without providing spoilers, nothing is as it seems. I loved this movie, I have been holding off on watching it since it came out nearly half a decade ago. This film is brilliantly written, wonderfully executed, and surprisingly really well acted. First off, Levi Miller, is fantastic as Luke, he seriously deserved like an Oscar nomination for his role in this flick. The rest of the supporting cast is quite good as well, notably Olivia DeJonge, Patrick Warburton, and a surprising early casting role for Stranger Things actor Dacre Montgomery. Its thoroughly entertaining throughout, and besides a few cliches here and there, it comes together quite nicely, and packs quite a punch. There are so many messed up moments in this film, which I won't spoil, but you have to see for yourself, just because of how insane they are. The score is great, a wonderful slew of ironically poppy and joyful christmas songs, and some great cinematography as well. In the end, Better Watch Out is a fantastic Christmas Horror-Comedy with so much to say for itself, and so much to remember about it. It's a clever and deeply underrated little gem that I beg fans of Christmas films, horror films, and films in general to give a try.
My Rating: 9.75/10",Better Watch Out
32,peterp-450-298716,Horror and Christmas ? What a jolly combination!,7,6 March 2018,"""I am not drunk and I am not a kiddo.
You're 12.
Thirteen in a few weeks. I'm mature for my age.
I know.
If I were your age, I'd date you.""Believe it or not, I found this ""Home Alone"" slasher version reasonably amusing. If you think this is the umpteenth horror with a home invasion as subject, you're in for a surprise. It's not just the unexpected twist at the beginning of the film, which results in a completely different concept. There's also this moment when you think ""Jesus, what a bright boy"" and yet again they come up with a smartly conceived apotheosis. ""Better watch out"" isn't only unnerving. At the same time it's also pretty funny at times. Though, in an obscure way. It's not really frightening. But after a certain period of time that unpleasant feeling comes over you when you realize such disturbed, youthful individuals exist in the real world.I do like horrors set during the Christmas period. The contrast between this peaceful feast when everyone is happy and cheerful while celebrating this atmospheric period with their family and the bloody story filled with hatred, is immense. You can compare it with the enormous contrast between an extremely white snow carpet and the dark red blood that usually flows abundantly. And to be honest, I love watching movies such as ""Krampus"", ""Santa's Claus"" or this ""Better watch out"" instead of the traditional Christmas movies, like ""White Christmas"" for example. It's more fun than the usual mushy Christmas scenes full of cheerfully singing people.I advise you to ignore your prejudices the first thirty minutes. And don't jump to any conclusion too soon. This time your patience will be rewarded. This movie isn't like these immeasurably other films where you are patiently waiting for a change. A change that'll make it less boring and go into a more interesting direction. And most of the times that change isn't showing up anyway. In ""Better watch out"" the twist has such an impact, the story is completely turned upside down. Unbelief will have hold over you while witnessing how a ""Hush"" -like scenario suddenly turns into a demonic, psychotic master plan.Also, nothing but praise for the youthful actors. Luke (Levi ""Pan"" Miller) is a cuddly, innocent-looking 12-year-old teenager who thinks he is mature enough to seduce the love of his life before she disappears from his life for good. On the other hand, under his bed there's this device that produces the sounds of an uterus. He firmly believes that teenage girls get horny when they are scared. And that's what he's going to do. He's going to put his theory into practice in order to get to ""second base"". And the one he's trying that theory on, is Ashley (Olivia DeJonge), a 17-year-old beautiful girl. A future Miss Beauty who probably gets lots of male attention. If only I had such a babysitter when I was 12. And finally there's Garrett (Ed Oxenbould), the nerdy-looking friend of Luke. Little does he know he's being manipulated by his so-called best friend. These three key figures acted convincing and full of enthusiasm.You could say that ""Better watch out"" is an ingenious, surprising and a brilliant movie, to say the least. Maybe it all sounds rather vague, but this is necessary so I won't spoil the fun. For me, this can be regarded as a Christmas classic and use this as a replacement for the annually recurring ""Home Alone"" broadcasts. Even though it's a sort of a horror and the undertone is pretty disturbing, it's a movie everyone can handle. No bloody or gory scenes in this movie. Just a constant sense of threat. And also, thanks to this short horror film, the eponymous Christmas classic among the Christmas songs suddenly sounds more lugubrious.",Better Watch Out
33,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Great Twist on the Home Invasion,9,13 January 2019,"This was a film that I had heard about last year around this time, but I wasn't subscribed to Shudder so I was unable to see it. Since this year I'm watching either new or Christmas themed horror films during December. The official synopsis for this film is on a quiet suburban street, a babysitter must defend a twelve-year-old boy from intruders, only to discover it's far from a normal home invasion.Coming into this film, I knew that it was taking place in the winter and that it was kind of a home invasion. I had heard it compared to The Babysitter, which I personally enjoyed, so I was intrigued. We start off with a young woman, Ashley (Olivia DeJonge), who is moving to Pittsburgh very soon going over to the house she babysits at. She wants to do this to say goodbye to the family and spend time with the son before she leaves.The boy is Luke (Levi Miller). He seems a little bit timid, but he has a crush on Ashley. He knows tonight could be his last night to make his move. Garrett (Ed Oxenbould) is mocking him and we see that he might not be the best influence. Luke's parents are Robert (Patrick Warburton) and Deandra Lerner (Virginia Madsen). They are going off to a party that night and won't be back until late.Luke tries to make his move, but he is shot down by Ashley. He decides to pop open a bottle of champagne to show he is older. She is half paying attention to him as there are weird things happening outside. A pizza is delivered when they didn't order it. A Santa figure keeps moving, she keeps seeing a man outside and they are getting prank calls where no one is answering. It gets even worse when her tire gets slashed and a brick is thrown though an upstairs window with the message 'U Leave, U Die'. Like the synopsis states, this isn't your normal home invasion.When I had heard reviews of this film talking about not wanting to spoil this and it really takes a turn, I was trying to figure out what it could mean. It is really something you have to see. This film really has some solid writing. There were things that I noticed and they are pointed out. Those come back later in the film. It really has a twist that I didn't see coming. The depravity of it and the mean spirited of this film really had me on board.With saying that, I do think that it is a bit of stretch that everything in this film actually happening. I do have to give credit though, being able to think on your toes and the meticulous planning that would have to go into this is insane. What makes it even better though is the ending of the film. It made me think of the old adage, the best laid plans.The editing of the film is great. I never once got bored and I think a lot of that is the lower running time. This film really doesn't have any filler and I think that actually helps it. It moves at such a good pace. There were a few moments that I had were I was shocked what I saw. This film also needs credit for that. I really liked the ending of the film as well. I thought it was perfect.This film though really did need some good acting and I think we got that. It was interesting that DeJonge and Oxenbould appeared in the film The Visit together. In that they were siblings. This film DeJonge did a great job. She is in that weird place where she is only five years older than Luke. At the time in their life it is a giant gap. She is torn between being nice to him and needing to treat him like an adult. The things she endures in this film and her reactions help as well. Miller really steals the film though. His character from the beginning until the reveal is night and day. I thought it was a solid performance from some one that young. Oxenbould was fine as well in support. The rest of the cast for this film I thought were also good for what was needed.Next would be the effects of the film. To be honest, there isn't a lot in the way of effects. I give the film credit though, it seems like they were hiding a lot of it, which for me actually allowed my imagination to think of something probably worse than they would show. In films like this, if you can't make it look really good, then I say do what this film did. There was one scene I wanted to see, because of something that happens afterwards. The film is shot beautifully. The use of color at times also helps.Now with that said this film actually surprised me and exceeded my expectations for it. I had an idea coming in, but didn't expect what I got. The story is quite interesting and I like the turn at the beginning of the second act. The acting help to bring this life, which I thought was good. Miller kills his role for sure and I was quite impressed. There's not a lot in the way of effects and I did want a little bit more there. It was paced very well and I thought the ending was fitting for the film. The score didn't really stand out to me, aside from the father playing old Christmas music and during a tense scene later in the film as well. There are some sounds outside that are made to spook Ashley that were fine. Overall I would recommend seeing this film as I thought it was really good.",Better Watch Out

Just the premise of a home invasion is enough to make for a potentially good movie on its own, which is why it's basically an entire genre to itself. Adding a ""I'm going to seduce my babysitter"" on top of it makes it unique and interesting.Everything that happens past that is unpredictable, awesome, and refreshing.

All the technical stuff is good, and the first act is engaging and well paced - although maybe a bit too flat in its attempt to lure the audience in. But the thrills kick off with a twist at just the right point, and the gore and mayhem plays out in a well written screenplay with a clear climax and resolution.Plenty of quips and jokes, but they come off as mean spirited and I didn't laugh once. Yet the violence is almost all done with cutaways, with no sense of exploitation, and so it seems a bit polite, as if determined to avoid a high age-classification. The biggest complaint is with the music - constantly on, with hardly a pause for nerve-jangling silence, and it really is Nancy Drew cliché all the way. I guess we have a director/producer problem.The performances are good, especially those self-satisfied little dance moves - they reminded me of Michael Parks during his sermon in Red State.Overall: Good structure but didn't choose a single direction, and the music is unfknforgivable.",Better Watch Out

40,shakercoola,Better Watch..... paint dry,5,10 November 2018,"An American-Australian psychological horror; A story about a woman who travels to a suburban family to baby-sit their 12-year-old son but must soon defend herself and the young boy when unwelcome intruders announce their arrival. Like Funny Games (2007), this Christmas themed thriller aims for malicious behaviour as centre ground. It appeals to viewers' sense of darkhumour but goes straight to deep unpleasantness with no real explanation. While the Home Alone film reference about a paint pot may be dry humour for some, it may be in poor taste for others. All in all, it is at least watchable before it fudges a nasty, nihilistic, home invasion storyline.",Better Watch Out
41,arungeorge13,This home-invasion thriller is delightfully twisted! [+58%],6,9 October 2017,"'Better Watch Out' is a horror-comedy (well more of a 'dark thriller' and less of 'horror' in its conventional sense) directed by Chris Peckover (and co-written along with Zack Kahn), and revolves around unexpected incidents that take place during a routine baby-sitting at a silent suburban house.Deandra (Virginia Madsen) and Robert (Patrick Warburton) are headed out on Christmas night while a 17-year (or is it 18?) old Ashley (Olivia DeJonge) is summoned to babysit 12 year old Luke at their very 'Home-Alone looking' house (referenced ingeniously later on). Luke has a huge crush on Ashley and wants to bed her, but she politely rejects his advances as she's never observed him in that light. What starts off as a typical home-invasion thriller soon embraces a delightful twist (although I kind of saw that one coming) and turns the film on its head. The adolescent innocence that we perceived for the first half an hour is marvelously subverted as the movie begins to exhibit undercurrents of a dark, twisted thriller - one that makes you laugh as well, thanks to some insanely perverse ideas / questions that the protagonist (or antagonist?) wants to know clear-cut answers for.Two movies that immediately came to my mind were 'Knock Knock' and 'The Visit' - 'Knock Knock' for how well it utilizes the minimal setting to create something sinister, and 'The Visit' primarily because it features two of the same actors (DeJonge and Oxenbould) and is laced with enough moments of terror and laughter (two contrasting emotions). However, Peckover's movie has nothing in common with these films apart from what I've mentioned. It creates a wicked ambiance of its own and stands by it. The movie is an R-rated take on 'Home Alone', gleefully referencing it on a few occasions (needed more of that though!). It is quite difficult to review this film without discussing plot-points but it's best not to reveal them either. Peckover seems to have an eye for artsy imagery: a pencil stabbing, shots of paint and gore melding into each other, a sorry-note that makes us momentarily root for a dead ex-boyfriend.It's the uniformly even performances from the three main characters that holds the film together. Garrett is the one whom the viewer can principally relate to: he is manipulated into doing things for his supposed best-friend; he's just looking to have some creepy teenage fun but his friend has bigger, more sadistic intentions. Luke is safe in Levi Miller's hands - he makes you want his face to be wiped off planet Earth for his actions, but ultimately he's a kid seeking answers to sexual repression. The rationality of some of the scenes is certainly contentious but 'Better Watch Out' is unarguably entertaining in its 88 minute run-time. The climax is also slickly done, leaving the audience with a smirk on their faces.Verdict: An entertaining diversion from the usual home-invasion flicks!",Better Watch Out
42,michaeltrivedi,Delightful Treat,7,11 November 2019,"Here's a delightful treat for horror fans out there. I do not necessarily like the horror/humor genre, but I do like Christmas-y horror movies. It reminds me of Shining and Eyes Wide Shut, though this one is far, far from those. But it's a good one.The story is about a babysitter who is hired for the night to watch a young boy. The boy has a crush on this babysitter, and enlists the help of his friend to stage a robbery, hoping to grow closer to her. The robbery is discovered, and the two boys tie her up to a chair. They then call the girls boyfriend and ex-boyfriend, before killing them. Then the friend dies. And then supposedly the kid kills the babysitter.It's an actually well made movie for the following reason. One, is that you don't know what to expect in terms of the story. You think it's a home invasion movie, and turns into a movie about a sick, demented boy, who covers it all with a nice boy act. Second, you don't expect the kid to possibly win, because most times the killer doesn't get away in horror movies.Lastly, the movie is just well made. It's funny and relatable. The cast is alright. And the feeling and atmosphere is nice. Watch it if you want, it's a good treat.7 stars",Better Watch Out

44,MrGKB,Approach this one as an E.C. Comic writ large...,7,4 November 2018,"...and you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for too much realism or an airtight plot, you look in vain. Despite characters that are mostly paper thin, the actors rise above with enough authority to satisfy all but the most jaded audiences. As well, the production design, cinematography, and so forth stretch its relatively low budget to maximum effect. No, this isn't on a level with Michael Haneke's unsettling ""Funny Games"" or its American remake; think of it more as a John Hughesian teen comedy that takes a dark turn into violent absurdity. It truly is a comic book potboiler in the vein of ""Tales From the Crypt,"" crude tongue wedged in its cheek, nonsensical plot devices on full display. I understand fully why so many wags here hated it, but despite its flaws, I had fun with its earnest attempt to offer up its twisted take on teen angst.

46,rockman182,Better Watch Out (2017),7,19 June 2019,"Well its definitely not the time of the year for this type of film but my local library finally got Bluray's so why not? I did want to see this but admittedly didn't know a whole lot about it. i think if you go in not having seen the trailer you are in for a very good ride. This one is cliched and has a lack of events I guess but its such a super fun movie and one of the better holiday themed horror films I've seen.The film is about a babysitter who takes care of a twelve year old as she normally does. He has a crush on his babysitter and soon over a night of trying for her affection, she founds out that the kid is absolutely deranged and he holds her hostage as he attempts to act out his psychopathic tendencies. All this, set within the time frame of the holiday season. The film stars Olivia DeJonge and Levi Miller.The film has violent events but shies away from showing the bloody moments. Levi Miller does a great job as a villainous little twerp. You will absolutely despise this kid and its a testament to how good he portrays his character. The film kind of hits the notes of what you would see in a horror film of the sort but the fact that it veered towards being more of a dark comedy is what makes it stand out for me.I don't know if other people will like this as much as I did. Maybe I was just really in the mood to experience a holiday themed horror in the dead of summer. I think the cast really do a good job of carrying the film and if you don't know about the twist that the trailer shows its even better (which was the case for me). I like these niche horror films, it excelled in what it needed to do and was a cracking good time.7.5/10",Better Watch Out

49,kjproulx,A Twisted Good Time For A Specific Audience,8,29 October 2017,"To be perfectly honest, it's very rare that a film is able to keep a secret from its audience without them guessing it earlier. Nearly everything has been done numerous times throughout cinema, so the element of surprise is sadly lost throughout the majority of film these days. Better Watch Out is a film that finds a way to differentiate itself from the predictable, becoming one of the most enjoyable horror films I've seen in a while. Although I'm going to pretty much praise this movie from start to finish, it's not for everyone. In fact, this movie will probably only please a very small audience, so this is going to dive into the movie itself and what makes it good, rather than gushing about how awesome it may be, which will inevitably let quite a few people down. Here are my thoughts on why Better Watch Out is a great addition to the horror genre, and why many viewers should be wary before viewing.We've seen films about kids who think their babysitters are beautiful and have an insanely large crush on them. It makes for some good comedy, so I'm surprised that more films haven't used that as a plot point, but that's not really what this movie is about. Quite honestly, the plot itself is a spoiler, so I'll keep it simple by saying that young Luke is left home alone with his babysitter and before you know it, everything you think you know is false and things really start to hit the fan quickly. Better Watch Out maintains a pace that will satisfy many viewers, but the plot of this movie will most likely anger certain audience members. I found myself cringing at certain elements, wondering how I could possibly be enjoying what was unfolding in front of my eyes, but this movie is made in such a way that just ends up being applaudable.Most people who view horror films are ready for anything, or at least should be. In terms of restricted horror movies, you should be well aware that there will be some scenes involving some pretty risqué scenery. From children swearing, to visible murder, Better Watch Out (although very restrained) goes for quite a few gutsy actions. Like all horror films, you should be ready for anything, but in terms of what's shown on-screen, this movie really doesn't overdo it in terms of gore. There are films that rely on gore to sell the movie, but Better Watch Out only shows it when the story requires it to, which was a nice change of pace in comparison with the majority of horror films nowadays. With the combination of restrained gore and the addition of solid cast, I can see horror fans getting a kick out of this movie. Starring Olivia DeJonge and Levi Miller, these to performers played off of each other in a fantastic way. I found myself believing most of everything they were saying to each other, even if there are admittedly some pretty cheesy lines of dialogue (but I think that was intentional). Levi Miller's portrayal of Luke is something that will always annoy me because the character himself is crazy, to say the least. Although these two leads were great, the standout to me wasEd Oxenbould. The best friend of Luke and the much more mature one of the two young boys, his character is truly the one to connect to when having to follow these lead characters. This film is strange when it comes to its characters though, because the ones you truly care about are the ones that hardly get any screen time. I don't think I've said that about another movie all year, so at least it went for something different.In the end, Better Watch Out is a little too cheeky to be called a horror classic in the years to come, but I can see a cult following for this film continuously building through the years. I had a blast watching this movie from start to finish. You may hate yourself for sitting through certain things and just having to be okay with it, but this is something very different than anything that a mainstream horror film would have the guts to do. If you're up for anything and can follow characters whether or not you have to accept that they're either good or bad people, then I can't recommend this movie enough. It's a fun watch on either Halloween or Christmas, so that's another plus. This is a really solid horror flick that goes from zero to ten in a matter of seconds and it's a great result as a final product.",Better Watch Out
50,kuarinofu,Disappointing,5,30 April 2018,"This movie is a mix of genres and situations. This is probably a good idea on paper, but in reality it doesn't work so well. At least it didn't for me. 
The are two important milestones you have to survive, 20 min and 40 min mark. If the movie has passed the 40 min mark and you are still watching, you are probably interested in what it is going to throw at you next. I can assure you, nothing interesting is going to happen. You know how it's going to end.
I can probably see some people enjoying this, but as for me, this didn't work at all. And I'm not talking about the details, more about the overall concept.

53,LloydBayer,Better Watch Out is a year-end treat to horror fans who have seen it all before.,8,7 December 2017,"One of the biggest challenges for a horror film writer is to conceive ways to scare the audience, especially when everyone thinks they have seen it all before. Last year's Don't Breathe was one such example of reinventing the horror-thriller, and all on a shoestring budget. Subverting the genre even further, 2017's Get Out took innovation to another level with its slow burn but thoroughly unsettling atmosphere in a narrative that is both shocking and satirical. For a pitch black horror thriller masquerading as a home invasion film, Better Watch Out is a different breed of horror and perhaps the most predatory of them all.Using the grand but acquired art of deception, writer Zack Kahn and co-writer/director Chris Peckover gives this film a spectacular spin on its head, but not before opening with the now standard home invasion premise. As such, the film begins on familiar ground with jump scares that seem too deliberate and even contrived. This is just the smoke screen in place to conceal an early twist in the story that gets dark and even more twisted. And before long, we the audience get knocked around like limp passengers in the backseat of a vehicle taking sharp turns.Most viewers won't even realise that the white Christmas setting of a typical American suburb was actually shot in Sydney, Australia. Or that the three lead actors, with their perfect American accents are also Australian. Their delivery is the real reason to recommend this film, but to avoid spoilers, I'll just say that the transformation of some of these characters – from doe-eyed cuteness to downright pathological – is remarkable for virtually unknown actors.At its lightest level, Better Watch Out can be perceived as a caricature of the Home Alone films. Is it scary? It's hard to answer that question without revealing a crucial twist but during all the ensuing mayhem, Peckover's triumph are the comic interjections that make some of the goriest scenes unexpectedly funny. And yet at its scariest, the writing, and the narrative, are grounded towards director Michael Haneke's psychological thriller Funny Games. Anyone who has seen that film can survive this film. For horror fans who like it dark, clever and twisted, this is the ultimate year-end treat at the cinema whether you've been naughty or nice.",Better Watch Out

55,coreyjdenford,Bloody Wintry Wonder,8,8 December 2017,"This review of Better Watch Out is spoiler free**** (4/5)IN HOME ALONE Macauley Culkin's Kevin McCallister had a sweet and innocent look to him he was well behaved with his parents and he had a huge heart, but in his core there was something slightly monstrous which would come into full power when two burglars came prowling near his colonial home. And in the end Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern would be hit by all sorts of household materials. In writer-director Chris Peckover's second feature Better Watch Out he goes down the same road, it's essentially that infamous scene where Kevin would throw a paint can over a balcony and hit the two burglars in the face in a comical manor. Here the premise is derange and a more hardcore version of the yuletide family classic. Watch out.Simply set-up by opening on a particularly normal Christmas Eve night when teenager Ashley (Olivia DeJonge) travels to the suburban home of the Lerners to baby-sit their 12-year-old son Luke (Levi Miller) while they enjoy a quiet evening out, for a while it's a quiet night for the two until a stranger comes prowling around so she must fight to protect him and herself from. What happens next is a sensational twist to switch the premise from a warm yuletide drama to deranged yuletide nastiness as Luke's monstrous side comes into full power and still maintaining the gimmick as a gift-wrapped home invasion tickler than rather an unlocked version of The Strangers yet this doesn't mean that it's lacking in the creepy side of Michael Haneke's, Funny Games (you could include the English-language remake too). In fact, quite the contrary because Peckover's strengths all hinge on surprising elements resulting in shocks that aren't for the faint hearted, the classic Home Alone paint scene is reinvented ""Are you f*cking Home Aloneing him?"" Luke's friend Garrett (Ed Oxenbould) asks before the less Tom and Jerry comic violence and more of a psychotic impact. (You were warned).Much like Culkin in 1990's festive family classic, Australian actor Miller's confident performance as both sides of Luke is excellent, he shows commitment to making this child as demonic as possible he certainly earns no negative points. Peckover shows that he isn't a stranger to the horror genre as he's a dab hand to orchestrating a few jump scares scattered throughout, also he efficiently cranks the suspension up to 11, meanwhile making sure that the character work remains at the film's core. Better Watch Out is deranged, monstrous entertainment and breathes new life into the festive horror subgenre.VERDICT A potently f*cked up ho-ho-home invasion thriller with a truly sensational twist for good old wintry entertainment that's the fun kind of nasty.",Better Watch Out

57,zac-04879,A Wicked Surprise,8,10 October 2021,"Ridiculously twisted, darkly hilarious and frequently shocking, Better Watch Out is the Christmas-themed dark comedy a horror fan must see on the holidays. It's exceedingly fast-moving, entertaining, well-crafted and will set your blood on fiery infuriation. It heavily focuses on suspenseful intelligence and cruel manipulation between appealing teenage characters, a babysitters, a boyfriend, a friend and a wicked child.Chris Peckover fabulously executes a grotesquely delightful holiday-horror-comedy, which he cleverly co-wrote with Zack Kahn. The execution is beyond perfect. The 89 minutes are super fast and are guiltily pleasurable. It's funny, gripping and smart, with lots of twists and turns.There's not too much to say without completely spoiling the story; the best that can be said is it's pure entertainment and the blood-boiling twists all end in satisfaction. Thankfully, the ending of this hideous plot is satisfying, at least if you ignore the sequel-begging credits scene. We need another fun sequel for this idea to continue. It probably wouldn't involve the home-invasion-like theme, but would need to be satisfying, smart and super.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Better Watch Out

Starts with some promise but eventually deteriorates into silly scenarios and pathetic sequences. The kid playing the lead is thoroughly annoying.

60,meathookcinema,Good but could have been great,4,11 December 2017,"A movie that goes one way but changes direction massively.In fact before the plot twist that occurs I thought this was a film about the most unlikable and privileged kids I'd ever seen on screen. In fact they're so privileged that when they got to college they would be the biggest social justice warriors, I thought as I drifted away from the dull film. In fact the only tension or frisson in the first half hour was more centred around the couple next to me who kept talking throughout the film. They stopped after I suddenly shrieked 'For f*cks sake! Shut the f*ck up!'But then the film has a huge volte face regarding its plot and it touches upon something that is still taboo in real life and on film- killers who are children. In fact, as soon as the film started to touch upon this film I instantly thought of the case of James Bulger. I was genuinely shocked to see the use of a can of paint in the film. Anyone who knows about the proceedings of Bulger's death will know that paint figures predominantly. Was this coincidental or intentional?The film could have now developed into something much darker, brutal and savage. It doesn't exploit this brilliant plot twist and is a bit too obsessed with gloss rather than grit. The last 15 minutes are extremely contrived and more Hollywood than horrorshow. This is a shame. The very end of the film is funny but this should have been a vivid display of gallows humour rather than a jokey conclusion to a good but not great movie.A wasted opportunity. But not a failure- in this era of reboots and reboots (the curse of modern film), any trace of originality and innovation should be cherished. If you want to see a much better 'killer kids' film watch Bloody Birthday. The best Christmas horror films are still Black Christmas, Silent Night, Deadly Night and Christmas Evil. If you want to watch a movie about vapid, overprivileged kids, you're asking the wrong person.",Better Watch Out

The trailer set it up as a home invasion thriller, and while it technically was, the writers revealed their cards much too early and thus ruined what could have been an otherwise great film. The writing, in fact, although attempting to be clever is juvenile and ridiculous. When you find out what's really going on, it implores you to roll your eyes and groan at the fact that you've invested any time at all into such a dumb plot. And though it claims to be a ""horror/thriller"", it was either dumbed down for younger audiences or chopped to death in editing because much of the violence, in fact, occurs OFF CAMERA.If you're looking for a good holiday thriller, this is not the one.

I'm no horror film 'expert' but out of the box we have Luke, every bit the essence of a 12 year old Ferris Beuller with a super crush on his long time baby sitter Ashley. There are peripheral characters like Lukes best friend and Ashley's ex boyfriends. The film starts off with a potentially fatal home invasion by an armed, menacing intruder. Sound is used throughout in ways not often seen and so effective for 'jolts' to the viewers. As many have said, stick with the movie for at least 30 minutes to get an idea of just how much of an original and twisted journey lies ahead.The two lead actors, Luke and Ashley do an excellent job. Luke in particular carries this film and has us believing just how 'sincere' he is in his quest to move his Ashley 'crush' to the next step. Post viewing the film I found myself replaying its first major twist. So original and jolting. Truly, for me a unique, original, well acted and fun horror ride.

The first killing doesn't even go for the obvious gross-out factor just to up the bloodiness, which you'd expect a horror movie to do.

Unfortunately for him, she is 5 years older than him and has a boyfriend named Ricky. One night while his parents are out to dinner, Ashley comes over to look after him which he is clearly very excited about. As the night goes on, it appears that burglars have broken into the house, but that isn't the only thing that Ashley will have to be afraid of ...I enjoyed Better Watch Out the first time I saw it. It had all the wonderful makings of a successful Christmas horror movie. It took a lot of classic moments from Christmas movies made over the years (especially Home Alone) and turned it into total horror carnage. The film tried to trick viewers with the direction that the film was going in early on, but it was a very obvious mystery for me to solve early on. That may be the weakest point. I wouldn't say that Better Watch Out was terrifying, it relied a lot on intense action sequences and great dark comedy in dialogue.Two of the strongest points of this movie were the script and the acting, which kind of went hand in hand. I thought the dialogue on the young kids (Luke and Garrett) was modern enough and made sense for the times. It made the two child actors come across as real and fleshed out characters. Levi Miller was remarkable in the devious lead role of Luke who had the task of leading the way in the house invasion scheme and eventual hostage taking of the babysitter Ashley who he was obsessed with. The babysitter role of Ashley was played by Olivia DeJonge and she knocked the hell out of the final girl character.Better Watch Out was like a grown up horror version of 'Home Alone' for me, and it worked.7/10",Better Watch Out

Now, it's impossible to write about this movie without giving much away, so I'll just keep it brief. The movie takes place in a suburban setting and is about a Babysitter and the kid she's looking after where they are home alone and some intruders appear. Now, what I liked most about this movie is that it pretty much keeps you guessing or wondering about what'll happen till the very end. It's a short movie and it keeps you entertained. Small budget but well produced. The acting was good by pretty much everyone. There is cringe, but it's definitely intentional and the movie uses that to its advantage, provided that you're on board. If you're not, you'll be annoyed. There is some lazy/stupid writing and I wish the movie had more balls in certain scenes, would have definitely made it a better experience for me. All in all, I didn't know what to expect exactly but it was a surprisingly entertaining flick. I had a good time with it. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it 7-7.5/10.

The trailer might be very misleading for a lot of people, because this isn't your typical ""Home Invasion movie, it has so many twists and turns that it could lead to disappointment for some, but for others it could really impress and for me it really impressed. It's told in a very ""Home Alone"" kind of style except this isn't a Family Movie. It takes a lot of the old movie clichés and makes it into its own original movie.As soon as the real plot begins (within the first 30 mins) it starts taking a brand new dark turn into the Horror Genre. It is quite thrilling and gripping to say the least. Luke (played by Levi Miller) has a crush on his babysitter and will do all kind of sick and twisted games in order to impress his babysitter Ashley (played by Olivia DeJonge). His accomplice Garrett (played by Ed Oxenbould) will do anything his friend Luke says, because all Garrett really wants is a friend, and he will go and do anything Luke tells him to do, despite the fact he isn't as mental and twisted as Luke is.All in all the acting is fine, the real stand out here is Levi Miller, he plays a very disturbed kid really well. Olivia DeJonge is another good actress here, she plays her part well and Ed Oxenbould is good as always. It's always good to see Oxenbould and DeJonge reunite ever since their last film ""The Visit.""

Chris Peckover's direction was just average. Austrilian beauty Olivia DeJonge did some really good job thorough out the movie. She looks cute, scared and spirited altogether. Music from Brian Cachia and Cinematography from Carl Robertson were just average.

96,thelastblogontheleft,A fun film with a few twists!,6,27 December 2017,"Better Watch Out (originally titled Safe Neighborhood) is Canadian-Australian director Chris Peckover's second film after 2010's Undocumented (which is absolutely on my to-watch list now). It was an ambitious project considering the budget was low enough that they couldn't afford to air condition the set despite shooting in Australia's high summer heat, and yet the settings are impressive and the cast is even more so.It opens with teenager Ashley (Olivia DeJonge) heading to one last babysitting gig before she moves out of state. As the parents (Virginia Madsen and Patrick Warburton, who I wish could have been on-screen longer) head out, 12-year-old Luke (Levi Miller) quickly gets comfortable trying to convince Ashley that age is just a number when it comes to romance. But he only has time for a few awkward (and rejected) passes before they suspect that someone is lurking inside the house, though the reality is something far more sinister...** SPOILERS! **I thought this was a surprisingly smart and engaging movie. I only say ""surprisingly"" because I generally don't have super high hopes for pre-teen or teenage-centric movies of recent years, but I should probably let go of that stereotype considering how much I've been impressed by the kids in It and Stranger Things, proving that age really IS just a number.The only thing I really didn't care much for was the music. It has the requisite Christmas songs interspersed, but the rest of the music I felt was just a bit too... unimpressive? Expected? It wasn't distracting, but it didn't stand out to me either.But the acting was solid all the way around. Even Virginia Madsen and Patrick Warburton - who are only on screen for maybe 10 minutes total - were great (no surprise there). Everyone was believable, and I thought Luke Miller did a great job at playing this character that is sort of a yet-to-be-polished villain. The evil intent is there, and it's disturbing to see, but he's still a kid in many ways (evidenced by the sheer number of times his voice squeaks throughout the film), which felt very purposeful on his part. I was also reminded of how much I like Dacre Montgomery (who you probably know as Billy Hargrove from Stranger Things 2), and I was a bit blown away to see that he's only 23.I think what impressed me the most was how smart the script was. I was disappointed seeing the plot go towards what seemed like your standard home invasion movie. There's only so much you can do with that type of scenario and they made so many typical mistakes in the short time we're under that pretense that I thought it might be hopeless. But when we get the first twist of the movie out of the way, it turns into something much more complex.It ends up being a movie focused much more on how insidious toxic masculinity and entitlement can be. Luke's advances on Ashley at first seem inappropriate but harmless - just a kid with a crush. When she admonishes him for his prank (and tells him he needs therapy, which winds up being much more accurate than it seems at first), you see a glimmer of something more than just disappointment in his eyes - something closer to hate - but you pass it off as him having his dreams crushed and feeling embarrassed. But as the movie progresses and we see what he's really capable of, you see how much of a sociopath he really is. These little stories told throughout to demonstrate how innocent and normal he is - him accidentally killing his best friend Garrett's hamster and crying about it, for example - all turn out to be masterminded and played out intentionally by him. It's a reminder of how there's never a guarantee that anyone is as they seem.Luke is territorial (""she's MY babysitter - you don't touch her""), manipulative, coercive, and ultimately without much feeling aside from exhilaration at his own capability for violence (his victory dance after first whacking Ricky with a baseball bat, or his exclamation of ""his head just exploded!"" after proving his Home Alone theory with a can of yellow paint). The most disturbing part of the movie is how we see what looks like a prank-gone-wrong, with Luke scrambling to save face, turn into what it really is: a well-oiled machine, with all of the parts set in place intentionally and diabolically.But again, we always have this juxtaposition of malicious intent beyond his years paired with reminders of just how youthful he actually is, which only serves to highlight the tragedy of such casual violence. Garrett reminding Luke that he still needs his help with a school paper due on Monday, Ricky having no difficulty prying the bat away from him, Luke scolding Garrett for smoking pot in the house because ""my mom will kill me!""... he's still a kid despite his horrific acts. Which makes him quite a bit more scary - he's not threatening because he has supernatural powers or even because he has size and strength on his side. He's threatening because he just doesn't care. Him shooting Garrett was probably the most shocking for me - cutting off Garrett's plea of ""I want my mom"" with a gunshot to the head was basically the definition of indifference.I also loved the twist at the end. As much as he planned out every single detail, and cheerfully danced around prepping the house for his parents' arrival, he didn't count on Ashley being one step ahead.Smart and fun, definitely worth a watch!",Better Watch Out
97,GreyHunter,Umm...comedy?,5,24 August 2020,"I won't complain about the basic plot elements -- it was poorly set up with little thematic follow-through to give it a sense of unity to the characterizations, but the plot elements are entirely the business of the director and writer. You either accept them or you don't. But I will complain about the lack of comedy. I love horror-comedies. I love dark comedies. Pitch-black ones. But other than some awkwardness that just makes you cringe rather than chuckle, I didn't see any comedy here. So we're supposed to be amused by some 12 year old being a horny inexperienced 12 year old? By bickering parents? By...recreation of a scene from an actual comedy? It's not in any way clear where the filmmakers thought the comedy lay in the darkness of the plot. And the depiction of psychopathy was, as I said earlier, poorly set up and poorly followed through. It wasn't believable...which would have been excusable in a dark comedy. But when there's no comedy to be found, that just accentuates the multitude of issues with the movie and its characters.It's not a *terrible* movie, and the acting is okay (though I'm profoundly disappointed that Patrick Warburton wasn't utilized to the fullness of his comedic talents.) The pretty blonde babysitter-type showed depth and some talent over the usual horror movie trope. But that really couldn't save a poorly-constructed plot.Also, I kinda hated that mid-closing credits scene. It just reminded me of how the movie was over-the-top and difficult to believe without actually managing to make it into black comedy territory. Instead of finding it amusing, all I could think was that she's conscious and there's no way he get a chance alone with her before she could tell the doctors and cops everything. In a black comedy, I could overlook that bit of logic because black comedies have their own sorts of logic. Here? Nope.",Better Watch Out
98,jcslawyer,"Messed up, but great fun",8,4 May 2020,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I had no idea what to expect going into it...other than it being a home invasion movie, but with a babysitter and some kids.I did not see that twist coming. I had an idea something was up with Lucas, but just thought he was an awkward, creepy kid.Plot is pretty simple. Parents going to a Christmas party. Babysitter comes over. Teenage boy plans to woo her since he's into her. The night starts out a little weird since he keeps making cringeworthy passes at her, even going so far as to put his hand on her thigh then go in for a kiss. Then things start getting weird as it seems like someone's lurking outside. Eventually someone enters and there's a game of cat and mouse with the girl, Ashley, and Lucas hiding from the burglar. When hiding in a closet, Ashley notices that the burglar is wearing Lucas' snow hat/mask and calls him out. It ends up being Lucas' friend Garrett and it's revealed they wanted to play a prank on her....at least that's what Garrett thought. After Ashley berates Lucas, he slaps her causing her to tumble down the stairs. Next thing you know, she's tied up and it's revealed that Lucas is crazy and had more in store than we all thought.Things get even more messed up from there. A current boyfriend comes over and after some taunting is killed by the infamous Home Alone paint can thing. Gross. Then an ex bf comes over under the impression that she wants him yo apologize. But he is killed by Lucas who hangs him using a noose connected to a lawn mower. After Lucas realizes that Garrett is helping Ashley (since Garrett had no idea things were gonna go this far), he shoots Garrett and kills him. He then seemingly kills Ashley.Lucas proceeds to set up everything to look like a murder suicide with the ex bf, and puts himself to bed taking his nightly sedative so when the parents come home, he acts as if he slept thru it all. While the police investigate it is revealed Ashley survived and is being taken to the hospital. In a mid-credit scene, Lucas says to his mom that they should visit her in the hospital.Excellent suspense, pretty decent acting, gross out violence and a great twist. Although it's a dark comedy, you won't want to stop watching.",Better Watch Out

The script was reasonably tight and the acting from the three main characters,(all Australian actors),was extremely good,Ashley (Olivia DeJonge ) is a great actress and very easy on the eye to look at,Luke (Levi Miller),did a very convincing job as the little psycho ratbag as did Garret (Ed Oxenbould ) who played the part of the easily manipulated best friend.I will definatly give this movie a second viewing and give it a solid 8.",Better Watch Out
102,A_Llama_Drama,Warning: May Leave You With Whiplash,8,16 April 2018,"Found this on Netflix, having no prior knowledge of what it was about, I saw that two of the leads from ""The Visit,"" who I thought did well in an otherwise mediocre film, were starring. So, with little expectation, and fully prepared to switch to Archer at a moment's notice, I turned it on. Better Watch Out lies about everything. I don't even think the name is appropriate for the title. That title conjures up ideas of Santa Claus going on a rampage, or clueless teens getting their comeuppance for past transgressions. Bizarrely, Better Watch Out, upon finishing the film, I noticed, doesn't actually even try to hide what is about to transpire and that's what makes it so good. Young Ashley is about to go off to college and takes on one last night of babysitting her favourite charge, Luke. Unbeknownst to Ashley, Luke and his best friend, Garrett, have planned to get Luke laid in the most immature way possible (seduce the babysitter with a horror movie and some moet chandon). Not only that, but her current beau is picking fights with her over the phone and her ex has been spreading some vicious rumours. She's in for a rough night. Things get far worse when she receives prank calls, and before you can say ""When a Stranger Calls,"" she and Luke are running for their lives, trying to evade a psycho whose motive remains completely absent, but makes good on his threat to kill anyone who leaves the house. At this point, I was prepared to continue for the cast, only, because all three leads are adorable and cute, even as the situation becomes stale and predictable. Then, and I can't stress this enough, things got switched up. Things, which already seemed pretty bad, get worse in a way that is so difficult to comprehend, I spent a good 20 minutes trying to figure out what sort of film I was actually watching. What appears to be an innocent act quickly spirals into one of utter depravity and filth, something I've not seen, ever, in a mainstream horror. Even as my brain was trying to catch up, I kept thinking ""Surely this is a mistake, things can be fixed, right?""Better Watch Out pays homage to a vast variety of horror directors, from Michael Hanneke to Joe Dante. There's a cloyingly sweet Home Alone feel to the proceedings, with a very real reference to that movie's take on self-defense,, that may ruin further viewing of Home Alone at Christmas for any viewer with a queasy stomach. Even as the leads are crumbling to violence and horror, it's hard not to watch them, they're that good. Even the supporting cast give layered performances (Luke's mother and father are comic relief, but there are cracks under the suburban happiness) and not since ""Orphan"" have I seen a child actor carry a horror on their shoulders.There are some misgivings. I found it hard to believe the complicity involving certain characters, and I assume that it is just their way of coping with trauma, but I didn't believe that there'd be as much support for what occurs between those stuck in the house. Furthermore, two of the main cast are playing 12 year olds which is disturbing enough as it is, yet is further compounded by the fact the babysitter looks younger than them. It's difficult to believe there'd be such penchant for violence (physical, sexual, emotional and mental) against and perpetrated by 12 year olds.Thankfully, the whole thing moves so fast that you barely have time to register one horrific reveal before another nasty, twisted little cut has been inflicted. It's a marvel for horror fans and, for me, will be an excellent addition to my annual christmas horror show!",Better Watch Out
103,shannen-l-c,Mixed bag,5,11 July 2018,"'Better Watch Out' has a lot of promise and benefits from good performances from the main cast. It starts out particularly good and the suspense is built up well, but the plot is predictable (I correctly guessed it 15 minutes into the movie) and given away much too early. There is no real plot and usually in a horror or thriller of this sort I'd expect the stakes and anti to be built up more and more as the movie progresses, but that didn't happen. It felt incredibly stagnant and predictable. For horror fans looking for a true horror, I would say this may not be for you. I, for one, was expecting a lot more violence and gore, but most of the violence was mild or took place off camera. It's much more aimed at young teens and/or people that have a preference to thrillers rather than horrors. Although the movie generally fell flat for me, I enjoyed the ending and think the idea was a good one that would've made for an excellent movie if it had been executed differently.",Better Watch Out

Take, for example, ""squirrelly."" This is a film which, intentionally or not, makes the viewer feel squirrelly. Not horrified or shocked or squeamish or even, unfortunately, entertained. Squirrelly. Which, in turn, makes this genre-busting exercise in unpredictability more of a one-hit wonder than the beginning of a trend.Twenty year old Olivia deJong (playing younger) is incredibly photogenic. Try as she might to overcome that genetic attribute with actual acting, she fails to pull it off. Peckover knew this of course when he first cast her, and the extra time the camera spends doting on deJong is, trust me, no accident.The real surprise is 16 year old Levi Miller who amazingly looks and acts like a young Robert Patrick (Terminator) -- which basically means that, long after this film is forgotten, Miller will still have a heck of a career ahead of him.",Better Watch Out

It has some great twists and turns in it and keeps you guessing.The lead role was brilliantly played and I wont mention who that is as that might spoil it but the main 'baddy' in this is fantastic and so unexpected to what you would normally have in these kind of movies. No sinister masks are used in this movie like scream etc and this kind of in your face evil makes it even more disturbing Another good point is that this movie has no real gore. There is no gore and guts added just for the sake of it and even times when they could have gone down that route it was avoided and that is a great subtle touch as in one scene your mind fills in the picture for you and no amount of CGI can compare with imagination.On the whole a very enjoyable tense movie that has no real gore but loads of thrills and spills and really grabs you and wont let go until the end,Better Watch Out

All members of the cast are fine, they can make everybody laugh or hate them.However, in my opinion there are 2 problems: One is detailed in the spoiler section and the other one is the lack of gore. I was expecting to watch more bloody scenes instead off-screen deaths, because sometimes I thought I was watching a nice PG-13 movie.WARNING, BE CAREFUL WITH THE SPOILERS: - - - The other biggest problem in Better Watch Out is the ending, in my opinion, I would love to see the main girl revenging against Luke after the final twist (after the police says she's alive).

I really wanted more, I wanted to see a final act, the little boy going to an asylum or dying. - - - ENDING OF THE SPOILERSIt's fresh, smart, funny and thrilling, but the lack of bloody scenes and the weak 3rd act cause some difficulty for the film to become a classic in the horror genre...

Have you ever seen that cringy video of a guy with makeup doing his best impression of Heath Ledger's Joker, only to be caught by his roommate? This movie is like watching that, but for 90 minutes. This movie feels like some 20-years-too-early audition tape for Miller's own Joker movie.

I mean I get it. All kids are fairly embarrassing at some stage in their lives. I sure was. But my God, this is beyond anything I could have imagined.I feel bad for everyone involved with this movie. Sure there was some moments of outright terrible acting by Olivia DeJonge, but surely she doesn't deserve to star in this pile of garbage. Replacing Miller with someone that wasn't completely laughable wouldn't even solve the problem though. This film is also riddled with the most clichéd and tired tropes, not to mention the countless moments of stupidity acted out by our incapable protagonist. It's hard to watch in almost every way. The production value is decent though, so I guess it's not as bad as it could've been.Do I recommend this movie? Please don't bother. It's not even funny bad, it's just embarrassing.

Garrett insists that Ashley is much too old to be interested in Luke, but Luke wants to try anyway. When Ashley arrives, Deandra and Robert leave, confident that all will go well while they're out at a holiday party, since she's been their usual babysitter for years.Following his ridiculous Internet-inspired plan Luke suggests watching a horror movie with Ashley. They settle in front of the television. But soon strange things start to happen. A lighted Santa Claus figure moves. There are strange phone calls. Are they just scaring themselves because they're watching a scary movie? Or are outside events starting to get even scarier than the movie? Will Ashley's boyfriend Ricky or her ex-boyfriend Jeremy save the day?I sometimes like horror movies, including serious films like _Rosemary's Baby_ and _The Shining_, and horror comedies such as _Black Sheep_ and _Fido_. But I'm pretty picky, and I don't care for slasher movies, torture porn, and the like. But this movie aspired to be a horror comedy, so I stuck around in hopes of something like Black Sheep. No such luck.I can't properly describe what's so bad about the story and screenplay without spoilers, except to say that a major character had at least one huge change in motives.There are plenty of implausible elements in the story, but most fall within the range of creative license for a horror movie. However, the giant plot hole I describe in the spoilers (below) is a fatal flaw. I rate the story and screenplay poor.The directing is somewhat better. The scenes are well staged, it makes good use of color, and sometimes the film even have a degree of suspense. But it fails on the comedy side; the only humor is in the cheerful Christmas music, a joke that wears out very quickly. I rate the directing almost good.The acting is also pretty respectable. Madsen and Warburton are good in their small roles. DeJonge is good in her leading role. Miller is good in his leading role, in spite of what the story gives him. Oxenbould is fair as the geeky friend, and directing may be partly to blame for his shortcomings. Mikic is almost good and Montgomery good in their small roles. Bit players (carolers) are fair, but directing may be to blame for their weakness.Overall, I rate the film poor; the faults of the story overwhelm all the things about the film that are adequate.(This review is adapted from my own film journal.)- -Lots of spoilers begin here:At the beginning of the film, Luke is established as a horny adolescent with a ridiculously juvenile plan to seduce Ashley. But the scary events outside are an elaborate plot he has orchestrated, with the aid of Garrett. They simulate a home invasion, and get out one of Robert's poorly-secured guns to defend against the fake invader. He disables the household Internet and tricks Ashley into losing her phone. Although Ashley is justifiably terrified, she's still not interested in sex with Luke. The underage drinking they indulge in doesn't help with the seduction either.Later, Garrett has second thoughts about the dangerous mischief, and tries to talk Luke out of it, particularly after Luke drugs Ashley and duct tapes her to an armchair. Luke persists, and threatens to reveal the champagne consumption. She still refuses to let him fondle her breasts, so he fondles her anyway.Suddenly, Luke's motives change from sexually abusing Ashley to murder. He texts her boyfriend Ricky and ex-boyfriend Jeremy to lure them to the house, manages to subdue Ricky and tape him into another armchair, subdues Jeremy and blackmails him into writing a letter of apologies. Then the murders start: he kills Ricky with a heavy bucket of paint, hangs Jeremy from a tree in a staged suicide, kills Garrett with a shotgun, stabs Ashley in the neck, and then rubs all the murder weapons on Jeremy's hands. (He apologizes to Garrett as he kills him.) Then he slips into bed.The only clue that Luke might have had secret murderous thoughts is that he eventually reveals that he once murdered Garrett's pet hamster. If the film had foreshadowed his dark side, such as by having the parents thank Ashley for being the only babysitter who could deal with Luke, his change in motive from sex to murder might have made sense. I still would have disliked the movie, but the giant, fatal (pun intended) plot hole would have been resolved.Later the parents return and discover the murders. Luke, upstairs pretending to be asleep, rouses at the screams. Police and emergency crews arrive, and discover that Ashley isn't quite dead, and rush her to the hospital. Maybe Luke won't get away with it after all.",Better Watch Out
127,jadediamond,A Nice Unexpected Twist,9,9 August 2020,"I've been passing up this Christmas horror movie for a while and finally decided to check it out. From the trailer, it looked stupid and it was stupid but in a very smart way. I think 2017 The Babysitter was inspired by this movie. The movie is about a babysitter named Ashley who is moving away in a couple of days to start life anew somewhere else. She decided to babysit Luke, a smart twelve year old she has been babysitting for since he was eight years old, one last time. She is very aware he has a crush on her and she has a cute boyfriend named Ricky who is blowing her phone up throughout the night to since alone time with her before she leaves town. Things go array when weird events begin to happen and Ashley goes into protective mode to protect Luke and herself from potential home intruders. This movie was an unexpected twist, had so much black humor and was hilarious. I was expecting a movie plot similar to 2017 The Babysitter, which I also liked, and I was thoroughly surprised. In the final act, the movie was starting to get a little steam but that ending was awesome. Great movie, great cast, great cinematography, great script, a perfect example how to write a twist to elevate a movie, awesome originality with the storyline, great pacing, and overall a great movie. Definitely adding this movie to my Christmas horror movie collection.",Better Watch Out

133,AGood,First 30mins Brilliant. Last Hour Dreadful.,4,21 July 2018,"I found out about this film simply because I had seen The Visit and thought Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould were fantastic in this as brother and sister. And then I seen on IMDB a film called ""Better Watch Out"" with them both in as stars and figured it may be an unnoficial sequal or something along those lines. Its not. Firstly I strongly recommned people watch the Visit as it is a brilliant horror movie. But this movie. I will be honest the first 30 mins were brilliant and were setting a fantastic home invasion / coming of age / teen romance movie and the tension building up was brilliant and you could relate to each of the three characters and it felt like this was going to be right up there with 'Halloween' and 'You're Next' in terms of fantastic home invastion movies.Then 30mins in it suddenly goes in a totally different direction. And the direction it goes in completely bastardizes the setup of the first 30mins. It feels like the director and screenwriters suddenly started hating their life, or started smoking something that really caused them to lose touch on reality as none of is any good and none of it makes any sense and it was one of the worst hours in film history. The film over all is not worth a watch, at all. If a better director could remake this movie again continuing on the plot from the first 30mins onwards this would potentially be one of the best horror movies of the year. Overall avoid this movie like the plague. See The Visit twice in a row instead.",Better Watch Out

It's one of the most unique movies, much less slashers, that I've ever seen. And one of the absolute best as far as unapologetic psychotic behavior goes I've ever seen.

140,getconedproductions09,Its Okay,5,20 December 2018,"Better Watch Out:
Directed by Chris Peckover and written by Zack Hahn and Chris PeckoverBetter Watch Out starts out as a Christmas themed home invasion movie. It hits those beats fairly effectively I suppose. But then again as I was lulled to sleep with this same old same old, the movie switches gears. It was enough to get me to wake up and take notice. Most of this movie hinges on this twist. It's a twist that is not revealed in any advertising material and the entire movie is sold on a slightly different home invasion movie.I want to talk about it because it becomes a more interesting movie when this happens. I can throw hints out there. It's like Home Alone but evil. No, no. That's not it. More Bad Seed and The Good Son mixed with some Kevin McCallister/ Jigsaw ingenuity. It was unexpected and I liked where it was going. The bad thing is it's not very scary. Unlike All The Creatures Were Stirring, I'm not sure this is supposed to be straight comedy. It has some elements of levity to break the mood if we need.It does get a little icky for some moments. The person terrorizing the house wants to get with the babysitter really badly. This person does some disgusting things to her and gets her boyfriends involved in the chaos. I know I'm beating around the bush on the movie here. It's very difficult talking about this film without the twist. It happens fairly early in the proceedings and it colors things in a darker light.One of the main things I took away from this is how it cut away from a lot of the gruesome stuff. It gave it a tame feeling. I mean if we're going to get creepy sexual stuff and bits and pieces of the aftermath albeit obscured in very Austin Powers fashion, why not go for the full deal? Why hold back at all? It's not like this movie is trying to go for a PG-13. Thank God for that. Yuck PG-13 horror movies usually leave a bad taste in my mouth. They are persona non grata damn it. This movie was riding that line, tipping over every now and again.This isn't a boring movie. It has some fascinating ideas and most of the time everything is executed well. This movie didn't scare me or make me laugh. I was a bit bored and cold to it at times. It was middle of the road for me. I give this movie a C.",Better Watch Out

I know this mean shes alive and she would have told the cops but I was so tired of that boy that I wanted to see him suffer. One big mistake is when he check his phone I swore it says 12 minutes before his parents got home. There was no possible way he could have killed all those people stage everything and finish in time.

162,LiveYoLifeLikeYouMeanIt,Better not seen,4,19 October 2017,"This is what happens when the entirety of your movie is based off of a gimmick; it's one thing to give an engaging new spin to a genre concept and quite another to play your forced contrivances for supposed shock value. There are fine home invasion thrillers like Don't Breathe(2016) that while engaging in a different take on the genre trope, still manage to stay true to the spirit of the genre, delivering the much needed thrills in good measure. This misfire of a movie, Better Watch Out however, is one that is so pleased with it's little twist that it forgets to invest in anything that is remotely honest or earnest to make it a worthwhile viewing experience. The lacklustre start does not do the movie any favours but just as things seem to be settling in, it's all thrown out for a plot twist that from the very moment of inception robs the story of any suspense or thrill whatsoever. From this great twist onwards, the movie becomes an exercise in stringing together one implausible scenario to another, each one trying vying for that highly sought after shock value. When movies of this genre work, they work because they successfully manage to place the viewer in the protagonist's shoes, and in doing so generate the dread and suspense that drew audiences to it in the first place. Better Watch Out throws that all out the window, failing to invest in atmosphere, juxtaposing jarring scenes with cheery, melodious Christmas carols that much like the film itself, elicits a chuckle at first but soon runs out of steam. In the handful of scenes that the movie tries to humanize any of it's characters, it only feigns poignancy. The acting by everyone involved is commendable and the pacing is fine as well. At the end however, not only does the story resort to a plethora of plot conveniences, in all it's showyness it forgets to let the viewer in on the fun. Having your maniacal lead jive to jovial music, is no fun; it just propagates the tonal mishmash of genres and tricks.

I've come to realize how much I can predict and intuit just by employing some imagination. With this movie I hit the bull's eye. All I had to do was look at the inappropriate behavior of the actors to know what was coming. This was partly due to the reviews I'd read prior to seeing this movie, which pointed out the 'original' plot twist involved. So I said to myself, 'What do you think the creators would have thought of in this case, that would seem like an original thing?' And there you go, you end up with something not only banal but downright embarrassing. I don't know what to make of this movie as a whole, for I found it uninteresting and unfocused. Without revealing any key points in the plot I can only say that it might have worked half better if it concerned a bit older characters. It's not that the film itself it a complete waste, no. It has its value of entertainment, whatever that means, and sue it's going to be appreciated by a lot of people, especially the millennial generation. We've already seen such nihilistic approach with intention of evoking horror in the viewer, because, after all, what's more disturbing that the complete disregard for life and morals? Why does seem so utterly appalling when someone just commits murder and all they do is act like 'Oops! Well that's interesting,' and then shrug it off forget about it as if nothing happened?

Don't waste your time unless you're scared of prepubescent kids with squeaky voices trying to threaten people with guns they wouldn't know how to use.

Ending is quite frustrating and I guess the writer thought it be unique to have the kid cover everything up. But eh.Also I can't stand horror movies that cut away from the gore. What is the point in having a cool death by paint can, if the head isn't shown and we don't get to see the can hitting said head? Jealous little brat turned psycho. No back story, nothing on him.

173,kathrinmaass,"Christmas + Horror....well, that´s a story of its own",6,22 December 2018,"From years of reading reviews at the IMDb, checking ratings and rating myself I learned some things: While I stay way off from ""normal"" movies rated lower than 6 most of the time, I find Horror movie rated around 5 still OK. I guess the level for horror movies is just lower...compared to non-horror they might loose on an objective scale taking direction, cinematography, writing, editing and acting into account. But they might still be great horror movie. The same accounts for Christmas movies....Let´s be honest: Santa Claus (with tim Allen) objectively comes close to sharknado, but it is still a good Christmas movie. So I basically did not expect much from a Horror + Chritmas movie....But I found this movie actually not too bad at all....first of all I assume that some of the reviewers did not watch the movie to the end, because there is actually a second twist and even thrid one in the final credits. So stay tuned to that.What we have is a typical home invasion genre movie..-. NOT! This is not home invasion movie, actually it is quite the opposite.I must say that I found the movie deeply disturbing....there was just a little bit missing to have me really freak out about this psychopath kid. The contrast between this screwed up brat and the sweet chistmas atmosphere made me feel really uncomfortable....this movie actually does not give you much suspense nor does it shock. But it gets into you head and scrwes around with your mind. I have no idea how some of the reviewers can write somthing like ""Oh, it´s just the rape phantasies of a boy in puberty"". What is wrong with you people??? I am from Germany, so I do not (maybe luckily) have a clue how screwed up the average rape phantasies of a US-child are, but I can say for sure: I would not consider this the normal rape phantasies of anybody!And when Luke at the end is just about to get away with all of this, I just wanted to throw something hard and heavy into my TV set....but them came the twist....and than came the second twist and I was just about to crap my toaster oven and throw it into the TV again...So watch this pleasantly unpleasant movie....and stay tuned till the final credits!",Better Watch Out

This one, thank goodness, still had its rating intact at 6.5 - amazing given the pearl-clutchers at work in this very section: ""Oooh! I thought it would be a nice film!!""
""How dare they advertise falsely, it looked like the type of bland teen flick I like!""
I'm incredulous. The genius of this film is precisely what these people are complaining about. It is LABELED clearly as HORROR. I think what's led to people being thrown off balance is the fact that the term ""Horror"" has been diluted. This film IS truly horrifying, a breath of fresh air if you ask me.
Yes it is deceptive, yes it goes very far, yes it should! This does not make it a bad film, it makes it great entertainment.
To make a review that ""answers"" other reviews is a little vulgar, I know, but this is a worldwide gauge of merit, that anyone worth their salt checks before watching a film.

The writers and the director of this dung-heap should respectively give up writing and directing and go clean toilets instead, maybe then they would begin to learn something.
Don't misunderstand me, the concept of a psychotic 12/13 year old is very interesting and should have been handled differently from just simply taking pot-shots at other movies such as Home Alone, Joker (weird celebratory dancing), The Strangers; etc; etc; YAWN.
The attempted portrayal of psychotic behaviour in this soon to be forgotten forever (especially by the excellent young actors as just another payday!) waste of film-making equipment was NOT convincing.

The trailer gives you a hint but not enough to be certain of the ""twist"" to come. And even then, you still don't believe that things are going to get as out of hand as they do.There's a lot packed into this almost 90-minute film and while it's definitely firmly set in the ""silly-horror"" genre, and isn't particularly graphic, it delivers enough in the horror aspect to make you anxious and, at times, appalled. The acting is excellent, especially by the two leads. Levi Miller(Luke) has a long and bright future ahead of him if he keeps this level of delivery up. I'm not even surprised to find out that he's Australian. In fact, all three main characters are.

It soon turns in to a slick home-invasion thriller that flips at the 35-minute mark into something totally surprising. In its long disgusting history of the ""Christmas horror"" sub-genre, there's never been a movie quite like ""Better Watch Out,"" an unusually well-acted thriller, which plays with relevant things about suburbia, holiday entertainment and toxic masculinity. A cast of expert Australian child actors convincingly evoke upper- middle-class Americana, with Olivia DeJonge playing Ashley, a teenage babysitter who takes a last-minute gig to look after 12- year-old Luke (Levi Miller). What Ashley doesn't anticipate is that Luke who's long had a crush on her has enlisted his nerdy friend Garrett (Ed Oxenbould) to help him win her over. The plan almost immediately takes some unexpected turns, as other guests drop by. Gradually, Ashley figures out what's going on, and has to protect herself and the household she's been hired to safeguard.""Better Watch Out"" will likely become an enduring cult favorite with how attuned Chris Peckover in his 1st directorial movie and his co-writer, Zack Kahn, are to the nonsense of Christmas movies and the perverse fantasies of adolescent boys.

193,miraclejoy524,What is up the arses of all these reviewers!?,8,22 March 2018,"While this movie has its flaws like any other in its genre... for one to say that it isn't exceptional is just ridiculous. 
Filmmakers drop hints in the beginning leading to the dreaded conclusion that we're dealing with a modern day Norman Bates. 
The beautiful, yet cold and just overbearing enough mother...the way she emasculates her husband at Christmastime lets us know we're to draw our own conclusions about what she's like the rest of the year. The womb machine... Yikes.. It's actually very sad when you think about it: having a mother like that, throw in some serious mental instability with a dash of spoiled privilege and you get our antagonist-a young boy driven to madness at the idea of losing the only person who shows him any affection. ""You were never gonna let me go, were you..?"" That poor girl's fate was sealed the moment she told that family she planned to move away...
The acting is also very impressive...
This movie is heartbreaking and terrifying on so many levels. 
For those saying ""...it's not funny""... well no duh. There's nothing funny about people being lured to their deaths, their only crime being, they had the audacity to touch a psychopath's obsession (as Garrett learned).
However, seeing said psychopath greeting carolers with hot chocolate all while horror lies on the other side of the door is kind of funny..
Seeing his petite frame dance around in a Christmas sweater...is kind of funny..
Being reminded that this monster is a baby every time his voice cracks...is also kind of funny.
I'm impressed with the fact that I was still shaken a full 24 hours after watching this... It does its job, getting into one's head, making me second guess so many seemingly open and shut murder cases...wondering if we'd been duped by a Harry Houdini of getting out of things...
And sure, Luke was infuriating, making the movie so difficult to watch at times.. but isn't that what we want in our horror villains..?
Very rarely does a movie end leaving me staring at the screen wishing for more... I wanted to see some justice man!! However, I love and respect it for leaving us hanging.

197,Dmagic5000,Scary Christmas Fun,9,24 December 2017,"When you think of Christmas movies you think of cheesy, festive and joy filled movies. What you don't think of is terror, sinister and slightly disturbing. However, Better Watch Out is the newest Christmas themed horror movie and while there are a few issues the movie has, I found myself thoroughly entertained by the end.Olivia DeJonge (The Visit) stars as Ashley, a 17-year old girl on a babysitting gig she's done for years. The night takes a turn however, when dangerous intruders break in and terrorize her and 12-year-old Luke (Levi Miller, Pan). Now she must take charge to protect herself and Luke from the intruders, but soon she discovers this isn't a normal home invasion, and there may be something else going on.I went into this movie completely blind. I had never heard of it, I never saw the trailer, all I had was the description on the back of the box, and the imdb rating. I was intrigued and decided to give it a shot. This is how I would recommend seeing it as well. I watched the trailer afterwards and it sells a slightly different movie and could give away some major plot points if you're paying close enough attention. Just go in blind and I think you'll have a better time.The first 20 or 30 minutes of the movie, I didn't really know what to think. It has the horror cliched teenage girl who just broke up with her boyfriend and is avoiding his calls, it has a couple of jump scare fake outs, and there is some weird, sexual tension between the babysitter and 12-year-old Luke. Luke tells his best friend in the beginning how he has a crush on the babysitter, so his behaviour is understandable, but she kind of leads him on at times. She lets him put his head on her shoulder as they watch a scary movie, she grabs his hand when she's scared, but then she removes his hand when he rests it on her thigh. It's just a very weird dynamic.However, around the 20-30 minute mark, the movie takes a turn and it made the movie more interesting kept me engaged. It becomes a darker movie than expected with a great villain you really come to loathe and with motivations you understand.The acting in the movie by the three main leads is all very good. DeJonge is fantastic as Ashley. For most of the movie her mouth is duct taped and so most of her acting is done through the higher half of her face and you can see every emotion she is going through. Levi Miller is also very good in his role and the movie requires a lot from his character and he does a great job. Ed Oxenbould plays Luke's best friend and he is also great. He adds some good comic relief at times and he's also that audience character you see a lot in movies. He says things the audience is often thinking and he's a character the audience can really get behind.There are some issues the movie does have. First off, I don't really see the need for the movie to take place at Christmas. Besides the decorations, and one Home Alone joke, there really is no holiday connection. You could have taken Christmas out of the movie and it would have been the same movie. The pacing is also off at times. The movie is only 89 minutes long, but it feels longer. I also don't see why a 12-year-old kid, almost 13, needs a babysitter, not to mention an attractive one. 12 is the age when you yourself are old enough to babysit, so why he needs one is kind of odd to me.Overall this movie was a pretty good time. It tells an interesting story with interesting characters and everything leads to a very satisfying ending. If you want to watch a fun horror movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, and has a somewhat of a festive feel, take chance and check the movie. It does have it's problems, but it's a fun time.",Better Watch Out
198,jetmoviereviews,Better Watch This Movie,8,7 January 2019,"This is a very fun spin on a classic tale. There was a lot to love with this film. The acting was pretty good. The twist was something I did not see coming; I actually expected this to be just another home invasion movie. I'm glad I was wrong. The movie is very smart, and I really appreciated it.
There are flaws, however. The characters are stupid. The older characters should be able to easily overpower the boy. There was some ideas that I feel could have been executed better. For being rated R, they really avoided showing a lot of the gore, sadly. Maybe this is because they were dealing with young actors. Still, I was a little disappointed with that. Lucas (the boy) was really annoying, and I really wanted him to get caught, so I'm a little disappointed about that, too.

But what starts out as a typical (and bland) home invasion film, turns upside down after the first 30 minutes.As we were introduced to the characters in the first act, I found there to be something very off about Luke. But I brushed it off as a bad writing/acting, so the twist really came as a surprise.'Better Watch Out' is twisted and interesting take on home invasion genre, but not that entertaining of a film. The first act is really just a boring rehash of everything we've seen already. The twist and the next 10-15 minutes are quite intense, but ultimately it's just a gimmick without substance.

That's just the tip of the iceberg.Every single character in this movie is stupid and makes the dumbest decisions, except for the 12 year old villain of course, because why not. The acting is alright, but the jokes are incredibly immature and unfunny. The deaths in this movie come from characters throwing away their logic and common sense and basically asking to get killed.And my biggest pet peeve in any horror movie happens here: The villain wins in the end.

There was no trailer for this for quite a long time, so naturally my anticipation built up over time which is probably partly to blame...The idea was clever but the execution of the film was awful. I enjoyed Olivia DeJonge and Ed Oxenbould in The Visit so I thought this movie might be similarly entertaining but I was sadly mistaken. The acting is BAD by several characters but especially the lead boy, you know, the sociopath. However, I'm not sure if it's really the acting that is so bad or if it's simply down to terrible writing and poor character development...All of the characters were incredibly unlikeable, the worst of the bunch of course being the lead sociopathic teen (Luke) played by Levi Miller. I haven't seen him in anything else so maybe it was just down to the awful script/poor character development? I just HATED watching this movie but kept soldering on and watched it in it's entirety in hope of it getting better and at least having a satisfying ending. However, it failed there too, by the end I was just hoping to see an amazing final scene of Olivia DeJong's character destroying Levi Miller's character - now THAT would have been a satisfying ending and could warrant possibly an increased score of 2/10 from me.",Better Watch Out

247,MarkW-CCP,"Great trailer, alright film, wanted more out of it.",6,9 October 2017,"When i first saw the trailer for this film I wasn't really sure what to expect. The trailer is all over the map, but in a good way. I was enticed. I was interested. The idea of a twisted horror-comedy version of Home Alone seemed so awesome and obvious that I couldn't believe it had taken this long to happen. After seeing the finished film - rented on VOD - I feel a little let down, slightly confused (not in the best way), and a little misled.Without giving too much away, Better Watch Out is a story of a young boy and his babysitter and a hellish night sometime over the Christmas holidays. Our main heroes are accosted in a variety of different ways and, as seen in the trailer, get to exercise some heavy emotions in some comically brutal and nostalgic ways. For the purposes of this review I will assume you've seen the trailer, but I will do my best to avoid giving anything else away.Two of the stars of this film, Ashley, the babysitter, played by Olivia DeJonge and Garret, the best friend played by Ed Oxenbould also appeared together, albeit as brother and sister, in a film I really liked, differing opinions abound, M. Knight Shyamalan's ""The Visit.: Both were solid in that film, and that holds true in Better Watch Out. Also, babysittee, Luke, played by Levi Miller, who I knew obliquely from the trailers for ""Pan"" in which he plays the title role, is fantastic in this film. All the talent in the film is pretty great: all the young stars carrying themselves well, and with wonderful, smaller roles for the first billed Virginian Madsen and Patrick Warburton. The Direction by Chris Peckover, another name I'm new to, was mostly well paced and competent, no complaints from me here, a little draggy at times, but nothing to harp on.The violence and gore in this movie is also pretty good, and we had a delightful amount of F- bombs and other curse words to earn this movie it's R Rating, but since they already had the R, I figured they would go a little harder. The trailer gives of us a taste of a fantastic scene: ""You're Home Alone-ing him?"" I really liked this scene, through and through I does everything right - and I honestly believe this idea might be the inception for the whole movie, that this one idea led to this whole film. Other than that though, I felt a lot of the violent moments were a little tame. Not necessarily a bad thing, again, it all worked pretty well, I just kinda wanted more, but maybe I'm the sick one.I think my main problem with this film is that it didn't really need to be a Christmas movie. Don't get me wrong, I love me a good Holiday Horror movie and I figure serial killer-psychos can like Christmas too, so bring on the Yuletide terror, but other than wanting to reference Home Alone that one time, nothing really screamed Christmas in this movie, again, I fall back on the idea that the paint can gag was the catalyst for the whole thing.In the end, I felt a little let down because I really wanted more out of the Home Alone references, that's the way it was sold to me. I liked the twists, I liked the turns, I loved the actors and I'm fine, I guess, with the Christmas setting, but it just didn't live up to what I had hoped for. I paid $6 CAD for my girlfriend and I to watch it and I feel like I got my money's worth, that's enough right. If you're a fan of Christmas-themed horror movies and dig the horror-comedy genre, I think it's worth a look, but if you wanna wait till it's on Netflix, the VOD prince drops, or something like that, feel free, especially since Christmas is still 77 Days away.",Better Watch Out

249,conanyouredevilish,"Disgusting, horrible and gets more ridiculous the longer this movie goes",1,23 June 2018,"I normally don't write reviews, but whenever something really gets a bad reaction from me, I'm going to break my trend.Anyways I checked out this movie after seeing it on the shelf of my library, and the images and summary on the DVD advertises this movie like some sort of horror comedy version of Home Alone, and well I was up for a story like that. I ended up getting something completely different. By the 20 minute mark, the movie pulls off their big twist and guess what? There is no home invasion as advertise. It was the kid's (Luke) best friend (Garrett) pretending to be a home invader because he wanted to win over the heart of his babysitter (Ashley) by saving her from a fake home invasion he planned. Ashley figured out it was fake because Garrett stupidly wore a mask Luke owned. Anyway she rightfully decides to leave the house angry and not liking to be rejected, Luke slaps and knocks Ashley down a flight of stairs, knocking her out. You know those young kids, specifically boys, who has a secret crush on a older girl but resents that she has a boy friend? Yeah that kid wrote a script and it became this movie. However this isn't the fantasy of a boy winning over his crushes heart against her boyfriends, this is a boy's warped, twisted, misogynist, perverse rape/murder fantasy. Ashley wakes up taped and gag to a chair and she's like this throughout the bulk of the movie, so if you're a fan of the actress, this is the state she's going to be in for the rest of the movie. I would recommend you stop watching the movie after this point. I continue because I was sort of curious where this was going and thought maybe the film would take a more comedic turn. It didn't, there was no jokes and if anything it's actually more serious than the first 20 minutes. Luke is not a scary or interesting villain. He's just a annoying little shit who needs a good punch to the face before being thrown into a psyche ward. The film wants you to think Luke is this clever mastermind as he mentions how he and Garrett has gotten into lighter trouble at school, but he always figure out a way out of it. No no, he's not a brilliant mastermind as he and Garrett constantly make mistakes that allowed the other characters to nearly stop them as you would expect from 12/13 yr old annoying villains. You remember those silly slasher films of the 80s and 90s that requires for the entire world to be full of stupid people and for the universe to align itself perfectly in order for no one to know there's a killer on the loose? This film takes that style of writing. Luke's next step in his great plan is to text Ashley's boyfriend (Jeremy) to come over. Yes nothing dumb with this idea to invite someone who's bigger and stronger than you to come over, and could easily spot Ashley tied to a chair in the kitchen and quickly dial 911 on that phone he'll obviously have on him since you're sending him text messages through it. However since we're dealing with 80s style slasher writing, Jeremy looks in every room in Luke's house except the kitchen where Ashley is. There's not even anything to obstruct the view of the kitchen, they're just completely relying on Jeremy never looking in that direction. They blunder some more and Luke nearly gets taken out by Jeremy after failing to knock him out the first time. However they do eventually manage to tie him up too. We then get our Home Alone reference when they bring Jeremy under the second floor balcony and Luke wants to test out what will happen when a full paint can is actually swung over a balcony into a person's head. The character of Garrett is possibly one of the biggest raging idiots I've ever seen. The film portrays him like he's suppose to be the Milhouse to Luke's Bart. Now kids with low confidence are known to be easily manipulated by peers to do things like steal or vandalize, but this film takes this idea to the extreme. He also has Milhouse's wussiness as throughout the entire film, whenever Luke takes things to his next step, Garrett has that ""this is a bad idea, we should stop this"" reaction. He was already freaking out when Ashley found out the home invasion was fake, and again was freaking out when Luke knocked Ashley down a flight of stairs. When kids were pressured to do things they don't want to like vandalize and steal, only to get caught then other kids manage to knock out the person who caught them, they're reaction would be to normally run the hell away. Or in the case you actually know the person very well, try to help them and apologize. Yes it's established Ashley knows both Luke and Garrett very well as she has babysat them in the past. Not Garrett though. Even when Garrett finds out Luke lied about losing Garrett's pet hamster that he loved, that Luke actually killed the hamster and did it intentionally, even when Ashley in one of the times she can actually talk is telling Garrett Luke is no friend and is manipulating him, even when Luke fails his first attempt killing Jeremy with his Home Alone stunt (yes he fails to hit Jeremy's head the first time, so tries it again), even when Luke invites yet another one of Ashley's ex boyfriends after killing Jeremy, even when Luke is showing zero remorse or sympathy for his actions and is actually laughing and acting like he's having the greatest night of his life kidnapping Ashley and killing off her boyfriends, Garrett still continues to help this psychotic little shit carry on his plans. It's not until Luke kills the 2nd ex that Garrett begins to develop something resembling a brain and decides to try and help Ashley. However about halfway cutting her free, Luke blows away Garrett and his head with a shotgun. BTW no one hears multiple loud shotgun rounds going off in the middle of the night. Keep in mind, this isn't a secluded area or anything, it's suppose to be a typical populated neighbourhood. There's also two other big scenes of stupidity I need to point out. Ashley manages to free herself after Luke fails his first Home Alone attempt, and gets a hold of their handgun that they left on the counter. We get the typical scene where the protagonist is telling the villain to stop or they'll shoot them. Scenes like this always make roll my eyes because I'm always screaming to shoot them in the leg if you don't want to be a killer, and the actual killers are no longer a threat, problem solved. Eventually it turns out the gun was unloaded and Ashley tosses it away instead of keeping it so they can't get it back then reload it. Eventually there's a small chase between Ashley and Garrett and somehow Luke manages to catch up to Ashley and knock her out with a brick. Let me emphasize how ridiculous this is. Luke's home only has two entry ways as far as we know: the front door and the back door. The front door has carolers there, so Luke obviously couldn't have used the front door otherwise the carolers would've seen him. The backyard where the back door is has a tall fence between 5 to 6 ft high that Garrett is too wimpy to even climb over while attempting to chase Ashley. Luke is about the same height and frame as Garrett, so he would've had just as much trouble getting over it on top of both having a massive head start over him. Yet Luke apparently manages to offscreen teleport (another silly 80s slasher trope) on the other side of the fence and knock Ashley out before she reached the carolers.The final big scene of stupidity is Luke's great master plan to get away with it all. What does he do? He cleans up the house like nothing happened while leaving Garrett, Ashley, Jeremy, and Ricky (the other ex boyfriend) dead bodies exactly where they. He put some of the yellow paint from the can that killed Jeremy onto Ricky's hand, then shotgun in his hand and seems to be trying to frame Ricky for the murders. Many problems here. Ricky came into the back yard, and never even stepped foot into the home. Not exactly hard to figure out he was never inside seeing as there's snow on the floor, so his boot prints should visibly stopped where he died. None of his wet boot prints inside the house since it was all cleaned. No yellow paint hand prints anywhere in the home since Luke put yellow paint on his hand. Oh and Ricky is dead with I'm sure a rope mark around his neck since Luke killed him via hanging. Luke also cuts him down and leaves his body on the ground so it doesn't even look like a murder suicide ordeal. I'm willing to bet Luke locked the backdoor too going off his cleanup montage, also adding no signs of forced entry on top of the laundry list to prove Ricky wasn't even inside the house let alone the killer. Then Luke's great master plan ends by literally putting on his pajamas, go to his bedroom and act like he slept through the whole ordeal and this moronic plan actually works! Are you fucking kidding me? There are four dead bodies, one alive who also happens to live in the house the killings took place, directly knows two of the victims, the place is mysteriously clean and he's acting like he slept through the whole thing and knows nothing? Apparently no one even has half a functioning braincell to be suspecting this person? Actually there's one more stupid big scene that's suppose to act like dual surprise endings here. We find out Ashley is still alive and we see her giving Luke the middle finger as he's watching her being wheeled into the ambulance from the his bedroom window. After the first set of end credits, we cut back to Luke telling his mom they should visit Ashley in the hospital implying he's either going to successful kill her or more stupidity is going to continue on in the hospital as Ashley tries to get away from Luke. I just felt sick and very dirty after finishing this movie. The two guys who wrote and directed this movie (the director is also credit as a writer too) must be two misogynist guys who had one too many women dump them for better people, and this film is their revenge fantasy come to life.",Better Watch Out

A half hour into the movie it takes the worst possible turn, and you know where the rest of it is headed. At that point it becomes neither horrifying nor thrilling, but just plain nauseating. It's not fun and violent the way the similarly- themed and much more engaging The Babysitter is (a film which is properly labeled a horror/comedy, unlike this film). It's not gross out gross like the comparatively soulless torture porn Saw/Hostel movies. It's not even fascinating as an exploration of sociopathology as was American Psycho or Twisted Nerve (which is the film it most closely resembles). It's jaw-dropping only because I find it hard to believe that those involved thought it would be entertaining as is. The trailer hides the twist and sells it as a fun exercise in the little brat left home alone turning the tables on some home invaders, only with blood and carnage as a result rather than Three Stooges sound effects. That is not what this movie is. Not even close. But that's what The Babysitter is, so watch that instead.",Better Watch Out
271,gamester80,As unsure of itself as a 12 year old hitting on his babysitter...,6,30 November 2017,"So often a film achieves the dreaded ""middle of the road"" by being well made, but uninventive, unsurprising but consistent, forgettable yet enjoyable. BWO instead finds itself ending up dead center by wildly vacillating between moments of truly fascinating tension and intrigue and stretches of unfathomable incongruency, dull, self-congratulatory exposition, and outright stupidity.The ""twist"" in this Xmas-themed home invasion, is that the ""invasion"" is fake, an attempt by a lovesick 12 year old to gain the affections of his 17 year old babysitter. It takes a while to get to that point, though, and along the way we are treated to not ineffective tension building moments (that will, of course, fall flat on repeat viewings) intercut with his painfully useless bids for affection. Once his sinister nature is revealed, one keeps expecting him to throw off his veil of immaturity, and he does, only to repeatedly and randomly re-don it with the kind of irregular emotional instability one expects of a hormonal youth. Is he a cold- blooded sociopath or gleefully violent obsessive? The script never decides, instead choosing to focus on congratulating itself on how smart it thinks it is. Too bad it isn't.

This movie actually explains what happens when a psychopath is left home alone. Not alone in the movie though but levi miller pulled a beauty in this role. Movie keeps you guessing what next is going to happen and often times pulls off the impossible. Levi miller and Olivia dejonge perfectly portray there roles. Especially after watching the movie one would remember the strong headed girl in Olivia dejonge. Movie is filled with clever twists and humour when needed. 
The best twist would be the post credit scene that burries the whole satisfaction experience delivered in the climax of the film and keeps you guessing only for a sequel to be made. It better be left to one's imagination though. The movie's premise and trailers would definitely misguide you of it being a home alone kind of a movie. But it completely ruins the innocence of the home alone series and brings in the creepiness that is quite depressing and unbelievable after some time. Performances from every actor is flawless and they will go long. Direction is pretty good for the scenes and story development is keenly done. I couldn't point out any flaw in the storyline but in the end they kimd of stressed it way too far to be believable. Watch it you must if you are looking for a cringe horror.

Then, after watching it, I saw that it did, generally, get good reviews. And I was baffled. Here's why.The premise of the movie is absurd. Now, I know that a lot of you will say ""yeah, duh."" But it's absurd in a way that only flies if we're all kind of in on the joke, and like the joke, from the get go. And honestly, the only way you could be in on this joke, or appreciate it after the fact, is if you're a sexless creep that's planning on shooting up a girls' dorm and thought ""hey, Hollywood finally gets me."" This movie plays like a less plausible Silence of the Lambs, if Hannibal Lecter were a snarky, post-woke adolescent that nobody but an actual sociopath -- one that doesn't know how physics or human bodies work -- could be rooting for.Now I know that movies sometimes make the protagonist(s) a villain. I know that. But this protagonist/villain is so specifically about girl/chad hate that you'd need to have lived under a rock for the past few years to miss the connection. The disturbing elements of the plot seem less edgy, in the context of current events, and more slimy, creepy, and disappointing.And beyond the edge factor, there is absolutely nothing good about it.

299,joshjames669,Think: Depravity in the spirit of Home Alone,6,26 December 2019,"I watched this film when it first came to DVD, but I've added to my annual Christmas watchlist, so I thought it was time to give it a review. It's a really fun, devious home invasion film, purposefully reminiscent of Chris Columbus's and John Hugh's Christmas classic, Home Alone - a really twisted Home Alone.Chris Peckover delivers a viciously fun Christmas horror black comedy. Twelve-year-old Luke's (Levi Miller) parents leave him at home on Christmas Eve with his regular babysitter, the witty, the beautiful, the older, the object of Luke's affection, Ashley. What was supposed to be an easy babysitting job for Ashley spirals out of control when a masked intruder interrupts the evening.The premise is fun if twisted. The laughs and groans come from a plot that is by turns slapstick comedy and old school gore. Miller delivers a delightfully duplicitous performance, which is complemented by Ed Oxenbould's portrayal of Luke's BFF, Garrett. They're a good pair of embarrassingly adolescent boys trying to impress the out-of-their-league babysitter.The best part, though, is Olivia Dejonge, who I think is far too underrated. She reunites with her The Visit co-star (Oxenbould) and, while Ashley (Better Watch Out) and Becca (The Visit) are similar, she nails the portrayal. Dejonge is believable as the clever, strong, morally obliged female lead. She is not a ""damsel in distress"" in the conventional sense, though distressed she does become. While she finds herself in a victim's position, it is not the result of intellectual inferiority or weakness. Her tragic flaw, rather, is a moral obligation to protect her adolescent charges.We need more holiday horrors like this, more characters like Ashley, and filmmakers should do themselves the favor of casting Dejonge more. Her most recent credit is on Netflix's The Society, and even here her character is under-utilized. So, add Better Watch Out to your Christmas horror list and watch for Dejonge's career to take off.",Better Watch Out

I realized you don't have to wait long into the movie to realize that all your assumptions about this film are completely wrong. Although some of the acting could have been better, it wasn't a total let down. I was shocked at how the movie escalated and was totally taken a back at what occurred. In a good way of course. The main thing that concerned me over all with this film, is that it is Rated R. With that being said, If I purchase a movie rated R and it's a horror fan. I want to see gore or crazy killing situations. The camera never showed what happened and a few of the killing seasons weren't really believable.

316,meagan_victoria_speer,Low ratings don't get it,10,29 January 2020,"I avoided this movie for years because I thought they gave away everything in the movie... Years later. Beyond impressed I watch horror movies as my main drama this was beautiful. Well acted, well directed and very very well written. I never knew what was next.",Better Watch Out
317,iksmsmsjr,No.,1,23 December 2018,Just no. Played out like an incel's wet dream. I will never get this time back.,Better Watch Out
318,ordleoccupando,"Misleading, ludicrous and implausible script.",1,6 December 2020,"Creepy psycho twelve year hold murders his babysitter and others. Pacing is weak.
At no point is it scary. It just plods along in a in an implausible but still predictable way. You'll be looking at your watch while wondering which clueless agency is representing the protagonist, so they can be avoided.
The ""twist"" is revealed 25 minutes in. Hateful and strangely dull movie.",Better Watch Out
319,jamesanderer,Interesting Dynamic,9,16 August 2017,"I saw this film at 0 Cinema in Miami and my fiancé and I were so surprised how original and unpredictable it was. I watch a lot of films and not since Apocalypto was I so clueless as to what direction the story was going. There's a great dynamic with the main characters that makes you wonder what are they up to and what's going to happen next. The pace is a tad slow, but it helps build suspense and acting is top notch. I usually hate kid actors because they're stupid kids with their stupid kid faces but every actor in this is good.",Better Watch Out
320,dddgoad,This is my type of movie (in other words NOT BORING))!,9,26 August 2017,"from all the hype & was ready to be disappointed because I with movies like Don't Breathe and Green Room and The Witch and It Comes After Night, I liked em but didn't get just why so much of the buzz.Now, Better Watch Out it's a little like those others but not to much. The movie ain't perfect but its more fun I've had in a movie theater with this genre in years. It is a smart premise and good art designThere's something cool when you're in a theater and all experiencing it together if its one of those suspense ones. I might of not loved it as much if i was watching it at work like usual but that's just me.this movie will make you ticked off when characters do (or don't do) things and it will make you clap and jump and it will give you something to talk about for sure.it's a little like this movie called Hush or that Liev Tyler one The Strangers except with tons of surprises.I can see this becoming a sleepover movie hit forever. It would of been in my young days for sure and when my daughter is old enough, I'm sure she'll have fun with it.",Better Watch Out
321,nyang-52959,Meh. Next.,4,9 October 2017,"Perhaps you'll like this movie. Watch it for yourself. It is truly different. Haven't seen anything like it before I guess. My opinion? I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought. Seemed like a majority of people enjoyed it however. As for me, I was more annoyed but to each their own. I'm simply writing my experience. Do not read as there are spoilers ahead.I saw that this movie had pretty good ratings and I was interested in watching a horror movie right before sleeping. It all seemed like a normal home invasion where two kids and the babysitter fight against robbers. Nope. I also assumed that there would be an actual invasion after the prank by the boys on the babysitter. Nope. I just didn't want to believe that the kids were actually gonna go on a murderous spree. Luke's bratty attitude is really not like-able. I was so damn annoyed after the prank that I skimmed bit by bit and realized that he went craaazy. Depending on how you like your movies, either you'll want justice (like me) or not. The kid almost gets away. At least there was some sort of justice at the end.",Better Watch Out
322,spidermanfan-98201,"""Levi Miller is the Norman Bates of Holiday Cheer""",10,14 October 2017,"Just when you think Christmas Comedy Horror movies are going out of style. You get a new film like Better Watch Out is original, bloody, funny, and scary. Films like this don't happen every day its clever and I'm looking forward to watching it every year on Christmas. Better Watch Out is an Instant Christmas Classic!",Better Watch Out
323,fjames-22941,complete waste,1,2 December 2017,"Watched this at a boring party, and believe me had I had any other option I'd be so mad I wasted two hours of my life that I'll never get back. Now if I would've paid to see this in a theater I'd be livid. One of those movies u watch hoping it'll get better and never does. Slow paced with no payoff and how it's getting a 7.1 IMDb rating is completely beyond me. Awful awful movie. Moves at a snails pace and the characters you just don't care what happens to them. Hate is such a strong word but this movie is pretty close.",Better Watch Out
324,melissas-25888,This movie is fantastic.,9,26 December 2017,Agree with below-- AVOID SPOILERS. Did not see this plot twist coming. This movie far exceeded my expectations. Extremely creepy and excellent casting. WATCH THIS MOVIE.,Better Watch Out
325,komal_hunjan,All you'll experience is disappointment!,1,9 January 2018,"I don't get why on earth was any investment made in such a project. With a completely misleading trailer, the film is no where close to a 'comedy' as the trailer claims. The biggest question that arises is that what was the aim behind writing and filming such a story? A story of a 12-year old (psychopath) boy going about drinking alcohol, harassing a girl, assaulting and killing people and at the end (as can be easily perceived), getting away with all the sinister things he has done. I mean, what does the film teach by portraying kids talking crap, smoking weed and what not? 
An absolutely sickening film; I wouldn't recommend watching this one as I myself am regretting for wasting 1 hour and 29 minutes of my life.",Better Watch Out
326,escala-09664,The worse movie I've seen ever,1,1 November 2018,"It is a stupidy american movie. No sense. No story. Only the american obssesion by guns and kill people.
