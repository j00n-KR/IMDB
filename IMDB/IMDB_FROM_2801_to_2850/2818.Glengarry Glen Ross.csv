0,TheLittleSongbird,Brilliant performances and screenplay make this film so worth watching,10,13 February 2011,"Glengarry Glen Ross is a truly wonderful film, primarily for two things.One is the screenplay. This screenplay is brilliant, with many thought-provoking moments and also some emotionally resonant ones too.The other asset is the acting. In what is essentially an ensemble cast, the entire cast give superb performances particularly Al Pacino, Alec Baldwin and Ed Harris, and even Kevin Spacey makes a telling cameo.Cinematography and editing wise Glengarry Glen Ross cannot be faulted either. While most of the film takes place in one place, the cinematography and editing make this work.The story is always compelling and the film is further advantaged by strong direction, good pacing and well-written characters.In conclusion, a wonderful film helped by the script and performances especially. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Glengarry Glen Ross
1,bkoganbing,The Machine Runs Down,9,1 February 2007,"To answer everyone's question first upon seeing the title, no Glengarry Glen Ross does not have a Scottish setting. The title is an amalgam of of a series of property lots that this group of shark real estate salesman are trying to peddle. As sleazy a bunch as you will ever find are the staff of this real estate firm, located in Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn. David Mamet's play ran in the 1984-1985 season on Broadway for 378 performances and it's a property for a great ensemble cast which is what was assembled here. Al Pacino got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, yet it's unfair to single out his performance as better than the others. Any one of them could have been nominated, they all have their moments.By the time Glengarry Glen Ross came to the screen, the Reagan years were over. The Eighties were a decade driven by unbridled capitalism the likes we had not seen since the robber barons. But those people created industry, the wealth of the eighties was in get rich quick stock market speculation. The only real new industry was the computer driven ones as we moved from the age of industry to the age of information. These salesmen are the Reagan era personified. Make money at any cost even if you become an outright conman. They are in their thirties and forties, one however is reaching senior citizen status and ought to be retired, but has financial obligations.That of course is Jack Lemmon who is playing a very similar part to the one he won an Oscar for in Save the Tiger. That character too, faced middle age with pressing financial concerns and he makes a choice to have an arson fire at his factory with the insurance settlement getting him out of debt. Here Lemmon's Shelley 'the Machine' Levine, once a crack salesman has let the younger ones including his own protégé Pacino out do him in a highly competitive environment. He makes a wrong choice and it doesn't work out so good.Ed Harris as a loudmouth blowhard of a salesman and Kevin Spacey as the harried office manager make their characters real. Alec Baldwin has a small ten minute role at the beginning of the film as the motivational vice president of the firm who provides some real incentives for these guys to keep their jobs. Inadvertently he sets up all the events to follow. His performance is very similar to the one that Ben Affleck did in Boiler Room.Glengarry Glen Ross is a stunning commentary on the American get rich quick ethic and the Reagan years. It's great ensemble acting and should not be missed.",Glengarry Glen Ross
2,SnoopyStyle,Mamet script sings and Lemmon desperation,9,13 January 2016,"Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon) is a desperate salesman with a daughter in the hospital. Blake (Alec Baldwin) is brought in by Mitch and Murray to push the sales force. The highest sales number gets a Cadillac. The last one gets fired. Dave Moss (Ed Harris) is incensed and pushes George Aaronow (Alan Arkin). Manager John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) is given Glengarry leads to hold. Ricky Roma (Al Pacino) is the best closer in the office and selling James Lingk (Jonathan Pryce) in a bar.The Mamet script sings. This is like music. If it's written poorly, Baldwin's pitch would sound campy. The fact that it's so compelling proves that it is brilliant. As for the actors, one can almost smell the stink of Lemmon's desperation. Ed Harris is terrific in his bravado but also his cowering to Blake. The acting power is beyond questioning.",Glengarry Glen Ross
3,kosmasp,ABC,10,4 October 2020,"The ABCs of script writing? You would be excused to think and say so. Especially considering the movie is filmed as scripted. That in itself does not happen that often. But that happening and the movie being so good? Ok so the actors in this are phenomenal to say the least and it is based on a play. Still according to Lemmon there is no adlib in this. Which is incredible, when you think not just of the dialogue and ""ahms"", but the speed in which it is delivered! Really fascinating to say the least.And then the story! I mean how can anyone not be drawn in? Yes the characters shown here are different levels of despicable and still you root for them. Because you see their struggle! Because Alec Baldwin is the evil that gives them a deadline ... btw. that performance of his ... talking to Alda, Harris and Lemmon that way? Wow ... I mean just wow. And then you have Kevin Spacey who is quite contraint and still leaves as much dents as any other actor in this. Have I talked about Pacino yet? No? Again, just hearing and seeing those names ... masterclass in so many ways. And then the ending - I think you can draw things from this from multiple viewings. Which I'm very likely to do.Edit: at first I wasn't aware of the foul language/profanity used in this. Which says I reckon more about myself and my threshold than the movie itself. But also that it felt natural for the characters to curse. It just fit - which is why this was called (amongst the cast and crew) as ""Death of a f...ing Salesman"". Fitting indeed.",Glengarry Glen Ross
4,classicsoncall,"""Did the leads come in yet?""",8,24 December 2011,"If I had any kind of clue how many times the word 'leads' would be used in the picture I would have kept count. Obviously someone did because the trivia section here says it happened eighty three times. Considering the 'F' word was used almost twice as much, I don't know why 'leads' jarred me so much every time I heard it. Just goes to show that the other word is so much more common in movies today.You know, the title of this film has bothered me ever since it came out. Without knowing the story and the real estate deals involved, it never made any sense to me. Now that I've seen it I have the context so it's become a non-issue.I never worked in sales except for a brief stint in autos about a decade ago. It seemed like a rigged game in the office I worked for; fifty cars in four months and only made ten grand. You do the math. I chalk it up to a learning experience for the brief time involved at a time I didn't really need to make a lot. The cutthroat stuff never appealed to me and I'd rather make an honest living anyway. I know there are bullies like Blake out there, but they can't look in a mirror. Speaking of which, it's extraordinary to me that Alec Baldwin turned into this character for real over the past couple of years as evidenced by the cell phone rant to his daughter and the recent Airlines tirade fiasco. What a guy! This won't be everyone's cup of tea for sure, but if the chicanery involved in high stakes pressure selling appeals to you, this is one of the best. Any one of the principals - Pacino, Lemmon, Arkin, Spacey or Harris - is top drawer and worth the price of admission alone. The set-up with Moss (Harris) and George (Arkin) over robbing the office was a clever sleight of hand piece by the time The Machine (Lemmon) 'fessed up. Even with his hand in the cookie jar, the old veteran still looks to cut a deal with a guy he hates. Man, that's selling.",Glengarry Glen Ross
5,gavin6942,Real Estate... What a Racket,8,10 September 2012,"An examination of the machinations behind the scenes at a real estate office.Never have I seen so many talented actors in one picture. I suppose ""L.A. Confidential"" also comes to mind (and has the exceptional Kevin Spacey, too) but this really takes the cake. Alec Baldwin? Al Pacino? Spacey? Ed Harris? And Jack Lemmon? Holy smokes! Lemmon is an interesting character, definitely past his prime and determined not to be fired. Can his cold-calling work? It makes him a difficult character to love. We do not want him to be fired, as he seems to be the only one with a heart. But cold calling? Is there a more devious selling practice? Pacino is great, Spacey is superb... Baldwin has far too small a role.",Glengarry Glen Ross
6,lee_eisenberg,"learn your ABCs (that's ""always be closing"")",10,11 May 2006,"If you thought that ""Raging Bull"" and ""Mystic River"" hit you like a kick in the gut, then just wait until you see ""Glengarry Glen Ross"". This look at the nasty side of the real estate business knocks the wind out of you. For starters, there's Blake (Alec Baldwin), the very epitome of the cruel, hostile businessman ready to fire anyone who under-performs (""Do you understand me, you f---ing f---ots?!""). There's Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), the successful salesman without much care for his cohorts. There's John Williamson (Kevin Spacey), a jerk inheriting everything. There's Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon), Dave Moss (Ed Harris) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin), the aging, less successful members who are probably about to get fired. But overall, things don't look to great for anyone.In conclusion, this is really the type of movie that could easily freeze your blood. You'll never look at the real estate business the same way again. It haunts you like almost no other movie could, and goes to show how our society likes to spit out anyone who has moved ""past his/her prime"". Also starring Jonathan Pryce.",Glengarry Glen Ross
7,jboothmillard,Glengarry Glen Ross,10,25 April 2007,"I have hardly ever seen a film with big stars all creating memorable performances, and hardly leaving the one main location, but this is the quintessential film to do this. Basically one day at a Chicago real-estate office, big man Blake (Alec Baldwin) gives a strong (and arrogant) incentive, and pressures the salesmen of the company to sell more or lose their jobs. First prize of this contest is a Cadillac Eldorado, second prize is a set of steak knives, third prize is being fired. No-one can afford to lose for good sales leads. The four salesmen, including Ricky Roma (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Al Pacino), oldest member Shelley Levene (a superb Jack Lemmon), George Aaronow (Little Miss Sunshine's Alan Arkin) and Dave Moss (Ed Harris) are now doing everything they can to make the perfect sale and get top of the leader board. There is a robbery, and unforeseen consequences will come to the characters. John Williamson (then little known Kevin Spacey), as Blake's associate is the man who is responsible for the leader board, and he is also just as arrogant as his over-ruler. Also starring Jonathan Pryce as James Lingk, who helps Ricky with some of the sales information. For me, some of the highlights were not just the quality performances, but the use of bad language, in some moments I found myself laughing. Jack Lemmon was number 43, Kevin Spacey number 4, and Al Pacino number 1 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Pacino was also number 26 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Robert De Niro) on The World's Greatest Actor. Outstanding!",Glengarry Glen Ross
8,Woodyanders,Dog eat dog,9,31 May 2017,"Several struggling salesman are given a short amount of time to prove their worth as valuable and essential assets to the company they work for in the fiercely cut-throat world of real estate.Director James Foley and screenwriter David Mamet not only astutely capture the raw desperation and compromised integrity of a handful of down on their luck guys who are just barely hanging on by their fingernails, but also capture both the nerve-wracking pressure cooker nature of do or die white collar hustling and the savage competitive mindset of the predatory alpha dog male psyche with equally bracing acuity and potency. The outstanding acting by the bang-up cast keeps this film humming: Al Pacino growls curse words and radiates pure sleaze with incendiary brio as ruthless and aggressive hot shot Ricky Roma, Jack Lemmon contributes a gut-wrenching turn as sadsack washed-up has-been Shelley ""The Machine"" Levine, Ed Harris hits the right cynical note as the bitter and deceitful Dave Moss, Alan Arkin cuts a poignantly pathetic figure as the hopelessly meek George Aaronow, Kevin Spacey oozes smug superiority as flinty office manager John Williamson, Jonathan Pryce elicits sympathy as vulnerable mark James Lingk, and Alec Baldwin delivers a bravura cameo as vicious motivational speaker Blake. Both Juan Ruiz Anchia's crisp cinematography and James Newton Howard's spare jazzy score are up to speed. An absolute powerhouse.",Glengarry Glen Ross
9,ma-cortes,A terrific acted movie with all-star-cast based on a foul-mouthed play by David Mamet,7,15 June 2021,"A superbly acted film with the greatest players giving powerful portrayals of the real state sellers . But all of them are in danger of getting the ax from their hard-driving and venomous bosses , acting as head-hunters. As the life-soured , short-fused real state salesmen are threatened of being fired if they don't sell property .A dramatic movie with seven-character studio, shot in stage-style , in fact it was written by successful playwright David Mamet who is occassionally filmmaker too . As David Mamet scripted from his Tony-Award winning Broadway play. Chronicling 48 hours in the lives of some sleazy and unfortunate salesmen who will stop at nothing to get their purports . It shows the extreme competence among various clerks of a real state office and their strong fights to get the sales for obtaining advantages and prizes . Cast is frankly fabulous, outstanding Jack Lemmon as the hustler fallen on dim prospects, Al Pacino as the glad-handing sales leader , Ed Harris , Alan Arkin , Kevin Spacey as a stiff office box , brief performances from Bruce Altman , Jude Ciccolella , and Alec Balwin as the company hatchet-man.It contains an adequate and colourful cinematography by the Spanish Juan Ruiz Anchia who has photographed various James Foley's films . The motion picture was competently directed by James Foley, providing from his standout cast , phenomenal interpretations . He is a good director who has made movies of all kinds of genres with penchant for dramas . As Foley has directed important ajd some successful movies such as : Reckless , At Close Range , After Dark my Sweet , Two Bits , Fear , The Chamber , The Corruptor , Confidence , among others. Rating : 6.5/ 10 . Acceptable and passable movie that will appeal to fans of the extraordinary plethora of actors .",Glengarry Glen Ross
10,moonspinner55,"Blistering, bludgeoning, true-to-life though not at all entertaining...",4,3 April 2008,"Utterly joyless film, scripted by David Mamet from his Pulitzer Prize-winning play, about harried, put-upon real estate agents struggling to satisfy the corporate bosses and keep their jobs, lying to and cheating their clients, their co-workers, and maybe even themselves. Great all-male ensemble does first-rate work (with Alec Baldwin in the newly-written role of the company's Standard Bearer, a demoralizing sales hotshot who sees the workplace as a battlefield); yet, for all their combined brilliance, the material as presented here is difficult to watch. Barbed, ugly, belligerent, it leaves the viewer beaten and bowed. Jack Lemmon's ""Save the Tiger"" only scratched at the surface of these characters' dead-end lives. Director James Foley goes a bit heavy on the rain-drenched pitifulness (his chilly blues and grays become visually monotonous), while Mamet--an intelligent and insightful writer--refuses to let up, giving us no relief from the pummeling deluge of verbal assaults. This is one to admire for its obvious craft and as a showcase for the actors, yet it's not a picture to take to heart. ** from ****",Glengarry Glen Ross
11,Quinoa1984,"One of the best films of 1992, dynamite script and performances",10,22 June 2001,"David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross is a scorching motion picture that depicts the working men, here at a real estate office, where each person is desperate to sell, even if sometimes it doesn't happen (I use sometimes lightly here).  Every performance here is what counts to make Mamet's words work (this was once a play, and you can tell from the language alone).  Pacino is really good as the office hot-shot, always selling even at the point of conning, which usually happens in this line of work.  As usual Harris is great and has another role to add to the great list he has.  However it is Lemmon who steals much of the show here as Shelley Levene (It's one of his best performances to date, which is a lot to say considering his career), who is the loser at the office who tries to sell, but is just starting to get a little too old for the job; that plus the added pressure from a fellow employee, played by Kevin Spacey in such a straight role it is actually an evil part.  And then there's Alec Baldwin, who I can see probably gave a lot of inspiration to Ben Affleck's character in the powerful Boiler Room.  His bit part is small but his most significant part to date.  In his crucial speech scene (the one where he says ""1st place is a car, 2nd place is steak knives and 3rd place, your gone), his character paints the picture for the trouble that is being a salesman.  And that is what so dynamic about the movie.  Not just the acting and writing (which are phenomenal, don't get me wrong), but also the feel that comes with the movie.  It is stunning pretty much all of the way, and very credible.  One note though: please don't watch this movie on television, you will see so much dubbing in the film that not only will it destroy the visceral effect the movie has for the viewer, but the lip readers will get confused.

13,writers_reign,A Dearth Of Salesmen,9,8 May 2006,"And they say film is a Visual Medium; it's also Aural cause if you listen real hard you'll hear the sound of hollow laughter, nor will you have to listen all that hard to realize that this is one of the most dialogue-driven films in the history of the Medium. Nothing strange there since it is, after all, an adaptation of a stage play and a Pulitzer Prize winner at that and writer and director have done the bare minimum to 'open it out' for the screen, venturing from the salesmen's room in the real estate office only briefly and logically to the Chinese restaurant across the street, the alley behind the office, Ed Harris's car and the home of a potential mark. Over and above everything else this is a film about language, the spoken as opposed to the written word or, more specifically the language as she is spoken in the workplace which means the spectrum running from elation to despair with everything in between. With language of this calibre it'd be a pity to waste it on hacks or journeymen actors so step forward colossi, none more so than Jack Lemmon giving on screen a performance to stand beside his James O'Neill on stage in Long Day's Journey Into Night (in which, incidentally, a then much less well-known Kevin Spacey played his older son Jamie). To the best of my knowledge Lemmon never gave a bad performance in his life, frankly the man was incapable of so doing, but his screen acting career was punctuated with a dazzling array of beacons from Ensign Pulver in Mr Roberts through C.C. Baxter in The Apartment via Some Like It Hot, Days Of Wine And Roses, Save The Tiger et al but all were as nothing compared to his Shelley Levene in this great movie which towers above everything else including Alec Baldwin's tour de force, Al Pacino's ruthless closer Ed Harris and Alan Arkadin's professional losers and Kevin Spacey's nepotic ass-kisser. This is a film that works on any level you like with the possible exception of Western or Musical and is virtually impossible to over praise.",Glengarry Glen Ross
14,grantss,"Great character- and dialogue-driven drama, with excellent performances",8,25 December 2015,"Great character- and dialogue-driven drama. Plot is solid, but it is merely a platform for some great lines and performances. This said, the plot does demonstrate the level of cynicism and lack of ethics in the modern office, especially among salesmen. Think of the most irritating salesperson you've ever met, and multiply the sleaze and connivance factor by 1,000 - you'll meet those characters here. Great performances by an all-star cast: Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin, Jonathan Pryce. Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino are perfect as the snake oil salesmen.On the negative side, it can feel a bit dry at times. The movie's origins as a play are obvious, and it sometimes feels as though you are watching a filmed play, rather than a movie.Overall, a great indictment on the lack of ethics and morality in the modern workplace.",Glengarry Glen Ross
15,Boba_Fett1138,A movie filled with verbal action and brilliant acting.,10,4 March 2005,"Has there ever been such a movie with such a brilliant cast? Sure there have been movies before with lots of famous actors in them like ""A Bridge Too Far"" or ""Mars Attacks!"". Diverence is that in ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" all of the actors share most of their screen time together in the same scene's, the result is a true treat for us the viewers. Just imaging a scene in which Al Pacino, Ed Harris and Jack Lemmon are all outclassing each other constantly with every line they speak.But who deserves most credit for this masterpiece? Strangely not anyone of the actors but writer David Mamet does. The dialog in the movie is simply brilliant and make me consider this a 'verbal-action-movie'. Also the characters he created are really solid. Not one is a real 'good guy' and he shows that there is a dark side in everyone of us.I'm a big Al Pacino fan so he easily is my favorite character in the movie but maybe even better acting in this movie is Jack Lemmon. A character that also deserves more credit than it's getting is Ed Harris as Dave Moss. Big surprise in the movie is Kevin Spacey who at the time was a fairly unknown screen actor. Letting him play a big part in a cast filled with some well known names at the time seemed like a big gamble but Spacey reminds us constantly in every scene why he was cast. Alec Baldwin shows up in a unforgettable small role, as the biggest *peep* of them all.You have to be a fan of-and in the right mood to fully appreciate this character movie. Also watch this movie with your head clear, since it is not always easy to follow because of the very much and fast dialog and the fairly high pace of the movie.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Glengarry Glen Ross
16,view_and_review,I feel sorry for salesmen... still hate 'em though,7,12 April 2020,"Man! What a depressing movie. The life of a salesman is tough and by the looks of it, the life of a property salesman is the absolute pits. I've never had much sympathy for the likes of salespersons; they badger you, they interrupt your day, and they lie.I remember when I bought a Kirby vacuum from a door-to-door salesman. He sold my wife on it so I come home and I'm $1800 poorer. They gave us a contract that was 18 months 0%. Well, the bank called and said, ""So, we have a contract here for 12 months 0%.""I said, ""No. It's 18 months 0%.""The bank said, ""We don't do 18 month 0% contracts.""I said, ""Then void it and come get your vacuum.""Ricky (Al Pacino), Shelley (Jack Lemmon), George (Alan Arkin), and Dave (Ed Harris) were in the business of selling property for Premiere Properties, a hole in the wall company in New York. They would do anything to make a sell--and who wouldn't if you depended on it to eat everyday. They are good salesmen, even if they *ahem* bend the truth a little bit, but even a good salesperson needs good leads.I think they said the word ""lead"" about 100 times in the span of an hour and 40 minutes. They wanted the good leads and didn't want the old stale leads. It was a miserable existence.I think the cast of ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" made the matter of property sales about as interesting as could be. The topic itself is not that enthralling, so to make a movie about it in which the audience doesn't go to sleep is admirable. I think all the performances were great, with Jack Lemmon and Pacino being the best. Did I ever feel sorry for them. I'm still shutting down any salesman that tries to pitch me, but I do feel sorry for them.",Glengarry Glen Ross

20,HotToastyRag,Salesmen will find it painful,3,8 February 2019,"Put the kids to bed for this one, because Glengarry Glen Ross is only for the big boys. And by big boys, I mean audience members who can stand tons of shouting, even more cursing, and an upsetting storyline that will hurt. There's a reason Death of a Salesman is such a tearjerker: it hits home for a lot of people. Glengarry Glen Ross has often been compared to that story, and with good reason. It's about four salesmen of varying ages and experiences who are faced with an ultimatum: close the sale or lose his job.I'm not really sure who the target audience is for this movie, or for the Pulitzer Prize winning play by David Mamet. Men who have any experience in the sales force will find this movie too painful to watch. Women who have been married to salesman will find it too painful. Children whose fathers were salesmen will find it too painful. So, you're left with people who have no idea what it's like to be a salesman or the living hell they suffer through every day-why would they want to watch it? The answer, I suppose, is the cast. Alec Baldwin gives the so-called, curse-filled pep talk that threatens everyone's jobs, Kevin Spacey is the cold, smarmy office manager, Jack Lemmon is the veteran salesman you feel sorry for because he doesn't have what it takes anymore, Al Pacino says more curse words than clean words in his monologues, Ed Harris is the young hotshot who's only out for himself, and Alan Arkin personifies ""that guy"" in the office that makes you wonder why he decided to become a salesman in the first place. As you can tell, the film is perfectly cast, and everyone delivers the performance they're supposed to deliver. However, it's still an upsetting movie that would really only appeal to members of the ""Greed Is Good"" club who can detach from the characters and think about all the schemes they'd pull in order to put other people out of work and save themselves.

The tension rises and rises throughout, and you come to realise that these people who call you up all confident and full of buzzwords, are just running on empty, and are as desperate as anyone else.Even Baldwin, all mouth in his short scene, shows off about his salary, his watch, and his car, someone like that has self esteem issues.A brilliant portrayal of working life, and knowing when your time is up.",Glengarry Glen Ross
23,Sylviastel,Too Much Swearing for Me!,8,13 March 2011,"Glengarry Glen Ross is based on the David Mamet play. I haven't seen it. This film is really a masculine film with no female characters in it all. Jack Lemmon's performance is heartbreaking as the desperate salesman trying to close a sale. It's an Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. Al Pacino is great as always. Jonathan Pryce is wonderful in the later scenes. The other salesmen read like the A-list of great actors, Oscar Nominee Ed Harris, Oscar Nominee Alec Baldwin, Oscar winner, Alan Arkin, and two-time Oscar winner, Kevin Spacey too. The story about real estate salesmen is brutal just like business. They are war with each other and the world. Unless they close their deals, they'll be fired by their bosses. I thought Jack Lemmon was the best performance of all. You loved him one minute, pitied him in another minute, and was rooting for him all the time.",Glengarry Glen Ross
24,Mr-Fusion,Enthralling stuff,8,18 February 2015,"Alec Baldwin's scene in ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" is an attention-getter of the highest order. He bursts onto the scene, wastes no time and gets right down to it. His character is abusive, and his tone nothing but caustic, but that's why the ""Always Be Closing"" speech is so memorable. To say nothing of those brass balls, which he takes literally and puts his indelible mark on a movie with such a formidable cast.That scene plays very early on in the movie's running time, but it only gets better from there. The fiery temperament of David Mamet's words alternates between Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris and Al Pacino, each man lighting up the screen in his own time. Pacino and Lemmon both give it their all, but it's Lemmon (for me) who owns this. His exhausting desperation and endless sales drilling is the workhorse performance that shoulders most of the movie.But everyone here has their moment in the sun, and it's amazing what kind of excitement this movie's dialogue can generate.8/10",Glengarry Glen Ross
25,namashi_1,An Amazing Film... Must See!!,9,25 April 2010,"'Glengarry Glen Ross', Adapted by David Mamet from his acclaimed 1984 Pulitzer Prize- and Tony-winning play of the same name, is an Incredible Thriller! An Amazing Film, with a water-tight screenplay and an excellent culmination! It depicts two days in the lives of four real estate salesmen and how they become desperate when the corporate office sends a representative to ""motivate"" them by announcing that, in one week, all except the top two salesmen will be fired! 'Glengarry Glen Ross' which was a box office flop, is one those very-worthy films which didn't get their due. However, it's has devoted a cult following, I loved each and every second I put in to watch this film. James Foley's direction is superb and so Juan Ruiz Anchía's camera-work.Coming to the acting department, Al Pacino steals the show with a hardcore performance. The Legend is simply remarkable! Jack Lemmon is proficient. Alec Baldwin is fantastic in a brief role, this his best work as an actor to date! Kevin Spacey is perfect. Ed Harris is amazing, as always. Alan Arkin is witty and spot-on. Jonathan Pryce is good.'Glengarry Glen Ross' is a Masterpiece! Two Big Thumbs Up!!",Glengarry Glen Ross
26,StevePulaski,Beautifully cynical,9,23 June 2012,"The people depicted in Glengarry Glen Ross are self-centered, despicable rats in the filthiest of sewers. Four men who work in a low-rent, shady real estate office, selling timeshare-like plans to people, or faceless leads, who will buy in. The men are Shelley 'The Machine' Levene (Jack Lemmon), a salesman stuck in a seemingly impenetrable rut, Dave Moss (Ed Harris), who is planning to upstage some sort of a corporate rebuttal against the system, George Aaronow (Alan Arkin), another agent stuck in a rut, and Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), the fiery suit who can close pretty much any deal and is currently the big man in the office.When Blake (Alec Baldwin) is sent by the unseen owners of the business, Mitch and Murray, to give the men a profanity-laced tirade, criticizing them for their work ethic and offering prizes to the ""closers,"" the men become desperate and power-hungry. Blake states that two biggest sellers will be given the promising ""Glengarry leads"" (leads is slang for potential customers) while the other two will be given pink slips. First prize is a new car, second is a set of steak knives, third, you're fired.The leads the men currently have are underwhelming and are tough to deal with. Pacino's Ricky gives a nice commentary to the manager, John Williamson (Kevin Spacey), that dealing with men named ""Patel"" is an absolute nightmare. Williamson doesn't care one bit. He hates the four men with a passion, and is glad that walking papers will be handed to two of them. Desperation and betrayal quickly cloud their judgment, and the next day, it is discovered someone robbed the shop and stole the Glengarry leads.Glengarry Glen Ross is a fiery business drama centering around disloyalty to a company and looming corruption. It is among one of the most intelligent and most poignant pictures of the nineties decade, and occupies some of the finest dialog and performances from then, as well. Al Pacino gives a breakneck performance as Ricky, and kicks in during the last forty minutes which are set entirely in the office, with the camera circling to whoever happens to be speaking. Spacey, who is arguably one of the best ""everyman's"" in film, is stupendous, and the same can be said for Alan Arkin. But the performances I was sold on the most were Jack Lemmon, who unintentionally makes his character sympathetic, despite being a shameful, snaky soul, and Alec Baldwin, whose appearance in the film is less than ten minutes, but carries forth an impact that is truly a lasting one. He tells the office in his verbally abusive speech that they need to ""Always Be Closing and need to remember four things when striking a deal; Attention, Interest, Decision, and Action. Baldwin's delivery is rock solid and was worthy of an Oscar nominee, which the Academy sadly overlooked. I thought if he would've appeared a few more times during the film it would've been apparent he got a nomination. But that's the beauty of his performance - he shows up, bats off obscenities, passes judgment, and then walks out the door. What a beautifully cynical performance he gives.The whole film can be summed up by the phrase, ""beautifully cynical."" It paints a bleak, gray portrait of the real estate world, how foggy and grim it really is, where desperation, thievery, and cloudy negotiations cut through honesty and devotion. The picture was based on a play by the film's screenwriter, David Mamet, and looks and feels every bit like one. It has only a handful of basic settings, cut-throat characters, some of the sharpest monologues out there, and the time just fleets past you. Glengarry Glen Ross is a deeply involving gem of a picture, all leading up to a heartless and involving conclusion. It's a shame a great film by all these actors today is seldom seen.Starring: Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, and Jonathan Pryce. Directed by: James Foley.",Glengarry Glen Ross
27,MovieAddict2016,One of the best films of its kind,9,28 April 2005,"I love movies like this. Theatre-styled motion pictures driven by dialog versus action. Get a few guys together in a room, watch them talk -- I have a soft spot for this stuff. I have ever since I can remember. Some of my favorite films are character-driven ones: ""The Hustler,"" ""The Big Kahuna,"" ""Midnight Run,"" ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles."" At first glance this list seems skeptical -- but basically all these films follow the same central theme: clever dialog, character interaction and evolution, and depth.""Glengarry Glen Ross"" is one of the best of the genre. Scripted by David Mamet, the dialog never hits and weak patches -- it is realistic, extremely fun to listen to, and the actors all deliver flawless performances.Al Pacino finally finds the perfect role to let himself vent (as he started to do in ""Scent of a Woman"" the same year, and won an Oscar for -- he deserved it more for this). Pacino has some great one-liners and quips, but he never seems too broad to find believable.Jack Lemmon is similarly impressive, in what he called one of his favorite films of his entire career. Lemmon abandoned his comedic roots for this drama and it paid off -- he's not only an excellent funnyman, but a great actor.Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, and Alec Baldwin fill out the rest of the cast and all do very well; especially Baldwin in a brief cameo. I've never had much consideration for Baldwin as an actor, but his five minutes' worth of screen time here reminded me that when he's good, he really IS good! Overall ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" is not only one of my favorite films of the genre but also a solid movie by any means. If you aren't bored by movies in which people talk instead of running around defusing bombs, you'll probably really get a kick out of this.",Glengarry Glen Ross
28,Red-Barracuda,Extremely well-acted tragedy about men on the edge,6,8 June 2011,"You'll be hard-pushed to find a film with a better selection of power-house top drawer acting than Glengarry Glen Ross. This truly is an actors films if ever there was one. While the storyline isn't overly interesting, the chief selling point of this film is in the performances. Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Alec Baldwin and Jonathan Pryce are all excellent in characterisations that are multi-layered and believable. In particular it's great to see Lemmon in such a raw role, he pulls it off immaculately; while Baldwin proves he's got more talent than you might expect in an explosive ten minute appearance. Writer David Mamet has to be given a lot of credit here in providing all of the actors with a strong script to work off in the first place. The film is full of profanity-laden tough talking by men seemingly on the edge of nervous breakdowns. The general atmosphere of the film is one of hopelessness and despair. It's not exactly a happy ride but it is a satisfying one. This is undoubtedly not a film that will appeal to everyone, seeing as it's theatrical trappings and dialogue-driven narrative will not be to all tastes. Although despite the limited locations, the film is well shot and lit, while the jazz score gives it a mournful mood that adds a lot to proceedings.Overall a very impressive emsemble piece. If you appreciate plays then this is a really good example of a cinematic presentation of such. It's more about acting and writing than cinema but don't let that put you off.",Glengarry Glen Ross
29,sddavis63,Who'd Have Thought Real Estate Could Make A Good Movie,8,25 March 2007,"I decided to watched this movie because of the outstanding cast. Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Alan Arkin, Alec Baldwin. With those names, this movie couldn't fail. And it didn't. It isn't a high tension corporate espionage type thriller. In fact in many ways it's not that exciting. A lot of the movie is set simply inside a real estate office. But the movie portrays perfectly the problem of corporate greed, in which numbers are more important than people, and where successes of the past are quickly and easily forgotten in the cold, hard reality of ""what have you done for me lately?""The sales staff (with the exception of Roma - Pacino) is struggling, and so a heavy hitter from ""downtown"" - Baldwin - is called in to read the riot act to them. Baldwin only appears in the first few minutes of the movie, by the way, but he nailed the part perfectly and left a lasting impression. Basically the message was ""sell, or you're gone in a week."" The reactions of the various salesmen and how they handle the pressure is what makes the movie. I had different reactions to each one. Moss (Ed Harris) came across as throughly unlikeable - a whiner and a manipulator who seems to want to get away with doing as little as possible and who doesn't have the guts to get his own hands dirty. Aaronov (Alan Arkin) came across as a decent guy who probably was totally past his prime but couldn't imagine not being in real estate. Williamson (Spacey) seemed exactly as the other characters seemed to portray him: not exactly up to the job given him as office manager. Not surprisingly, the movie revolved around Levene (Lemmon) and Roma. Roma is the typical super salesman. He'll win some and he'll lose some and in the end he'll be fine. His biggest concern wasn't losing his job; it was losing out on the Cadillac promised to the most successful salesman! He really wanted that car and the prestige that accompanied being Number One! Levene was the tragic character in the movie. A former sales star displaced by Roma, he's struggling, he has an institutionalized daughter whose medical expenses are high and he needs this job badly. Of all the characters, he's the one you root for, and, in the end, the most memorable line in the movie came from a conversation between Levene and Williamson. Williamson gives him a useless lead: someone who'll buy anything but has no money to pay for it. Levene makes the sale and thinks he's on top again, then discovers the truth. Then:LEVENE: Why would you do this to me? WILLIAMSON: Because I don't like you!Those two lines just seemed to sum up so much of what this movie was trying to say.The dramatic tension comes eventually from the theft of prime sales leads. Who stole them? Which one of these guys was desperate enough to do it? It may not be the most exciting story ever, but your attention will not waver until you find out. 8/10",Glengarry Glen Ross
30,theowinthrop,The bottom line is signing on the dotted line.,10,2 October 2007,"It was my luck to see this David Mamet play on Broadway about 1990, with Vincent Gardenia (as Shelley Levine - Jack Lemmon's role) heading a first rate cast. I liked it, but when the movie came out in 1992 I failed to see it at the time. This despite the fact that it's ensemble cast was considered as having done a great job in the film version by most of the film critics. Yet, despite this fanfare, except for nominating Al Pacino for best actor (for the role of hotshot salesman Ricky Roma), the Academy Awards did not note the film at all, and Pacino lost that year.But GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS really does not require ""Oscar"" recognition to remain among the top ten ensemble casts movie jobs in American film. It also is an intriguing look at the world of salesmen at it's most intense. The salesmen here are real estate salesmen (""Glengarry Glen Ross"" are two valuable pieces of real estate the firm is planning to start selling soon - and a set of valuable customer leads on these properties are at the center of the story). Besides Levine and Roma, the other salesmen in the firm are Moss (Ed Harris) and Aaronov (Alan Arkin). This particular office of the multi-state realty firm is run by Williamson (Kevin Spacey). Part of the wildness of the film is that Williamson's style is not tolerant of the boy's club boasting and tricks of the sales force - tricks, by the way, that are not working as well as they used to.Sales are generally down, and the firm's partners send legendary super-salesman Blake (Alec Baldwin) to give a talk to the salesman. Blake is not standing for the old war stories of these blow hearts. He tells them how low they are all viewed by the top management, and is giving them a contest which is really an ultimatum: In one week whoever makes the most sales will be given a Eldorado as first prize. Second prize is a set of cheap steak knives. Everyone else outside of those two places will lose their jobs as failures.The salesmen are hard working, but there have been problems with properties they have to unload, as well as the fact that the leads dished out are hardly first rate. But if they were top notch salesmen they would be able to sell these properties - and they all claim that they are.Best is Roma - the hotshot salesman, who we see managing to download worthless, overpriced land on one Lingk (Jonathan Pryce) over drinks in a Chinese restaurant. He seems most assured of coming in first place. Levine is a once good salesman of some years earlier, but of late things keep falling between his fingers. Aaronov is an honest plodder, a tortoise to Roma's hare, but he has been turning in very few sales himself. As for Moss, he strikes the viewer as a constant complainer, and one gets the impression he really is not very good at his job.Roma is certain the Lingk sale will put him into the top slot. Then Levine comes in having made an $82,000.00 sale to an elderly couple (the huge amount is that it would be for 8 apartment units - like a small apartment house). They are wildly congratulating each other, when they learn the offices of Williamson were burgled during the night, and that some of the Glengarry leads were stolen. This jeopardizes both sales because of the police investigation going on.The film strips the entire cast of pretenses. Baldwin's part is relatively short (just one massive scene at the start - written for him for the film not the play). He is crude, vulgar, but direct. He does not care about events from fifteen years back that they might talk of - it's today that counts. His putting Moss into his place by pointing out his watch is worth more than Moss' current automobile is proof that however nasty his speech is it happens to be true. It was a wonderful cameo role for Baldwin.Lemmon's Levine is like Willy Loman, only a little younger. He knows how to lie and cheat customers with the best, but he has had problems with his daughter that have preoccupied him of late. But that is the same type of sentiment that Loman found is not part of the business ethic. Pacino's Roma is Lemmon's admirer, and they have the closest thing to a real friendship in that office. In fact, when Pacino is having problems with Pryce (having second thoughts on the sale after a talk with his wife), Lemmon actually tries to help Pacino out in a complicated lie. Harris' Moss is a slimy type - he tries to get Arkin into a scheme to steal the Glengarry leads from Spacey's office, even suggesting that Arkin is an accomplice after the fact no matter whether he'll do it or not. Arkin is a nervous type - a plodder - but both basically honest and also aware of his small caliber personality that can't gain respect from anyone (his one tirade is confronted by an increasingly annoyed Spacey who basically orders him to go out and have lunch!). As for Spacey, he is aware that his powers are only meted out from above, and he does what is ethical to the clients in an unethical business (we never hear what Baldwin tells him about his office management). But his openness with customers ends up screwing things for at least one salesman, and the whole pack feel he's a waste. Actually he turns out to be the smartest in the office.Despite Mamet's joyous use of foul language, GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS remains a marvelous ensemble work for stage and film, and a remarkably honest view of what really matters, in the end, in American business.",Glengarry Glen Ross

Lumpkin Mitch & Murray, the Wall Street real-estate conglomerate, is not too happy about the production of that branch and sends down one of their top honcho's Mr. Blake, Alic Baldwin, to motivate the men to get the ball rolling and start putting dollars on the blackboard.In a pep talk that leaves the crew panic-stricken Blake tells them if they don't start to sell real-estate and get the office out of debt only one of them will be left working for the firm by the end of the month, the one who has the most sales. Blake gives the manager of the office John Williamson, Kevin Spacey,a list of valuable live leads, people who are very likely to buy, and tells him to give them out to the most productive salesman who's on top of the blackboard, in money earned, by the end of the day. with that the men who are drowning see a lifeline and will do anything that they can, right or wrong, to grab it. Explosive performances all around with everyone in the cast giving it all they've got in a great movie about salesmen on par with ""Death of a Salesman"".

32,Lejink,Hard-hitting sell,8,24 September 2013,"Like many of the reviewers here, I have worked all my life in financial services including five years in estate agency, the UK equivalent to the real estate plots ruthlessly and selfishly sold to unsuspecting cold-called members of the public by the pack of salesmen here. That said I never had to make the intrusive and deceptive calls made here, the guys throwing any devious line to try to get themselves in front of the target investor and then use every other trick in the book to extract their money in exchange for dubiously profitable areas of land. That's not to say I can't relate to a lot of what goes on here, from the can't- sell-so-I'll-supervise office boss Kevin Spacey, to the high-flying, top-dog salesman Al Pacino and desperate veteran seller Jack Lemmon. In this hard day's night of this particular office, no emotion is left unspared in this frank exposure of the sales culture endemic in the ""Greed is Good"" 80's and early 90's.Did they have to swear so much and use such appalling language throughout the film. I know it's part of writer David Mamet's M.O. to embrace profanity and use it as part of the rhythmic language he puts in the mouths of his characters, but it is excessive in the extreme and even in this man's man's man's world, (there are no female leads here), goes too far over the top for my taste, plus I can't imagine any office manager tolerating the abuse Specey's character cos here. The plot seems contrived too at times, especially the theft of the ""golden-ticket"" leads and the minor whodunit surprise left to the end. I'd also argue that characters like Ed Harris's rebellious salesman and Alex Baldwin's ferocious sales manager are underused in the narrative, plus I certainly didn't follow every vernacular phrase banded about by theses fast (I won't call them sweet) - talkers.Better then to comment on the superb ensemble acting, with only Pacino guilty of his traditional sin of overacting. The rest, familiar faces though they are, I got as desperate, hard-pressed salesman but Pacino's florid, mannered performance is at odds with the gun-barrel down-to-earth acting of everyone else, with the director not having too much more to do than point the camera at the actors and stand back.Intense, compulsive and believable, if slightly flawed, this is a fine modern day parable of the self-self-self generation .

33,ElMaruecan82,"Baldwin, Lemmon, Spacey, Pacino, Arkin and Harris are the ""6 Angry Men"" ... ...",8,1 May 2013,"""Glengarry Glen Ross"" left me with mixed feelings regarding real estate salesmen. The depiction of their dishonest tactics was so bold, accurate and eye opening that I wondered if salesmen weren't the epitome of the word 'manipulation'. Yet, I also felt sorry for them because their eagerness to sell was often proportional to desperateness. And Jack Lemmon's performance as Shelley Levene is essential to understand the pressure endured by these men who can go from 'closers' to losers in the blink of an eye.It's a rotten, nasty and hypocrite world indeed where Levene used to be the top-dog before slipping into mediocrity and desperately trying to reconquer a lost glory. Levene is renowned by the Simpsons fans, for having inspired the recurrent character of Gil Gunderson: the poor schmuck who could never sell anything. Gil made his first appearance in the episode where Marge worked as a real estate agent. Her boss Lionel Hutz then revealed the unforgettable secret: ""the right house is the house you sell, and the right person is anyone"". The opening speech delivered by Alec Baldwin echoes Hutz' paradigm with such closeness it's almost scary. As Blake, the slick hot-shot from the office owners, Alec Baldwin sets the tone by assessing the new rules of the game: everyone must sell to the leads he's assigned to in one week, to get access to the cherished Glengarry leads. The first prize is a Cadillac, the second a set of knives, the third one is ""you're fired"". Far from the inspirational-trainer model, Baldwin exemplifies the dictatorship of results, valuable for any other business, such a vital issue he doesn't even embarrass himself with courtesy. I work in a real estate company, but even before, I knew men like this and the painful truth is the following: if you're touched b their words, you're the winning type, if you're exasperated by the contempt they display and the way they exploit wealth as an alibi for competence: you're not cur for the business. Naturally, the employees are all upset and we're tempted to empathize with them. I even related to their constant nagging about the leads' weaknesses, because I had to deal with their issues, and quickly learned when a 'no' meant 'no'. In one of the film's most memorable scenes, Levene tries to convince a reluctant buyer and while he's cordially invited to leave the house, there's so much despair in Lemmon's eyes I felt he was at the verge of cracking up and starting to beg on his knees. And as we go deeper in the man's motives, we feel more indulgent, but James Foley's directing conveys a shadowy and film-noir vibe, as if we were following gangsters, which takes all its relevance when Ed Harris and Alan Arkin contemplate easier ways to get money. Paraphrasing ""The Godfather Part II"", 'this is the business they've chosen'.""Glengarry Glen Ross""' plot is complex, but it's fascinating how the complexity is governed by men who're put to extreme limits, it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe, the eternal ends justifying the means. The whole business is rotten and even if we try to empathize, we witness the blatant manipulation of a weak customer. The manipulator is Ricky Roma, played by Al Pacino, (who was Oscar-nominated for the role) sensing the insecurity of his client, after long philosophical monologues about love and life, in fact, a Machiavellian exercise in seduction to lure him into signing the contract the same night. We understand why he is the best, and how significant his absence was during Blake's speech; he was above the flood of insults his unfortunate colleagues received.To complete the cast ensemble, Kevin Spacey is Williamson, the in-between manager who crystallizes all the hatred and not without reasons: never on the sit, least experienced yet the one in the safest place thanks to his connections. No more or less jerk than the others though, Williamson indirectly mirrors the innate hypocrisy of their jobs: treated with respect when his services are needed or like crap the rest of the time. The script features different layers of corruption and moral flaws finally exploding when pressure is too much to take, in a cinematic blaze of energy, humor, anger and loads of some of the most memorable F-bombs ever shouted in a film, especially from Ed Harris who personifies the bitterness and anger of the average worker who can't take it anymore.""Glengarry Glen Ross"" is remarkably acted, directed and written, one of the best play-to-film adaptation, resonating like a modern ""12 Angry Men"". It's easy to tell that David Mamet 'knew the ropes' when he wrote the dialogs, the script hasn't lost one ounce of significance especially during our days of economical crisis. And Lemmon, in a heart-braking performance, highlights the limits one man can pushed up to, for money, and the sometimes exhilarating, sometimes devastating, but always corrupting effect of 'winning'. I can't understand how neither Jack Lemmon nor David Mamet were Oscar-nominated. Pacino was great but as a scene-stealer, Lemmon was the soul of the film, and this performance is one of his career's highlights, with a wide range of emotions sometimes displayed in one scene.And I still can't get over his teary eyes while saying ""my daughter"" as a last-ditch attempt to gain Spacey's sympathy. But being 'the Machine' doesn't prevent from being victim of 'machinations' and Spacey's answer made me realize why the film is so full of profanity. I said in the review ""it might start with charm, evolve into threats, but sooner or later, it comes to bribe"" in fact, I forgot the ultimate step which consists on two words, and one of them is the F-one.It's only fitting that the most repeated line of the film is the one that best sums up the nastiness of the world it's plunging us into.",Glengarry Glen Ross
34,Pjtaylor-96-138044,For closers.,7,12 March 2021,"Despite its unnecessary mouth-full of a title, ' Glengarry Glen Ross (1992)' is essentially a solid example of a chamber piece, set primarily in two locations and taking place over the course of a few hours. This is obviously because of its stage-play roots, yet it never feels as though it's confined by its limited locations and small cast of characters. This is largely thanks to Foley's solid direction, which constantly comes across as cinematic while still highlighting what made the original story work so well: its dialogue. Most of that dialogue is lifted straight from Mamet's initial version by Mamet himself. It's fast-paced and unforgiving, mimicking real speech while actually being quite far away from it. It gives the movie's fantastic cast something to work with, and work with it they do. The performances here are fantastic; Lemmon, Harris and Pacino turn in some of their absolute best work (which is no small feat, that's for sure). The thing doesn't seem overly showy, even though it is. Instead, it just seems urgent and of-the-now, its players constantly clawing at each other's throats and its power dynamics shifting constantly. It's an impressive feat. It's also oddly enjoyable. It barely lets up for a second and is mostly comprised of shouting, but it's bizarrely compelling. It's a distinct, entertaining experience. 7/10",Glengarry Glen Ross

I remember watching the scene with Alec Baldwin before but apparently forgot what movie it came from. I was so pleasantly surprised to see it here again! I remember an Al Pacino soundboard with him saying he was Richard Roma and once again, I had no clue this was the movie where it came from. It was so cool to see these little video and audio clips I had seen and heard before come to life here! Anyway, the movie's only fault is probably how Alec Baldwin should have appeared more.I thought he was going to be the new boss in this company, but he was just there as a motivational speaker. Al Pacino of course makes this movie. I was really impressed at how they took such an adult concept and put it in a movie that was only 100 minutes long. Normally, you'd think a film that iconic with such big name actors would be long and epic. I'm not complaining at all. This movie was still great and I loved how it seemed to be really saying something about business. I'm not into real estate or big stuff like that, but I did think it's something most workers can identify with. It's worth its reputation, even if I couldn't identify it at first. ***1/2",Glengarry Glen Ross
36,ironhorse_iv,This movie is a powerful message about greed and ambition in America Capitalism. It's worth the watch.,8,27 January 2016,"This movie wasn't a hard sale to me. Full of morality bankrupt, profanity spitting, corrupt characters trying to survive in a harsh environment like real estate made a worthwhile watch for me. I was going to see this movie, no matter what. After seeing it, this movie adds up to be, one of the most fearless uncompromising films, I ever saw, on the dark side of the America capitalism. Directed by James Foley, the movie follows the group of everyday real estate salesmen: Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), Shelley Levine (Jack Lemmon), George Aaronow (Alan Arkin), & Dave Moss (Ed Harris) being forced, by an a group of aggressive representative from the corporate office, in office manager, John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) & William Blake (Alec Baldwin) to sell more property or be fired if they fail. Driven by the ""always be closing"" mentality, the stress of their job, will ultimately pushes the characters into new ground of dishonestly and corrupted in order to save their job. Indeed, every dream has a price, but the question, is it really worth it? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this is one of the greatest acting ensemble cast, I have ever seem. While, all of the real estate characters do seem a bit shallow, unlikeable and too mean-spirited. I just glad, the film had all-well fine actors in it, so you would stick around, and watch the characters, rather than getting turn off, by their actions. All of the actors in this film, were masters in their own sense of style and work. I love how Kevin Spacey was able to make the jump from theater work to film. I love how Alan Arkin was able to expand his character's back-story. I love how Ed Harris was able to put his words, in, despite originally getting the fewer amount of scenes in the original play. I also love how Al Pacino was even able to show up for this film, despite originally not being able, too. However, I love Jack Lemmon's performance in the film, the most. His performance was so good that the Simpson's create a character call Gil Gunderson in his honor. Even Alec Baldwin, whom character wasn't even in the original Broadway stage-play was amazing! I love the tone and delivery of his famous speech. It remind me, so much of ""Greed is good' type monologues from 2000's Boiler Room, 2013's Wolf of Wall Street & 1987's Wall Street! I also love how David Mamet's screenplay considerably expanded his original play script for this movie. It provide more context of the pressure placed on the salesmen. Many critics, consider the screenplay to be far superior than, the Pultizer Prize winning original text; and I agree with that statement. Ever since its release, the film has been used to train real life salesmen how to sell and how not to sell. However, the movie does have some flaws. Since, the movie is based on the 1984 Tony winning stage play of the same name, it's limited to a few location sites. For a movie about selling real estates; you rarely see any of the sites like Clear Meadows, Glengarry Highlands and Glen Ross Farms, at all. Not only does most of the movie take place in the dull looking main office, but most of the film's astrosphere is depressing and gloomy. Nothing, but rain. Still, I have to give the movie some credit. Its melancholy tone does match with the jazz music that composer James Newton Howard, fish out for this film. I just wish, this movie wasn't limited by the amount of characters actors. Due to this, it feels weird, never to see, certain important characters like Doctor Ravadem Patel, Jerry Graff, the Nyborg couple or even the business partners, Mitch & Murray. You would think, that they would, at least, have a few scenes with them. We don't even see, any female characters in the film at all; only mentions. Not having important characters like James Lingk & Larry Spennel's wife, seem kinda wrong. It's also very odd, how uber masculine, this movie is. Seeing how in the real-life, 1990s, there is more female real estate professionals than men working that in field. You would think, there would be, at least, one female agent, but no! Because of this, the movie does seem, a little bit of a sausage feast. While, the movie can seem a bit unrealistic, due to a real estate office being able to yell and spit out that much profanity at each other, without getting fired. I just glad, most of the dialogue wasn't boring. Still, there were some parts, that felt like I was listening to a telemarketer, non-stop. Because of this, I kinda felt like the pacing for this film was indeed, drawn out and tedious. It really takes forever to get anywhere or establish anything. Since, the movie had so much salesman lingo and pitches, the movie could also, be a bit confusing at times. The most confusing scene in the film has to be the talk between James Lingk (Jonathan Pryce) and Richard Roma. A lot of people are saying that both men are gay due to the sexual references in his speech. However, as I see it, Roma smartly trying to use that, to seduce him into a sale. It's nothing more than lying and exploitation. This scene shows the dangers of American Capitalism. You really can't trust, a salesman with anything. Overall: This animalistic movie is a must watch. If you like the 1969's documentary, Salesman, 1985's Death of a Salesman or 1987's Tin Men, I think you would love this movie as well. So check it out. It's an extremely well-acted tragedy about men being force on the edge.",Glengarry Glen Ross
37,kenjha,Acting 101,8,28 September 2010,"In tough economic times, agents at a real estate firm engage in cut-throat competition. Based on a play by Mamet, this very much looks like a filmed play as it consists of little more than people talking, often delivering monologues. While the premise does not seem like a particularly good idea for a film, it works here because the dialog is interesting and the stellar cast delivers terrific performances. It's a tour-de-force of ensemble acting, with Pacino, Lemmon, Arkin, and Harris doing a great job of conveying the desperation of their situation. In what is little more than a cameo, Baldwin chews out the sales staff (and the scenery) as a management consultant.",Glengarry Glen Ross

We watch the pressure and the difficulties that the salesmen face everyday in their job and what they have to do in order to sale as many leads as they can. The direction which was made by James Foley was very good and he presented very well the lives of the salesmen from the inside, with their highs and their lows and he made a very good combination of both good and bad salesmen. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to admit that Jack Lemmon who played as Shelley Levene, Ed Harris who played as Dave Moss and Al Pacino who played as Ricky Roma were simply amazing. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Kevin Spacey's who played as John Williamson and gave a different touch in the movie.",Glengarry Glen Ross
39,Petey-10,David Mamet's play as a film- with the finest actors in the biz,9,13 September 2010,"In a New York real-estate office four men are doing their best to make sales.Blake comes in the office and announces that only two will be allowed access to the more promising Glengarry leads.The rest will get the sack.Dave Moss comes up with a plan to steal the Glengarry leads and sell them to competing real estate agency.But he needs a partner.David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross was a Pulitzer and Tony Prize winning play in 1984.Then in 1992 James Foley directed it as a movie.What this movie has to offer is the finest acting by some big time pros.I especially loved all the Jack Lemmon moments as a long time fan.His performance as once so great Shelley ""The Machine"" Levene is most memorable.When he goes out trying to make a sale or when he feels satisfaction after believing he has made a great sale are those kind of moments that really show what a great actor Mr. Lemmon was.He did win the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival, which he totally deserved.Al Pacino is Ricky Roma, the best salesman there is.He does great job as always.Ed Harris does excellent job as loudmouth salesman Dave Moss.Kevin Spacey is very good as the manager who's not much liked at the office.Alan Arkin is terrific as George Aaronow, an aging salesman with low self-esteem.Jonathan Pryce gives a great performance as Roma's client James Lingk, a depressed middle-aged man.Alec Baldwin makes a short but memorable visit as Blake, a sales strategist, whose job is to motivate the salesmen with some questionable methods.James Newton Howard is behind the music.The writing work done by David Mamet is genius.The characters it depicts are very interesting people with their flaws.Mamet did actually work in a real estate office in the 1970's, so there's a personal level in the whole thing.I found the VHS of this film for 50 cents last year.I really enjoyed watching it and all those actors playing their parts.And who wouldn't?",Glengarry Glen Ross
40,leplatypus,This is the final struggle (dvd),7,1 June 2013,"as it's a play adaptation, I was a bit afraid that the movie would be dull and slow as in most cases, the sets and action are limited and it's above all about long talks and speeches. Here, however, those handicaps are avoided: sure, the sets and action are still poor but we alternate a rainy night and a sunny day thus the atmosphere is gripping. Then, it's not about the usual sentimental relationships but about the working place.At last, a movie that says that working, for a lot of people, is a bit like slavery. And in that view, the casting is indeed perfect: as it's an opposition between human, kind workers and robotic, cold, capitalist bosses, the production has chosen well: my long time despised, unpleasant actors are among the boss (Baldwin, Spacey) while compassionate, kind and rebellious actors are among the abused workers (Pacino, Lemon, Harris). Even, the fragile client is good with Price having the part.Their occupation is also wisely chosen as commercial sellers are part con men, having to sell what we don't need: This dirty trick of the job is well played as each seller has its own way: Lemon is old school, very kind but with boring speech, Harris is like the fox and Pacino is the wise man, disillusioned but also helpful. The bosses are what they are expected to be: without heart and only interested in profits. The opening speech by Baldwin is totally violent and the worst is that's the speech of today bosses: you get me more money or you are fired; I'm the boss with unimaginable money because I'm worth it! Sure, it's totally crap and it was good to see the sellers strikes back. If I have a disappointment, it's maybe with the ending that refuses any outcome: as Lemon is finally caught red-handed and looked like a bit desperate and neurotic all along the movie, the shameful situation he has reached should have been unbearable: thus, I would have written the finale as Lemon going the office with the boss and police and then, we would have heard a gunshot: doors open: Lemon lies on the floor covered with blood as he took the gun from a policeman and killed himself. On the movie, the door closes and nothing happened it's a pity.In all cases, it's a recommendation as it's not usual to have an American movie that glorifies the simple workers and it's also brilliantly played. NB: De Palma would have been inspired to took a look at this movie before filming ""Passion"" as his vision of a firm is so totally silly that it hurts the movie!",Glengarry Glen Ross

42,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Incredible ensemble makes ""Glengarry"" adaptation an easy sell",8,2 November 2009,"If Michael, Magic and Larry, etc. became the first ever ""Dream Team"" of basketball players in 1992, then the cast of the ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" should be considered the ""Dream Team"" of male acting. There's Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, Jonathan Pryce and Alec Baldwin. You won't find seven better names in an opening credit sequence.Together they make up the all-male cast of the film adaptation of David Mamet's play and they lend it the sheer power that this exploration of human nature through the eyes of desperate salesmen might not have otherwise had.It's no surprise director James Foley was incredible wary of taking a story that clearly belongs on the stage and turning into into a film. ""Glengarry"" is dialogue-driven and there's absolutely no physical action in the entire script, which takes place in less than 24 hours real time. It relies heavily on impassioned monologues and the morally ambiguous characters delivering them.The film's first major scene features an angry speech from Baldwin meant to fire up a group of slimy, foul-mouthed real-estate salesmen, explaining that whoever finishes top in sales wins a Cadillac and the loser gets fired. Firm boss Williamson (Spacey) hands the men tired leads and they complain that without the new Glengarry leads, they won't sell a thing.The highlight is a 66-year-old Jack Lemmon as Shelley Levene. I'm baffled at the fact that he received no Oscar nomination considering his status with the Academy. Levene is completely desperate: he works the old leads until he can't anymore, tries to bribe Williamson for Glengarry leads and Lemmon absolutely nails the obnoxious salesman who always has some cheap maneuver in his back pocket. Instead, Pacino got the nomination as Ricky Roma, the hotshot salesman with a serious attitude. He's excellent, but we've seen Pacino with that kind of command numerous times before.""Glengarry"" is a tough film, but Foley and this amazing cast sell you on it the best they can. The story leans on its characters, the talent playing them and the illustrative and attention- seizing monologues they deliver and it can lean away considering those aspects are like impervious steel. There's no way the film could be handled any better. Foley gives maximum effort to provide the most compelling angles for the dialogue, shots that will reveal as much character as possible and stimulate audience thinking. Its very open-ended themes will connect with only a chunk of its viewers, but you have to admire the absolute power that this amassing of talent commands on the screen. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",Glengarry Glen Ross

45,videorama-759-859391,The impossible sell,8,9 October 2016,"My father was a salesman for years. Amway, Jojoba, Legal And General, Ocean Salvage, etc. I would go out with him, a few times at night, and I would sit waiting, may'be two hours. on some occasions. He would come out, holding it in his stride. Had he stirred interest in a potential client, or was it a no show. He had me wondering every time. He was a good bloody salesman, in one job that's bloody hard, where patience and perseverance are tested. You get this vibe, of such such utter desperation, all through this film, set in a rundown real estate office, a perfect set piece, where across the street is their watering hole/Chinese restaurant, which took me back to Cadillac Man. At the moment, things are pretty down at Mitch and Murray, this downtown real estate office, in lower area of New York, where jobs are on the line, and it's employees are given an ear bashing and a hard and nasty word from a boss (Baldwin-explosive and intense) outside of this office. He makes a meal of the role, savoring every moment of his screen time. This cameo, we thanks him as much as we did, Matthew McConaughey's in The Wolf Of Wall Street. Yes, it's harder to sell that great sell and speech. The real thing that works here is the utter desperation of these guys, trying to make a buck, where their potential clients, and no so potential ones, who are sucking them dry, especially Lemmon's wonderfully played character, where one feels his desperation, most. He's acting is top pro, done to such perfection and solid conviction, you don't want to tamper with it, in any way. This character has a lot to worry about. That scene with him, sweet talking the husband of a woman client, where minutes later, he practically shoves the door on him, was so sincere and believable, you would see this scenario happening right in front of you. We have a couple of potentials who turn out to be cuckoo. Things have got so bad, some of our employees, hungry for these new leads, these ""Glengarry leads"" and are willing to steal, where one resorts to just this, but who could it be. Bring on the thriller element. GGR is compelling viewing all the way through, as are the actors brilliant performances, Al Pacino's character, of course, as hotshot Richard Roma, stealing the limelight, where I too, loved Spacey, as the weak minded galah, running the place, where evidently, this guy shouldn't be. You learn too, salesmen can be such backstabbers, towards their colleague's backs. I was much fascinated by Harris's character, as the much angry and jealous, hotheaded employee, with a sort of bullying nature, his great performance was stacked up beside the others. GGR is driven excitedly by dialogue and commanding acting, where the actual movie script, is almost description non existent, but we know we're safe here, when we're in the hands of David Mamet. You'll love the film as much as Pacino's voracious moments, and outbursts. The film has been done solid, thanks to the acting and script, and too done under the wonderful direction and watchful eye of a versatile director, who makes movies, that I like. If you're a talk show host, you should see Talk Radio, if you're in real estate, you should see Glengarry Glen Ross.",Glengarry Glen Ross

The entire film consists of a group of desperate real estate salesman sitting around at the office, in a car, in a phone booth, at a bar; simply sitting and talking, and not doing particularly much. An early morning burglary occurs during the film, but we don't get to see that. The characters just talk. They get angry, they utter countless obscenities to express their frustration, and they each get into a highly-vocal confrontation with each member of the all-male cast at least once. Herein lies the film's brilliance.If ever there was a film with the perfect ensemble cast, this one is it. Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin Everybody involved plays their character to blissful perfection, and not an ounce of talent goes to waste. David Mamet's grittily realistic script is snappy enough to rival anything that Tarantino or the Coen Brothers have ever written, and the actors exploit this to its full potential. Watching these stunning performances is a simply mesmerising experience, and the running time flew by so unbelievably quickly that I came out wishing it had gone on for twice as long.'Glengarry Glen Ross' covers two days in the life of a real estate salesman (or, more accurately, one night and the following morning). The film dashes about between the characters; people come and go as they please. As such, it is difficult to determine a leading character, though Jack Lemmon's Shelley Levene undoubtedly forms the film's backbone. In past years, ""The Machine"" Levene was a powerful force within the company, the most successful salesman for eight months of the year, three years' running. However, now he's experiencing what he describes as a ""bad streak,"" and faces being fired if he doesn't accomplish anything profitable in the very near future. Being laid off would probably prove a relief for Levene, but his daughter is in need of an operation, and he needs the money to support her. Lemmon is absolutely perfect in the role, cutting effortlessly between despair and desperation, fear and elation. We are sympathetic towards his plight, but Levene ultimately embodies those qualities that we detest in a human being  he will cheat, lie and steal, without even a moment's consideration for the wellbeing of his ""victims."" All that matters to him is getting clients to sign on that dotted line. This effectively describes every character in the film.If watching characters simply talk to each other for 90 minutes can be this unbelievably captivating, then why do we even need anything to happen in our films?!

Naturally, given a cast so drenched with talent, the audience is going to want to see them flaunt their acting chops, and thankfully, that's the key to this entire production. Without a tight band of intense, versatile, believable characters at its core there's no chance a plot that revolves around sales calls and a bland office robbery would be anything more than a snoozer. But in this cast's hands, with this combination of sharp, passionate dialog and sleazy, self-serving lack of morality, it's totally entrancing. Like many play-to-film interpretations, there is a certain amount of stagnation in terms of the film's scenery. The vast majority of the action takes place in a sales office, with phone calls, police interviews and (de)motivational speakers providing the flavor. Those tame surroundings work in a variety of unusual ways, though: as a means to ground the story in reality, an exercise in diverting our attention solely to the acting, and a device to give the rare peeks outside the office's not-so-friendly confines an added dash of color.

57,philip_vanderveken,"Even when you aren't in sales, you should give this movie a try",7,7 June 2005,"Being a salesman myself, I was very interested in this movie. It doesn't happen every day that you get to see a movie about your own profession (except for when you are a drugs dealer, a spy or a lawyer of course) and I really wanted to see how Hollywood sees it and what they make of it. But ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" is more than just a movie about salesmen, it's also a movie about deception, theft, anxiety, rage,... for every human feeling, except perhaps for love, there is place in this movie.Business isn't going well at John Williamson's real estate office. The sales numbers are too low and the salesmen aren't very motivated, because they believe they haven't received any good leads (the addresses of potential buyers). But than Blake comes in, one of the founders of the firm, and he has a proposition to make. He'll give an incentive to succeed in a sales contest that will last for only one week. The first price is a luxurious car and the ""golden"" Glengarry leads that he brought in with him, the second price a set of steak knives, the third or fourth price means that you'll get fired. Because there is no place for losers and because only the man who is able to close the most deals will get better leads, the competition and the tension raise to a boiling point. Immediately after Blake has left the office, propositions for deals and robbery arise, but all behind Ricky Roma's back, the very best salesman in the office. When the next morning the four employees show up at the firm, they find out that the Glengarry leads have been stolen. Williamson is desperate to find out who did it and now all salesmen face even more tension and difficulties...Even though this isn't always exactly the way how life as a salesman is (at least not where I work, but I admit that there are places where it does get very close to the situations in the movie), this movie gives an excellent idea of the stress and the tension that we have to go through from time to time. Especially at the end of the month when you haven't reached your target yet, life can be pretty hectic. And the incentive program is common practice as well, although I've never heard of a place where the third or the fourth would get fired.But those are just minor details, what is more important is the fact that this is a very suspenseful drama with some powerful acting. That's exactly what everybody expects with a cast like this one of course, but it isn't automatically true that when you have people like Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey and Alec Baldwin in your cast, that everything will work out perfectly. In this case it did, but that's also thanks to the story that has been well-written. David Mamet sure knows how to build up tension, how to give enough depth to the different characters and how to keep the viewer's attention.Even when you aren't in sales, I think this movie deserves a try. If it isn't for the fine story, than you should definitely give it a try for the top cast that gives away a very good performance. I give this movie a 7.5/10.",Glengarry Glen Ross
58,JLRMovieReviews,Those Big Ball Breakers,8,2 April 2009,"This is definitely a tour-de-force and a career high point for all involved. But, if you can't stand constant profanity, turn the station! Basically what you might call a man's movie by the sheer testosterone in it, the movie revolves around a real estate agency and how they try to go after the ""Big One."" Starring Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Alec Baldwin, and Kevin Spacey, this is one powerhouse film not to be missed.Having said that though, I don't think that I'd want to see this more than once, or twice at most. A great film, even if it is a drama, you could see over and over and it wouldn't get old, like Citizen Kane and the like. But I couldn't see myself seeing this over and over.If for no other reason than the movie's ending and how my favorite character has done something (for desperate reasons) for which there is no recourse but to be fired. His plot is just so sad and heart-wrenching that it's almost unbearable and painful to watch. You can imagine someone in real life being in his position. I was very sympathetic to his situation. Unfortunately, his bosses aren't.So, see this for the great stars. But, be prepared for the rug to come out from underneath you. It's far too realistic for comfort.",Glengarry Glen Ross
59,DeeNine-2,An intense emotional experience,9,2 November 2001,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)It doesn't take a movie connoisseur to see that this is a stage play filmed.So what? The play is a work of genius--it won a Pulitzer Prize--and the cast is about as good as you can get. Jack Lemmon gives a performance that will tear your heart out...well, if you're like any of the characters in the play, you have no heart! And Al Pacino gets to put the pedal to the metal and fire on all cylinders. He is great when he's screaming, and he's even better when he's handing out buddy-buddy BS philosophy. Kevin Spacey as John Williamson, the boss of the boiler room crew, has the skin of a rhino and the heart of a baboon. Incidentally, the language is foul, fouler and foulest, and indeed, poor David Mamet, who wrote the play and adapted it for the screen, ran out of expletives. I mean how many ways can you suggest that someone perform impossible acts upon themselves? Yet, considering the moral fiber of the characters, the language seemed not inappropriate.Indeed, Mamet is a master of dialogue and some of the set pieces are just marvels. The exchange between Dave Moss (Ed Harris) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin) as Moss leads up to his plan to steal the precious 'leads' is like a ping pong match done as a pas de deux. And the harangue by Alec Baldwin as the brass...endowed motivational speaker was a crack up.This is an extraordinarily intense film, so intense if you watch carefully you can see first Jack Lemmon and then Al Pacino so fired up and wildly expressive that spit comes out of their mouths along with the words. (I've done that.) In fact, all the actors feed off of one another. Being on the set must have been just an amazing experience with everyone trying to outdo everyone else. The timing alone is worth the ticket.Note that no women grace the screen. I mean zero. This is a war flick with con artists in the trenches. Note also how carefully plotted the story is. Mamet thought it out and worked and reworked it so that everything fits. For example when 'The Machine' Levene makes his little slip revealing that he knew that the Roma contract had not been sent, we can immediately fill in the details realizing that Dave Moss had gotten to him with his cowardly scheme. And when Levene learns that his miraculous $82,000 sale is to crazies who have no money and just like to talk to salesmen, we see how perfectly ironic that is, and how tragic, like the life of Willy Loman in Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman. We can also see, if we really want to look beyond the movie, that Jack Lemmon's interpretation of Levene owes something to Willy Loman as does Mamet's creation. I have seen Jack Lemmon in many things, beginning with Mr. Roberts (1955) through Some Like It Hot (1959) to Grumpy Old Men (1993) and he has been wonderful, one of the great stars of the silver screen, but I don't think I've ever seen him more convincing than here. All the other actors in this film also have done larger pieces and had more demanding roles, but I'll bet they seldom had more fun.You don't want to miss this movie. It is one of a kind. The cynicism is palpable and the desperation so humanly demeaning that it's almost funny.",Glengarry Glen Ross
60,sme_no_densetsu,Stellar performances abound in this under-appreciated gem,8,18 January 2009,"""Glengarry Glen Ross"" revolves around a group of underperforming real estate salesmen who are given notice that if they don't turn around their misfortunes post-haste they're out the door at the end of the month. Unfortunately, the leads that they have to work with make this task difficult, so they scheme to get their hands on the new 'Glengarry Glen Ross' leads that are 'for closers only'.The first thing that must be said about this film is that the cast is outstanding. Let's see, we've got Oscar winners Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Alan Arkin & Kevin Spacey and Oscar nominees Ed Harris & Alec Baldwin. Each of these individuals delivers a top-notch performance. I hate to single anyone out but it must be said that Lemmon's performance in particular is awe-inspiring. In the end, though, Pacino was the only cast member nominated for an Academy Award.David Mamet's script, based on his own Pulitzer Prize-winning play, is also top-notch. There is a certain cadence to his language, peppered with profanities as it is. Most importantly, it savours strongly of realism and draws us into the world of these high-pressure salesmen. I cannot fathom how it could have gone without an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.James Foley's direction is ably handled but it's nothing to get excited about. Since the film is based on a stage play there's not much of an opportunity to get creative anyways. The score by James Newton Howard is decent as well and sticks firmly in the background like the jazzy soundtrack choices.In my opinion, this film is an under-appreciated gem. The DVD seems to have been discontinued by the studio, which further illustrates the film's lack of respect. By all means, seek out this film and give it the attention that it deserves.",Glengarry Glen Ross
61,frankde-jong,The crook you are going to care about,8,25 April 2021,"""Glengarry Glen Ross"" is a film about a seedy real estate agency selling people worthless pieces of land and robbing them of their savings. The seedy character is symbolized in the film by the fact that the agency keeps office in a poor part of town and that it always rains.There are three important characters in the movie. Blake (the manager) played by Alec Baldwin, Ricky Roma (the young upcoming sales) played by Al Pacino and Shelley Levene (the old sales in the downward phase of his career) played by Jack Lemmon.Blake is a typical American and in my opinion rather uninteresting character. In his opinion the value of a human being can be measured by his wealth or the revenue he generates (My watch is more expensive then your car). His role in this film is to trigger the competition between te sales. Because business is not going well for the agency, the sales with the lowest weakly revenue will be fired.The film is about the competition between the sales, and especially about the underdog sales Shelley Levene. His character (played brilliantly by Jack Lemmon) is the only one we that we get to know personally. The strange thing is that we even begin to care for him, although in fact he is a crook. The reasons are in the first place that he is the underdog and in the second place that he has a sick daughter to care for. Losing his job is losing his health insurance. So we hope he is not losing his job, even if his job is stealing the savings from innocent people. I recently reviewed ""The insider"" (1999, Michael Mann) and also in this film the risk of losing health insurance that is badly needed played a role in generating sympathy for the lead character.There is another remarkable fact in this film. Although most of the spectators will see the sales as scammers, that is not the way they look at themselves. In one of the best scenes of the movie Ricky Roma and Shelley Levene are evaluating a sales conversation they recently had. From the way they talk about it is clear that they view their profession nearly as an art form.The story is situated in the 80's. In my opinion it is however of all times. Replace ""worthless peace of land"" with ""toxic financial derivative"" and you do have the financial crisis at the beginning of the new century.",Glengarry Glen Ross
62,seymourblack-1,"In Many Ways, One Of A Kind",9,14 March 2016,"Despite being character-driven, dialogue-heavy and very stagy, this movie adaptation of David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize winning play is immensely powerful, hard-hitting and intense. The stakes are high right from the start as a group of salesmen have to struggle against impossible odds (and each other) just to stay in their jobs. The ways in which the different characters respond to the pressure they're under provides a fascinating insight into human behaviour and their anger, frustration and resentment about the way they're being treated, triggers a whole series of highly-charged confrontations that generate a great deal of the energy that makes this remarkable drama so compelling.When a group of real estate salesmen working for a small company begin to under-perform, an executive called Blake (Alec Baldwin) is brought in to give a motivational speech. His technique involves launching into a furious rant during which he insults, patronises and humiliates the three men present and announces that a sales contest is to be held. The prize for the winner will be a Cadillac, the salesman who comes second will be rewarded with a set of steak knives and everyone else in the team will be fired. The men's common complaint about the useless leads they're being given by the company is discredited by Blake who constantly boasts about his own wealth and says that salesmen should ""always be closing"". Furthermore, he adds that he's brought with him a bundle of new leads which will only be given to the men who are able to close sales using the existing leads.The bad leads that the men have been working with, are people who they know either don't want to or can't afford to buy the properties they're selling plus a few time-wasters who just like talking to salesmen, but have no intention of buying.Typically, the three men respond in different ways to Blake's tirade. George Aaronow (Alan Arkin) who'd already become disillusioned by his inability to close any sales is totally crushed. The more hot-headed Dave Moss (Ed Harris) is fired-up to retaliate against the company with the same level of aggression and disrespect that Blake had delivered to him and so tries to involve Aaronow in a plan to steal the new leads and sell them on to a rival firm. By contrast, Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon) who's the company's most experienced salesman is prepared to do absolutely anything, however, disreputable, just to survive. The office manager John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) enforces Blake's instructions by keeping the new leads under lock and key but when the office is burgled and the leads are taken, Williamson calls in the police and everyone in the team, including top-performing salesman Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), who was absent from Blake's meeting, find themselves under suspicion.The most striking feature of this movie is its sizzling dialogue which is sharp, well-written and rapidly-delivered. It reflects perfectly the desperation and aggression of its characters who are mostly fast-talking individuals with an extensive vocabulary of profanities which they use frequently and forcefully during their numerous outbursts. All the characters are well-defined and come over as extremely authentic, not least, because they're all very recognisable types.With its all-star cast of top-class acting talent, ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" is full of powerful performances. Alec Baldwin makes a huge impression in his cameo role as Blake and Al Pacino is terrific as the company's current most successful salesman. He oozes charm, is thoroughly amoral and excels in his scenes with one of his clients (played by Jonathan Pryce) and his old mentor Shelley Levene.Levene, as played by Jack Lemmon, attempts to bribe Williamson in a variety of different ways to get his hands on the good leads and uses some elaborate deceptions in his dealings with his potential clients. In an outstanding performance, Lemmon actually makes this unpleasant man sympathetic, partly because of a distressing problem that he has in his personal life and also because of the constant optimism he displays, even though he knows that he's over-the-hill and his most successful years are behind him.""Glengarry Glen Ross"" is unquestionably an extraordinary movie and in many ways, one of a kind.",Glengarry Glen Ross

64,telegonus,A Superlatively Acted Mediocre Piece Of Work,7,30 June 2002,"This is a well-directed adaptation of David Mamet's trenchant play about corrupt real estate salesman, and one's enjoyment of it will depend on whether one cares for Mamet's tricksy, obscenity-laden dialogue, and if one is a fan of first-rate acting. I'm less than enthusiastic about Mamet's work, which strikes me as gimmicky and repetitive. He seems to be always working out some private issues that he inevitably hangs on sexual or economic politics; and there is a lack of depth and originality in his work, and a penchant for envelope-pushing that I do not personally care for. On the other hand, Mamet actors seem to rate him highly, and tend to give their all when appearing in his work. Glengarry Glen Ross is exceedingly well acted by all,--Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Alec Baldwin and, in a small but pivotal role, Jonathan Pryce. The edge of desperation around the eyes, and the crack in his Ivy league voice, makes Jack Lemmon's character of Shelley a pathetic, well-rounded figure. Harris and Arkin breathe life into their one-dimensional characters, and seem continually to be shouting throughout the film. Pacino's performance is the most flamboyant and also the most disciplined of the group, making the loathsome Ricky Roma both charismatic and repulsive. He at times sounds like he's literally singing his lines, and he moves more gracefully than I've ever seen him. The play is at times ludicrous, and the resolution (who stole the leads?) is strictly from the Golden Age of television. I can't imagine that people in real life could carry on like the characters in this play do for more than an hour or so, as most normal people would, were they to conduct themselves at such a fever pitch, go into cardiac arrest or suffer a stroke. Overall this is a first-rate adaptation of an essentially second-rate piece of work, with hollering and swearing making up for imagination and true insight into characters.",Glengarry Glen Ross
65,sharky_55,Always Be Closing,8,17 November 2015,"Glengarry Glen Ross is an film adaptation of David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize winning stage play and it shows with its performance based drama and loose plot. At times I did wonder how much could the screen medium really add to the story? How do you shoot something that would be show to an audience entirely from one angle without making it boring but also not distill the narrative? It's odd. There are a few cinematic moments which stand out. One is as Levene steps outside the dreary grey office and into the night while Moss and Aaronow converse in the car, and here it almost veer into neo-noir territory, as he steps inside a payphone booth where the strong contrast of neon red on blue lighting, the lazy jazz backing and the rain make these salesmen's lives decidedly more bleak and morally ambiguous. Another is as Levene makes yet another sales call, and he murmurs an instruction to a off- screen secretary/assistant in what would be a busy office, but as the camera arcs around there is not a person in sight. Claustrophobia is also supposed to be key here, although to be honest I didn't notice that element. Anyways, it is always interesting to see how one medium can complement another.Many have already talked of the infamous monologue ""Coffee is for closers"" from Alec Baldwin. It is tremendously compelling, so much so that it becomes the mantra for real life sales industries. What is interesting is a slight drawback to this (and as he does not exist in the original play, this creates a new problem) - which is the effect of the speech in manifesting a sort of shared animosity for the dilemma in the four salesmen. This is in itself ironic because it is the complete opposite of what Baldwin preaches. And so Moss and Aaronow strike up a plan to commit theft against the company that would so easily fire them, and they both walk out of the interrogating office furious and completely in denial about the accusations leveled at them, but at the time, we do not know that only one of these reactions is genuine (which severely lessens its effect once we find out Aaronow is innocent, I think). But he has collaborated with another in the office.Another thing the Baldwin speech indicates is the lack of the star closer, Roma, whom does not even bother attending while he rests at the top of the leaderboard. He is already living out its ideals in his work, but by contrast he is not ruthless and without care, but almost seductive in the way he charms a potential buyer. He rambles on and on about philosophical and moral and abstract ideals, and after countless drinks and tender glances only then does he slip an offer to buy, no, an opportunity. Pacino conjures a master illusion from a dusty suit and slides his way into his heart. When Pryce arrives the next morning, meekly trying to reverse the purchase, he is again at work, and see how Pacino squirm and weasels his way once again, beneath a veneer of sleaziness (his strong reaction to winning a Cadillac is evident of this). And what does Pryce's character do upon discovering the manipulation? He doesn't erupt in anger and profanity, but begs forgiveness, as if he is the one who has let Roma down. And in this moment we know exactly why he is number one on the chalkboard. But the star must be Lemmon's Levene. His performance is remarkable; observe how effortlessly he switches into sales mode, how easily he pretends as if he was some important, high ranking sales associates with an abundance of wealth and inquiries and meetings to get to (Levene must evidently fantasise about such a career, such is the way he can instantly conjure them). When he pays a house visit to a potential (although they both know such a sale will not happen), he is sincere and honest and attempts to disarm the man with goodwill and familiarity, but beneath this persona we see a person who is cracking. He has been presented with a Catch 22, and cannot rise from the bottom, and feels disillusioned that such a veteran of his industry could be treated this way. He reacts with anger and profanity as they all do, but not before attempting to bribe and plead and threaten his way out of the situation to the office manager Williamson. This is so effective because we have prior witnessed his charm, and now he must beg, teary eyed, only to be shut down harshly. In Scorsese's Wolf of Wall Street, the stockbrokers are straight up crooks, and there is no time wasted in establishing this, as booze and women and wild parties are hurled from the screen. Here, there is a semblance of authenticity because it is necessary to contrast the two to show just how miserable these men and their lives are. The leads are weak? F*cking leads are weak. You're weak. And so they lash out with tirades laden with profanity, and each victory is gloated unbearably, and each loss is treated as a tragedy. Who is the lowest on the chalkboard? It could be any of the four. They are each so desperate. And for what, 10%? Mitch and Murray, unseen, are the real winners here.",Glengarry Glen Ross
66,jhclues,Mamet Sells It,9,13 January 2002,"Those who must rely on their wits to make a living are often prone to desperate measures born of the insecurities inherent in their field of endeavor-- a straight commission salesman, for example; or in this instance, a real estate salesman, in particular.  And under pressure, to what will one in such a position resort to stay afloat when times are tough?  A legitimate question that every consumer would no doubt like to have answered before signing the dotted line and committing some big money to a purchase.  Well, hold tight, because help is on the way, as writer/director David Mamet goes to great lengths to answer it in `Glengarry Glen Ross,' an unflinching, hard-edged film that examines the motivations of those who would readily and eagerly separate you from more than a few of your hard earned dollars, and whose least concern, apparently, is the value of their product or that parcel of land, which according to them is situated just this side of Shangri-la.  And if you've ever trusted a big-ticket salesman in your life, after visiting Mamet's film, it's doubtful you ever will again.	Very simply, the story is this:  The Company wants results; the hierarchy expects their salesmen to produce, and they don't care how.  Toward that end, a `motivator' (Alec Baldwin), has been dispatched to this particular office to put things into perspective for those who would sell their wares, as it were.  The deal is, that at the end of a given period of time, the salesman whose name is at the top of the tote board will get a new car; those who fail to meet their quota are out the door.  End of story.  They will, however, be supplied with `leads,' but from the `old' file.  The new, `fresh' leads are reserved for those who first prove themselves worthy, those who can do whatever it takes to make the sale, without qualm, reservation or conscience.  But the prospect of being put on the street in the wake of the give-no-quarter edict only serves to drive one amongst them to an act of desperation-- an irrational act from which there can be no forgiveness and no redemption.  A tough verdict, but then again, nobody said life was going to be easy.	In adapting his own play for the screen, Mamet returns to one of his favorite themes by exploring yet another variation of the `con' forever being perpetrated somewhere, on someone, in one way or another.  In Mamet's world (in films such as `House of Games' and the more recent `Heist') nothing is ever as it seems, and the confidence game is always afoot, the causes and effects of which make up the drama of his stories.  And this film is no exception.  Whether it's the smooth and savvy top-dog of the office, Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), schmoozing a client into handing over a check, or a veteran loser like Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon) showing up at someone's door on a cold call at a most inopportune and inconvenient moment and refusing to leave, Mamet convincingly maintains that the con-is-always-on, and the result-- especially in this film-- is a bleak, but riveting commentary on the human condition, delivered with an intensity that will keep you on the very edge of your emotional seat right up to the end.	The cast Mamet assembled for this offering is superb:  Al Pacino is in top form and extremely effective with a comparatively tempered performance; the scene in which he lulls his customer (played by Jonathan Pryce) into complacency is absolutely hypnotic.  This is the salesman you hope you never encounter, especially if something like the Brooklyn Bridge is being offered, as such overtures as those proffered by Ricky Roma are just too hard to refuse.  And Pacino not only sells it, he closes the deal, as well.	Ed Harris, as Dave Moss, is outstanding, also, creating a character whose bitterness seems to flow from the inside out, and has long since overwhelmed that ability and better part of himself that could've made him a successful salesman, had he but turned his energies to more positive concerns and away from the self-defeating, self-pity into which he has descended.  While at the opposite end of the spectrum is George, played by Alan Arkin, who unlike Dave (who though unable to act upon it, at least had promise at some point in his career) has nothing but insecurity and empty dreams to sustain him. As wonderfully realized by Arkin, he's the proverbial duck-out-of-water, who belongs anywhere except in a job as a salesman.	The best performance of all, however, is turned in by Jack Lemmon, who in Shelley Levene creates a character so steeped in despair and hopelessness that's it's almost tangible.  You have but to look into Lemmon's eyes to understand the turmoil and depth of Shelley's desperation, and Lemmon successfully conveys the complexities of this man in terms that are believable and incredibly real.  He makes Shelley a guy you can feel for without necessarily sympathizing with him.  It's simply a terrific piece of work by a terrific actor.	Another of the film's strengths is the performance by Kevin Spacey, as John Williamson, the office manager.  It's an understated, but pivotal role, and Spacey does a good job of making it convincing, which ultimately heightens the overall impact of the film, especially the climax.
	The supporting cast includes Bruce Altman (Mr. Spannel), Jude Ciccoledda (Detective) and Paul Butler (Policeman).  Mamet builds and sustains a tension throughout this film that drives the anxiety level through the roof; at times, it's exhausting to watch.  In the end, however, `Glengarry Glen Ross' is a satisfying experience, involving very real situations with which many in the audience will be able to relate, and delivered with a high-powered energy equal to the subject matter.  And once you catch your breath, it's one you're going to appreciate even more.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",Glengarry Glen Ross
67,johno-21,Why all the drama?,6,9 March 2006,"This had been out for a couple years before I got around to seeing it and it was recommended to me by several friends. David Mamet takes his Pulitzer Prize winning Broadway play with his own screen adaptation to the big screen with an additional character pivotal to the movie written into the cast. Great acting from a terrific ensemble cast featuring Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin and Jonathan Pryce. Pacino was nominated as Best Supporting Actor from the group for the 1992 Academy Award. Any of the others it could be argued would have been worthy of a nomination themselves. Mamet had been successful with his screenplay of the remake of The Postman Always Rings Twice and his original story for The Untouchables on the big screen before Glengary as well as some lesser films. He would have limited continued success with such films later on like Hoffa, Wag the Dog and Hannibal. James Foley had never had a successful film as a Director before this and never has had since. It's a great character study but after studying them you find you don't care for any of the characters. Lemmon gives a sentimental performance but what is his character doing in this venomous boiler room real estate office specializing in selling worthless real estate in the first place? This may have been quick and snappy and explosive on the stage but on the big screen it's confined and claustrophobic. It's intense but there is no life and death plot to warrant it's intensity. The Lemmon character might be to old and desperate to keep his job but maybe it's time to collect social security and be a greeter a Wall Mart. For the rest of the characters move on and get a decent job somewhere else. Why all the drama? I would give this a 6.5 out of 10.",Glengarry Glen Ross
68,tim-764-291856,Actors Begin Cursing...,8,13 October 2012,"My strange title spells out the A B C of selling - Always Be Closing but also hints at how ugly this film's dialogue often is.But David Mamet's screenplay, from his Pulitzer prize-winning play is about a man's world and is set in one, where men of varying personalities and abilities speak freely as men do, often in passion, often in anger and often with both.Whilst cinematically restrictive, director James Foley's rather claustrophobic 4:3 ratio swings along with the crisp, tart dialogue and soon one is entranced by the super-actor ensemble cast of Ed Harris, Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Alan Arkin, Jonathan Pryce and Alec Baldwin. Even Jack Lemmon pulls in one of his best ever performances in a sort of Death of a Salesman type of character who knows he's lost his magic touch and hates it even more when reminded of this.Which he is, often by the intentionally obnoxious, condescending comparative youngster Baldwin, as he pounds out the brutality of selling real estate in Chicago. Each man has his own turn to pour out his grievances, bitterness and above all, rivalry, yet they all have a common aim, not to get fired - and to get the figures that the Baldwin whizz-kid wants and where the difference between salesman of the month is a new Cadillac and second is, well, steak knives.The actual story pretty well takes second billing as the dialogue and the men's scorn, wrath and lives are put on the line, exposed like dirty washing put out to dry. One could easily give a higher score than I have done and maybe I should have, but I'm plumping for 8/10, as as I said, quite a lot of the dialogue is fairly grating and is often downright nasty, so it's not the easiest or most enjoyable film I've ever seen. Taken as an actor's piece (Pacino was Oscar nominated) and a study of modern day male rivalry, then it is excellent.",Glengarry Glen Ross

I rented it on a whim and I've watched it four times since Monday.Glengarry Glen Ross is the story of a failing real estate office in which four agents are told they'd better get some property sold quick, or they'll be out of a job. By the end of the month, the top seller will win himself a Cadillac, the guy who finishes second will win himself a set of steak knives. The other two jokers will be out on the street. The problem is that the good leads are locked away in a filing cabinet in the office manager's room. They won't be distributed until the end of the contest. The guys are left with only leads that likely won't pan out at all.The four salesmen are each very memorable individuals. Al Pacino plays the best of the bunch. He's smooth and confident, and he seems to be the only guy making any good sales recently. Jack Lemmon is the old lion of the bunch. He's a good talker, but he's been on a stretch of terrible luck both professionally and personally. It's looking like he is now obsolete, and could be one of the guys let go. Ed Harris is a brooding; scheming character also on a streak of bad luck. His plan is not to make sales, but break into the office and steal the good leads. Alan Arkin is a meek fellow who cannot even dial the right phone number or carry on any type of meaningful conversation. Each actor has their character down perfectly.The story unfolds in less than a 24 hour period. Alec Baldwin is a hotshot salesman from ""downtown"" who shows up at the beginning of the film and lets the guys know how worthless they are. He lays down the terms of the contest in some very colorfully profane language that sets the tone for the rest of the script. Profanity can be monotonous and gratuitous, but not here. Mamet's script is like a piece of art formed by interlacing all the fine swear words in the English language together with a touch of ironic gloom. And how often do you hear the word ""c*cksucker"" said with the articulate dignity of Jack Lemmon? We see each character for what they are, and each actor is allowed to show us why they are so famous. I believe this film to be a landmark piece of cinema for this generation. As much as 12 Angry Men was in its own time. How often do you see such a cast get together with such a fine script? Not often enough, I'd say.The Kevin Spacey character has a special place in my heart. I also work at a job where I have to deal with a bunch of pompous salesmen. I suppose it comes with the job, but salesmen always seem to think they are more important than they are. What they don't seem to understand is that different people can be hired to sell the same goods and services. More often than not, it is the company that retains or loses customers. That said, sales is a ballsy profession, and it does take genuine skill and luck to be successful at it.For those out there who either are salesmen or like them, then this film will also be a treat. There is one beautiful scene in particular when Jack Lemmon has just made what he thinks is a huge sale to break his slump. He bursts into the office and happily demands his sale be noted on the board with everyone else's. Nobody but Pacino seems interested (Harris for example acts jealous and spiteful) in hearing the details. Pacino comes over and sits by Lemmon and listens to how the old master was able to pull it off. The camera subtly backs off and lets the two share the moment together. That was very well-done.Due to all the profanity in this film, it is basically not possible to show it on network television. This may be the primary reason the film has slipped through the cracks over the years, and not made many top 100 lists and so forth. If you want to see some great actors doing what they do best, then DO NOT MISS THIS FILM! 10 of 10 stars the Hound.",Glengarry Glen Ross
70,petra_ste,"Third prize is, you're fired",8,24 April 2020,"One of the main themes of the works by David Mamet is the tension between human relationships and professional goals. In Speed the Plow, a movie producer is torn between greenlighting the artsy project sponsored by the young woman he likes and a more conventional script likely to become a hit. In American Buffalo, petty criminal ""Teach"" gaslights his fellow thieves at the prospect of a promising robbery.Seldom, however, the depiction of a toxic business environment smothering human relationships has been as effective as in Glengarry Glen Ross, a gripping drama/character study about a group of real estate salesmen followed the day before and after their office is robbed.Nearly every relationship in the film is some shade of awful. Desperate Levene (Jack Lemmon), former ace salesman on a bad streak, tries to appeal to supericilious middle-manager Williamson (Kevin Spacey), but all his pleas fall completely flat. Levene isn't bringing results so he is worth nothing to Williamson.The flipside is the relationship between Williamson and hotshot salesman Roma (Al Pacino). Roma despises his young, inexperienced boss and loses no opportunity to verbally tear him to shreds.See also Roma's persuasion of client Lingk (Jonathan Pryce), a man with crippling self-esteem issues who falls for Roma pretending to be his friend; or bitter Moss (Ed Harris), apparently supporting spineless Aaronow (Alan Arkin) only to attempt to drag him into a scheme.The only non-poisonous relationship, based on mutual respect, seems to be the one between Roma and Levene; the movie suggests they are symbolically the same person in a different stage of life, with Roma being Levene's brilliant past while Levene is Roma's bleak future. In fact, when Levene temporarily gains the upper-hand on Williamson, he adopts Roma-like mockery and scorn.The most vicious scene, however, is the brutal motivational speech delivered by powerful Blake (Alex Baldwin) to the increasingly humiliated salesmen. Mamet's staccato, profanity-heavy dialogue has never been sharper, his portrayal of how professional goals can destroy human relationships never bleaker. Acting is masterful throughout.8/10.",Glengarry Glen Ross
71,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Conveying emotion,9,9 November 2007,"There is a great scene in this movie. Actually there are many great scenes, but I choose to mention this one since it sets up the main course of action. The scene is relatively simple: three worn out salesmen are told that they're fired and have one week to regain their respective positions, or they're fired for good. Simple, yes, but it is delivered with a scorching fierceness that makes Alec Baldwin's roughly six minute performance resonate throughout the entire film. But in doing so, it doesn't overshadow or diminish the rest of the performances which are great even by themselves. So in putting all these performances together into one film you truly have something that is greater than just the sum of its already good parts.The film seemingly draws from Arthur Miller's ""Death of a Salesman,"" but it shows what Miller's play chose not too: professional struggle. Meaning not at home, but at work. Not with wives and sons, but with co-workers and bosses. Basically the other side of the spectrum and it is no less interesting to see especially when it is delivered so well. Throughout the film the camera is relatively static, the characters in only a few different places all wearing the same plain clothes. But the subtleties and little gestures of each character flesh them out as to almost be palpable to someone watching. The use of profanity is also very good. Many film's use profane dialog as punchlines or simply since it is like violence in action films: it sells. What ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" offers is not characters who talk, but character who convey emotion, and that is the essence of human speech - both in real life and in the movies.Scripter David Mamet also co-wrote (albeit under an alias) the screenplay for the action film ""Ronin"" from 1998. On the surface it's an action movie with great car chases, but the dialog there is reflective of Mamet's style that he demonstrates here. Not surprisingly ""Ronin"" is one of the best rated action film's here on IMDb and that, at least by now, shouldn't come to anyone as a surprise. --- 9/10Rated R for profanity.

73,Pedro_H,A small set of targets - but splits the bullseye every time.,8,18 November 2004,"A set of tricky-dicky land salesman are put under extra pressure to sell-sell-sell. To encourage them further a set of prizes are put on offer by the ""down town"" office. They are - in descending order - a car, a set of steak knives, being fired!Transferring plays to the screen has long been a staple of Hollywood. Stating the very obvious, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. However when they don't work critics will often say ""they didn't do enough to open it up.""Well here they haven't sought to open up an obvious play and thank god they haven't because this is a mini-masterpiece and it could have been ruined. The sets may be limited, but there isn't a single scene that rings false or has no part in forwarding the story.What makes this extra special that there are no parts played by anything other than major acting talent: Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin and Jonathon Price all together in one place at one time. (I am not being sexist - there really are no speaking parts for women!)Lemmon gives his swansong performance as an ageing salesman (Shelley ""The Machine"" Levene) that is going through a period of either ""bad luck"" or ""bad leads."" Thank heavens the bad language didn't cause he to turn down the role of a lifetime.We linger to see his crooked sales technique. Firstly he isn't selling anything, merely a man out to do another human being a favour out of the goodness of his heart! To the client he is not even a real salesman, but a fictional President (or other high-up) that just so happens to be passing through town and wants to drop by to discuss an ""exciting opportunity.""He is so hardened to the door-slam that he hardly notices it anymore - merely moving on to the next mark with the same zest and enthusiasm. The sight of a client signing the dotted line is his orgasm. Like real sexual conquest it is relished and described in blow-by-blow detail to whoever will listen.Al Pacino could have been a salesman or a con man (here the line is blurred) in real life. Although he has a script to work with he really does have that kind of brain and the ability to drag people in via attitude, voice and charisma: You have to be a raconteur, get people's attention, lure them, soften them up. Then without the client knowing a thing about it, in comes the ""soft sell"" sales pitch!Here a ""closed"" deal goes wrong and he goes from sleep mode to a 100 miles an hour in seconds: Playing for time, being confused by the obvious, trying to make for the door, trying the sales patter one more time, he tries every crooked trick in the book to keep his percentage. But he's a loser, because there are people that know a scam when they see one - if not the client themselves.(There may be ""one born every minute"", but they often marry the less gullible.)Kevin Spacey wasn't a star when this came out and paradoxically probably wouldn't have been cast had he been one. His character - while key - is background.He is the bookkeeper and the clerk and doesn't have to knock on doors and sell things on cold raining nights. He is free from the highs and lows of sales - a family man that puts up with the flack like the punch bag he undoubtedly is. But don't write him off too early - he has some of the best and most telling lines in the whole piece.What we have here is acting. Pure and simple. Nothing to hide behind bar a hat, a raincoat or a shinny suit. Writer Mamet has obviously been there and done it for real. Although some of the swearing and going from calm to frantic (and back again) is a bit over-the-top.The subject itself is an unexplored part of Western culture. People that are professional liars. People that say the truth only when it suits their cause - which means rarely. To win-at-all-cost means to sell-at-all-cost. Stop at nothing and let nothing stop you.There is a plot - of sorts - about golden sales leads that are being stored in the office. Through this we have the needed drama, revelation and downfall. In the end we see the professional gambler (I won't say which character) who has seen his last horse lose and has no more money left in his pocket and no more hope in his heart. The saddest sight in the whole world...",Glengarry Glen Ross
74,redkiwi,Great movie!,8,22 April 2000,"Glengarry Glen Ross is a very enjoyable tale of the struggles of a group of Real Estate Salesmen - enjoyable as it's well directed, has an excellent script and a brilliant cast.Kevin Spacey is his usual excellent self, Baldwin does a good job of his role - but the star is undoubtedly Jack Lemmon, who is excellent as the washed up salesman Shelley Levene.Excellent performances from Jonathan Pryce and Ed Harris make this a must see.",Glengarry Glen Ross
75,Bogmeister,Don't Spit at Me While You're Shouting!,9,19 February 2006,"I remember when this was previewing (as trailers) in theaters in the early nineties before it came out; most of the audience couldn't figure out what it was about, so it was poorly marketed. It's ironic that it's about selling - the selling of a concept, a dream, that glorious piece of American property we all think about at one time or another. Since then, the film, like ""Shawshank Redemption,"" has grown in reputation, and rightly so. Perhaps the greatest all-male ensemble cast was put together to flesh out seven unique, intriguing characters who all let loose their rage and despair on camera (I used to think the best male cast was ""The Great Escape"" from '63, but I now confine that opinion to the sixties decade). Most of the characters make their living in a real estate office, but it's like no such office I've ever been in. Though it's never spelled out, I think this is where all those horror stories about purchasing useless swamp land come from. The characters must make their living via this 'hard sell' process - they're probably selling stuff which they know is no good and they've developed intricate con(niving) stories to pretty up the items, but they're probably also filled with self-loathing and a general displeasure with the world for being in the position they're in. But this is conjecture, amateur psycho-analysis developed for those truly superior film stories (from David Mamet's play) where the viewer finds himself 2nd-guessing the complicated characters. On the surface, a couple of the characters (played by Lemmon & Pacino) seem to actually enjoy being at the top of their game, old school professionals with much pride in their work and who make this selling to unsuspecting 'victims' a new kind of art form.Much, if not all, of this information comes from the lengthy dialogue by Mamet. In this film, the dialogue is all-important not only for imparting factual information but in the nuances and style presented by each performer. Unlike most other feature films, where actors enjoy acting 'on an impulse' for many of the scenes, disregarding much of the written word, here they had to stay exact to the script. Each of their lines and, therefore, each of their speeches needed to remain within this strict framework yet, at the same time, the actors had to convey a reality to the story - to not make it look like simple acting out of a screenplay or reading a bunch of lines. They really had their work cut out for them and, man, does it show in the finished product, because they made it work. This is why one may have heard elsewhere how Baldwin's 7 minutes of screen time are the best of his career (I once played his scene to the office staff I worked with in the mid-nineties and they were just spellbound during the entire thing; afterwards, they looked shellshocked). It's also inspiring that each of the ensemble, each creating a distinctive and memorable character, succeed for themselves on every level - there are no weak parts.If I had to pick one as a favorite, I suppose mine would be Lemmon's 'the machine' Levene, the older veteran of the bunch. Lemmon threw out most of his well-known mannerisms & tricks and, at the same time, drew on his many years of thespian experience. He catches lightning in a bottle here as an older man at the end of his rope, with problems a viewer can really sympathize with, but also swaggering with offensive personality traits that make you realize he's his own worst enemy. One minute you feel that sinking despair he seems surrounded by, like a drowning rat (in the rain, in a phone booth); the next you want to slap him for being such a boorish loudmouth. He ends up with the best arc of the story and it's brutal by the end. Pacino is excellent as usual as the smoothest operator; we're used to hearing Pacino yell by now, but here it really does make you wince when he let's loose. And speaking of yelling, Harris just explodes in his final scene, almost literally. The rage building within him throughout the film is released in a torrent, drenching the walls - it's an unnerving display of male anger rarely, if ever, captured in the movies. Interesting to note that Spacey, one of Hollywood's most celebrated actors nowadays, comes off as 4th or 5th best in this, but his is the least flamboyant character. And I probably related more to his office manager than any of the others.",Glengarry Glen Ross
76,moviesleuth2,Mamet fans only,5,4 February 2008,"Film freaks, like myself, have their favorite actor, director, writer, etc. A few filmmakers have an instantly recognizable style that has defined them. David Mamet is one of them. Even to someone who has never seen a Mamet movie or play, it will most definitely be clear that there's something about the dialogue in this movie that separates it from everything else.While I certainly won't say that Mamet is a bad writer (in fact, he has a tremendous gift with the written word), I can't say that I am a fan. Particularly in this movie, he's very wordy, and that can make the story hard to follow. While the dialogue is crisp and poetic, the strands of dialogue are so long and colorful that it can make the plot hard to follow. I guess that many will find that okay since plot is really inconsequential in a movie like this.It's basically about a group of salesman who are trying to sell the most real estate to save their jobs. The bottom two salesmen by the end of the week will be fired. Immediately after the men find out about their predicament, the new leads, which are key to making a sale, have been stolen. Here it turns into a mixture of subtle whodunit and ""Death of a Salesman."" It's got to be amazing to see such a high profile cast in one movie where they all get to create new and original characters without having to resort to 90% of the roles being cameos (Alec Baldwin being an exception). While the acting is terrific (Jack Lemmon and Alan Arkin are especially good), it's not what it aspires to be. Still, I'm not going to stop someone from checking it out if they want to.",Glengarry Glen Ross

The story is simple. And there are a few twists, not great. Without the acting, there wouldn't be much of a movie. It's fairly low key, all dialogue. Rating is an 8, B+, 10 given for balance.

78,policy134,All-star spectacle and then some.,10,15 August 2005,"There was never a more excellent cast than this and to give all of these superb actors a chance to shine in individual scenes is quite a feat. Alec Baldwin starts out with a bravura speech that is the best he has ever done to this date, one that was specifically written for the movie by the way.Then there is Jack Lemmon who should have been nominated for an Academy Award because his nervous energy is visible in every scene he's in and check out his final scene where he finds out that he's been had. He just nails that moment. After being totally ecstatic for 10 minutes he becomes a complete blank. His character also has the best motivation to sell - he wants his wife to be proud of him and his downfall is therefore all the more poignant.Kevin Spacey, pre Oscar, is terrific. He is the pencil pusher that nobody likes but still remains somehow dignified and doesn't lose his cool at all. It is fun to see him take abuse without even flinching.There is a lot more to say about this excellent film but to those who are unfamiliar with the playwright, David Mamet, you can bet on hearing some of the most colorful dialog ever written and it is amazing that with a movie that is basically all talk and very little action, it is a most riveting experience. Just check out the later Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito movie with the same basic theme and compare. That doesn't even come close to a 5 on my list of best but this is the triumphant filmed play and there are not many.",Glengarry Glen Ross
79,thejcowboy22,That Was Easy Wasn't It?,7,17 October 2017,"One of the greatest cons of all time is the sale. Convincing someone to buy a product, even if they are just looking or vaguely interested. The art of the sale. I admire my Son cause he has the gift of selling. Starting out as a young car salesman in Rhode Island My son learned his trade by studying body gestures and facial expressions. Went to seminars just to learn how to win over someone's confidence implementing empathy with the customer, staying focused on your goals with a certain responsibility supplementing persistence and optimism despite the numerous rejections. Many intricate parts to the art of the sale but what it takes to sell real estate? ""BRASS BALLS"". Glengarry Glen Ross is such a picture as it takes a look at the underbelly world of sales, Following the lives of four real estate salesmen. Unscrupulous, cunning and crafty but reaching a dead end with empty leads dispensed by the office manager Williamson (Kevin Spacey). The story draws the initial attention to a slumping,over the hill salesman Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon) who is on the phone discussing a medical issue about his ailing daughter. Shelley's daughter's illness never goes any further in detail but Shelly needs to close an account for her medical care. Now, in his early Sixties, Shelley Levene was once a dominant force in the real estate game. Shelly, has fallen on hard times and Williamson lets him know it. A meeting is held in the home office as a brash well dressed man enters the Room as he see Shelly pouring coffee and orders him to put the coffee down. ""Coffee is for closer!"" exhorts the tall stranger who's name is Blake (Alec Baldwin). This scene is worth watching as the revolting Blake tells the dyer realities of not closing a customer with the consequences of losing their jobs. Blake continues his sermon to these frustrated salesmen telling them either they sell these properties and use the leads you already have.Alec Baldwin gives a speech that reminds me of the movie Patton starring George C, Scott with strength and conviction yet arrogant to his audience as Dave Moss (Ed Harris) questions why he wastes his time preaching how great salesman he is to us losers. Blake's brash reply, ""Cause Mitch and Murray,(The owners) asks me to."" In Blake's hands are the New Leads but he indicates you don't get them. Shelley insists the existing leads are a dead end. Blake drives into high gear as he tells them their wimps and that he could close them himself and make $15,000 dollars tonight on those leads. Meanwhile Rick Roma (Al Pacino) is in a local restaurant/bar trying to sell properties to an unsure, indecisive buyer James Lingk (Jonathan Pryce). Roma does a fine job playing on Lingk's insecurities. Making the sale sound like more of an opportunity than a purchase and done quite eloquently. Shelley desperate due to his daughter's health tries to meet with Williamson to get the new leads Bribing Williamson with money he doesn't have. Williamson tells Shelly forget it; no chance as he leaves Shelley in the rain. In an another car Moss meets with another salesman George Aaronow (Alan Arkin) who seems a bit inexperienced at this sales job as Moss has a plan to have George break in the office and steel the new leads and sells them to a competitor. George wants no part of that scheme. We follow Shelley to one of his potential sales but the persons isn't interested in buying. I felt that scene was important to show the frustration and hopeless downward spiral salesmanship can become. The authenticity of the scene shows a last ditch effort for a sale vanquish in failure. Poor over-the- hill Shelley wearing his Fishing hat and raincoat gives you empathy in the Shelley character as the next morning's events will show. Desperation can drive a man to do anything. Alan Arkin's Character shows a believable lack of confidence and tremendous helpings of paranoia. Pacino and Lemmon work well together in the office scenes as authorities close in on the suspect. Spoiler Alert!!! but worth seeing The climactic ending. Lemmon is verbally pounding Spacey against the ropes and this leads to a dramatic turnabout as the Levene character incriminates himself and Spacey has the upper hand. Shelley breaks down in shame would make Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman look minor by comparison. I felt that Spacey had the best lines in the movie among this all-star cast. This reminds me of the Ray Charles song entitled ""BUSTED"" as one of the lines was ,""I am no thief but a man could go wrong when he's busted. Shelley's desperation lead him down the wrong path as his best years are behind him in many ways .

The next morning they find that the leads are stolen and they must find out who did it.First off, the acting in this film is perfect.  Baldwin may only be in the film for ten minutes, but he steals the show (and your attention) for every frame that he is on screen.  Lemmon's ""Shelley Levene"" is sadly pathetic, you really feel sorry for him.

87,alainenglish,Searing sales drama,9,1 April 2007,"""Glengarry Glen Ross"" is brilliant in the way it uses sales as a metaphor for life and the human condition. The only other work to do this at this standard is Arthur Miller's play ""Death of a Salesman"". Other films that have done this, ""Wall Street"" and the more recent ""Boiler Room"" are good but not as good as this.Remarkable character work by every actor involved here portrays the heartbreaking and merciless atmosphere these people are caught up in. Of the four real estate salesmen we meet in this movie, only one of them, Roma (Al Pacino), makes any money at it. Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon) was once a great salesman now on an irreversible decline and is on the point of collapse. The other two Aaronow (Alan Arkin) and Moss (Ed Harris), shuffle on hopelessly but Moss is thinking of pulling out and screwing over the office while he's at it. They are lorded over by the office administrator Williamson (Kevin Spacey), who looks down on them all even though he's never actually been a salesman himself. But things heat up for them all when a pitiless corporate hotshot Blake (Alec Baldwin) is brought in to tell the losers among them to close deals or they will be fired...Fantastic from the get-go, nearly every moment of this drama shines. Three scenes stand out: Roma's scene in the restaurant early on where he seduces someone he randomly meets (Jonathan Pryce) and through careful schmoozing turns that encounter into a sale. In parallel to this is a scene taking place across the road in the sales office, where Roma's hapless colleagues are getting their ears burned by Blake. Then there is the final scene where Levene sees all his hopes destroyed by Williamson, after the latter discovers that he's behind a robbery at the office.Bizarrely ignored and under-hyped at the time of it's release, only now is ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" receiving the kind of adulation it deserves.A winner.",Glengarry Glen Ross

He's had a few misses as a director, but I can't see any way to deny that Mamet is one of the best writers to ever exist. With Glengarry Glen Ross he took on the bold task of adapting his own play for the screen and many have said that he actually managed to improve on the original format. Whether or not that's true, what is true is that the film is miraculous.Mamet studies several men as they traverse the hardships of working at a real estate office, told through one night and early morning when the pressure is on for them to close their worn out leads. The dialogue is Mamet at his finest; a cynical portrayal of blue-collar working that can get anyone who's ever worked a day in their life to relate. The frustrations, the bitter resentment towards peers and superiors, it's all feelings that anyone has felt and he pours it into this compelling journey of interesting and diverse characters.Looking at the roster of actors here it's kind of baffling that only one of them managed to get award nominations for their work in this, because every single member of the cast delivers fireworks; it's honestly one of the greatest ensembles ever put on film. Whether it's Jack Lemmon's heartbreaking desperation, Al Pacino's fury and swagger, Ed Harris' violent rage against the world or Kevin Spacey's smarmy superiority, everyone in the cast shines through each scene they have. This is a lesson on how to act in one hundred minutes; I could go on for days about the skill that these actors possess throughout this film, not a single one of them missing a beat. It's like they all had some private competition on who can act the best...and they all won.Still, what makes Mamet's script work so well is that it's not just a vehicle for these incredible actors; it's loaded with calculated flavor and universal themes that have lived on and even became more socially relevant now than they were when the film was made. Along with all of this, I loved the little running motifs throughout the film; the use of chewing gum as a sign of power in the situations between characters, the constant passing of trains potentially used to symbolize how lost these men are and how they're all just running in circles. It's a brilliant achievement on every level and one that totally sings from start to finish.",Glengarry Glen Ross

The cinematography is beautifully moody and the vulgar wit comes flying at you at 200mph from the first scene. The specifically added Alec Baldwin character for the film is nothing short of brilliant and hilarious as he cuts down these salesmen with insults and threats instead of motivating them. There isn't a weak link amongst the cast and they all have their moments to spew some of the most acidic and profane dialogue ever written. This is a vicious comedy about the soul deadening and desperate world of salesmen and even with Mamet's stylized dialogue, there isn't a line that rings false.

Acting apart, which was exceptional (but then that pretty much goes without saying given the cast) there was very little in this film to appeal to anyone. We almost turned it off but saw it through to the end. But it was a storyline that could have been condensed down to a 5 minute piece and not lost anything. Group of salesman have poor leads & stage a break in. It was pretty much two 45 minutes scenes devoted to those two stories. There's not a lot else other than that & about 10,000 expletives of which about 98% of those we could have done without.It's enough to put anyone off the worlds of real estate & tele sales but then that was probably the point.3/10",Glengarry Glen Ross

Jonathan Pryce surprised me, instead of his polished car salesman self, he was convincing as the henpecked man who was taken in by the top salesman after too many drinks. Baldwin's scene was cruel and riveting.  My mother once worked in real estate and from the stories she told- the business hasn't changed much. I was also glad that Arkin who is usually frantic was subdued in his role.

Ok, they're hard driven salespeople trying to sell by any means necessary. They remind me of the kind of people, who would attempt to lighten the burden of a holiday bell ringers charity kettle.   The acting is top-notch, and manages to generate interest in the story, as one would expect with the amount of star power concerned. Alec Baldwin chews up the scenery with his five minute on-screen role. To see these neutered men quiver in their patent-leather shoes at the abuse that's thrown at them; has got to be one of the most affecting, unpleasant and memorable butt-chewings on film. This is, alas, the high point of the movie. The rest lulls around the depressing task of watching these dignity-deficient, desperate men sink even lower into the abyss.",Glengarry Glen Ross
96,Sonatine97,A Classic Death Of Four Salesmen,9,21 August 2002,"Very much a film adapted from the theatre but don't let that put you off for this is an excellent film from start to finish and the top notch actors seem to be enjoying themselves hugely in this male-only, testerone-filled screenplay.I can't say I'm much of a David Mamet fan. He is a very tedious and lazy author when it comes to adding more than the basic one dimension to a character or scene. And this isn't helped by his lack of imagination on the intellectual front, often resorting to vulgar language & confrontation.Having said that Director James Foley fleshes out the characters on Mament's behalf, although to be fair the casting for this film is exceptional when one considers the high quality of acting made available to him and thus making his job far more easier in the rather constrained & shallow Mamet screenplay.Foley really didn't have to get his message across too hard with people like Pacino, Lemmon, Arkin, Baldwin, Harris & Kevin Spacey at  his service. Most of these actors learnt their trade walking the boards in their pre-Hollywood days, so this film often a gentle return to the confines of a pseudo-theatre environment.The tension & claustrophobia that eminates from this film is really evident and only makes the story even more finely tuned & edgy. You almost feel as if you're watching some kind of reality-show or docudrama as these men fight for their lives getting people to buy their real estate and sign on the dotted line and finish king of the castle at the expense of his colleagues.Lemmon is the old hand, who more or less invented the art of cold-calling and knows all the scams like the back of his hand. And yet for all his success in the past it means nothing now, as he finds himself deeply in debt with medical bills, a more cynical public who are no longer interested in what he as got to sell, coupled with a more brutal and hardnosed management team that don't really care for his personal problems & frailties but demand more from him in better sales revenue.Pacino is the relatively young turk in the sales tea: succesful, cocky, self assured, confident, crafty and a person with an experienced eye & gift of the gab at spotting vulnerable members of the public in getting them to sign on the dotted line of a real estate contract the mug never really wanted in the first place.Ed Harris as the arrogant and scheming salesman, who feels very aggrieved at having to work for other people. He doesn't like the idea of his bosses taking away huge slices of his commission for themselves while he works himself into an early grave. He doesn't have many friends in the office and remain aloof & vulgar in his speech. He is frustrated, childish and ever closer to his first heart attack.Spacey as the young, relatively inexperienced, sales manager. He is clearly out of his depth at trying to ""marshall"" his sales force. Lemmon & Pacino in particular ridicule him & show him little or no respect because he has never done the kind of footwork they did when he was younger.And then there is the cameo from Alec Baldwin, as the champion salesman invited by  the chairmen of the company to give the office a bit of a shakedown and reality check in the arts of being a good salesman and getting people to sign those contracts.The story is excellent, the acting right across the board is a treat, although it could be argued that Pacino went a little over the top during times of anger and resorted back to his usual Pacino traits of lots of swearing, barging and confrontation but don't let that put you off.A very rewarding & absorbing film, that comes highly recommended*****/*****",Glengarry Glen Ross
97,HelloTexas11,how people talk,9,9 December 2007,"While 'Glengarry Glen Ross' deals with the world of real estate sales, anyone who has sold cars, vacations, investments or any number of other things that require a 'close' will be able to relate to the high-pressure desperation these salesmen, its characters, constantly live under. David Mamet's brilliant screenplay is a lesson in how to write dialogue. Taken from the play of the same name and embellished somewhat for the movie, Mamet's words are obscenely poetic, hypnotic in their effect and almost musical in their cadence. And make no mistake, they are obscene. The work 'fuck' is used something like 150 times in the course of the 100 minute film. But again, as anyone who has ever been part of this world can attest, that is precisely what makes 'Glengarry Glen Ross' so unflinchingly believable; that's how these people talk. Mamet hasn't created these characters so much as he's simply listened to them. Alec Baldwin's profane 'motivational' speech (written especially for the film) early on gives audiences an electric jolt of an idea what they're in store for. There is no pretense of appealing to the salesmens' better natures, no idealistic claptrap about what being a professional sales rep means; everyone in the room is far too jaded for any of that. No, Baldwin's spiel focuses on the only two things that matter to these men anymore- greed and desperation. Greed: first prize in this month's sales contest is a new Cadillac. Desperation: third prize is, you're fired. You're all losers, Baldwin tells them, you don't even deserve to be in my presence. And the salesmen are largely unfazed; you can see them sizing up Baldwin and his presentation, making mental notes. Jack Lemmon plays the oldest of the sales crew, someone who at one time made a lot of money selling real estate supposedly, but the bullshit and lies are so thick in this office, there's no way of knowing if that's true. Al Pacino is the current hot-shot; slick, smooth and cold-blooded. Pacino's sales pitch to Jonathan Pryce in a corner bar is such a masterpiece of obfuscation, we are no more certain of what Pacino is talking the customer into than Pryce is. All that one knows is at the end of it, he has a signature on the proverbial dotted line. Ed Harris and Alan Arkin are the other two salesmen and Kevin Spacey plays the office manager. Spacey in particular portrays an early version of the kind of chillingly heartless character he would become known for throughout his career. The title of 'Glengarry Glen Ross' refers to a set of leads (potential customers) that the real estate company management is dangling in front of the luckless reps, like some sort of golden carrot. They are to be handed out to the most productive salesmen. As with most high-pressure sales jobs, it's not even a matter of ""what have you done for me lately,"" it's more like, ""what have you done for me in the last thirty minutes?"" The last sale made is forgotten as soon as it's over and then it's on to the next. Yes, this movie is depressing and for anyone who's had to endure a job like this, it's like a flashback to the worst time in your life. One feels, and is intended to feel, that what these men do is a sad, sick, empty way to make a living. But it's also rewarding to watch these great actors giving bravura performances and delivering such unforgettable lines. 'Glengarry Glen Ross' is a film you'll not soon forget.",Glengarry Glen Ross
98,BloodTheTelepathicDog,Superior acting with a brilliant script,9,16 May 2005,"Granted the premise won't make people flock to see this, but the amazing talent involved should. Every actor involved delivers a stunning performance. This is hands down Alec Baldwin and Al Pacino's best work. They portray two selfish egotistical creeps that you'll love to loath.The plot centers around a group of salesmen all desiring to receive the promotional car for making the most sales. The plot doesn't have mass appeal, and is practically shot in two locations alone, but the acting will draw you in.The fact that this is basically about middle aged male whining and desperation, doesn't deteriorate it's value. Jack Lemmon is beyond brilliant, as the eldest salesmen, and most desperate, while young Ed Harris attempts to eclipse Golden Boy salesman Al Pacino. David Mamet's script gives the actors some great lines, and the setting to showcase their talents.This is a perfect example of a well made film, taking a boring premise and spicing it up with terrific acting and a first rate script.

99,Afracious,A ruthless and brilliantly acted ensemble piece,10,18 March 2000,"This is one of those rare films where it looks like the cast (all male in this case) are all at their best. Each one of the actors in this film is brilliant. The film focuses on a land and property sales office, and the various salesman and their problems. I think the most affecting and memorable performance is the one by Jack Lemmon. He plays Shelley 'The Machine' Levene, an arguing salesman in a bad streak, whose sales technique is slipping. He is desperate and needs good leads from his boss, Williamson (Kevin Spacey). Some of the scenes where he has to beg in the rain to him, and the final scene, make us feel sympathetic to him. The hot shot in the office is Ricky Roma, played by Al Pacino (who was Oscar nominated for his performance), he's a guy on a hot streak and can do no wrong, it seems. There's a great scene where Williamson reveals a secret to one of Roma's customers, then when the customer leaves the room Roma lets off one of the great tirades in cinema history. The other guys in the office are played by an acerbic Ed Harris as Dave Moss, who's in a bad streak, and laconic Alan Arkin as George. There is also a memorable motivative speech to all the guys from a ruthless Alec Baldwin, who tells them all to ""Get Mad!"". A brilliant piece of ensemble acting with many memorable scenes. One of the greats.",Glengarry Glen Ross

The acting was good, the cast was spectacular, and even the script was fine (even if it was loaded with too many curse words). I just feel that a film should never leave you thinking that question. A film should never ever ever do that to the viewer. Which to me is interesting only from the standpoint that any Mamet film I've ever watched has never done that. Not House of Games, not Heist, not even Spartan. So why this film? I suppose it's due to the fact that the audience wants some kind of justice for these dreary souls and they don't get any. Even Spacey's character, who is a jackass by the way, isn't taken down for his bad managing skills and complete lack of salesmanship knowledge. At least give us Baldwin's character's head or somebody halfway important. The feeling that all of these guys were monumental losers with the possible exception of Pacino's Romo just weighed you down and gave you a mixed feeling of disgust and shame. If this is what being a salesman is cracked up to be, then I'm relieved I have never been one.",Glengarry Glen Ross
101,Matthew_Capitano,'Glengarry Glen Dumbbells' -- and a short list of its obvious flaws,7,9 December 2016,"Pretty cool movie written by one of my favorite writers, David Mamet.A group of untalented salesmen are pressured by their company to hike their production numbers or else lose their jobs. Somewhat unbelievable script, but solid acting all around.Here are some of the film's inconsistencies:1. 'Blake' (Alic Baldin) asks if all those required to be at the meeting are present. Office manager Williamson (Kevin Spacy) says one guy, Roma (Al Pastinko), is absent, but Roma is the top salesman and he does not need to be there. Still, Blake says ""Well, I'm starting with the meeting anyway"". Later, Moss (Ed Haris) questions Williamson, ""Roma doesn't have to be here because he's the top man on the board?"", to which Williamson answers, ""That's correct!"").2. 'Blake' boasts of being a great salesman, but the 'leads' (prospective clients) which he speaks highly of, are, in fact, worthless, as Williamson states later (""Those clients are insane.... would you like to see the memo from the main office?"").3. Roma goes to the barfly's private home to meet the loser's wife. It makes sense that Roma would get the inebriated loser in the bar to sign a contract to buy unseen land, but the loser's wife is the smart one, as she sends the barfly to see Roma the next day to cancel the contract, therefore, why would the barfly's wife sign the contract, too?4. Roma accuses Williamson of losing him his bonus Cadillac for being 'Number 1' in sales for the month, and of ruining a deal Roma was working on which cost him his 10% cut from the deal, which is true... Roma would have lost that, but the bonus Cadillac Roma would get for being the top salesman in the office would still be his.5. How could the competition (developer Jerry Graff who works ""across the street""), be so stupid as to risk his business reputation and personal welfare by purchasing the stolen 'Glengarry Leads'?Also featured is the competent Jack Lemon and Alan Arken portraying a down-trodden soul. If Al Pastinko had any balls, he would have wanted to play the part of the loser, Levine (Lemon's character), instead of the 'top salesman', Roma, who is 'respected' while he walks around with a wad of money in his pocket. And of course, Roma doesn't have to be around for Blake's caustic verbal tirade, which is part of the reason Pastinko opted to play Roma).One question over-rides the entire proceedings: Why would these idiots stay with this terrible excuse for a job in the first place?",Glengarry Glen Ross

However, once the actually movie starts, the profanities start to fly.  Unfortunately this is the only memorable part of the movie (i forgot most of the plot).  The actors are so-so.  The storyline about competing salesman for a job is ok.  The most inane thing is the language, which is partially expected given the movies theme, but there are limits.

Ultimately propagating the conundrum of ""Are all of us going to burn in Hell?""The film starts out with the portrayal of three washed out salesman who are ready to be thrown to the wolves!! Alec Balwin is a motivator who comes in from corporate and dices all of the lackluster has-been salesmen to shreds..

Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin and Ed Harris are the three washed up salesmen who are toyed with and totally discarded for not producing!!What resonates in this film is the intensity of emotions that highlight the dark and psychologically negative aspects of failure!! You are making money, you are OK, you are not making money, you are not OK!! Suffice it to say, this is a masterpiece of understatement!!! An aging salesman is perpetually afflicted by ossification and despondence...If your career is finished, you in a sense are finished, and your emeritus years signify a painful non productivity...This should not be the case, however, being a closer as opposed to being a non-closer evolutionizes such a horrifying fate!!! The rejection these salesmen get is a lot colder than any Chicago winter that these salesman have experienced!! For these three, Chicago has become that toddling town that will let you down!! Stage play movies are often times my favorites!!! They raise the standards in cinema today!! The directing, the cinematography of the Chicago neighborhoods, and the aggregate irritation and unassuming aura which accommodates human failure by way of outdated restaurants and continuous subway noises, were all sensational in this movie.. Of course, the plethora of paramount acting performances by actors who are the best in the business is without a doubt this movie's stellar feature!!

Well, we do care about it, as we are drawn into this seedy world by characters that you come to care about.The dialogue is fantastic, and delivered by actors absolutely on top of their game. Jack Lemmon's sad, pathetic Shelly Levine character is stop-you-in-your-tracks good. A legendary salesman, now broke, insecure and still clinging to outdated sales techniques that used to work for him; powerless to help a daughter in need of extensive medical care; you can feel the sad, defeated rage from Lemmon as he desperately scrambles to convince his out-of-his-element boss (Kevin Spacey) how important he used to be, and how relevant he still is. These are fascinating and emotional scenes.The movie moves along well, as these guys scheme and schmooze their way through whatever life puts in front of them. Utter and classic B.S. artists who know they have spent their lives lying and rationalizing themselves, but resigned to not knowing any other way.The only purely honest, human conversations these guys have is with each other, complaining about each other and the conditions that they must work in.

106,lucasversantvoort,This is a lead worth checking out,9,6 May 2015,"Glengarry Glen Ross, despite its grim subject matter, is one of my favourite films. Based on David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, it intelligently dissects the life of the salesman in more ways than one, a bit like how The Sopranos dissected mob life. All the weirder then that Glengarry Glen Ross has actually been used to train salesmen. That'd be like if mobsters turned to The Sopranos for advice on how to succeed at mob life. I suppose it speaks favorable of the film's portrayal of a salesman's life, but the point of Glen Ross is not to serve as a training video.Glen Ross deals with the lives of a handful of real estate salesmen. All of them except for the highly successful Roma (Al Pacino) are struggling with lousy leads. One rainy night they're called to the office where they receive some troubling news: the higher-ups have created a contest: whoever earns the most money will get a brand-new Cadillac; second prize is a set of steak knives (aka you're fired); third prize is you're fired (aka you're fired). Not exactly a comforting prospect for the salesmen. Burdened with the prospect of losing their jobs, each salesman tries to make the best out of the situation the only way they can: by lying, scheming, robbing, manipulating and any combination thereof. When the office is robbed, the police arrive the following morning to interrogate each salesman privately.From a 'realism' standpoint, the script feels 'artificial' in a Paddy Chayefsky's Network kind of wayand that's a good thing. As Roma says at one point, ""anyone in this office lives on his wits."" Everything they say means something. Double meanings and subtext abound. These people aren't here to casually talk to one another, but to make money. This involves selling not just a product, but an illusion as seen when Roma rambles philosophically to a potential client before revealing a piece of land he could purchase. Language plays a pivotal role in the lives of these men and director James Foley ensures the film's editing emphasizes the flow of the dialogue. The script is indeed one of the best parts and screenwriter Mamet actually added parts, like Baldwin's diabolical monologue on the sales contest and how much the salesmen (except the absent Roma) suck at their jobs.The ensemble assembled here is one of the best ever: Pacino, Lemmon, Spacey, Harris, Arkin, Pryce and Baldwin are all present and accounted for. But rather than letting too many familiar faces ruin the immersion, this is a case where it all fits (which just makes it more puzzling why Glen Ross wasn't a financial success upon release.) One of the film's biggest successes is that its indictment of the life of salesmen doesn't up the drama to such a degree that the film becomes unwatchable. Rather, the script and the acting are highly enjoyable and engaging which makes the fact that you're basically watching all the salesmen (except Roma) struggle to put food on their table easier to swallow. A must watch.",Glengarry Glen Ross
107,ian_harris,Powerful Drama,7,21 January 2003,"I have never seen this work on stage, although it is one of Mamet's better known plays, but I was keen to see the movie as it has been heaped with such praise.A fine movie it is too, well acted.  The scenes between Al Pacino and Jonathan Pryce are especially strong, particularly the denouement scene between the two of them is magic.  Pacino is often singled out for praise (he won the Oscar for this performance), but Jonathan Pryce played his (smaller) role magnificently and is equally good.The other key pairing, Jack Lemmon and Kevin Spacey, didn't reach those giddy heights for me.  Well acted, granted, but somehow Lemmon just isn't a Shelley Levene to me and Kevin Spacey isn't the sinister but dim jobsworth Williamson.  Those two could work brilliantly together. I saw them play opposite each other in Long Day's Journey Into The Night (James and James Junior respectively, London circa 1986) and they were dynamite in that.  
The language in this film is ripe; you probably won't learn any new words but you will hear the phrase ""f*** you"" deployed in every conceivable tone of voice.  Janie and I have been rehearsing the cannon ever since we saw the film, for fun.I digress.  This is a truly powerful drama and well worth seeing.",Glengarry Glen Ross

Perfectly paced and absolutely real. The casting is impeccable.If an actor's calling is the search for truth within the character then we've got your truth RIGHT HERE.

I don't think there's one scene wasted or one scene where you can see them acting. Lemmon, Pacino, Arkin, Harris play their roles to perfection. Alec Baldwin is so incredibly good as Blake, the brutally honest sales motivator. The tension is thick as tree sap, and Lemmon's depiction of a salesman desperate for a sale comes through the screen like 3D emotion. Each captures nuances of salesman I have dealt with in my life. Lemmon reminds me of the salesman in The Simpsons with his folksy, but anxious attitude. (It's very surprising to hear him swear, which he does, alot). This movie isn't perfect. I didn't think Spacey's character was totally consistent (although I think he played it flawlessly, as they all did) and some scenes had a feeling of lag. But the acting is on a couple levels higher than just good acting. It's a movie that absorbs you and can watch over and over without it becomming tired. The acting is the real lure of the movie and it does not disappoint. 9/10",Glengarry Glen Ross
110,ebert_jr,Great beyond words.,10,25 February 1999,"The story unfolds almost entirely in the confines of a small dingy sales office. The goal: win the company sales contest. But this is no ordinary sales contest.  Management wants to cut back and weed out the underachievers.  The winners keep their jobs and just might get a new car to sweaten the deal.  The losers ""hit the bricks"" because ""they're going down!"".We're all familiar enough with being the victims of cold calls, poromotional junk mail, etc., but here, we see the pain of the other side and quickly become sympathetic to their plight.  Mamet lets us become so sympathetic he almost pulls us into each and every scene, making us cringe when a sale is blown or when a lead goes nowhere.I could go on and on about story details, the ""coffee is for closers"" scene, the awesome scene with Pacino trying to sell real estate to Pryce, etc., etc., but I'll just say this is one of the top films of the nineties and will surely be remembered as a great film in movie history.One other thing, the music by Wayne Shorter is as good as the acting and perfectly sets the mood for the film.

111,Det_McNulty,A Screenplay Which Uses Profanity As A Means Of Violence,9,21 October 2007,"""The best cast I've ever worked with"" said Jack Lemmon after filming Glengarry Glen Ross, and it is definitely no surprise as to why he would make such a bold statement. But what else do you expect from an ensemble of greats; including the likes of Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Jonathan Price and a cameo from Alec Baldwin. All of the cast are essential in driving the narrative and perform with utmost level of foul-mouthed professionalism.""It takes brass balls to sell real-estate"" exclaims Blake (played by Alec Baldwin), a corporate business tycoon. Furthermore, it is in this early monologue that Blake verbally abuses a group of real-estate workers and threatens to fire them all unless they produce tangible sales over the space of a few days. All of the men are handed defective leads, which are in urgent need of closing; the closer who comes first wins a Cadillac, the runner-up receives a set of steak knives and anyone else gets fired. It is a blunt and to-the-point story, which becomes exceedingly problematical after a break-in at the office, whereby the ""Glengarry"" leads are stolen. Soon the film becomes a vehicle for depicting greed, as each of the protagonists slyly con their colleagues, representatives and consumers for the one ""big break."" Brusque and dynamic mannerisms display the character's lust to win. Razor-sharp and profanity-laden dialogue will leave the viewer gasping for more. This callous language is what makes the film so exceptionally nail-biting. Grasping the upper-hand in the business world is a process which requires constant and immediate struggle. Due to deceitful manipulations the person in control is constantly shifting their status (this can be most notably observed during the final conversation between Kevin Spacey and Jack Lemmon). For the most part, Glengarry Glen Ross relies on its razor-sharp screenplay and weasel-like performances, but the technicalities are just as remarkable, mostly focused on creating a theatrically claustrophobic atmosphere. This is best suited, being that the piece is dedicated in keeping to its stage roots.Nevertheless, the cynical temperament enables the picture to become unhindered in its honesty, and transmits every misdemeanour with both wit and sincerity. The film's characters have been demoralised in the workplace because of the stream of verbal abuse, condescending lies and the concluding dismemberment of their drained existence. Arguably, the outdoor land that the real-estate agents are attempting to sell could be seen as a contrast to the office environment that they are so intensely surrounded by. Among the greatest films of the '90s, Glengarry Glen Ross contains a superb blend of all that is necessary in crafting an irreplaceable ensemble piece. Vulgar and essential, this is a picture brimming with depressing honesty and acidic realism. Not one to be missed, by any means.",Glengarry Glen Ross
112,shneur,Awesome drama,9,28 May 2006,"This is one of those films where it doesn't really matter what the story is, or even if there is one, because you are immediately and continuously enthralled by the outright skill of the cast. Here, though, David Mamet has adapted his own play for the screen, the result being a blend of Arthur Miller tragedy, Eugene O'Neill pathos, and a little Tennessee Williams thrown in for flavour. I felt as though I were being granted a coveted privilege of watching the iconic Jack Lemmon as the past-his-prime salesman, and the dynamo Al Pacino as the young hard-driving ""comer,"" interact at their unbridled best. Either of them would have totally overshadowed a weaker counterpart. Kevin Spacey plays the cold, self-interested office manager to the hilt. I'm sure James Foley was criticized for ""filming a stage production,"" but I say he did exactly the right thing to leave this Hall of Fame cast to bounce off each other and Mamet's story with minimal interference and no gimmicks.

114,tjsdshpnd,Thrilling without hardcore action scenes or Car crashes,8,1 September 2009,"It's a man's world out there and the right path may always not be the path to success when it comes to buying and selling real estate and this phenomena is best depicted in this realistic drama about four real estate salesmen - Played by Pacino, Lemmon, Harris and Arkin. All of them are a part of an average real estate organization which in order to maximize sales give their salesmen a week to increase their closes. The leads they get for this task are very mediocre and thus will test their salesmen capabilities. But frustration and failures make them take some drastic steps whose consequences they have to face for good.About the actors, Pacino plays an intelligent and opportunistic guy who is the salesman with the best record currently. Lemmon is the old and experienced guy whose sales record is not that good at the moment but is a big mouth. Harris plays the rebellious and short-tempered guy who has many ideas jumping inside him to make it big. Arkin is the soft-spoken, least confident guy who could not even talk properly to the customers on the phone. Baldwin has a very short scene in the movie but according to me that is the highlight. Spacey is the head of the branch and is the person who receives the most abuses in the movie. Another feature of this movie is the free usage of the 'F' word throughout (Especially directed towards Spacey). In short, this movie gets the thrills even without hardcore action scenes, car crashes etc. Highly Recommended.Rating : 8/10",Glengarry Glen Ross
115,Mr_PCM,"An interesting ensemble piece, but the actors let down by lack of strong plot",7,28 February 2006,"The cast of Glengarry Glen Ross was certainly promising at first glance, to say the least. With names like Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin and Jack Lemmon, expectations were high.Glengarry Glen Ross is a look at the behind-the-scenes machinations of a group of estate agents, what drives them, and how they go about 'closing' in their different ways. Alec Baldwin, in a film-stealing, scenery-chewing performance, is the boss who comes in and lights a fire under the agents with an aggression-fuelled job-threatening speech. He announces a sales competition where for those who come third and fourth the prize is the sack. Although only in the film for a few minutes for one speech, Baldwin sets the tone for the rest of the film. The rest are then sent out to try and 'close the leads'.The film is a rather dry and slow affair, more of a character study than a plot-driven story, at least at first. The vast majority of the action takes pace in their office, with brief interludes in a nearby Chinese restaurant. Harris, Pacino, Lemmon and Alan Arkin are all salesmen and we see how each of them go about their work in their own inimitable ways. However, the cast deliver an ensemble acting class. Pacino once again delivers a driven hothead performance, one straight from the repertoire. He has mastered this type of performance to the extent of making it look effortless, and adding to his list of endlessly quotable characters. It is also a joy to see Jack Lemmon and Pacino on the screen together; in probably his last great performance, Lemmon is at his best, and would have stolen the film had it not been for the charismatic performances of Pacino and Baldwin. But watching the master at work, especially in his scene with Pacino, make the film essential for any film fan; their interchanges seem so easy that they could be set as required viewing for acting classes.Glengarry Glen Ross makes an intriguing insight into what drives estate agents and how they conduct their business, and also the dynamics of office life in general, especially in times of crisis. The acting on display is almost universally superb (athough Ed Harris is perhaps guilty of slightly overacting  but that is something easy to do when working opposite Pacino) and the script is endlessly quotable. However the plot is rather slow to develop, and the opening forty-five minutes set at night make rather turgid viewing, and it is not until the morning after, in the light of an overnight office robbery, that the story comes to life. However, it then becomes fascinating to see the characters bounce off each other, and how sales incentives have driven them not only into more aggressive pursuit of clients but also in competing just as aggressively with co-workers in order to be number one.Definitely a fascinating film to watch, and a fitting swansong for the terrific career of Jack Lemmon, which on its own makes Glengarry Glen Ross essential viewing.",Glengarry Glen Ross
116,lee_a_scott,Needs talking cars in it!,7,29 March 2008,"Sometimes you watch a movie that everybody tells you is awesome. And it has performances (from, let's say, Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino and others, in blistering form) that you can see are pitch perfect. And it has a great script, with endlessly quotable lines and a well constructed premise. And, in fact, the whole thing reeks of class and quality and all of that good stuff. And it still, somehowjust, sort of leaves you cold. I'm sure that Glengarry Glen Ross is great  that many critics must be right, but it really didn't do much for me. I watched the new Knight Rider pilot this morning, and enjoyed it more. Maybe I'm just a philistine, but the fact that I feel guilty about it suggests that maybe I just don't care about salesmen but do quite like talking cars.",Glengarry Glen Ross

Glengarry Glen Ross was by far the biggest movie surprise for me this year. I'm stunned that I hadn't seen that yet.The play by David Mamet is very good, it has twists and keeps your mind intense and I love that about movies. I think that most of the dialogue throughout the movie is very well written. The text is absolutely pure gold. The way the salesmen express themselves is so straight-forward, so characteristic, so unafraid that it's absolute pleasure to watch.The cast is first class. Al Pacino looks and talks like a real salesman. For me he gives one the finest performances of his illustrious career. Jack Lemmon is at his best in the old days. Kevin Spacey is really cool and calm at his role. On the other hand, Ed Harris plays a troubled salesman who's unstable and nervous. Alan Arkin is a coy salesman and he's doing fine. A real pearl is Alec Baldwin with his 7 minute monologue speech. That's what I call statement.I like office movies only when the story is really good or the characters are very interesting and played extremely well. This movie here offers both so I'm thrilled.",Glengarry Glen Ross
118,starlit-sky,Marvellous Performance from a marvellous cast.,7,2 July 2001,"Glengarry Glen Rose, for one thing, is a movie with a marvellous cast who put out a marvellous performance that is worth watching for its own sake. The movie casts Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Kevin Spacey (who won 2 Academy Awards in the following years), Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin and Alan Arkin all of whom put out impeccable performances that literally blaze across the screen. The story takes place in a real estate sales office where the salesmen face the fact that they are going to have to close more deals to reach their targets or they will lose their job after given a lecture by the tough top executive, Blake (Alec Baldwin). The problem is that they believe the leads given to them are no good, meaning that the customer list delivered to them to make the deals is dead-ends. One thing they know though is that John Williamson (Kevin Spacey), the manager of the office, has the leads to famous Glengarry Leads, which is a list of customers who are much more potential than the ones they currently have. However John is only allowed -by the company policy- to give the Glengarry leads to the salesmen who succeed in closing the deals. Next thing you know all the salesmen are thinking of ways to get their hands on the Glengarry leads, except for Ricky Roma (Al Pacino) who is not so concerned because he is the best salesman in the office anyways. This is a must see for all the movie lovers, a chance for them to appreciate the actors like Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey and Ed Harris. The story takes place in one or two locations and revolve around only a couple of characters almost to the point of making the movie look like as it would have better been a play but the performances of the actors are so splendid that this drawback is redeemed easily. All of the actors here -not just Al Pacino-could have been nominated for an Oscar very easily, including Jonathan Pryce, who plays Roma's client, Mr. Lingk; even though his time is very short, his acting is splendid. For reminder, Al Pacino was nominated for a ""The Best Supporting Actor"" for his performance in this movie in the same year he won ""The Best Leading Actor"" award for his performance in ""Scent Of Woman"".",Glengarry Glen Ross

That is, when they're not *ucking over their customers in the truest form of salesmanship.  The ending perfectly ties up the whole *ucking story.

It's one terrific movie, with great characters enacted by some of the best actors in film. Not to mention the razor sharp dialog with some of the finest lines ever written!The film begins with a scene on one rainy night, when some real estate salesmen are subjected to a very harsh speech by Blake (Alec Baldwin) on how to make the right sales. They have to work much harder now (for which he announces three prizes), or they lose their jobs (that's the third prize!)! The film catches on from there, and we immediately start relating to the desperate situation these guys are in.Al Pacino had an Oscar nomination, and he was great, but I think Jack Lemmon deserves kudos for his portrayal of Shelley Levene. He breathes so much life in his character, it just goes to show the amount of importance there is to casting the right man to portray the right character! An all-male cast, the choice of actors is perfect: Kevin Spacey, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Al Pacino, Alan Arkin....Alec Baldwin makes a brief appearance but he practically rules the screen in that one scene. His dialog with the others present in the office is priceless!Even Jonathan Pryce appears very convincing in his short role.This one is highly recommended.

Ultimately, it's about survival.This is one of the movies that i watched which is quite similar to a theater play.

The dialogue although hard to understand at times really makes you connect with the characters in a strong way. Their visceral reactions towards each other and the desperation that you hear in the voices make for interesting characters with interesting backgrounds. You find yourself working out how each of the characters in this piece got to this point in their life. Set in the era of the real estate period in American history so basically 80's onwards to the 00's before finance became coolish at the turn of century, a boring industry full of con artists and aggressive personalities.

126,underfire35,One Of The Best Films Ever...,10,23 July 2003,"A: Always B: Be C: ClosingGLENGARRY GLEN ROSS is about real estate agents. A group of working men out there trying to earn a living just like everyone else. The film takes us inside the pressure cooker of a second-rate Chicago real estate office and the world of dead-beats, sits, streaks, and Cadillac boards. Where if you don't close, it's your job. Where desperate, angry men will do anything to get ahead, to get the premium leads. When two people ""talking"" and ""speaking"" about something mean different things, and listening can make you a criminal. When a man can look at the office across the street and see heaven, but in truth it's no better than where he's standing...just different. It is fascinating material, all the more so because I happen to be a salesman. GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS is the film that introduced me to the work of Chicago playwright David Mamet. I have since become endeared to the profane scherzo of the dialectic, the use of obscenity in a gritty realistic way; the cadence, the tempo and meter. Mamet, who wrote the script based on his lean play, uses small details to set a character up, instead of falling back on clichés. There are no flashbacks or other tricks here, the information is supplied by what the character says in the throw-away lines and quick asides. In addition, Mamet has fleshed out the story line quite a bit for the film. Including the addition of Blake (Alec Baldwin), the guy ""from downtown, from Mitch & Murray"", whom Mamet uses to introduce the sales incentive, which serves as the catalyst of the drama: ""third prize is you're fired"". In his brief scene Baldwin chisels a realistic and frightening performance.The rest of the cast speaks for itself: an inspired Jack Lemmon as the powerfully desperate Shelly ""The Machine"" Levene; Al Pacino as the seductively slick Ricky Roma; Ed Harris in a bravado performance as Dave Moss, George Aronow, the hapless, but likable everyman played by Alan Arkin; Kevin Spacey as the street-lame office manager; and Jonathan Pryce in an effective role as a cuckold client. Each of the gifted cast members fall into the vibe of the speech and action that Mamet brings to the story. The director, James Foley, and his crew stay out of the way of the actors. With that much energy in a cast, to overstage the scene would have been distracting, throwing off the balance of the language. Foley knows it's about the characters and not about his personal style as a film maker; for that I give him credit. GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS is lightning in a bottle, a unique film with a great cast. A highly under-rated gem. 10/10.",Glengarry Glen Ross

If you like action movies only, give this one a go on a slow day when you just want to sit back and relax for awhile. I was in sales for awhile and the scene with Lemmon holding out the pen is a classic sales move. You say sign here, hold the pen out and the first person to speak loses.

130,kingbk-2,An Analysis of the Nature of Men,9,1 May 2013,"Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent film from 1992 based off David Mamet's critically acclaimed stage play. Some might think it's about men trying to save their jobs, but more it's an analysis of the nature of man when faced with obstacles and what lengths he'll go to in overcoming them.Taking place in a major city similar to New York or Chicago, most of the story unfolds in a nondescript office that seems to look like a dungeon. This is a great parallel to the pressure the men feel in their role as prisoners inside this dungeon. They work for a second or third tier real estate company, selling overpriced land in shady ways to terrible leads. The working conditions are poor and the employees get almost no support or encouragement from their meek, by the book boss John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) or from the out of sight, out of mind owners Mitch and Murray. Each salesperson has their own distinct personality: Ricky Roma (Pacino) is the charming, hot-shot sales expert who stands atop the sales leader board, Shelley Levene (Lemmon) is the aging, past his prime veteran who's value with the firm is quickly dropping and whose personal life like his professional life is falling apart, Dave Moss (Ed Harris) is the frustrated, angry middle aged man who's tired of the conditions he experiences everyday at the office and is ready to fight back, and George Aaronow (Arkin) is the weak, pathetic man who really has no business working in sales other than the fact that he's desperate for work.Things change for the office when ""downtown"" sends Blake (Alec Baldwin in perhaps his best performance ever), an extremely successful sales rep, over for a sales team meeting. The cocky, abusive Blake rips the men apart for their poor sales and instills in them acronyms like ""ABC"" and ""ADIA"" to help them sell more. He also informs the men that only the top two sales reps will keep their jobs while the other two will be fired. The top rep wins a car and second place a set of knives. He ends the meeting by giving the valuable Glengarry leads to Williamson until the sales team proves that they are closers. Under this new pressure, the men take drastic measures to try as hard as they can to close business.What makes this movie so great is the simplicity of it. There's no flash, no major action items, but terrific chemistry between the actors, characters and conflict through dialog. Pacino, Baldwin, Lemmon, Spacey, Harris and Arikin all give top performances. Also, the movie hits home about what many men (and women) go through in the work place daily. Many work in similar situations with little hope, little opportunity and little salary. The desperation, the language, the pressure, the conflict and the fear that is shown in the movie is very real for millions who need to put food on the table and face an uphill climb to do so.Glengarry Glen Ross is an excellent commentary on the condition of man and what he has to do to overcome it.

An 100% actors movie and it doesn't show anything more than what the play that it is based on intended, which means it only relies on the script, dialog and the acting. And it delivers big time, even with those constraints. Imagine somebody trying to play a symphony with an acoustic guitar and succeeding. This movie doesn't use anything but the very essence of storytelling but it roars like a lion, it literally glues your eyes to the screen. What's more, the story is not that interesting, it is the blunt frankness with which a day in the life of a group of real estate salesmen is presented to the audience. And the dialog is something else.... When I discussed this movie with people, I noticed that the ones who really identify are the ones who worked in a sales team of some sort. Of course, to my horror, some of my fellow ""critics"" were ""getting it"" but they...guess what...AGREED with ALEC BALDWIN and the whole ""f***'em up and get them selling"" routine. Can you get any yuppier than that? Holy smokes! Not much to say about the actors, except they were BLOODY MARVELOUS. The Baldwin speech is in my top 10 of memorable quotes, the over-the-top swearing and quarrel in the end between Lemmon, Spacey, Pacino and Harris is hilarious (not necessarily in a positive way) and the whole Jack Lemmon character is pure genius. In case you never worked in a sales team that promotes a hard-to-sell product and you're wondering how realistic this film is, IT IS REALISTIC. And by the way, stop writing comments on IMDb.

135,abyoussef,Sell... or Die.,10,25 March 2004,"by Dane YoussefWell-played, well-written look at the bottom rung on society--salesman. Real-estate, exactly.Yes, it's a ""photographed play."" Like just about every other play adaptation to the big screen... but it's so well done, you don't care. Like ""The Odd Couple"" or... ""Lost In Yonkers...""The actors thankfully move outside the office a bit (outside the building, in cars, phone booths, restaurants... and at one point, over to someone's house)This could have been called ""Life of A Salesman."" Men who dedicate their lives to selling real estate. Land and so forth. Not as easy and as coast-worthy as it all seems.God, what a racket. These people are all so cynical, bitter and desperate. They're claustrophobic and turning on each other. Their whole source of income and life rely on these little cards. ""Leads."" Little cards with names, numbers and addresses of people who want to buy land. But some of them are so old...A red-hot salesman from downtown (Alec Baldwin, in a role written especially for him) comes down to motivate, drill and berate everyone into bringing their numbers up. When another salesman makes the mistake of protesting against all the abuse and calling Blake on his rant, Blake decides to put him in his place.He flashes his watch. He shows off his car. ""I made $970,000 last year. How much you make? Mitch & Murray asked me to come down. To help get the numbers up. As a favor. I told them that the real favor would be to take my advice and fire you. Because a loser is a loser.""Then Baldwin shows the 'Glengarry Glen' leads. He holds them and shows them off to the other salesman like he's holding the royal crown jewels. The hope diamond. The holiest of holy grails. Well, to these guys... they are. Baldwin remarks smugly, ""These are the new leads. These are the Glengarry leads. To you, these are gold... and you don't get them. Why? Because to give them to you is just throwing them away."" I like when Ed Harris starts to protest of this guy's dressing-down and Baldwin snaps back. He shows no mercy. Drills right through him. This is some of the best Baldwin has ever done.""You see this watch? You see this watch? That watch costs more than you car. I made $970,000 last year. How much you make? You see pal, that's who I am, and you're nothing.""Then he FINALLY drops the bombshell. ""We're adding a little something to this month's sales contest. As you all know, first prize is a Cadillac Eldorado. Anybody want to see second prize? Second prize is a set of steak knives. Third prize is you're fired.""And there are more than three salesman in the office. One way or another, a lot is going to be trimmed. Not necessarily fat. Just... trimmed. A lot. To save money.The characters are sharply drawn and in a story that is intertwined and sown together with skill and surprise. The all-star cast does the best with Mamet's angry, fierce and realistic speak (the adaptation is by Mamet himself, from his Pulitzer-Prize winning play). Pacino is (as always, blistering) as the star salesman who's landed the top of the board with his fresh catch James Linsk (Alan Arkin).Ed Harris as Dave Moss is good as an angry, self-righteous salesman who's just such a jerk. An arrogant S.O.B. A great moment is when someone finally deflates him. Pops the big bag of hot air. Shows him to be scared and insecure underneath it all. His repeated cries of ""F-ck you!"" just reveal how truly desperate and insecure he truly is...The buttoned-down office manager John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) who's ""by the books to the core"" and has never been out there, selling it, in the sh*t a day in his life. He's just a company man. ""A secretary... and white bread"" as some of the salesman in the office call him.But the true breadwinner is the touching elderly Jack Lemmon as Sheldon ""The Machine"" Levene. Once the office golden boy, he was ahead and selling big week after week after week... reigning the very top of the board. The owners used to say things like ""That car, that trip to Bermuda... you bought that for me..."" Now he just can't sell. He sounds so grandfatherly and princely on the phone... you want to trust him so much. He's like Santa Claus.But Shelley cannot find anyone who wants to buy. All the name and address cards (""leads,"" they're called) are older than Lemmon. Many have moved on and found better service elsewhere. The machine is longer up and running and Lemmon does a magnificent job of painting him a portrait of a burned-out star. A has-been. It's painful to look into those big sad dog-eyes of his...He at one point goes to the house of someone who just doesn't want to buy. That's understandable, isn't it? Hey, how many times have you met a salesman who just won't get it. But Shelley's desperate. He bargains. He pleads. He drops his price. No sale. His heart seems to be breaking when...There are many a great moment in ""GGL."" Where Baldwin drills the troops, when Harris is hoisted on his own petard, when Lemmon works his old time magic with potential customers... and when a salesman pulls a hustling con on a customer... all to have one misunderstanding--a split second blow the deal.It would be unfair to go on with how the rest plays out. Suffice to say that it is worth watching again and again and again. The whole movie. It's a hard-boiled classic. Look for it wherever you can. Ask for it by name: ""Glengarry Glen Ross.""--Personally Believing In The Mantra: ""Always Be Closing,"" Dane Youssef",Glengarry Glen Ross
136,miloc,"Good, within its limits",6,17 November 2005,"This movie has undeniable qualities: some of the best dialogue since the glory days of Billy Wilder, and a talent-packed dream-team cast (though the latter is never a guarantee; if it was, ""Yellowbeard"" would have been the greatest comedy of its era).But ultimately it's a filmed play, and director Foley's failure to find anything visually interesting to do with it makes the movie feel more like a television program than anything else, albeit an unusually fine one. While this isn't necessarily a killing drawback, it doesn't provide a reason to see the film rather than a good stage production.The compensation lies in the performances. For Alec Baldwin to steal the show from the line-up around him is a work of unparalleled larceny, and yet he does, with the help of a painfully funny new monologue provided by Mamet. The ghost of amusement in his voice as he asks, ""Oh, have I got your attention now?"" is something terrible to hear. He is Contempt Incarnate, and the outrageousness of the scene borders on the surreal.The rest of the cast is predictably good, with Harris and Arkin particularly adept at Mamet's cross-talk rhythm, Pacino masterfully arrogant, and Spacey, before he had hit stardom, icily memorable. Lemmon goes further; his work here has some of the iconic quality of his performances of the 1960s. (The ""Simpsons"" character modeled on Lemmon's Shelley isn't a bad bell-weather for enduring pop resonance.) The crawling sense of need he projects becomes something genuinely uncomfortable to watch. Arriving at a young couple's house drenched in rain, his gray-white hair plastered flat, and his mouth pulled back in its ghastly salesman's smile, he captures something alarmingly real about the price of failure in America. As his sales pitch evaporates he is at last left only with an increasingly forced chuckle. In a life that consists only of patter, tragedy is having nothing left to say.",Glengarry Glen Ross
137,Nimbo,Such dialogue,10,15 February 2000,"I once saw David Mamet on a Dick Cavett show perhaps in the 70's and I was impressed with his wit and overall charm. I wrote him a short letter attesting to his performance and amazing as it may seem, he sent me a postcard from San Francisco thanking me for my interest. I was a resident of that wonderful city at the time. Why am I writing this? To let him know if he reads this that I think he is an incredible writer. Glengary Glen Ross is totally absorbing in the verbal exchange between the characters. It is so true to life. You end up despising all of the real estate salesmen because they toy and play with the truth and are all downright dishonest. Each has a price. At the end when Spacey says to Lemmon 'I despise you, always have', I only wish Lemmon had said the same about him. They all were despicable and so alluring in their lives of lies.

Over time this movie has grown on me, to the point that my wife won't let me watch it anymore, particularly if I've had a couple of coffees (""put that coffee DOWN""). At my workplace, I often confront officious co-workers with the classic Jack Lemmon line ""What the hell are you? You're a ****ing secretary, **** you!"". It's a wonder I still have a job.

141,jaysilentbob37,I listen to this movie with the same joy as I do a favorite song,10,27 December 2011,"I'm not entirely sure what to say about Glengarry Glen Ross without dumbing it down to blind praise. It's easily in my all time top 20 films I've ever seen, and it gets everything right. It has a dream cast and a level of intelligence that's unheard of in movies these days. Need lots of action and cheap thrills? You'll most certainly hate it. Do you enjoy high quality dialogue in your movies? Then it's like porn. Better than porn actually, seeing how you can watch Glengarry Glen Ross over and over and it will always be just as great.This awkwardly titled classic comes from a play by David Mamet, who also wrote the script. It's a dark, profane, bitter, and cynical story about an office full of sleazy, lowlife salesmen (Pacino, Lemmon, Harris, and Arkin) who's job is to get in contact with cold potential customers (leads), and pass off what's essentially uninhabitable swampland as prime real estate. The job is naturally an exercise in futility, as most of the men are performing very below average, despite their most desperate efforts. The fact that the good leads are being held back by their boss (Spacey) until management sees some results isn't helping either. The situation is a humiliating paradox, that becomes outright desperate when a manager (Alec Baldwin) comes to the office from headquarters and announces a motivational sales contest that will mean prizes for the winners and unemployment for everyone else.The characters are developed to perfection, and it is their words and reactions to the situation at hand that make this film such a work of genius. Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), has nothing to worry about. He's pretty much always been the top salesman at the office, treating his sales more like tangent-laced seductions, one of which we see working effortlessly. Unfortunately for everyone else, Roma's guaranteed victory narrows down the potential winners. The other guys have varying, but equally desperate reactions to this.Shelley Levine (Jack Lemmon) is the oldest of the salesmen, and while he was once Roma's equal, he has been seriously slipping in his age and hasn't closed a sale in a very long time. He's in a desperate family situation, which is unspecified, but clearly severe enough that he can't afford to lose his job. He starts by trying to bribe their boss, Williamson (Kevin Spacey), and when that doesn't work, he tries to worm his way into the home of a family who are just as set on buying nothing as he is on selling anything. It's painful to watch, even though the character is unlikeable in many ways.And then there's Dave Moss (Ed Harris) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin). These guys have never been near the top, and now their expendability is here to haunt them. George spends the night listening passively as Moss pontificates on everything wrong with their office, which may or may not turn out to be justifying a robbery. Because the next morning, the office is found burglarized. And although Moss was the only one to verbalize his desire to do so, everyone has a reason to. The morning after the robbery, these situations all come to a head and the men are all exposed for the backstabbing scumbags they really are, particularly when Roma's customer from the night before shows up intent on canceling the sale.The dialogue sizzles. It is some of the best dialogue Mamet ever wrote, which is saying a lot. Every actor sinks into their role, and it's hard to single out a stand-out performance aside from Alec Baldwin's ten minute appearance delivering an unforgettably cruel and venomous speech. Jack Lemmon, most well-known from classic movies like The Apartment and Some Like it Hot, is hard to forget in this movie with a character who is incredibly unlikable, yet still sympathetic. Everyone plays a shade of unlikable in this film, but as far as characters you'll love to hate goes, Kevin Spacey's Williamson takes the cake. He has the easiest job in the office, and he treats his employees like his position makes him more important to the company. He is a complete tool in every way, and when he screws over Roma, you can bet that Al Pacino will dish out the verbal assault to end all verbal assaults (""Who told you that you could work with MEN?!""). It's a completely satisfying moment, as memorable as any of Pacino's best moments from The Godfather, and it's all the better since you totally feel that Spacey's character deserves it.I could gush over this movie scene after scene all day. It's not so much a movie that appeals to me on a personal level as it is one that plays like a great piece of music. The dialogue is as pleasurable to the ears as great music, and the movie has a stagy yet lyrical quality that sucks you in and doesn't let go. It's one of the most fast-paced films you'll ever see, with two very distinct acts. The movie is over before you know it. Even if it bores you to tears, it'll be over before you realized you were bored. Overall, give the movie a chance. It's the best compilation of writing and acting since 1976's Network.",Glengarry Glen Ross

But if you can put aside all that, there are some interesting visuals.

Quite the contrary, some people can work together for years and never know they hate each other.It is honest in that salesmen, to be good, must be amoral predators. But they are also professional phonies. This is where the film fails, for salesmen are phony with everyone, even each other. The frank, unvarnished honesty these men displayed to each other, the naked hatred and contempt, is the part I don't buy. Any group of men who worked together like that would soon kill each other.No, this script would have been far more superb if it had found someway to reveal all the hostility behind all the phony masks we wear.

145,zippyflynn2,A Film for the Gourmet,10,11 March 2007,"You won't find any fluff in this production. No empty filler, meaningless beyond its superficial appeal for the shallow, short attention span crowd. What you will find is a marvelously constructed film that will be appreciated and admired by a mature and serious audience, particularly those who are hungry for a substantial gourmet meal in a sea of cheap, seemingly endless junk food. This is one of those rare moments in a production when every role, from actor to editor, was filled by just the right person. If anyone is a serious student of acting, film making, or play production you can't ask for a better study tool than this film. Every actor was perfect for his role, even Kevin Spacey, who I always find has a contrived ""acting"" undertone to his work but that quality is perfect for the tight a*sed character he plays. And what can you say about the other roles other than brilliant, certainly these performances all rank among the top of each actor's resume. This is also David Mamet's best play, the most tightly written, polished and textured. He is certainly the serious actor's writer, no one writes more textured and honest characters using real dialog that fits together like an intricate, well oiled machine. My only complaint with him, though, is when he directs. He has said that the actor is only there to ""read the lines as written"", claiming all the emphasis of any production should be based on the writing. Well as you can clearly see elsewhere, great writing can get butchered by a bad production and many a so-called great films have just been great executions of mediocre scripts. Overvaluing the writing (or any specific element) can be a big disservice to other aspects of a production, in this case the acting. James Foley did a marvelous job, rehearsing over and over again until the end result was the beautifully polished performances you see here. It's really a disappointment to not see him do any other film adaptations of Mamet's work to date, clearly this is his best work and the best adaptation of Mamet's as well. What a shame there has been no more further films with this paring. The editing and soundtrack are also brilliant, giving us a rare treat, a masterpiece that stands up under repeated viewings and clearly will over the years to come.

147,murray_johnc,The All Star Cast is a Departure for a Mamet Film,7,11 July 2017,"Most of David Mamet's movies have been better scripted and relied on far fewer star actors. I wonder why this movie got the star treatment when other Mamet movies have done fine with the usual stalwarts - Ricky Jay, Rebeca Pigeon, William H. Macy, etc? The casting is unusual in having no women in the sales office (since female real estate agents far outnumbered male real estate agents back when the screenplay was written). For the movie Mamet added the Baldwin character, so theoretically he could have added a hard, aggressive bitch to the sales team to spice things up. The dialog is typical Mamet fare, it adds punch and pizazz but in real life I've never ever witnessed people verbally exchange like that! There are some plot events that simply don't make sense. The hapless Jack Lemon thinks he's hit the sales jackpot only to be deflated when told that the couple who signed his $80,000 sales contract have a history of being insolvent wackos; office manager Williamson (Spacey) already knew all about this, yet he assigned Shelley a complete time-waster. Why? managers are supposed to optimize business efficiency not sabotage it. Did Williamson do it out of malice or carelessness? We later learn he and Shelly intensely disliked one another? Most people (myself included) would rather clean toilets for a living than face that bleak future of endless sleaze, stress and abuse on all sides, but as this DVD's supplementary piece ""Always Be Closing"" showed, there are real-life real estate saleswomen who actually love cold-calling!

But ... this is a movie and all the talking and talking gets tiring and boring. Talking is acceptable when dealing with critical subjects (take for example ""Conspiracy"").

I'd never seen it before--wasn't interested when it first came out in theatres, had never even seen the play on stage--but I'd heard Baldwin was brilliant in it, so I bought it.Now I'm kicking myself for never having seen it on the big screen. And I've seen it at least a dozen times since buying it.The story, if you've read any reviews, you already know: Four guys in a real estate office (Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, and Al Pacino) are in a sales contest from ""Mitch and Murray"", the big bosses from downtown. As the slick-suited real estate millionaire sent to motivate the sales force (Baldwin, in a role written expressly for the film) explains, ""First prize is a Cadillac.[...]Second prize is a set of steak knives. Third prize is you're fired."" With such motivation complete, Office Manager Williamson (Kevin Spacey, in his first big role) hands out the night's allotment sales leads, and they're pure drek...driving the men to various stages of desperation to ensure they don't fall off the sales board.That's the story. What makes this movie work is the outstanding performances. Pacino as office hot-shot Ricky Roma got the film's only Oscar nod for acting, but the late, great Jack Lemmon's performance as Shelley ""The Machine"" Levine would have been a better choice. Levine hasn't had a sale in months, and has lost his edge; his scene bargaining with Williamson for a better lead capsulizes Levine's frustration and fears perfectly. Just to watch Lemmon, a wondrous actor, bring every nuance of this character to life is fascinating; it is truly one of the best performances of Lemmon's career, and one of the most underrated.As for the reason I bought this in the first place, Alec Baldwin? He's magnificent. You'll forget he's only in one scene; his character's threats and emotional manipulation swirl through every scene in the film. His profanity-laced motivational speech is searing; you can feel every man in the room cringe as he verbally emasculates them in the name of generating more sales for the unseen Mitch and Murray. And the film's most quotable lines come from him: ""Put that coffee down! Coffee is for closers."" ""What's my name? F--k you, that's my name! You know why? Because you drove a Hyundai to get here, and I drove a $80,000 BMW. THAT'S my name."" ""A-B-C--Always Be Closing. Always Be Closing. ALWAYS BE CLOSING!""Enough talking.

Alec Baldwin's pep talk to the sales team is one of the finest movie moments ever. This is a movie full of bile, anger, frustrations and dreams.

A small group of salesman, who have struggled to close any deals recently are given an ultimatum: close your next few deals of else lose your job. For a little added incentive, the man who makes the most sales will win a Cadillac.  Simple enough storyline, you might think but the magnificent ensemble acting is a joy to behold and makes the film truly great.  Al Pacino, as always, stands out as hotshot salesman Roma and the supporting players are just as impressive, including Alan Arkin, Kevin Spacey and a particularly fiery Ed Harris.  Even Alec Baldwin turns up in a memorable cameo early on.  However, for me, the real star of the show was the late Jack Lemmon who played the frustrated loser to perfection and really made you feel pity for his character.

158,RueMorgue,Excellent film about everyday life in the working world.,8,3 June 2000,"I had put off watching this film for a long time.  I have always seen David Mamet as an excellent screenwriter and director, and I look forward to seeing what he has done for the upcoming ""Hannibal"".  However, this film didn't seem to be one that would hold my interest.After finally viewing it, nothing could be further from the truth.  This is another of Mamet's excellent efforts.  I have always found Mamet's characters to be his strong point, and this is no exception.  His representation of the average working man is right on par.  This movie centers mainly on the characters, and not on outside events which they cannot control.  Each of the main characters in this film are responsible for their own actions, and they each decide their fate.  An excellent character study.Jack Lemmon shines in his role, as do Al Pacino and Kevin Spacey.  (In fact, Al Pacino was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.) Of course, we can't expect anything else from these actors, as all have shown themselves to be highly regarded in dramatic roles.  Ed Harris makes a good showing, and Alec Baldwin is surprisingly effective as well.As I have mentioned in other reviews, I often like to be entertained while having to think about a film at the same time.  This film allows for this. However, while this is an excellent Mamet film, it's not his best.  For one of his best in my opinion, have a look at ""Homicide"", but don't let young children watch it because of the excessive (but still not overdone) coarse language.My Rating:  8/10",Glengarry Glen Ross
159,knight_armour,Stellar Acting,8,1 December 2005,"I hadn't heard much about this movie before watching it but since it had an all-star cast, I figured it couldn't be too bad. I was wrong because it turned out to be excellent. In fact I found myself not wanting for it to end so soon. The movie is heavily conversation based but the script is so good that it easily carries the movie way beyond any need for a lot of action or suspense. Kevin Spacey delivers his usual style and Pacino, along with Jack Lemmon really shine. Alec Baldwin delivers a great performance as well with his opening scene. Ed Harris is the angriest of the lot but he has some of the most difficult lines yet delivers them smoothly. Just by watching this movie, you begin to understand what good actors really are. This is one film where I can safely say that my time was well spent watching.",Glengarry Glen Ross
160,Sneaky_Pete_XXVII,One of the top dialogue driven stories,10,14 December 2003,"Like I mentioned in my summary, this movie is dialogue driven...Is it ever! And in my opinion, only good films, can be dialogue driven. And this isn't a good film...It's a GREAT and GRAND film! And I hope that no one else thinks otherwise. Along with the incredible dialogue, I also think that the cast is brilliant. Not for a second, am I thinking that these men are actors (Well, except for Alec Baldwin). And that is a good trait of a good actor.There's two particular characters that stick out the most in my mind: Jack Lemmon and Kevin Spacey. Boy, do these men ever play the roles well! I really admire some of the actors like Pacino and Harris, but I couldn't believe, when I finished the movie, what an amazing job Lemmon and Spacey did. And one last thing that I'd like to mention, that ties into both the dialogue and the acting...the setting. The reason this fits in with both dialogue and acting is because you're so involved with the characters interactions that you don't need any actions or change of scenery. It fits and works well. And perhaps if the setting had change it might of taken away from the scene. And as far as acting is concerned, I think that if you don't have good acting within the scene, you get bored and do focus on the facts (like setting), that you shouldn't.So, all these elements get thrown into one story, one film, that makes it both great and grand, and this work of art is known as ""Glengarry Glen Ross"".",Glengarry Glen Ross

162,cineastFGD,What a terrible movie,1,21 April 2015,"I watched this movie because it was praised so highly and the cast was really impressive, but dammit, how I regret to have spoiled two hours with this crap. This movie in a nutshell is: it's a (white) men's world. It is basically the essence of (white) men's understanding of masculinity: materialistic competition, concurrence, camaraderie, pressure, power, and cockfighting. The dialogues are so full of swearing that you want to wash the characters' mouths with a big piece of soap. I'm not very sensitive when it comes to language, but I really fail to see the brilliance in a dialogue that mainly consists of ""Fuck you!"". There is no storyline, the characters have no depth, actually they are so shallow and cliché that it hurts. We learn nothing about them during the entire movie and therefore don't have a clue what is driving them, hurting them, etc..The scenery is depressing, the atmosphere is depressing, and half way through this incredible dull joke of a movie I started looking at my watch, hoping it might be over soon. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that there might be an interesting and twisted finale, but, surprise, the film literally just stops, 'sorry we ran out of ideas and are done now'. It seems like the only purpose of the story was to figure out who might end as a winner in a gigantic cockfight. So take any boxing/MA film you like, Rocky, Karate Kid, etc., and imagine the final fight stretched to the length of 90 minutes, just that instead of physical skills, you watch people throw filthy language and pathetic tales at each other until your ears start bleeding and you can't stop your eyes from rolling. The only positive thing one could say about this movie is that none of the actors disappoints, they all play their parts brilliantly, first and foremost Alec Baldwin, who really nails the jerk part he's assigned to. Speaking of Alec Baldwin, his speech is usually the most praised aspect of fans of this piece, but honestly everybody who takes that speech serious should go see a shrink. If anybody finds this speech inspiring for motivating others they have no knowledge of the psychology of motivation at all, one could actually use it as a masterpiece example on how NOT to motivate people. Honestly, I don't have a clue why this film is rated so high, maybe it's a realistic picture of the corporate sales world, well, who cares, even if it should be, then the only thing I took with me is that salesmen are just an annoying bunch of dilapidated idiots and that I surely don't want to spend more time with them.",Glengarry Glen Ross
163,ericventura,"A Beautiful Film with Substance, But No Essence",9,4 July 2017,"Every aspect of this film should have received an award nomination. Every aspect of this film is done to a point. It's a play on the big screen, but it's an intense and introspective search of human desperation in an isolated incident, filmed so perfectly and naturally that the viewer can't doubt its realism. In the style of Arthur Miller, we have a story that may seem to desire the reform of the real estate industry, but that's absurd. It is an examination of the human reaction to having their back to the wall. Calm; negotiations; bribery; dirty deals; thievery; crime; and desperation.We have a film of immensely emotional and carefully constructed dialogue. Mamet builds the characters and feelings of the real estate agents through each line of dialogue. The screenplay dictates more a character study than a plot. The slow reveal of events only works to further characterize and emphasize personality.With such great characters in the film, they need great performances to make them come alive. Jack Lemmon leads the pack by far. Cheated out of a nomination, it feels like Lemmon is playing himself – a washed up character who once was the best. You can see the pain, the desperation, and the raw emotion on his face, but you can hear it in each line delivered. Lemmon leads the film and drives the character study, and he is the main subject. Al Pacino delivers a finely tuned and seasoned role that supports Lemmon' character through his downfall. Alec Baldwin punches out a brief performance with an intensity that the catalyst for the entire film needs. Alan Arkin is the pathetic one that was always pathetic. Arkin reads between the lines and conveys a convincing character. Ed Harris plays the character of rage and revenge, the one who has always been cheated, maybe an alcoholic – and Harris gets it right. Kevin Spacey, unfortunately, is dull and blah. His character is supposed to be a stone statue, but even a statue can have a fire in his eye.James Foley directs a monster of a cast through a delicate screenplay, turning in a beautiful film. The piece takes place in a naturally built production design, complete with a Chinese restaurant and a real estate office. But everything is buried too deep under the natural realism of the film. The emotions are perfect, but somewhat stale. It feels like a sweet glazed jelly donut without the jelly. There's a beautiful film that has substance, but no essence. Here, we have the 'Death of a Real Estate Agent', but just one notch below ""Death of a Salesman.""",Glengarry Glen Ross
164,yearspew,Some Of The Most Memorable Dialogue Ever.,10,21 June 2008,"If I were to roughly summarize Glengarry Glen Ross, I'd say it's a movie about a group of salesmen talking in an office for about an hour and forty minutes. Now, that's not far from the truth, but it's precisely in the talking where the beauty is.Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), Shelley ""The Machine"" Levene (Jack Lemmon), David Moss (Ed Harris), John Williamson (Kevin Spacey) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin) are characters brilliantly written and masterfully played. I have to include Blake (Alec Baldwin) whose only scene in the movie is one of the most memorable and many people's favorite. Oh, and James Lingk (Jonathan Pryce) who also has a small but equally masterfully played role.Every actor gives a stellar performance playing these salesmen. Just to watch them walk around the office and sitting at their desks talking to each other and yelling at each other is a pleasure. It's amazing how much entertainment can be achieved with just words and a regular setting like an office.The story is good, but I'm gonna be honest, this film is all about the characters.The dialogue is top notch. Some of the best dialogue I've heard in any movie. Absolutely quotable not only because of the way it's written (by David Mamet) but also because of the way the actors say it. If you want perfect delivery and timing, this is the movie.Glengarry Glen Ross is one of my top ten films of all time. A film with characters that make a day in the office seem like the most entertaining thing.",Glengarry Glen Ross
165,PrinceBuster5,Top Cast & Script Makes For A Remarkable Film...,9,27 September 2013,"...so here are my remarks, well-deserved & long overdue for this magnificent film. Too often film-makers blow their budgets on SFX then seem to penny pinch by employing students to write the script. Thankfully that is not the case here. It is based around the daily torments & dubious sales practices of a fictitious Real Estate sales company.This movie rests on the strength of its actors and the scripts crafted by excellent writers for their characters. With Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin & more there would be no excuse for turning out anything less than A class. I think it says a lot for the actors that they had the foresight to take roles in what must have at first look seemed like a low impact movie compared to much that is Hollywood.I loved Glengarry Glen Ross, even though at times it can be hard to watch because you empathise so strongly with the characters. It can make you squirm. As a former sometime Real Estate Agent here in Australia I'm glad to report that it in now way even slightly reflects the truth about most Real Estate Agents' techniques & ethics here. What it does do is dramatically show the tension of always being on the edge, of always needing the next sale to stay in the race. And it is a race. It isn't on Free-To-Air often even though here the strong language wouldn't cause any legal problems, unlike some other places. I strongly recommend it to pretty much anyone who considers themselves drawn to script based movies. 9/10 (PS: Why doesn't IMDb include Aust/UK/NZ etc spelling?)",Glengarry Glen Ross
166,jlangbert,Great Cast. Boring Movie.,3,29 August 2001,"GGR shows what happens when great actors are given a boring, long-winded script.  You get a boring, tedious movie.

167,RuthlessGoat,"Tremendous movie, Jack Lemmon is absolutely the best!",10,28 July 2004,"*I will try to avoid Spoilers, rent it!*There is no sexno violence.no CGI, car chases or exploding buildings. The only two women in the movie are seen for about ½ a second in a hat check room and putting two unappetizing donuts on a table, that's it. What the movie does have are half-dozen GREAT actors, working in perfect sync, and one of the greatest scripts ever written.Glengarry Glen Ross is about the stomach-churning world of hard sales, ruthless predators and their prey. This movie is about fear and survival on an almost primitive level and these actors deliver.boy do they deliver! This stable of actors portrays perfectly the cameo of the salesman with all of the associated despair, uncertainty and FEAR. For these salesmen, furnaces-stokers in a boiler room, when times are bad, they are very, very bad, and when times are good, they are not much better. 'What have you done for me lately' is the operative phrase delivered by the company lackey Sales Manager John Williamson, who is parenthetically verbally abused by all his salesmen. Jack Lemmon gives an all-world performance as an aging former top-performing salesman that has lost his edge and is rapidly burying himself in to the heap of has-beens. Ed Harris plays the very essence of a typical salesman, always bitching and never quite realizing his potential, mostly because of his own soured attitude. Alan Arkin as George is the most eviscerated salesman, having lost all of his confidence and the ability to close the deal. Finally, Al Pacino is the most successful and competent of the bunch, a swaggering bullshit machine that gives s the performance that should have won him the Oscar that year. The Salesmen are caught in a vicious Catch-22. The leads are tepid and stale and they cannot close them. Ironically, the often-dissed Sales Manager will not let loose of the Glengarry leads (genuine leads that they COULD close) until this rag-tag bunch demonstrates that then can close the unclosable ones. The anguish, anger and fear are ratcheted up a few notches by a ""motivational"" speech given by Blake (Alex Baldwin) at an impromptu Sales Meeting. Baldwin gives a brilliant performance and anyone who has been in Sales KNOWS and recognizes this type of speech. Motivation by extreme intimidation and threats, not unlike the ""motivational"" speech given by Gunnery Sgt. Hartman in Full Metal Jacket. Berating the Salesmen in the most inhuman fashion, Blake lowers the boom, telling them that the 1st price for the Sales Contest is a new Cadillac, 2nd prize is a cheap set of steak knives, and the 3rd prize? YOU'RE FIRED!Mamet is one of the finest writers of our time and the dialogue is crisp and filled with vitriol. The ""fuck you!""' is spat out vehemently and often as the Salesmen lash out at a situation that grows more and more intolerable. There is not much of a plot, but not much of one is needed, as the character development is intense and spellbinding. The dialogue is breathtaking as the men struggle for survival with animal like desperation and intensity, not unlike starving predators on the Serengeti Plain, looking for a kill. Shelly Levene's performance and plight are awesome and heartbreaking, as he will try any tact, legal, moral or otherwise, to make a sale. His Sales Manager is about as much help as a anvil in a life jacket, refusing to do anything to help his men do what they desperately need to do....Sell, Sell, Sell!The DVD set contains some great extras, including a wonderful 30-minute tribute to Jack Lemmon, one of the greatest of the greats.

170,jul-kinnear,Glengarry Glen Ross is based on David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning play about a group of struggling real estate salespeople who are under the gun.,8,29 November 2013,"Glengarry Glen Ross is based on David Mamet's Pulitzer Prize-winning play about a group of struggling real estate salespeople who are under the gun. They have to make significant headway closing sales on investment properties or be fired. The men scramble, and as time starts running out, they grow increasingly desperate, turning on each other and considering more drastic measures to break out of their situation.This is a movie about what happens to people trying to survive in a corporate environment that doesn't respect them or provide them opportunity to succeed. More specifically, it's about what happens to people — men in particular, here — in that situation. In other words, this movie is about angry, lying, arrogant, weak, small-minded people with loud voices that they use a lot with many, many swear words.True to its roots as a play, Glengarry Glen Ross is all talking. That might sound boring, but it's impossible to find lots of dialogue dull when it's written this well and delivered by a cast of Oscar winners or nominees — Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, and Alec Baldwin. This may be one of the best acting ensembles in a movie ever. The actors all give tour-de-force performances that leave you unable to look away. It's a reminder that energetic, action-packed dialogue can be just as thrilling as the most elaborate special effects.The actors let you, at various points, sympathize with the real estate characters, dislike them, or laugh at them. (This is in a lot of ways a very black comedy.) That's because the characters are always shifting, as are the power dynamics between them as they reach the end of their strings — with their company, with each other, and with themselves. And the result is that by the end of the film, you realize these are people you'd never want to meet in real life.In other words, none of these characters is a particularly nice representation of real estate people. That's partially the point of the film, but it'd be easy to imagine someone watching this movie and developing all sorts of bad impressions about the real estate business and its agents. They don't care about each other as a team, nor do the salespeople in Glengarry Glen Ross care about the people they're selling to. They aren't looking to help customers find their dream homes — they're just looking to meet their quota. They're interested in the money they get from people, not the people themselves. As Alec Baldwin says in his infamous, scorching monologue, their goal is simply to ""always be closing.""The men of Glengarry Glen Ross don't care about making a difference in someone's life. They only care about the difference peoples' money will make in their own lives.That's all not to say I don't recommend the film. Glengarry Glen Ross is a fantastic, thrilling film with breathtaking performance and great dialogue.http://juliekinnear.com/blogs/glengarry-glen-ross",Glengarry Glen Ross

And boy, was it a great surprise. The movie pulls you in, with smart dialogue and character development that happens while a lone man sits at a telephone, barely speaking. The plot gets going before you realize, going from an introduction to the characters to the main conflict of the movie smoothly, showing nuances of the same characters in a human and recurrent way.And then, it's over. It's not like it is a short movie: it's pretty standard feature length. But it pulls you in so strongly, it puts you in the shoes of desperate men in a way that makes the one and a half hour feel like a couple of minutes.

With such a talented cast of Alec Baldwin, Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin and Jonathan Pryce, it's no surprise that the acting really shines in this movie.  Equally wonderful is the plot: everyone vies against each other to sell the most real estate and whoever loses gets the unfortunate runner-up prize of being fired!  While technically not a comedy, it has some funny moments with Alec Baldwin verbally abusing everyone else in the office and Al Pacino telling off Kevin Spacey for ruining his real estate deal.  My only gripe with the movie is that it seems to end too early.  An epilogue would have been cool...""Glengarry Glen Ross"" has quite a bit of caustic language which may readily offend some people, but aside from that, this is clearly one of the best movies from the 90's!

174,MovieMan1975,One of top 100 greatest films of all time! and it's based on a play!,10,18 April 2005,"I cannot believe this film is rated below an 8What else can be written about James Foley's adaptation of David Mamet's Pulitzer prize winning play other than devastatingly scorching.Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin, Kevin Spacey, Alan Arkin, and Jonathan Pryce: perhaps the greatest acting ensemble ever put before a camera, collectively portray employees of a real estate agency- the sales department. Some of the greatest characters written in the 20th century cinema. Lemmon, 'the machine' Levene, is the old hero, now on a steady and sharp decline. Revered by others. Pacino,Ricky Roma the hot shot. He keeps an arm's length from everyone. Alan Arkin, George, is simply the loser. Never was hot, never will be - totally hopeless. Ed Harris is Dave Moss, a fighter, kinda like DeNiro in Raging Bull. Not hot, willing to do anything to reach the top. Like a rabid pitbull. Frustrated and at the boiling point. Kevin Spacey, Williamson, is the manager. A puppet of the owners, a real pencil pusher. But at least he doesn't live off of door-to-door sales. Alec Baldwin, in his greatest performance of his career, only taking up a mere 10 mins of screen time, tears the screen to shreds and burns the film up with one of the most incendiary, provocative, foul-mouthed, scene-chomping speeches ever. I was 17 when I saw this in the theatre and Alec Baldwin blew my mind with that scene. In college we used to watch this film over and over and rewind the speech 10 times over. We knew every line, every gesture. Jack Lemmon's face when Baldwin yells ""Put that coffee down! Coffee's for closers"". Or ""You see this watch? this watch costs more than your car"".We would kill ourselves laughing, that's how much we loved it.Mamet's character driven screenplay delves into the place in our souls and in our psyches, where desperation exits. The men live off of selling near useless Florida real estate, and their tool is the cold call - the hard sell. Lemmon, Pacino,and Bladwin are true masters. Gold belt senseis of the cold call. The bullcrap that they can unload is remarkable. Stream of consciousness. Lie upon lie. Smug and greasy. Pacino's monologue to the hapless gimmel Pryce, leads to tangents about pedophilia, and the stench of urine in subways. He wields a cheezy brochure of the properties like it's Shakespeare, with a picture of a fabergé egg on it. Lemmon meanwhile desperately stands in rain drenched phone booths, creating illusions to the listener like a verbal ballet. When he worms his way into one of the lead's house, he plants himself on the couch and grabs a stuffed animal he sees there. That little thing he does there, that gesture; in those 3 seconds, his character's conflict is symbolized. Though the guru to all younger than him, his decline is turning into an avalanche, ready to bury him. He is so desperate he resorts to the cheesiest, phoniest, approaches. It is heartbreaking to watch. Drama not unlike that of the great Greek tragedies of Aeschylus and Euripides. Classic human fare. Alan Arkin is slightly type-cast as the bumbling, mumbling, passive, loser. He has done it so many times. But this has to be the apex of that characterization for him. Ed Harris is so full rage, spitting venom (and literally spitting on Al Pacino during his farewell speech, his ""farewell to the troops""). It is literally one of the most expletive laden tirades ever projected in mainstream cinemas. You are just waiting for his ears to smoke and his head to explode. Gut wrenching. Williamson, is subject to, by Roma and Levene, the harshest tongue whippings ever. Ferocious, nasty, derogatory. Spacey is literally humiliated by these masters of bulls**t. He most certainly gets his comeuppance; and later, a pretty nasty little service return of his own. Much is written in these reviews about the swearing in the film. Swearing, in Mamet's works, is part of the syntax of those worlds. It is almost like the curse words become subtext. It is like the plié in his abusive ballet of words. But nonetheless, umbrage can be made about this matter. It is after all, foul swearing, carpet-bombed from a writer who uses it as his key verbal motif. You simply have to accept as Mamet's artistic license and move on. It is one of those things that you simply cannot let ruin the experience for you. Mamet is widely considered one of the greatest living playwright and screenwriter in the English language. Just consider the swearing as part of the stylization of the cold-caller salesman language.The narrative of Glengarry Glen Ross takes place in one evening and the next morning, and is mostly in a dingy office and a Chinese restaurant. Superbly light, and with an awesome jazz score, it has great camera moves that highlight, accent, punctuate, and round out the actors' performances. My favourite motif is the subway that rattles by - at crucial moments of crucial dialogues. It is interesting to note, that the director, James Foley, who superbly crafted this ensemble piece, never really became an A-list director. All the elements are there, perfectly and purposely assembled - the sound, the image, the performances. Perhaps, Mamet did more directing than the writer normally would? Or did the real cinema pros - the cast - just take the ball and run, literally directing the film themselves, so used to playing those roles on stage, with the exception of Pacino and Baldwin. Another note of interest, is that I have seen this film numerous times, with a variety of people, and have yet to meet a female who liked it. This seems to categorize Glengarry Glen Ross as perhaps one the more masculine, testosterone soaked, man-only films ever. Like wild male animals fighting it out in the jungles. Despite that, I say this is definitely a must see for guy and gal cinema lovers all over.",Glengarry Glen Ross

I cannot think of one other movie with better acting all around, or even better dialogue.  Even with a subject as drab as the life of real-estate salesmen, David Mamet injects it with an energy unrivaled in any of today's action movies.It also gives you a lot of food for thought.  Like 2001, if you sit and think about the character's motives, what their lives must be like, and so forth, you get a pretty complex puzzle.  Does Williamson really know what he was doing when he made up the story?  Could the check really be good?  Why did Williamson give Shelley a bad lead when he knew it was bad?  When did Shelly talk to Moss about the robbery?  How did Roma get the Jim Lingk lead?  What could Shelley have said to John to save himself?

178,rscafanever,Terrific play - on the screen,8,23 November 2016,"One can't escape the feeling that it's a play. Very little is invested in the setting - most of the film is in an office. But it stands in contrast with how much is invested in the acting.All the main actors are really salesmen - with their typical salesmen problems. And their annoying habits of bothering their victims as much as possible. As the story unfolds, characters evolve properly. Some don't.The dialogues are intense, as it is written for plays. The mind tricks the salesmen are pulling are just amazing and may be compared to scenes of other great movies like The Wolf of Wall Street.The little substance of the plot - the sales team of a real estate office is put under pressure, as someone robbed it - is not annoying by the drama added. You can just feel Jack Lemon's tiredness of years and years of finding victims.One thing was annoying: once you start to notice it's based on a play, you start to notice the limitations. Dialogues can be endless. There could have been more shots without dialogues. One knows that when one actor leaves the room, another is going to come in.But it's still a very entertaining film for an interesting evening.",Glengarry Glen Ross

Jack Lemmon, especially, stands out.  In addition, it creates a real atmosphere with the office and the constantly pouring rain.However, this is a film that has virtually no plot, a minimal story, and not much to make us care about any of the characters.  Alec Baldwin makes a drive-by appearance ... he's in and out in about three minutes.Overall, there's a lot to admire in terms of technical merit, but this is not a very enjoyable movie.",Glengarry Glen Ross
180,Walls Of Jericho,A gem every time I see it.,8,21 January 2001,"I just watched this again (probably the fifth time) and each time it gets better. This is truly what great acting will do. If there was ever a ""guy"" movie that had no shooting, explosions, exotic women, or car chases, then this is it because the tension is thick the whole way through. I think anyone studying to be an actor needs to look at this, and start rehearsing becase watching a movie like this should motivate any thespian. The scene with Alec Baldwin is the kind that will have you pumping your fist at just how tough he is. Pacino is great, with a delivery that is just masterful. Ed Harris as the high pressured guy about to snap, and Alan Arkin as the neurotic type who can't get a word in edgewise put in fine performances. And the desperation portrayed by Jack Lemmon as a the salesman who's seen his better days is the center of the film. Kevin Spacey also shows, in a low key way, where he was heading as an actor. The most amazing thing is that these guys practically say NOTHING. Words come out of their mouths that are strung together so haphazardly that any lesser actor would fail miserably. But these guys find it, go in the zone, and do it. Bravo!",Glengarry Glen Ross

But I want to comment onsomething that surprisingly has not been metioned yet and that isthe production design. I saw this movie for the first time in 2003. I know that it was madein 1992 but does it really take place in 1992? It's hard to tell. Itseems like the producers want us to think we're in the 30s or 40s,with the minimalist sets, the lighting, the music. The entireatmosphere. Even the opening titles. Is he purposefully drawing parallels between real estate in the1990s and earlier in the century? I guess even 1992 seems dated. Nowadays these salesmenwould have cell phones and internet connections.",Glengarry Glen Ross
182,busterbuff61,I'd go for the steak knives myself,10,10 January 2013,"The next time your best friend whines about his job, slap on a DVD of ""Glengarry Glen Ross."" Believe me, he'll shut up fast.The script's stage origins are obvious (David Mamet wrote the play and adapted it for the movie), but nobody will mistake this for just a photographed stage play. It involves some of the sorriest real-estate salesmen in Chicago, fully embodied by Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, and Kevin Spacey as the office manager. In a bravura opening sequence, Alec Baldwin, the downtown higher-up, brusquely issues the latest sales challenge for the month. First prize gets a Cadillac, second prize gets a set of steak knives, and third prize gets a pink slip.As if that wasn't incentive enough, the sales guys are given ""leads"" (potential customers to call) that are like ""I Love Lucy"" reruns: decades old, and seen a thousand times before. With this minimum of exposition, we watch the guys at what could be called work--their suit coats dripping with flop sweat, varying their phone calls between telling loved ones that they'll be late again and pursuing old leads to share a ""marvelous opportunity"" with them.Compounding the frustration are the ""good leads"" that Spacey keeps locked in his office, ""for the sellers."" Suddenly it dawns on a couple of the guys: What if the office was burglarized and the good leads stolen? Of course, the stupidity of this situation could be argued in a second: Wouldn't anyone who made a sale from the good leads be caught red-handed? But then again, the leads, like the MacGuffin in Hitchcock movies, are beside the point. It's really an excuse for David Mamet to throw a bunch of frantic old men together like cattle heading for slaughter, each not listening to the other guy, but waiting for that other guy to stop talking so that he can be heard. None of them exhibits the slightest joy in life. Even Spacey, the office manager with a loving family at home and an office full of great leads, can't even find it in himself to wallow in his superiority.As simplistic as the movie's set-up is, it's some kind of career high point for everyone involved. (My only warning is to watch out for this R-rated movie's generous use of the F-word--when asked, Baldwin even claims it's his first name.) ""Weepie"" movies come with the advice to have your handkerchiefs ready. Anyone who watches ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" should be prepared with a good stiff drink in front of him.",Glengarry Glen Ross
183,hrivnak,One of the best films ever,10,20 July 2004,"This is, without a doubt, one of my all-time favorite films. I defy you to find a better-written, better-acted film than this one.If you want an example of great dialogue, this is it. David Mamet is a master wordsmith and this is probably his greatest work. If one wants to study the art of dialogue, they should start with ""Glengarry Glen Ross.""On top of the great script, is great performances by some of the best actors. Jack Lemmon is outstanding as the salesman at the end of his rope. Al Pacino is masterful, as usual, in his role as the shrewd and cocky Ricky Roma. Alan Arkin... absolutely fantastic. Even Kevin Spacey, who wasn't a household name at the time, puts in a great performance, which is underrated do to the other stars. And Alec Baldwin really should have been nominated for an Oscar for his performance. It's just one scene, but it's one of the most spectacular acting performances ever put to film.Some people may complain that this is really just a play, caught on film, but director James Foley does an excellent job of giving us a sense of place and tone. There's a bit of noir influence in some of his scenes, and the film is directed economically, so it doesn't feel like ""just a play.""It's hard to believe that this film wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Al Pacino won an Academy Award that year, but it was for the wrong film (""Scent of a Woman""). Any one of these actors deserved it...",Glengarry Glen Ross

It reminded me a lot of Quentin Tarintino's writing. Although Tarintino does use violence, he also uses wonderful dialouge to get his point across, just as Mammet did.I don't think any other actors could've pulled off such great roles and I believe that these roles were created for Pacino, Lemon, and the others. This movie only takes place in limited settings, yet, due to the wonderful acting, I felt myself drawn into it so much, that I didn't even care that it took place mainly in the Real Estate Office.My favorite part of the whole movie though, and I don't think I'm alone here, is when Alec Baldwin gives his wonderful monolouge. It was so powerful that I felt myself afraid of this man.I give Glengarry Glen Ross a 10/10 and I recommend it to all people who love both Film and theater.",Glengarry Glen Ross
185,marcusq22,Some Glengarry viewing tips,7,18 July 2018,"Some tips for anyone who had difficulty with this film (from a guy who gained an appreciation for it after his first viewing):Don't go into it expecting a traditional three-act structure with rising/falling action and a resounding conclusion. This is more of a ""show about nothing"" a la Seinfeld (and even Catcher in the Rye). We're basically just following these quirky characters to see what crazy thing they'll do next.Another lens through which you can view this film: I suspect that Mamet penned this story as a form of therapy. It just seems ""too real"" to be pure fiction. I think it was cathartic for him to write it, and could potentially be therapeutic for anyone else who's had an awful, high-pressure, job.",Glengarry Glen Ross
186,etzool,A great movie for cynics.,9,26 February 2007,"I've been working in and around phone rooms for several years... if you have any sales experience, you will probably enjoy this movie.It's a cold-hearted, no-frills, no-excuses, and very accurate portrayal of an industry that shocked the hell out of me when I first got into it. This film shows you some of the darkly humorous parts of it: Representatives flat-out lying to customers to make sales, coworkers and management impersonating all sorts of company officials and high-rollers, leads being recycled ad nauseum... the list goes on.Perhaps the funniest part is that the whole premise of this movie -- the reps' utter obsession with leads -- is, unfortunately, the one people who haven't worked in the industry aren't going to fully grasp. It really... is... that... bad.One thing to watch for that's understated a bit is the whole idea of 'defection' from one office to another. They don't spend much time on it here, but it really does happen exactly the way it's described in the movie; I've seen it more than once.If you enjoy a lot of interesting dialogue, if you love to watch a really well-acted play, if you know how it is to work (REALLY work) in sales, or if you've ever been pitched by an overly enthusiastic telemarketer, you'll find something in this movie to enjoy.",Glengarry Glen Ross
187,leviot,Sensational acting but the plot leaves something to be desired,7,25 May 2006,"Anyone who has ever worked in a sales office, in particular a real estate sales office (as I have), we'll really appreciate this movie. The cut-throat competitive dog-eat-dog environment, the pompous slick-tongued swindling salespeople, the tense atmosphere, the wise-ass barbs being heaved back and forth.. it's all so over-the-top, but it's all so real. You can point to every single individual in this movie and say 'hey, I know I guy like that!'. From the smooth-talking salesman who would say anything to get a deal, to the once-successful burnt out guy trying to maintain his job and his sanity, to the inept no-so-bright kind who doesn't really belong in the business to begin with, to the goody-goody kiss-ass office manager, to the arrogant schmuck of a boss... it is all so perfectly placed.The acting in this film is right-on, not overacted and not underacted, and it has the feel of a real sales office, and how ugly things can get after something has gone awry. When everyone is trying to save their own skin, all of a sudden, old allegiances become murky, all the dirty laundry is aired, and people will say or do almost anything to get themselves out of trouble.But in the end, it is really the incredible performances of this star-studded cast that save this film, which has a great script but a very weak plot. This is very much a character-driven piece, with superb scenes created out of great dialouges and confrontations, skillfully acted out with subtle body language. This is definitely not an action-driven piece, and as mentioned, not much of a story per se. But the realistic and oh-so-ugly depiction of what happens to a business in which everyone's chasing the mighty buck with no concern for good-old fashioned ethics and loyalty, makes this movie quite a worthwhile piece of entertainment.",Glengarry Glen Ross

I think the atmosphere is well thought out and the character motivation works. All the pieces appear to come together in the plot...but... the fowl language is extreme.I do not object to the language because it is profane, but because it goes overboard. People under pressure do act irrationally and they do lash out, but this is extreme. I don't know of any work environment where people refer to each other as ""c***suckers"" either to each other's faces or with such frequency. No boss would tolerate his subordinates to talk him with such blatant disrespect. I also don't believe that level of cursing would occur because it is unprofessional. However, the company executive (Alec Baldwin) coming over and acting the way he did, that I believe.Mamet is an excellent playwright, but he goes overboard in this case. I still highly recommend this movie and the interesting human interactions that occur, but you should keep in mind that this is a bit extreme.

But if you like to watch a movies with mostly dialogue and some humour along the way, this might tickle your fancy.Since i don't work in the business field, or work at all, i was unsure of what the people in this business were trying to sell and why they were competing against each other. But i'm sure everyone else will. :) None the less, this all male cast movie was okay and i think the director did himself good by casting Al Pacino, because the first 20-30 mins of the movie wasn't so engaging and that's probably due to Al Pacino's absence, who comes into the movie around half an hour later.The non draining length, big actors and some memorable quotes, make this movie worth seeing once. 7/10.",Glengarry Glen Ross

You can select any one these actors -Spacey, Lemon, Baldwin, Pacino- and adulate over their intense performnaces. Any movie would be elevated by just one great performance, this one has four, plus, there's more. Alan Arkin, Johnathon Pryce, Ed Harris, they also bring in great performancesJack Lemmon's performance was nuanced, his voice and face portrayed the fear and sadness underneath a phony exterior, one of the greatest performances I've seen. A lot of actors have great performances based on intensity, but Lemmon here did it on a great range of emotions.The abuse and despair will turn off some people, but I think the story is relevant to everyone who feels the accumulated stresses of a tight work environment, and the sadness of having some career that somehow, before you could see it coming, becomes an abuse trap with no way out.",Glengarry Glen Ross
195,HAL9000-16,A cinematic masterpiece with the perfect cast,10,4 June 1999,"Glengarry Glen Ross has to have the greatest cast that I have ever seen in a film. Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Alec Baldwin, Kevin Spacey, and Jonathan Pryce all give brilliantly riveting performances. Seven of some of the greatest actors of our time.This film has some of the greatest acting I have ever seen, you'll swear you'ld think the characters are real if you didn't know any better. You can't pray for a better cast, or a better screenplay, based on David Mamet's own Pulitzer Prize winning Broadway stage play. Glengarry Glen Ross is also one of my top 20 favorite films of all time. I've seen this film numerous times and it never seems boring at all. This is certainly a film that deserved a lot of recognition at the Academy Awards, but like most of the other good films of the year, it didn't. This certainly deserved to be named the best film of 1992, it was so far superior to Unforgiven, and it mystifies me as to why this is not on the top films list.Another added bonus is a cool musical score by James Newton Howard. It seems to blend perfectly with the nighttime drama in the film. Wayne Shorter's sax solo during the credits is also a plus.Also, it is the little things in the film which make it all the more excellent, such as an el train roaring by each time one of the characters start to explode, the effect of the phone conversations which truly show the desperation of the men trying to improve their sales figures before they get bounced out of a job. After all of this praise, I won't go into the plot, but it is one of the most powerful screenplays that I have ever seen, which pits every man for himself against the harsh world of real estate. There is so much hatred and angst against the characters, which also contains excessive amounts of the f-word. This is probably why I love this film so much. To be honest, I would not have seen this film at all if it were not for its all star cast, but I'm certainly glad I did. I agree with most of you who said that all of the profanity made this film tough to watch, but each and every actor put so much life into their characters that it made me forget about that roughness and just enjoy this film.

196,haydendeepsy,Americans,9,16 March 2021,"When it comes to theatre scripts being adapted into movies, the one very hard thing to do for a director and a screenwriter, is finding a key point to the situation on which they can fix a sequence of shots. In the theatre, the setting includes the whole scene, with the keypoints all moving along simultaneously without needing to switch from one to the other. When it comes to a film, the director and screenwriter have to be able to reverse engineer the script, in order to find all the key points, give them the structure of sequential shots and edit them together in order to create the feel of the scene progressing. Very few have done it so brilliantly as Glengarry Glen Ross. Performances aside, the very best thing about the movie, for sure has to be the script. Entirely revolved around dialogue, it manages to suck in the audience and keeps them on point right untill the end. There is barely one moment throughout the movie where one can stop and collect one's thoughts.
The primary subject is the working class in a land ruled by capitalism, pushed to the bone and always sharp and focused when it comes to the job. What happens when they're backed into a corner? They have no choice but to fight in order to keep their job and sure as one can be they will fight, for no matter how much they argue and critique the capitalistic system, they are a product of it. And being a product of it, they have a sense of how to move in it and turn it's tables.
Just as the movie shows, friendships do not last long in such a society, for they are all dealt with in machiavellian fashion: if need be they are formed, but as soon as the task at hand is accomplished, they are erased before they can backfire. All that being said, Glengarry Glen Ross is a truly wonderful movie, not only is it gifted with wonderful performances, it works around the subject of the victims of capitalism, a subject not easily portrayable in a realistic and convincing fashion.",Glengarry Glen Ross

I place that in quotes because, since the picture was based of David Mamet's play, it is less of a 'film' than it is a play put on the big screen.  Where this picture excels is in its dialogue (the film is essentially, entirely dialogue) and its performances.  Al Pacino is charismatic and exciting.  Jack Lemmon is utterly wonderful, believably downbeat yet electrified and invigerated during his sales pitches.  Basically, every one of this picture's main characters is excellent.  The angry Ed Harris has a lot of power, Kevin Spacey is superb as the slimey, despised ""child"" boss with brains if not experience and Alan Alda is low-key and as skillful as ever.  The story is very small in terms of where it takes the viewer (quite literally the street, the office, a bar, a some doorsteps) but the broadness of the characters and the skill on show more than make the picture enjoyable.Its not action packed in the traditional sense, but watching such a fine cast work their magic is more than enough reason to watch it.8/10",Glengarry Glen Ross

As you may mix different aspects which are quiet different in value.The act is marvelous.It's beyond imagination. It's no surprise as there is half a dozen of the best actors in the last 20 years! All of the guys were legends before (Jack Lemmon), at the same time (Al Pacino)_ or a little bit later (Kevin Spacey). So it's no doubt full of energy and a masterpiece from acting point of view.The direction is unbelievably strong. Some ordinary subject, some losers and NO WOMAN!. And after all as it goes through you are tied to your chair harder. BUT....What's it all about? were's the moral? Isn't that necessary to obtain something from it? What you can obtain? That Jack Lemmon - the most positive character in all the movie - is the worst? That the cutest guy ( Al Pacino ) is a loser too? That Kevin Spacey is what ? Negative or positive? ANd after all .... so what?I do not think that putting the audience in some wrong idea and then give them a shock is always a good trick. You should think about the after wards and what will you give them after that...My best reason is IMDb itself. The movie which has about 7.2 points and many comments with 10 stars is not a favorite today (2007) at all!No one nowadays has heard about this movie and no one will.

Of course not. Is Alec Balwin typical of a main stream Vice President of Sales? No. My gosh, it would be near impossible to keep anyone of quality in such an environment.But what the movie does is make you appreciate what you have. Whenever the ""boss"" gets on your case about a bad sales month, think about Alec Baldwin and you will quickly realize he/she is not such an unreasonable boss after all.And when sales get tough, and they inevitably do from time to time, think about how tough they were for Jack Lemmon ALL the time: selling a bad product to unsuspecting people inside their home at 8pm. Ouch, talk about a tough way to make a buck.This movie keeps you grounded, that's for sure. But what I have noticed with this movie is non-salespeople typically cannot appreciate the film's greatness. They do not know the thrill of making a sale or the rejection one feels when they lose one, so they cannot relate. And that's fine, because unless you have been in the trenches, fighting it out against the competition, this movie probably cannot be comprehended.But for a sales veteran like myself, this movie is like an old friend.",Glengarry Glen Ross
204,wlandolfi-1,Very Thought Provoking Film,8,27 October 2005,"I recently took the time to watch GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS and remembered how when the movie came out in 1992, much was said about the constant profanity used in the film, especially the ""F"" word. I have read other sources and I would find it believable that in real life, people like the characters depicted would constantly be swearing. That aside, I found the movie to be very thought provoking as it basically shows what happens to people when they are desperate. For a little background, this film was originally a play by David Mamet and frankly, I essentially found this movie to be a play that was filmed. Also, this was an all-star cast with Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey and Alec Baldwin among others. For those readers who have not seen the film, the basic premise is that Alec Baldwin plays a hotshot in the company who tells all the workers that if they don't begin to close any new deals soon, they will be out of a job. For the most part, the office workers find the new leads to be worthless. Therefore, they become desperate and will do whatever they can to get ahead even if it means lie, cheat and steal. What impressed me about the film is how it showed that nobody cares how much experience one might have; all that matters is ""Can one get the results?"" To show an example of this, Jack Lemmon played Shelley ""The Machine"" Levine who was an experienced sales man and had gotten results in the past. However, it did not seem to matter since he did not seem to be getting the same results now. Also, the film showed other ""typical"" type of workers that people could relate to such as Al Pacino's Ricky Roma who was the hotshot in the office and felt he was the one to win all the rewards. To me, Ed Harris's character came across to me as someone who was not really a bad person but turned to less than honest means because he was desperate. Kevin Spacey's character (the office manager John Williams) seemed to me like the person trying to keep order in the office and did not have too much sympathy towards anyone. Alec Baldwin's role was very effective as the big shot who wanted to scare everyone. Just about anyone can say they have had an employer at one point or another who acted that way. In conclusion, I might suggest that the viewer might want to watch this film a second time because even though it is not very long, there is a lot that goes on. Personally, I felt the movie made more sense to me on my second viewing of it.",Glengarry Glen Ross
205,starzinhereyes7,A sleek business thriller,9,7 July 2010,"I was hesitant to see this film because I had read the play and did not see what all the fuss was about. You really do have to see it to understand why Glengarry Glen Ross is as gripping and tense as an excellent film noir. I could not take my eyes off the whole time, and could feel my high blood pressure after it ended. Do not be turned off by the idea that this is a movie about real-estate salesmen. It's about survival in the business world in general, and how its cutthroat nature drives men to deception. I had loved Oleanna's ability to hold an audience's attention with a dialogue-driven script, and this holds true for Glengarry Glen Ross. The performances are high-energy and suit the parts well, as expected from such a high-caliber group of actors, although some are better than others. Alec Baldwin, for example, steals the show and sets the tone in his brief appearance, whereas I found Kevin Spacey's performance a bit one-note. Still, each actor commands attention and gives a master class in monologue delivery.This is a captivating, satisfying thriller that, like a skilled salesman, knows how to hold your interest without overstaying its welcome.",Glengarry Glen Ross
206,pvsk,A great movie,9,17 February 2006,"I accidentally stumbled across this movie when I was channel surfing and I am glad I did that. Luckily the start cast caught my eye and I was able to catch the movie from the beginning. What a powerful movie. I consider a movie powerful when you don't stop thinking about the movie for a long time after you have seen the movie and it moves you in a certain way.This movie made me think about the ruthlessness of the corporate world where anything goes as long as you achieve. Though this movie concentrates on selling real estate, I hope some one makes a movie how only 'connections' not the real talent can advance you in the corporate world. It also proves how you should be conscience free and should forget about your family if you want to really grow. Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris , Alec Baldwin all give a very powerful performance as conscience free salesmen and motivators. Alec Baldwin provides a very powerful performance of a ruthless motivator. On one hand whether you feel sorry for the plight of these salesmen. I almost yelled ""common man quit the f***ing job"" to Ed Harris during Alec Baldwin's motivating speech. Sorry for the profanity but you automatically get into that kind of language as you watch this movie. This is another example how powerful this movie is. On the other hand you feel angry the way they cheat common men of their hard earned money.I completely agree with other members comment that this should be in one of the top 200 films. This film reminds me of 12 Angry me which was another master piece solely dependent upon powerful acting, script and dialog delivery. Jonathan Pryce has turned in a very subtle but excellent performance as a hapless common man who fall prey to these aggressive sellers.Overall a very great movie that you should not miss.",Glengarry Glen Ross
207,philip1123,"A true cult movie... Supreme acting, just perfect",9,2 April 2010,"""Glengarry Glenn Ross"" has to be one of the best independent projects I've ever seen (if not the best one). The plot is character based, and man, those characters, played by some of Hollywood's best actors, are fascinating. Al Pacino, Baldwin, Kevin Spacy and Jack Lemon just nail their parts, it's like they picked the perfect guys to play the perfect roles. Pacino is the charismatic, most successful real-estate salesman, who's had a good streak lately. Baldwin is the ruthless manager from the top office who comes for 10 minutes and attacks all the office staff in an offensive, yet very effective way. Jack Lemon is a veteran salesman, with his best days of sales behind him, desperate to make some very unlikely deals. And Kevin Spacey, well, he's just perfect as the indifferent, passive boss, who just doesn't care about anything but obeying orders from above. The story is not complicated, but it's very effective, and the supreme acting just blew me away. It's one of those rare films, that you'll remember for a long time. Some people complained about the use of profanity all throughout the film (a LOT of cursing), but I think that's what makes the scenes seem real - because the cursing, and harsh language emphasize the huge stress that all the salesmen are under 24/7.",Glengarry Glen Ross

Written and adapted from his Pulitzer Prize-winning play by David Mamet, which means the dialog is spicy, fast-paced and extremely profane. This film is an excellent character study on how the mind of a salesman works, and it is so true to life, its scary. Fantastic performances from the entire cast. Check out Kevin Spacey as the harried office manager who has to protect the good Glengarry leads, to Alec Baldwin as the sales manager from ""downtown"", who initiates a sales conference that is little more than an exercise in abuse. From Jack Lemmon as Shelley ""the machine"" Levene the old pro who's lost his stuff, to Al Pacino as Ricky Roma, the flavor of the month, who is well on his way to winning the Cadillac Eldorado.

Alec Baldwin fires in with a comical 10 min. speech at the beginning of the movie. ""Put that coffee down!!"". The look on Lemmon's face was priceless. Then there was the scene where Ed Harris threw a temper tantrum at Al Pacino. That's just built in comedy right there. He walked out the office yelling, ""f**k the lot of you, f**k you all. It was great. Spacey's character was a real a**hole. He had some great lines in there too. ""Will you go to lunch, go to lunch, WILL YOU GO TO LUNCH!!"" LOL, it was out of control. Finally, the dude that stole the show was Pacino. The scene where he tells off Spacey's character was the greatest scene in the movie. Everybody told off Spacey in that movie but Pacino walked away with it. ""You never open your mouth until you know what the shot is, YOU F****N' CHILD!"" or ""what you're hired for is to help us, not to F**K US UP!!"" That s**t was the craziest s**t in the world LOL LOL LOL. Pacino deserved that nomination that year along with Scent of a Woman.

I was also rather intrigued by the use of light in a couple of scenes. It often creates an unsettled atmosphere. The light and shadow often are in strong contrast, making the pictures artistically dramatic.

But even while the actors interact on screen, none of them steals the show. Talk about an ensemble working together. The confidence and chemistry from shot to shot will bring a smile to your face.The writing is fierce and fast. You want to see a movie where even curse words carry meaning? This is it. Alec Baldwin is in the film for maybe seven minutes, but the writing in those seven minutes chews up the set. On top of everything, the set makeup is amazing.

This, in my opinion, is the only way to adapt a stage play to a movie.The story itself is a very gritty and tense interplay between a group of real estate salesmen who have been given an order by their boss ""close a sale or your fired"" (played wonderfully by Alec Baldwin). What happens next is a study in the worst of human traits.As I stated initially, the great thing about this movie is the interplay between the characters.

The acting was not bad at all, it was good acting.  The story was not bad.  And the way the actors handled the story, was good.  Very good.  It is worth watching for that reason alone. The way in which the story was acted is the one thing that pushes me to grade this movie as better than ""not bad"".I didn't know who was cast in the movie when I sat down to watch it.  So as each new huge actor walked into the movie I was surprised, and amused.  It was as if they all got together to so some hard blue collar work.  I mean, like factory workers putting together a special team of the best in the union to do some solid production, these actors went to work and put out a quality product.  I don't know how long they worked on filming this movie, but I bet it was done quickly without any problems.

If there were a simple definition, then there would be a step-by-step formula to follow, and all movies would be great. Of course, they are not. But surely one commonality to all great movies is that we are able to forget that we are watching a movie at all. In Glengarry Glen Ross, we are able to do this very quickly. You are not watching some very big name actors playing pretend, reciting memorized lines from a script, taking direction from someone off screen. You are looking at and listening to road weary, flat footed, brow beaten salesmen. More than that even, you are living the life of a real-estate salesman with them. You're not in some crowded theater, staring up at a screen, your actually in that cramped little office, with a mean boss, a gnawing fear for the next dollar,and some intangible loneliness. Simple, subtle, superb, and sublime. After enjoying it once, watch it again just to see the master Jack Lemon putting on a clinic, and you'll see that Kevin Spacey was paying attention.

What I find most amazing (besides the acting, which is nearly flawless throughout) is how much of the dialogue is really trite and meaningless: cursing, shop-talk, complaining, boasting, avoiding the subject, and YET it is still so engrossing-- a testament to the talented actors who breathe life into it. Pacino's final scene with Pryce is perhaps my favorite-- he is desperately trying to keep Pryce on the hook, to the point of playing dumb, and makes Pryce's character look like an idiot.I find NONE of the characters at all admirable; they all have a layer of slime on them, even Lemon's Shel ""The Machine"" Levene, who has a certain humanity to him (desprately trying to help his sick daughter) becomes nothing more than a greasy salesman/con man once he picks up the phone (note how his tone of voice immediately changes-- no wonder people hate salesmen so much).My favorite line is one most people won't notice or remember (most people focus on Baldwin's haranguing or Pacino's curse-fest)-- towards the end, Arkin picks up the phone, mutter's ""God, I hate this job"" and dial's up a potential customer-- priceless, that says it all.""The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.""-- Thoreau (although in this case, they're not so quiet about it).",Glengarry Glen Ross

This movie is very highly recommended for any fan of great acting, writing, and movie-making.  When viewed as an allegory of modern times, this seemingly simple story is frightening in its implications of moral inversion and the spiritual death of the salesman.  But make no mistake; above all, Glengarry Glen Ross is consistently entertaining and brutally accurate, as those who have worked in sales will tell you.  See this movie right away.",Glengarry Glen Ross
225,magnoliaX82,Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) [Directed by James Foley],9,5 December 2002,"Sure, David Mamet's screen adaptation of his own Pulitzer-winning play is extremely well-written, but let's face it: Glengarry Glen Ross is nothing but a showcase for great performances. But then again, what's wrong with that? Especially when the performers involved are this talented (e.g. Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, and Jack Lemmon -- and yes, I did write Jack Lemmon twice). Afterall, there's nothing quite like watching Kevin Spacey ask Ed Harris to go to lunch... six times. In actuality, however, almost every single performance in this film -- INCLUDING Alec Baldwin, if you can believe it -- is Oscar-caliber. And at the end of the day, that's the only thing that makes it possible for such an ordinary concept to become such an extraordinary film. The story of Glengarry is rather bland: four real estate businessmen have to improve their sales or find a new job, and in order to accomplish this, one of them breaks into his office building and heists the ""golden leads"" his boss refuses to give out. Sure, there are a few surprising twists and turns, but the real treat of the movie is the chemistry between the characters. In an interview, director James Foley stated that when Alec Baldwin arrived on the set, the other lead actors treated him -- and I quote -- ""like s**t,"" making his performance (which basically consists of yelling at the four realtors and telling them to ""f**k off"") even more realistic. Al Pacino -- who earned the only Oscar nomination for the film -- is equally phenomenal, but as I hinted earlier, the true star here is Jack Lemmon (and I'm not just saying that because he's six feet under). Jack has always been one of my favorite actors, and to watch him play such a different role -- which would later be spoofed on The Simpsons as a down-on-his-luck businessman named Gil -- was a sheer treat. The other thing that I really loved about Glengarry was the mood: film-noir has always been my favorite genre, and it really takes over the first act of this film, made evident through the constant rain, the dark bars, and the desperate characters. Overall, Glengarry Glen Ross is a thoroughly satisfying drama worth being watched more than once.Grade: A",Glengarry Glen Ross

Unfortunately, all of them are under par in this movie and it's nobody's strongest performance by a long stretch. I think that it's the lack of quality in the script that lets them down.

A great cast like that deserves a lot better.Overall, it's a decent portrayal of what life is like for a real life sales team and their pressures to succeed.

Of course, anyone who has enjoyed films such as Dog Day Afternoon, Twelve Angry Men, or even Reservoir Dogs, will find this kind of play-based or resembling-to-a-play movie really entertaining, if not just plain brilliant. It's hard to understand why it's not sitting on the top with these other mentioned pictures. There's not a scene too long, there's not a scene too many. And it is believable.

As many comments on IMDb state this film is totally led by pacino & lemmon who literally sucked me into there characters lives as did the other supporting character such as the cold mr. Williamson (played by Kevin spacey).This film is the most memorable pacino film I've ever seen & is highly underrated.I believe pacino was in his prime at the time he was filming this movie (he had that rugged gangster look but with a profane youthful mouth to go with it!) as well as jack lemmon (R.I.P).I don't know what else to say but don't be fooled by the slow, dark pace of the early part of this movie, it is meant to be that way with events taking place over one night & one morning. You will love the transition of pacino one night,from philosophical smoothe talking salesmen to the ruff around the edges, frustrated comedic salesmen that he is in the reality of the film.A true mens film that has you watching it over and over again with friends.

Ya know, some movies can only be watched at night, say, on the weekends, and etc, but this puppy is good whenever you please.To make a good drama you NEED good actors and a perfect, and precise script which this movie had all of.

This, in spite of the solid story that provides a framework. This dark tale is sort of depressing if you're in sales! The performance of Jack Lemmon in this movie literally brings a tear to my eye. He was so incredible that I immediately started digging up and watching (or re-watching) every movie with him in it. What a genius he was.As for the others, there is no debate that this star-studded cast gave performances that would be expected of actors with their significant credentials. That said, I do part company with many of my fellow reviewers. Kevin Spacey and Ed Harris (and of course Jack Lemmon) were convincing in their roles, and their characters made sense. I did not feel the same about the others.One of my all-time favorites, Al Pacino, undoubtedly brought his own flavor to the Ricky Roma character, and it didn't work for me. He was simply too, well, ""weird"" in sort of a ""Scent of a Woman"" way, and his bizarre vocal inflections and body movements were an unwelcome distraction.Alan Arkin's character, George, (as opposed to his portrayal of it) was not believable. He came across as so dependent and mentally challenged that success in sales, or any field, would be unlikely and he would have starved to death long ago.Alec Baldwin is in the same boat, in that while he powerfully played a character that was already established in the writing and the play, his character was not believable. I don't see how ""Mitch and Murray"" would have let their operation get to the point it was and then send this pit bull in there. Or maybe, they were just bad enough managers to have done that, which I guess WOULD make sense. In any case, it is over the top. That said, it was very important to establish early in the story that one COULD be wildly successful in that business, so you would have a context for the other characters.Some have commented about the film's geographical setting, and it is ambiguous enough that it is almost distracting. People seem to believe that the setting was New York. After all, it was filmed there. I was certain that it was set in Chicago and that the outside shot with NYPD-colored police cars was an uncharacteristic affront to a viewer's intelligence. Not only does every city mentioned exist around the Chicago area (as well as NYC - with the exception of ""Batavia"" which is a suburb of Chicago but hundreds of miles from NYC), but I have a hard time believing that when people in NYC need to get away, they ""go to Wisconsin"", as Dave Moss said he was going to. I think that debate is settled right there. They were just too lazy to truck a few Chicago Police units to Brooklyn.",Glengarry Glen Ross
238,qahtanaj_85,realistically beautiful,10,29 December 2013,"I was captivated by the acting and script, so engaged that I lost track of time and when the movie ended I was like ""what? it just started"". anyone who worked as a salesman for a company or an office can relate to this story. the desperation to make a living, the strife to keep your job, the bloody competition are all part of your daily routine, and you have to get used to it and accept your destiny, otherwise don't bother going to work because you'll be replaced sooner than you think. I really liked Alec Baldwin's scene, it was the best in the movie. Not to mention Al Pacino's performance, everybody was real and convincing. if you appreciate real talent, it's a loss to miss such a performance. 10/10",Glengarry Glen Ross
239,thisyear-10904,Masterclass,10,1 February 2019,"An absolute masterclass in acting. Everyone is utterly brilliant. Obviously it's adapted from the play but the style doesn't try and pretend it's not. The camera just observes, like the audience in a theater, but that's not to say the film isn't cinematic. Beautifully lit and staged, with music that just sits nicely in the background lifting and dropping to push the story of these salesmen who live on a knife edge. They are all pretty selfish but each one has a motivation that feels very real and desperate. The only real villain of the piece is Alex Baldwin who is so amazing in just one scene.
If you love cinema and/or theater, let yourself become engrossed in some of the best dialogue you'll ever hear, from some of the finest character actors we'll ever see. Don't miss this film.",Glengarry Glen Ross

Not to be watched by people who are easily offended, because there is a lot of language.",Glengarry Glen Ross
241,shardik,Where's Jack Lemmon's Oscar?,10,28 February 1999,"Can't quite understand why Lemmon didn't get a nomination at the Oscars for his performance in this phenomenal but short film.  It relies on a superb script that makes something which we really couldn't be enthralled to see just by the circumstances the plot is immersed in (i mean, I wouldn't be that interested to see a movie on closers) but the actors pull us in, and the crafty script makes it just fantastic.  A great film, and if you ask me, Pacino could have done with his second Oscar of the year for his performance.Last but not least: Alec Baldwin's five minute performance is acting at it's VERY BEST.  That performance leaves an everlasting memory from the movie.",Glengarry Glen Ross
242,Vance-11,The ultimate ensemble of today's finest actors,10,21 September 1999,"When I ran into Al Pacino in the streets of New York the other day, and wanted to say something memorable to him, the first thing that came to mind was ""'Glengarry Glen Ross' is one of my favorite movies!"" (Later on I kicked myself for not praising a film closer to his heart, the outstanding documentary ""Looking for Richard"").Pacino is just one reason this film is among the best showcases of superior acting we have. It was Pacino who was nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar, but the most vibrantly desperate actor in this film full of end-of-their-rope flunkies is Jack Lemmon, never better than here, as a true Willy Loman type driven to contemplate serious crimes by his desire to move up the sales ladder at cost-cutting real estate brokerage. He must fend off Pacino, an intense Ed Harris and a cowering Alan Arkin. The winner gets a car, the runner up a set of steak knives. ""Third place is your fired,"" shouts Alec Baldwin, in his most intense screen performance, as part of a brilliant diatribe in which he eviscerates and emasculates the underachieving salesmen.Add Kevin Spacey and David Pryce to this marvelous cast, who get to speak some of the best lines David Mamet ever committed to paper, and you've got an intensely satisfying tour-de-force that's constantly riveting, despite the fact that the locale rarely shifts from the office and a nearby bar. Some movies written by Mamet are stultifying, since all the parts must perfectly blend for an audience to appreciate a filmed play. (""American Buffalo,"" despite the presence of Dustin Hoffman and Dennis Franz, is one of the worst sleep-inducers out there).But ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" is not for a moment dull, so colorful are the ideas of alienation and desperation, and so verdant is the dialogue, chock-full of perfectly intoned f-words. Baldwin's 15-minute monologue -- his only scene -- is the stand-out sequence, but Pacino also does a so-smooth-it's-chilling monologue with Pryce, the sweating potential customer wooed by Pacino's Ricky Roma, the current sales leader. Spacey, in one of his first prominent roles, plays a rule-enforcing office manager who absorbs insults like a battered sponge; Harris and Arkin sweat and kvetch aggressively and passively, respectively; and Lemmon is simply transcendent as he stammers toward his inevitable fate.The ensemble effect is simply smoldering. Go rent ""Glengarry Glen Ross.""",Glengarry Glen Ross

I'd never heard of the film, and very few have with its awkward title.  So my expectations were none-existent.  What I saw was 8 fantastic actors at their best.  Lemmon, is splendid and irritating as the out of luck salesman who cannot catch a break, Arkin, again out of luck, plays the nervous salesman who is easily lead by Harris' character, the angry salesman who thinks he deserves more.  Spacey, as the office boss is at his usual high standard as he refuses to cut his staff any slack.  Pacino, well what can be said about this man, his deliverance of lines makes any films he's in, addictive. Pryce, as Pacino's prey is also perfect.  And Baldwin, never has he been given the opportunity to express his talent in such a way.  His motivational speech is enthralling and proves just how good David Mamet is. Arguably one of the greatest scripts I've witnessed and proof that you dont need special FX to create a thoroughly entertaining hour and a half's worth of movie making!

The rapidly deteriorating world of Harry Stoner is turned, in a sense, inside out by Lemmon in this film.  Is Lemmon Glengarry Glen Ross's central actor? Perhaps not, but Lemmon's characterization of Shelley Levene is surely central to the film's power, terror, and madness.  Lemmon's Levene is a volcano pushing the other brilliant actors into some of their best performances.It is astonishing to me what Lemmon was able to draw out of Stoner and Levene turning, in his extraordinary talent, miserable, small men into lugubrious everymen which, at once, we justifiably revile and pity.  Harry Stoner, Shelley Levene, and Willy Loman, the ""other side"" of post-World War II striving.And, of course, every cycle of tragedy needs its comedy ... for me, in the Lemmon oeuvre, its ""Some Like it Hot.""  But then, ""nobody's perfect.""",Glengarry Glen Ross
245,tomdavie,Stress point.,10,31 March 2013,"This film based on a critically acclaimed play is one of the most real films I have ever seen. It shows the underbelly of who we are as people but do not want to admit. To see this film is to see the death of us all as we slowly degrade from smart ass young men into middle aged denial and finally , fossilized fools. Regardless of whether you are an actual 'used vacuum ' salesmen or we work in a hospital, we are all salespeople to someone and something. All of us play angles and shovel small talk each and every day. As we see the bull crap flying out of these guys mouths, we comfort ourselves that the vulgarity separates us from them and thus we aren't as bad as these guys. Its not about vulgarity or being a salesman. Its about stress. The film holds up a mirror of ourselves under enormous stress and we thank god we very rarely are. The plot in this script is the weakest part. Its too simplistic and shouldn't be able to carry an entire film. Its basically a bunch of guys in a lousy job whose life gets worse to the point of desperation. Each man deals with it in their own way. Just like each on of us deals with our own world , in our own version of heaven or hell, depending on how we view our lives.In this case, these men's lives are versions of hell. Each one is at loathe with themselves and therefore blames everyone and everything around them for their plight. One of them states he wont live in hell of earth, but even he disintegrates into a childish brat whose personal character is nothing like the image he tries to portray. The acting is the movie. It is unbelievably good. Both Alex Baldwin and Jack Lemmon give scenes that rival any they have had in their careers. Al Pacino has been so good in so many movies I cannot tell how good he was in this movie. He was good but by his standards I don't know. Alan Arkin drew the short straw when it came to casting. He had the part of a lovable loser who everyone likes but nobody respects. The most despicable character (besides Baldwin) belongs to Ed Harris. He is brilliant but a bit too loud as David Moss , who is ambitious , frustrated and fed up. But he is no fool. The lucky part goes to Kevin Spacey, who was jumping up and down with utter delight to be selected to be on the same screen as his hero Lemmon , and be considered at such a young age to be able to hold his own with some of the greatest character actors in Hollywood history. It must of rubbed off on young Spacey, as his mediocre performance in this film would springboard into academy award winning roles in several films after wards, making himself into an acting legend in his own right. Unlike most of Hollywood, this film has no hero, no real villain and no justice in the end. Its what we see every day. Ordinary people wishing they were somewhere else and someone else. Regular folks making bad decisions, and wallowing in the consequences. The movie left me feeling so much gratitude for the little integrity I was lucky enough to maintain in my own life.",Glengarry Glen Ross
246,mmagliaro,"Bare light on the worst of human amorality. Genius, and heart-wrenching",9,11 May 2011,"You've read the synopsis. Slippery salesmen in a real estate office use every half-truth, bait-and-switch, and outright lie at their disposal to dupe hapless customers into buying worthless real estate.Each character in the sales office, Pacino, Arkin, Lemmon, Spacey, all show us unbelievable lack of morality, each in a different way: Pacino with the impunity of Satan, Arkin with the desperation of Willie Loman, Lemmon with the glad-handed deceit of a used car salesman, and Spacey with the cold-blooded self-preservation of a rattlesnake.I don't see this story as one about the ""plight of the working man."" These working men are not likable, respectable, or hard-working. They are willing to trade lies for income. They are willing to destroy and hoodwink unsuspecting and even mentally ill customers out of their money just to make a commission. No, this is no sad story about working men down on their luck. These men made a career out of selling junk and stealing peoples' life savings. The acting is spectacular from everyone. You can see, indirectly from their remarks, gestures (and of course, story-telling) that they KNOW what they are. For some of them (like Pacino), they don't care. For others, like Arkin or Lemmon, they've somehow convinced themselves that it's okay, that the sale is all that matters.The language is harsh at times, but always completely believable and appropriate. I deeply respect the work of all these actors, and to put them together in one film created magic. They never ""compete"" with each other on screen. Rather, they augment each other. Arkin plays wonderful scenes crying on the shoulder of Lemmon. Lemmon plays great boastful scenes, crowing like a rooster about what he once was to Pacino, who kowtows to him, while you can see that he doesn't really care or believe him and is only thinking about who he can fleece next.It's bitter, it's human, it's believable, and it is a GREAT film.",Glengarry Glen Ross
247,xj220-2,Pacino and Baldwin shine,9,7 May 1999,"Very few movies can be seen over and over again even though it has a low budget, like reservoir dogs. Why? Because of the great dialogues. There are a lot of lines in this movie which are most memorable, most of them in a patronizing way (eg: 'Put that coffee down!! Coffee is for closers only.... your name is Levene?? And you call yourself a salesman you S.o.B.??'). This makes the movie more of a comedy than drama.In the opening scene Alec Baldwin makes clear that 'only one thing counts in this life: get them to sign their name on the line which is dotted!'. That is where this movie is about: closing (in a time of recession). Glengary glen ross makes you wonder whether a life as a salesman is a privilege or a disaster. Next to Alec Baldwin there are many famous actors playing an important role: Kevin Spacey, as an ass-kissing manager, Al Pacino as the salesman with the smooth-talk, Alec Baldwin as the harsh-super-salesman, and many more.The language which is used is very bad, therefore I would recommend this movie only to people who aren't offended easily.",Glengarry Glen Ross
248,Nordling,The best acting ensemble in recent memory,10,3 July 1999,"This is a film that challenges your beliefs in the working class system - the do or die spirit that this country has based itself on for many years. Al Pacino.  Kevin Spacey.  Ed Harris.  Alan Arkin.  Alec Baldwin. Jonathan Pryce.  What a great cast.  And Jack Lemmon proves why he truly is one of the Great Ones.Alec Baldwin has probably the best 4 minutes in his acting repertoire.  To me, Baldwin is a great character actor who needs to get himself some really challenging roles, and not try to be a movie star so much.  But lines like ""See this watch?  This watch cost more than your car!"" and ""Coffee's for closers only."" are given with malice and loathing.Al Pacino is terrific as usual, and Ed Harris takes griping to a new level. But Jack Lemmon's performance, as a man really on the end of his rope, is breathtaking.  This man should have gotten an Oscar for this, no doubt about it.  I'd like to think that Ving Rhames saw this movie just before he gave Mr. Lemmon that Golden Globe a year or so back.Finally, props have to be given to Kevin Spacey, who, like a spider, studies the web that is his office, looks for the first one to be trapped in it, and sucks them dry.

I mean, really, is that how a typical office functions from day to day? I mean, maybe you'd see a little bit of this with real estate sales men, but this was just ridiculous. I understand that if you make many movies too realistic they can get a little boring, but this was just way over the top. If they wanted to hire the best actors and get some amazing performances out of everyone, at least make it in a setting where screaming insults back and fourth and people freaking the h*ll out is a little more realistic.I also found it interesting that there isn't a female character in the entire movie except perhaps ""coat check girl"" who I saw listed in the credits. This was obviously intended to be a man's movie.The only good thing about this movie is how they portray salesmen trying to get deals, lying to their clients and acting very desperate, etc. If it weren't for the fact that I found this movie to be so mediocre, I probably would have enjoyed the actual plot a little more.

A movie if is it to be a good one must have a resolution immediately following the climax. GGGR does not, why? It would have been so fulfilling after sitting and enjoying a 100 minutes of heated emotional tension and end it without knowing what happens. It is another sign of ""Hey how do you end this?"" Well, you have Jack's character go to jail or cut a deal and you have the rest of the crew make some type of decision based on the robbery. It is not a good one but it is an ending.

Many of the leads rationed out by the office manager are impoverished individuals lacking either the money or the desire to actually invest in land.My synopsis; This is basically a movie about con artists in an exploitative consumer society. The reason it stands above the rest is the intricate language used by the characters. The stories they weave to make a sale. The hopes, ambitions and weaknesses thy prey upon.

255,redhawk-49394,Familiarity & Unfamiliarity in harmony,10,20 January 2017,"This film is undoubtedly one of my favourites of all time and that's because of it's brilliant portrayal of salesmen, it's stellar, sorry interstellar cast and its driving plot.One thing I really liked about this film (and it's Pulitzer prize winning source) is its 100 minute run-time. In that short 100 minutes, the film expressed to me more about the sales business did than Wall Street did in 126 minutes.Unfamiliarity - In this film, we're given an unfamiliar situation. There's no other film like this, so this is the first time we're actually being placed in this sort of situation. That's what gets us intrigued.Familiarity - Majority of the film takes place in one room. That gives us familiarity in terms of setting. We feel like home in that room, in a sense that we know how the characters move inside. The same is with 12 Angry Men and Reservoir Dogs. If unfamiliarity got us started, familiarity keeps us going.Next, the performances. Can we change that Best Actor to Denzel Washington for Malcolm X and that Best Supporting Actor to Al Pacino for Glengarry Glen Ross? Al Pacino is fantastic in this film. Kevin Spacey's performance makes you sympathise with him and hate him at the same time. Jack Lemmon makes you love him. Alan Arkin and Ed Harris are equally great. Alec Baldwin really has ""brass balls"".On a last note, I cannot talk about this film without commenting on it's fantastic editing. The editing is just marvellous.

261,nin_fragile14,"An excellent, complex, well-acted film",10,1 March 2005,"""Glengarry Glen Ross"" is writer David Mamet's masterpiece. In the 1992 classic, his rapid, incisive dialogue is quicker and more brutal than in every other movie he's done, and the characters, played by such people as Kevin Spacey, Al Pacino and Jack Lemmon, all exhibit a kind of rowdy vileness and vitriolic disposition that is appalling, engaging and astounding. Mamet's message is not just that real estate is a cutthroat business; the real focus of Mamet's screenplay, based on his 1984 Pulitzer Prize winning play, is the struggle between men--the need for a weak, hurting, woeful individual to lash out against those who prevent him from being better; and the need for those at the top of their game to slander those they know are starving.The movie's portrayal of a bummed real estate office down on their luck could be the portrayal of practically any tableau of unhappy, unruly men prepared to do anything to make a dollar. It's Mamet's characterizations--Al Pacino as Richard Roma, the slick, conniving, office leader; Jack Lemmon as Shelly ""the machine"" Levine, an old timer on a bad streak; Kevin Spacey as Williamson, the boss, a man who garners no respect from those below him; and Ed Harris and Alan Arkin as frustrated salesmen at the end of their wits--that makes the movie so important, so timeless. These are men of character who possess a twisted uniqueness, but also possess a common connection to all working people; they're fed up with work, with bosses, the unknowns, the pay, the long hours. They go through their routine gripped by spite and depression, confusion and anger, aware of how terrible their lives are, but too entrenched in their career to do anything about it. They're a part of the American dream but at the bottom rung of the ladder. They're living as capitalist independents but are no more satisfied with their work in the 20th century as a man might have been one hundred years before. They wear nice suits and ties and shoes, and some of them drive nice cars, but none of that can erase feelings of hopelessness and subjugation. When an upper level real estate agent gives a pep talk to Jack Lemmon and his coworkers on a dreary rainy night, he doesn't try to lift their spirits; he motivates by poking fun, denouncing, condemning and harassing.To Mamet, the real estate business doesn't try to make a man feel better about himself; it's there to make a man feel worse--to feel brutalized, hopeless and frustrated. And even those who make it-like the rich real estate agent who verbally tears down all he thinks are less than him--even they don't have any real end in life; for at the top, men still care about possessions and power.It's as though business traps a man, telling him what is good and right in life while shutting him out of every potential alternative. And as we see Jack Lemmon and Ed Harris and Alan Arkin battle against the relentless tide of job fulfillment, we see they have no other desires; all they care about is finding leads, twisting people's arms, making a few dollars. They come to believe that selling real estate is the most important thing in life, paramount to everything else, and their blinded pursuit ruins them, making them slouch in their chairs, making their eyes big and puffy, making them attack other men--good men--who were probably different people before they started. The film is visceral, bewildering, and depressing, showing what life could be for those who can't break out of a rigid system, who can't break free from a lowly, unhappy, position in life. The delivery of Mamet's dialogue by the actors is superb, ranking among the best ensemble casts of the 1990s. There is hardly a movie that more accurately shows people struggling to stay afloat in their job, besieged by inequities, dislike, and disrespect.",Glengarry Glen Ross
262,smragan,A playwright's tour-de-force,10,27 December 2000,"Before it was a movie, Glengarry Glen Ross was a play.  Like the play, the movie uses only seven or eight different sets, and the dialogue from the movie is identical, as far as I can tell, to the dialogue from the play. So it's basically a play that's been filmed.  Glengarry Glen Ross is a stunning play, and I think it adapts in a fairly straightforward manner to be a stunning movie, but my own bias, as a writer, is toward those films that have strong dialogue and show a powerful use of language.  Those of the more conventional Hollywood ""show-me-don't-tell-me"" persuasion may find it somewhat tedious.  But those who have an ear for the spoken word would be hard-pressed to find a better-written movie with better actors turning in better performances.

265,phani-bezawada,David Mamet's movie all the way,8,21 November 2014,"Intense movie experience i've had after a long time. The movie is about the tough game of survival, in a hostile world of sales, targets, commissions & leads. As can be expected by the fact that it is an adaption from a David Mamet's play, of the same name, the movie's main asset is its dialogue. And it seems it's one of the rare occasions when Movie is better than its source material. I am saying this because I found out that some of the most impressive scenes were added later for the screenplay. Besides the dialogues, the movie is also about characters. Among the impressive cast that includes the likes of Al Pacino, Kevin Spacy, Jonathan Pryce & Ed Harris, the surprising winner is Jack Lemmon. He plays his character to perfection. He lets the pathos of it to shine subtly through his performance. & About direction, the perceptive Roger Ebert made a wonderful observation that seemed to me very true in hindsight: 'The film was directed by James Foley (""At Close Range""), whose timing and camera help underline the humor; a line of dialogue will end with a reaction shot that mirrors our own reaction - surprised, blind-sided, maybe a little stunned, but entertained by the zing of anger and ego in the words.'",Glengarry Glen Ross
266,ainfozino,A picture is worth a thousand words; this film deserves every one!,10,15 August 2011,"Welcome to the wonderful world of real estate, where the golden rule is ""A.B.C., Always Be Closing (Glengarry Glen Ross)."" This means lie, cheat, steal and do whatever it takes to ""get them to sign on the line which is dotted (Glengarry Glen Ross)."" A highly competitive group of real estate salesmen struggle to close deals in a tough market with weak leads. In an effort to motivate the team, corporate bigwigs raise the stakes of the monthly sales contest. Blake (Alec Baldwin), the corporate henchman on a mission to enforce the rules, announces the prize: ""First prize is a Cadillac Eldorado. Second prize is a set of steak knives. Third prize is you're fired (Glengarry Glen Ross)."" The intense ultimatum is music to the ears of Ricky Roma (Al Pacino) who is the office superstar. However, rivalries erupt under pressure and the office becomes a breeding ground of anxiety, tension and desperation. Shelly Levine (Jack Lemon) clings to his faded glory while the other agents, Dave Moss (Ed Harris) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin) concoct a profitable scheme to get them back on their feet. When John Williamson (Kevin Spacey), the snide office manager, announces the good leads were taken during a robbery, everyone is a suspect.Glengarry Glen Ross is a splendid film adaptation of David Mamet's 1984 Broadway play, directed by James Foley. This is an exceptionally well-written script with a phenomenal cast that transforms material, which is not inherently cinematic, into an interesting and intriguing film. The film does not rely on special effects to hold the attention of the audience; it achieves this with a natural dialogue that realistically portrays multi-dimensional characters. The characters are complicated with a mix of good and bad in each of them. They banter back and forth, interrupt each other and at times it's hard to tell who's right and who's wrong. These conversations add interest and enhance the reality of the film.Glengarry Glen Ross is not what anyone would consider a feel-good movie, but there is appeal in the testosterone driven behavior of these characters that use memorable lines like razor ribbon to cut each other down. I find it interesting that some have claimed Glengarry Glen Ross is about the ""evils of the free-enterprise system."" I feel it is more about basic human evolution and survival of the fittest in a cut-throat world. This is evident in the fact that Ricky evolves to be the top-dog and consequently leads his mentor, Shelly, into proverbial extinction. They are all like animals struggling to survive in their environment.David Mamet contributes greatly to the film's success with an exquisite script. However, the attention to detail within the set design is noteworthy because it adds irony and reality to the film. A majority of the film is set within the walls of a drab, depressing office which is filled with inspirational wall hangings containing messages that seem to daunt more than inspire. Additionally, a picture of Shelly Levine's daughter sits on his desk in serene contrast to the all-male cast and surrounding chaos. The irony continues throughout the film and enhances the empathic feeling at the end.Although some feel the performances of Al Pacino and Jack Lemmon stand out among the cast of equals, I disagree. I feel each performance stands out individually without overshadowing the other and allows us to view into each of the character's psyche. Some characters have more time on screen and are more likable than others which may influence opinions. Oddly enough my favorite character is Blake. Blake does not appear in the play, but was added by David Mamet in the film adaptation. He is a heartless narcissist who takes great pleasure in his nefarious behavior and even goes so far as to show everyone his ""brass balls"". Even though Blake is a man I love to hate, he has some of the most memorable lines in the movie which I have been quoting for years. As I reach for a cup of coffee, I can hear Blake's voice saying: ""Coffee is for closers (Glengarry Glen Ross)."" The collaborative effort of David Mamet and James Foley produced a film which successfully transitioned a theatrical performance to the screen without losing any of its integrity. The effective use of close-ups keeps the focus on the dialog which is the quintessential element of the film's success.Glengarry Glen Ross. Dir. James Foley. Perf.

267,bladerunna1,One of Jack Lemmons greatest moments,9,15 March 2006,I have watched this film in excess of 30 times and I never tire over the citrus sharp dialogue and clever interplay between so many accomplished actors in one room. However Jack Lemmons' performance was totally underplayed by the critics. It is he and not Al Pacino who should have been nominated for an Oscar.Pacino's role was competent but did not come anywhere near that of Jack Lemmon. It makes you wonder if you are indeed watching the same film. Alec Baldwins six minutes was very slick but any actor would love that script as it just required the actor to turn up and deliver it. A wonderful film that will last far longer than the film that won the Oscar for best film that year. What was it....?,Glengarry Glen Ross
268,aml60,The Best Cast in any Movie!,9,15 September 2005,"Glengary GlenRoss is a truly great film. It show's the life of the real-estate salesmen. It is the only movie I have ever seen that has such a great cast. Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Kevin Spacey, Alic Bawldwin, and Ed Harris! All of them gave awesome performances.One of my favorite things about this movie is the great dialog that the writer put into it. Pacino had some of the best lines in the whole movie! Jack Lemmon was really good in the movie too. Although Alic Bawldwin was in the movie for only about 15 minuets, he was still great. This movie was originally based on David Mamets play, and they did a great job of turing it into a movie.",Glengarry Glen Ross
269,hassdossa,This movie came to life!,9,15 August 2007,"Absolutely ASTOUNDING!!! This motion picture is just Unfreakinbelievable!One of the most powerful, gripping, knock-out movies you will ever see, GuARantEED!I mean even from the first scene, it presents itself so true, real and raw that you'll get completely pulled in and stuck!And the characters, OH MY GOD, where do I start? Each one of them have been displayed so strong and believable that you won't believe that it's a movie. You'll think that this is who they really are and this is actually happening to them.It was so full-blown that I actually thought it was in 3-D for a minute! That's how hard they come at you!Hats off to Pacino, Lemmon, Harris, Baldwin and Spacey...they were TOO outstanding, none of them could've played their roles any better than they did!They only downside was, that I was having so much fun that I didn't want it to end.

270,gml17,The plight of the working man,10,26 March 2000,"No film that I have ever seen expresses the path that the working man follows better than this one. Lemmon and Arkin are perfect as the salesman who's luck has turned towards the negative. You can literally see their will to live being sucked out of them with every blown sale and missed opportunity. Ed Harris is great as the angry salesman who is willing to do what it takes to save his own future. Kevin Spacey plays the tight -collared boss to a T, pushing people and not giving them the breaks they need.  The two most quoted characters of any movie I know are those played by Pacino and Baldwin. Pacino always excels in parts where his anger and ability to create believable outbursts are showcased, as they are in this part. All that I can say about Baldwin is that this is definitely his best performance and the writing for his character is unbelievable. I can watch his 10 minute scene over and over again. This movie rules in every way possible. 10 out of 10.   (I don't give that rating easily)",Glengarry Glen Ross
271,Eddie Currie,A study of the personalities behind the suits.,9,12 May 2001,"That Glengarry Glen Ross is a profound (at times, profane) piece of work, is beyond doubt. This movie, based on David Mamet's celebrated play, follows the characters, through their daily grind of selling real estate, and pays witness to the fair and foul techniques, which, evolved through to the Eighties, previously the most fruitful techniques.The rhythm and atmosphere of the film, retains much of that of the play and our characters, for all their striking differences, are conjoined by the shared compulsion to ""make the deal"".This drive becomes incredibly exaggerated over the 18-or-so hours around which the plot revolves, as they have all been given a do-or-die ultimatum by their employer, with the top sellers being awarded the questionable prize of keeping their jobs.The harshness of this scenario and the way it draws the weaknesses and personality traits out of the respective combatants, demonstrates the futility and the tragedy of the working man betrayed. Its resonance is distinct and poignant to any individual, who has ever had their employment threatened.In true Darwinian style, the strong ultimately survive and the old and weak fall by the wayside, but not before we are offered a staggering insight into the selfish and uncaring cesspool that is the selling game.Quality of acting is undoubtedly the strongest element of the movie, with Lemmon, Pacino, Spacey, Harris and Arkin all at, or near, their best. The intensity they generate is remarkable.",Glengarry Glen Ross
272,rajk06,Needs more action,6,6 August 2006,"This movie is good, but could be much much much better. THe cast is excellent, and they all play their roles well. the plot however, leaves something to be desired. as an avid al pacino fan, i readily watched this film expecting the usual al pacino elements--drama peppered with some of pacino's amazing humor. however, there was very little drama and very little humor. the plot is too simple and at times the movie drags on. the writers should have added some action in the way of some violence, extortion, etc... after all this was in some ways a money laundering plot....however it lacked any elements that go along with money: violence and sex. in fact, there is no female character in the whole film. the writers could have let the thief get away for a while, enjoy his spoils...and then finally let him get caught. all in all, the movie is well acted but definitely in my opinion, incomplete.",Glengarry Glen Ross

I never found him funny, and while his performances in ""save the Tiger"" and ""Days of Wine and Roses"" were good, they weren't stunning to me.This film, though, is priceless. Lemmon is fantastic, and perfect.This is an actor's and a writer's film: Mamet's writing style is so relentlessly, intensely, searing it inevitably gets tagged as ""perfectly realistic,"" but it is so much more than that; the casting is indescribably on target. This is truly one of those films that one cannot imagine being remade with any success because it is hard to imagine finding actor's more perfectly suited to the roles, who more perfectly understand both their own characters and Mamet's unique rhythms, and who click so precisely.So, even if you've never liked Lemmon much, or you've found Pacino over-the-top, Ed Harris dull or Alan Arkin annoying, see this movie, because you will take away a profound respect for their talents.",Glengarry Glen Ross

275,Phil_N_Stine,Give me my god damn leads.,6,5 April 2009,"I really want to count how many times ""leads"" is said in this mothaf0cking film. They used ""f-ck"" 138 times, and I wouldn't be surprised if leads is in the same sort of bracket. Funny thing to open a review with, sure, but they used some words a hell of a lot. The dialogue is really fantastic though, and the repetition of some words just seems to add to that. Of course they keep ranting about ""leads"" -- their entire lives are defined by the damn things. The acting is also really good, and I'm disappointed Baldwin only had one scene (which was by far my favorite one). All in all, it really got under the skin of the problems faced by these salesmen, from a useless and annoying boss to customers who just aren't interested. The desperation caused by threats of job losses is really sold here, which is a really relevant theme at the moment (and probably always is). It wasn't really perfect for me though... I sometimes got annoyed with how a character would go from a huge loudmouth to mute, almost as if they were waiting for the next (admittedly entertaining) rant to reach its climax. It also had a plot twist I didn't see coming, which was nice.My rating for it may actually go up an entire point at some point, depending on if I ever get the notion to rewatch it. Right now, I don't think I'd want to see it again outside of the Baldwin scene.",Glengarry Glen Ross

You see, the two are essentially the same, only the film has one extra character (Alec Baldwin's 'Blake')and a few extra scenes; however, I believe that the film is superior to the play (which the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1984) in several regards.The scene with Baldwin (in his best performance) truly adds a great deal of weight and importance to the drama these men are facing, where their jobs are all on the line.  Plus, the music really adds to the lightning fast pace already created by the dialogue.  The direction is tight; the acting is incredible; the script is first-rate.There are, on the other hand, people who would not enjoy this movie.  It's extremely masculine and extremely profane (females are generally regarded as ""broads"" or other such derogatory terms, and over 130 f-words are spoken). If this sounds like it wouldn't be your cup of tea, look elsewhere.As I've said before, though, this movie's real power is in the dialogue and in the acting.  Pacino is at his brash best, Lemmon plays a horrible man yet does so with a twinge of sympathy, Harris gives one of his best performances to date, as does Baldwin, and Kevin Spacey shows us shades of the future with one of his first appearances in film.  My favorite character, though, is definitely the one portrayed by Alan Arkin.  I've never cared much for his work before, but this is absolutely brilliant.So stop reading this.  Go rent the movie.",Glengarry Glen Ross

280,jeremiahclayton-1,Quality Film..,10,6 November 2004,I have a tattoo of the business man on the high wire.. so I obviously love this film. People can hate this film.. but to me.. it's acting 101. Jack Lemmon himself had said it was the greatest cast he had worked with in his career.. which for those of you who don't know.. was legendary. The screenplay for the film is as good.. if not better.. than the script for the pulitzer prize winning play. Alec Baldwin's performance is some of the finest cinema of the 20th century.. and c'mon.. you and I both know Alec Baldwin is an average actor.. at best. So I think it's speaks volumes for Foley and Mamet's meticulous attention to direction and screen writing respectively. There will always be people who don't like this film.. but it happens.

There are some wonderful lines that ring true, and everyone is good at the way they chew scenery as their characters, but it's stressful to watch and ultimately tiresome and unsatisfying. The denouement is predictable and unbelievable; would police detectives really investigate such a trivial theft to such a degree?? No, they wouldn't. It's just another plot device to try to ratchet up the heat, and frankly, I prefer air-conditioning. There are some genuine belly laughs only because everyone has known salesmen who are exactly like these stereotypes, and anyone who has worked in a sales office will find the people and situations in this movie to be perfectly realistic.

284,wobboh,Glengarry Glen Ross takes a trip down Devils Garden Road,10,22 August 2005,"I watched this movie while on a sales road trip. From the opening of the movie, where the salespeople complain bitterly about the poor quality of the leads, to the sales manager from ""downtown"" tearing apart the losers on the team, this movie was my life for five long years.Glengarry Glen Ross was a worthless collection of real estate, but no matter what you sell, you come across the same types of salespeople.. the burned out old-timers like Jack Lemmon, the can-do-no-wrong hotshots like Al Pacino, the terminal complainers like Alan Arkin, and the constant cheaters like Ed Harris.Shortly after I attended an awards weekend for the top 5% of salespeople in my region (I was a hotshot and had the brass balls to go with it), I saw Glengarry Glen Ross at a matinée between sales meetings. The movie, combined with recently closing a prospect who lived on a street named ""Devils Garden Road"" (I am not making this up!), convinced me I was through with the amoral, stretching the truth life of the salesman.You can see the loss of the soul in the characters in this movie. The business of sales will eventually destroy your soul, just as it did to Willy Loman or Shelly ""The Machine"" Levine. You have to choose between success and your soul if you go into sales.Having said all that, Alec Baldwin's 10 minute masterpiece of a sales motivation speech is the epitome of what sales is all about. ""Put the coffee down..coffee is for closers..."" A MASTERPIECE performance. Coffee IS only for closers, and 3rd place-you're fired is the American Way. Produce or get out.

287,Mr_Royalewithcheese,Lemmon and Pacino make this movie a classic,10,28 January 2006,"At first, I was hesitant to buy this movie, but I always heard good things about it, so I bought it. At first, it's confusing for some minutes until you figure out the real estate lingo, but once you get past the ordinary phrases used by the businessmen, you love it. Basically the movie takes place in a real estate company on its last leg. During the night, someone breaks into the building to steal the Glengarry Leads. The good leads.Lemmon as Shelly gives an emotional and stirring performance. His facial expressions and his movements add to the whole effect of his character and it showed he could still act in major motion pictures.Arkin as George may have the hardest character to play as he plays a shaky and often on-his-toes salesmen, a good performance.Harris as Moss gets to do most of the screaming in the movie and that's always easy for Harris, he always does a good job.Baldwin as Blake has a short scene but makes an impact and it lasts. You just listen and stay attentive when Baldwin is speaking. It's that good.Spacey as Williamson has to play an embarrassed and often ridiculed office manager but Spacey's performances are always electric.Finally, the Oscar nominated performance of Al Pacino as Ricky Roma is quite possibly my favorite movie character ever. Pacino's usual swagger is there but this time it's there with an attitude. His screen impact is matched by no one in this movie and you'll love this character. With the exception of possibly Serpico, this is Pacino's best performance of his career and should've won the Oscar and probably would've if he didn't win for Best Actor that year.If you don't mind STRONG language and you love pure acting and dialouge and possibly the greatest cast ever assembled, you'll love this movie. If you like explosions every 10 minutes, leave this one on the shelf at the store. I give my recommendation to anyone who likes Lemmon, Pacino or just fantastic acting in general.

295,astewartm,I was bored out of my mind,1,12 September 2020,I hear so much about this movie but I was bored out of my freakin' mind. I almost slipped into a coma and had to fast forward through the whole second half. It was a waste of time I'll never get back.,Glengarry Glen Ross
296,peter-vidlicka,"Didn't enjoy it, don't believe the hype",4,15 June 2010,"After seeing glowing reviews and being referenced in the Boiler Room I decided to see this movie. I didn't enjoy the experience, which makes me wish I saw the play instead.Overall, the movie was balancing on the borderline of boredom the whole time. The plot (if there is one to be found) is rather difficult to follow, as everything is scripted into the dialog, which itself is unbelievably repetitive (""we can't work with these leads,"" ""yes we can't,"" ""we need the good leads"" and again again). I even resorted to read a wikipedia transcript of the plot in order to see whether I was missing something.-MINOR SPOILERS- Actually, the movie felt like it was deliberately made with the intent to throw the viewer into the movie and expect him/her to pick up details from the dialog. I appreciate the fact that it is based on a Broadway play, but as a movie, some background to the characters and main plot points would have made it easier to digest. For instance, how was I supposed to know the property they were selling was worthless? I wasn't mentioned anywhere, so how was I supposed to feel sympathetic to the buyers? No, I don't need a narrator to walk me through the problem holding my hand, no just one line somewhere would have done the trick.Also, I didn't understand the hostility of the salesman towards their branch manager. If they were such good salesmen, and hated their branch/manager/product/leads so much, why didn't they just pack their stuff and move on to another company? Their constant nagging and complaining made up 80% of the screen time.On the upside, the acting was really good and intense, and as a result it represents three out of my four stars. Check it out, if you feel like watching a handful of angry men argue for two hours, you won't miss out much if you don't.",Glengarry Glen Ross
297,dirkdigglerr,Shoot me please,2,15 January 2002,"This is a horrible movie. This is what happens when you act and direct like it's a play, but film it. It's a waist of the medium of film. It was painfully annoying and boring to watch and I won't stand for it.",Glengarry Glen Ross
298,knowcare,"""you never open your mouth 'till you know what the shot is""",10,28 December 2010,"This movie is so spectacular! i am speechless, i wouldn't know where to start if i wanted to praise it. Every single actor in this movie is amazing (and you can see what great titans we're talking about: Lemon, Pacino, Spacey, Harris). This masterpiece is not about sales, it's about the big players, the big game, about guts and maximum intelligence. This is what should be used for teaching in drama classes, this is pure art, real class and exquisite talent. If you watch closely you can see a hundred emotions per minute displayed on Lemon or Pacino's faces; you can do that just by observing their body language. Glengarry Glen Ross is my favorite movie right now and nobody should delay watching it, i mean nobody.",Glengarry Glen Ross
299,esscoss,This is what it is really about,10,7 October 2010,"Yes, this is a great film and dialogue and character development is superb but the reason this film works and is so memorable is because it explores human frailties so well. Everybody in this film is a 'good' person just doing their utmost to make a living and provide for their family and the film is about how business in general and their jobs in particular turn them into self absorbed odious social lepers no one would wish to spend more than five seconds with without running like hell or wrapping a big heavy piece of wood round their head.This film could have been made, and probably was, for no reason other than to show how, if we're not careful, we can be both lovable and truly despicable at the same time. For different reasons we are drawn to these characters and we like some more than others - we admire them, hate them and feel sorry for them in equal measure.A pseudo film reviewer (that'll be me then) might say this film shows 'black and white' to be varying shades of grey so subtly that most viewers get it (deep down) without realising it. Masterpiece.Budding film makers should watch films like this at least once every 22 seconds.",Glengarry Glen Ross
300,lilpinkypops,You arnt a salesperson until you watch this,10,2 June 2008,"This is a drama from an award winning play which was then made into a movie. Think about how much pressure the actors were under to go beyond the 5 star reviews and precedents already set by the play. Somehow and someway they had to find a way to go beyond excellence and make a movie out of this thing. That they did, and it is so well done that you will find yourself in shock.Now one may think, well you can edit a movie and re shoot all these scenes and splice sentences together to achieve perfection. And to a degree this is done, but NEVER did this movie leave its roots behind as a play. most scenes are shot all at once without stops or gaps (read up on the movie)... and perhaps if one were to compile the most brilliant moments of movie history you would find the speech that Alex Baldwin made in this movie which is like 10 minutes long as Alex Baldwin takes the stage and tears everybody else into shreds (I think thats why Pachino was gone from that scene because Pachino's character would have tried to take the stage from alex baldwin-- think about it.) I am a salesperson a lot of my friends are salespeople and entrepreneurs. In my social network if you cant hold your own in a face to face then you don't eat. time and time again I've watched this movie with my co-workers during lunch and not only does it tend to pump us up, but we quote this movie all day long to each other.""Put..the coffee down!

301,jesperhgh,How a play should be adapted to the silver screen,10,11 August 2006,"This is how a play could (should) be adapted to film: Excellent: Very few scenes, intense and brilliant acting, a meaningful dialog - yes, this could be dramatized for radio (come on BBC7) and be just as exciting as the film version.The film version is so intensively exciting mainly because it's a damn good story, and because of the brilliant cast.The style of this film - the few scenes, tender cutting, and thus the theater-feeling - makes me think of another masterpieces as Cat On A Hot Tin Roof. This film also has the intensity of even the best of todays car-chase-all-the-time movies.To the viewers: See it! And to BBC: Dramatize it for radio!",Glengarry Glen Ross

It's not that it was a Mars and Venus thing, it was that I'm a salesman and she's a teacher. If you are in sales, you identify with every little thing that goes on, and understand the weight and emotion behind the dialogue. If you know what it is to only make money when you perform, you understand the desperation that drives the characters. If you aren't a part of that world, you probably won't enjoy the movie as much, and if you're like my wife, it might even irritate you a bit. So, it's kind of a niche-specific movie, but those who can identify with it will love it. Bottom line: A must see for anyone in sales!",Glengarry Glen Ross
304,adammlewis,Truly wonderful,10,13 August 2018,"Although this film is primarily set in just 2 locations, its an absolute belter. Superb performances from the best line-up of actors I've ever seen in one movie along with a compelling script. Alec Baldwin's speech is arguably the best thing I have ever witnessed on screen. If you like dialogue filled Tarantino scenes, check this film out asap!",Glengarry Glen Ross
305,devnull31,Glenboring Glen Dull,1,8 September 2005,"This unimaginative film is pointless, tedious, pretentious rubbish from start to finish. It has neither plot nor story and the characters are universally objectionable. Lacking any entertainment value, this depressing, predictable, pompous drivel, masquerading as serious social commentary, lacks any real depth or insight: its nauseating self-importance is just too much.So many whom I respect like this film that I've watched it through again just to satisfy myself that it really is every bit as much a depressing snore-fest as I first thought. Jack Lemmon hams it up with over-acting (""The leads! The leads!""), with Al Pacino bellowing along --- these are the performances considered award-worthy!What a load of crap.",Glengarry Glen Ross
306,Gooch-5,Glengarry sets the standard for dialogue,10,18 January 2000,"Glengarry Glen Ross is another example of David Mamet's brilliant writing. Although it is always difficult to translate work from the stage to the screen because of the limitations to creativity of a live environment, Glengarry Glen Ross does an excellent job of retaining the dialogue's intensity and the performances are terrific.  Alec Baldwin's turn is especially memorable and understated for him.  Pacino's overplayed bravado fits the part so well that Kevin Spacey went into a deep depression after the daily abuse dealt to him on the set by Pacino's Roma and Lemmon's Levine.  Full of quoteable dialogue, it is a must for any movie buff.  ""So what are you going to do about it.  What are you going to do about it . . . a**hole.""",Glengarry Glen Ross

308,diminuen,doesn't get any better than this...,10,17 September 1999,"Glengarry Glen Ross is an absolutely incredible film,  nothing about this film is bad, starting with the best title sequence since Carlito's Way, it is a tour de force for everyone concerned.Alec Baldwin has a searing four minute slot that seems to hang over the entire film (possibly the only man in the world who actually has a set of brass balls, even if he does keep them in his briefcase), Al Pacino is at his best, never overacting for a minute, and never giving the ott ""I am Al Pacino"" performance that he has a tendency to do. Jack Lemmon is also outstanding as the desperate, rundown Sheldon Levene.The supporting cast (if you can class Kevin Spacey and Ed Harris as supporting cast) never falter for a minute, giving a depth to the whole film that modern movies often miss. EVERY character in this movie is complete and you feel like you know them all by the end.However, the part that captured me most was the overall look of the film, almost entirely in strong blue and red lighting that changes and moves with the sound and rhythm of the passing trains that dominate many of the scenes.This is possibly my absolute favourite movie of all time, and one I come back to time and again.",Glengarry Glen Ross
309,OzBrutus,An intense drama,10,17 January 2000,"Going into my first viewing of this acclaimed film, I thought it had a number of things going for it. First the cast, and what a bloody good cast!! Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Lemmon, Spacey and a number of other familiar players. The director James Foley is also a talent, although he is better known now for such thrillers as 96's ""Fear"". And finally, Mamet's play, which I have not seen, is said to be pretty dam good.The first major obstacle that faces the audience is the type of film it ends up being. It is not really aimed at the teen or younger age group, as its a very ""talky"" film. There is no laughs or violence, just some great dialogue and tight direction.And as for the cast, this is where the movie excels. Pacino is overpowering as Ricky, Lemmon is so good as an annoying salesman, and Alec Baldwin in little more than a cameo role easily gives the film's best performance. All in all, a well acted suspenseful drama",Glengarry Glen Ross

This is the standard all movies should strive to reach. I remember thinking when I first saw this: These are all known actors except the one. Who is that guy playing the office manager?

It was so painful watching how these people interact and live - just too painful. Even the most cold-blooded operations person cannot help having a twinge of sympathy for the sales guy - and wonder why anybody would do that job.Although I have never worked in real estate, I knew every one of the actors in this movie. I work with them at some level every day of the week, and although I've been in the work force for over 30 years I could never understand what made the sales guy tick. This movie brought me into the minds of several sales persons, and I actually started understanding their motivations and frustrations.

I've never seen a more stellar cast and better performances in any movie. ""Put that coffee down!"" You'll find yourself saying this at every opportunity. Jack Lemmon's portrayal of a once mighty salesman whose best days are behind him is outstanding. Pacino's performance is second-to-none. All of the other characters will remind you of people you have worked with before. Every actor's performance in this movie is unforgettable. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie immediately.

Never before has suberb acting ever been showcased by this many great actors.  I don't think there is a particular standout.  Alec Baldwin surprised me with his over-the-top performance.  Jack Lemmon and Kevin Spacey show why they're both two-time Oscar winners.  And if the Academy didn't frown on an actor winning two Oscars in the same year, Pacino would of easily walked away with Best Supporting Actor for this movie.",Glengarry Glen Ross

Capitalism provides opportunities, but when taken too far, workers become victims of undue stress and abuse. And you feel that pressure when you watch. The characters' desperation is palpable throughout the film. You don't just watch it, you live it with them.The film's script provides a perfect setting for the actors to showcase their talents, and they certainly deliver.

David Mamet's dialouge is rich and real the brilliant work of a man who intimately knows both his subject matter and his craft. The mystery is not why this film is so highly rated by users of this forum but rather why its cumulative score is not approaching the Excellent mark of 10. Perhaps some mechanism could be established within this forum to test the intelligence quota and film knowledge of those providing ratings and comments and assign an appropriate weighting to the scores and comments provided.

There is heavy use of profanity and I think it is appropriate to convey the levels of pressure caused by disrespect.This movie gave me an opportunity to evaluate my own limits of tolerance for overbearing management. I thought this movie was great because the dialog was unpredictable, the characters were emotionally squeezed and I felt their pain. I really had a new appreciation for the life I was living. Nothing compares to the speech by Alec Baldwin. I would compare the drama and pain to Cuckoo's Nest and Reservoir Dogs. This is one of my top 10 dramas and I gave it a 9.",Glengarry Glen Ross

Jack Lemmon is possibly the best actor ever--ever. He has an everyman quality that makes him golden. His character, Shelley ""The Machine"" Lavine, is a modernday Willy Loman.

321,gtangjr,Why isn't this movie on DVD?!,10,6 September 2001,"No film that I have ever seen expresses the path that the working man follows better than this one. Lemmon and Arkin are perfect as the salesman who's luck has turned towards the negative. You can literally see their will to live being sucked out of them with every blown sale and missed opportunity. Ed Harris is great as the angry salesman who is willing to do what it takes to save his own future. Kevin Spacey plays the tight -collared boss to a T, pushing people and not giving them the breaks they need. The two most quoted characters of any movie I know are those played by Pacino and Baldwin. Pacino always excels in parts where his anger and ability to create believable outbursts are showcased, as they are in this part. All that I can say about Baldwin is that this is definitely his best performance and the writing for his character is unbelievable. I can watch his 10 minute scene over and over again. This movie rules in every way possible. 10 out of 10. (I don't give that rating easily)",Glengarry Glen Ross

Truly a film for ...""anyone who has ever worked for a living."" The sniping, schmoozing, back biting, fragile allegiances, determination to be the best over colleagues, vulgarity, desperation, etc. all finally made sense. A stunning film from start to finish, dredging up memories of your own working life. The characters might be composites of your own experiences. Perhaps one day you are Pacino,top of the world and flying high, the next day Lemmon, confused and failing, the next day Ed Harris, frustrated and raging at the world. Spacey is only doing his job, maybe that's why at times he comes across so fragile and weak.

The cast is just fantastic, and this is even more evident by the lack of special effects... Without these great actors, I believe the film would be just average...I will not repeat what the others have said, I only would like to disagree with some of the people above, on the issue of Spacey's performance:I am a big fan of Spacey, you have to see him in films like ""Negotiator"" or ""Usual suspects"". However, in this film, my impression is that his role is of secondary importance to the plot, and that might help explain why I was unimpressed by his performance. I'm not saying he didn't play his role well, just that his role didn't allow him to prove once again what a great actor he is...

With the most amazing cast one could ask for in a movie (no argument there), GGR simply can be considered one of the best movie out there for at least another few decades. It took me twice the running time to really catch on with the film's plot, I was watching it first time pretty ""absentminded-ly"" but it caught my attention half way through that I had decided to go back and watch again from the beginning. I have to say this is rare since usually by now I would have turned it off and left it somewhere in dirt and might or might not come back to give it another try ages later which lead us back to the point I am trying to make: it's really really good!!! And pay attention to Alec Baldwin damn he's hot as a J@ck@$$, I can't believe I missed it the first round. I am not an expert myself to write a full length review with all the fancy words but I highly recommend it to everybody to give it a try. This is one heck of a movie that doesn't require steamy cleavage or luxury cars and impressive explosions (yeah i'm talking' about u Mr. Bond) to create the WOW factor. It's one of those that you either love it or hate it (seeing it was rated below 8 probably helps proving my case), plus in my experience with friends of mine, it might be a bit too ""masculine"" for female audiences since I have not met one with the same gender that enjoys it but hey I am a girl and I LOVE IT.",Glengarry Glen Ross

Glengarry Glenross gives us a fundamental understanding and insight to where capitalist society has led the western world.The false ideology of material possessions as an escapist reality and money being the driver to all ends. The shallow soulless of the hard hitting boss, who's only concern is too squeeze every dollar possible from the employee's rip off sales, which struggle to make ends meet. This movie is brilliant and accurately depicts capitalism's cut throat - dog eat dog society at its very worst.And this naive faith requires necessary illusion, and emotionally potent oversimplifications, which are provided by the myth-maker to keep the ordinary person on course.",Glengarry Glen Ross

I especially like Alec Baldwin's motivational speaker/axeman role, which delivers the funniest lines in an otherwise sobersided but suspenseful movie.  The action is tight and moves along fluidly.  The direction, lighting, music, etc., etc. is top-notch.  Summary: the best film of the 1990s and the most underappreciated one of the modern era. Check it out if you have at least half a brain, a modicum of concentration, and can bear a movie without an explosion every other frame.  Recommended especially for those who get a buzz off performances that show their characters enduring intriguing but frightening psychological and moral dilemmas.",Glengarry Glen Ross

The only part of this I find remotely entertaining was the acting, which was good, unlike anything else in this movie. That's why I gave it a 2 instead of what it just about managed to avoid, a 1. Would this movie be anywhere if it did not include Al Pacino? I doubt it.The big investigation and mystery was 'Who broke into the the office', and 'Who stole the list of people who want to buy houses'... Can it get any more boring? I won't tell you who it was, but I really think jamming forks into your eyes would be a lot more interesting, but either would put you unconscious.Even The Simpsons made fun of it with Gill. I'm not sure if they think that the obsessive use of bad language adds to the excitement or suspense of it, but I really think that it doesn't. Al Pacino is a great actor... I mean Godfather II, Amazing... But he hit a low that I thought no one person could reach. Anyone involved with the making of this movie should be shot. I have never seen the play, so I will not comment on it, but it couldn't possibly be worse than the movie. So if you want to subject yourself to such torture, watch the unrated by me-play.It isn't the no.1 worst movie, let's leave that with Superman Returns. So instead of watching this, watch The Truman Show... That is the No.1 best movie, and is rated .1 out of 10 better than this terrible, dull movie which is rated completely wrong.

The tagline, ""A Story For Everyone Who Works For A Living"", is very apt.Al Pacino is at his very best delivering a true story on the part of a salesperson and so has Jack Lemmon and Kevin Spacey.Its engrossing and the viewer fails to get off the screen for even a single inch of time. It connects with every salesperson in a way that he knows best. Getting nominated for the Best Supporting Actor, Al Pacino has delivered with excellence. Direction is nicely achieved. Language is REAL throughout and represents the very same scenario which every salesperson finds in his everyday job floor.

I was gripped.This movie has no sex, no violence, no car chases, no action - but absolutely the most powerful acting I have ever seen.  Uncompromisingly realistic.Having said that, I can understand why so many people do NOT like it - you have to like dramas, and especially one centered so much around desparation and conflict, and NOT around action.  It is adapted from the stage play, and I appreciate the way in which it was shot, retaining so much of the raw appeal that can only be felt at the theatre, as opposed to the cinema.This movie is a veritable who's who of acting, with Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, Alec Baldwin, Alan Arkin, Jonathan Pryce - not to mention a then-relatively-unknwon Kevin Spacey.If you can appreciate powerful acting, films based on dialogue with few scene changes, and can withstand an absolute barrage of foul language (which I must add is perfectly suited to this film), then this movie will blow you away.",Glengarry Glen Ross

The set up is that it is an exploration of the machinations behind the scenes of a real estate sales firm.

And yet there was very little of that... Then came the *spoilers* robbery plot... a 10 minute discussion Moss and Aaronow, only to have Levine get in on it in the end, sure it was a nice little surprise, but where was the development of his character to that point? The phone calls, I guess, were supposed to accomplish that, and yet I had to watch it twice to figure out that his daughter was in the hospital and he needed money for something... that should have been more fleshed out. Then Moss's character, high impact from the start, stealing whatever scene he is in, and there's nothing with him...Lastly, was Roma... his deal with Lingk had everything, the intro, the sell, the gradual luring in of Lingk, Roma slowly attaching one claw after another onto Lingk until he falls hook line and sinker, only to have a crisis of conscience, which opens the door for Roma's double talking, lying, word-twisting, misdirection, sell his mother to avoid losing the sale situation, and what... it's crammed right into the middle of the police investigation sequence... It should have become the only thing going on on the screen, but no, it shared the screen with the po-po... and thus its impact was lost.All in all, it had a lot of potential. If they had opened up the film, explored Moss and Levine's characters more, and then put Roma's situation front and center when it was happening, the film could have been truly great... and yet it wasn't. Boiler Room, while about the same in quality, showcased the evilness of the sales industry much better. GGR had slightly better writing and performances, BR had better plot development.",Glengarry Glen Ross
335,JimFenner,Is this supposed to be drama?,3,3 April 2005,"I read about this movie on IMDb and persuaded my wife to watch it with me. Such GREAT actors - yes! And excellent acting - so true! But as mentioned by another reviewer, a great deal of gratuitous swearing. No matter, I would endure that to see the great drama portrayed by great actors.But as the play wore on, I lost any affection for the characters, largely because of their swearing. Only Kevin Spacey was 'nice' and went home to spend time with the family.Lo and behold, the climax and denouement arrive (don't blink, amidst all the shouting and swearing you might not notice it) and the whole issue turns on a fact blurted out during yet another tirade of swearing.Mr foul-mouth gets his come-uppance, Mr nice guy wins, and does it all without swearing or being nasty, and still gets to go home to his family.I'm all in approval of Nice Guys finishing first, but is that it???? Is that all David Mamet, the playwright, can make out of this????How much better is this than the old Western formula of Black Hat=Bad Guy, you always miss, White Hat=Good Guy, whose gun always hits the target and who always gets the girl? Not much better, for my money.To sum up, GREAT actors wasted on a dramatic yawn. Three out of ten.",Glengarry Glen Ross
336,nisbre-388-388361,Top actors in cheap and boring movie,2,13 January 2013,"Can't say awful if there are : Al, Jack, Ed , Alec ... Without these guys would be clear ZERO. Production and scenography are like in 40s or 50s. I have seen this movie because of 7,9 @ IMDb. Those are reviews for big names not for movie. Boring. Don't waste your time. If a movie had $2 millions in first week, But total gross is $10 million you can figure out what about is there. I am fan of Mr. Lemmon. So this one supposed to be last bigger movie before he became old and grumpy man. He had couple TV movies . Short Cuts is much better movie but Jack got smaller role. So again,don't waste your time with Glengery Glen Gross. Don't watch any other instead of this one . But if you like to see good actors and performance in bad movie than go ahead.",Glengarry Glen Ross
337,tammjam,A Must See for Every Sales Rep,10,24 June 2004,"This movie is a blast to watch if you are a sales rep and especially if you have an ""a-hole"" of a boss! My co-workers and I were presented this film years ago by our boss (he was a great manager to work for), during a sales meeting. We laughed so hard we nearly pee'd our pants! Now that was about 8 yrs ago and I still watch it often. As a matter of fact whenever we have friends or family in town visiting I always ask if they've seen the movie. Turns out whether they've watched it or not I always play the scene (Chapter 3 on DVD) where Alec Baldwin is addressing the reps. It's probably some of the best acting from some of the most prominent actors out there. I believe it will turn into one of those ""cult"" films with a huge following of people ""who can't get enough"" and ""those that get it"". I rate this movie high for the having the best one liners in movie history!",Glengarry Glen Ross
338,john-husson,Awful movie of an amazing play,2,22 September 2005,"I was completely underwhelmed and disappointed by this film version of one of the great plays of the last few decades. Two astonishingly bad directorial choices: Al Pacino's monologue (technically a dialogue with Jonathan Pryce) that caps Act I of the play, a piece of freeform jazz-like brilliance that wanders all over until circling back in for the kill - one of those pieces you read on paper and can't imagine how anyone could pull it off. Instead of letting Pacino's astonishing performance appear as one piece (as written) - the director chops it up, intercutting it with completely superfluous material from another scene. It's like listening to Coltrane's ""My Favorite Things"" in 52-second intervals intercut with 30-second snippets of beer commercials. I have been tempted too many times to get the DVD and recut the scene the way it should have appeared - one long incredible take.And speaking of one incredible take, the scene toward the end where Lemmon confesses...I'm sorry, but why in God's name does the director decide to dolly back, rather than in? The absolute dramatic climax of the piece, and rather than heightening the drama by pulling us in, he completely deflates it by pulling us away.The director has done a disservice to this great work. He should not be allowed to direct drama again.",Glengarry Glen Ross
339,justins08,Captivating,10,7 June 2021,"There are so many great actors in this film and they all do a fantastic job sucking you into their hectic, high-pressure sales world.I work with sales people ( In IT) and while we are not selling real estate, there are so many parallels from my day to day to this film. From the pressure, to the way one needs to manage their mouths around customers, this film nails it.Among all of the great actors in this film, Jack Lemmon stands out. He runs the full range of human emotions in this film and he is %100 believable. He is a legend.",Glengarry Glen Ross
340,az-jen,What is the draw to this movie?,1,13 November 2005,"Never have I been so bored watching a movie... I was ""this close"" to shutting it off but thought ""Something interesting has to happen soon; this movie is so highly rated."" So I trudged on, constantly checking the counter to see when this horrible thing would end.Jack Lemmon's character was whiny, imbecilic, annoying and definitely slap-worthy.DeNiro's character was pompous to the Nth degree; he's the type of person who would con your grandmother out of her life savings just so he could get a freaking car.Ed Harris's character was a complete idiot; I nearly fast forwarded through all of his lines... he just wouldn't SHUT UP. The more he talked, the more annoyed I got with him.Arkin's character was a doofus plain and simple. If he was any dumber, it would have been illegal.Kevin Spacey's character.... what a reprehensible idiot.The movie lacked direction; it just seemed like it was made up on the spot without any regard to a plot. All it was was a bunch of middle aged men cussing at each other and calling each other names. How utterly boring!!!!! What a waste of a Sunday afternoon.",Glengarry Glen Ross
341,ugurkasif,what a cast!,10,4 October 2006,"The film is one of the best drama I have ever seen. The sellers in the film are played so real that at the end you think that you have witnessed it. The film does not judge, does not support anyone. The script is not too original in the sense ""unguessable"" but somehow you feel ""never felt that way"" before. Alec Baldwin's performance is the best I have ever seen of his but think the best actor in the film shall be credited as Jack Lemmon. Those who remember Lemmon as a comedian type J. Lewis more serious MUST watch this film in order to establish him as a one of the greatest character players as well in their memories. And the film does not lack a ""greatest of all time "" category nominee ... Al Pacino. Ed Harris and Kevin Spacey also confirm their star status. If you are or are going to be a salesman please watch this film before you dedicate your whole life. The film can help some tough bosses be more merciful to their employees. This one-day snapshot is touchy, realistic and thrilling. Absolutely not to miss.",Glengarry Glen Ross
342,javarain,A Master Piece - Raw Talent,10,1 December 2013,"This movie is for the intellect, the intelligent movie watchers, driven by character and raw talent. No special effects, CGI or blow-ups. This is as natural as it ever gets.The dialogue and script is brilliant. The casts is seasoned and the flow is natural. I have seen this movie twice a day in the last week. I truly enjoyed movies with strong dialogue that leaves an opening for the viewers to inject their own views.One of the best movies I have seen in a long time and this kind of movie is very difficult to come by.Looking for the blue ray.",Glengarry Glen Ross
343,ericedge009,Sublime Movie,10,29 April 2005,"Superb movie. A cast of the finest in the biz doing what they do best. An in-your-face look into the life of a salesman. Terrific dialogue and flawless acting really make you feel as if you're in that shitty little office about to get sniped at for not closing. Al Pacino is a standout and Alec Baldwin's cameo crystallizes the hard-edge theme of the movie. Not for the faint of heart, and not for the timid. This movie is a must see for anyone who has ever thought they had a hard day at the office. Lessons to be learned are prevalent throughout. It's hard to say if another cast this brilliant will ever be assembled again, though I highly doubt it. You don't wanna see this movie? ""Fuck you! hit the bricks pal""",Glengarry Glen Ross
344,michaelfoster4,Pretentious and boring.,1,24 October 2005,"It seems incredible to me given the cast, that this film could be as dull as it actually was. The primary reason for this was the plot, namely there wasn't one. In the last twenty minutes you hear something about a robbery but believe me, by then you will probably just be so desperate for the film to end.I had heard so much about the 'incredible script' and 'brilliant acting'. Well I don't know about you, but I don't consider shouting every line for two hours great acting. While the script consisted of about a million swear words, and if you can discern anything else from it you're a genius. The only people who say this is a great film are those who aspire to sounding intelligent and being 'academic'. To those people I say just be honest and admit that this film is terrible. The director was clearly trying to be arty by not having a plot and hoping that everyone would just assume that they didn't get it if they disliked it, well judging by the amount of positive reviews here it worked. Take my advice, do not waste two hours of your life on this film, I did but you still have a chance to escape!",Glengarry Glen Ross
345,keyes-16879,Not Good,2,9 April 2015,"It's a movie starring a whole slew of great actors that include Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Kevin Spacey, and a small memorable bit by Alec Baldwin. All the actors have great performances tied very nicely into a terrible plot. I'm guessing it's for that reason that I've never heard much about this film. It goes to show that if you put together a bunch of great actors with a bad story, a good movie it does not make.My rating is 2 stars it would have been one had it not been for Alec Baldwins performance. He was very cool and funny. For that it gets an extra star.You may skip this next paragraph if you so choose. As it is meaningless =to my official review. Movies under five stars do not deserve ten lines but rules are rules.Nothing good happens in this movie and through out my life I've been accused of only liking films with happy endings. well, I'm sticking true to form for this one. This sure isn't a movie with an invalid Barbara Stanwyck.",Glengarry Glen Ross
346,diamondgurl,ONe of the Best Movies ever,10,18 July 2005,"There's no way to describe this work of art. If you never liked Alec Baldwin, this movie will change your mind. I feel it contains Al Pacinos best scene ever. ANyone who missed this one, who likes movies, has seriously missed out, as a matter of fact, I don't think you can call yourself a movie enthusiast if you've never seen it. David Mamet should have gotten an Oscar just for doing the damn thing. Period.A Masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Jack Lemmon Gives his all. Don't be looking for a real uplifter tho...From beginning to end, you'll not look away!",Glengarry Glen Ross
347,bmorrissey51,This movie got me through college,10,24 February 2006,"And we probably drove our Sales professor NUTS demanding to watch this film during class. Of course we were never able to, but that didn't stop us from quoting it incessantly. I have never seen a film in which the entire script is so incredibly 'quoteable'. This movie definitely deserves a spot on the IMDb top 250. There have been so many references to this film in popular culture, from movies like Boiler Room, and cartoons like the Simpsons, and songs from bands like the Bloodhound Gang. If you watch the special features, you will see college students trying to act out the role of Alec Baldwin, but of course they fail miserably. Nobody could have pulled that off like Baldwin did...But Pacino's performance this entire movie was just simply awesome. Besides Scent of a Woman, I don't think there is a finer performance by the greatest actor EVER, than Glengarry Glen Ross.",Glengarry Glen Ross
348,gareev-ilvir,Great acting,10,7 July 2017,"One of my favorite movies. Great cast and a great acting game. Al Pacino, even for the actor's work in the tape nominated for an Oscar, and Jack Lemmon was recognized as the best actor at the Venice Film Festival. It is important to note an interesting story. The film motivates you to act. The film makes you worry. For those who have a taste similar to mine, I recommend watching this movie 100%.",Glengarry Glen Ross
349,mastrbildr88,Can You Close Them?,10,17 November 2005,"The movie's tag line ""for people who work for a living"" is on target for this classic mega drama...which is over weighted with the best talent Hollywood had to offer in 1992. This is a movie that is a cult powerhouse. The cinema photography is as intriguing as the dialog. The lighting is a work of art.The addition of Alec Baldwin's character, which appears early in the movie, makes one wonder how the play worked without it. In a slightly more sophisticated and darker way this movie parallels ""Tin Men""; which is another great sales movie written in a comedic fashion. GGGR is not a comedy but I find it humorous looking at it from the standpoint of someone who has experienced the ma-no e ma-no bravado that exists in the ""real"" real estate world. The seriousness which these characters live and breath their appetite for a good lead is ironic because of its innate accuracy.Mamet hides the intertwining of the character's motives demanding one to watch the movie again and again to absorb the subtle layering of situations and motives which are revealed throughout the movie.If you have worked for a living, this movie will provide a solid bit of entertainment as well as thought provocation. The constant darkness and rain represent what happens when men find themselves past their prime yet still working in a young man's world of ""what have you done for me lately""; which challenges their morality beyond the level to which they already capitulated to years previous when they accepted the role of swamp peddlers.Don't miss this one, and be prepared to make your bladder go the distance...once this one gets started you won't want to leave the room for even the shortest of reliefs.A-Alway..B-Be...C-Closing...Always Be Closing",Glengarry Glen Ross
350,mjhmwils,Unremarkably compelling,8,10 February 2006,"I stumbled across this film some time ago, late one evening when it was shown on television. I read the synopsis in the TV guide, which eluded to a rather unremarkable story line. Anyway I thought I'd give it a go. Within minutes totally hooked. Such a basic story, but so well acted by a star studded cast, which include Pacino, Lemmon, Spacey, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Alec Baldwin. All turn in solid performances with Lemmon,in my opinion, giving one of his finest. If you like action movies,this ain't really the film for you. If you like actors who can act then this will be up your street. If you read the plot and didn't know any actors you probably wouldn't give this film a chance. It's quite amazing that so many big names did this film on what is really a soft plot. It's a great film, you gotta see it.",Glengarry Glen Ross
351,numbra,Allstar cast that swears like sailors,7,22 February 2006,"I've heard about this movie for years and then when I finally saw it.....disappointment. It's like a Quinten Tarantino film...without all the violence. I turned it off 3/4 of the way through it. Just came across as a fine cast with great performances by Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino and Kevin Spacey, but the language was just way too much and distracted too much from the story. An agency full of realtors that have to break all the rules to keep their jobs is a bad start as it is. I think it's dream of actors sometimes to find a roll where they can talk like sailors and get it out of their system. It's so melodramatic that it's not funny and you wonder just how much more vulgar these guys can get.",Glengarry Glen Ross
