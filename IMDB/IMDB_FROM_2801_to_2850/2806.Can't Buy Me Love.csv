0,SnoopyStyle,teen movie switch,5,8 April 2015,"Ronald Miller (Patrick Dempsey) is a nerdy kid. Cindy Mancini (Amanda Peterson) is the school queen bee cheerleader. Her mother would like her to go out with nice boys like the Miller lawnboy instead of her narcissistic football player boyfriend Bobby. Bobby is now in college and has left Cindy behind. She ruins her mom's jacket and needs to replace it. Ronald is tired of playing cards with his dorky friends. He sees a distraught Cindy at the mall. Instead of buying a telescope, he comes up with a scheme to become popular by pretending to date for one month. His little brother Chuckie (Seth Green) is suspicious.This one does a switch with the normal teen movie cliché and gives the guy an exterior makeover. I didn't see the appeal of Dempsey or his character back in the day. I guess many others saw the McDreamy hidden underneath. It still baffles me a little but at least he's a neurosurgeon on the TV show. The formula works to a limited extend. Amanda Peterson does well to transition from shallow queen bee into a deeper pool. She's a great 'Where are they now?' actress. It's also fun to see a young Seth Green. The climatic lunch encounter is way too earnest which this movie suffers from time to time. Ronald's (cool?) outfit is ridiculously hilarious. It could all work if I actually like Dempsey and his character.",Can't Buy Me Love
1,claudio_carvalho,The Price of Popularity,7,10 April 2019,"The geek Ronald Miller (Patrick Dempsey) lives with his parents and his younger brother in the suburb and works hard during his vacation mowing lawn for neighbors to save one-thousand dollars to buy a telescope. Ronald is part of an outcast group of nerds with his friend Kenneth Wurman (Courtney Gains) and has a crush on his neighbor, the popular cheerleader Cindy Mancini (Amanda Peterson). When the expensive coat of Cindy is damaged in a party, she goes to the store to propose a deal to the owner to buy another one. Ronald sees and offer one-thousand dollars to buy the coat for her provided she pretends to be his girlfriend for a month. Cindy accepts the deal and Ronald becomes a popular teenager at school. He changes his personality, leaves his nerd friends but four months later he leans the price he has to pay for his achievement.""Can't Buy Me Love"" is a sweet movie from the 80´s with funny moments and a good moral lesson. Ronald Miller learning how to dance in an African show and then repeating the movements in a party at school is maybe the funniest scene. The criticism to people that change the behavior to be popular is also great as well as those that follows these false leaders no matter how ridiculous they are. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Namorada de Aluguel"" (""Girlfriend for Rent"")",Can't Buy Me Love
2,gavin6942,Fun High School Comedy,6,10 January 2016,"A nerdy outcast (Patrick Dempsey) secretly pays the most popular girl in school (Amanda Peterson) one thousand dollars to be his girlfriend.At the time this film was made, I do not think anyone involved was terribly well-known. Seth Green was obviously too young to get noticed. Patrick Dempsey had more than ten years to go. And Courtney Gains, though a popular guy in horror circles, has never really made it big. Amanda Peterson is a mystery... she seems to have just stopped.The plot is fun and a bit predictable, but the predictable parts are what make it fun. Is this really how popularity works? I do not think so, but what do I know? I never understood it in high school and now twenty years later I still have not figured it out.",Can't Buy Me Love
3,BandSAboutMovies,Money and love,6,9 June 2021,"I cut grass from 15 to 25 years old and that's how I put myself through college and even made extra money once I started my advertising career. I certainly would not have used the money I made to save for a telescope or to date the popular girl in school like Ronald Miller (Patrick Dempsey).The girl next door of his dreams, cheerleader Cindy Mancini (Amanda Peterson, whose career and life didn't go as brightly as this movie would seem to make me think that it would), has wrecked her mother's new suede dress, so she agrees to be his girlfriend for a month for the sum of $1,000.This is the kind of movie that makes me hate the second act of the three-act structure. Ronald gets popular, gets rid of his old friends and even turns on Cindy. She thought they were in love and he probably did as well, but no one knows how to connect. He's already hanging out with her friends instead of Malachi and Seth Green, but isn't that the way these things always go.Director Steve Rash started his career making movies like The Buddy Holly Story and Under the Rainbow and now makes direct-to-video sequels to the American Pie, Road Trip and Bring It On films.So yeah. In the 80s, a tender romantic comedy about making young women into prostitutes was the kind of thing we saw as romance. Weird, huh?",Can't Buy Me Love
4,Coventry,High school sweethearts,7,24 October 2004,"Charming and cute 80's movie about a colorless high school nerd who desperately wants to get into the cool clique of jocks, quarterbacks and foxy cheerleaders. Ronnie Miller (Patrick Dempsey) pays the popular Cindy 1.000,00 $ to hang out with her for a month. And it works, too. Since the cherubic high school queen dates him, every other chick wants a piece of him too and every jock wants to booze with him. But, the cooler Ronnie becomes, the more he forgets about who his REAL friends are (the other nerds he plays poker with) and he even fails to notice that Cindy is developing honestly warm and romantic feelings for himawww! 'Can't Buy me Love' isn't exactly the type of high-school comedy that'll have you rolling over the floor with chuckles but it perfectly knows how to create the right, wit atmosphere. It seems like director Steve Rash knows damn well what lives inside the walls of an average co-ed high school and I'm sure every viewer will recognize the caste system from his/her own school. Dempsey acts well but is outshined by Amanda Peterson, and she even looks better. Keep an eye open for Seth Green as Dempsey's brat brother. Can't Buy me Love is a rather modest, but very enjoyable movie. A lot better than the nowadays take on high school humor, which only involves jokes about sex and faeces.",Can't Buy Me Love
5,hitchcockthelegend,"Whatever happens to your popularity, stay yourself, don't change to please others.",7,19 January 2019,"Can't Buy Me Love is directed by Steve Rash and written by Michael Swerdlick. It stars Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson. Music is by Robert Folk and cinematography by Peter Lyons Collister.Plot has Dempsey as nerdy outcast Ronald Miller, who fed up of not being popular pays Cindy Mancini (Peterson), the most popular girl in school, one thousand dollars to be his girlfriend.The 1980s was awash with films of this ilk, the teen dramedy topped up by a big hearted message and a finale of punch the air worth. What it all comes down to is if the film can hold its head above water, not become too twee, and crucially have you smiling come the finale. As evidenced by its popularity among 80s cineastes of a certain age, Can't Buy Me Love delivers all that you expect from such fare.The core theme is of course self acceptance, the attainment of such in amongst the scary world of teenage school years. This shines bright in spite of some rather unconvincing dialogue and contrived corny moments. Director Rash just about holds it together, ensuring that the charm of the lead actors holds weight for character engagement, even though for thematic depth the screenplay only skims over the surface.The teenage dramedy would evolve considerably once the 80s was left behind, becoming more biting, daring and observational. Yet for those who lived and loved this type of film in the 80s, there's a lovely nostalgic glow to be gleaned from revisits to the likes of Can't Buy Me Love. Nothing wrong with that. 6.5/10",Can't Buy Me Love
6,view_and_review,From Geek to Sheik,8,5 September 2019,"Money can't buy you love but it sure can buy some righteous popularity, and that's all Ronald (Patrick Dempsey) wanted. Or so he thought.Ronald was the prototypical nerd and he would give anything to be in the ""in"" crowd. So he gave $1000 to be exact. That was $1000 that he was going to use to buy himself a top of the line telescope, but instead he used it to buy Cindy (Amanda Peterson) a new suede outfit in exchange for her pretending to be dating him.You see, Cindy was the head cheerleader so her approval was a ticket to popularity. It all worked perfectly except that Cindy caught some feelings and Ronald became a grade A a-hole.This was a Trading Places type of movie in which Ronald literally purchased his ticket into acclaim. We got to see a social experiment playout with a touch of romance.Is it all bad to pay for popularity? People use their money for entrance into all kinds of exclusive clubs and places, so why not an exclusive group in high school? Sure, I know it can be seen as being shallow, but so be it. He had the cash she had the access, it was a wonderful trade.",Can't Buy Me Love
7,Uriah43,One of the Better 80's Teen Comedies,7,6 August 2015,"""Cindy Mancini"" (Amanda Peterson) is the head of the cheerleading squad and the most popular person in high school. ""Ronald Miller"" (Patrick Dempsey) is the head nerd and essentially avoided by everyone except his fellow geeks. One day in the local shopping mall he happens to observe Cindy in some emotional distress and goes over to see what is wrong. He then learns that one of the jocks at the school accidentally spilled red wine on a very valuable suede jacket she took from her mother's closet and she desperately needs $1000 dollars to replace it. Since she needs the money and he wants to feel what it's like to be popular in school he offers her the money he has saved mowing lawns in exchange for her being his girlfriend in public for a month. Unfortunately for them, neither of them realize the ramifications. Now, as far as this movie is concerned I will just say that that this is one of the better 80's teen comedies produced with both Amanda Peterson and Patrick Dempsey performing in an exceptional manner. One particular scene involving the ""African Anteater Dance"" was especially hilarious. In any case, I highly recommend this movie for those interested in a film of this type and rate it as above average.",Can't Buy Me Love
8,Wuchakk,"Fun, campy 80's teen flick, sometimes touching",7,10 February 2018,"RELEASED IN 1987 and directed by Steve Rash, ""Can't Buy Me Love"" is a high school dramedy about a geek at an Arizona high school (Patrick Dempsey) who pays the most popular girl in school (Amanda Peterson) $1000 to act like she likes him for a month so he can move up the social strata. Of course, this creates unforeseen problems. Courtney Gains plays his geek friend and Seth Green his little brother. This is better than some 80's teen flicks (e.g. Molly Ringwald's movies), but not as good as others (""Fast Times at Ridgemont High""). It's arguably on par with ""Just One of the Guys"" and ""Some Kind of Wonderful."" Unlike those films, however, it has a semi-campy vibe wherein the cast members often exaggerate their lines in an artificial way, which telegraphs that what's happening isn't real. If you can roll with this odd element, there's a lot of good in ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and the ending is genuinely moving. There are many serious/realistic scenes, like the notable airplane graveyard sequence. The two protagonists have good chemistry and their relationship arc is convincing. Tina Caspary (Barbara) and Darcy DeMoss (Patty) are serviceable on the fringe female front. THE FILM RUNS 1 hours & 34 minutes and was shot in Tucson, Arizona. WRITER: Michael Swerdlick. GRADE: B/B- (6.5/10)",Can't Buy Me Love
9,gridoon,"Overlong, predictable but enjoyable.",6,6 November 1999,"Even at 92 minutes, ""Can't Buy Me Love"" is slightly overlong. Its utter predictability makes most of the events in the last third seem inevitable and the film has no surprises in store for us. It's still quite enjoyable, though, and reasonably well-acted by the two leads who manage to make their stereotypical characters believable (the supporting characters remain stereotypical, though). Seth Green, who plays Dempsey's kid brother, has a hilarious, scene-stealing (if minor) role.",Can't Buy Me Love
10,Irishchatter,Good but some parts were a bit whiny...,8,13 November 2015,"Ladies, you will love Patrick Dempsey transforming from a nerd to a very naughty bad boy. That was my only favorite scene, it's like he is showing off his true colors! I thought the rest was alright but there weren't that great enough scene's.I think there was a lot of whining going on too that would definitely put you off regarding girls grouping over Ronald and the fact, Cindy had kept pressuring him on pointless things like breaking up in public which was fake. I say they copied Grease or any other Greaser films just so Patrick Dempsey looked good in this which he did but Rom Com is definitely not for him to act in!",Can't Buy Me Love

12,Captain_Couth,Revenge of the 80's: The white elephant movies.,5,1 July 2004,"Can't Buy Me Love a.k.a. Boy Rents Girl (1987) is one of my ""white elephant films"".  This is a movie that I would not have in my personal collection but whenever it's on T.V. I'll never miss it.  I don't know why I like some of these type of movies.  Maybe the theme of the movie is what interest me (more likely I watched it one day when I had nothing to do).  This was another Patrick Dempsey film that came out during the late 80's (who was pushing this guy in Hollywood?).
A gangly nerd who spends his spare time mowing lawns (he's saving up his money so he can buy a telescope) falls for a blonde girl.  One time whilst at the mall looking at the telescopes, he notices his dream girl is in trouble.  The dumb ditz ruined her mom's favorite outfit.  At the spur of the moment he makes her one of the strangest offers around.  What is it?  You'll have to find out!
Another totally 80's films.  The gaudy clothes, mullet mania and the bad dance music that came out during this time period (don't forget the womens poofy hair).  Hopefully none of these styles will ever come back into style again.  Strangely enough, this movie was remade recently.  I guess the film-makers can never get enough of this plot device.  If you love those pesky 80's movies, then this one has nor name on it!!!

13,ebiros2,Money Talks,7,22 September 2012,"Patrick Dempsey, and Amanda Petersen, what an iconic '80s casting.Teen oriented movies that started with ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" paved the way for whole slew of movies of this kind which this one now has a ""classic"" status.Now, girls are wishing there's someone who would take them on a lawn mower ride. That's become a romantic thing now - wow !Pretty cool movie that's fun to watch even now.Just because the casts are teenagers doesn't mean that the movie is a light weight.It seems like a dumb movie, but it's too good of a romance to be taken lightly.Older actors would have done it differently, but this is just as good as any love story.",Can't Buy Me Love

Also featured are Ricardo (Rico Ssssuave!), Courtney ""Malachai"" Gaines and several other familiarish faces.There's just enough here to merit a revisit if you're an 80s kid.

15,vertigo_14,The High School Caste System,8,25 April 2004,"Can't Buy Me Love is a sweet romantic comedy that's still great after all these years. What was the reason for making an exact replica of the film (Love Don't Cost A Thing) except geared for young black audiences? Why not just make an original romantic comedy altogether instead of trying to replicate this particular teen movie? I hate remakes.Can't Buy Me Love ridicules the high school caste system--that popular kids are the invincible social class that other social groups strive to be part of, but are limited by the ""understood"" rigid rules of their place among the social system.Ronald (Patrick Dempsey) is supposed to be the hopeless nerd. He's a quiet kid that flocks with loners (one of them being the cool Max Perlich). Ronald is in love with senior cheerleader, Cindy Mancini (Amanda Peterson). As the popular, rich cheerleader, she is definitely hands off for Ronald. Ronald wants the girl. He wants to be popular. Is it possible for the geek to transcend his expected role in the game of high school social groups? Definitely, but for Ronald, the consequences are disasturous and also conducive to helping Ronald straighten out his priorities of friendship, love, and the like. Is he willing to trade it all in for popularity and all the superficiality that comes with it?Ronald's opportunity arrives when Cindy stumbles into the mall one day looking to return or exchange her mother's outfit stained with wine thanks to Cindy, who wasn't supposed to be wearing it, anways. The price of a new outfit: $1,000. So, Ronald, who happens to have that cash since he was saving up for a telescope, makes Cindy an offer: to pretend to be his girlfriend for a month. Ronald expects that this will give him just the popularity he wants. To be a high school senior, friends with Cindy, and make the A List? For Ronald, that's all he wants.Cindy's grossed out by the idea at first, not wanting to be scene with Donald (as she constantly mistakens his name). But with the Mancini make over, Ronald's on his way to being the new stud on campus. One month later, Ronald is rubbing elbows with Cindy's senior friends, cheerleaders Barbara and Patti and and jocks Big John and Ricky. But, Ronald, in his transition, seemed to forgot that what he wanted all along was a date with Cindy Mancini, who's makeover has turned Ronald into some kind of monster. Ronald doesn't only push Cindy away, but also his closest friend, Kenneth (Courtney Gains) and the rest of his old crowd of friends who hate their friend's newfound social life. But, how far is Ronald willing to go? And how long can he live down the lie?It was one of three good movies Dempsey made in 1987, along with Loverboy and In the Mood (actually the latter is better than the former), all being cute romantic comedies. But I think Can't Buy Me Love will always be my favorite. Patrick Dempsey, Amanda Peterson, Seth Green (who plays Ronald's little brother, Chuckie), or hell, even Max Perlich fans, are certain to like this movie. It's got good style for the 80s too and hot teen cast. I still think it is one of the top 80s teen comedies.",Can't Buy Me Love
16,triple8,Surprisingly good and is much better then one might expect it to be.,8,1 December 2003,"It kind of reminded me of revenge of the nerds. I liked this cute little movie about a geeky boy who pays the hottest highschool cheerleader at his school to pose as his girlfriend. This is a fun movie and one that works surprisingly well. One of the better teen comedies from the 80's. Myabe not as popular as some others but just as good and somehow does not come across as ridiculous as so many similar movies of this time period did. It's a definite must see for anyone who appreciates a movie like ""Revenge of the nerds"" and hasn't got to see this yet. I really enjoyed it. Obviously the movie's not an Oscar winner or to highly original but it works and as teen movies go, it is toward the top of the heap.",Can't Buy Me Love
17,hnt_dnl,When McDreamy was a nerd,5,6 September 2020,"It's still hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that Patrick Dempsey in his arguable most popular role as the reserved, laid back, assured Dr. Derek ""McDreamy"" Shepherd from Grey's Anatomy used to actually play the role of the geek! lol Yes, way back in the 1980s (seems like a lifetime ago, which I guess it is), Dempsey regularly essayed the roles of awkward, frenetic, geeky nerds. The height of Dempsey's nerdom was in the 1987 to 1989 time period where he got to star in several serviceable comedies, including this one CAN'T BUY ME LOVE (1987). I recently re-watched this movie having not seen it in a very long time and one thing I forgot was how fast this movie moved. It really just goes from scene to scene not wasting much time. And despite being top heavy in terms of actors that carry the movie, namely Patrick Dempsey (as protagonist Ronald Miller), Amanda Peterson (as love interest Cindy Mancini) and Courtney Gains (as Ronald's best friend Kenneth Wurman), I really find the bulk of the supporting characters to be extremely shallow and forgettable. Contrast this to a film like the cult classic Three O'Clock High, which came out the
same year, and it's slew of memorable supporting and minor characters added on top of the two stellar main character performances. All the minor characters in this comedy piece felt like the same person.Another thing I realized upon re-watch is that the wardrobe department really went nuts trying to make Dempsey overly nerdy. I don't believe for a second that, even in the 80s, anyone would actually dress like Ronald did. The fact is that Dempsey was never really a nerd, but Hollywood actually tried to make us believe it. I also found it a bit absurd that Ronald this deep into his high school existence would even care about being popular with those jerk jocks who shunned him all those years. Now gaining cred so he could get with those hot cheerleaders is another story! lol But he knew full well that this popularity couldn't and wouldn't last past high school anyway. And did Cindy's ""friends"" really believe that Ron would dare dump the most popular girl in high school? They really couldn't see through their gimmick?But the main premise of the film is what really bothered me. The premise of this film is just so flimsy and it doesn't hold up compared to many other great 80s comedies. The fact that Ron had to pay this girl $1000 to be seen with him is disturbing. But what really gets me is the big secret gets exposed, somehow Ronald is the school pariah, but the girl who took his money is still very much popular. Uh, you took money to be his girlfriend, lady. How are you somehow less pathetic than he is? Also, this loser geek manages to snow an entire school into thinking he's actually cool and somehow HE is the only one who is dense in this situation? In reality, this guy would be an absolute legend in the annals of the school's history for pulling off this stunt, not scoffed at. Ken even said it to the group of geeks that Ron actually had a good couple of months of being the most popular kid in school which is something those guys could only dream of having. And although I really did like the individual performances of Dempsey and Peterson, I didn't really buy the love story at all. It seemed too clean and cliche that Cindy realized she loved Ron after only being together for a hot minute. And then somehow he loved her even after he completely dismissed her to be with all those other popular cheerleaders. The post fallout scenes really felt disingenuous to me just to have a happy ending.Another thing, why did Cindy still remain friends with her popular clique if she had suddenly ""awakened""? Maybe it was the acting, or lack thereof, but not once did I feel like any of them became different or better people that would make Cindy stay friends with them. They only liked Cindy because she was popular, then only liked Ron because of some fake relationship with Cindy, and as soon as Cindy outed him, they dumped him like yesterday's newspaper. Also, Cindy staying friends with them and never showing an inclination to be friends with any of Ron's clique or less popular kids says a lot about her character. Basically, she did want the popularity and all that comes with it, but at the same time when she fell for Ron, she only really wanted his full attention minus the hard part of integrating herself with his group of friends. I felt like her character was a bunch of talk and very little action. This romance just didn't hit the right marks for me.When I was younger, I probably did root for Ron and Cindy, but on re-watch, I found myself caring most about Ron and Ken's relationship and the resolution to that. First, their arcade scene interaction was very raw and heartbreaking. Then in the movie's best scene, Ron stands up to one of those jocks who threatens Ken and this powerful moment pretty much mends their broken relationship. I felt more realism in the dissolution and resolution of the friendship than I did in the cliche happy romantic ending. Another thing I really enjoyed in this movie is Dempsey's energy and physicality. He had a unique ability to use his body to display emotion and this physical comedy was ever present in all the movies he did in the 80s through the 90s before he decided to tone it down to become a more ""serious"" actor. Probably an unpopular opinion, but this is not my favorite ""Patrick Dempsey as a nerd"" flick. I'll take the fluffy Loverboy or the energetic Run over this not so timeless comedy.",Can't Buy Me Love
18,mattymatt4ever,Good flyweight entertainment,7,4 June 2002,"I've seen bundles of these teen comedies, and ""Can't Buy Me Love"" does contain every cliche in the book.  But it was made in 1987.  This was a little past the dawning of the high school movie, and the characters of the nerd, jock, cheerleader, etc. were just recently created.  I don't know. Maybe this movie was even a huge cliche back in the eighties.  But I'm still gonna give it the benefit of the doubt.  I catch this movie on TBS quite a lot of times, and I can't help but enjoy it.  There are certain cliched scenes that just force me to roll my eyes and sigh, yet I can't change the channel.  Well, there are two key elements that make this flyweight teen comedy work:  Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson. They both give charming performances, and have a wonderful chemistry.  Even though you know exactly what will happen between them, it's still a delight to see them on screen.  Dempsey hasn't had a big role in years, and you can technically classify him as a has-been, but he is a good, charismatic actor. And it would've been nice if his career actually took off.  As for Peterson, I don't remember her from any other movies, so I have no knowledge of her career.  All I know is she's good-looking and I liked her in this movie.  The story is as predictable as you can get, with paperthin characters, but as I said it's good flyweight entertainment.  Strictly a guilty pleasure. If I were in the mood for a good--and by that I mean good in quality--high school movie I'd watch ""Ghost World"" or one of the ""American Pie"" movies. But if I just want to kick back and watch a cheesy high school movie that will put a smile on my face and contains no intellectual value, I'll watch ""Can't Buy Me Love.""  Of course, the movie has a ""message"" at the end about being yourself, and not caring what others think of you, but the message is delivered with the finesse of an after-school special and is strictly pasted on.  When you have characters that are so stereotypical and implausible, it's hard to fit in a believable message.  But what would a high school movie be without a schmaltzy third act?  That's why I recommend this movie, just as a guilty pleasure.  It's far from great, yet undeniably appealing.  But please do not bother to analyze this movie.  You'll be wasting your time.    My score:  7 (out of 10)",Can't Buy Me Love
19,CitizenCaine,Can't Buy A Date,5,5 July 2008,"Patrick Dempsey stars as what is referred to as a dork in the movie but what we would probably refer to as normal today. Truth is in real high school, there are far more dorks and/or normal kids than there are hotties and cool types. However, only a dork would pay $1000 to make a girl pretend to be his girlfriend for a month. Of course the typical complications ensue, but the movie forces us to see the failure of Dempsey's ways over and over. The fact is most girls would be turned off by the desperation that they would gladly shake themselves loose after a month's time. This 80's male fantasy film tries to convince us that the Patrick Dempsey types of the high school world would quickly turn into big-headed jerks, and the cool hottie girl in high school is as nice as pie. The supporting student roles are so stereotyped in the film they border on parodies of themselves. The film is inspirational though in that it demonstrates to those of us dorks who toiled beyond high school scouring the world for female companionship (for no other reason than nobody wanted us) that we should have just been ourselves, and we would have been fine. Yeah I can just see thousands of hottie cheerleader types flocking to thin, gangly guys with no sense of high school fashion because gangly guys are just being themselves. For sure... The irony is Patrick Dempsey is now a hottie among the 40's set courtesy of Grey's Anatomy. ** of 4 stars.",Can't Buy Me Love

22,dansview,Dempsey Saves The Day,6,10 November 2013,"Patrick Dempsey was immensely charming back in the day. He still is. But his skinny geek routine was priceless in the 80's and early 90's. He managed to infuse it with style and grace and make you root for him, while avoiding clichés. It takes skill to own an image without copying someone else's version.This one covers the familiar 80's high school social-class-conflict theme but, also touches on an interesting concept. People want something when they see that someone they respect wants it. I've been there. If you're seen with an attractive girl, other girls who never considered you, start taking a second look. Dempsey's character, being one of the smart kids, figures this out.There is some gross out humor that really turned me off. Seth Green is adorable and funny as the annoying little brother. I had no idea he was old enough to have been in movies back then.One thing that cracks me up is that Dempsey frequently appeared as the unofficial Jewish guy in these teen movies, because he is from the East Coast, has dark hair, a prominent nose, and played a geek. But I'm guessing he is Irish.Apparently Amanda Peterson was only 16 when this film came out and perhaps even younger while filming. Usually the actors playing a Senior in high school are in their 20's. In this case, she was younger than a Senior and had never even experienced being a Senior before in real life. She was relatively cute and most effective when she told off some stud who was bothering her at a lunch table. I liked her character because she knew who and what she was, but she was willing to take some chances.Believe me though, that most of the snobbish popular kids in real 80's high schools were shallow and not very nice people.Check it out on youtube.",Can't Buy Me Love

It's a well constructed world and development.. but somehow, Patrick's character is just too inconsistent and weird and pathetic at times.

I get the concept of it all, and in my imagination, there's a better movie here with all the other right pieces.Amanda is the best thing of the movie! Passionate, loyal and caring.

25,spasek,The Best Teen Flicks Are Often the Ones With a Message,8,6 February 2021,"I saw this movie when it came out in the theater. I was a high school student out on one of his first dates. Little did anyone know, including my girlfriend, that I was suffering from a severe lack of self-esteem.""Can't Buy Me Love"" spoke to me because I could relate completely with Ronald Miller. Imagine being one of those ""outcasts"" who dreams of going out with the prettiest girl in school? Somehow, I doubt I've been the only one.""Can't Buy Me Love"" joins the small fraternity of teen films such as ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" ""The Breakfast Club,"" and ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" as films that are easily relatable because most teens have ""been there"" and/or are going through it.While the premise might seem silly, it somehow works. A high school boy, who has been dreaming about being with the hottest girl (Cindy Mancini) in school, finds a way to buy her time; $1000 for a month of being with her. Of course, the entire thing is a facade, but something interesting happens, which shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone when a couple spend time together. Cindy begins to see Ronald in a whole new light. However, due to his lack of self-worth, Ronald is unable to see this because he's blinded by the belief that there is no way someone like Cindy could ever like him. And that is why this movie works so well. Like two ships passing by each other, one is constantly blinded at some point, with neither one able to see the other at the same time.Reputation always has a price, which Ronald will learn one of the hardest lessons. Cindy tries to warn him, but of course, he refuses to listen.Cindy is popular, vain, and a bit stuck-up, but she will always do right by someone. Upon seeing how he's been so badly treated, it doesn't take her long to stick up for him. She also has no problem calling out her friends either.Ronald lacks self-worth, but he is smart, and his ""loyalty"" to his real friends is tested. Unlike Cindy, he's able to easily trade time with his friends for what is most important to him: recognition.Of course, it isn't until the end when Ronald realizes what is truly important. Most teens can definitely relate to how hard it is to just be yourself. Many adults have the same problem!The performances are outstanding, and I remember the speech at the end taking everyone by surprise by its powerful truth. This movie will always be among my favorite teen flicks!",Can't Buy Me Love
26,buzznzipp1995,My oh my oh my! Memories of scammin' in high school,10,5 February 2007,"I think if you listen to the lyrics of Neil Young's 'Keep on rockin' in the free world' it's kind of like a make-shift anthem for high school people. In a way, not all will agree with Neil or the song, but this movie had me in stitches (at times) given that I didn't laugh as much as ""Fast Times At Ridgemeont High"", this was a more heart felt story of a young nerd/geek (Dempsey)who is definitely coming into his own. Not all geeks stay geeks. Not all nerds stay nerds either. Patrick Dempsey successfully plays the guy you root for! And on top of it all are Cindy's gorgeous girlfriends that he is now a part of ...their world.Look back at your high school days and see who really changed. It's quite amazing sometimes. In this fun flick made in good Ole Tucson Arizona, the cast of nuts and crazies was like the stock market, with that 'Popularity' thing, up, up, up, then down and out. Patrick Dempsey was so right in this 'Ronny' character, I still laugh. I kind of remember a Cindy Mancini type in high school, which I'm sure many do. That super-hot chic, guys were lining up for. Back in 1998, I was working at a resort in Phoenix and got to meet and put Amanda Petersen (Cindy Mancini) into a town-car for the airport. She was very nice and looked great in person. She signed my little ticket, and called me 'Babe', I was charmed by her she was very wonderful to meet even briefly. She kissed me on the cheek, before getting into the Towncar...it was one of those moments in life. I probably looked like Charlie Brown after being kissed by the little red-headed girl at that point as the car was pulling away.I recommend this for all the high school crazy antics we all did and or miss, from that era in our lives.

27,d_m_s,Can't Buy Me Love,6,5 February 2014,"Never heard of this film before but it was a recommendation from Netflix so, after checking out an IMDb review, I watched.It was an enjoyable 80's teen comedy that is far superior to the usual John Hughes films that spring to mind when you think of 80's teen comedy.I give it a 6 but I would liked to have given it more. It had loads of potential to be a lot better, easily an 8, but some simple mistakes were made that let it down. Like using Patrick Dempsey as the lead when at no point is he convincing as a geek as he is far too handsome and has a good physique. His performance is confident rather than geeky also. Another reviewer has pointed this out and I agree.I also agree with the same reviewer who stated that Amanda Peterson's portrayal of the popular cheerleader is a compassionate one and makes it more watchable.There are some good scenes and some good laughs but throughout the whole thing I just kept thinking how much better it could have been if they'd have picked a better lead (I kept thinking of the better geek portrayals in Revenge of the Nerds), and spent a little more time on the characters, sub plots and jokes, which often felt like they all had so much potential that wasn't fully developed.I do like how the jocks and cheerleaders, while somewhat lampooned, also all have a sympathetic side. So credit is due to the writer and/or director for not making them two dimensional. Equally, there are moments that feel rushed, as if no one could be bothered to develop the characters adequately.Still, it is an easy to watch, enjoyable, charming film.",Can't Buy Me Love

While looking at the telescope at the mall he sees Cindy carrying clothes to a store trying to return it.  He shows her that he has the money so she can replace her mother's outfit only if she acts like they are going out for a month so he can be popular.  She eventually accepts his deal and he becomes popular.  But his luck soon runs out on New Years Eve at the party when Cindy's boyfriend from college comes home and finds out what she did calling her a prostitute.

He rents Cindy for a month and this does make him popular but it falls apart near the end of the movie. Not hard to predict that it would fall apart. It has good story but too slow in some sections. The drama is well done but the humor isn't that funny at all. The ending of this movie has been rip off a number of times. The nerd gets popular girl that concept was most recently used in The Faculty. The movie has some of the worst 80's music I have heard. Good performances make the bland characters convincing.

But when I periodically, or rather took a look from the beginning, interest began to wake up.The characters are very traditionally stereotypical and disgusting. On the other hand, it was nice to follow the journey of this unpopular character in a changing life situation. And what's funniest, if you can say it, is identifying an actor when you've only seen him as an adult in some role. So I will watch 87 films of the year in 2021 ..Fortunately, once again, the end brings with it something good.

Every line of dialogue, every character, the setting, the music, the plot, the ending - everything is cliché. It's just a formula. Here's a list: high school setting, nerd/cool transformation, football player guy/cheerleader girl combination, nerd friends/jock friends, reversal of popularity/coolness by someone who formerly had popularity/coolness, the sentimental seriousness near the end of the movie with the soft rock 80s music playing in the background, and ... and this is the best of the whole lot ... the slow clap at the end of the movie cheering him on.No kidding!! A slow clap develops and develops and then everyone's cheering and everything's great! But it's serious!!! I'm not sure if this is a 1 or a 10 or somewhere in between. It's baffling! Someone could have written this whole script in half a day, the plot is so cliché and formulaic that, when you add the cliché characters in the mix, and the cliché setting, the script virtually writes itself. Think about it. You're a writer in Hollywood in the 80s and you throw the plot, setting, and characters together in your mind and you would just naturally start writing because it's so easy, it's so so easy, the whole script is already written for you, you just have to fill it in.

I could tell just by the description in the photo cover that I was going to really like this movie.Cindy and Ronald have amazing chemistry in this movie and both of their characters really surprised me. I thought I had the movie predicted that she would fall for him during their ""deal"" but I never suspected that he would become such a jerk in the process. He really did let it go to his head!My favorite scenes were of Cindy and Ronald together, my only complaint is that I wish we had seen them bond more before he became a narcissistic jerk. The scene with the airplane graveyard and the moon was absolutely beautiful. It broke my heart that she thought they were going to continue seeing each other but he thought otherwise. It's sad because if she had expressed her feelings right then and there, I do not think that chaos would have ensued as it did.I also would have liked more clarity on Cindy and Bobby's relationship. Did he seriously not call her from the first day of school through new year's? Because that's what it seemed like and if so, I have no idea what he thought he had to be angry about. The remains of their relationship seemed to be a joke to me and deep down, I think Cindy knew that and that was why she was dating other guys.Lots of laughs and tears throughout the movie with great acting by the main cast. And a baby Seth Green! It was sad but understandable why Kenneth would not forgive Ronald for what he had done. I am glad they all worked it out in the end like true friends. It is very insightful how Ronald becoming a bad person made Cindy become a better person. She saw first hand how she had been behaving all these years and how it wasn't worth it. Her character really surprised me. I wish the ending hadn't felt so rushed but it was definitely a happy one! I would definitely recommend this movie to all!",Can't Buy Me Love

41,fineanimal,Underrated and charming 80's teen flick,8,29 September 2002,"Most 80's teen flicks leave a rather sick feeling in my stomach, but this one has always been a favorite despite the stereotypical shallow, big-haired girls and the Animal House wanna-be jocks. The difference is that the stars, Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson, are not so stereotypical in their roles as lonely nerd and ultra-popular head cheerleader.Patrick Dempsey has always been underrated as an actor with style, and it is unfortunate that his character, Ronald, is so unlikable after the film's premise kicks in. Ronald goes ""from geek to chic"" and back again. But Dempsey himself seems too inherently confident to really pull off the geek aspect believably, and he's too cruel to the girl whose heart he won for Ronald to be a truly sympathetic character. The hip version of Ronald, however, is a hoot to watch, even if it is somewhat overdone in the context of an already unlikely plot. The standout in this film is Amanda Peterson, whose character Cindy has to be one of the most genuinely likeable ""stuck up"" high school girls on film. Watching her character grow and open her heart to Ronald is the main reason I've given this film repeated viewings. Although the genres are quite different, I'd compare Peterson's character to Renee Zellweger's character in Jerry MaGuire in terms of sheer likability. Making characters likeable is much more difficult than making them sympathetic, and I'm frankly shocked that Peterson's career did not skyrocket after this performance.Whether you're looking for creative ways to invest $1000 or dancing lessons, Can't Buy Me Love is one 80's teen flick that has a lot to offer.",Can't Buy Me Love

I can tell you why this movie was not a hit when it came out but really is a cult favorite now. This movie exposed the 'popular' myth, it showed just how fragile and shallow the 'popular' thing is and how many are simply followers. Of course popular kids at the time would not warm to this movie, it showed them to be either manipulators or followers neither of which anyone wanted to admit to.People mention how this movie does not compare to John Hughes films, and you are right. Because in his flicks the popular kids come out looking good at the end. Hughes films are better written and overall acted but they are not as honest or real as this movie.I am sick of people complaining about stereotypes. Why/How does a stereotype exist?!?! Because there are many, many people who ARE the stereotype. Stereotypes are not created from nothing, they are the single expression of large whole. Complain about stereotypes when they are inaccurate. The stereotypes in this movie are spot on.I know personally that a big reason I love this movie is because I was on both sides of the fence. I was in the popular crowd when I was young, from 1st - 7th grades. Then we moved. For a year I was kinda a nerd/loner, I just hung around the perimeter. I was friends with most of the 'popular' girls but disliked almost all the 'popular' guys so eventually did my own thing. I was liked by most groups at the school but was not part of the 'popular' group.. by choice. But I also did one of the meanest things I have ever done in my life. I basically stole another guys friend and then told him to beat it because he was not 'cool' enough. I am still ashamed of that. I was basically a kid trying to be cool that really was a nerd inside. Moved again for my last 2 years of HS. This really was a bizarre experience as the 'popular' group was small and not well defined. I think this was due to so many new students moving into the area and I guess disrupting things. My best friend was a nerd, but a very very smart one, and a year younger. Again I did my own thing and liked who I wanted to like. It was also at this HS that I witnessed something very similar to the movie.This was in the grade below me. A 'popular' pretty girl dumped a jock and began dating a guy from the 'bad' crowd, you know the group that wore metal concert t-shirts and smoked. Wow, it was amazing to see the effects this had on the school and in particular that class, it turned the whole 'popular' thing on it's head.One other reason this movie works is that the chemistry between Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson is obvious.

57,the_doctor,classic 80s comedy - for those into that sort of thing,8,14 March 2003,"I loved this film, but I admit it's a love it or hate it sort of flick - a high school nerd wants to be cool, so he pays a cheerleader to date him for a while, but he becomes too arrogant and it all comes crashing down around him, and I think you can work out how it goes from here.It's a classic 1980s teen film, perhaps comparable to 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' or the 'Revenge of the Nerds' series of films in its attitude and style, although the story is most similar to the more recent 'She's All That' starring Freddie Prinze Jnr and Rachel Leigh Cook. Having said that it could probably be compared to every teen flick devised in the last twenty years, although this one is more charming in its innocence and kitsch value than most more modern efforts.Expect to be entertained, if not amazed by the quality of the acting or the scriptwriting. Watch this if you're in the mood for some light hearted (and light headed) comedy.",Can't Buy Me Love
58,groktalo,"Standard romantic plot, but good insights",9,22 January 2013,"The movie has a typical romantic plot within an American high-school setting, with lead characters being a nerd (Ronald) and the head cheerleader (Cindy). She and her friends would not even acknowledge him when passing by whereas he is desperately infatuated her. Ronald figures that he needs to become popular in order to be noticed by girls and offers Cindy a thousand dollars to pretend in public that they are going out, hoping that it would boost his popularity. She accepts the offer and throws in his makeover at no extra cost. The rest of the storyline is fairly predictable. However, there are two issues that this movie addresses probably more successfully than most of the other teen chick flicks: leadership and forgiveness.The rest may contain some spoilers.Ronald aspires not only to acceptance by his peers, but also to becoming their informal leader. The path that he initially takes in order to achieve that status is typical of a high-school environment, as he chooses exclusivity over social cohesion, egoism over altruism, herd mentality over individuality and conceit over humility. Eventually, he realises that sustainable informal leadership is based on selfless acts and promoting social inclusion.Whilst at the peak of his ill-gotten popularity, Ronald does not forgive Cindy the fact that she used to ignore him when he was just one of the geeks. In fact, he cruelly rejects her even though she has developed warm feelings for him and has extended him support and trust that are well in excess of what is stipulated in their arrangement. However, once his popularity has vanished and he is left with no friends, he expects Cindy and his former best friend to immediately take him back and forgive all the gross insults he has inflicted upon them. Having failed that, Ronald finally realises that he needs to deserve to be forgiven.",Can't Buy Me Love
59,LADodger,Be careful what you wish for you just might get it.....,7,13 August 2002,"I guess in the case of this movie you could say ""you might get what you paid for"". The messages in this movie are pretty clear. They are made easy to identify by many simple one dimensional supporting characters and a few scenes devoted to clearly spelling a message out. This movie is extremely stereotypical, but it was made in and about a very stereotypical time, so I don't think they went too far in portraying these characters as their stereotypes and little else. The messages and characters will seem very familiar to those of us who grew up and went to high school in the 80's, but may be be lost on teenagers today. All of that said this is basically a pretty good movie, that I can never turn off when I happen to catch it on cable. The performances are very good by the main characters and reasonably good by some of the supporting characters and the scenes move well without any wasted time. There is very little build up to any of the movies scenes, so there is really something going on all the time. Not in the same class as The Breakfast Club or Sixteen Candles, but very watchable and enjoyable.",Can't Buy Me Love

69,EmreBilge,Best of the genre for its suspenseful story and the messages it gives.,9,23 April 2019,"The ""nerd"" Ronald Miller doesn't appreciate his group of friends and their activities of playing cards and video games. He wants to do something else in his senior year. He craves the life of the ""jocks"" who date and party which seems to be the privilege of being ""popular"" at his school. He is also fed up with going ""the long route through the library"" instead of simply walking ""the cool hallway"" en route to his class, sitting at the corners of the cafeteria and the ""visiting section"" at his ""own school"" to watch his school team's matches. To make matters worse, he has a crush on the head cheerleader, Cindy. Up to this point, your standard youth movie storyline. Assuming that ""popularity"" would bring him happiness, Ronald decides to offer Cindy $1000 he has been saving mowing the lawn to buy a telescope in return for she pretending for one month that they are dating. His plan goes smoothly at first for quite a good amount of time after which things take a terrible turn.Congratulations to the director Steve Rash, the writer Michael Swerdlick and the cast. Basically for two unexpected reasons for its genre, this movie is the best of all the youth romantic comedies I have seen. First, the movie has twists and turns in the story and character development which make a variety of endings possible, boost your interest and make you curious in what is going to happen next. Second, the movie does not merely have the generic light-hearted elements of the genre such as parties, relationships, the feud between the different social ""layers"" in high school.The remaining paragraphs may contain some spoilers.The movie gives the youth the life lessons that things you are craving now are not what they seem like, are not really what really matters in life and will not necessarily make you happy in the long term. Falling for short-term cravings and passions interfere with the ability of the brain to process reasonably which leads to dishonesty which leads to regret, loss of dignity and self-respect.For his age, what Ronald has done can be forgiven especially because, at the end, he realizes his terrible ways even though only after losing the pseudo-popularity and even the former respect as a fellow human and schoolmate, after having rejected Cindy's now sincere (yet, unrealistic in real life) intimacy attempts, having ditched his former friends, so ending up having nowhere to turn to. The showdown between Ronald and the fiercest jock (despite not being the leader), Quint, which was caused by Quint's harassing Kenneth, his former best friend he ditched to be with the popular group, wasn't expected and was dramatic with perhaps long-time consequences for the informal caste system of the school. Ronald was so regretful of going out of himself, his personality, rejecting his friends, his terrible behaviour against his best friend Kenneth and furious at the unjust attitude of the popular group against him, his friends and the other outcasts at the school that he couldn't take it anymore which gave him the courage to stand up to Quint for Kenneth. This and how he handled the rest with Quint is amazing and what restored his dignity and which perhaps raised him to a level of respect which isn't what he had planned with his $1000 at the beginning, but a more dignified, long-term one. He didn't take a step back and vowed to fight Quint if he wouldn't let Kenneth go. Then, he reminded Quint how once they were all friends, Quint fell out of Ronald's tree house and Kenneth picked him up and the two carried him 12 blocks to the hospital and now he wants to kill Kenneth because he's talking to one of the cheerleaders on their ""side of the cafeteria"". This was a perfect balance of standing up to Quint, showing him that he's not afraid of him and ready to fight if that's the last resort vs. reminding him of how they were once all friends, they even helped him when he was desperate. A perfect concept to invoke the humanity in a fierce person. Ronald now did really grow up, didn't he?I was also impressed with the brief scene with the African-American teacher stopping the older female school principal from intervening in the fight. He seemed like a far-sighted teacher. He was perfectly cognizant of the situation and the high emotions on the two opposite camps, but still let Ronald express his wounds and insecurities growing inside of him for a long time and let him reach a resolution for himself with perhaps positive consequences for all schoolmates. He seemed cognizant that the fight could lead to a rapprochement and understanding between the two camps and lowering the barriers. I would have liked this character had a longer role in the script.So what may happen next? Of course jocks will still be jocks, nerds will still be nerds (forget these terms anyway, I am just using these terms as everybody is familiar with them which helps to get my points across). But they will respect each other more. They will acknowledge that nobody is perfect, everybody has ups and downs; that one being good at sports, the other good at lessons, etc., both qualities are noteworthy, complementary and may contribute to accomplishments for their schools and their future. And best of all is when you are humble and appreciate others, your qualities are appreciated in return and you get more respect compared to the case of behaving the other way around. Lessons most of us don't learn at high school, but when we're older. Whether or not Ronald became popular or got Cindy is besides the point and which is what places this movie in a different and special place among its genre. I recommend this movie for adults as well as the youth as adults can also enjoy it. They can also draw lessons as age alone does not necessarily make one mistake-proof and there is always ground for further improvement.",Can't Buy Me Love

Yeah, unless you were already in it we all thought about it at one point or another but in the movie I'm reviewing this time, Can't Buy me Love, Ronny Miller played by Patrick Dempsey actually got a chance to. In this movie which I stumbled upon one early Saturday morning while watching HBO as a kid, Ronny Miller saves up one-thousand dollars for a telescope that he earns from mowing lawns. When he goes to buy the telescope he notices Cindy Mancini, played by Amanda Peterson, who of course is the most popular girl in school in need of some help. She tells him that she ruined her mothers dress and that she has no way of replacing it. Ronny decides to buy her a new one in exchange for a date that he hopes will make him popular.I didn't know why I loved this movie as a kid so much. There was no slapstick comedy,no crazy characters or even any action but maybe when I look back that's what I loved about it so much.It just felt real. It felt like typical high school even though I didn't truly know what that was since I was only ten. My favorite part of the movie was that they cast a young Seth Green as the role of Ronnys little brother.For this movie I'll give it four Seth greens out of five only for the fact that every time this movie is on no matter what part it's at I'll have to sit and watch it to the end.",Can't Buy Me Love

This one has a few things in common with Hughes. The sense of place: Tuscon is as much a character in this movie as Chicago is for Hughes. The details: Some of the best bits in this film aren't spotted until the umpteenth viewing. For example, how many people noticed that right after Ronnie asks Cindy, ""What's his name? Biff?"", we see that Brett's license plate starts with BYF. And so on.What this movie does that Hughes never did was show how much the ""popular"" kids were bigger sheep than the nerds trying to break in. ""If the Ronster is doing it, it must be new!"", and so everyone at the dance is spazzing out to the African Anteater Ritual (which, BTW, someone needs to mention on American Idol, just for the chance of making a pop-culture reference that stumps Randy and Simon but not Paula).

I think everyone at times, feels like they are missing out on something, that the other crowd is having more fun than you. This gets played up to the extreme as Ronald Miller goes from being ""totally geek, to totally chic"" only to lose it all again in heartbreaking fashion.The fine acting of a young Patrick Dempsey, and the gone too soon Amanda Petterson really make the movie for me as the chemistry is real and the awesome scenes together make me smile everytime I watch (which is nearing 20 viewings now)Courtney Gains does an excellent job of being the neglected best friend who sees his friend descend into an unrecognizable jerk and the scenes involving their eventual loss of friendship are tough to watch.It is not perfect, it shows it age a bit but having just watched it recently...I still love it.",Can't Buy Me Love
