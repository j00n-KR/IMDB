0,TheLittleSongbird,Just about enough beauty to steal,6,2 July 2019,"There were a fair few reasons for wanting to see 'Stealing Beauty'. That it had Italy, or Tuscany to be more specific, as its location, which has as beautiful scenery as one can get. Bernardo Bertolucci was an interesting director and made some great films in his career. The soundtrack also sounded appetising, with some great pieces/songs featured (i.e. the 2nd movement of Mozart's clarinet concerto) as well as an immensely talented cast that one could not go wrong with.'Stealing Beauty' to me was not a bad film. There are many good points, the best assets brilliant even and luckily they were the components that were what made me want to see it. 'Stealing Beauty' also though could have quite a lot better, with some important components not executed to full potential or properly. There are directors that make great films but also are responsible for the odd big misfire that make one wonder ""this comes from the same director that made that"". 'Stealing Beauty' doesn't reach that level, or so that's to me (not an agreeable opinion with critics), though it's not one of Bertolucci's best and not on the same level as masterpieces of his such as 'Last Tango in Paris' and 'The Last Emperor'.Will start with what worked very well. The best thing about 'Stealing Beauty' is the scenery, which really takes the breath away. If you have not been to Tuscany or Italy, it cannot be recommended highly enough as they are even more beautiful in real life than depicted in the film. Adding further to the visual magic is the wondrous photography, a lot of the shots left me in awe and is as entranced by the scenery as the viewer is (the camera also clearly loves Liv Tyler, perhaps a little too much at times, and she does look wonderful in the film as a result). Bertolucci's visual style and overall directing style are all over the film. The soundtrack is also a major strength, a wide variety of styles used well and not feeling too much of a mishmash, the Mozart especially is used well (haven't seen Mozart used this well on film in a while) and brings a real poignant air.Liv Tyler did go on to much better things and inexperience shows at times here, but mostly she does a more than credible job in a role not easy to pull off. The standout of the rest of the game cast is Jeremy Irons in a very touching performance as the most sympathetic character in the film. His and Tyler's chemistry is both charming and poignant and by far the most believable of all the character interactions. Alex's dialogue is beautifully poetic, and his last scene did bring tears to my eyes. Although the script and character writing is flawed, the cast give more than game performances and nobody really is bad (had reservations with one). 'Stealing Beauty' does have a gentle charm that does endear.For all those great things, there are elements that 'Stealing Beauty' falls short upon. The script only really rings true with Alex's dialogue, too much of the rest felt artificial and insipid. The only well developed characters are Lucy and Alex, found the rest one-dimensional and lacking in warmth. Focusing on less characters and developing the rest more that already would have made things better. Rachel Weisz's character is especially shallow. Do agree that Weisz didn't seem to fit and does little to bring much to her role.Although the gentle charm is there, there are poignant moments in the chemistry between Lucy and Alex and the character of Alex and the atmosphere is there, the story does slip on more than one occasion into bathos. It also tends to meander and feel unfocused and it can drag, too little feels explored enough. The ending felt almost too pat and abrupt.Overall, lots of great things but some big flaws too. 6/10",Stealing Beauty
1,SnoopyStyle,"slow, meandering, melodic",5,23 January 2015,Lucy Harmon (Liv Tyler) comes to Italian villa to visit family friends Diana (Sinéad Cusack) and Ian Grayson (Donal McCann). It's been 4 years since her visit and Ian is doing her portrait. There are several people staying at the villa. Sickly writer Alex Parrish (Jeremy Irons) is a friend of her dead mother. Richard Reed (D. W. Moffett) keeps flirting which get his girlfriend Miranda Fox (Rachel Weisz) jealous. Every men are fascinated by the virginal Lucy and she's pining to find love.It's a slow meandering visit to a beautiful Italian villa by Bernardo Bertolucci. The main problem seems to be that Liv Tyler isn't given control of the movie. It needs to be her movie and from her point of view. She needs to be given a real voice but Liv is a bit too quiet. She is angelic but she needs to sound out her thoughts. She writes in her diary which diminishes it. Maybe if the movie included narration from her. I'm not usually a fan of voice-overs but the movie needs something more from her.,Stealing Beauty
2,rmax304823,Deliberately Paced and Atmospheric Tale.,6,21 June 2009,"Watching this is like taking a leisurely vacation in the rolling hills of Tuscany. I don't think there's any place in America that has such a sky. The sun seems a misty ochre and the land, where it's not tilled in straight furrows, consists of gravel paths between low stone walls, olive groves, chest-high grape arbors, and dark sturdy oaks. The arbors are populated by hordes of skittery lizards, Lacerta muralis. It's no wonder that summer dinners so often are eaten on long tables al fresco. What an appealing location.And that, maybe, is the principal virtue of Bernardo Bertolucci's ""Stealing Beauty."" It takes patience and concentration to follow the story closely enough to be engaged by it, and, at heart, there really isn't much to it. A visiting American, the pretty and leggy Liv Tyler, finds out that a local artist is probably her real father, and shortly afterward gives up her virginity to an equally inexperienced local boy.There's a lot of casual conversation, some of which seems to have little point. The function of some characters is a bit obscure. Jeremy Irons, a splendid actor, plays an older man who offers to serve as Liv Tyler's father. He's ill and is finally driven away in an ambulance. An almost unrecognizable Jean Marais is a dotty French visitor. Where do the French get these actors? They're sympatico without being particularly handsome. Jean Gabin, Philippe Noiret. I think I'll exclude Yves Montand because a girl friend once told me he was handsome, and I'm not talking about physical beauty.With Bernardo Bertolucci you generally get some fairly explicit sex, as you do here. There is a party one night. After the guests are exhausted by all that dancing, they retire to engage in sexual activities of various stripes. (Poor Rachel Weisz.) But it's far from soft-core porn. Bertolucci avoids the billowing curtains and candle light clichés. There are no fingertips caressing unidentifiable furrows of someone else's body. When the sweet but innocent Italian boy is about to deflower Liv Tyler, he asks, ""Can you help me?"", and she slides her hand down inside his jeans. It's not exactly a torrid scene, though, and it doesn't end dramatically. The next morning, strolling back to the villa, the kid says that he'd like to follow her to America. She turns and replies, ""Do so."" And that's that. The kid runs off, waving, and we don't know whether he'll follow her or not, nor do we care anymore than Liv Tyler seems to care.It's in no way a breakthrough film. Bertolucci takes his time and forces us to relax too. There's no violence and no tragedy. I have some trouble imagining most teen-aged kids enjoying this, especially the boys, whose taste and patience have been eroded over the years by exposure to a nimiety of films in which a shoot out with ugly guns has to take place every ten minutes. (Compare the original 1974 ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3"" with this year's remake, for an example of how esthetic values have devolved.) Liv Tyler gets stung on the arm and the breast by bees, but, you know what? I don't care. I'd like to be among that crowd for a summer. Sure, it would be tough, brushing up on whatever Italian I remember, but I wouldn't have to relearn any of it if Liv Tyler and her legs should come visiting. She speaks surprisingly good English for an American.",Stealing Beauty
3,Quinoa1984,Bertolucci's Portrait of the Virgin at 19,7,17 June 2008,"Stealing Beauty is a character piece, not so much ever really driven by plot, and which makes it a particularly European-flavored entry in the Bernardo Bertolucci cannon of films he's made. This shouldn't be a surprise; the guy's been making them this way for most of his career, save for when he can't not have some semblance of a story (i.e. 1900 and Last Emperor, which were epics). It's got some purely luscious cinematography- thanks, in part, to the equally luscious and vibrant locations out in these Tuscan fields and villas and vineyards and homes, all secluded like in an over-elaborate dream- and some brilliant moments, though in the end it's almost something of a minor work for the director. The most admirable aspect is that he's able, in short, to make a contemporary movie that doesn't feel stuck in time.It's a 90's movie, with a hot-young-talent in her first role (I think it's her first), Liv Tyler, and in a way it works that she's not all that great in the part. Her awkwardness, her moments of sadness over her character's loss of her mother and the confusion over who her father really is, and the girlish and nearly overrated conundrum of still being a virgin, works to her ability as a 'first-timer', so to speak. And, luckily, she's surrounded by much better actors, people like Jeremy Irons who has a presence that is immense and cool even when bed-ridden for much of the film (thankfully it doesn't turn out how I originally thought the set-up would be with him wooing Tyler), and Rachel Weisz in one of her early roles as a woman who has reasonable suspicion her self-absorbed American husband is a lying/cheating louse. There are others as well, like the one who plays the old Frenchman (I forget his name), who's incredible as the old crank who can't bear to be where he's at.If it does feel like a minor work, as I mentioned, it's that Bertolucci- working from his original concept with a screenwriter- doesn't give very much depth to the situation, or to some of the characters, until a little more than halfway through the movie. For a while it feels like a shallow enterprise, the kind of ""will she or won't she"" attitude towards sex that should be above him. But at some point there's something that opens up a little bit, then a little more, and all the while as Tyler's Lucy becomes more aware of what matters the central conceit starts to become less and less like some big hurdle and something more natural. As well as this, Bertolucci does litter his film, which is uncharacteristically good in the present setting (he blends musical choices very well, from alternative rock to old R&B and classical and jazz) and has a couple of really tremendous scenes. The bit at the party where Tyler and a possible-father dance and the dancers all choreographed and strange come in, it's enthralling.Fans of the director should check it out, as should for those of the actors, but this being said it's almost kind of a light work. Lacking really hardcore dramatic tension, it's mostly predicated on a 19-year old girl's quasi-coming-of-age. Which is interesting, up to a point.",Stealing Beauty
4,lastliberal,The search for Dad,7,22 July 2007,"Liv Tyler's (Armageddon, LOTR trilogy) mother has just committed suicide and she goes to Tuyscany to visit her mother's friends in a coming-of-age adventure. Director Bernardo Bertolucci (The Last Emporer) strive to bring out in Tyler what is probably her best screen performance.This was Joseph Fiennes' (Shakespher in Love) first film role, and one of the first for Rachel Weisz (The Constant Gardener, The Mummy).With a great performance by Jeremy Irons (Elizabeth I, Reversal of Fortune), this film is a story about life and death and the search for who you are. It is character focused. Some of the best parts are gatherings where you just watch the characters interact.A good European film for those looking for quality, not action.",Stealing Beauty
5,deloudelouvain,"Snooze fest, nothing happens ever...",3,16 June 2020,"The international cast looked interesting. That's basically what made me watching this movie. And that it was supposed to be a mystery. That said Stealing Beauty is a big disappointment. It's long, nothing happens during the entire movie, except some weird behavior for grown-ups ever now and then but if that's entertaining to some it sure wasn't to me. As for the mystery, well let's be honest there is almost none and if at the end you don't even get an answer to that I don't see the point of making a movie like this one. They're all good actors though but the story is so boring and pointless you will just be ending wasting your time with this one.",Stealing Beauty
6,Bored_Dragon,"""I didn't say the movie was good, but it's so beautiful""",7,12 April 2021,"Liv Tyler's first leading role was in a movie about a girl who, after mother's death, travels to Italy, to the property of mother's friends, in search of father and her own identity. After great movies such as ""Ultimo tango a Parigi"" and ""The Last Emperor"", not to mention the later masterpiece ""The Dreamers"", I expected much more from Bertolucci than the coming-of-age drama about a nineteen-year-old virgin, which brings nothing in terms of storytelling and plot, nor does it stand out as a study of personalities. However, ""Stealing Beauty"" has one indisputable quality. The film is visually excellent, and a perfect choice if you want to relax, rest your mind and feast your eyes on the beautiful landscapes of Tuscany.6,5/10.",Stealing Beauty
7,dwpollar,Marvelous coming-of-age story...,9,16 October 2005,"1st watched 10/15/2005, 9 out of 10(Dir-Bernardo Bertolucci): Marvelous coming-of-age story about a young woman named Lucy(played by Liv Tyler), returning to a place where her deceased mother spent a lot of time and rejuvenates some of the relationships she had four years prior while her mother was still alive. Bernardo Bertolucci again masterfully weaves this story in his usual poetically-visual style of directing. You feel like he's given everything he has and more to tell this story. It's told mainly from the main character's point of view, which is amazing in itself, but is possibly why the screenplay was written by a woman, Susan Minot. The story begins as Lucy arrives at her destination with a diary of her late mother's in hand. She reads thru this as a means to get to know her mother better(we get the feeling that she was not as close to her as she would have liked to be). The trip is also a way to explore this by getting to know her from the people who were close to her. The trip was the gift from her father, whom she has never met, and thus begins another search for her. Her virginity is also a hot topic, but mostly from those around her. She had only kissed a boy five years prior when she visited before and is still infatuated with him and hopes he will be the one(if you know what I mean). Since her mother's death she has closed herself up in many ways, and this has been one of them(although she denies this). Every character in this story is full of life in one way or another and seems to know their place in it except Lucy. And that's basically what this story is about. Her self discovery and her finding her place in the history of her family. The Italian landscape provides breathtaking views that Bertolucci takes great advantage of, the modern music blended with classical makes for an awesome soundtrack, and of course the storytelling plays it's way to a wonderful ending that leaves you again wanting to know these people more and more. This is where Bertolucci succeeds so well. His characters are rich and full of stories like real people who are merely here to enjoy their life. What a concept and what a film from a masterful director!!",Stealing Beauty
8,gcd70,Visual Beauty from Bertolucci,6,12 June 2010,"Is this movie about a young girl's search for the truth about her parents? Is it about her yearning to become a woman? Or is it just about sex? I'll leave it to you to decide.Liv Tyler is alluring as the young American who returns to Italy to delve into her mother's mysterious past. Jeremy Irons has little to do as her ailing British confidant, and extra support comes from Joseph Fiennes, Sinead Cusack, Rachel Weisz, Stefania Sandrelli, Jean Marais, D.W. Moffett and Donald McCann.Bertolucci's film, from his own original story, gets its strength from the visual. Art direction is inspired and cinematography is picturesque. Little else uplifts.Wednesday, April 26, 2000 - Video",Stealing Beauty
9,Galina_movie_fan,Summer in Tuscany,10,27 July 2012,"I loved Bernardo Bertolucci's movie ""Stealing Beauty"" (1996) when I saw it for the first time almost 15 years ago, and I remember how surprised I was to rather mixed and lukewarm reactions of some famous and respectable critics towards it. Many of them accused Stealing Beauty in what they called ""apparent self-indulgence, and lack of character development and drama."" I don't care about self-indulgence if it helps to create as beautiful and pleasing to all senses film as Stealing Beauty. And if the critics did not feel sweet gentle sadness from encountering the stealing beauty that one can't hold on to forever, I feel sorry for them.I re-watched the film recently and I loved it even more than first time. It has got some healing quality to it, it glows under Tuscany sun. It is filled with warmth, longing and bitter-sweetness.This must be one of my favorite movies about coming of age, about unforgettable moment in time that changes life of a young person forever and touches lives of all people around her. In the center of the film, there is Lucy, a 19 years old American girl, who came to Italy to spend the summer with the group of artists - friends of her mother while trying to come to terms with her mother's recent suicide and the secrets that she took with her. Lucy will learn more about people she thought she knew well and about herself. She will change forever during the unforgettable summer in Tuscany.Stealing Beauty is a European film in the best sense of the word. Leisurely paced, gorgeously shot, it looks in the faces of characters, in the beauty surrounding them, with interest and affection. This is a lovely film that celebrates life and beauty of youth, nature and Italy, Art and power of memory. This film reminds me another favorite of mine, ""Enchanting April"" (1992). Perhaps, because both movies have the same atmosphere, the similar scenery, the sun of Tuscany, and their effect on characters, and both are so delightfully and unabashedly romantic.Liv Tyler in her first big role lit the screen with her beauty and, charming awkwardness. She was very convincing as the girl hesitating to step over the border between adolescence and maturity. Lyv Tyler obviously was not an experienced actress at 19 but I don't think it was required of her. Lucy was natural and charming, innocent and curious, she was the center of the film, and her innocence, wholesomeness, insecurity and seriousness touched lives of everyone she spent that summer in Tuscany with. Watching Tyler simply move on screen is a cinematic pleasure. One second, the movements of her endless legs and arms are graceful and fluid, next - she is all angular impetuosity. She knew the effect of her luminous beauty on everyone but she was not quite sure how to deal with it.Besides Liv Tyler in the performance that made her a star, Jeremy Irons is also memorable as Alex Parrish. ""Stealing Beauty"" was the last feature film of the multi- talented, famous and beloved French actor, Jean Marais, mostly known for his collaboration with Jean Cocteau, Lucino Visconti and for many excellent film and stage performances.",Stealing Beauty
10,marcin_kukuczka,Tribute to lustful desires with addition of some art,4,9 May 2007,"Having seen some of Bernaldo Bertolucci's films, STEALING BEAUTY appears to me as rather a different work. Its content does not seem to offer much to a viewer who expects something ambitious. While seeing the movie, I must admit that I felt disappointed, sometimes even angry with the whole thing; yet, I don't deny that I liked some aspects of it. What surely remained in my memory after I gave a view to STEALING BEAUTY?First, it is definitely Liv Tyler. She is beautiful and sensual in the lead. Her character of Lucy is seemingly innocent, she is called ""a virgin"" since she waits and waits patiently to find the love of her life. When we see her through the first half of the movie, we discover her, get to know her similarly as we get to know someone in real life. It's like a sort of ""striptease of emotions."" Lucy's straightforwardness is conveyed in her love to her late mother, Sarah, who had once been to Tuscany before Lucy was born... However, her innocence is not that endless... The lusts and desires take over soon... But concerning Liv Tyler alone in this picture, she is really good and fits to the role. Unforgettable!Second, it is the dreamlike locations that you will not forget. Bertolucci, after his far away exotic movie journeys to China, Sahara Desert and Tibet, comes back to his homeland, to Italy and, more precisely to the beautiful Tuscany where, as many poets wrote, the sun shines more pleasantly, the hills bear a magical power and the people best understand the word ""Amore"" (Love). Yes, the movie can boast some romantic moments in the marvelous region with its olive trees, picturesque hills and almost heavenly colors.Third, it is for Jeremy Irons that you will not forget the film. He does a great job in the interesting and moving role of seriously ill Alex whom Lucy supplied with the ""incredible frivolity of the dying."" Irons does his best to express the desire to live, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, a change of heart forced by his cruel destiny. Alex is one of these people whom Lucy really trusts.But that is all that talks for the movie's value. If it weren't for the three above aspects, STEALING BEAUTY would be just a sheer waste of time, a film that has nothing to offer, that carries no good message. Its content is not ambitious at all; there are chaotic moments; the action is deadly predictable; there are weak performances, including Carlo Cecchi or Sinead Cusack. I also disliked the many vulgar scenes in which everything appears to be focused on lust and no feeling. As a matter of fact, the entire movie is about sexual desire, which occurs to be provocative, tempting, vulgar, sometimes even deviated. Lucy observes the people she meets, is fascinated by their making love to one another (consider the moment she finds Niccolo with a girl in the park). The final moment is one of the most erotically detailed scenes of cinema and excuses itself by the fact that it is meant to show the first love. A 19-year old virgin who at last takes a man! It is true that it is the first time for both, Lucy and her ""vacation lover"" but it cannot be called beauty or art. The moments the youngsters smoke marijuana are also vulgar and obscure. Moreover, music is nothing special in this movie, which disappointed me keeping in mind that it could have been so great. Actually, the film is about love affairs in Tuscany...Putting it in a nutshell, STEALING BEAUTY is not a film for everyone. People who know Bertolucci will be shocked by his ""difference"" here. Ambitious viewers will find it ""so so"" just average. People who want a movie to carry a message will leave the seat in disappointment. Yet, I don't discourage you to see it. There is some art around these lustful desires, the art of Liv Tyler's girlish beauty, the art of picturesque land of artists and the art of great acting by Jeremy Irons. 4/10",Stealing Beauty

12,mario_c,Simple but beautiful film from Bertolucci,8,31 May 2008,"Lucy (played by Liv Tyler) is a 19 American girl which travels to Italy after her mother die. She's coming back to a farmhouse where her mother lived once. It's not the first time she's going there, she had been there four years earlier, so she knows almost everyone in the house. She's young, she's beautiful, she's very attractive, but she's also very innocent and virgin. Every man in the house, from the older to younger, feel her presence and enjoy it, on one or another way, because she's everything but invisible. Her presence is really noticed, but she's not provocative at all. In fact she's very calm and shy. The entire plot is about her, her feelings, people which surround her, and the way she's growing as a woman. It's all that together what makes this movie so beautiful and intimate, because it's a portrait of the fears and hopes, disillusions and happiness, joy and anger of a teenage girl which is having some ""feelings"" for the very first time.I enjoyed the story but also the settings used, because it's all so peaceful and calm, it's all so quiet in that lost place somewhere in Italy The cinematography is beautiful and has this ""special touch"" European cinema use to have, with those little details which turn the movie so truthful and realistic. I like it a lot! About the acting I must say I enjoyed especially two characters and the respective actors who played them. They were the character ""Lucy"", played by Liv Taylor and ""Alex"", played by Jeremy Irons. It's especially those two characters which make this story so beautiful to me.To sum up, it's a simple but wonderful movie and another excellent work by Bernardo Bertolucci.",Stealing Beauty
13,osloj,Stealing Boredom,6,20 August 2001,"Bertolucci used to be a decent film maker, somewhere along the frame of his career he got pathetic and pretentious, this is probably related to his acceptance by middle class theater patrons and Hollywood flunkeys after he won the Academy for ""Last Emperor"". I think after he left his Marxist principles and communist leanings, his films sunk to a new time low. Take for example, ""Stealing Beauty"", this must be the most pretentious and bloated of his works. This film is almost unbearable to watch, it is dreadfully painful even. The characters are nothing but a bunch of spoiled, irreverent, upper middle class pseudo-intellectuals and artists who live out in an Italian country side. Liv Tyler plays Lucy, a sheepish, spoiled teen who wants to lose her virginity as if brushing her teeth. The problem is that Tyler can't act, nor can she pass off as an incredulous youth. She simply is annoying to the point of our exhaustion with her. One thing good to say about this ostentatiousness is the film cinematography and color which is in contrast to the dull and ridiculous story, and the revolting acting. In every role Jeremy Irons is in, he castigates us with his foreboding and absurdly patrician methods. I've never liked him in any film, and in this one he isn't any better, he mumbles around with diluted solecisms. What more is there to say about this unbearable tripe in excess?",Stealing Beauty
14,shanfloyd,"Erotic, but artistic.",7,27 July 2003,"The movie seemed mostly a brilliant portrayal of director and writer Bertolucci's erotic imagination, expressed in a highly artistic manner though. The picture was somehow very, very soothing towards our eyes and our minds. Lucy, a 19-year-old visits to the country house of Tuscany and becomes enough to light everyone's fire on, be it old writer Alex or young jerk Niccolo. The story centered around everyone's experiences and dreams around her, during her short visit. The ending was expected, but quite enjoyable. It was not the director's intention to offer any surprise. Rather he was to show us a much-known story, described slowly and only told in a different way.Liv Tyler as Lucy was ravishingly beautiful, and Bertolucci used her right. It was basically only her movie, everyone else is minor. Jeremy Irons also acted quite well. Rest of the cast wasn't bad either, except Rachel Weisz. Somehow she didn't quite fit into the whole thing. I would give it 7/10.",Stealing Beauty
15,TedMichaelMor,The Perfection of What It is.,8,7 July 2012,"Do we leer when we watch films by Bertolucci and Woody Allen? Do you leer? For all their supposed investigation of the celebration of nubile women by middle aged and old men, neither filmmaker quite convinces me that he has quite the interest in these young women that all the artifice, music, flowers, lovely scenery, and other settings suggest. I know that actresses report liking to work with Mr. Allen, as do actors. I am aware that we no longer make that gender distinction but humour me for a moment. Bertolucci has a reputation for pushing actors to full disclosure, as it were. No one discloses anything here.I just saw ""Stealing Beauty"" for the first time this week during the summer 2012. I find it implausible that a large household of odd mostly male characters would devote a summer contemplating the virginity of a girl. Leering defines, I suppose, a theme for a film as much as any other topic. The loss of virginity seems to me the theme of adolescent films but a bit too much and too little for a film filled with randy old men but these old men seem long past being randy while the young men mostly seem nascent old me without substance.Roger Ebert as usual pins this film in his review. Read it. The men, young and old, lack substance and the nubile girl never becomes a person. Woody Allen usually suggests that the object of desire is a human being and an engaging one at that. Bertolucci does not bother. I rate his film highly because here Bertolucci perfects his leering.",Stealing Beauty

17,98nurdinm-1,"Interesting, but slow.",4,9 March 2005,"""Stealing Beauty"" is an interesting film. In terms of film-making and the message of the film, it is very good, and probably excels some films on many different levels. However, in terms of the pace of the film, it is slow and generally boring on several occasions.Liv Tyler plays Lucy Harmon, a young virgin girl who visits friends of her late mother in Tusacny, Italy. These are an odd bunch, not least the chronically ill Alex (Jeremy Irons), who tells her not to give up on her search for her father. While she is there she also intends to sleep with the boy whom she shared her first kiss with and who she has been writing letters to. In the end, however, she makes a very interesting discovery about who has been sending replies.Liv Tyler is not really my favourite actress - I still feel damned after watching her gut-wrenching performance in ""Armageddon"" - but here she plays the character of Lucy brilliantly. She is sweet, virginal and intelligent enough to make you believe that not only will she succeed in her quest, but also she will not be pushed around by anyone, or taken advantage of. I was also impressed by the performance of Jermey Irons, whose rather obscure CV has taken him from ""Godspell"" to ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"". But here I warmed to his character, and the relationship between these two characters was played very well.But there are many parts of the film where you just have to sit back and realise that the scenery is the true star of the film. The beauty of the Tuscany countryside is breathtaking and a delight to watch. This does, however, seem to be played with a bit too much - we want to see a new chapter in Lucy's story, not some moving postcards that Bernado Betolucci, who directed, put in to make the film longer.This film will be remembered, however, not for the strength of the acting of some of the actors - incidentally, Sinead Cusack is also very good - but because of one or two risqué scenes. The final one of these is the ""climax"" if you will of Lucy's quest, and I must admit it was rather a touching scene to watch. But personally I feel the strength of the film is elsewhere, and not just with this one scene By the way, I am not ignoring the earlier risqué scene, where Lucy poses rather interestingly for a portrait, but then again I feel the strength does not lie here. It's reputation has been sadly built on these one or two scenes.In conclusion then, I would not recommend this film as something to watch with a partner or friend, unless you've been to Tuscany and want to reminisce.4/10",Stealing Beauty
18,terraplane,Beauty and a lot of beasts,6,7 February 2006,"There is beauty in this movie. The landscape, the light, the photography...but the people, oh the ugly people! A nastier bunch of lazy, hypocritical arseholes I've yet to see. Except for Jeremy Irons' character Alex, every one of them is a waste of space. The men sit around in the glorious Tuscan countryside moaning about their useless lives, hoping to de-flower Liv Tyler while the women drift around waiting on the men, knowing that the vapid Liv Tyler is hovering around like a mayfly, just waiting to be f****d. The men sniff around her like slavering, leering dogs on heat while she shows them her knickers and wafts clouds of pheromones in their direction, oblivious to the flames of lust (and possibly incest) she is fanning. How innocent she looks as she reveals her naked breasts for the artist, who isn't actually drawing her but intends making an ersatz Picasso-type sculpture from a lump of wood. Of course she has no idea that the artist just wants to see her tits and show her his idea of a good time. While she sits around waiting to be be de-flowered, she writes poetry on newspapers and then burns it. She writes ""I wait I wait so patiently I'm as quiet as a cup I hope you'll come and rattle me Quick! Come wake me up."" The only rattle she really wants to hear is from the bouncing rusty bed springs of course. That should wake her up pretty quickly. And of course she has no idea that every male in the villa is nursing an erection and wants to soak her in his gene pool. It's just a question of which one of these walking spermatazoa will reach the target first. In the end, she chooses the nice boy with morals and a conscience to lose her virginity with, and so ""become a woman"". How innocent, how beautiful, how unlikely. Not much of a story really, young virgin girl on holiday in Tuscany supposed to be having her portrait painted by a miserable bloke in a commune of middle aged bourgeois hippies. Or at least they would like to be hippies but they can't really be bothered. They smoke a lot of dope and talk a lot of rubbish. How do these people make enough money to be able to afford this beautiful Tuscan villa? They don't work, unless carving up logs with a chainsaw to make ugly sculptures is classed as work, they don't sell anything because all the ugly sculptures are scattered around the grounds of the villa, they don't DO anything except sit around all day. The art they make is ugly, the lives they lead are ugly and what they stand for is ugly. It's a shame really because there is some beauty in this movie. But too many beasts.",Stealing Beauty
19,rivera66_99,Deep or flat?,6,2 July 2001,"A question especially uneasy to answer in this case. The plot, of course, is very simple and even trivial: young girl loses her virginity and discovers her father's identity, gaining love and surrendering death (the never understood death of her mother), while her older admirer (Jeremy Irons) who only felt in love once - with her mother - gains love again but death at the same time. This pretty kitschy plot, together with the lack of movement in great part of the film, could make it unbearable. But it results much more ambivalent... First note that you wouldn't think at all you're dealing with a movie from 1996. Actually, when I saw it I had no idea from when it was and I estimated it to be from the late 1970's or early 80's. That has to do, above all, with the ethereal landscape-cinematography, this really magnific beauty of every movement the camera (and Liv Tyler!) make, but with the music, too. When there appears Mozart's clarinette concert, for the first time, while you see the field and the house sleeping ""siesta"", it can make you cry because of pure beauty you conceive... And there are many moments in this film, where music (timeless and time-switching) and picture make you feel so unsure about the era this film is telling about. ""Beauty hurts the heart"" says Jean Marais' character once. And actually, it does. The eroticism of this movie, for my taste, was sometimes almost painfully sad and joyful at once. Difficult to describe. Between, there are many occasions where you can find the vulgarity of the story just repelling, but then comes such a vigorous sequence again... It reminds me of some of the last Rohmer movies, in some respect, although it is much warmer and not that boring. (Rohmer's coolness, nevertheless, prevails him for falling in kitsch, something that Bertolucci doesn't avoid.) The movie, in some precious moments, does exactly do what its title promises: it steals pieces of beauty from this incredible world - but it has few awareness of it. Its explicitly ""deep"" parts are too immature and presumptious, but its superficiality contents a profoundness that convinced me. As a piece of art, I have to consider this movie too superficial, as a piece of "" just feeling"" (a word that I normally hate), I cannot let to like it. 6 of 10.",Stealing Beauty

Overall, this film is not great thematically or in terms of plot development.  But lord, is Liv Tyler a lovely young woman!In fact, the primary feature this film has going for it is its visual appeal.  There's plenty of beautiful people to ogle, and of course the Tuscan countryside is worth the price of admission by itself.  I'm an ""Italy-phile,"" so I'm inclined to look with favor upon anything that reminds me of that wonderful country.  Overall, Stealing Beauty is better than average, and at least it makes an attempt, however feeble, to discuss intelligently sex and sexuality.",Stealing Beauty

It's actually a very good movie and has gorgeous scenery and makes you want to go to Tuscany. There is a lot of nudity of both sexes. Gross. I'm not a prude, I just don't like seeing certain body parts on the big screen. Double gross. Liv Tyler is really beautiful, but I think it takes something away from a movie when you see people's giblets and gravy. I wish that all movies just cut away from that stuff-we know what they are going to do!Anyway, the best scenes are between Liv Tyler and Jeremy Irons. There are a couple of scenes that are very weird-must be very Italian. The best part of the entire movie, however, is the house, its gorgeous. Except the ugly statues everywhere.",Stealing Beauty
22,yawnmower1,much ado about nothing,3,27 February 2008,"To comprehend this empty, meaningless drivel, one must accept, as do the characters in it, the premise that Liv Tyler is a veritable goddess of love. Unfortunately, as she is stultifyingly dull, inane, superficial, selfish, coy, and vapid, this is impossible. God only knows why Bertolucci cast her in this role, surrounded by others who can actually act. Not even consummate pro Jeremy Irons can make his fascination with this simpering whiner sound sincere.The story is as banal as she is: teenage Lucy (Tyler) returns to Italy to lose her virginity, dreaming of a sexy young Italian she met at 13. She does not delight in the Tuscan landscape, study art, or learn Italian, which she insists on pronouncing with an excruciating American accent. Lucy lodges with a fatuous English sculpture and family who live the kind of 'bohemian' life only available to the idle rich. The boys are beautiful (young Joseph Fiennes is stunning) and, their hormones raging, are after just one thing.The only thoughtful character is a middle-aged man dying of AIDS (Irons). His inexplicable presence and predicament may have been the director's idea of adding 'weight' to this fluff. He and Lucy become friends, though one cannot grasp why. Perhaps she admires his ability speak in sentences that parse. Her utter self-absorption is forgotten for a moment as he is whisked away to die in a hospital. But as soon as the ambulance is out of sight, pretty, perky, pouty Lucy quickly comes to her senses and returns to the task at hand: giving it up.The only other American in the film is a thoroughly odious entertainment lawyer who, when not on the phone making deals, cheats on his wife at every turn. Being within earshot, she always catches him. He follows her around and grovels.But back to Lucy! She is a relentless tease and remorselessly leads on her paramour. When the time comes, however, she spurns him with one last shrill whine of consternation, and flounces out of the room leaving him decidedly 'blue'.Bertolucci must have been in love to have been this blind.",Stealing Beauty

24,misslv80,No beauty to steal,1,25 July 2003,"First of all, I am surprised why this movie was rated so highly. I was expecting something interesting and unusual in the storyline in this film, but I was very disappointed. Any ""beauty"" was I was expecting from this film was ""stolen"" away from me. I kept waiting for something important to happen, but it turned out to be long and boring. Liv Tyler plays a 19-year old girl named Lucy who travels to Italy to learn the identity of her father - but by the end of the movie I was too bored to tears to care - and lose her virginity, and no doubt she has all the guys more than willing to help her get rid of it. As if it were all that simple, right? Apparently, it was. I did not believe her ""performance"" at all. She acted like an old pro, not a shred of inexperience at all.I can't believe I watched this whole movie, and at the end, I was thinking, ""That's IT? What was the point of this?"" I kept waiting to see who would be the person Tyler would finally lose it with, but it was a big disappointment because it was with someone she barely knew and he was a minor, insignificant character that we are introduced to towards the end of the film. The sex scene was not erotic, it was annoying and unrealistic.The only interesting and redeeming character is the man dying of AIDS played by Jeremy Irons.

It is not sexy enough, not intimate, not engaging, just empty with a story that from the very beginning we already know about.

Bertolucci's brush strokes are wide, yet meticulously placed, leading us down a sensual and beautiful path of discovery. He packs a lot of plot into a week of story and two hours of film, but it is believable because many extraordinary things can happen in a short time frame  when one travels abroad.

If you're into the whole cinematography bit, then this is for you, but other than that skip it. The film revolves around who Liv Tyler will lose her virginity to.  Will it be Jeremy Irons (spare us the whole Lolita thing please!), a dumb adolesecent clod or another even dumber adolescent clod?  Who cares?

33,Alpenglo,'Io ballo da sola' é il migliore film bella mai...,10,26 June 1999,"'Stealing Beauty' is more aptly named with its American title, than its Italian one, 'I Dance Alone', for reasons both intentional, and not.  As is with most Bertolucci works, this film is more cinema than plot.One cannot argue that a visit to Tuscany, regardless of motive, is a wonderful experience.  Bertolucci has effectively captured the beauty of the Italian countryside, and brought it to the audience.  He has ""stolen beauty"", so to speak.  I believe the title speaks more of Lucy's portrait, though. ;o)Some films have made me think, or changed my way of thinking.  Some films have made me feel something.  However, no other film has caused me follow in its footsteps.  Being from Italy, but leaving as a very small child, this country has always been of both interest and personal mystery to me.  Not long after seeing 'Stealing Beauty', at age 20, I jetted off to Italy, and spent a wonderful few weeks with some old friends.If you're looking for 'splosions, or a story on the plot complexity level of 'Lost Highway', don't come looking here.  The Italian lifestyle is usually one that isn't so loud and rushed as one will find elsewhere.  The feeling you get from spending a day sitting in three places, dining, and sleeping in total peace just can't be explained.  However, Bernardo Bertolucci has harvested that feeling, and offers a little slice to all those who will accept it.  Woe to those who reject 'Stealing Beauty'.",Stealing Beauty
34,Littlegussy,"A beautiful, dream-like nothing of a film",6,6 January 2001,"Bertolucci films are always magnificent to look at. From the epic scenes of The Last Emperor to the claustrophobic bedroom in Last Tango, he is a film-maker whose mastery of visual language is immense. Stealing Beauty is no exception. Right from the start, the film has a dream-like beauty which reflects its 19-year-old protagonist, Lucy (played by the stunning Liv Tyler). Lucy is beautiful, naive, dreamy and still a virgin. Her mother's suicide prompts her to go to Italy to visit her parents' bohemian friends...There is nothing really wrong with this film but there isn't much to it either. The story is extremely slight, and even some good performances (particularly from Charles Dance as the dying man) can't save it from being slightly dull. It hints at some interesting themes - the way the post-AIDS generation is more hesitant about sex, how the past haunts the present - but does little with them. Instead, Bertolucci seems content to focus the camera on Tyler for most of the film, trying to intoxicate us with her breathtaking beauty to make us forget that there's nothing much here. This works for a while, aided greatly by the short summer dresses and some lovely scenery, but basically it can't carry the film through its entire length. Somewhere along the way I just got bored.If this happens to be on, you could do a lot worse, but it's definitely not worth a trip to the cinema to see - not even to the video shop, I don't think. Considering Bertolucci's pedigree, I had expected better from Stealing Beauty, but I suppose everyone has their off days. Average.",Stealing Beauty

37,cat_on_imdb,More of a travel log for Tuscany,5,2 March 2005,"""Stealing Beauty"" has noticeable flaws. We see throughout a good part of the film the director is bent on creating some kind of world where Lucy is this precious flower and dealing with unwanted advances by men. This plays no part really in the main plot; and I am not sure if Bertolucci did so to cater to the anti male bias American viewing audience (here in the States all men are considered pigs, rapists and gorillas by feminists and almost all forms of our media) or if there was any other reason, it is not apparent. Silly as it may sound, it's just that the time has come that people need to start to take a stance against seeing men depicted as scum of the Earth. It's also getting tiresome to see yet another flick with the plot focusing on the proverbial American princess [*BARF*]. The second flaw here is Lucy's character. We see this beautiful 19 year old girl as a complex deep thinking creature with introspective thoughts. The problem is her nationality: she is American. How many really pretty nineteen year old girls from the USA do any of you know who actually have an intellect of that portrayed like Lucy? None of course. Americans, both men and women in general are pretty shallow people and not very well educated, due to the great dumb-assing movement currently sweeping the U.S.. I know this, I am an American who has had the luck of being able to leave the States and study abroad, and experience a different life (thank God). Also, as one reviewer had written ""...really pretty American girls who's looks are in the same league as Liv Tyler would rather be in nightclubs sticking coke up their noses rather than be in Tuscany..."" though there are exceptions, I think that comment is generally true. Don't believe me? make a pilgrimage at ""Girls Gone Wild"" take a look at how chycks in America really behave. Real geniuses, yo! My girlfriend is in her early twenties, and is actually prettier than Tyler, and all I can say is that I am glad she is NOT American. I will say that Bertolucci does a great job with our sense of sight and music to create quintessential Italy. This is really what makes the movie. I would also recommend the soundtrack due to the interesting variety of songs from Grunge to Classical, which seem to work together as an album.",Stealing Beauty

Like the character Lucy, she didn't know her real father, she was raised by her mother and her boyfriend.  The other was not put on her bio. so I don't know.  I liked the plot because it sent a positive message to younger people.  I believe that you should wait till you're in love before you have sex (no I'm not catholic).  There is a lot of pressure to lose your virginity at a young age.  And Lucy, is determined not to be.  I like that. So even if people don't like the movie, actors, or whatever.

No, you watch Stealing Beauty at your leisure, sprawled over your armchair, supine,with a little smile on your face. You absorb it. It changes the world for you for a while afterwards, which is why it is best to watch it in the summer. You go out and appreciate the sun more, because you have that residual sense of viewing it all through Bertolucci's eyes. The film even manages to blend beauty with vulgarity so perfectly that it seems impossible to make a distinction between the two.

One review has stuck with me, for 12 years. ""Liv Tyler is the perfect piece of cardboard."" I don't remember who said that, but that line kept me from seeing this film. This film was offered for free on cable on-demand, and since then, I've watched several times. Probably about 20 times. Why do I keep watching it? Because details are revealed each and ever time I see it. Things that I didn't notice before. Liv Tyler gives a very subtle and masterful performance in this film. Her character is experiencing things internally, and it would be inappropriate for her to be wildly expressive. Her character is reacting to her surroundings, but her reactions fall under the radar of normal viewing. The opening scene is shot on (what looks like) digital video by a man on the plane from America to Italy. I didn't notice at first, but, there is a close-up of this man's wrist, wearing a leather bracelet. Fast forward several scenes and this close up of this same bracelet appears on the wrist of this character ""Carlo Liska""...and this leads me to believe that the man on the plane was this character ""Carlo."" But, back to Liv Tyler's character, ""Lucy""...this character is a virgin, but that doesn't make her unsophisticated. She speaks Italian, smokes marijuana, and (really forward-thinking for 1996) fearlessly allows a man - a character of a writer (probably dying from AIDS) played by Jeremy Irons, to dress an open, bleeding wound on her knee. AIDS isn't mentioned, but it is implied. Making the subject of sex (circa 1996) that much more shocking. This is a dangerous activity, according to the zeitgeist of the 1990s. Life and death. I like to have this film just playing in the background, because the music is pleasant, and it's pretty much like being on vacation in Tuscany. It isn't a demanding film. It doesn't scream at you. It meanders from beautiful shot to beautiful shot, and having seen it 20 times already, I can leave the room and come back and it's still like a vacation in Tuscany.

If Lucy existed, she could be the most sensual woman ever because she is sensual in the most powerful way: unconsciously. She seem even not to notice how beautiful she is and what effect she makes on people surrounding her... she is just too pure-hearted to notice it or to care about it. But in the meanwhile she's eager to discover life and she's hungry for love. She wants to try (as every teen) if love is what she had always imagined.A poem, a portrait, a music played by a 1000 instruments' orchestra could not be more expressive than this movie, perfectly directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. Maybe these three art-crafts together would be necessary to express what the movie tells us: it is a poem about life in all its various aspects, including friendship, love and death; it's a portrait of a bucolic scene in the wonderful Tuscany's countryside, with those wonderful locations making you wishful to spend there your whole life; and the beautiful soundtrack seems always the right music to describe the current scene and not just to accompany it.Bertolucci's camera seems to film the scenes accidentally, it is always one step aside from the scene, taking it from not too close, like he doesn't want to disturb the life of nature or the people, suddenly caught while living their lives.

Stealing Beauty might be considered a couple of different ideas rolled into one film. Ostensibly it is about Liv Tyler's coming of age, questions about her past and how that relates, etc. More importantly its a really touching example of how people relate to one another, in terms of lust, love, friendship and longevity. How do the older more cynical characters relate to this bright, beautiful, vivacious,confused, shy and above all YOUNG virgin? In turn how does that affect her expectations of herself. The supporting cast in this movie was phenomenal, and what might be considered ""side stories"" have as much to do with this film's impact as anything else. You probably won't walk away from this movie feeling as stunned as Fellini, Rosellini, or Visconti can make you. However, I find my thoughts constantly returning to the understated beauty and insight of this film especially as it relates to love, friendship and communication. There is a reason that Bertolucci is numbered among the greats of Italian cinema,and while this is certainly not his most sweeping, shocking, or controversial film you might find that it is the most personal.",Stealing Beauty

I found it dull, a random assembly of unlikely people gathered together in a house in Tuscany, the grounds of which were dotted with awful ""sculptures"", people entering scenes and dropping out, the whole generally going nowhere.The film didn't capture the beauty of the Tuscan countryside, it felt very detached from the film in my view, as if the characters had been plucked up and dropped down at this villa. Many of the characters I found stereotypical American or British (and Irish) and at the end of a tiring day, hoping for some spiritual refreshment, well I didn't get it from this film and frankly,I'd rather have had an early night.Liv Tyler looks beautiful (my boyfriend didn't think so) but that's about it.Not one to see again and this from someone who loves Italian cinema.",Stealing Beauty
51,knox1cm,This a true-to-life look at a woman discovering her own sexuality,10,13 October 1999,"This movie struck me as very powerful - and I usually don't enjoy ""chick flicks"" like this.  It is a very open and honest look at this girl, Lucy, figuring out who she is, and where she came from.  There isn't so much pretense to make it a better movie as many more commercial movies do. There isn't that period of unlikely events that cause interesting things to happen.  This is also a reason I think many people don't like it.  It's more realistic, in a whole of highly improbable, shoot-'em-up, blow-'em-up blockbusters (which are fine - don't get em wrong) that have led the movie going public to distrust a movie that feels real.  That is one of the truly great elements to this movie.",Stealing Beauty
52,i-got-away,A master work by a master director. Excellent!,10,30 May 2006,"I am a Bertolucci fan, and this film is one of the reasons why. I watch it again and again and never get tired of it. Don't be fooled by the 'losing virginity' theme; this film is about life, and death, and everything that happens in between. It's about what you seek and what you're willing to give up to get it.One of the best things about this film is that every character has a story, and an arc in the film, most of which is given by just one or two lines or shots in the film. For example, near the end of the film, Sinead Cusack's character slumps at the table after having taken an old friend to the hospital, probably for the last time. She says she misses England ""and rain, and milk that goes off"", and says that she's tired of looking after people. Then everyone starts coming in and asking about dinner, and she just gets up and opens the fridge. In less than a minute, we see into her life and character in a way that most films would take at least an act to explore. We even learn a lot about Lucy's mother (Lucy is played by a young Liv Tyler), even though she has died before the beginning of the film and never appears in it except in a photograph (also of Tyler).There is not a flaw in any of the performances. Never do we feel that these are people acting. They just feel like people, interacting, and we always have a feeling of their life leading up to the moments we see them, and they are interesting lives.The location itself is one of the characters, and it is beautifully shot, the colours saturated and rich. It feels like you can touch the stones, smell the air, feel the grass and flagstones beneath your bare feet. If you don't want to go to Tuscany after seeing this film, you are ill or on the wrong medication. The beauty that is being stolen, or that people want to steal, is not just the beauty of the young virgin on the hill, it is the beauty of life, of living, of learning, of looking back and finally giving it all up, knowing it cannot be stolen. I know that some people criticize Bertolucci for his aesthetic, for bringing the beauty out of every moment, even the horrible ones, and I say to those people that they live the life they choose.Finally, there is the soundtrack, which runs from alt-pop to classical to everything in between and works perfectly. It illuminates Lucy's internal reality and is true to the music that a girl of her age would have been listening to at that time, and it also helps set the scene and smooth transitions between scenes.This is a master work by a master director, and one of my favourite films of all time.",Stealing Beauty
53,thomas-794,"Clichéd ""Artistic Life""",3,10 May 2008,"I found the Artists-in-Tuscany concept to be a tiresome cliché throughout this film. So unrealistic and annoying to watch... Certainly a real artist would find it quite tedious to be distracted with so many house-guests and to have to entertain and feed all those awful people. We've seen this theme countless times now in film... a collection of ""free spirits""/""finding oneself"" in a gorgeous villa in Italy.There is not an ounce of honesty or any real characters in the film, just tired and worn-out clichés. Pretty, but meaningless.",Stealing Beauty
54,seasocks,Captivating and very sexy movie,10,24 October 2006,"Back when I watched this movie, I was astonished by the magic it portrayed. It caught you off guard with the sensuality that is managed throughout it, specially with the intimacy level you are able to trespass. The movie not only shares images with the audience, but also very personal thoughts that a lot of girls can relate to in a certain point in their life. I think I watched it in a moment where I could completely see myself in Lucy. I guess that is the main reason I was astounded by the very personal conflict she was in and the honesty in which it's handled. The is also a very slow and realistic timing to it, sometimes nothing really happens, like in real life. The director is apparently not just interested in making big events take place every second, he just lets it flow. He gives you time to think about the various situations and doesn't look to confound you. He allows some space for you to observe the different point of views and make up you own mind about yours. And that is part of the magic of it. I loved it.",Stealing Beauty
55,eber3-1,Beautiful scenery. Beautiful Liv Tyler.,2,30 December 2007,"Unfortunately the scenery and Liv's looks are the only things good about this film. Pointless plot and go nowhere characters. A day in the life of mundane artist hippies set in Italy. Story, what there is of one, seems to have been made up on the spot as the film was shot. No point to anything in the movie. Seems like the people who made this did it for no reason other then to state their views on sex, and display a vulgar European fetish. If you've always wanted to see Liv's breasts, or you love looking at the Italian countryside then this is the movie for you. Otherwise stay clear of this bore fest. I gave it a two instead of a one for one simple reason, there are worse movies... although it's hard to imagine when watching this.",Stealing Beauty
56,stick525,Beautiful story of a young girl searching for her father and love.,10,16 August 2008,"This is my favorite movie ever!!! Liv Tyler, Jeremy Irons, and the rest of the cast are excellent in this movie. The Tuscan scenery is gorgeous. It makes you wish you were there. I loved the story. The more you watch it the more you love it because you appreciate the surroundings, the music, the beautiful story. The only thing I had a hard time with was the beginning and how it related to the rest of the story. Also, I am usually not a fan of soundtracks, but the Stealing Beauty soundtrack is perfect!!!. I love the eclectic mix of music. The movie and the soundtrack deserve recognition. I can't believe how many people have not heard of this movie.",Stealing Beauty
57,jersbar,A beautiful film,10,10 March 2003,"I just saw this for the first time a little while ago and I thought it was one of the most beautiful films I have seen in a long time.  It captures all the aspects of life, the anger, elation, pain, and just being.  Liv Tyler was perfect for this movie because she can reach into her soul and bring out this perfect, virginal girl.  As I watched the first time, I did not pick up on everything, but the second time around, it was all rising action, leading to the end that amazed me in the innocence and beauty portrayed in the love between two people.  I found myself wishing that I was that beautiful girl on a trip to Italy, figuring out my past and controlling my sexuality.  I view this film as a work of art because of its perfect portrayal of love and the way it can sneak up behind us when it is standing right in front of us.",Stealing Beauty
58,orion1org,Blew Me away,10,26 July 2005,"This film blew me away. The hurt, love and pain expressed in this movie through the most simple forms of cinematography are amazing. A classical film of life and death, of love and pain. One of Liv Lylers best acting jobs. Again I agree that this is a film that maybe Americans won't really understand. Its very European in the way the individual characters interact. A must see for anyone who demands detail in a film. Its not just a love or romance film. Its about life in its purest form, about peoples imperfections and their desires. It brings out human nature as its over all theme. Once again, it blew me away. I haven't seen a film like this before.",Stealing Beauty
59,babzmasz2002,encapsulates peer pressure to engage in sexual intercourse,9,14 January 2006,"Everybody acts like it's ""the-end-of-the-world"" if you don't experience sex. Way not true-at least in the real world. We are seeing an emergence of virtue! Yes, v-i-r-g-i-n-i-t-y. Monk-like in nature! It's probably the most natural state-yet, we reject it in lieu of peer pressure- particularly the baby boomer's. Now, we understand, present company included, imagination is everything, and reality is nothing-well, next to nothing...nothing springs into something! That's our legacy, the cycle of life. I relate to the movie on many dimensions. In Tuscany, Italy, there are many secrets...just like there are where ever you go...",Stealing Beauty
60,zeklo,A Conformist' Tango: Stealing (dollars),2,4 January 2007,"""Stealing Beauty"" depicts (two hours of) Tuscany summer, slow paced drifting camera, a beautiful girl, lots of dark people around, candid sex, and pop music.Hey, Bertolucci... Slow down, take a deep breath, say ""no, thanks"" to the American audience, cry a little, and start again. I mean, from the very beginning.Remember: Pier Paolo and Michelangelo are contemplating you from above. And Godard says he wants you to show up in his next movie; ""Un Italiano is an Italian is an englishman"". Are you really sure you still want to make films? How about entering History, or Buhdist philosophy, for a change? Are you aware that your work as director here is as sordid as Marcello Clerici's life was?Reveille toi!",Stealing Beauty
