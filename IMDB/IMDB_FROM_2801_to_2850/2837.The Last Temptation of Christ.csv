0,TheLittleSongbird,Challenging but rewarding,8,15 January 2017,"Not one of Martin Scorsese's very best and not for everybody. However, while 'The Last Temptation of Christ' challenges the viewer and raises a lot of interesting and thought-provoking ideas it also highly rewards them with a real harrowing impact and emotional power.While it is easy to see why 'The Last Temptation of Christ' is controversial, I am with those who found nothing blasphemous or offensive about it. And have also been illuminated and convinced, and also thoroughly agree despite not being religious at all, by the reasons put forward by those who have defended it as to why. Am also of the opinion that the most controversial part of the film was the highlight of the film.'The Last Temptation of Christ' is not by all means perfect. It does go on for a little too long, and meanders in pacing at times especially in the middle third. There is a use of voice over narration too, and its somewhat surreal tone struck an odd, jarring note. Had mixed feelings on Harvey Keitel as Judas, it is a very interesting and remarkably complex interpretation (more so than most portrayals of Judas) and Keitel puts a lot of energy and emotional feeling into the character, but his appearance and accent does make him look and sound somewhat out of place.However, the arresting and richly powerful images, breath-taking and sometimes hard-hitting cinematography and evocative production values make for a film that is top-notch visually. Admired and appreciated the restraint but still constant engagement of Martin Scorsese's direction, while Peter Gabriel's score makes precisely the same impact as the crucifixion itself in wrenching the gut and moving to tears (particularly in the Crucifixion which is some of the most not only beautiful but truly powerful pieces of music of any film seen recently), one of the best scores to me for a Scorsese film.Scripting is very thought-provoking and was really bold in how much it challenged anybody watching, resisting the urge to ramble and it makes sense. The story does have pacing issues but benefits from a strong emotional core and characterisations that are far more complex than your scripture stereotypes (a very bold move and comes off wonders, in not showing characters as either entirely virtuous or jealousy/greed driven but ones that maintain the essence of how the characters are usually portrayed but with strengths and conflicts). The crucifixion scene is harrowing and heart-rending.Willem Dafoe is a sensitive yet commanding Jesus, one of the better and more complex portrayals on film, while Barbara Herschey is astonishing as Mary, being luminous, heartfelt but still with a backbone. David Bowie comes off surprisingly well, as immensely talented as he was expectations were for him to be as misplaced-feeling as Keitel but it is a subdued, down-to-earth yet frighteningly arrogant and menacingly ruthless depiction of Pontius Pilate. It is easy though also to overlook Harry Dean Stanton, but despite not being in the film long he does prove himself to be a scene stealer.Overall, challenging film but a rewarding one that is not to be dismissed due to the subject matter or the controversy. To me it is one of the better films and portrayals of Jesus and much better than the well made but pretty repulsive 'The Passion of the Christ'. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Last Temptation of Christ
1,Leofwine_draca,Powerful and compelling,6,17 January 2014,"Martin Scorsese's THE LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ is an undeniably powerful and compelling version of the story and, unsurprisingly given the director's tough films, one of the most controversial. However, I found the director's spin on what is a highly familiar story to be all the more effective because of the controversy.In fact, it's not QUITE as controversial as I had been led to believe, because for much of the time it's a fairly traditional retelling of Christ's last days on earth. Sure, the sex and violence are more explicit than in many a more family-oriented production (although this is relatively tame in comparison to Mel Gibson's later PASSION OF THE Christ) but the format is familiar.Much of the controversy stems from the last thirty-minute section in which Christ experiences a vision whilst on the cross of what his life would have been had he lived to old age. It's by far my favourite part of the movie, and a masterful way of exploring just what he gave up by sacrificing himself. Of course, it helps that Willem Dafoe gives a tremendous turn as Jesus, all repressed anger and pathos. All in all, this is a worthwhile effort and a must for fans of Biblical productions.",The Last Temptation of Christ
2,SnoopyStyle,controversial Martin Scorsese film,7,16 December 2014,"Jesus of Nazareth (Willem Dafoe) is conflicted by the voice in his head. He carves crosses for the Romans and is filled with self-hatred. His friend Judas Iscariot (Harvey Keitel) hates what Jesus does. He asks the prostitute Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey) for forgiveness. In the desert, he encounters snakes and purifies himself. Judas is sent to kill him but he stops. As a crowd starts stoning Magdalene for going with Romans on the sabbath, Jesus asks Who hasn't sinned? He starts to gather a following but Judas still questions him. Then he encounters John the Baptist.This starts with a surreal inner voice narration which gave it an odd tone. It meanders a bit and departs from the Gospels. Then it takes on the familiar stories but always with Jesus conflicted. It's a lot of personal struggle. In this version, Jesus is very human trying to come to terms with his doubts. It's sometimes interesting to see a different take on the Gospels. There is the main controversy about the alternate path at the end, but I consider it more like a dream sequence. It shouldn't really count.",The Last Temptation of Christ
3,gavin6942,"An Interesting Film, Though the Controversy is Hyped",8,30 January 2014,"The life of Jesus Christ (Willem Dafoe), his journey through life as he faces the struggles all humans do, and his final temptation on the cross.There are things I liked about this and things I did not. The idea of Jesus as a cross-maker was clever and it was an excellent twist. I loved the casting of Roberts Blossom. I loved the question: is the foundation the body or the soul? I even liked the interesting take on Paul, who could easily be said to be just as much an influence on Christianity as Jesus himself.I notice that Harvey Keitel's performance as Judas Iscariot earned him a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actor, and I agree. Keitel is a great actor and he works well with Scorsese, but I just felt he was out of place here. Sure, much of it was out of place in its own way, but Keitel was not convincing for me.Roger Ebert wrote that Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader ""paid Christ the compliment of taking him and his message seriously, and they have made a film that does not turn him into a garish, emasculated image from a religious postcard. Here he is flesh and blood, struggling, questioning, asking himself and his father which is the right way."" This is an excellent point. While the film may be offensive to some, it does raise the valid point that Jesus was (half) human and had the issues that humans have. To portray him as simply perfect is too easy.",The Last Temptation of Christ
4,lee_eisenberg,Who's a Christian now?,7,30 December 2005,"As an atheist, I'm not a person who really goes in for any portrayal of Jesus. Still, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" does an interesting job looking at him. We see Jesus (Willem Dafoe) as an imperfect human being with his own personal problems. Many Bible-thumping ideologues objected to this movie, due to its portrayal of Jesus' sexual life; all that I can say is ""If the guy didn't have sex, what would he have done?"" Now, the movie's weird aspect. Aside from the fact that ""Spiderman""'s Norman Osborne is playing Christ, Verna Bloom - aka Marion Wormer in ""Animal House"" - plays Mary, and Harvey Keitel plays Judas. All the Jews in the movie have American accents, while the Romans sound like Brits. But don't get me wrong; this is still a good movie. Maybe Martin Scorsese is an odd choice to direct a biblical epic, but whom do we want to do it? The biblical epics made in the '50s and '60s were boring as hell, and I heard that ""The Passion of the Christ"" was basically an anti-Semitic screed. My favorite biblical epic is ""Life of Brian"".Here's what I think that they should do. A movie version of the Bible hosted by Jon Stewart. The cast members are all Jewish-American entertainers. For example, Goldie Hawn and Woody Allen play Eve and Adam (for PC purposes, Eve comes first); they behave like a pair of tensed-up artistic people. Dustin Hoffman is Joseph (with the coat of many colors); when the Pharaoh's wife comes on to him, he says ""Mrs. Pharaoh, you're trying to seduce me, aren't you?"". Harrison Ford plays Moses; he splits the Red Sea with a light saber, and when he gets the Ten Commandments, it's done like the opening sequence in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Other cast members would include Carl and Rob Reiner, Mel Brooks, Gene Wilder, Elliott Gould, Barbra Streisand, Bette Midler, Billy Crystal, Kevin Kline, Richard Dreyfuss, ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, and others. At the end, Jon Stewart would say that the Bible was made into a movie...called ""Saturday Night Fever"". He would then walk down the street a la John Travolta while ""Stayin' Alive"" gets played, and go to a discotheque. Yes, the Bible would end in a discotheque. Call me crazy, but that would be my ideal Bible.",The Last Temptation of Christ
5,Quinoa1984,"Good work by Scorsese, very very good, almost sobering to the senses",10,10 July 2000,"Martin Scorsese takes the lessons learned by the likes of Rossellini, Pasolini, and in-between regarding religious pictures and makes one that appropriately makes it right. This time around, you don't necessarily have to be completely into Jesus or a Christian to see the heart and intelligence put into the material. Paul Schrader's script distills what must have been a mammoth book of ideas and stories from Kazantzakis and what's provided is obviously controversial. But its message is not layered with anything to insult the viewer's intelligence. There's real food for thought here, even for those who don't believe in myself (if anything, it shows Scorsese, in one of his five best films, showing the notion of making a difference in his other films sticks out great here). A little long, but never gets boring, and even features one of the all-time champion final shots in any film. And Willem Dafoe makes for a candidate for best Jesus in any film. One of the best films of 1988.",The Last Temptation of Christ
6,sunwarrior13,An Investigative And Fictional Film About Jesus Who Is Subject To Temptation And Sin,10,16 May 2014,"The Last Temptation of Christ is an film adaptation of the controversial novel of the same title by Nikos Kazantzakis.It is a fictional film that is not based on both the four Gospels and the portrayal of Jesus that is widely known to Christians. It stars Willem Dafoe as Jesus Christ together with Harvey Keitel,Barbara Hershey,David Bowie and Harry Dean Stanton.The screenplay was written by Paul Schrader and it was directed by Martin Scorsese.The film depicts the life of Jesus Christ and his struggles with various forms of temptation such as fear, doubt, depression, reluctance and lust.In other words,it explores Jesus as a human being who is subject to sin.In it,we get to see more of his physical nature and the struggles he had with it instead of his spiritual nature.We also get to see him apply the teachings he has given the Israelites during his time here on earth and his victorious conquest of the struggles of sin.Added to that,the themes of sin,guilt and redemption were explored in this fictional story with complete disregard to religious beliefs and dogma.It is worthy to mention Willen Dafoe did a moving portrayal of Jesus as a human being which made it effective in telling this fictional story.Also,the film should be credited for its honest and sincere search of truth especially as it investigates how Jesus himself would have dealt with sin,guilt and temptation.The final sequence of the movie was found both blasphemous and controversial by many Christians all over the world as it shows the Jesus,while crucified on the cross,being tempted by Satan.He then experiences a hallucination wherein he comes down from the cross, gets married with Mary Magdalene and lives a life of that of ordinary man.But later,he asked for God's forgiveness and accept him once again as God's only son upon knowing the mistake that he has made.Additional scenes were also shown wherein Jesus is overwhelmed by guilt due to the sins he had committed.While these scenes have made Christians protest and have fought for the film to be banned in some Christian countries, Scorscese's film provides the viewer a form of investigation especially with regards to how Jesus,who is perceived to be a perfect human being,would have reacted to the same situations that we undergo in life.If the viewer put an open mind while seeing this film and putting aside his/her religious beliefs particularly Christians,one would appreciate a great,moving and honest film about Jesus during his life here on earth if he was subject to the same conditions of an ordinary man particularly temptation,sin and guilt.",The Last Temptation of Christ
7,Theo Robertson,Irritating Mixture Of Good And Bad,6,17 March 2005,"THE LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ is a very irritating mixture of both good and bad . When I say this I don't mean a sophisticated subtext of both good and bad being in the souls of man , I mean good film making and bad film making The Good : Scorsese is a master craftsman and he's trying to make a film that is different from his previous resume . As can be expected the technical aspects like editing , cinematography and score whilst not being outstanding do rise above average . Scorsese casts well and Willem Defoe playing Jesus is an inspired choice as is Romans with British accents and Jews with American accents . The early part of the story where there's a Zionist rebellion and Jesus making crucification crosses for the Roman invaders is something you won't find in the bible but sticks in the mind as does the revisionary biblical scenes The Bad : Despite being different from anything he'd done before there are signs of the flaws that would become criticised for in the 1990s . One is that the movie is just too long , a criticism that can be levelled to CASINO and GANGS OF NEW YORK with some of the story lacking an essential drive . Are all the scenes with people standing around talking all that necessary ? Not as good as that Monty Python film but at least no one claims it's a true story",The Last Temptation of Christ
8,lastliberal,It is accomplished!,8,15 June 2007,"How could I not like this movie based on the superlative novel by Nikos Kazantzakis? Besides being a great film, it has so many of my favorites.Staring with the director, Martin Scorsese, who did this just before Goodfellas. I can imagine that he took a lot of heat for this film, which depicts Jesus (Willem Dafoe) doing things that we all do, like getting married, and making explicit and sensual, but not pornographic love with the luscious Barbara Hershey (with tattoos and lots of mascara) as Mary Magdalene. Do you think The Davinci Code was right? here is the evidence.Harvey Keitel, another favorite, was especially great as Judas; I just like seeing him act. And, David Bowie as Pontius Pilate. Who thought up that one? He was magnificent! This is no sappy Christ picture. It is harsh and real and angry. Christ is depicted with a rabble-rousing fervor. He has doubts and doesn't feel that he is worthy. He even steps down from his mission to raise a family. You have to look at this with an open mind and still it may be hard to take. In this film, Christ not above us, and above our weaknesses, but on a level with us, and prone to the same doubts and temptations.With lots of blood and Peter Gabriel's music, the film is a feast for the senses.",The Last Temptation of Christ
9,Boba_Fett1138,"Christ, the man of flesh and blood.",8,28 October 2005,"Whenever I watch this movie I have the feeling that it's closer to the truth than for instance a movie like ""The Passion of the Christ"". This movie feels more realistic, mainly because of the way the Jesus character is portrayed in this movie and overall the movie and its story feels far more believable. In the movie Jesus is portrayed as the son of God but as a human of flesh and blood as well. He has hopes, feelings and dreams like every other man.The story is absolutely fascinating. It's a whole different take on the life of Jesus and the person as well. Lot's of things of the famous story have been changed to a more believable and likely story, without too many supernatural elements but with lots of personal struggles and doubts from Jesus about his mission.Jesus is beautifully portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Also good in their roles were Harvey Keitel as Judas-, this movie also provides a totally different view on his character, and David Bowie as Pontius Pilate, in a much smaller role than you would expect from his character.The movie is filled with some unforgettable, original and though provoking moments, especially towards the ending when Christ gets his 'last temptation'. It clearly is not a movie for just everyone. Obviously there will be still lots of people who will be offended by the portrayal of Christ and many other different characters from this movie. But also because the movie is quite artistic and almost poetic like at times in its thought provoking moments, it might be a movie that will simply seem 'odd' to some. So clearly not a movie for just everyone. Still I want to recommend it to everyone so everyone can form their own opinion about the movie its story and characters afterward. Whether you like this movie as a movie, or not, isn't the most important thing. It's the way you feel about the story and the character of Jesus that matters the most afterward. I think this is also what the filmmakers tried to achieve with this movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Last Temptation of Christ
10,evanston_dad,"As Usual, the Protesters Got It Wrong",7,27 July 2008,"As is typical with religious-themed movies, the broo-ha that greeted Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" was completely unnecessary. The controversy all stemmed around the film's last 30 minutes or so, when Jesus imagines what it would be like to skip out on the crucifixion scene and live the life of a normal man. I don't know what everyone got so hot and bothered about -- though I'm no Bible expert, wasn't the whole point of Christ's story that he suffered the same pains and was tempted by the same sins as mankind so that his sacrifice meant something? Well, whatever. As a movie, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is pretty good, and yet further evidence that though Scorsese is known for gangster movies, he's a quite versatile director. It's probably a little too long, and a tad sluggish, but it's well acted and directed, and well worth watching, whether you're religious or not.Grade: A-",The Last Temptation of Christ
11,The_Void,"Flawed, interesting and controversial account of the life of Jesus Christ",7,18 August 2005,"It's well documented how Martin Scorsese toiled to get this film made. I'm sure that before, and during the filming of The Last Temptation of Christ; the highly acclaimed director thought that this was going to be his masterpiece, but, of course, it hasn't gone down as such. The film does suffer from several flaws, and while much of it is very good; it cannot be seen as one of Scorsese's crowning achievements because the flaws bring it down. I'm not a massive fan of crime films, and so I don't consider Martin Scorsese to be one of my favourite directors. It's a shame that so much of his repertoire is in the crime genre because when he's stepped out of it, the results tend to be quite good. Rather than making a film about the 'classic' story of Christ, Scorsese has opted to base the film on the writing of Nikos Kazantzakis, from his book 'The Last Temptation of Christ'. This story follows Christ as a much less admirable character, and we see him as he leads his disciples to Jerusalem. Jesus is tormented by the fact that he is the Son of God, and the story ultimately comes to him trying to resist the temptation of living the life of a normal man.Like all films dealing with Christianity, this one is controversial and has, and no doubt will continue to, annoy people. The Passion of the Christ had the Christian church up in arms in 2004, but that was controversial for a different reason. Mel Gibson's film depicted an unrelenting account of Jesus' torture and racial controversy over the saviour's murderers; but Scorsese's film is arguably even more potent in terms of controversy as it strikes straight at the jugular of Christian ideology. Rather than being violent or racist, Scorsese's film attempts to defile the entire belief system surrounding Jesus, and presents Christ as more of a cult leader than the great saviour. Scorsese goes a bit over the top with the music at times, which can be irritating and William Dafoe, while no doubt a great actor, doesn't quite do the role justice here. His persona fits the personality that this story has given Jesus, but the actor just doesn't fit the figure and it doesn't come off very well. Harvey Kietel co-stars in the movie as Judas, and it feels like we're watching him in one of Scorsese's crime flicks for most of the movie. In spite of it's flaws, however, The Last Temptation is an interesting film and well worth seeing. Just don't go into it expecting greatness.",The Last Temptation of Christ
12,namashi_1,A Masterstroke!,10,5 August 2013,"A film adaptation of the controversial 1953 novel of the same name by Nikos Kazantzakis, Martin Scorsese's 'The Last Temptation of Christ' is a deeply moving film, that attempts to make Christ human, which he was. 'The Last Temptation of Christ' depicts the life of Jesus Christ & his struggle with various forms of temptation including fear, doubt, depression, reluctance and lust.When I watched 'The Last Temptation of Christ' a few years back, I wasn't effected or moved by it. But when I thought about the film in detail, I felt emotional & deeply engaged. Scorsese has delivered some of the great films in cinema & 'The Last Temptation of Christ' ranks amongst his bravest films to date. He Directs the film amazingly. A special mention for the splendid Cinematography by Michael Ballhaus. Performance-Wise: Willem Dafoe as Jesus Christ, delivers a terrific performance. Harvey Keitel as Judas Iscariot, is slightly over-the-top. But its Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene, who steals the show with an astonishing performance. On the whole, 'The Last Temptation of Christ' left me awe-struck.",The Last Temptation of Christ
13,StevePulaski,"Not faithful, human",9,13 January 2015,"I have been planning to watch Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ ever since I chose to watch Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ back in March 2012, just in time for Easter. However, after the latter film left me so numb, I thought it was best to leave films dealing with religion and Jesus Christ dormant for a while due to that film being so heavy and jarring in its depictions of violence and graphic content. I made the wise decision, for a college course I'm currently enrolled in called ""religion and ethics in film"" has kicked off by showing The Last Temptation of Christ in its entirety, allowing free-form discussion and conversation to take place regarding its allegedly ""blasphemous"" depictions of Jesus Christ and the gospels along with its radically unconventional approach to biblical characters.Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader create the most original works involving our Lord and Savior that I, and undoubtedly countless others, have ever seen. The film involves Jesus Christ (played by Willem Dafoe) as a man entirely unsure of himself and his own ability to be the strong, reliant son of God. The film opens showing Jesus Christ making crosses for the Romans to crucify Jews on, already kicking off the film on a note of complete shock to anyone who has read and studied the gospels. In the film, Jesus is close friends with Judas Iscariot (Harvey Keitel), who deviates from his role in The Bible dramatically to frequently challenge and question the motivations of Jesus Christ while simultaneously trying to believe he is the noble messiah that is to be trusted and followed. Finally, there's the third central character of the film, Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey), who has turned to prostitution following Jesus's rejection of her offers of fulfilling his sexual desires.Throughout the film, Jesus is tempted by many things, such as doubt, depression, uncertainty, fear, and lust, prompting visions of carrying out sexual desires with women. Initially, any devout or simply practicing Christian will look at The Last Temptation with an understandable uneasiness about such narrative inclusions like Jesus carrying out sexual desires, or even being uncertain and fearful of his taxing responsibility to carry out the word of God. Your response to such ideas is dependent on how open you are about hearing a different, pragmatic take on the life of Jesus Christ rather than the frequently institutionalized, dehumanized version of the messiah.We see Jesus Christ not as a holier-than-thou messiah, or a bold and confident individual, sure of the gospel and his duty granted by an almighty god, but instead, a deeply bashful, neurotic soul, grappling with the idea of being both one-hundred percent man and one-hundred percent God. As a result, we get perhaps the most human (notice I didn't say ""faithful"") adaptation of Jesus Christ ever put to film, one that doesn't blind us with the glow of his metaphorical halo and holiness and one that doesn't resort to caricaturing. Despite taking massive creative liberties, Scorsese and Schrader seem to have a great deal of respect for the messiah, as they care about him enough to give him an identity beyond institutionalized scriptures and sloganeering.Furthermore, the humanization of Christ allows Christians to see their Lord and Savior in a light they likely hadn't previously thought of because of such sloganeering. It's strange and unconventional to see a leader be portrayed as bashful and doubtful in himself, but such feelings were likely to be felt by Jesus in at least some manner. Imagine existing as both a man and a god of some kind, burdened by the dictation of a higher power you, yourself, didn't understand, who wanted you to preach the gospel to many who would hate or doubt you, effectively preventing you from carrying out any relationships of your own and grappling with your own sanity? The fact is you cannot imagine it because it's too overwhelming to even conceptualize; it's not of this natural world.Regardless of how you want to view The Last Temptation of Christ, one cannot deny its ability to provoke some kind of feeling between believers and non-believers. It's a film that sits with you, unnerves you, and plays with your emotions in the best possible way. When it was over, the class I was surrounded by was surprisingly vocal, many of whom either shocked about the Jesus Christ they saw or maturely criticizing what they had seen unfold. One woman even said the film was dangerous because it has the potential to give someone unfamiliar with the gospel a completely different and ""false"" idea of Christ. I sat back and listened in silence, as I was processing what I just saw, uncertain but confident I witnessed the closest thing to a cinematic miracle I have yet to see; a film with enough gall to reject convention and paint one of the oldest known stories with brushstrokes that weren't broad but specific and clear.Read the full, more complete review on my personal website, http://tinyurl.com/qfeayhj",The Last Temptation of Christ
14,MovieAddict2016,Not imperfect but entertaining nonetheless,7,29 April 2005,"I grew up in a Christian household and ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" was considered sacrilege. It was not until I began a fascination with Martin Scorsese's movies that I stayed up late to watch this one night on television, to see if the controversy surrounding it was appropriate or not.If you've read ""The Da Vinci Code"" you're already familiar with the concept: that Jesus Christ (played here by Willem Dafoe) was more flesh and bones than we given Him credit for, and was tempted to betray God and live with His true love, Mary Magdalene, rather than die for our sins. This is referenced by Dan Brown in the overlong and silly 20-page explanation of the true ""Holy Grail"" -- who Brown proposes is not an object, but a living person: Mary Magdalene, whom Jesus impregnated.The Catholic Church took an immediate disliking to this concept. As Scorsese's film not-so-subtly implies that this is the case, it was panned and, in some cases, banned; the Church called it sacrilegious and many people refused to even see it, just based on its subject matter.Robert De Niro turned down the lead role of Jesus in ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" and probably because he was aware of the controversy it would stir. It was one of the only roles Scorsese offered him that he has turned down, the other being ""The Butcher"" in ""Gangs of New York."" Although ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is made with some insight and Scorsese suffered trials and tribulations to bring it to the screen, I'd say it's one of the lesser efforts of Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader's combined efforts.The film is interesting but the acting is a bit off. I remember one sequence where Harvey Keitel (playing Judas) beats Jesus and Jesus lowers to Judas' feet and begs forgiveness. It all seems a bit hokey and staged, and Harvey Keitel is out-of-place, wearing what looks to be a very odd replica of the era's clothing.The movie is based on a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, whose work was complete fiction, as the author himself has claimed. As a result Scorsese's work is not claiming to be an accurate depiction of Christ's death, but rather a new twist to the tale based on another book.Do I think this is wrong? To be honest, yes, I do. On one hand I consider a fresh perspective refreshing, but on the other hand it seems wrong to base anything off of religious iconography and attempt to twist it into something human.Scorsese had to knew what he'd endure to release this. I don't think it was a surprise.But enough about the controversy. Purely as a film, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is beautiful to look at but I do feel some of it is rather hokey. As I mentioned above, some of the acting seems misplaced. Mel's version is definitely the more realistic of the two.But if you do have a (very) open mind and are not religious you might enjoy this. If you are religious and have a closed mind about your faith, stay away from this and ""The Da Vinci Code"" as they'll both probably just upset you and cause stress.In my opinion ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is a good movie, but I do understand why people were outraged (and I rarely do with films) because Scorsese is touching on a very fragile subject matter here and it would have been quite naive of him to expect people to love his film. I like to think that he was smart enough to foresee the hatred for this movie. I'm pretty sure he knew.",The Last Temptation of Christ
15,lasttimeisaw,Religious epic is not a winning formula for Mr. Scorsese in spite of his own fondness,7,16 January 2017,"In anticipation of Martin Scorsese's SILENCE (2016), it is tempting to visit the other religious passion project from his backlist, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ, an adaptation of Nikos Kazantzakis' titular novel, a mini-scaled, semi-improvised, shoe-strung budgeted (a mere $7 million considering its epic 162 minutes length) mortal exposition of the divine sacrifice. Shot in Morocco against a biblical but spartan context, it takes some time to acclimate ourselves with the cast's American English accent, a sense of ""they don't belong to that land"", which doesn't peter away as the story lumbers on. Willem Dafoe is the son of God, exerts an assiduous endeavor into this taxing challenge which forces his hand to feign wide-eyed gaze, conflicted frown and plangent oration in spite of his vampiric astuteness, he is too contemporary for the role, so is Harvey Keitel's curly ginger-haired Judah, more often than not, it pulls audience out of the context unconsciously, whereas Barbara Hershey's Magdalene, suffers less from this obstacle thanks to her exotic fripperies, a subdued position in the story (less wordy) and her mystical but heroic make-up, an unabashed prostitute has no racial bias of her clientele. Encumbered by its monetary constraint, the film doesn't endow audience with the imaginably breathtaking desert landscape, where Jesus goes alone to seek his true vocation from God and he has to ward off temptations from a talking cobra, an august lion and the flame embodied by Satan, those symbolic vignettes are slam-bang on the nose, but as re-enactments of transcendent design, they are ruefully pedestrian in its artistic form, so is the didactic sequences where he conducts miracles, as blasé as Jesus' human foibles. With regard to the last temptation, adheres to Kazantzakis' urtext, the story posits an alternative for Jesus, what if he is not the chosen one and he is blessed to live as an ordinary human being, getting married, conducting promiscuity and procreating children until reaching his dotage when he realizes all is a sham (thanks to a forthright Judas), concocted by Satan in the disguise of his guardian angel, to lead him astray from his destiny, yet, it is never too late, because all is in God's design, he will return to the cross and consummate his crucifixion. And that's it, a digression into an non-existent life (The only thorny part is his confrontation with apostle Paul, played by a sprightly Harry Dean Stanton, who gives a truth-revealing address about the crux of religion: truth doesn't matter, religion is created to appease the needy mass.) crops up to be just a coup d'oeil on the cross, a miracle conjured by the Almighty to harden J.C.'s dithering resolution and squash his doubts. No one can deny, that could be a very dialectical approach to prove God's existence, only it is inconveniently buttressed by a far too earthly hypothesis borne out of fancifulness. If such an omnipotent being indeed exists, the only way to worship and follow God is the ever-consuming blind faith in lieu of any normal sense mankind possesses, because God is so transcendent and superior to humans, otherwise he cannot be the creator, however, that kind of devotion is not applicable to everyone, because we are a species of cynical and dubious nature, incorrigibly self- centred and restlessly combative. Unimpressed by the film's overtly orthodox and reductive tack to seize upon its contentious content, one might feel prone to luxuriate in a compensatory reward, Peter Gabriel's enigmatic incidental music, wonderfully encapsulates the otherworldly rhythm and vibe clearly the film doesn't fully manage to elicit. Religious epic is not a winning formula for Mr. Scorsese in spite of his own fondness, but it is his prerogative to materialise his dreams just because he is able to afford it, for viewers who hasn't seen SILENCE, it is wiser to lower our expectation in exchange for a less bathetic experience, which is all but imminent.",The Last Temptation of Christ
16,sddavis63,An Extraordinarily Powerful Presentation Of A Familiar Story,10,3 May 2008,"If memory serves, this movie stirred great anger among the fundamentalist Christian community when it was released (and, presumably, still does.) As an aside to those who like to caricature Christians, it might be worth noting that fundamentalist Christians represent only a small portion of those who would claim the name ""Christian,"" but they do get a disproportionate amount of attention - as do ultra-liberal Christians for that matter. As a Christian (non-fundamentalist, non ultra-liberal, non-extremist and quite mainstream; as one who accepts both the divinity and sacrifice of Jesus and the truth of the Scriptures) I found this movie to be both quite moving and very challenging. As is pointed out in a disclaimer at the movie's beginning, the story is not based on the Gospels (except very loosely in the sense that many of the scenes in the Gospels are included, up to and including the crucifixion) but rather is a representation of the spiritual journey of Nikos Kazantzakis, the writer of the novel on which this movie is based. The most controversial part of the movie is probably the last half hour or so, in which Jesus is depicted as a man living in intimate relationship with two women (both Mary and Martha - the sisters of Lazarus) with children and (eventually) grandchildren, living a comfortable and happy life. What the critics seem to have missed is that this was - as the title implies - Satan's last temptation to Jesus, in a desperate attempt to get him off the cross - a futile attempt in the end, as Jesus is clearly portrayed as having overcome the temptation. ""It is accomplished,"" he cries from the cross. Some argue that this shouldn't have tempted Jesus, because Jesus as divine was therefore perfect. But theologically, Jesus' perfection rests on his ability to overcome temptation, not to avoid it. Why would this last temptation be any more offensive than any other temptation - such as Satan offered him in the wilderness. Of course Jesus could be tempted. Of course, Jesus could have succumbed to temptation - otherwise the biblical accounts of Jesus being tempted in the wilderness are pointless. The perfection of Jesus is displayed in his choosing not to give in to temptation when he could have chosen to give in to temptation.The portrayal of Jesus in the first two hours of the movie might have caused some angst - portraying, as it does, a confused and fearful Jesus, struggling with God's call and uncertain how to proceed. (Although Luke's Gospel does affirm that Jesus had to ""grow in wisdom."") Hats off to Willem Dafoe for his portrayal of Jesus. I've never really been a huge fan of Dafoe, but thought he nailed this part perfectly - perhaps the best film portrayal of Jesus I've seen. Harvey Keitel presented an equally fascinating portrayal of Judas Iscariot, who is, in a sense, the ""hero"" of this movie in that he's the one who, in the end, jolts Jesus out of the temptation and back to reality. Another performance worth mentioning is that of Juliette Caton - the young actress who portrayed Satan pretending to be Jesus' guardian angel sent to take him off the cross. She was quite good in the role (and presented, to me, a convincing portrayal of Satan - unthreatening, innocent, concerned.) I've never seen her in anything else, but based on this one performance, I'm surprised her acting career doesn't seem to have gone much farther.What more is to say. It's interesting to compare this to ""The Passion Of The Christ,"" a movie that also aroused deep feelings both for and against. I liked ""Passion."" I thought it was a very well done account of the crucifixion, which is what it was meant to portray. I have to say, though, that I thought ""Last Temptation"" was better. It's a superb movie that both challenges and deepens faith. It's a superb movie that flies by and that keeps you glued to the screen from start to finish. If ""Passion"" is a 9 - which I voted it - then ""Last Temptation"" has to be a 10. It's the superior movie.",The Last Temptation of Christ
17,ElMaruecan82,A soul-opening experience...,10,28 December 2011,"There's no salvation without pain for there's no redemption without guilt and no guilt without sin, so pain is simply the punishment inversely proportional to the delight induced by the temptation, and the bigger is the sin, the harder is the redemption. And to bring salvation for all mankind, no one endured a greater pain than Jesus of Nazareth.His body was flogged; his head carried the infamous crown of thorns and his body, naked as when he came out of his mother's womb, was sweating thin streams of blood and to the pain's atrocity was tied the humiliation of stones, spits, insults from an angry but unconscious mob, the betrayal from his own. One would imagine that the Son of God, the divine Icon immortalized in churches, would undergo the ultimate pain of crucifixion with a holy majesty, but in ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", Jesus is all flesh and blood, extraordinarily played by Willem Dafoe, he's human in the most painful meaning of the word, and at the crucial moment, as if he stopped incarnating God on Earth, he embodied our miserable vulnerability.""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"" cries out Jesus of Nazareth on his cross. This is the agony of a soul unjustly abandoned by his father, and as a capricious reaction, abandons his divine power to succumb to the last temptation of being a human. Jesus' weakness works as a double-edged sword, feeling both the weight of his responsibility, and renouncing to it, or being strong enough to resist the temptation, then transcending the organic sensation of pain into the necessary sacrifice that would lead to mankind's redemption. Martin Scorsese' controversial film chronicles the insupportable duality that tortured Jesus' heart, with a combination of iconoclast intelligence and thought-provoking direction, with a genius emotional core hidden behind its heretic surface.No other director than Martin Scorsese has acquired such talent to depict the ravaged effects of guilt on a tortured soul, starting with what I consider his first masterpiece ""Mean Streets"". Charlie (Harvey Keitel) believed that no one could make up for his sins in church; it had to be done on the streets. I guess Marty was a man of action who despised bigotry and redemption, like sins could only be made of actions, no passive introspections or deep meditations. In ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", Jesus' prayers are never detached from the reality of his world; he also is a man of action, plenty aware that God has plans for him. The roots of his torment are that he ignores about the plan, he's a shepherd without a stick, he's a guide lost between two worlds, Earth and Heaven, sins and temptations, grace and divinity.Scorsese direction manages captures the essence of these two realities' coexisting in the soul of a revolutionary man. Jesus is also a leader, followed with a zealous enthusiasm by his disciples, and his most devoted supporter and closest companion happens to be Judas Iscariot, played by Harvey Keitel. Judas represents the dubious side of humanity: his mission was to kill Jesus as a traitor of the Jews, but he's eventually convinced that he's the Messiah. The tragedy of Jesus' divinity is that it ignites more passion than it extinguish, starting with his ferocious desire to show the light, to fight the evil and the moral corruption that contaminated the world. But when carrying an ax and about to succumb to violence, his hands bleed communicating the uselessness of violence. Jesus cannot fight like men and only his sacrifice would consecrate his divinity and bring the salvation.This acceptance of death is our both Scorsese and our inspiration. Jesus becomes is a man of life, who feels, shouts, drinks, loves and dances, the ambiguity of his relationship with Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey) progressively draws a line of uncertainty between passion and compassion. Jesus' passion is what both drives his desire to save mankind and what deprives his soul from the divine detachment. Jesus' duality is something that is not taken for granted; it's experienced when Jesus and Judah debates the importance of the soul and the body, and when Jesus' own faith wavers as to depict faith as a malleable, a living form that can rely on monolithic and impenetrable dogmas, the same that attacked the film and literally killed its success.Jesus' soul is often lured by Satan, through the form of a lion, a cobra and ultimately, a little girl who'll convince him to renounce the crucifixion and the film' genius is reached during the alternate reality sequence featuring a Jesus who rejected his duty and surrendered to Satan by choosing to live normally, have children and wives and die peacefully. It's the climactic pay-off of an outstanding beginning, and it works as an inconvenient reality. When Paul preaches the crucifixion's message because and Jesus objects that one can't build anything on lies, it doesn't matter for Paul as long as people listen. But the point is that no salvation can be based on abstractions, one must experience it, and the ultimate punishment comes from the mouth of an older Judas who shouts to Jesus that he betrayed them when he stopped acting like the Messiah, an intolerable reality. Then Jesus implores God to take him back on the cross, his fate and the price for men's salvation and the accomplished miracle leaves a heartbreaking smile in Jesus' ecstatic face, and the rest is history""The Last Temptation of Christ"" echoes the cathartic effect of necessary pains in our quest for redemption, the quest of lifetimes, but one could never have the courage to renounce temptations and experience redemption through self-punishment, self as God did to Jesus. Martin Scorsese highlights the purity of Jesus' soul reached after a painful struggle between his body and his soul, while all of us, including Scorsese, would forever live a life paved by temptations we'd always wish to be the last.",The Last Temptation of Christ
18,paul2001sw-1,Insufficiently tempting,5,21 March 2005,"As religions evolve, they face the central problem of how to present their God:an abstract, omnipotent but essentially unknowable being practically invites agnosticism (in the true sense of that word); but the personality-based gods of the ancient Greeks, in contrast, appear little more than a motley band of degenerate superheroes. Christianity, of course, solved this dilemma brilliantly in interpreting the figure of Jesus as both man and God. And you don't have to accept this interpretation as truth to appreciate that out of it, a narrative was fashioned (that of the Gospels) that works simply as a terrific story, both personal and political. Martin Scorcese's 'The Last Temptation of Christ', a film of the book of the same name, adds another layer of fiction in its re-interpretation of this tale. Scorcese's film attracted a lot of criticism for showing Jesus having sexual fantasies - more of which later - but it's real problems lie elsewhere. The movie is an uneasy mixture of stagey dialogue on one hand, and cinematic hyper-realism (Jesus literally ripping out his heart, for example), on the other. And crucially, Willem Defoe is a peculiar Jesus. It's hard to imagine anyone following this man: Scorcese chooses to have his cast speak in contemporary American English, and moreover the American language of his own north-east (it might have worked if he'd chosen that of the deep south instead): Defoe's Jesus (and sidekick Judas, played by Harvey Keitel) sound like the gangsters fresh from the 'Mean Streets' of New York, and demonstrate little in the way of preaching skill; additionally, Jesus seems to have little idea of what he actually stands for. The film's own ideas on the right way to imaginatively read the gospels also seem peculiar. So we see Jesus (a carpenter's son) working, before he takes up his ministry, not just as a carpenter but as a cross-maker for the Romans (a rather heavy piece of symbolism); while the portrait of Holy Week focuses entirely on the mystical (via an essentially novel plot), ignoring the treasure trove of profoundly human themes already present in the original story.As already mentioned, a big fuss was made by the religious right over the ending of the film, in which Jesus is shown briefly fantasising a sexual encounter with Mary Magdaleene: their objections say more about their own obsessive association of sexual continence and moral virtue than anything particular to this film. But it is possible to see the fantasises as contrived and bizarre when judged purely as a plot device. I don't believe in God, but I do believe that the gospels are a piece of moral storytelling the equal of anything written by Dostoyevsky. Jesus could have walked away from his fate as a martyr at any time prior to his arrest: that the film shows him considering this alternative only once it has become impossible is typical of its consistent preference for unanchored mysticism over character-driven drama. Overall, 'The Last Temptation of Christ' deserves credit for its ambition; but read Bulgakov's 'The Master and Margarita' instead to see what can really be achieved when basing fiction on the Bible.",The Last Temptation of Christ
19,g-bodyl,Still One of the Most Talked About Films Today!,8,20 June 2013,"If there is one film that can easily divide critics and regular people, it's this one, The Last Temptation of Christ. Directed by Martin Scorcese, this film is still one of the most widely talked about films today. I for one, happened to like this movie despite some unexpected scenes and being a Christian. It's well-written, well-acted, but it takes a long time to get where it wants to go. It's also may more talkative than I may have wished for.Marty's film is not directly based off the gospels themselves, but more about the inner struggles Jesus had between himself and Satan. This film does a good job of making Jesus not perfect like we all think of him as. For example, this film has him going against his father which we don't think of him as.This film is well-acted. Willem Dafoe may have been an odd choice to play Jesus but he did alright in my book. How Harvey Keitel was nominated for a Razzie is beyond me because he made a convincing Judas.Overall, this film is a good film about the less-than-perfect Jesus. It has some powerful scenes especially those involving Satan. I feel like this could use a little less talk and some more action to evenly pace it out. Peter Gabriel's score is unexpectedly awesome and fits into the movie. Even to this day, this ranks with The Passion of the Christ as the most controversial movies out there. It has it flaws, but it works on a high degree. I rate this film 8/10.",The Last Temptation of Christ
20,secondtake,"One of the best 2 or 3 movies about Jesus, with or without the famous blasphemous dream section",9,6 June 2015,"The Last Temptation of Christ (1988)A Jesus epic? Yes. And filled with New Hollywood grit and cultural daring. This is certainly an amazing movie, but read on. It also has the disease of many epics—it's overly long. What saves it over and over is the seeming realism (who can really know) and the quirky everyman acting (without pompousness or holy strains of Heaven behind the words).The leading man—THE leading man, some would say—is played rather brilliantly by Willem Dafoe. He might seem unlikely as the uber-hero, more of a method acting psychologically driven individualist, but when you think about it, that's exactly what Jesus of Nazareth needs on screen. There is no way—zero zilch—of being accurate or approaching the truth here. We don't even know historically if the man existed. But the accounts are detailed and filled with drama and wisdom and literary richness.And the book this movie is based on—a work of fiction, shouted proudly at the start of the movie—is about metaphor and imagination. This is not the missing information, or what a fifth gospel might say. Nothing real here, except that larger reality of what might help us understand what a person like Jesus might have been like, and might have felt, and might have dreamt on the cross.I saw this first when it was released in 1988 in Upstate New York at an art theater, and there was a long line to get in. Along this line was a another line of protesters with signs, proclaiming that the movie should not be seen—and implying that it should not have been made. Well, we saw it anyway of course, and it struck me then and strikes me now that the point of the film, and the book, is rather pious in the end. This is a pro-Jesus movie. You just can't take it literally.So the spoiler stuff is here. After two hours of really bold, vivid, raw, dusty (it's in the desert) accounting of the early years of Jesus the preacher and Son of God, we get to the crucifixion. And on the cross, as he is dying (just after he asks why God has forsaken him), he passes out. And in his dream, in his head, we have a guardian angel take him off the cross and show him what life would have been like if he had avoided his calling to be the Messiah and instead married and had a regular life. This includes having children and the whole normal stuff, which of course strikes some as blasphemy. But hang in there. The realization at the end of this dream is that he is going to grow old and die an ordinary man, and Jerusalem will fall without the hope of a new day, a new awakening. That is, his big chance to change the world is given up and the world is much worse off as a result. He is confronted by angry or disappointed old disciples, and he pulls himself out of his death bed and crawls back to Golgatha and awakes on the cross, accepting that he is doing a brave and amazing thing for the world. It doesn't matter that this isn't true. Or—from my humble point of view—this is exactly why it matters. It's a great idea, something to consider, a way of understanding yet again what the sacrifice on the cross was all about. And the teachings of Love and putting away the sword. That's not half bad for a book or a movie. Kudos to all, even almost 40 years later.",The Last Temptation of Christ
21,Bored_Dragon,It is accomplished!,10,26 May 2019,"""The dual substance of Christ - the yearning, so human, so superhuman, of man to attain God... has always been a deep inscrutable mystery to me. My principle anguish and source for all my joys and sorrows from my youth onward has been the incessant, merciless battle between the spirit and the flesh... and my soul is the arena where these two armies have clashed and met."" - Nikos Kazantzakis, from the book ""The Last Temptation of Christ""This controversial drama by Martin Scorsese is based on the novel of the same name by Nikos Kazantzakis, and brings us a portrait of Jesus Christ with all the virtues and flaws, fears and temptations of a realistic human being. Personally, I believe that Jesus was not a historical figure, but that he was the creation of the Church authorities, who composed his teachings from the teachings of several preachers from several periods, because they needed the Messiah to pass off their teachings and doctrine. But even if he has walked the land, the way he is portrayed in this movie seems to me more plausible than any other display of the Savior that I encountered so far. The film has an unusual and controversial approach to the presentation of Jesus' life (so much that in France Catholic fundamentalists burned several cinemas during its screenings, which resulted even in one fatal outcome) but if you watch it with an open heart and mind, without prejudice, I believe that you will realize that such an approach is not a blasphemy, but to a conscious, intelligent viewer can be much more susceptive and effective in conveying Jesus' teaching than the classic approach. The author of the book wrote in the prologue: ""This book is not a biography; it is the confession of every man who struggles. In publishing it I have fulfilled my duty, the duty of a person who has struggled much, was much embittered in his life, and had many hopes. I am certain that every free man who reads this book, so filled as it is with love, will more than ever before, better than ever before, love Christ.""""Harmony between Earth and the heart, that is the world of God.""I do not think there's a need to spend words on Scorsese's directing. With a budget of seven million dollars, which is a fairly low budget for this kind of film, Scorsese has done a miracle and earned an Oscar nomination. At first, Willem Dafoe did not appeal to me as Jesus, but bit less than three hours later I can no longer imagine anyone else in that role, and Harvey Keitel perfectly presented the counterweight role of Judas. Although already forty years old, Barbara Hershey is captivating in the role of Mary Magdalene, and I have no objections to performances of the rest of the cast either. The music of Peter Gabriel significantly contributes to the atmosphere, and the end of the film is one of the most memorable in my cinephile ""career."" I warmly recommend it to both believers and nonbelievers, because of the messages that the film conveys and which will, at least subconsciously, affect your view of the world, and as an unforgettable movie experience.""Thank you, Lord, for bringing me where I didn't want to go."" - Jesus10/10",The Last Temptation of Christ
22,The-Sarkologist,A message of hope not in truth but in faith,9,24 September 2013,"I suspect that this book is a very hard book to turn into a film, in particular with the hallucination that Jesus has at the end of the film where he comes down from the cross and lives his life as a good man. The problem with this is that it is difficult to portray this section of the film as an hallucination, and thus when we get to the final scene where he repents, it feels as if time is suddenly rewound and that he gets to change the decision that he originally made (or appeared to make) and that is to come down off of the cross.We are all probably aware that when this film was released there was a huge amount of controversy over the film, namely coming from a segment of society that really did not understand what Kazantzakis was exploring, and they simply took the film at face value. This to me is not surprising since the segment of society that were outraged at this film tends to also read the entire bible literally and sit down and try to map out future events based upon the books of Revelation and Daniel. There particular people simply do not understand allegory, and would not see allegory even if it smacked them in the face.However, this film is not a Christian film, it is a gnostic film. The reason I say that is because it deals with the struggle between the spirit and the flesh, and this is outlined right at the beginning of the film. The story uses the life of Christ to explore this struggle. The idea is that that which is of the spirit is good and that which is of the flesh is evil, and as such anything pertaining to the flesh, and in turn, to the physical world, exists to drag us away from the purity of the spirit. Thus, to reach enlightenment, one must reject the physical and embrace the spiritual.The bible does not necessarily see things that way at the bible sees the spiritual and the physical world as being intertwined and evil exists both in the spiritual and physical world, in the same way the goodness also exists in both realms. The biblical view of marriage and of sex is that it is a good thing that should be embraced, but not to the point that it overwhelms our lives and distracts us from the spiritual. In the same way the one should not wonder around rejecting the physical and focusing on the spiritual because in the end one loses connection with humanity and the world, and thus is no good for anybody.While the main focus of the film is the temptation that Christ experiences on the cross, which is the last temptation (and the bible does have him tempted in that way when the crowds cry out to him to come down from the cross and prove that he is the Son of God), the lead up to this scene has him experiencing numerous temptations as well. For instance there is the temptation to become a political leader as opposed to a spiritual leader, and this temptation takes the form of Judas throughout the film.What we also have in this film is that Jesus does not know or understand his destiny at the beginning. In a way Jesus journeys from being a simply man who does a despicable job, to becoming the Son of God. He actually does not realise that his destiny is the cross until he actually comes closer to the cross. Granted, he begins making crosses for the Romans, but that is a reflection of his destiny that he does not understand. Further, he begins by asking forgiveness for his sins namely because he does not understand his nature and who he is. We see this journey as he tries various means, to come to an understanding of what his destiny is, and even angers Judas by repeatedly changing his mind.I guess this film is very much reflective of our own journeys through life, whether we be Christian or not. It is interesting that when Jesus meets with Paul near the end and rebukes him for his lies, Paul simply responds that the truth is irrelevant and it really comes down to what people want to believe, The reality of the death and resurrection is actually irrelevant because what people want is hope and what the resurrection offers is hope. Those who go around attacking and destroying Christianity really have no hope and are only doing that to take hope away from people. In the end we spend our time (or even waste our time) arguing for the reality of the resurrection, when in the end it is irrelevant – if somebody wants to believe then they will believe whether it is true or not.It reminds me of some of my experiences in church. My faith not only gives me hope, it also gives me freedom. In the end that freedom does not come through the reality of the resurrection, but it comes through the fact that I have faith and that I trust God at his word. However, there are many inside the church and out that want to take that hope and that freedom away from you, and they will try to undermine you at every corner to try and do that. The thing is that we simply cannot let them do that because the reason they are doing that is because they are jealous that they do not have the hope or the freedom that you have.",The Last Temptation of Christ
23,clanciai,Martin Scorsese getting it all wrong with Nikos Kazantzakis resulting in blooming speculation,9,2 April 2021,"According to this version, Jesus manufactured crosses for the Romans to crucify Jews with. After the resurrection of Lazarus, he was murdered for being a living witness of Jesus' greatest miracle. After the triumphant entry into Jerusalem, Jesus went directly to create havoc in the Temple, triggering an insurrection causing many innocents to die by the hands of soldiers and guards. And so on. All this is mere conjecture and way out from the original testimonies.However, Willem Dafoe makes a very credible and convincing Christ, and he might have made the best Christ on screen ever. Harvey Keitel, on the other hand, is utterly unconvincing, an aggressive nuisance, whom it is unbelievable that Jesus could bear with at all. The best and most convincing of the apostles is Peter.Another character all wrong is Pontius Pilate, who appears here as a reasonable intellectual who tries to speak some sense with Jesus, trying to behave politely like a gentleman, which he certainly was not. He was appointed by Sejanus, who ruled as a military dictator of Rome as Tiberius retired, and Pontius Pilate was his instrument of brutality in Palestine and nothing less.The greatest credit goes to the beauty of the film. It is cinematographically and artistically thoroughly enjoyable all the way. The scenery is consistently exquisite. Then there is the very remarkable conclusion, bringing up 'the last temptation' which happens as he nailed on the cross has an alternative vision and experience of his life, which includes his meeting with St. Paul, whom he denounces as a liar and impostor. All these speculations are matters indeed for further afterthought and speculation.In brief, it is above all a great visual experience for all its lack of seriousness, and it is not tempting to see it again.",The Last Temptation of Christ

This is a man who makes the choice of self-sacrifice for the good of his fellow men, despite the temptations of an alternative life - shown in this film by a life with Mary Magdelene rather than dying at the Crucifixion.Played by Willem Dafoe with great sensitivity, this Christ performs miracles and discusses the intricacies of life and death with his disciples. Harvey Keitel is Judas, a rough man who fails to understand the significance of being the chosen Son of God; while Barbara Hershey is an effective Magdelene.

28,jzappa,The Armies of the Soul,8,6 December 2008,"Christianity teaches that Jesus was human, yet the son of God. Being simultaneously both is one of the religion's many vaguenesses, and the matter of this unrelentingly personal vision, neither based on the Gospels nor against them. Though not born with the mark of sin, to be human, Jesus would've had to be victim to temptation, having free will. As the son of God, he'd naturally have instigated the most serious deceit of Satan. And if you think Christ's efforts are invalidated by the titular sequence, wouldn't it take a man that long to understand what God understands? I'm not religious, but here's a film that fully engages me on the figure of Christ. His mission is as abstract to him as to us, only learning bit by bit how he must transform and eventually sacrifice himself. He's acting on the emotions and psychology of a person, baffled, disturbed. He confesses early on that he's not the son of Mary and Joseph but of God, so he thinks this is Satan talking, and believes he's the most terrible sinner. Somehow, this Jesus makes sense, a Jesus with a grave dilemma. It seems more reverent to his divinity to show how tempting human life is. How tempting free will is, rather than the responsibility of being Messiah.The film opens with enough audacity for a whole movie in the eyes of most religious zealots. It presents Judas as morally superior to Jesus, who is collaborating with Roman oppressors. Judas then surveys the entire inhuman process in which Jesus plays a direct part. I think Jesus' hand in this tortuous act is meant to be some displaced attempt to fulfill his ultimate act of carrying his own cross. Many of our wrongdoings as people tend to be mistaken efforts to fulfill what we believe we're supposed to do, aren't they? Or to escape responsibility.What are the odds of a human being obediently assuming the responsibility to die horribly? Didn't Jesus-the-guy theoretically have a right not to becomes Jesus-the-god if he didn't want to pay such a horrific price and define his whole life by it? He's passionately chastised by Judas, as well as Mary, between johns. This gives so much more genuine-feeling poignancy to his later defiance for anyone to continue stoning her if anyone can say they've never sinned than whenever they told me in school. He says it with authentic humility, knowing those ugly insides of being human all too well to be commanding them in belief that he's the son of the universe. It's even more poignant, and powerfully timeless, when this first attempt at a message of love is taken by the angry hoard as a message of death.Another sensitive consideration is the earnest expression by Christ's peers of qualms, even jealousy in his being ostensibly Chosen. Even beyond Judas and Mary's righteous indignation, one fellow tells Jesus that every day he yearns to hear God's voice, has dedicated his life to God's affirmation of his soul, and we can see that it hurts and confuses him that Jesus, who's collaborated with the Romans, who frequents the presence of a prostitute, is the one God chose. This is a spiritual conflict that shoots straight into the heart of the burning questions all people have about God: How many people have questioned their faith and often lost it owing to an overpowering sense that their best efforts at being good are going unreciprocated, unnoticed, or disdained by an onslaught of tragic experiences, while people of little moral compass, wisdom or human contribution reap unprecedented benefits, without reciprocating the good fortune as you would. What a bold, refreshing approach to put pressure on Christ as a protagonist, to show him as one of us, striving to be good despite the high personal cost of his ultimate accomplishment. Even bolder to hear him say that he'd give in to any and all temptations, vices, crimes and rebellions, that the only reason he doesn't is because he's afraid. Do religious people worship and abide by the dogmas because of altruistic impulses, or because they're afraid?Sometimes thinking too much about the use of modern everyday American dialect in 30 AD, it seems to lose credibility. But Schrader is neither too erudite nor crude. He and Scorsese subtly tread the fine line of having what's said be entirely of the period and tradition while giving them the most straightforward way to say it. Verna Bloom, strongly moving in her few scenes, gives us a Mother Mary who, emotionally, sacrificed in equal measure with her son. Still, there are times when the ""we commend thee to our God"" content of the dialogue being given a Flatbush or Lower East Side texture seems more along Julie Taymor lines than Visconti, Welles or Rossellini. What's even more powerful is Jesus' low-pitched inner-voice narration, powerfully reminiscent of the quiet, intimate commentary of Terrence Malick's main characters.There's more than one way to consider the Christ story. Otherwise, why would there be more than one Gospel? As well as one of Scorsese's labors of love, this is also as abstract as Kundun, perhaps more disjointed as well: The images of Satan as fire and snake, the ambiguous reality of the eponymous temptation, import twice the abstruseness of Taxi Driver's final scene or Cape Fear's red skies. Such is religious lore. Many gaps, many questions, but nonetheless infinite passion. Religious viewers will understand. For those of us without religious beliefs, this film is prone to arouse more significant contemplation on the character of Jesus than any other ever made.",The Last Temptation of Christ
29,thinker1691,""" If the Power to heal the sick were yours, would you hesitate to use it? """,9,29 January 2009,"Among the hundreds of films which people have had an opportunity to view, this is one which is most frowned upon. Immediate controversy is given that it is a blatant disrespectful alternative story of the Christ and therefore condemned before people have a chance to judge it for themselves. Having been privilege to see it, I can state unequivocally, it is one of the most courageous offerings on this subject ever. Taken from the biblical story of Jesus Christ during the last years of his life, it is a beautifully crafted optional version to what has traditionally been accepted as fact. In this story, the Christ (Willem Dafoe) is betrayed by Judas (Harvey Keitel) arrested, condemned and thereafter Crucified. As an alternative, in this version, he does not die. Instead he survives and later enters into a marriage with Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey). The story thereafter is 'what if' and there-in lies the new ending to the otherwise traditional tale. The film is brutally realistic, suggestive and for many, artistically stylish. Dafoe is incredible and gives a stirring reverential rendition which may help many in their quest for spiritual understanding. Great Film. ****",The Last Temptation of Christ
30,strong-122-478885,"The Controversy, The Crap, And The Compromise For Box-Office Success",3,24 September 2011,"Sp-Sp-Spoiler Alert! - Alert! - Alert! As controversial as this film may have apparently been considered upon its heated release back in 1988, I think of it now as being pretty tame, lame, and, in the long run, tres' disappointing and uninspiring, indeed.I mean, let's face it, since Christ's ""last"" temptation wasn't violating, or breaking, even one of the ""holy"" 10 Commandments, then, I ask you, what the heck was all the bloody fuss and public outcry about, anyways? Eh? What? OK. I do admit that, yes, it was pretty low and degenerate of Christ to have actually placed himself in a line of horny men all waiting, like regular, little pigs, for their turn to screw that whore, Mary Magdalene. Yep. That was ultimately a totally stupid thing for Christ to do, considering, if nothing else, that STDs were probably running rampant in those good, old ""holy"" days.But, besides that, wouldn't you honestly think that when it came to the ""temptation"" of sex for Christ that he would've at least had the bloody sense to round up some ""nice"", little, Jewish virgin from the neighborhood? Surely he could've found one of such chaste purity as that (they did exist in those days) who was more than willing to have Christ break her cherry for her.Personally, I would've enjoyed this movie immensely had Christ actually been tempted into becoming a regular ""holy-terror""-type. Yeah. Christ as a real ""bad"" boy.In other words, I was hoping like hell that Christ (out of temptation) would, in fact, start breaking some of the 10 Commandments. Like, perhaps, Christ could've started out by dishonoring his parents. Now, that's always very effective. And, then, maybe, getting a little more daring, Christ could've defiantly not remembered the Sabbath. And, then, as the ultimate climax of temptation, bad-boy Christ could've killed off a few of the 12 Disciples (the real stragglers, of course), for good measure. I mean, there were far too many snobbish, little bores in that elite group, anyways.(Uh... Sorry for making with the jokes here - But, hey! - C'mon, now - This film really did take itself far too seriously for my liking.) All in all - When you really think about the scenario that I've just described above, this is the sort of thing that would've quite rightfully earned this film the kind of controversy that it otherwise (erroneously) garnered for itself over nothing.In a nutshell - This film, concerning Christ dealing with his own self-doubts and eventually accepting himself as ""The Chosen One"", moved along at a literal snail's pace, contained some of the most hypocritically preposterous dialog imaginable, and, if that wasn't disappointing enough, the special effects were so chintzy, as to be downright laughable at times. It was the talking ""burning bush"", in particular, that totally killed me.A Final Warning To All - Do not be in any way ""tempted"" by The Last Temptation Of Christ. Its story is misleading, misguided, and mundane. This film is a far cry from being really good entertainment.And, yes, Willem DaFoe's portrayal of Jesus Christ was, amongst other things, insincere and uninspiring.",The Last Temptation of Christ
31,PWNYCNY,Probably the best movie of the Jesus Christ genre,9,12 November 2011,"This is probably the best movie of the Jesus Christ genre, the reason being that it uses contemporary language to tell the story. According to the Bible, Jesus Christ was both human and divine. This raises a question that the movie poses: How did Jesus the man deal with the divinity within him? As a man, Jesus is racked with fears and doubts. This movie shows how Jesus dealt with those emotions to fulfill his mission. As a human he is vulnerable to temptations, and the success of his mission, and whether mankind will receive salvation, depends on whether he succumbs to those temptations. It is easy to say that we know what happened with Jesus, but that is not the point of the movie. Rather, the point of the movie is that although divine, Jesus as a human had to struggle to fulfill his mission, the success of which was not guaranteed. This uncertainty is what grabs the audiences' attention and makes this a great movie.",The Last Temptation of Christ
32,dee.reid,"Martin Scorsese's ""Last Temptation"" is a +Passion+ fulfilled",10,29 May 2005,"""Let he who is without sin, cast the first stone"" - John 8:7That immortal biblical statement should ring true for any real believer in the Word of God, and the critics who view films about the life of Jesus Christ. In the hostile times we live in today, we know that words like ""faith,"" ""God,"" and ""divine-right"" are intermingled with our vocabulary and for anyone that still believes in separation of church and state, this is a nightmare come true as we know these are words that should not be coming from the mouths of American politicians.Keeping that in mind, I was only three years-old when director Martin Scorsese brought forth his passionate film, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (1988), to the big screen amidst a volatile firestorm of protests from (mostly) right-wing fanatics who had the gall to trash it and (surprise, surprise) had not even seen it themselves.To best view ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" one should look at it with eyes untainted by the political rhetoric and dogmatic procedures of the fundamental Right and Left. It's a masterful work of art and should be judged as such, not on its allegiance to the source material. Of course, what many people have failed to realize about this film, is that ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is a work of fiction, adapted from the novel written in 1955 by author Nikos Kazantzakis.As a Christian myself, a Baptist and regular church-goer, I don't feel that this film is blasphemous nor is it detrimental in any way to Christ's image or character. In fact, I think that if viewed closely and without intrusion from rabid militants, you'll find perhaps the most accurate portrait of our Savior ever witnessed in any format outside The Bible itself.But to first understand it, you must realize it is FICTION, not an interpretation of the Gospels according to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. I personally find it inconceivable that any one person, including Christ, regardless of any divine-right, would willingly go to their deaths and enter the realm of martyrdom without experiencing some degree of hesitation at first (or later), and that was Kazantzakis' whole point with the novel: to help us actually relate to Jesus by showing that He too had feelings such as doubt and fear, and that He was at heart... a man. (This is the real offense by NOT showing this side of His personality.)In the film, Jesus of Nazareth (Willem Dafoe), is already an adult, builds crosses for the imperialist Romans and is otherwise living a normal human existence. His friend, Judas (Harvey Keitel), thinks that Jesus isn't the savior and should enter politics, as he believes he could lead the Jews in a revolt against the Roman army.Jesus, meanwhile, is crippled by the many hallucinations and voices that cry out His name. In this film, Christ is shown as a man who is at war with His father, God, and at first rejects His mission (which has yet to be fully revealed to Him) and is on shaky grounds with His faith, despite having never sinned. The film strips away the more mythical qualities of Christ's story and swaps them for a more realistic depiction of Him embracing His divinity.He still faces the many demons and temptations that Satan sends in His direction, fights the negative influences of Judas, saves the whore Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey) from being stoned to death, chooses his 12 apostles, teaches God's ministry, receives the scorn of the more skeptical members of His flock, and is of course, beaten and tortured by the Romans - eventually experiencing death through the crucifixion - which we all know is the most gruesome and grueling act of murder ever conceived.Dafoe was carrying the weight of a hefty role on his shoulders and was robbed by the Academy in '88 of a rightful Oscar nomination, and Keitel's thick Brooklyn accent does tend to get in the way sometimes. (On a side note, this is a feat that would be eliminated by Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" last year.)It's a real shame that unprovoked controversy allowed this film to fall short of its goal of evoking thoughtful discussion about faith and humanity. I haven't seen a film that's this effective in providing an earnest portrait of a man coming to grips with his life destiny. The controversy mostly centered on a scene during Christ's crucifixion, which I'll detail next.David Ehrenstein, in the an essay included in the Criterion Collection DVD for this film, notes that, ""...'The Last Temptation of Christ' is a stirring affirmation of faith both in the person of Jesus and in His teachings."" But before that, Ehrenstein stated, ""Rather than {it being} a 'blasphemous' attack on Christ's divinity, climaxing with a salacious 'sex scene...'"" {WHAT?!?!} Yes, folks, Jesus has sex - with Mary Magdalene - the prostitute!That's the ""last temptation."" It's when Jesus is tempted by a little girl (Satan) and is shown life as an ordinary man, not the Messiah. It's this scene alone that's received the butt of the controversy and many bloodthirsty attacks by the fanatical Right... and a few Left.What they missed, however, is that this scene occurs in a flash, a dream, while Christ is suffering on the cross. But even He is able to reject the Devil's temptations and reinvest Himself in His divine destiny. But even here, in this vivid yet pleasant hallucination, Christ realizes that peace of mind is costly, as he is shown the price of His rejection of His divinity, and this is why He reawakens on the cross and states His last words, ""It is accomplished.""""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is not about the Crucifixion (like Gibson's ""Passion""), but is about His humanity, and how we, as humans, can find it just as He did.10/10",The Last Temptation of Christ
33,mjneu59,obviously a pet project for Scorsese,7,30 November 2010,"Martin Scorsese's controversial portrait of the reluctant Messiah wants to be a paraphrase of Holy Scripture presented as fiction, but the conflict between spirit and flesh at the heart of the novel by Nikos Kazanzakis is translated on screen into the old, familiar battle between art and commerce. The result is a study in contrasts, with scenes of extraordinary visual power (Christ performing his miracles, and meeting mad prophet John the Baptist) rubbing shoulders against strictly earthbound Sunday School lessons (Satan, as a serpent, exploding like a grenade when denied).Scorsese's laudable attempt to convey the novelty of Jesus' teachings (on a budget which didn't allow for the usual biblical cast of thousands) helps give his film an immediacy lacking in other Hollywood Passion Plays, breathing fresh air into a historically solemn and stilted genre. But the screenplay by Paul Schrader suffers whenever it tries to answer deep spiritual questions, for example during the now notorious (and really quite chaste) dream sequence, when a visceral crucifixion scene is halted in its tracks so Christ can finally be tempted by a twenty-minute trailer of mortal life.Elsewhere it's clear the real savior of the film is ace cinematographer Michael Ballhaus, whose typically fluid camera-work accelerates a movie that might have seemed even longer than it already is because the story is so familiar.",The Last Temptation of Christ
34,barnabyrudge,Offensive - no. Fantastic film-making - yes!,9,14 April 2005,"Has there ever been a more misunderstood film than Martin Scorcese's The Last Temptation Of Christ? Released amid great controversy and accused of being an offensive and unholy film, the truth of the matter is that it is a deeply reverent work which has the courage to ask challenging questions about the pressures and doubts Jesus must have experienced as the appointed Messiah. It also shows the violence of the times in graphic detail. If viewers consider it blasphemous to explore on film the immense burden of duty that Jesus bore through his life, then they are narrow-minded and ignorant. If people feel that to show the brutality and harshness of life in Roman times is tasteless and inappropriate, then they are guilty of glorifying difficult but factual truths. There is NOTHING offensive about this film. There is, however, much that is challenging.Jesus (Willem Dafoe), an honest carpenter, saves Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey) from a stoning. Already dimly aware that he is destined to lead an extraordinary life, he soon finds himself being drawn into the role of a religious figurehead. But Jesus finds it hard to accept that he is a Messiah, and as his reputation and following grows he constantly questions if he is a strong enough man to handle the burden of being God's son. After isolating himself in the desert, where he experiences several hallucinations in which he is confronted by visual manifestations of good and evil, Jesus finally concludes that he IS the true son of God and whole-heartedly sets about imparting his love and wisdom to all who'll listen. Later betrayed to the disgruntled Romans by his friend Judas Iscariot (Harvey Keitel), Jesus is crucified. While on the cross, he imagines what his life would have turned out like if he had shied away from his duty as the Messiah and lived life like a mere mortal.It is this final section of the film that has provoked the most vociferous outrage. The sequence shows Jesus as he slowly dies on the cross, dreaming of an alternative life in which he sins and copulates and hates like all normal people. Many people have criticised the film on the grounds that these scenes are blasphemous. Such claims are nonsense - the film is not saying that Jesus was a sinner, nor that he gave in to temptation of the flesh, nor still that he was a man filled with hate. The film is merely saying that, in such great pain and so close to death while still just a young man, he might - just maybe - have wondered if it was all worth it. At the end of the film, we see Jesus accept his role knowing that his death is the ultimate act of unselfish love, so the film actually is totally in agreement with what all Christians believe. If the film had come to the conclusion that Jesus's whole life was a waste, his death too, then maybe the detractors would've had cause to complain. But how can they possibly be offended by the film as it stands? For goodness sake, it's a film about absolute faith!!! In truth, The Last Temptation Of Christ is an excellent movie. Compellingly acted, beautifully shot on Moroccan locations, and full of telling ideas, it is a work of real depth and power. The accents are sometimes distracting and some of the dialogue occasionally betrays ill-suited modernisms, but apart from these minor drawbacks it is one of the most important and thought-provoking films ever made.",The Last Temptation of Christ
35,Cristi_Ciopron,"Obviously bland, the philistines' delight; irrelevant either as blasphemy or religion",3,24 August 2008,"Scorsese is a typical unequal gifted directorstriking movies besides loads of crap of the worst kind . That he directed rubbish like Cape Fear (1991), The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), The Color of Money (1986)inexcusable crapis an objective fact. He is limited, even narrow, he does not have a world-view (or at least one worth mentioning), and his appeal is one of an exploitation director (exactly like with De Palma and with the truer, early Coppola). It is highly relevant that Tarantino selects so many of Scorsese's flicks in his favorite films lists. Scorsese is in no way a great director, even less an author (apart from the minimal understanding, that calls author any person that expresses certain aspirations and intentions). His worst films are typically abstract and lifeless. I never understood the accusations of blasphemy directed at this adaptation; they come from a misconception. The controversy rests upon a misunderstanding. It is true that borrowing some Christian elements treated like obsolete mythology is debatable, objectionable, inappropriate, even lousybut that's all. Scorsese's twisted epic is a slapdash of narcissist delusions about the fate of the man of genius, about the condition of the extraordinary manthe Biblical setting is only a pretext. This subject is approached by the hack Scorsese with all the clumsiness required. Liking much this dirty piece of selfindulging defines exactly the level of a viewer (like FORREST GUMP and other such phony masterpieces for the philistines). Bunuel, to give THE example, had a taste and a talent for blasphemy, for sacrilege. His thoughts are as void and hollow, yet his film hurts, upsets. But Scorsese' s fantasy is, on the contrary, quite inoffensive and bland. It is too dumb, too kitschy, too schmaltzy and Ebertian to be offensive. Both Scorsese and his writer (and, for this matter, their Greek literary source) are the delight and pride of the philistinesdwarfs masquerading as giant blasphemers. I knew Scorsese was narrow, uncultured and intellectually negligibleI did not need this prove. Scorsese wants to speak about the man of geniusas understood by the pal who was to make CAPE FEAR. Egotistical, narcissist delusions and fantasies on a Christian pretext. What if Christ were not the Christ? The flick is not interested into demythologizing or being religiously controversial, but aims at installing a provincially valid understanding of the misfortunes of the genius. Since nothing else is added ,this is too little to make a film. It is immediately visible, it is too obvious that this GreekItaloamerican Gospel is not about the Christwhence this idea?but a thirdrate reflection upon the condition of the genius, the superior manthat is, what the Scorsese/Schrader tandem understood of it (terribly little, I must say ). The movie is not at all about Christ or Christianity, it does not speak about them; if it is a blasphemy, it is only in an indirect wayby its nonchalance in borrowing some elements from what it obviously treats as mythology. Bunuel's blasphemies, or Fellini's, were indeed about Christ or the Church; Scorsese's films is not. The indignation of those who vocally accuse it are misplaced. The flick can be accused of borrowing these elements; but its intention is not to speak about the Christbut about the genius, the artist, etc..Yes, it is kitsch, eerie and uncanny. But it's the eeriness of a barren ,deserted, empty heart. The blasphemy, even if intended (which it is not) is uninteresting and insipid. If you wish blasphemy, desecration, etc., this is not what you are looking for. The conception is way too narrow and small. These are the Scorsese's ego' s fantasies and kitsch, and not a largescale blasphemy. The blasphemyseeker will not be satisfied with this schmaltz. It is a mistake, a fortuitous fitting of names.The film is embarrassingly smallminded and provincial. It draws strongly from the Greek's megalomania; it shows once again how far is the Hollywoodian cannon from any relation with the genuine spirituality. If it's a blasphemy, it's a dull, banal and almost innocent one. It is an insipid, tern, banal sketch of the megalomaniac illusions about being a genius and a prophet (in the secularized sense ).Kitsch piece of slapdash about genius, the artist's destiny, etc.This slapdash is not about the Christnor was it intended to bebut about the delusions and projections of vainglory and phony geniality of a deadly trio (Scorsese, the ludicrous prophet of a phony Gospel; his writer; and their literary source). This is modernist phoniness at its highest. An _unably disguised, kitschy sermon about the genius' condition as conceived by Scorsese (the last man on earth to know something about that!). Thoroughly inept, the flick is intriguingly deprived of any relevance. It is bizarrely empty. The lack of subtlety passes into ugly kitsch. This is humanism of the worst and phoniest kind. It's all big words and pretensions of originalitysadly unfounded.",The Last Temptation of Christ

When Jesus is getting more messages from God, people who listen to him starts questioning him especially his loyal followers.

This original feature doesn't follow the story from the bible. This movie is based on a highly controversial novel by Nikos Kazantzakis. What makes ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" so unique that it shows Jesus as a three dimensional character comparing to these boring biblical movies that Jesus was portrayal as a one dimensional man usually. This is one of Dafoe's best roles. It is his most moving role, comparing to the other movies which he is known to play villains or sleazy roles.The Canadian DVD has an sharp (If occasionally grainy) anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround Sound.

37,Steffi_P,"""Belongs to everybody""",10,7 April 2011,"This is a picture that notoriously got many in the Christian establishment riled up over its non-canonical depiction of the life of Christ. As can be seen by anyone who has actually watched The Last Temptation of Christ, this is a misunderstanding of its message. Director Martin Scorsese, for whom this was a cherished project, is a Catholic, as was the man upon whose novel the movie is based Nikos Kazantzikos, and the story aims to explore and clarify the nature of Christ and his sacrifice. Besides, maybe the pictures fundamentalist critics should be a little more positive about its impact upon audiences. I am an atheist; this is the only one of the many pictures of the Jesus myth that has moved me emotionally.Aside from its content, The Last Temptation of Christ is a profoundly beautiful piece of cinema. I normally find Scorsese's style as a director rather distracting and excessive, but here he is simply note perfect, orchestrating the picture with sensitive rhythm and delicate control. In the opening scenes we are introduced to a young Jesus troubled by the voice of God. The camera is prowling, moody, somewhat detached from the setting. Then Judas bursts in, venting his anger upon Jesus, and suddenly everything is very tight and focused, close to the action with lots of cuts. Finally, as Judas calms, the camera becomes still, the shots longer, and there is a wonderful moment as a flock of sheep passes by behind Harvey Keitel, a visual release of tension. Throughout the picture the tone is set through camera movement, slow-motion, the use of sound disappearing and reappearing, and the haunting Peter Gabriel score. This overtly stylised approach is not one that works well for drama, but it gives this picture a stirring, meditative quality that is very appropriate, and breathtaking to behold.The Last Temptation of Christ is a loving presentation of the Jesus story which shows him to be as much a human as a deity; flawed, tempted, terrified by his own fate. This is not only a Christ one can empathise with, it is a Christ whose sacrifice has an appropriate magnitude because we can see it is not something he goes into lightly. Actor Willem Dafoe expertly treads the line between the human man and god made flesh in a performance that is a world away from the stuffy, lifeless, stained-glass window depictions that have gone before it. The expressions of love, regret, loyalty and courage in this picture are enough to move me to tears. I come away from The Last Temptation of Christ, still happily an atheist, but also having been touched by what is a human story, and not only a divine one.",The Last Temptation of Christ
38,ShootingShark,Stunning And Passionate Variation On The Christ Story,7,26 June 2005,"In ancient times, Jesus Christ, a lowly man from Nazareth, tries to resist a calling from a voice he thinks is God, telling him to preach a doctrine of freedom and love for God and one another. Ultimately however he fulfils this destiny, but his cause prompts the Roman authorities to capture and crucify him, martyring him for all time for the sins of mankind.Because any story about religious faith is an intensely spiritual and cerebral concept, the Jesus story is hard to film (the best adaptation is the 1977 Franco Zeffirelli / Robert Powell TV miniseries Jesus Of Nazareth, and the best cinema version is the 1961 Nicholas Ray / Jeffrey Hunter film King Of Kings). This movie is not based on the gospels, but rather on a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, which retells many of the gospel parables (the sermon on the mount, the stoning of Mary Magdalene, the raising of Lazarus, the money-changers in the temple, the tale of John the Baptist, etc), but with a radically different emphasis on character. Christ is very much a man in this movie, full of fear, doubt and self-pity, struggling with the significance of his destiny, and both Judas and Magdalene feature much more prominently in his story. It ends with a dream sequence in which Satan disguises himself as a child and tempts Christ on the cross with an end to his suffering and a dream of a life as an ordinary man with a family; a temptation which Christ ultimately rejects. It is an extraordinarily powerful, original and thought-provoking examination of Christianity, which has at its heart the fundamental conflict between Christ the Man and Christ the God. It is also exquisitely made and passionately acted by a terrific cast. Dafoe gives a masterful performance in a role which is almost impossible to play, and Keitel, Hershey and Stanton all give tremendous support, while Bowie is an inspired scene-stealing piece of casting as the status-quo-seeking Pilate (""There are three-thousand skulls on Golgotha, probably more. I do wish you people would go and count them sometime.""). Brilliantly scripted by Paul Schrader, with superb location photography in Morocco by Michael Ballhaus, and a stunningly evocative score by Peter Gabriel featuring a bewildering variety of ethnic African and Asian sounds and musicians. Movies about religion are often turgid and bland at best. Upon this film's release however, both it and Scorsese were vilified as blasphemous by many so-called devout Christians, many of whom hadn't even seen it - ignorant half-wits, one and all. This is arguably a great director's best and most personal film, and it is a beautiful, passionate, intense, intelligent and above all, deeply spiritual work.",The Last Temptation of Christ
39,truemythmedia,Masterpiece of Spiritual Struggle,10,26 November 2019,"I don't know why I waited so long to see this film. I guess the attitude from growing up amongst fundamentalist Christians still stuck in my brain. ""'The Last Temptation of Christ' is a blasphemous disgusting film,"" I can almost hear my teacher's, deacon's, and pastor's opinions as I would have overheard them.I am no fundamentalist anymore but there are certain films which I just never got around to or never really thought about once I threw off some of my old preconceptions about them. I loved Martin Scorsese's ""Silence"" and since we wanted to do a deep dive into some of his films, I figured now was the time to delve into the Jesus movie that I was warned about as a childWow! I really loved this movie. Of course I understand why many Christians look at it and see nothing but blasphemy but I can't help feeling that they are totally missing the point of this film. I've never really understood why people get all bent out of shape when a movie doesn't adhere to historical fact, a particular theory of events, or viewpoint other than the predominant one.This film never claims to be a gospel account. In fact it claims the opposite, that it is fictionalized. It's apparent right from the beginning that there is no intention on the part of the director to adhere to any sort of biblical narrative or interpretation. Instead, Scorsese is using a well known story, events, and persons to explore ideas which he finds interesting. Of all the criticisms I found of this film, this one has to be the weakest.So, now that that is out of the way, let's get into the good about this movie.First off, Dafoe (""The Lighthouse""). His performance as Jesus is absolutely phenomenal. The humanity he brings to the role is thick and layered on. His fears aren't just moments of questioning if God really wants him to do something and then, oh, he does, OK. His fears are complex and changing as his situation changes and the fears never fully go away. His frustration at God for giving him a calling which he can't explain to people fully or prove to them when they ask. The way he slyly does a miracle and just nods across the room at the one person who realizes it is all a side of Jesus that I had never seen portrayed before.One of the reasons that Scorsese is so good at expounding faith concepts is that he is genuinely interest in Christ's humanity. Many Christians tend to look at the hypostatic union (Christ is fully God and fully Human) and sort of shorthand it to Christ is human in that he has a body but in every other way he is God. It diminishes his humanity and in many ways makes him unrelatable to us. Scorsese goes the other way, delving so deep into Christ's humanity that the Deity of Jesus seems to be the background. Neither for these approaches is where I am personally at but seeing this film definitely had me considering what some of my basic assumptions about Christ and his experience as a human must have been like.Honestly, if not for the nudity, I would recommend this movie to almost any Christian. Seeing Christ acting so human makes it easy to put yourself in that place and wonder what we would do if it was our task to die for the world. I saw myself in his relationship with Mary Magdalene. I saw myself in his fear of death. I saw myself in his want to run away and live in seclusion.Perhaps that is the real achievement of the film. By allowing the audience to connect so completely with the character of Jesus it highlights the disconnect that there is between who I am as a human and what my expectations of holiness or God are. I see the struggle to defeat the passions of the body for the sake of the spirit, to lay down my life for others. The challenge to be everything that God has and wants for me is always a hard one. It confronts us everyday and many times gets put on the back burner while we go on with the rest of our lives. A film like this forces a confrontation between the warring sides of ourselves and gives us room to meditate upon the task from a perspective we may not have considered before.I found this film to be extremely meaningful and soul provoking but not in the sense that it pushed me to a protest line to lament the creation of such an abomination.No. This film had me on my knees in prayer the next morning for the first time in a week. This film had me talking to God during the day, again. This film pulled me out of my everyday formula and into the presence of God.",The Last Temptation of Christ
40,davidmvining,One of Scorsese's Greatest Achievements,10,21 November 2019,"When I originally made my Top Ten more than a decade ago, I slowly filled it a couple of different ways. One of them was to ask myself, ""X director should be on the list. Which of X's movies should appear?""I've always loved Scorsese. He's been a titan of cinema since the 70s and, unlike many of his brethren, has lost none of his skill. He's as talented and exciting today as he was when he brought Mean Streets and Taxi Driver to the screen. He's still so talented that, in much the same way I would be open to the idea of replacing Kubrick's 2001 with Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, I would also be open to the idea of replacing Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ with Scorsese's Silence.Still, I've revisited Scorsese's entry and I have to say that I'm as happy to have it on the list as ever.ControversyThe dual substance of Christ-the yearning, so human, so superhuman, of man to attain God... has always been a deep inscrutable mystery to me. My principle anguish and source of all my joys and sorrows from my youth onward has been the incessant, merciless battle between the spirit and the flesh...and my soul is the arena where these two armies have clashed and met.""
NIKOS KAZANTZAKISThis film is not based upon the Gospels but upon this fictional exploration of the eternal spiritual conflict.That is the first thing that the audience sees when The Last Temptation of Christ begins, and it tells you exactly how to interpret the movie.
This is a movie where the main character is Jesus, but it's not actually about Jesus. The movie is about the internal battle within every man's heart to be holy while living in a real and physical world.I was alive when the movie was in its original release, but I was a grand 2 years old. I wasn't exactly plugged into the cultural consciousness at the time, so all I have seen about the controversy of its original release comes from small news clips of angry protestors outside of theaters screaming about how the Jesus in the movie is not actually Jesus.Well...duh.The movie begins with a declaration that it's not based on the Gospels. Its first dramatic moments are of Jesus building crucifixes on which to hang Jewish zealots who were fighting the Roman Empire. It's not a challenge to the religion, but a challenge directed at the viewer, trying to separate the audience from its previous knowledge of Jesus and to take the story as it is on its own.That story follows the character of Jesus from a man tormented by the voice of God who then tries to discover how he should interpret that very same voice.
In the beginning he tries to block it out, but he can't do it. The attempt nearly drives him mad.He then embraces it as Love, to love everyone unconditionally (which manifests first at his defense of Mary Magdalene).He then embraces the axe, to bring about the Kingdom of God on Earth. This path comes to a head after the cleansing of the Temple when Jesus brings his disciples back to the Temple in order to tear it apart and bring about a very real revolution against Rome. Standing there, with the crowd at his back, and desperate for direction from God, he begins to bleed from his hands. God tells him there that he must suffer.Suffer he does. He insists to Judas that Judas must betray him, which he of course does. He is captured, tried, scourged, marched and ultimately crucified on the cross. In his final moments, an angel appears to Jesus and offers him respite. If God saved Isaac from Abraham's sacrifice, surely He would save His own, the angel explains. She removes him from the cross and leads him to marry Mary Magdalene. She passes and Jesus then begins a household with both Martha and Mary of Bethany where they start a family. Here, many years after the crucifixion, Jesus sees Paul in the town who talks of the crucifixion, death, and resurrection of Jesus. Jesus condemns him and calls him a liar. Paul scoffs saying that the story of Jesus was more important than the man he spoke to.Finally, the movie comes to Jesus on his deathbed. His disciples including Peter and Judas visit him for the first time in years. It is here that Judas condemns Jesus. The Son of Man was meant for more than this. ""What's good for man isn't good for God."" Judas then identifies the angel, who has been present in Jesus' life since the crucifixion, as Satan.Upon this revelation, Jesus struggles out of his house and shouts to God that he was too weak, but he's learned his lesson and wants to be crucified. Upon this declaration, Jesus returns to the moment that the angel took him down from the cross where he calls out, ""It is accomplished.""Battle Between the Spirit and the FleshMy appreciation of this movie tends to be personal rather than formal in nature, so I'm going to be using more personal pronouns than normal, but the question that comes to me when I finish the film is: How does this character of Jesus' journey relate to my own search for holiness in a world of sin?How many ways are there to interpret God's word? There are many. Just think of the different faiths that all follow Jesus. But in terms of the personal journey we all share, do we love each other unconditionally? Do we take up an axe to fight for God on this earth?I think that the movie comes to the conclusion that ultimately, no matter what path we chose, we must be willing to give it all away in the service of God up to and including our lives. It's not an easy thing. In the movie, the character of Jesus was taken away from his final pain and offered temporal salvation from a terrible fate, but it wasn't good enough. It provided him with temporal reprieve, but it left him unsatisfied and at a distance from God. Was that easy life favorable to the ultimate embrace with God in Heaven? The movie says no. It says that we must follow where God leads us, no matter what we have to give up in order to reach the destination.It's a hard message to take, and one that I understand Scorsese struggling with. The man once seriously considered pursuing a life in the priesthood, struggled with drugs, has been married five times, and lives a comfortable life detached from the kind of physical suffering common to humanity. He once told Roger Ebert that he thought that he knew he was going to go to Hell based on how he had lived his life. Scorsese seems like a man who struggles with the Catholic teachings of his youth, those that he has largely turned his back on, and how he lives his life everyday. The Last Temptation of Christ is that manifested in film.Going OutsideEnough about the interpretation of the movie. How does it look?
I have to say, I think this film is one of Scorsese's best looking films. Raging Bull's black and white photography is gorgeous. Silence's lush color palette is fantastic. However, The Last Temptation of Christ has a rugged and expansive look that Scorsese hadn't even attempted up to that point in his career. The vast majority of his films at that time were set in New York City and centered on small rooms and back alleys. Here, filming in Morocco, Scorsese took great advantage of the country's natural beauty and filmed so much of the film with mountains, lakes, and forests taking up space in the background of shots.It's really a testament to the simple step of taking a cheap production and going outside that can make a movie look far more expensive than it has any right to be. John Ford knew this when he kept going to Monument Valley. Terrence Malick shows this off in every movie. The French New Wave was essentially a bunch of kids wandering around Paris with a camera, and their movies looked like they were shot in one of the most expensive cities in the world (because they were).A Small Note on MusicI don't know if you have ever heard Pete Gabriel's score for the film, but do yourself a favor and check it out below. It's hard to imagine a more off-beat but beautifully arranged score, especially one that tries to announce the arrival of a film that is both so traditional (the Biblical epic) and so different at the same time.",The Last Temptation of Christ
41,Movie-ManDan,"Despite Being a Catholic I Loved This Movie, On All Levels.",10,12 October 2014,"This is one of the most controversial films ever made. It went so far as to be banned in certain countries and still is to this day. As a huge film buff, I love seeing controversial movies. Anything that bad captures my interest. I read that it was about Jesus's humanly struggles, living life as a mortal man and fathering children. I am a Catholic and knew the whole thing was a croc and the book and movie were made for controversy and shock. And boy, was I shocked in some parts. Some were simply weird and most were blasphemy. But it was done in such a way where I was just shocked instead of angry. That is great entertainment. When a movie can push my buttons the way this did, it deserves a high rating. Nikos Kasantsakis (the author) was Greek and Martin Scorsese (the director) is Italian and both are devout Catholics. So there's no reason why anybody else should feel angry when two major Catholics made this movie possible. I tried to put my religion aside and focus on the movie aspect, that's what it's all about. In every aspect of a movie, this rides high, some higher than others. The biggest achievement was the acting. Acting is one of my biggest concerns and one that I usually judge most. The entire cast was sensational, but of course, Dafoe shines the most as a doubtful Jesus Christ. He really deserved an Oscar win for his powerhouse performance. I'd say he was the closest to being at par with Robert Powell in Jesus Of Nazareth, whom I think is the best Jesus. If Dafoe was casted as Jesus in a nonfiction movie of Jesus's life, more people would have praised him. What I love about this too is that is tells why Jesus had to do what he did and why we need God in our lives. This actually gives straight answers that people always question. So that part is good that everyone must admit. The content is too harsh for people. Either way, this is one that people must experience at least once. Movie buffs and actors need to own this.4/4",The Last Temptation of Christ
42,justin-fencsak,Better than Mel Gibson,10,21 January 2019,"When this movie first came out more than 30 years ago it barely made back its budget due to the controversy surrounding the film, which, like the book, is set in an alternate universe in which jesus has a dream in which he gets off the cross and has a son with Mary Magdalene . In the end, Jesus dies, and the film reel ends abruptly. Compare that with the bigger budget Passion of the Christ, a far more popular movie among right wing Christians, and you'll see why this movie got more award love than the Mel Gibson movie, not to mention countless others after it. It ain't no Ben Hur or Ten Commandments, but this film is worthy of a purchase. I bought it for $1 at the local library and enjoyed the film despite its length. The score by Peter Gabriel is classic and the acting is well done. It's not for everyone.",The Last Temptation of Christ
43,eric262003,More Passion Here Than A Certain Mel Gibson Film,9,25 January 2016,"It's been well over two and a half decades since this classic film directed by Martin Scorsese came out and what a following it had and not always for the better I might add. Not that I had anything negative to say about it, but it did cause an uproarious impact to over zealous religious fanatics who thought this film was blasphemous and an insult to the Bible let alone God's beloved son Jesus Christ. And even after so many years one has to wonder why? What was the reason for any kind of outrage? The reason ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" angered the religious community was how Jesus Christ was portrayed. He was depicted not as a patron saint, but as a normal man who conveyed emotions, concerns, fears, doubt and acceptance for who he was. This story is about as real to the person as any other film that portrayed him and refrained from making Christ look like a storybook character, but a real human being with exceptional talents with believable emotions. And it never once goes against any message that Christ has preached about through the years. The opening scene in which Jesus Christ (Willem Dafoe) laying on the ground looks just like a picture page taken from the Bible. When he awakens we observe the man is in excruciating pain. During the course of time he is seen travel around from town to town, looking for knowledge as he remains both enthusiastic and fearful over what God has planned for him. One nailed to the cross The Devil persuades him to live a normal life as regular everyday person, married, with kids and an occupation which he gladly takes in. He eventually lives a fulfilling life as a mortal getting old and happy. While counting his last breaths as Jerusalem is in an inferno, he learns what he did wrong and pleads to his father for his wrong-doing and and to return to the cross and to die for everyone's sins. The humanistic plot point is that we get a better understanding of Jesus and why he sacrificed himself for the sake of our humanity. Whether he was a deity or a human is unimportant, the bottom line was that he was a great service to himself and to all of God's creatures big or small. The primary idiosyncrasy that makes this film more passionate than a certain anti-Semitic Mel Gibson interpretation was that director Martin Scorsese and scriptwriter Pal Schrader took the adaptation by Nikos Kanzantakis by detail and refrained from making it big-budgeted or grandeur. Though inspired by his predecessors from the 1950's he took his low-key interpretation and successfully kind spoke to the viewers instead of just making feel preachy and self-righteous. One of the primary things that turned people off about this movie was the usage of modernized dialect and the obvious New York accent by Harvey Keitel (Judas). My guess is that Scorsese just wanted to attract the moviegoers and to give them a indicator of what's happening in the scenes. If you wanted realism, the film should have been done in Hebrew with subtitles. If there was something that ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" ticked me off was the overabundance of major Hollywood stars. Sure they put in remarkable performances, but if they're just there to stuff money in their wallets than that is just unexceptional. Dafoe was an excellent choice in the role of Christ, but when regular Scorsese alums like Keitel, Harry Dean Stanton, Barbara Hershey no disrespect for David Bowie (RIP) playing supporting characters can be quite jarring at times. At least Scorsese corrected his mistake when he directed his next religious based film ""Kundun"" which was a career best for him.For me ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is truly right up there with other Scorsese greats like ""Taxi Driver"", ""Mean Streets"", and ""Raging Bull"". The conflicts depicted here are equally poignant in terms of being both spiritual as it was physical. It was still not close to ""Kundun"" where the spiritual revelation is in full effect. But ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" has enough charm and enlightenment to lure anyone for a chance to see a film about Jesus Christ in more humane form rather than as a caricature.",The Last Temptation of Christ
44,bkrauser-81-311064,One of Scorsese's Strongest Films,9,2 June 2017,"I recently saw A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies (1995), arguably one of the most extensive and accessible documentaries about American film. Scorsese brings you into the beautiful world he first discovered very young, populated with rich characters, reverence towards film technology and awe towards auteurs he had come to respect. His contribution to the world of modern cinema is history making in its own right. A seasoned director and producer, Scorsese has also taken upon himself to champion film preservation on behalf of not just Hollywood movies, but movies worldwide; something for which I truly admire.Other aspects of the iconoclast I respect beyond measure are his non-gangster related films. Don't get me wrong I love Goodfellas (1990), Casino (1995), The Departed (2006) et al. but his other prestige projects; Taxi Driver (1976), Raging Bull (1980) and, of course The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) hold a special place in my heart I must express. I consider those three films in particular, the staples of Scorsese's quest for absolution for which The Last Temptation is the culmination of his artistic expression during his early period.﻿﻿Scorsese has always said that if he hadn't caught the film bug and started pursuing pictures as a vocation, he would have become a priest. Indeed it was probably the filmmaker's religious instruction in youth that helped make Last Temptation and further inform its versatility, beauty universality. The film is in fact based on an immensely controversial book of the same name written by Nikos Kazantzakis. Both the film and book dares to expose the life of Jesus Christ as both human and divine, filled with both holy obligation and temporal temptation. The film diminishes Jesus in the eyes of some, making him out to be frail, afraid and even pedestrian. ﻿ I won't bore you with the actual plot of Last Temptation as it, for the most part comports with biblically recorded events. The difference is in the mind of its central character. Unlike Nicholas Ray's King of Kings (1961) or some of the earlier Hollywood hagiographies, Jesus is dispossessed of symbol status. He is not quite clear on his purpose and in the tradition of Abraham questions the decisions made by God. It is through his faults that the Devil finds a way into his tortured soul. In the 2/3rds mark, the devil, which up until then takes the temporal shape of a serpent, tempts Jesus with life free from godly responsibility. In a haze brought on by crucifixion, Jesus imagines living the life of a normal Judean plebeian, falling in love with Mary Magdalene, having children and dying of old age.﻿﻿﻿﻿Ultimately unfettered by the Devil's temptations, Jesus ultimately makes the choice to become the sacrificial Lamb of God, thus securing his divine status. Yet it was that very temptation among other liberties that made Christians go absolutely bonkers about The Last Temptation of Christ. Groups boycotted the film for its supposed blasphemies and religious extremists even firebombed the St. Michael Theatre in Paris during its theatrical release injuring ten. In the fervor of the film's release many of its detractors hurt their cause by purporting the Jews of Hollywood were out to destroy their religion.Destroy? I much doubt it. If anything Martin Scorsese's film is life and faith affirming. The film accepts and celebrates the Christian divinity of Jesus Christ while exposing an uncommon characterization that is much more believable. Not only believable but expresses the very thing that made Christ an important figure, his humanity! Furthermore the film creates a historical context which helps explain simultaneously how someone like Jesus could have existed and why his teachings were so prevalent and dangerous to the likes of Pontius Pilate and the Roman Empire.The Last Temptation of Christ is ultimately about a man who fights and ultimately accepts his narrative through faith in sacrifice. Nine years after hospitalization and treatment for cocaine addiction, Scorsese was no doubt galvanized by its message of a man fighting inner demons.While Last Temptation was made eight years after Raging Bull and twelve years after Taxi Driver, with four feature length films in- between I place Last Temptation among the triptych because they depict personal struggles on the part of the protagonists which mirror Martin Scorsese's own struggles with addiction. But while Raging Bull ends ruefully and Taxi Driver nihilistically, Last Temptation comes full circle, ending with a spiritual affirmation that even staunch zealots cannot deny.",The Last Temptation of Christ
45,denis888,A Blasphemous Shameless Caricature on Our Lord,1,6 November 2006,"I know, this is Postmodernism, I know this is the age of total depravity, relativism and falsely understood tolerance. This means that anyone can come and distort, falsify, crook and bent any sacred and holy idea. I am a Protestant Fundamentalist, I am a Russian Protestant and I am extremely annoyed with this total flop of Mr Scorcese as a film maker and as a visionary. Why? Why does it happen that everybody can do almost any terrible thing on Christianity and then we must be simply shut up? Are we afraid to be called Fanatics or Shallow people? If this means to stand for our Faith, then I am one of them. This is not a film, this is a definite, shameless, open and total attack on our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. The very idea that he had some lustful relations with a woman and then had a family is a terrible and merciless distortion of The Bible. But let that be. All those attacks have been constant all 2000 years and will go on, till the end of times. Let Mr. Scorcese and Willem Defoe answer for this unpardonable sinful deed later, now we may say with some pleasure that in fact the film is very bad. If it were at least a good film, then a critique would be a hard task. But, with the second-rate low-profile ditty as it is, this is not a problem.

We all know where it leads at.",The Last Temptation of Christ
46,tomsview,Be tempted,8,2 May 2018,"After all the fuss that was made at the time of the release of this movie I expected it to be more shocking than it is.Scorsese's movie gives us a troubled Jesus played by Daniel Defoe. He does not embrace the role of saviour of mankind easily. He is tempted by Satan often, and at the end we are given his alternative life if he had succumbed to those temptations, especially that of the flesh in the form of Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene. It's this aspect of the film that got the placards waving and the picket lines outside the theatres in 1988.I have some sympathy for people who were offended (not for the violence though). Maybe the fullest interpretation of the meaning of blasphemy is not just insulting the name of God, but insulting anyone's deeply held beliefs. However, all things considered, I don't think this film does that. ""Last Temptation"" is actually a thoughtful exploration of Jesus coming to terms with his relationship with God, reinforcing much that is in the Gospels - I was surprised so many miracles were included. An element that does have shock value (although drawn from 
Kazantzakis' novel) is Jesus producing custom crosses for the Romans. And what were all those naked women doing hanging out with John the Baptist? It seemed inspired more by Woodstock than events at the River Jordan.With that said, I have always been fascinated by films that approach the life of Jesus obliquely or interpret it in a new way such as ""Risen"", ""The Body"", ""The Word"", and 1961's ""Barabbas"". A book that also did this in a compelling way was Robin Maugham's ""The Sign"" about a life paralleling that of Jesus. ""Last Temptation"" is not unlike ""Jesus Christ Superstar"". It is a stylised reinterpretation through a modern lens. Topping off the similarities, Peter Gabriel's score is a blend of Middle Eastern music and new age electronics with the most triumphant track playing over the credits following the crucifixion.This film doesn't deny the existence of Christ nor does it refute his otherworldliness. But this path to the cross is not the one trodden by Jeffery Hunter in ""King of Kings"" or Max von Sydow in ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"". If anything, this one goes more via the psychiatrist's couch.",The Last Temptation of Christ
47,pyrocitor,Deeply affecting and starkly thought-provoking spiritual reflection,9,5 March 2008,"When one considers the heated public outcry when a new film presents a spiritual representation which deviates even slightly from the traditional and widely accepted portrayal, it is really no surprise that the vast majority of cinematic biblical adaptations often result as irritatingly earnest and painfully politically correct children's stories. Seldom does a film come along which demonstrates genuine spiritual reflection or inquiry, which dares to question and reflect upon the age old myths of the bible and attempt to make sense of them in a contemporary context. With that in mind, the tremendous accolades which director Martin Scorsese deserves become abundantly clear, for daring to stand up against the mainstream and the ensuing controversy and delivering The Last Temptation of Christ: a tremendously reflective, fiercely thought-provoking and endlessly captivating rumination on the journey of Jesus Christ, embracing the inherent humanity as well as divinity of the figure.It is impossible to imagine such a monumental undertaking being anywhere near as much of a success in the hands of a less capable or reflective director than Scorsese, whose passion and dedication to his cause seem to bleed onto the screen. Working from Nikos Kazantzakis' equally controversial novel (a disclaimer declares the film as merely a reflection rather than biblical truth), Scorsese's most spiritually personal work bristles with vivacity and soul, presenting a genuinely harrowing struggle with spirituality and faith, mirroring the director's own religious ruminations. Intensely controversial for its portrayal of Jesus as ultimately human, and experiencing very human struggles, flaws and temptations throughout his spiritual journey, the film dares to capture the psychological struggle and sacrifices of Christ in a haunting and undeniably affecting fashion. Paul Schrader's sparse script is a masterful piece of work, pounding with torment and reflective fatalism, and while some of Jesus' reflective voiceovers toe the line of melodrama, never before have the guilt, resentment, fear and spiritual struggle of Christ been encompassed with such power and conviction.While the film's slow, thoughtful pacing may drag at times, the seemingly tangible mood of doubt and fatalism is overwhelmingly affecting, using its lengthy running time to full effect. Scorsese's cinematography and editing are sublime, masterfully capturing the arid scenery with a bleak artistry, and Brian Eno's haunting and captivating score heightens the emotional tension to a nearly peerless point.Without the appropriate cast to fully drive home the emotional impact of his story it is distinctly possible to imagine Scorsese's masterpiece falling flat, but thankfully the masterful cast rise to the incredible challenge of bringing such a complex and emotionally challenging vision to life. While seemingly an unorthodox choice, it is impossible to imagine an actor inhabiting the indescribably difficult role of Jesus with more compassion and dignity than Willem Dafoe. Strikingly powerful and thoroughly moving, Dafoe conveys Jesus' overwhelming internal struggle with a grim stoicism, as an ultimately human figure struggling with his pending divinity, seduced by the allure of regular humanity - a flooring work that Dafoe has seldom matched since.In contrast, the disappointing miscasting of Harvey Keitel as the troubled Judas, fated to betray Jesus, proves to be one of the film's few misfires. Despite his intensely powerful and rawly emotional performance, Keitel, with his fiery red hair and unmistakable New York accent always seems out of place, and despite his best efforts, his casting only serves to dampen the film's quality. However, Barbara Hershey is a tremendously powerful presence as Mary Magdalene, representative of Jesus' main struggle with his humanity (and the source of the bulk of the film's controversy) and David Bowie makes a strong impact in a single scene as the reflective Pontius Pilate.In turn disturbing, troubling, haunting and emotionally draining, the sheer visceral impact of Scorsese's labour of love is an irrefutable testament to the film's outstanding quality. With nearly peerless emotional resonance and a fiercely dynamic lead performance, The Last Temptation of Christ can hardly be called an easy watch, but for viewers (religious or not) willing to undergo a profound spiritual and philosophical reflection (and brave the initial controversy) or to simply bask in the masterful command of the cinematic form demonstrated, the film proves ultimately rewarding in a way most films can only allude to.-9/10",The Last Temptation of Christ
48,gizmomogwai,"To be crucified, or not to be crucified?",8,1 August 2012,"I've been curious to see The Last Temptation of Christ since I first heard of it, watching a documentary about Martin Scorsese as a kid (before I ever saw a movie by Martin Scorsese). I'm not a Christian but I still tend to be interested in religion and Jesus himself. Naturally, I'm not going to be upset about unorthodox artistic depictions.Actually, I don't think there's too much to get upset about. The Jesus depicted in this movie is still Christ. Just look at the title- it recognizes him as Christ. God is still his father and Satan is still his enemy. He still turns water into wine. He is depicted as having sins, which might rub some the wrong way. Then again, in chapter 10 of Mark, when Jesus is called good, he replies ""Why do you call me good? Only God is truly good."" It is bold of this movie, though, to depict him as starting out making crosses for the Romans, being branded by Judas as a ""Jew killing Jews."" As well, the movie endorses the theory about Mary Magdalene being a prostitute, which scholars and The Da Vinci Code have questioned lately. But doesn't it send a good message that people can change? Is it much different from Moses living among the Egyptians before he discovered he was a Jew? The biggest departure from the Gospels is only within the last thirty minutes or so, but it's only temporary and it's also the most interesting part of the movie. An angel played by Juliette Caton takes Jesus off the cross in a vision or alternate reality of Jesus. She cites the story of Abraham not having to sacrifice his son. She is played quite well be Caton (as with Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver, Scorsese knows how to pick child actresses). But it turns out she's Satan coming to prevent the act that saves mankind. Jesus prays for God to undo the error, which he does, and Jesus dies on the cross as he is supposed to.In the process, we get a powerful story of a man wrestling with faith, which is universal. Many have doubts, and in this movie even Jesus doesn't know if he is the messiah. The opening identifies this story as fictional, and indeed, it is probably best to think of it as a metaphor. The Last Temptation of Christ may be preachy at times, the Doctor Dolittle aspect with Jesus talking to animals may be a little silly, but generally it is an interesting, provocative story with passion and faith.",The Last Temptation of Christ
49,adamscastlevania2,"A well made film, with a touch of risk",6,18 January 2015,"(60%) A picture that up to a point is hard to know why it's deemed overtly controversial by so many different people, as most of what happens is widely accepted as key events that actually happened to Christ according to followers of Christianity. So there's the turning of water into wine, healing the blind, the last supper etc. But then towards the later stages there are some scenes that are more risky that do break away from the accepted story. Willem Dafoe is one of the better screen actors to play Jesus, with Harvey Keitel as the very serious Judas adding intensity. Despite this being a touch too long, it's still very well made/acted, and despite it being very odd at times, the writing and structure is surprisingly simple and easy to follow. This is worth a look for all cinema fans, but it's not something many would want to watch again and again unlike Scorsese's better films.",The Last Temptation of Christ
50,KnightsofNi11,Nothing like it,8,16 December 2011,"The story of Jesus Christ is one of the oldest and most epic tales in history. Whether it is true or not doesn't matter. The point is that we can all agree it's an incredible tale, fact or fiction. Many films have been made recounting the story of Jesus of Nazareth, but few have been as brutal and as fascinating as Martin Scorsese's take on the tale in The Last Temptation of Christ. It's a controversial film that explores the notion of whether Jesus was a real Messiah or not. It focuses on the battle of flesh and spirit that raises so many of the questions in Jesus' life. The film is endearing and intriguing, as well as being an immaculate piece of art.This is a film where it is imperative that you take it as a film and nothing else. I don't believe that Martin Scorsese was trying to create an uprising with his film. Instead, he chose to explore the timeless story of Jesus Christ and analyze it from the perspective of the flesh versus spirit conflict. It is certainly more than just another retelling of the story, but it isn't meant to infuriate people because it is only a film. And it is a film that should be appreciated for what it accomplishes. It tells the story of Jesus from such a fascinating vantage point, humanizing Jesus, giving him all the flaws of us mortals and making his story one of internal and external conflict. There are certain things within this film that we rarely see in a telling of Jesus' story. I don't want to give anything away but there are quite a few fascinating aspects that makes The Last Temptation of Christ an exquisite film.Not only is it fascinating and challenging, it's also an aesthetic wonder. The film is full of immaculate set pieces and glorious landscape shots that will take your breath away. It's an epic scale production for an epic scale story. Martin Scorsese captures the BC era Jerusalem with an ingenious eye for detail and a respect for the magnitude of his project. The film will blow you away in all its glory and vastness that can only be captured correctly by a genius like Scorsese. There are some hauntingly memorable shots all throughout this film that give new images to the name of Christ; images we have always associated with the man but never to the aesthetic prowess that Scorsese displays.Clocking in at close to three hours long, The Last Temptation of Christ is admittedly drawn out and accomplishes a lot in its time span, but I'm not sure to what end. The last 45 minutes is really what matters most about this film and what sets it apart from other films about Jesus. Everything before that is just build up, throwing in lots of food for thought which is, at times, a little tedious. Yet all in all this film is quite the spectacle. It's one of Scorsese's most ambitious and daring projects to date, and possibly one of his more memorable. Obviously I can't compare it to the likes of Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The Departed, or Raging Bull, but The Last Temptation of Christ is certainly one of a kind.",The Last Temptation of Christ
51,khanbaliq2,The ultimate labor of love and a singularly thought-provoking take on the life of Jesus.,8,11 September 2010,"The acting in The Last Temptation Of Christ is impeccable, and the sense of place and time, and the high drama of the situation, are all palpable. While suffering crucifixion, Jesus (Willem Dafoe) is stricken with self-doubt about his destiny as the son of God, and contemplates living like an ordinary man.The film is a provocative and deeply-felt account of Christ's last hours, shot and written sympathetically, without resorting to sensationalism. In fact, director Martin Scorsese errs (understandably) on the side of reverence; it diligently poses a dilemma in a way that might inspire debate rather than hysteria.",The Last Temptation of Christ
52,gab-14712,A Film That Is Meant to Challenge!,8,10 November 2021,"I'll be the first one to admit that I despised Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ upon initial viewing. I was expecting a movie based on the traditional Gospels, which certainly is not this movie. Years later, after changing my mindset, gave the film another chance. While still a little long, I clicked with the film. As a Christian, we were taught Jesus is both man and God. Scorsese explored the man side of Jesus. What if Jesus, instead of dying and resurrecting for our sins, fell wayward from Satan and fell into temptation? That is the fundamental question that Scorsese and his screenwriter Paul Schrader asked. Schrader wrote two of Scorsese's best films in Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, so once again they collaborate on creating a challenging, engaging feature that asks important questions about beliefs, passions, and morality. I will say this. Even though I initially did not like the film, there are these striking images that stay with you and haunt you. Ditto for my second viewing. Michael Ballhaus created some incredible, striking visuals with the camera. The performances are (mostly) excellent and I think this film has one of the best portrayals of Satan.The film is based off Nikos Kazantzakis's fictional novel which received much controversy because of a story it told about Jesus of Nazareth but not saying true to the Bible. Scorsese and Schrader originally intended to adapt the film after The King of Comedy, but Paramount eventually canceled the film because of a ballooning budget and the protest letters the studio received from Christian groups. The director made After Hours instead. In 1986, Universal was interested and Scorsese made the film on a smaller budget. It was a challenging shoot for the production. It was shot on location in Morocco, and they needed to hurry because of unrest...which is why Scorsese's film had minor aesthetic appeal to it. Still, they managed to use visuals in a way that audiences will remember despite minimal location shooting.Even more infamous than the film itself is the controversy that surrounded the film. The main reason for this controversy was because people did not like the idea that the life of Jesus Christ was told differently from the Gospel. I was initially shocked when I saw the film, but it enhanced my understanding for my second go-around. It is a movie, and each film has its own unique meaning and interpretation. Still, many Christian groups protested the movie. A Christian group actually delivered a terrorist attack on a French cinema. Many countries banned the movie and some still instill a ban on the movie. It is crazy what a movie can do. I say just give the movie a chance and formulate your own opinion.Jesus of Nazareth (Willem Dafoe) is a carpenter...and also the Son of God. He is tormented by demons including Satan himself, he hates that he has to make crosses for the Romans, he has all these feelings for the people of the world, and of course adheres to the word of His Father. As he nears fulfillment of his mission, he faces the greatest temptation of all. The mortal life of a man.Willem Dafoe is fantastic as Jesus. His job was to make Jesus as humane as possible and certainly succeeded with all of these temptations. I will admit I was not in full agreement with Harvey Keitel's portrayal of Judas. Keitel is a legendary actor, but he did not seem right for the role. Barbara Hershey is a great Mary Magdalene. One of the reasons why the film is deemed so controversial is a scene of consummation between Jesus and Mary. That scene gave Jesus even more human characteristics. Also, David Bowie as Pontius Pilate! That was inspired casting (although originally, the role was meant for Sting).Overall, The Last Temptation of Christ is not based on Gospel or reality. It is based off a fictional novel that allows Jesus to be more human. It is a challenging watch and will make you question some things. That is what Scorsese does when he is at his best. In the eyes of many, Scorsese had a lukewarm 80's. He ended the decade with a bang despite the film not being a box office success. It helps that he worked with Schrader and a solid cast led by the fantastic Willem Dafoe. I cannot forget to mention Peter Gabriel's score. I loved it and his music actually made more people interested in world music. It did for me at least. Anyway, no matter who or what you believe in, give Scorsese's passion project a chance. It took me a few tries, but I am glad I did. More proof exists that Scorsese is probably the best director the cinematic world has ever seen.My Grade: B+",The Last Temptation of Christ
53,itamarscomix,A unique and fascinating view of the Gospels,9,24 May 2005,"Maybe the fact that I wasn't offended by this film has something to do with me being an atheist Jew; I can certainly understand why it offended and was considered blasphemous by many others. Despite growing up as a Jew in Israel and having no connection to Christianity, I have long been fascinated by the story of Jesus and the many different cinematic and literary interpretations of it, be it humorous (Monty Python's 'Life Of Brian'), musical (Andrew Lloyd Webber's 'Jesus Christ Superstar') or authentic. Martin Scorsese's 'Last Temptation Of Christ', based on Nikos Kazantaki's novel of the same name, takes a very original and unusual view on the life of Christ, and sheds a light on him that is both criticizing and sympathetic, presenting him to be a much more human-like character than we are used to expect. With much help from inspired and brilliant acting by Willem Defoe - certainly not anyone's first choice for the character, who approaches this very difficult character as originally as Scorsese does - the master director does extremely well in creating this unusual version of Christ, and makes him understandable and recognizable in a whole new way. Originality and controversy aside, 'The Last Temptation Of Christ' is a wonderful masterpiece of cinema, and one of Scorsese's most impressive works, standing with greats like 'Taxi Driver' and 'Raging Bull' in suspense and atmosphere. His directing and the photography are superb, and he transfers the story of Jesus to the big screen like few others could. Also praiseworthy are many members of the cast - Barbara Hershey is spectacular as Mary Magdalene, as are Harry Dean Stanton as Paul and, in a surprisingly good casting choice, David Bowie (that's right!) as Pilate. Harvey Keitel as Judas Iscariot supplies a good match for Defoe's Christ, but he really is the weaker link in the bunch, as he is not nearly as original as the rest of the cast. Finally, I must mention the great genius Mr. Peter Gabriel, who supplied for this film one of the most brilliant and groundbreaking musical scores to appear in a motion picture, which adds enormously to its atmosphere. It can be obtained on audio CD under the title 'Passion: Music For The Last Temptation Of Christ', and remains a landmark of progressive and avant-garde music.If you're open-minded and are not afraid of breaking of taboos, 'The Last Temptation Of Christ' is by all means an essential. Do try to take it for what it is and not to be offended, because the film is not intended as a documentation of the life of Christ or criticism against him; it is merely an interpretation of that timeless story, which tries - and succeeds - to shed new light on it. Watch it, and you'll never think of the Gospels in the same way again.",The Last Temptation of Christ
54,RJBurke1942,The Last Temptation of Christ-1988: A fictional account about the Ultimate Truth.,7,18 August 2007,"Such a title implies that, whatever your beliefs about the nature and life of Jesus Christ, he was a man, born of woman and subject to the temptations that all men and women experience.That this narrative portrays Christ first as man, and second as son of God, clearly illustrates the philosophical underpinnings of the author's novel and Scorsese's (an ex-priest himself) film and makes it all the more believable and feasible that Christ had many doubts about his role. Indeed, it is well know that, in Gethsemane, he begged to be released from the need for crucifixion; moreover, he cried out in anguish about being abandoned while suffering on the cross  both indicative of all too-human reactions.So, that aspect should not upset any people who believe in the sanctity of Christ. If it does, that says more about the quality of their own belief than in the truth of the portrayal.What should upset them more is the manner in which the narrative turns the betrayal of Christ on its head - a truly imaginative and thought provoking perspective that had not occurred to me, growing up, as I did, steeped in the Christian faith. That part of my life is long gone, but the fascination with Christ  arguably the first political dissident who changed the world  remains (Karl Marx probably comes in second).I first saw this film ten years ago, and saw it again just recently. Time has not dimmed the effectiveness of Scorsese's direction and the acting by the stellar cast. While Willem Dafoe takes the role of Jesus in his stride, I think most kudos go to Harvey Keitel as Judas Iscariot, shown as a political opportunist who wants to see the Romans crushed and the Kingdom of God established on earth; Judas is, alas, the ultimate man who missed the ultimate point. Special mention goes to Harry Dean Stanton as Saul the tax collector (later St. Paul) while Barbara Hershey is very effective as Mary Magdalene. David Bowie's (almost) cameo appearance as Pontius Pilate was adroitly casual, if not entirely indifferent about the man on trial.The value in this narrative is that there may be more real truth in it than in some of the Gospels that were, after all, written many years after the actual crucifixion. Time, as we know, has a habit of playing tricks on our memories.This is not the movie for hard-core believers in the New Testament. It's a finely stated exposition of a point of view about the nature of our humanity and one that demands consideration, whether or not you believe in God and an afterlife: very much a departure for Scorsese but one that is well worth the time to see.",The Last Temptation of Christ
55,cinematic_aficionado,Temptation to underestimate this film,8,16 May 2009,"The film's opening credits are as follows: ""The dual substance of Christ – the yearning so human, so superhuman, of man to attain God... has always been a deep inscrutable mystery to me. My principal anguish and source of all my joys and sorrows, from my youth onward has been the incessant merciless battle between the spirit and the flesh and my soul is the arena where these two armies, have clashed and met."" This film is not based upon the gospels, but upon this fictional exploration of the eternal spiritual conflict. All Christians become familiar with Jesus the Son of Man, the Son of God. Nikos Kazantzakis created a portrait of the Theanthrope, the GodMan showing more of a hypothetical Jesus' Man side, or perhaps the ManGod. We see Jesus struggling with this identity, he finds the bearing of carrying God's will onto the world to much for him to handle and at times he resends it. At one point in the film he says:""God loves me I know he loves me, but I want him to stop, I want him to hate me"". Later on he says ""You think it's blessing to know what God wants?"" It is possible that most men, would find that unbearable, impossible had they found themselves in such mission. The question perhaps to be raised here is, how can one do God's will, without ever giving in to the temptations of the flesh? Whilst we see a Christ free of sin, he is exposed to all human temptations such as fear, doubt, depression, reluctance and lust. This is also shown when Jesus is led, presumable by an angel, to a brothel and mumbles: ""here I am where I least wish to be."" Again though exposed to temptation, he remains free of sin and just walks away. The Jesus Christians know, was well aware of the fate that awaited him and faced it with humility and grace. The ManGod of this film feared the cross, did not want it to happen. Also the real Jesus, free from human passions (not compassion), did want to eradicate evil from the world but here he says: ""I believed in love, but now I believe in the axe. I want to cut the devil's throat."" Once more, we see a man aware of is mission here on earth but being a man has high levels of testosterone and uses language the Jesus of the gospels doesn't. Towards the end the ""last temptation"" does emerge. It is the devil, who visits Christ on the cross in the form of an angel, offering to release him from the suffering of crucifixion. Once this is done, Christ then leads an ordinary life and experiences human love, intimacy with women, fatherhood and a regular job. It is at this point, that the writer tried to tell us that had Christ chose this path it would eventually catch on with him. We then see a very powerful scene of an elderly Christ surrounded by his disciples and Judas in particular who criticizes him of cowardice saying, ""no sacrifice (for mankind), no salvation (of the mankind)"" and ""what is good for man, isn't good for God"" prompting Christ to repent asking his father to ""take him back"" (to the cross). There we see him on the cross and although in a lot of pain and anguish, he is relieved that his mission is accomplished. Just like the book, This film caused a great deal of controversy; the Roman Catholic church banished the screening, in Greece several screens were burned and when the book was published in 1951 the Greek Orthodox church renounced Nikos Kazantzakis and when he passed away 6 years later he was refused a funeral. In the UK, though the film was shown on live TV seven years after it was released, it still tops the list of most complained about TV programmes. It took several years before it was screened in many countries and still is banned in some. It is totally clear why accusations of blasphemy were voiced for this story and for any Christian, it would be shocking to watch this. However, somehow it seems to me this was not written in a disrespectful spirit but from an overwhelming affection towards Jesus. An affection and admiration so strong, that this great literary mind struggled to come to terms with His dual substance and decided to pen a more human side of Him, and Scorsese faithfully brought this vision to the big screen.",The Last Temptation of Christ
56,chaswe-28402,Had me puzzled,4,16 August 2016,"Embarking on this lengthy trip with no prior preparation was baffling. Force fed since childhood with all the stories in the bible, I still could make little sense of what was going on. I had not read the book by Kazantzakis. Fortunately, this site provides a number of explanations, partially dispelling my obtuseness. The solution is actually fairly simple, as I now see it. The Last Temptation is the impulse to lead a normal life: keep working at carpentry, marry, have children and grow old. Pay god minimal attention. The film is an extremely roundabout way of presenting this argument, and I couldn't really swallow it. I thought Dafoe was quite good as Christ: he conveyed a kind of demon-like godfulness. Some might find this off-putting, but it tied in with the angelic little Satan towards the end. Although the movie is very long, and continued for another 30 minutes after it seemed to end, it was worth watching, but not worth watching twice. I note that apparently I did watch it 7 or 8 years ago, but had totally forgotten what it was about. Those several years ago I see I noted that John the Baptist had a good line in the plot, when he said that ""The God of Israel is the God of the Desert. If you want to speak to him, go to the desert"". Sadly, this is true of the god of Israel: vengeful, punitive and jealous, modelled on the sun blazing down in those barren, arid regions. I prefer the pagan gods of the temperate zone. Beauty, reason, creativity. I was going to give this 8 stars, but I've changed my mind. It annoyed me: 4 stars.",The Last Temptation of Christ
57,majikstl,...they know not what they do.,1,7 March 2004,"THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST features a character who is warm, gentle, soft-spoken and wise. Unfortunately, that character, played by rock icon David Bowie, is Pontius Pilate, the man who condemns Jesus to death on the cross. Jesus, on the other hand, is played -- rather badly -- by Willem Dafoe as a whiny, self-absorbed, neurotic, bumbling, somewhat stupid, amazingly uninspired, and occasionally hysterical twit.
Martin Scorsese's fictionalized -- as if that is a good thing -- retelling of Christ's story is offensive on so many levels that you don't have to be a Christian or even a believer in any faith to be dumbfounded by the sheer ineptitude of the entire project. When Scorsese begins the story with Christ the carpenter busy in his shop using his skills to build a cross which will be used to crucify a fellow Jew, the story has nowhere to go but up. Amazingly, it doesn't: the next scene finds Jesus tagging along to lend a helping hand as the Romans carry out the execution. Here is the story of the Prince of Peace, a man worshiped and adored for his belief in nonviolence, forgiveness and human kindness, and the film begins with him helping to commit a state sanctioned killing. One would assume that the filmmaker has a pronounced hatred of Jesus and of Christianity.This presumably is not the case. Benefit of the doubt dictates that Scorsese is genuinely trying to create a sympathetic vision of Jesus. Thus, Scorsese wants us to see Jesus as human, but it is his concept of humanity that the director presents. Being human in Scorsese's eyes is being Travis Bickle, Jake LaMotta, one of the savage beasts in GOODFELLAS or any number of psychotic losers that populate his films. The notion that God sent forth his only son to be an example of the best that mankind should strive for fits nowhere into Scorsese bleak and sorrowful mindset. The fact that Scorsese sees the world through such a cloud of contempt is pitiable. The fact that feels the need to vandalize the story of Christ with such a blatant hatefulness is less worthy of forgiveness.Using Paul Schrader's woefully insipid screenplay, Scorsese's film, more or less, follows the standard Gospels, up until a fantasy ending that supposedly justifies the entire film. So it's not the story, it's the telling. Jesus tells a parable about hope and faith and he handles it so badly that his listeners want to riot and kill the rich. He disowns his mother and leaves her crying in the street. Simple questions about faith leave him stammering and dumbfounded. There is not a moment in the film that gives Jesus a chance to show kindness, wisdom, love, charisma or even a shred of dignity. The only element of the film that does work is the climatic dream sequence wherein Jesus imagines what life would be like if he renounced his divinity and lived as an average man. Ironically, once the presence of God is removed form Jesus, the film allows him to actually have genuine positive human qualities.Brushing aside -- as if were possible -- the utter ignorance THE LAST TEMPTATION shows of the Gospels, the film still fails. Aside from Bowie's credible cameo appearance, the actors flounder, either resorting to horribly stilted line readings or else sounding like blue collar workers arguing at the local tavern. Dafoe, however, stands alone: playing Jesus like an escaped mental patient, the otherwise competent actor seems to have had not a clue as to who Jesus was and apparently he got precious little guidance from Scorsese. Even Scorsese's admitted technical prowess fails him here; the film is cheap, clumsy and unpleasant to look at.Is the film sacrilege? That is a judgment for others to make. What it is is insensitive. It callously shows contempt for a figure who is revered, not only in Christian faiths, but in Jewish and Muslim faiths as well. To present such a degraded image of Christ, even within a ""fictionalized"" or ""what-if"" scenario, doesn't excuse the filmmakers from their responsibility to show respect, if not honesty, to the historical, if not religious, importance of the Christ. To hide behind the concept of ""fictionalization"" is a cowardly cop-out.This is a cold, hateful and mean-spirited film. The irony is that the Scorsese and his team probably thought they were making a film with great inspirational insight. Forgive them, for they know not what they do.",The Last Temptation of Christ
58,PyrolyticCarbon,Great performance from Dafoe in a well directed but harshly cut religious epic,6,20 March 2005,"I'm a big fan of those old religious epics, The Robe, The Ten Commandments, those old Sunday movies with the real Stars of Hollywood. Huge stories, huge stars, huge emotion and huge entertainment, fantastic.However todays epic religious movie is more about challenging belief, presenting new historical findings, and being controversial. For me that's lost all the passion of the religious epic. Strange I feel this way considering I'm not even religious. However, late night the other week I happened to come across Last Temptation on the Channel 4 Banned Film season, and I gave it a chance.Good job I did too as it turns out it does retain a lot of that epic feel to it. There's a load of recognisable stars, big acting and huge stories, but still retaining that modern challenging and controversial stance.Willem Dafoe is simply stunning as Christ, pulling a painfully emotive performance and showing amazing presence when called for. He almost looks like a man possessed, which is perhaps the idea.Barbara Hershey plays Mary Magdalene who is on screen far too briefly. Harvey Keitel is perhaps the weak link here and doesn't perform well in his role as Judas. There are some quieter moments when he brings through compassion and his love for Christ very well, but when he portrays some stronger emotional feelings it does seem to come through as out of place.Overall the story is an interesting one, and looking outside of the whole religious aspect, I personally can't see the reason for the upset. It portrays the final temptation that Satan offers to Christ while he dies upon the cross. For someone who doesn't believe, I find that this only strengthens the aspect of the story and lifts the ideals and triumph of the story and of the character of Christ even higher.It's a well directed movie, and there are some really hard hitting moments, obviously being written and directed by those with a real passion for the subject matter. However it does feel that it leaps about, since this story is just a well visited one there are great leaps in the timeline, and it concentrates on certain acts that are deemed relevant to build to the final temptation. Yet I feel that negatively affects the building of the other characters and the story itself. It's as though it's taken for granted that we know the story and we're only going to be shown the newer, controversial aspects.",The Last Temptation of Christ
59,iamjamalwhite,Offensive and not scriptural,1,13 December 2019,"There are ""smart people"" on here giving reviews saying this is a loving and accurate adaptation of the book in which Jesus grapples with humanity including lust for everyone around him (to include his disciples). Um ... that ain't normal. If you have never read the Bible, have jazz hands and have an IQ under 100, this is the movie for you. Don't listen to the critics who say it is a loving depiction of blah, blah, blah. It is blasphemy, offensive, one of the worst things ever put on film. Skip this and save your soul!",The Last Temptation of Christ
60,avik-basu1889,"Jesus, the man !!!",9,27 April 2017,"'The Last Temptation of Christ' is an exceptionally interesting film in the context of Christianity and morality. It famously received widespread criticism for being blasphemous. From a certain standpoint, it is blasphemous because instead of focusing of Christ's divinity, it uses Jesus as a metaphor for man and a representative of the human condition. I can understand why some Christians might have objections with this portrayal. But as a non- Christian myself, I found myself utterly engaged and enraptured by this exploration of Jesus' humanity.The gospels give us the idea that although Christ was presented with a lot of worldly temptations and even though he did have a moment of doubt, he did in the end manage to wholeheartedly turn his back on them. But this film and the book it is based on paints a more complicated picture. Here it is proposed that Christ found it really difficult to turn his back on the normal, peaceful life. We see Jesus tied down and tortured by the idea of predeterminism. It is shown in the beginning that Jesus subconsciously is making crosses for Romans to make God hate him so that he leaves him alone. His yearning for a life as a husband and live with a wife like Magdalene or the sisters of Bethany continued to exist throughout his short life. The film proposes the idea that even after the crucifixion, Christ had this moment of fantasy wish-fulfilment of a different life, almost like a parallel universe where he turns his back on God and lives like a normal man.Another essential element of Christ's character in this film is his constant and relentless search for his role and purpose on Earth and what God wants from him. He constantly seeks out and looks for signs and metaphors to understand God's will. He is constantly asking questions and pleading God to give him a sign and tell him what to do. This again grounds the mystique of Christ and makes him human. He is just like all of us(in a little more heightened way). Even he is for the most part very unsure about his life, his purpose and his future on Earth.The representation of Judas in this film is fascinating. Conventional ideas and interpretations paint Judas as the guy who betrays Jesus. As a matter of fact, the name Judas itself has become synonymous with betrayal. However in this film, Judas' character is far more complicated and layered compared to the traitor that we generally visualise when thinking of him. At the beginning of the film, Judas comes across like the guy who is far more sure of himself and his ideas and views than Jesus and he also shows a lot of initiative in marching a revolt against the Romans. He also shows true belief in Jesus' ideas and views once Jesus decides to become a preacher. The 'betrayal' that Judas indulges in has everything to do the idea of predeterminism and nothing to do with his evilness. Judas gets successfully persuaded by Jesus himself to execute the betrayal as that betrayal itself was going to be the catalyst that will lead to Jesus' crucifixion and hence the saving of man's soul. So this film paints a morally upstanding picture of Judas who has to become evil because of his predetermined role in the bigger universal law set by God. This actually makes Judas comparable to the character of Mr. Glass in 'Unbreakable' in the way that the both eventually sacrifice their free will to uphold their predetermined fates even if that means becoming a symbol of evil. Judas is a hero in the film in the bigger picture and an essential cog in the wheel for the saving of man's soul.From a technical standpoint, I don't think this is a perfect film. I think there are a few moments and scenes that are executed a bit too clumsily due to Scorsese's overindulgence with the jump cut to a rapid tracking shot. He perfected this technique later on with 'Goodfellas', but here those moments seem a little unpolished. Having said that I think the crucifixion is brilliantly handled both visually and tonally. The acting is brilliant from everyone concerned. Barbara Hershey and Harvey Keitel bring gravitas to the roles of Mary Magdalene respectively. Willem Dafoe as Jesus brilliantly embodies the kind of Jesus that this particular interpretation wants him to be. Instead of the all-knowing, charming, overly kind godly Jesus that we get in many other interpretations, here Dafoe gives off a sense of uncertainty, a sense of fragility, a sense of humanity that works perfectly for the film.In a nutshell, I think the purpose of 'The Last Temptation of Christ', the film and the book blasphemous as it could be, is to ground the mystique of Christ and show him as a flawed human being with similar fears, concerns and vulnerabilities like us. But at the same time in showing him eventually overcoming these doubts and weaknesses, the film ends up being a unique portrayal of Jesus which is both accessible as well as inspirational even to a non-Christian, non-religious film- buff like me. Technically it is a bit clumsy at times because of some of the visual choices, but Scorsese and Schrader's treatment of the themes, the overall message and the brilliant performances make it easy for me to recommend 'The Last Temptation of Christ' wholeheartedly.",The Last Temptation of Christ
61,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,A fitting reflection of Christianity,5,6 April 2021,"The Last Temptation of Christ perfectly reflects the way I've felt about Christianity for my entire life: it makes no sense.On Willem Dafoe's lead performance, I can't imagine there's anyone in the world who could do a more entertaining portrayal of Jesus, but it's not enough to save this drawn out journey into the ancient heart of nonsense. It is by far the strongest suit of the movie. With Dafoe, even the emptiest, most incomprehensible sequences can at least become tolerable through his mere expressions and deliveries.There are certainly some segments of impressive visual feats, some truly haunting music cues by composer Peter Gabriel, and a tastefully chosen cast. It was fun seeing certain people in small roles, like John Lurie and David Bowie. Also, Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene has extremely sexy hands... they're tattooed and she has a pretty good manicure. I was like ""WTF - her hands are so hot""...The film is extremely ambitious and that I admire, but it's themes are so far out I cannot find resonance in them in either a metaphorical or realistic way. It's simply nonsensical, therefore, it's hard to feel anything other than...amused, for brief moments at a time. Perhaps if the movie were about anything other than Christianity, there could be...something worth more in it?I'm glad I watched it, especially for Dafoe's performance, but honestly it's one of the only two Scorsese movies I've seen that I don't like overall. I disliked Shutter Island much more, but this comes in at #2 at the bottom for me.There's one line of dialogue that I really loved, which is directed at Jesus in the movie. I didn't ask for this, but it pretty clearly seems like it can be perfectly flipped to use as a statement regarding this film:""See, this is what happens when a man doesn't get married. The semen backs up into his brain""",The Last Temptation of Christ
62,David-240,Scorsese + Religion = Boredom,2,26 July 1999,"Scorsese has only made two bad films that I have seen: this one and ""Kundun"".  Both are religious pictures and both take themselves so seriously that they become dull and unbelievable.  Maybe the lives of Christ and the Dalai Llama were not exactly barrels of laughs, but they can't have been all grim.And this film is silly to boot.  Harvey Keitel as Judas!  David Bowie as Pilate!  Talking snakes and talking lions!  The propagation of the idea that there is only ""one woman"" and her function is to have sex with men and have babies!  The disciples are from New York but Satan is English!  Lazarus was mouldy!The film makes an attempt to be realistic with silly details like that last one, and it tends to wallow in its violence.  Sometimes it seems like a gangster flick in Gallilee!  For a more realistic picture of the era see ""The Life of Brian"".And why is this film so long!  It makes most of its points in the last hour, so why not cut the rest.  I liked the Peter Gabriel music though and Willem Dafoe made a valiant attempt to make sense of Christ, and the picture, like ""Kundun"", looked great.  But does religion really need to be so ""reverent""!?",The Last Temptation of Christ
63,OttoVonB,Mandatory Viewing,10,29 January 2005,"Films about Jesus tend, for all their possible individual cinematic strengths or weaknesses, to preach to the converted. It is mostly a given that in a film about Jesus the ""truths"" of Christian faith must be accepted before you can appreciate what happens on the screen. ""Passion of the Christ"" is the ultimate example: an act of faith more than an entertaining or thoughtful piece of cinema. ""Last Temptation of Christ"" is very different. The similarity between both films ends at the controversy preceding their release.The film shows us a tortured and uncertain man, Jesus, prone to visions and hallucinations, a carpenter who lives a hard life in Nazareth (he builds crosses and sees ""messihas"" die frequently, and his childhood friend Mary Magdaleine is a prostitute). Already this smells more of artistic license than gospel quotes, but it also rings truer and more brutally in keeping with the time than what is briefly summed up in the Good Book. The tense struggle between Israelite terrorists (including Judas) and Roman conquerors provides a violent background for this harsh environment. Out of this, Jesus comes to interpret his voices as the call of God and is ushered on by Judas, who sees in him not the son of God but a future independent leader for Israel. The misunderstanding between the two men is a wonderful contrast to their bizarre but strong friendship. As he gathers followers and takes on the role of Messia, he finally confronts roman power and, of his own will, is betrayed and crucified. On the cross, before finally giving himself completely to his cause, he reflects upon what a normal life might have been like...Never has an embodiment of Jesus been so human or a film about him being so deliciously ambiguous. The wonder is that if you approach it with a slightly open mind,you will find it solid and appealing to your views: as a Christian, it can give a new dimension to The Son of God, hence greater weight to his sacrifice. If you aren't a believer, it is a good portrayal of a gentle but weak mind sinking slowly into insanity, but through his conviction inspiring others. As a film, there are many reasons why this should be recommended viewing despite some flaws (Brooklyn accents and a blond Jesus): Willem Dafoe and Harvey Keitel are an excellent screen duo and embody their respective characters with conviction and sincerity, instead of being completely subdued by the role and religious reverence (as is the case in most Jesus films, especially ""Passion""), an unexpectedly good performance is given by a multi-layered Pilate, played by David Bowie. The direction is concise, tasteful and elegant without being intrusive and Scorsese handles the more delicate scenes (the miracles) with a certain subtlety absent from most films on the same subject. The oft-mentioned score by Peter Gabriel is perfect. Paul Schrader's screenplay probably deserves slightly more credit than any else's contribution, for keeping a fair balance between the legendary and the more rational and historical aspects of the story. All in all, this film should not be dismissed as wildly indulgent to either side in the eternal believer/atheist debate, but thoughtfully approached by all. Because in the end, what matters is its qualities as a movie, and they are, to say the least, significant!",The Last Temptation of Christ
64,flicklover,A very deep film about faith,10,10 March 2020,"When this film came out in 1988 it created quite a stir. Martin Scorsese directing a film about Jesus Christ? From a book that has been called blasphemous for its potrail of Jesus as a man with much insecurity and doubt. When I went to see it I was 19 years old and was very curious to see it. I was passionate about film at that time and Martin Scorsese was a great director. It couldn't be what the haters were saying right? There were protesters outside the theater trying to convince people not to see the film. Funny thing is the controversy helped the film do better box office. People trying to get people not see a film give it more notoriety than it probably wouldn't have had without the protests. In 2004, the controversy surrounding Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ made the film a must see. That film grossed alot more than it would have without the controversy just the same. That film was Mel Gibson's very literal interpretation of the day leading up to the crucifixion of Jesus. People freaked out at the level of graphic violence Gibson showed in his potrail of the torture and crucifixion,among accusations of anti semitism.The Last Tempation of Christ begins with a message saying that the film is not based on the Gospels but on the book written by Nikos Kazantzakis. The whole controversy was about the films depiction of Jesus as wanting and dreaming of being just a man. The film goes though alot of the events known from the New Testament. I have seen the film many times since and don't understand why it was so controversial? I have always been it as a film about faith. Any faith, not just Christianity. I have read that Martin Scorsese was going to be a priest when he was young and don't think the film is anti Christian in any way. I think Scorsese is very much a believer in the sacrifice of Jesus. I think it is a film about faith, not religion. To me they are not the same thing.Grade: A-",The Last Temptation of Christ
65,macpherr,"This is a must see movie, for Christians, it will make you think and deepen your faith!",8,13 December 1999,"The movie is a patchwork of the parables, the miracles, and the life and crucifixion of Christ.  I completely agree with Leonard Maltin's that  ""this movie is thought-provoking deep felt drama.""  Indeed! It will make you think! For starters the ability to think was given by God himself, and that includes the ability  to raise issues and metaphors. The movie quotes scriptures, literally.  From the beginning to end Nikos Kazantzakis quotes straight from the Bible when he is not talking in metaphors. I watched, Willem Dafoe,  on ""Inside the Actors Studio"" and because of him I decided to write this comment. There is honesty and sincerity in how he feels about this movie. There is absolutely nothing offensive about the plot, or what is depicted in the movie.Perhaps some people are not comfortable with the dream scene of Jesus having sex with his wife, which is the case at hand.  What the movie is saying is: let's take this to a deeper level, (1) if Jesus had chosen (freedom of choice was given by God himself to men) to marry Mary Magdalene and have a normal person married life, we would not have the chance to be His followers because his death and resurrection were needed for his mission to be accomplished; (2) that he was tempted at every level that we are and yet he did not fall into temptation {He was tempted every day he lived, even to come off the cross, not just during those 40 days in the desert}; (3) the movie just raises important issues about freedom of choice. It did not affect my faith.  It is laughable to think that ""The Last Temptation"" would threaten anyone's faith. The only thing the movie did was to make me think that  Scorsese is indeed a brilliant man who has faith,  but thinks,  and raised good issues.  Faith is not affected by this movie at all.People that who are against this movie perhaps have not read the Bible because the Bible is a thought provoking book, it does not answer all questions that we might have,  it raises a lot of questions. That is for sure! In case you ask how do I know I have read it about seven times and read the New Testament about fourteen times. There are people falling in temptation left and right, from Genesis to Revelation.If you like to think and leave judgment for the judges and the judgmental, this is the movie will make you think. I like that! If you do, this is a must see!  With all that said ""not thinking"" will never be a substitute for GRACE! Faith, Grace and Love is what Christian faith is about.",The Last Temptation of Christ
66,bwaynef,Too tempting to resist,3,4 April 1999,"Ten years before Bill and Monica took over the headlines, those seeking show-biz scandals had to content themselves with the storm brewing over Martin Scorsese's film of Nikos Kazantzakis' book, ""The Last Temptation of Christ.""  Purely fictional, the film's depiction of Jesus as a self-doubting and none too godly Savior who builds crosses for crucifixions created controversy, not surprising in a decade dominated by escapist entertainment like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""  Give Scorsese credit for daring to make a film whose subject guaranteed a quick death at theaters in such a lightweight era. Give Universal even more credit for exploiting the controversy for all it was worth by rushing the film into theaters weeks earlier than planned and contentedly counting bigger grosses than the film would have generated had the Reverand Donald Wildman and other media savvy evangelical types not made such a fuss.  At the time, I, for one, had even suspected Universal of having a few Bible thumpers on its payroll.  After all, the complaints, or, to put it more accurately, the condemnations, pushed the film into the spotlight where it was heatedly discussed on ABC News Nightline, and even The Oprah Winfrey Show.  Though it didn't break any box-office records, it certainly performed beyond earlier expectations.So, did Scorsese's film merit such controversy?  It probably depends on how devoutly religious one is, as well as how open minded.  I'm not too religious, but my mind is open wide enough to accommodate just about anything except, perhaps, murder and child molestation.  Scorsese's film is a real mixed bag.  Fascinating at times, beautiful at others, and occasionally ridiculous.  Except for Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene, most of the lead roles are miscast.  Harvey Keitel is a Judas right off the streets of New York, and Willem Defoe as Jesus demonstrates why stardom eluded him even after ""Platoon"" and ""Mississippi Burning.""  He's intense, but not always when it's appropriate.  He's the Christ as he would have been played by James Dean.  In smaller roles, Harry Dean Stanton as Saul/Paul, and David Bowie as Pontius Pilate never erase their established images which make them curiosities in a Biblical setting.  Oh yes, and then there's the story:  if it doesn't offend, it may inspire a few chuckles.  Jesus struggles against his divinity and as he hangs dying on the cross, is lured down by a golden-haired female angel, and lives to a ripe old age with a wife and family.  It is Judas who informs him, none too diplomatically, of his mistake, exposing the angel as Satan and chastising Jesus for not having lived up to his part of the deal.  ""Betray me, you said,"" Judas brays, ""so I can save the world, but you didn't do your part.""  Realizing that he has, indeed, blown it, Jesus begs God for another chance and the film concludes with the Messiah, wearing a crown of thorns resembling a hairnet, back on the cross with a smile on his face.If the screenplay by Paul Schrader and the performances make ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" look like a busted pilot for a truly bizarre sitcom, then the cinematography by Michael Ballhaus and the production design by John Beard, as well as Peter Gabriel's haunting score, make it worthwhile, though not enough to justify a running time of 2 hours and 43 minutes. Whatever your religious stance, this film merits a look, although it might be a bewildered one.",The Last Temptation of Christ
67,eskimosound,Lol...!,10,23 November 2020,Well it's a superb movie. It reminds me of The Life of Brian! It's seems Jesus was Schizophrenic and all the people around him and indeed who were alive at the time were all nutters. It made me laugh out loud in places (Hang on whilst I just stick this ear back on!). It certainly isn't some Biblical epic nor is it insulting to Christianity. It's probably a much more honest depiction of a man struggling with his life in the early days of Christianity. Beautifully shot and definitely worth watching. Look out for a great performance by David Bowie...,The Last Temptation of Christ
68,cinephile-27690,This Made Me Appreciate Jesus's Death More Than The Passion Of The Christ Did-Here's Why!,10,19 October 2019,"*This is not just a review, it's a deep explanation on why this is my favorite movie of all time. It's an edited version of my old review.*I became a Martin Scorsese fan a long time ago after I saw Casino when I was 16 and afterwards I wanted to see other movies that he made. I went on IMDB, went to 1988 and found ""The Last Temptation of Christ."" I was amazed. The same guy who directed a violent, profane movie about greed made a movie about Jesus?Then I read that it was not biblical. That turned me off. Often, Biblically inaccurate movies are not that good and turn out confusing, frustrating, or even boring.But I did some research on the movie anyways. On You Tube, I found a 13 minute interview with Martin Scorsese which stated why he made it. He noticed from his Catholic upbringing that Jesus was God AND He was a man. He was a human-like us! Since that is the case, what is it that makes Him human like us?That is the point of this movie. It's not biblical, but rather a thought provoking portrayal of Jesus' struggle with being human and His destiny to suffer and die by crucifixion.I also saw that Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel both adored it. Roger gave it 4/4 stars and in 2008 he wrote a review for his ""Great Movies"" series of reviews. And despite giving it 3.5 stars, Gene called it the best movie of the year!Additionally, I discovered that the un biblical nature of the movie gained controversy upon release. There were protests, death threats to Martin Scorsese, attacked film goers, etc. over the movie. And most of the protesters did not even see it!Then I decided it was time to check out this movie for myself. My 18th birthday was coming up, so I asked a friend who was once my babysitter to get it for me. I got it a month early. You will not be able to imagine how excited I was! I watched it that night to check it out.A part of me wants to analyze the movie scene by scene. But you probably don't want to read a review that long.Therefore I will discuss 2 main inaccuracies that made an uproar over 3 decades ago:2 Corinthians 5:21 says of Jesus: ""He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."" So Jesus was sinless. Got it.There is a scene in which Jesus talks with someone on a hill and he says that He sins. This ticked off many people-and it was even debated on Oprah. But the scene does not end here.""We all sin."" The person responds. ""Well, not my sins."" Jesus continues.Look at my verse quote again. Jesus knew no sin, but took our sins upon Himself. That's what He is saying-at least that's how I look at it.The biggest controversy involves Christ on the cross, and an angel comes and tells Him that God wants Him to live a normal life-and not die for mankind. Jesus has struggled with this fate for the whole movie, and is relieved to hear this. He comes down, marries Mary Magdalene, and has kids with her. This includes a half-minute scene in which they have sex. This angered the protesters the most.However, the movie is a work of fiction-and so this is not meant to be taken seriously.Later, He grows old and learns that His ""angel"" is actually Satan-who has deceived Him so He would not achieve victory over death. He asks God for another chance to die on the cross-and He gets it.He goes back on the cross and-relieved that He has achieved God's will, smiles and screams: ""It is accomplished!"" This is followed by joyous music that I have to dance to every time! :)As a result, the movie ended up making me appreciate Jesus's sacrifice more than any other moment in my life! I was very uplifted by the movie for the next few days, and I still have an emotional attachment now-after seeing it 7 or 8 times in 3 years! I even shared that with my senior year English class when I had to discuss my favorite movie for a minute as a class assignment!There is so much more that I could say about The Last Temptation of Christ, but this gives you a general idea on why I cherish this movie so much! I apologize that this review is so long(this may be the longest review that I ever write) but this is to give you a general idea on how spiritual, and not blasphemous, it is.The movie was based on a novel by an agnostic. In the prologue, he writes, in paraphrase: ""I hope this story will let any free man more than before, and better than before, love Christ."" And that is where The Last Temptation of Christ undeniably succeeds!4/14/20 Edit: I re-watched the movie on the day before Easter, among a few other Biblical movies that weekend. While it still makes my top 10, I consider The Prince of Egypt to be my favorite movie now.",The Last Temptation of Christ
69,dallasryan,Part One of Life,10,14 March 2012,"This movie proves if you have a good script, good directing and good acting, you can have an amazing movie. You don't always need to be precise with the costumes and sets in that period of time, which actually would have taken away from this story, the story of Jesus(in this film). This film basically delineates the key events of Jesus Christ, as the bible has it, but it adds things that may or may not have happened during Jesus' time. Most of this film is Jesus' doubt within himself and how he is God in his heart-on the inside, and how he is human-on the outside.In this movie,Jesus talks about how he must die on the cross in order to bring man and God together, to bring man into salvation. In the bible, Jesus was tempted, and he did throw things when he saw how the people were desecrating his father's temple, that part of the movie is true, according to the bible. But 'What is Truth' as Pontius Pilate said, a quote I've referred to many times. Each persons truth and/or opinion is different. What is the right way, who got it right? Christianity? Buddhism? L. Ron Hubbard? It just comes down to 'What is truth?' to the individual. If you live a happy life being a Christian, then that's right for you, if you live a happy life being a Scientologist, Buddhist, a Hindu, then that's right for you. There's always going to be arguments until our end of days about Everything and Anything. Eckart Tolle once talked about how most people that argue(one person arguing with another person), most of the time both people are correct in some way. He said we as humans hate to come to terms with that(that the other guy is correct too) and I agree with him on that. We as humans want everything to be right or wrong, black or white and if both people are right in an argument, then that's a real mind freak to us, we like it to be one way right, or one way wrong, but that's really never the case. And the other mind trip is that if one person is very ignorant and the other person isn't and/or they're well educated in what they are arguing about, still most of the time, both persons will be correct in an argument. Of course there's levels of what is sensible and what isn't, but in the end, both people are usually right in some way unless it's something to the likes of a story Eckart Tolle once told, he said, 'If I had an apple in my hand, I would know it to be an apple. If the Buddha came up to me and told me that it wasn't an apple, I would say 'Well I guess even the Buddha gets it wrong sometimes', I would know it to be an apple.' In those kinds of scenarios yes, someone is right and someone is insensibly wrong.So the same applies with this movie, there's no black or white, it's all gray. Jesus is tempted, a lot more here then he is in the bible. In this film he knew Mary Magdalene as a child, then he grows up, and goes into her Place and watches her have sex with men all day. Jesus loves Mary and he has to suffer watching her with all these men, and then not give into the temptation of sleeping with her. Extreme suffering already. Here Jesus doesn't want to die on the cross, he asks his father, himself in so many terms 'is there another way?' Jesus gets tempted by Satan to the very end with a 'It's a Wonderful Life Sequence' that is brilliantly thrown into the mix of this movie. Judas doesn't want to betray Jesus in this movie, but Jesus asks him too, so Judas does because he loves Jesus so much. Willem Dafoe as Jesus Christ? From what we know of Jesus, from the bible, from that time period, from stereotypes, Willem Dafoe is very miscast as Jesus, initially, just like initially you see Harvey Keitel as Judas, and think the same thing, but once you get over that initial stereotype, you see Dafoe as Jesus because he is so good at bringing the part to life. Excellent performances by Dafoe and Keitel. Again, it's all about the struggle from within, and the things that tempt us. Everything tempts us, uncertainty is what we always feel in life, just like the uncertainty Jesus felt in this film. In this film, Jesus' God self inside is constantly butting heads with his human self on the outside, bringing about so much confusion and uncertainty within himself, The Last Temptation of Christ is more a conflict of Person Vs. Person, or should I say Jesus Vs. Jesus. But Jesus knew himself by the end of this film. It was a struggle, and it was a powerful journey. Experience it for yourself, watch this film!",The Last Temptation of Christ
70,coconutkungfu-30704,One Of Scorsese's Best.,9,15 February 2020,"This movie represent how something with religious themes and subject matter can be done right. The performance by Willem Defoe is absolutely excellent, the cinematography is beautiful and the music is very atmospheric
.
The film manages to tell a fascinating version of a biblical story by not being a dull retelling of gospels ,but is instead a engaging way to tell the stories contained in these gospels in a unique way.The film will probably be controversial for some people (Most likely very devout Christians) But the fact that this diverts from scripture is the reason why (Alongside it being an excellently made film in all ways possible), this is a much better film than something awful like passion Of The Christ.POTC which was awful in its portrayal of Jewish people, very strictly bound to biblical text and focused overtly on the titular suffering, is a film that was alienating IMHO.
POTC was seemingly made for devout Catholics that wanted to see what they believe on screen, whilst Last Temptation of Christ however, is a film that is worth seeing no matter if you are atheist, agnostic or a believer in any sort of religion due to it being well-made and interesting.This film is highly recommended.9 out of 10!",The Last Temptation of Christ
71,Aly200,Terrific Filmmaking and One of Scorsese's Underrated Masterpieces,8,29 January 2017,"The 1980s seemed to be a hit or miss period for legendary director Martin Scorsese. His biopic ""Raging Bull"" scored Oscar gold while quirky comedy ""After Hours"" received mixed reviews and under-performed at the box office (now it is a cult classic from the director's catalog). However the legendary director found himself in hot water when he decided to tackle the controversial religious novel ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" by Nikos Kazantzakis. Many considered the film to be blasphemous to Christian beliefs and was labeled offensive by various religious groups and some critics. Over the last 30 years, the scope of the movie has been reassessed and opinions have changed to see the film in a more creative light.The film follows the trials and tribulations of Jesus Christ as he is portrayed as more human than the divine figure most faiths are familiar with. Jesus is faced with human temptations like self-doubt and lust (which was what incited much of the film's controversy) in his path to eventually become the Messiah. The narrative does include Biblical elements from the New Testament once Christ begins to follow his divine destiny, but it is not a strictly Biblical tale; more of an interpretation based on some theological theories that Jesus was only human (the debate continues especially with works like Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"").Playing the important title role of Christ is the always reliable Willem Dafoe in what should have been an Oscar nominated performance. While the role was originally offered to Scorsese's go-to muse of the time, Robert De Niro, the filmmakers ultimately picked the most unlikely yet in the end, ideal, casting choice. Willem Dafoe himself has stated over the years he is still shocked he pulled off such a role in playing the Messiah, but if one watches the film it is an acting masterclass. Dafoe brings a convincing vulnerability to Jesus, making the character seem believably human even when he starts to become more sure of his path to being the prodigal Son of God. The quality only increases as Dafoe deftly handles the internal struggle to either simply be an average man or become the divine Messiah; the revealing moment is perfectly represented when Jesus faces his desert isolation and is confronted by his inner temptations. When Jesus finally accepts his status as the Son of God, Dafoe himself almost has a God-like divinity as he embraces his destiny but maintains his crisis of faith until the film's fiery climax where Christ must make the ultimate choice for the fate of the world: continue living an illusion or renounce his errors and accept the gruesome fate he is meant to endure.Providing an equally bravado performance is underrated actress Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene (mostly referred by her surname in the movie). Her characterization is based on the divisive theory that Mary was a prostitute as depicted in the film (which has since been dis-proved by respected historians); a flawed woman who wishes for Jesus to abandon his divine path and be with her. The actress owns her scenes as she spouts venom at co-star Willem Dafoe, unleashing all her anger while masking a hidden sadness. Hershey, like her co-star, should have received an Oscar nomination for the depth she brings to Magdalene. She never becomes a stereotype nor does she allow herself to fade in the background, but maintains a presence even when not physically on-screen (Mary is portrayed as a black snake in a visual metaphor when Jesus experiences his temptations during visions). A special mention should be made for the cameo appearance of the late David Bowie as Pontious Pilate. The British musician holds his own on-screen with Willem Dafoe's Jesus (who remains mostly silent during the scene). Bowie is calm and commanding as he delivers his dialogue with authority while remaining stoic in body language and in his vocal delivery. The part of Pilate was out of character for the quirky singer, but in true Bowie fashion the singer stands out even when delivering his lines to the film's star. Even Bowie's final parting words echo and resonate, leaving an indelible mark on the narrative.The movie's only black spot in acting is the Razzie nominated performance of frequent Scorsese collaborator, Harvey Kietel as Judas Iscariot. Normally Kietel brings his A-game to his roles and knocks the part out of the park, but taking the pivotal role of Jesus's treacherous disciple seemed to be a misstep in the actor's prestigious resume. While numerous other actors maintain their natural accents, Kietel's native New York accent becomes overtly distracting especially as the actor over-exaggerates his lines. Not the most awful performance of Kietel's career, his acting pales in comparison to the compelling and far superior performance of Willem Dafoe as both actors share numerous scenes together. If you choose to disagree with me about my opinion, go right ahead as this is only my opinion (though shared by critics of the time and some audiences).Under Scorsese's directorial eye, the narrative never ceases to provide insight into its subject though the pacing does slow at times. The cinematography is breathtaking (filmed on location throughout Jordan in the Middle East) with its vast landscapes and eye-catching visuals for its symbolism. The screenplay is taut as it is adapted by Scorsese's regular screenwriter (later turned director) Paul Schrader. Schrader keeps the source material intact even as he intertwines iconic Biblical moments including the wedding where Jesus turned water into wine, the cleansing of the temple after Palm Sunday to the ultimate crucifixion of Christ at the film's conclusion. Go into the film with an open mind which can help you appreciate the mastery behind the religious undertones.",The Last Temptation of Christ
72,karl_consiglio,I love Jesus,8,3 September 2006,"In this movie Jesus is portrayed as a human being, no stronger than you and I, but as one who listened and trusted in his gut feelings, his heart, enough to look and sound like a downright madman when he spoke, especially if before he was known to be no more than the son of a carpenter. I wondered and imagined what would the reaction be had I decided to do something of the sort today, just like that, one fine day, out of the blue in public. There would be nothing more courageous. But then again would it be vanity, narcissistic? An entire battle between heart and mind, demons and angels. Believe me I make my research, watching this movie again with no distractions was part of it.",The Last Temptation of Christ

Petty and so very full of himself. Anyway, Dafoe does a seriously good job with the part of Jesus and getting to see Harry Dean Stanton preach is worth the price of admission. I don't understand why the film is supposed to be so controversial but then I don't travel in those circles.

74,a.lampert,Boring pretentious religious epic,1,14 March 2016,"I felt I wanted to comment on this film to warn viewers that this really is the most boring pretentious rubbish I've seen for a long time. At nearly three hours long there is nothing here to recommend it other the main reason I watched it, and that was to see Barbara Hershey when she was at the top of her game. And she's not in it for long. Like most of us at school in England in the 1950's as I was, we were all taught these familiar stories about Jesus, healing the sick, turning the water into wine, raising the dead, dying on the cross and being resurrected etc etc. so I'm very aware of the background, unfortunately I couldn't really make much sense of the narrative here as it's tried to be way too clever for it's own good as cinema. I understand it follows the book which I haven't, and clearly will never read. However, if you are going to make a film about Christ, and it's still a good story, regardless of whether or not you believe all that stuff, which I do not, it doesn't necessarily mean you cannot enjoy a well made film as I did with Mel Gibson's terrific 'Passion of The Christ'. Unfortunately here, we have a skin white Jesus, played by Willem Dafoe as if he's about to fall asleep most of the time, wandering around muttering mumbo jumbo and being browbeaten by a much tougher Judas, played with gusto by Harvey Keitel as if he's just stepped out of one of his Scorsese gangster movies and can't quite make the adjustment. There are long, long scenes when absolutely nothing much happens and for the first half I kept thinking, well, David Bowie as Pontius Pilot is listed as one of the stars so that might be interesting. Well, he appears for about three minutes and wanders off and that's it. I think he must have gone for a cup of tea and decided not to come back. If I can nominate an actor for being top bore in an epic film, then Willem Dafoe wins my vote. Needless to say, Barbara Hershey was wonderful, but that's the only reason for staying on this trip.",The Last Temptation of Christ

76,Kakueke,Jesus is Just Alright,3,6 December 2001,"Although an original idea is at work here, the screenplay and the depiction of Jesus do not work.  The problem is not so much that the movie focuses too much on Jesus as a man rather than God.  The problem is that the portrayal of Jesus as a man simply falls short.In movies, an historical figure is hardly ever given less-heroic stature than he or she actually had.  In this film, Jesus as a man is not dynamic or heroic, he is a wishy-washy loser.  Have him fearful of a violent end to his life, sure.  But aren't soldiers able to carry this without displaying it all the time?  No reasonable interpretation of the New Testament would have Jesus not showing any joy after a miracle, but instead displaying a painful countenance.  Why not have the torments inward, psychological, and perhaps displayed outwardly but subtly?Clearly, Willem Dafoe was coached to be, well, an average man.  Jesus, however, was not average. Moreover, the aura about Jesus in this film is more of cheapness than commonness.  This is played out, for example, in the adultery/sex sequences, which are subtly sensational, if you can accept that apparent oxymoron.Other examples can be given,  Thus, the ""triumph"" that is accomplished is bogus.

What am I!?,3,2 February 2015,"Well, kiddies - I seriously warn you, don't expect this grossly flawed, absurd and laughably pretentious tale about the ultimate ""lost boy"", Jesus Christ, to fit in with your starry-eyed ideas of religious revelation.Containing just about every religious cliché in the book (and then some), our ""fictionalized"" story opens with Christ as an aimless, young, Jewish man whose means of employment is (get this!) building wooden crosses for the Romans so that they, in turn, can nail up his fellow countrymen in occupied Judea. (Can you believe it!!??) In my opinion, actor Willem Dafoe certainly made for being an ultimately terrible Jesus Christ character. He really did.Not only did Dafoe totally lack a commanding screen-presence, but, his uninspiring ""Christ"" depiction convinced me that Jesus was nothing but a babbling, clueless schizophrenic who actually had conversations with burning bushes and blindly believed that ""God"" worked in mysterious ways.Unfortunately, this film's high-handed, little story inevitably deteriorated into a dumb ""ancient time"" soap opera where Christ regularly screwed his wife (who was an ex-whore), went on family picnics with his kids, and tragically transformed into one of the biggest couch-potatoes that biblical times has ever seen.My recommendation - Save yourself 2 hours & 40 minutes of blasphemous grief and watch something else instead.",The Last Temptation of Christ

79,Fever,have an open mind and watch it,9,13 August 1998,"I thought this movie was an excellent piece of film making. A fabulous score and stunning cinematography take us through the inner struggle of Jesus in accepting his role and his duty. It tells how he faced temptation, ridicule , torture and triumph. Before you burn my name in effigy for liking this movie, be open minded and just experience a good film. The ""disclaimer"" at the beginning of the movie says it all. It is not necessarily based on events in the Bible. Just as Jesus used parables as a way of teaching, this movie tells a story of a man's life and events that we can all somehow personally relate to. By the way, the portrayal of Satan was the best I've seen yet.",The Last Temptation of Christ
80,Derek237,It's a Wonderful Christ,10,23 May 2004,"Usually when a movie about Jesus wants to point out that he was just a human being they stress the pain factor- he feels pain like anyone else and is afraid to die, especially in such a horrifically painful way. The Last Temptation of Christ points that out too, but this Jesus isn't so much afraid of the pain as he is afraid of not ever living his life. That is where the last temptation takes place. In the last half hour or so of the movie, Jesus is guided by a guardian angel and shown what his life would be like if he hadn't have sacrificed himself. It turns out that life isn't all it's cracked up to be, and things end up terrible because he never died for peoples' sins. It's basically ""It's a Wonderful Life"" except instead of George Bailey never being born, it's Jesus Christ never being crucified.I really loved this movie, the way it was presented was amazing. It was so vivid and dreamlike; you feel very up close and personal with Jesus, especially since you can actually hear his thoughts. The acting is just great. Willem Dafoe fills Jesus' sandals quite nicely and provides a believable different angle of a Jesus who has fear, weakness, self-doubt, and seems to be making things up as he goes along. There are many complaints about Harvey Keitel's performance as Judas (most notably the thick New York accent) and many say it's the one thing that brings down the movie, but I thought he was great. He's definitely the most interesting apostle since he actually betrayed his leader- the movie suggests that Jesus was closest to him and he requested that Judas should betray him so he could fulfill his destiny on the cross. Hey, ya never know.This is typical Scorsese mastery. It's a thought-provoking, emotional film that will stick with you for a long time. Just try to remember it's only a movie and it's just offering a different point of view of Jesus Christ. And most likely a more accurate one, too.My rating: 10/10",The Last Temptation of Christ
81,irishboy141,The Tough/Beautiful life of Jesus,10,6 June 2019,"This is one of my favorite films ever and it is my favorite film about Christ. Everything from the sets, to the direction, to the actor's performances is spot on. This is the gold standard of what religious films should be.For anyone who doesn't know, this film is an alternate take on the life of Jesus (based on the book of the same name). Naturally it was embroiled in controversy and protested by people who hadn't seen it. There's an irony about supposedly ""strong faithed"" people being so insecure/shaken/offended about Jesus's representation in a movie.Anyhoo Jesus is played very well by Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel plays Judas wonderfully with great tenderness, Barbara Hershey is great as Mary Magdalene, quite simply all actors are on point and give an excellent human portrayal of their respective characters. I believe Judas and Jesus's relationship here is the best version ever portrayed, same with Jesus and Mary's relationship.As for the ending (which is what people were so pissed about) I find it very interesting, It's like a dream. It's literally his last temptation, which he overcomes. If anything it makes Jesus more BA/admirable, he beat the devil and his own mortal urges. He finally embraced being the son of God, he truly is worthy of being the Messiah.Martin Scorsese did a fantastic job and this film is rightfully hailed as one of the best films of all time, and especially one of the best religious films.Bravo.",The Last Temptation of Christ
82,Cocacolaguy912-2,"Unflinching, good Jesus tale.",8,16 August 2007,"Jesus in general is a very touchy subject. It is hard to make a film about Jesus, or for that matter, Religion, without offending someone. Not very religious myself, I was able to watch the film unbiased and with an open mind.I will say right off what I liked so much about this movie is that it shows Jesus as a flawed being. A saint in the end, but confused and belligerent about his purpose in life. Not a bad person. Just unhappy and bewildered by who he was.Now you may or may not agree with that but I stand by what I just said...but moving on.The film feels like it drags on at times, but in the end you realize everything that happened was necessary and the end was the whole point. I will admit at some points I just wanted it to end, but when it finally did get to the end, I am glad I stuck it out.The acting here isn't too bad but I wouldn't call it anything masterful. Willem Dafoe is quite good as Jesus, and several of the supporting actors are good as well...not fantastic, but good enough.On a final note, I will say it doesn't take someone deeply religious to appreciate, like, or understand this film. As I said before, I am not very religious...probably better to not be religious anyway sense their are some many things in this film that have the potentiality to upset such people...just be open minded.8/10",The Last Temptation of Christ
83,n-mo,No redemption for this one. No pun intended.,1,12 September 2008,"Most critiques of ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" turn around the premise that the film is blasphemous and pornographic. In fact it is; however, the controversy seems to me a bit superfluous, since on purely cinematic grounds, it is not a good movie, easily Martin Scorsese's worst. But I guess ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" necessarily attracted attention due to the brand name of its director.And Scorsese's brand of story interpretation is on full display here. For Scorsese, anything that does not push some sort of envelope of decency does not go far enough. Here's the thing, though: in a film that does not seek to denigrate Christianity or Catholicism, WHAT is the interest in showing Christ kiss men on the lips, getting stripped naked on the Cross and fantasizing about consummating a marriage with Mary Magdalene? The answer, of course, is provocation for the sake of provocation. When I was a schoolboy we usually categorized schoolchildren who did that sort of thing as bullies, and no one who had a hand in making or promoting (including by the writing of glowing reviews of) this film can credibly claim to be shocked by the reaction it aroused.But of course, provocation is only typically Scorsesean. And if it were the only cinematic flaw in this movie, it might not - apart from the religious aspect - have so severely dented the watchability of this movie. (""Casino,"" ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Departed"" were all highly enjoyable despite and at times even because of their excesses.) Alas...An introspective into the burden of a dual nature (Divine/human) on the human side of Christ might sound (to some) salaciously tempting in theory, but is a bit thornier to work out in practice. If one accepts the existence of a dual Divine/human nature as a reality (even within a fictional universe), one would at least expect the Divine nature would thwart the worst visceral reactions of the human nature. Yet Scorsese's insistence on showing raw emotion in its most direct form for provocative reasons seriously damage the credibility of Dafoe's Jesus. There were other, more subtle ways he could have emotional burdens that may not even require much alteration to a stoic facial expression. Again, though, Scorsese and subtlety are like oil and water, and so this sort of task is simply beyond him.Then there's the script. Of course it takes lots of liberties with the Gospel account - this is Hollywood we're talking about, of course. But the parts that ARE based on Gospel text are immediately obvious to anyone who has read the Gospel accounts, and the only attempt that is made to weave actual quotes from Christ into the rest of the fabric is the total destruction of their elegance and lyricism in favor of short, banal quips that would have made a Soviet Bloc propaganda copywriter moan in exasperation. (Imagine a Biblical translation that changed ""This is my Son, with Whom I am well-pleased"" to ""Atta-boy!"" and you start to get an idea of how flat-out *bad* this is.) I would trash the acting, as well, if not for the fact that no one could have made good out of this.Finally, there's the production values. The cinematography is amateur and, I daresay, wholly unworthy of Scorsese. The sets and costumes are bland and boring if you have any sense of period accuracy, and given what we saw over a decade and a half later in ""The Passion of the Christ,"" it's not too much to say that these already-inadequate props have aged quite badly.Overall, a bad film. It may be blasphemous to God, but it's also a travesty to the great art of cinema.",The Last Temptation of Christ

Is he already God, or man yet ?These questions hardly matter during a film passing through the mind in about half an hour, even though it actually lasted 2 hours 44 minutes before the eyes... The perfection of imperfection. We have seen Dafoe, Keitel and Hershey in brilliant roles before, but were they ever so wonderful ? As for the rest of the cast, Lurie, Stanton and Bowie and perhaps all others, the answer to that same question must be that they are at their peak here.The tandem Kazantzakis-Scorsese, or should we speak of a trident and include Schrader, is enigmatic and glorious.

87,Better_Sith_Than_Sorry,What Part of 'Fictional' Do You Not Understand?,9,8 September 2021,"This film begins with a preface telling the viewer that what is about to be shown is a fictional version of a well-known story; namely that of Jesus of Nazareth. Yet a perusal of the 1-star comments here reveals that certain reviewers are complaining that 'The Last Temptation of Christ' is un-scriptural or non-Biblical. Um, yeah, exactly. That's what the preface told you, buddy. It's not an attempt to re-tell the biblical story. It's an attempt at telling it from a new perspective, and admitting up front that it's fictional. ""Fictional.""
Meaning 'fake,' 'made-up,' or 'not to be taken as fact.' What part of 'fictional' do you not understand?So for any reviewer to rate TLTOC poorly, simply because it does not comport to the Gospels, is missing the point; and I wonder if they can even read English. This would be like if I gave you some chocolate ice cream and you said it tasted terrible because you wanted it to be vanilla. Well, I never said it was vanilla, you were told specifically it was NOT vanilla, and yet you're still going to complain that it tastes terrible because it's not vanilla? Then guess what? The problem lies with you, not the ice cream. Same goes for this film.Speaking of this film...tremendous stuff. What you get here is a very human Jesus of Nazareth. A Jesus who is unsure of himself, who he is, and what he's supposed to do with his life. When he finally begins preaching, he doesn't quite know what to say and is mocked by the crowd. Jesus has to learn on the job and find his way. When he attempts to perform miracles he doesn't know if he'll be successful. It's a vastly different view of Jesus than any you've likely seen.This is not to say it's a disrespectful telling. Far from it. In fact, the story ends in the exact same place most films on the topic do, as well as the Gospels. It's the 'getting there' that's different, and Scorsese deserves a lot of credit for having the courage to bring this alternate version to the screen. It's pretty long and felt liked it dragged a little at times, so for that I deducted a star. But the climax was so unexpected and so impressive that I was completely floored and suddenly didn't care about any minor gripes I might have had. Really, really well done.Roger and me: Roger Ebert gave this film 4/4 stars in his initial review and added it to his ""Great Movies"" list 20 years later. I'm right there with you, Roger.9/10. Taking one star off for length but otherwise, super-impressive effort by Scorsese and the cast. Dafoe was brilliant as a conflicted Jesus.

The fact that it is adequately boring, given the meaning of the content of the second half of the film, unfortunately doesn't make the movie any more enjoyable. Without spoiling the movie, this is as much as I can say, and yes, it's a movie that can be spoiled--it is quite good. Harvey Keitel plays the most badass Judas with a Brooklyn accent I have seen since DRACULA 2000, and Willem Dafoe is very memorable. For a minute, I thought Harry Dean Stanton (I looked his name up on imdb) was Dennis Hopper, and he plays an Apocalypse Now Dennis Hopperesque role too. Quite spiritual. And still worth watching just for the controversy and scandals it aroused, just to be one of those people who can say they've seen that movie.

I thought it was a very humanistic look at the life of Christ, but I suppose ""that"" is what the hard-core religious groups were all up in arms about. I don't want to get into a religious debate with anyone, but as a film I thought it was a very plausible explanation to ""the divine"" issue and how Christ ""might"" have dealt with what was happening to him as a human being and not as an ""all-knowing-walking-on-water"" god-like figure that I suppose people who ""do-not-believe"" have a hard time with. I think, my opinion only, it was dealt with in a very realistic way and handled with a lot of grace from Scorsese and also Willem Dafoe in a stellar performance.

90,canadude,Jesus loses his virginity to a prostitute in Scorsese's masterpiece,10,31 March 2004,"This retelling of Christ's life features Jesus begging Judas to betray him (only to be called a traitor in return), Jesus building crosses for the Romans to crucify fellow Jews, and British actors and voices *all* playing evil characters. Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ is, despite and because of these things, a brilliant film, one that approaches closest to Christianity's core obsessions and problems. It also serves as a perfect palette cleanser for those who had the distinct misfortune of watching Mel Gibson's processing of Jesus Christ through the Hollywood meat-grinder for (deeply disturbing personal reasons and) money.But Gibson's dementia aside. Martin Scorsese's film is profoundly quiet and thought-provoking. Is it blasphemous? Or rather, is the controversy it stirred justified? I'd say so. Paul Shrader, the writer of the film, himself admits that on a certain level the film is blasphemy. But not literally. It uses God as a conceit for man's condition and struggle to understand God. And this desire to comprehend which pervades the film renders its blasphemy a noble one. Or forgivable one. The film, after all, explores the relationship between the human and finite with the divine and infinite with a passion present in all aspects of it. The Last Temptation is about the struggle of those two, particularly in the face of destiny and death. In that sense, it is a very existential film. Dafoe's Jesus at first doubts he is even God's son. He doesn't know - he searches. He reaches false conclusions and true ones. The beauty of his struggle lies precisely in not always knowing the answers. He is, after all, human.And then again, he is not. However, on its own, this statement means very little. The film probes the relationship of the Jesus of Nazareth who sins like the rest of us, with Christ, the son of God who is sacrificed for our sins. It explores the nature and meaning of that sacrifice. The segment that I would imagine caused the greatest amount of controversy, namely (not surprisingly) Christ's last temptation, provides the bridge between Christ and pre-Christ, Jesus of Nazareth. It asks us to imagine Jesus being saved from death. And through this theoretical contemplation we see the necessity of the sacrifice, its binding nature. Judas, in fact, summarizes this perfectly by saying: ""The life of a man is not for you. Your place is on the cross"" (I am paraphrasing, but the point is there). Jesus' struggle, throughout the film, ends exactly at this point, at this realization which allows him to say on the cross ""It is accomplished."" The fact that this struggle is made real and accessible to us is what makes this a phenomenal film.The film's brilliance shines on pretty much all levels. Scorsese's direction is atmospheric, extremely compassionate and restrained (as opposed to the orgiastic explosion of [unnecessary?] violence in Gibson's film). The performances are great. Hershey's Mary Magdalene is amazing. Dafoe's Jesus and even more so Keitel's Judas are brilliant. In fact, Judas in this film is almost as much a central character as Jesus. In The Last Temptation Judas isn't the evil traitor who gets himself killed over a maggot-ridden corpse like in Gibson's tale, but a character so full of love he *agrees* to betray Christ. The act of betrayal here is one of coming to terms with fate very much on the same level as Jesus' acceptance of his self-sacrifice. Judas must betray Christ even though he has grown to love him.
There are many reasons to see this film. It is a deeply spiritual examination of Christ the man and Christ the Son of God and the transition from one to the other. In some way, it is a perfect portrait of a man's search for answers and for God - it is spiritual existentialism, uncannily similar to Kierkegaard. It is the exact opposite of The Passion of the Christ and it should be celebrated.",The Last Temptation of Christ
91,botrytis,The Struggle of being Human,10,10 March 2019,"What's probably the greatest achievement of this movie is the portayal of the real issues we have to deal with daily, and what's the best way of doing this as to choose the most misterous person we know from history/or religious books and show his human side. This is probably the only thing the Bible or the other thousand Jesus movies couldn't deal with, and why those things never worked that well. Because they didn't comprehend the real element which should be communicated to the audience.That Jesus was human too, so he had to deal with similar problems as we do; The Human Nature itself.The vessel of our inner selves is Jesus himself. The idea, the legend, myth, or historic person... doesn't really matter... what matters that it feels real, more than ever.Here, in this movie, the narrative is solved in a way that the whole story can be handled, or understood by our reality, by our undestandings of reality. There are no absolutes, there is no totally ""Saint Jesus who is the Son of God so he has magic powers""... there is no boring, and pointless realisations of all those parabolas, episodes written in those books to tell messages which we can't really connect with, because the person of interest acts unnatural, and alien-like.Here, we all could be in the place of Jesus. He acts crazy, he always hear voices in his head, from which he interprets messages differently throughout the movie. He fears, he is angry, he loves, he is human. He only understands the real meaning of happenings when he reached a certain point of achievement, accomplishment. When he things he did his mission, another message comes, or another interpretation. That's how we work. We never know what to do really until we do something about it. And when we do, we finally reach somekind of a realisation, to which based on we can move on the next level.Jesus worked in the same way to understand the fundation of human nature, and to what this corrupted way of living is based on. But he wouldn't achieve this mission without being a human, without confronting these human issues as everyone does, because immorality can be only healed by understanding immorality. This is the beautiful narrative through we could connect with all the message the Holy Bible and other Religions universaly teaches.The cinematography, the direction, and the music supports this whole realistic/down to earth story telling; it's dirty, but also cleansing, it's raw but also sofisticated, it's dry and rugged but also full of soul and softness. The Soundtrack of Peter Gabriel's is probably the most important music production ever put out in the human history; by simply listening to the whole album/tracks you can hear the universal spiritualistic nature of this monumental theme, cleansing your tired, agitated mind and spirit, making you more complete by which you can face your daily issues differently.I guess what I am trying to state here is that you can't understand religion, and the message sent by it without connecting to the human side of it, and that most missing part is being filled with this creation. And a story with such transcendent elements brought down to earth by humans to humans brings one of the most satisfying fulfilment to our lives of which we might have never expected to want, but the moment we experienced it we feel like we have always wanted it. This fulfillment... completeness... this... accomplishment.And that's what this movie is; One of the Greatest Accomplishment in the history of adaptation.",The Last Temptation of Christ
92,DrPhibes1964,A change of pace from Scorsese,10,23 December 2020,"When I saw this in 1988 I was a little disappointed that there was not a gang of protesters outside the theatre condemning the film and everyone who was going to see it. Since this was the matinee performance they were going to wait until the later shows. I will just go ahead and assume that none of them have actually seen the film.Without going on extended rant about my own views on religion and will only state simply that I do not share those of the film. I wasn't really there to see a film about Jesus, I was there as a fan of Martin Scorsese. Of the subject I was indifferent. I had seen a few religious films in the past and enjoyed them as entertainments but had no deeper impact.I was stunned by that first viewing of The Last Temptation of Christ. It presents a much complex and conflicted Jesus than we are used to seeing. The struggle between his human and divine sides is what made the character come alive and felt like a three dimensional person. The films I have seen previous about Jesus make him out as an otherworldly figure whom you couldn't connect with. Wilem DeFoe's Jesus seems like a person you sit with and have a long conversation with. The best moments are those between Jesus and Judas (Harvey Keitel). The relationship is more complicated than the simple story of the man who would go on to betray Jesus. It eventually reaches a moment when Jesus, having lived out his life as a mortal man (unknowingly been tempted down off the cross by the little girl who is in fact the devil) lays dying and is visited by his former apostles as Jerusalem is being laid to waste outside. Judas enters, hands bloodied from fighting, and then begins to berate Jesus for not fulfilling his part of the bargain that would unite humanity and heaven. Judas reveals reveals the little girl to be the devil and this has been a deception to keep Jesus from his mission. ""You broke my heart,"" Judas says. It is probably my favourite scene in the film. This Judas agonized about having to betray his friend and turn him over to the Romans and subsequently crucified.One aspect of the film which might evoke some laughter are the distinct New York accents of some of the actors. I don't find it overly distracting. The performances by all the actors are so compelling that this little glitch does not diminish the impact of the film in the slightest.I highly recommend reading the novel. Screenplay author Paul Schrader does an admirable job condensing a very dense book without losing the losing the spirit of the novel. I've read it three times now and find it a remarkable work. Like the film it offended some by making Jesus ""too human"" and were outraged that he married Mary, had sex with her, and became a father. In each medium it is treated with discretion and taste, but their deity must never succumb to such earthly flaws. This outrage never made much sense to me, especially after seeing the Mel Gibson film Passion of the Christ which so grotesque that I turned my eyes away from the screen several times. Watching a man being beaten for two hours was not my idea of an enlightening evening. Despite my own views on religion I found Last Temptation to have a more positive message and focused on his revolutionary words rather than those brutal few remaining hours of his life. I left the theatre following that initial viewing of Last Temptation with a head full of thoughts, whereas after Passion I felt sick and miserable that I got swept away by the hype surrounding the film.The soundtrack by Peter Gabriel is outstanding.This is a truly great film and can be seen by believers and nonbelievers alike.",The Last Temptation of Christ

No, I'm not a Christian - though I can't fathom why one has to be a fanatic Bible-thumper to hate this flick.For one thing, let's set aside the fact that Jesus Christ is portrayed as a whiny, meandering wimp while Judas Iscariot is portrayed as the only real man of the lot. That's the premise of the book, after all, and it's a valid artistic choice whether or not you can stomach it. (It's not that far off Jesus Christ Superstar, after all.)In any event, that isn't the key problem in casting Willem Dafoe as Jesus. The real plot hole is this: does his portrayal give you the impulse to follow this Nazarene bloke to the nearest bus stop, let alone suggest a charisma in him so strong as to engender a mass movement and a religion? Certainly not; Dafoe can be called many things as an actor, but his best friends are unlikely to include compelling charisma amongst his virtues.I'd say more, but that would confer this turkey too much importance in my life, and I'm only writing and voting on it out of a sense of cinematic duty.1/10.",The Last Temptation of Christ

And believe me, I've heard hundreds of versions of this story since childhood.  The problem was, most of the versions were thrust at me by evangelists and fundamentalists.  And it is now clear to me that THEY don't understand the true meaning of Christs' sacrifice.That's the point of this film.  It's not about the literal re-telling of the Biblical version of the crucifixion (which has been translated and re-translated so many times over 2000 years that no honestly rational person can accept it as totally accurate).  It is an attempt to get us to realise that what Jesus did for us was not easy.  It was hard.  Not just in terms of physical pain, but also in terms of mental and emotional anguish.  Folks, that's why it was a SACRIFICE!  If Jesus was not human, but totally God, then how could a few hours on a cross truly affect Him?  Where's the meaning of it all then?Seeing Willem Dafoe's characterization of Christ on the Cross brought tears to my eyes in a way that no fundamentalist church's passion play could ever hope to do.  I wish to thank Dafoe, Scorsese, Schrader, Peter Gabriel and all the rest for their gift to all of us.  And to those who consider this film (and me) blasphemous, so be it.

99,mukherjeesubham93,Scorsese's most boldest movie!,9,6 August 2018,"*Classic lookback*
THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRISTWe usually associate Martin Scorsese with his movies on organized crime. It's hard not to do that when he has made Goodfellas & Casino. But before that, in the late 80s, he was probably at his creative peak. In the decade which saw him making Raging Bull( Arguably his best movie), King of Comedy & After hours, the 1988 movie, The Last Temptation of Christ is my personal favorite of his entire filmography. It is Scorsese at his creative best and his boldest. 
Based on the very controversial novel of Nikos Kazantzakis of the same name which was itself banned in many countries, This movie was destined to be controversial. Which of course, it was. It frequently finds it's place in several 'most controversial films of all time' lists. The film was termed as blasphemous upon it's release and banned in many countries too. But if you care to watch it with an open mind, this movie is quite an enriching experience.
It's not an easy movie for a devout Christian believer. The movie's basic underlying theme is the conflict between Christ's worldly temptations as a mortal, and his divine duty of sacrificing himself for the sins of mankind. The movie doesn't follow the Bible. It humanizes Christ ( Played quite brilliantly by Willem Dafoe) he gets angry, he gets frightened, he asks his 'father' why is he the chosen one. As the movie progresses, Christ gradually starts to find answers to these questions. This process of self discovery of his purposes, not only seems very relatable but also helps us sympathize with the character. The Son of God, till that point of time had always been represented with an otherworldly aura. This was the first attempt to make him vulnerable and thus, more human....and quite naturally, it didn't go down well with all. 
Coming to the most controversial portions, the last one hour of the movie is it's most controversial portion and the take it or leave it point of the movie. As a open minded viewer, no doubt it was something very unique to witness. It's almost as if it takes us by the collar and coerces us with a very different point of view.
Controversy apart, it is a really well made movie. The cinematography, moody, dark, surreal at times works wonders. Peter Gabriel's musical score is one of the main highlights of the movie. And oh of course, i forgot to mention the representation of Satan! Very subtle yet chilling.
Despite saying so many points about the movie being controversial, i would never call it blasphemous. The movie ultimately never makes one question about one's faith in Christianity. It arrives at the same destination all other Christ movies have, but to reach that destination it takes an unexpectedly risky path. 
A very underrated film, in my opinion, The Last Temptation of Christ surely deserves a higher place in Scorsese's much coveted filmography. If possible, do watch this with an open mind. You'll never forget it in your lifetime.",The Last Temptation of Christ
100,easmith03,Dismal,1,6 November 2002,"This movie advertises itself as not being based on the gospels, and I had expected it to a fictionalized account of Jesus's life in events that weren't dealt with in the gospels, (which could have been interesting). However, this isn't the case. The movie covers the span of Jesus' life from just before his baptism, to his crucifixion. The movie deals with several well known events from the gospels, and kind of knits together a story that is partially from the gospels and partially not. Clearly the story is ""based"" on the gospels.The film plods along at a snails pace (you'll want to keep your finger on the fast forward button). Some have commented on the nice score in the film. I would recommend hitting the fast forward button when the music is playing. With about 30 minutes of interesting content packed into 2 1/2 hours, you aren't going to want to spend any more time watching this than you have to.A weak, and tormented Jesus unsure of seemingly everything he is doing, manages to work himself through the events of the new testament. *Yawn* I think I have seen that story told about a dozen different ways now, all of the others have been better than this one.",The Last Temptation of Christ
101,taikman,"Beautifully made, genuinely profound and Dafoe is superb.",9,20 February 2002,"When 'The Last Temptation of Christ' came out it was hugely controversial - director Martin Scorsese, whose dream it was to make this movie, was villified by many conservative Christians (most of whom never saw the film) for daring to make a movie where Christ is shown not as the holy and perfect son of God, but as a man who, like all of us, doubts, fears, lusts and rages. Except for one moment during the Sermon on the Mount, when he sounds like a salesman, Willem Dafoe gives one of the greatest performances of all time as Jesus. He is at times pitiful, inspiring, awesome and terrifiyingly intense, as his version of Jesus struggles to find the right way to achieve God's will. Dafoe is very well supported by Harvey Keitel as an unconventional Judas and Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene, and though there are a few lines that I think could have been better written, perhaps using more of the power of the Bible's language, and it slows down a little too much towards the end, it is a classic: beautifully shot with a superb Peter Gabriel soundtrack and an ending that is truly profound. It is at the end that you realise why the film is called 'The Last Temptation'.For Christians, I think this should almost be compulsory viewing. It does not try to erode the authority of Jesus (both Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader were Christians), but rather builds it up by making him seem more real, and thus more believable. I am and probably will remain an atheist, but I still found this one of the most moving films I've seen.",The Last Temptation of Christ
102,MubukuGrappa,The victory for this Movie lies in the fact that most people dislike it.,10,10 April 2006,"I begin with the reaction of a friend, whom I had asked to watch this movie. He/she wrote back to me telling that this movie was an absolute nonsense, and the imagination of a weird person. Accroding to this person, this movie was absolutely irrelevant and completely lost at lot of points.""I regret having asked him/her to watch this movie. I also think that most people disagree with this movie and dislike it for the same reason: they simply do not get it!! In my opinion, the victory of this movie lies in that very fact, because most people do not like to think,and if forced to think, they react aggressively.Even if all other movies (the so-called masterpieces, the gory Gangster movies) of Martin Scorsese cease to exist tomorrow, this movie alone will keep his name intact as one of the brilliant movie makers.I'm not an intellectual (actually far from it), and yet I could understand and appreciate this movie. Anyone, who is not a religious fanatic, and who has the slightest mental faculty (and love) to think, should watch this movie!",The Last Temptation of Christ
103,DaveDiggler,The Hope of Conquering Temptation,7,19 May 2008,"Martin Scorsese directs one of his finest achievements in a career of directing finest achievements. He takes on a subject close to his heart and close to his faith. Nikos Kazantzakis wrote an extraordinary piece of work on the life of Jesus of Nazareth. The last temptation takes place while Jesus is on the cross, but before that we watch Jesus (William Dafoe) try to overcome temptation as an everyday man. That's what Kazantzakis focuses on. While Christ is on the cross the pain and sacrifice wouldn't be the same if he didn't feel it and showing Jesus in the form of an everyday man may offend some devout Christians, but if they're offended then they're missing the point. God sent his son down to this earth to die for mans sins. That's what scriptures tell us, but Kazantzakis takes us down an intriguing road as the son of God battles the temptations of the everyday man, yet without sin. We watch Jesus struggle with acceptance that he is the messiah, but eventually he accepts his role. We watch Jesus tempted by evil, but he resists. When some hit's him, he turns the other cheek. He has love and he has love for everyone and everything. He doesn't have hate, he doesn't have sin, Jesus is a perfect creature in a man's body sent to do God's work. Martin Scorsese depicts him no differently than he's imagined or believed to have been.The final act is the greatest part of the film (maybe the most controversial). It shows Jesus taken down, off the cross, by his guardian angel- something that didn't happen according scriptures. As you watch this and if you know the story and haven't read the novel, you become baffled. You don't know what to think or how to interpret it. We see Jesus doing things he never did, like having sex, having children, and living out the rest of his life as an everyday man; living a good, humble life, old and tired. Only until the final moment and the final shot of the film, does the entire third act make complete sense, which makes the final statement by Jesus all that more powerful; ""It is accomplished!"" It isn't done in a negative manner. Kazantzakis and Scorsese aren't showing Jesus full of sin for no good reason. Showing the hallucination and showing Satan tempting Christ in his weakest moment is what makes Jesus' sacrifice even more powerful. Not only did he die for the sin of man, but he died for the sin of man while being tempted to live a normal and happy life as a man by Satan in the form of a beautiful guardian angel. There would be no torture; no death; no pain; no sacrifice, but here, Jesus fights his temptations and accepts his role and the path God sent him on. He dies on the cross in agony with temptation from Satan at his weakest moment. He's triumphant in a way that is hard to see triumph, but not only does he accept the sins of man, and not only does he sacrifice his life, but he defeats Satan and conquers temptation... as a man. Jesus is a powerful figure without sin and neither Scorsese nor Kazantzakis show him as anything less than the Lord and Savior. The film should leave you questioning your ability to resist temptation as Jesus did. As a devout Christian, one would think, you'd be more appreciative of the depiction in this film than any other film ever made on this subject. ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is a powerful film done without sensation, without hate, but with taste, respect, love and appreciation for his sacrifices and his ability to resist temptation and go on with the plan when, as a man, Jesus could have taken the easy way out. He didn't. He sacrificed his life and went through the pain and suffering as a man. Not as a God, where he knows there is no pain and he'll born again in three days, but as a man that can feel all the things we feel and resist all things we don't resist.Personally I have serious doubts about every word that I've come across, or every biblical story I've ever heard. I am not a Christian. I'm not atheist. I'm nothing more than a skeptic, but this film did something that I would never think possible; I had a religious experience and almost, for a second, became a believer. This is one of the most profound and powerful films ever made even though it has some serious flaws. You don't have to believe in God or Christianity to enjoy this film, simply an opened mind.",The Last Temptation of Christ
104,MovieRat-2,The truth must be heard,6,8 April 1999,"Let me make this perfectly clear to all those who hate people for slandering this movie, ""I DID SEE THE MOVIE!""  I will admit the movie was well made and the acting was very good; however, I must protest greatly the way Jesus is portrayed in this film. When I watched this film it was with a curious mind.  I heard that there are ""controversial"" things that are discussed in the film and I wanted to see what all the talk was about.  What I found was a nicely made movie but a slanderous story and ending.  Although the writer tries to redeem himself in the end by putting Jesus back on the cross to die for our sins is no good. Why you may ask?  Because at that point it was pointless to put Jesus back on the cross.  Jesus is supposed to be the ""spotless lamb"" to be sacrificed for our sins.  Once Jesus came off the cross he sinned. And then he kept sinning after sin after sin.  Some people may take this entire ""temptation"" sequence as a simple hallucination, but mind you, even in a hallucination people still have the ability to know right from wrong.When I saw Jesus being taken off the cross I was about to pull the tape out of the VCR and destroy it, but instead I watched on hoping that Jesus would go back before it was too late.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.  This is a warning to all you who have just met Christ and have welcomed him into your heart, Don't see this movie!  It will only clog your mind with false images of Christ and keep you from knowing who he really was.  For everyone else, I am not going to tell you not to watch it but what I am going to tell you is that if you do watch it remember the disclaimer at the beginning. This is purely a work of fiction and NOT IN ANY WAY connected with the true Christ who died for our sins.",The Last Temptation of Christ
105,sam_3,Narrow-minded Fundamentalists are justified!,1,1 April 2001,"I am certainly not a fundamentalist (who are they anyway?), and I hope I am not too narrow-minded as some are about ""fundamentalists"". The film, yes. As an art form, well, I'll get back to this later. Although it has been repeatedly been discussed over a decade, I still think that this film has not fully been criticized properly from a religious point of view. First of all, it is mere naivety to claim that this has little to do with Christianity. The film touches the core of Christian religion, so cope with it: i.e. should you wish to present a valid criticism of this film, for heaven's sake get familiar with the Bible first! Don't be gullible about one certain peculiar interpretation presented by Kazentzakis. Still, you may say that this is art, not necessarily aimed to bring about historical and theological accuracy. In other words, one may say that artists have their prerogative to modify or even pervert 'truth', or that they can exercise creativity. I suppose they do, but that does not bring us to the point. The point is (or was, rather) whether they had the sensibility to think about billions of 'Christian population' who love, believe, cherish, follow, and hope for the figure at stake, Jesus. Some seem to dismiss them as 'narrow-minded' or as ' fundamentalists (can you precisely identify who they are??)' who are incapable of tolerating the film. But I say, they are right to be mad! If you are one of those who love Jesus, how could you be so calm about it? And if you are not one of them, just leave them alone!!! It was so arrogant of the producing team to step into those peopleÕs heart (or soul, or spirit) and life. More to the point, it was extremely arrogant of them to portray Jesus disregarding the information and the intent of the primary source, yes the Bible! To that end, there is no question this film IS blasphemous (see how Ò'blasphemous' is defined in your dictionary). DonÕt be naive! Mis-understanding the narrative is one thing (even the Church has done this very often); at least there is an attempt to seek for the truth. But deliberately altering what is > clearly depicted as truth is downright unfaithful and thus to be condemned. Most films at least deserves to be on the shelf to be picked up. But there are certain films which do not even have the moral value to be there with others. This film is one of them.

I'm huge fan of his work. This movie is in line with his other religious epic 'Silence (2016)'.I appreciated what the movie was doing. I loved the way Jesus was portrayed ,struggling like everyone of us. We feel his dilemma , his uncertainty , his self doubt. Willem Dafoe gives one his best performances in this movie.But as Jesus was struggling with his temptations of lust, doubt and fear, I was myself struggling with my own temptation to turn this movie off. It does get pretty boring in the middle and my interest was waning.Still I stuck with it till the end and I'm glad I did. It was one of the most rewarding experience.

109,RovingGambler,One of Scorsese's best,10,19 July 2006,"This is a moving and powerful study of the battle between the spirit and the flesh of Jesus Christ. It focuses on the human side of Jesus, and by doing so it makes him much more identifiable by us, and also makes his sacrifice all that more touching seeing all the struggling that he went through. This is a truly inspiring film, that anyone, Christians or non-Christians, should not be afraid to see. Considering the small budget they had to work with, this movie is an amazing accomplishment, and should be cherished. I applaud Scorsese for following through with making it.Regarding the accents used by the actors: It's true that the Jews spoke with American accents, and the Romans with British accents. However, that's not due to an oversight by the director. In fact, he knew this movie would be tough for the general public to handle just because of the approach to the story (he was right), and didn't want to make it any more difficult for the audience, so he had them speak English with American and British accents instead of having them speak Aramaic. Now maybe that makes it hard for you to watch the movie, and that's fine if that's the case, but don't think that was somehow a mistake in the movie.Also, in regards to canadude's comment ""Jesus loses his virginity to a prostitute in Scorsese's masterpiece"", I'm not sure what he's talking about, because Jesus in fact does NOT lose his virginity to anybody.

Jesus saying ""...I want him (God) to hate me"".  Jesus unsure of himself and not knowing what messages to preach.  Jesus taking two wives.  Jesus having sex. No, this is not your typical bible story.Instead, it's a brilliant tale of the human relationship with God.  Every human being, whether they believe in God or not, has struggled with the question of God's existence, and this film tackles that uncertainty in a daring way:  by making the main character Jesus.Christ in this film is symbolic of man:  unsure of his purpose in life, unsure if God hears his prayers, constantly tempted by the flesh.  The bible portrays Jesus as omniscient, supernatural, flawless, filled with love yet stern, humble, and finally; certain of his purpose on earth.  ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" shatters the biblical image of Jesus Christ by putting him in our place as humans, making this film one of the most daring ever made.Paul Schrader skillfully adapts the novel by Katzantzakis, filling it with unforgettable quotes and dialog.  Michael Ballhaus's cinematography is breathtaking.  The performances (contrary to what I have read here) are outstanding.  Finally, Scorsese's direction is razor-sharp.

With that said, I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I felt far more for the Christ in this film than compared to Passion.  Temptation carries far more substance in terms of character study and spirituality as a whole.It's well known that this film is a fictional interpretation.  It's ironic to me that so many people were calling for Scorsese's head over this, even though many have said it restored faith in them and gave them more respect for Christ than ever; not because this film is true to the Gospels, but because it illustrates the likely reality of Christ in terms of conflict, temptation and eventual resolve to sacrifice himself for the sake of humanity.

Sentenced to death we witness the last temptation he encounters before being welcomed to the kingdom of God. Then Martin Scorsese happens.A brilliantly filmed movie with an excellent soundtrack by Peter Gabriel (ironic when you consider the apostle Peter and the Angel Gabriel). Seriously, it is an excellent movie that I would assume make religious folks proud to be Christian. William DaFoe has a hard role to play out and if he slips a little forgive him (we are all sinners). The Biblical accuracy is authentic and the cast (of extras that is) is actually of Arabic decent. With directing by one of our generations greatest and cinematography that will take you back to these sacred times we have here a religious depiction that rivals all.

The Last Temptation of Christ is a great piece of cinema, one that is also daring and personal on Scorsese's part. Predictably, the public didn't welcome this film upon its release. Reportedly Scorsese had to be surrounded by bodyguards for one year, during which time he also received countless bomb threats. A director who illustrates such bravery, willing to take life-threatening risks to explore a sensitive subject, deserves any film fan's respect.I have watched the film twice now, most recently with commentary from the filmmakers.

115,JackBenjamin,Psychology of God,9,19 March 2009,"I saw this movie when I was very young and knew little about Christianity. So I wasn't confused, disturbed, intrigued by the major modifications of the myth. I saw it as a valid world.Now, many tens of viewings later, one thing I'm marveling at (this time around) is how well Scorsese creates a world in which God is pervasive and expectation of the Messiah is palpable. God is the gluten that binds all aspects of his world. Today, that gluten has dried and weakened, parts have fallen off of the whole; in what remains God is vestigial, still other aspects show only his fingerprints. One test of a truly great work of narrative art, I think, is creating an entire universe that exists as some tangent to the one we know, then populating it with dynamic characters, breathing life into it. Scorsese-Schrader-Kazantzakis achieve this here.Something else that makes this such a unique exploration is how it probes the psychology of God. I can't think of another film that does, at least not as metaphor or allegory. But if you're like me and believe that God is a fabrication devised and developed by humans, it suddenly becomes a very potent thing to question His psychology, his motivation, his weaknesses, his aspirations, his complexities -- what does it say about us? Why is he tempted by a mortal life? Why does he fight his nature by breaking holy laws? What is he seeking? By trying to understand the nature of God, this film asks many wonderful questions about humanity.Those characteristic Scorsese smash cuts, creative camera moves, all those affectations that suit his gangster films so well, are given a new dimension with this subject. This might even surprise the director himself who in his commentary of Barry Lyndon seemed astonished by Kubrick's bravado in using a zoom lens in a Victorian drama -- the effect he claimed shouldn't suit the period, but it does suit the film. Last Temptation is a success in the same way. Scorsese mustered his own audacity and merged contemporary technique with an ancient story, and integrates the two incredibly well. I suppose Zack Snyder does this too, but 300 is an action film. This is a probing meditation on spirituality. Very bold (or maybe he just couldn't break habit).As for the the mise-en-scene (which a moronic film professor of mine once criticized), there is nothing glorious or Godly about it (punctuated especially by John the Baptist preaching in a bleached out, nearly dried up riverbed). The land is barren, awaiting the seed. It's a world in which you need a God to believe in beauty, since it's nowhere to be seen. I wasn't around 2,000 years ago, thank God, but I imagine a remote Roman outpost, with a heterogeneous stew of cultures, races, cults, religions looked a lot like this (minus all the white faces).One last thought I'm struck with on this viewing is how wonderful Harvey Keitel is.

At a very young age, growing up in a Christian household, I was confronted with the barbaric image of the crucifixion. It has always horrified me. The last section of the movie, starting with the crucifixion, had me bouncing all around my apartment in absolute terror. The movie had the courage to make me reevaluate all my most basic religious beliefs, and I found that terrifying. By the time the film ended, my heart was racing and I was surprised at how my faith in Jesus was strengthened.
The controversy surrounding this film is truly sad, not only because the Church chose not to check and see if their criticisms were valid, but also because the Greek Orthodox Church was the most vocal, and this film was based on a novel by Greece's greatest contemporary writer Nikos Kazantsakis. He's the same writer championed by his countrymen for Zorba the Greek, a book and film that boldly questions many of his country's antiquated and paternalistic customs. Definitely see this movie. This, like Martin Scorcese's other output between Raging Bull and Goodfellas (King of Comedy and After Hours) has been cruelly overlooked.

119,smitheeallen,Good film if you remember it is fiction,9,18 February 2002,"This film was out when I was 12.  I didn't see it until I was 25.  My parents, being devout Catholics, thought it was evil though they never saw it.  One of priest in my parish came and talked to my 7th Grade class when the film was out.  He had not seen the film but had read the book and seemed to have liked it.I am still a devout Catholic and I think that this is a good film. There are a few flaws in it artistically.  Especially in the John the Baptist sequence, it seemed like it was something out of Woodstock (which incidentally Scorsese worked on the documentary of that famous concert) than 1st Century Israel. There is some confusion with Jesus's relationship to Mary Magdalen if you haven't read the book.The one thing that I really liked about this film is that it explores mystery of the Incarnation.  The Incarnation is God became man in the person of Jesus Christ. What was it like to be both God and man? It is something that we will never truly understand.  Was it tough on Jesus?  I would imagine so.  (I am assuming, of course, that the Incarnation was and is a reality.)  Did he know from when he was a small child or was it more gradual?  I would assume the latter.  So does the film.  This film is a moving and powerful film.  I did not find it blasphemous.  One reason I didn't is because it is a fictitious portrayal of Jesus's life.  This is not exactly how it happened. Neither are the gospels for that matter but they are probably closer than the Jesus Seminar People would like to think.As for people saying the film was made by atheists it was not. Scorsese was raised a Catholic and still believes in Jesus.  The film is not athiestic at all because Jesus is God and man in the film.  People say that Jesus sins in the film, that is debatable. (Spoiler)  Jesus is not sinning when he comes down off the cross and marries Mary Magdalen, it is a temptation.  He rejects it and excepts his death on the cross, which is the most beautiful part of the film.  Building crosses for the Romans I had some problems with but I had to remember it is fiction.  (Plus, he was a carpenter and someone had to do it not that the real historical Jesus of Nazareth ever actually did that.)Fundamentalists don't like this film but I have a lot of problems with fundamentalists whether they be Catholic or Protestant.  I think that they are causing a deep wound in Christianity.  I think that they forget about the love that Jesus has for all humanity and think that it is just them he loves.  I think they are cancer to Christianity.  And their mentality isn't too far from the mentality of Islamic fundamentalists (note my emphasis is on fundamentalists and not Islamic).

However the books of the Bible which describe Jesus were written *~100* years later. These stories were distorted. For example one claimed the child-Jesus held out his hand & killed his playmates (a miracle). Another story said Jesus chose Mary Magdalene as his ""favored disciple"". Still another recorded one of Jesus' speeches & he sounded like a confusing mystic.In the end, the Jesus-portion of the Bible was created 200 years later! The Church took all these contradictory stories, kept the versions they liked and threw out the stories they did not like. End Result: What we see is not an accurate record, but a ""cleaned-up"" version with much embellishment & hearsay (""my wife's grandfather says his best friend saw Jesus..."") of dubious accuracy.So the result is that we have a *mythical* Jesus, just as we have a mythical King Arthorianus (roman general in britannia). .In contrast I think Last Temptation is very close to what really happened. It's still fictional, but it tries to recreate an historically-accurate tale (docu-drama):an average guy with moving speeches who drew crowds - who was uncertain of his role (it took him ~15 years between adulthood & the start of his mission) - and probably *did* sound like ""just another confusing mystic"" to those who heard himThe Church gave us the Gospels... a cleaned-up sales brochure of mostly hearsay w/ the apocryphal parts removed.

Everyone mentioned how fundamentalist Christians were offended by Jesus being shown naked, or making love to Magdalene, but NONE, and I mean, NONE talked about the dialog between Apostle Paul and Jesus.Short background, which summarizes the first 2 (torturous) hours of the movie: Jesus of the movie is pretty much the same Jesus depicted by the gospels. You can safely skip the first 120 minutes of the movie if you know the gospel story - you will not lose anything; Scorsese doesn't bring anything new here. After the 2 hour mark, Jesus is caught by the Romans put up on the cross. There, he has a vision of an angel, who offers to take him off the cross and give him a chance at a normal life. Jesus accepts, and goes on having sex with Magdalene (whom God later kills without explanation), then with other women. He has children and works for a living.NOW HERE'S THE CATCH: when Jesus is perhaps in his 50s, Apostle Paul comes preaching in his village, about - guess what - the resurrection of Jesus, and how the resurrected Jesus will save the world. Jesus is astonished at the lies and confronts Paul. The following dialog, the shocking gist of the movie in my opinion, ensues after the 2h22m mark:Paul (preaching to the crowd): And now I bring the good news to you - it's about Jesus of Nazareth. He was not the son of Mary, He was the son of God! [...] And He was punished for our sins. Then He was tortured and crucified. But three days later He rose up from the dead and went up to Heaven! Death was conquered! Amen!Jesus: Did you ever see this Jesus of Nazareth, after He came back from the dead? I mean, with your own eyes?Paul: No, but I saw a light that blinded me. and I heard His voice.Jesus: You're a liar.Paul: His disciples saw Him. They were hiding in an attic with the doors locked. He appeared to them.Jesus (going away): Liar. He's a liar!Paul (running after Jesus): Wait a minute, I wanna talk to you!Jesus (grabbing Paul by the throat): I was never crucified, I never came back from the dead. I'm a man, like everybody else. Why are you telling these lies?Paul: What are you talking about?Jesus: I'm the son of Mary and Joseph. I'm the one who preached in Galilee. I had followers, we marched on Jerusalem, Pilate condemned me and God saved me.Paul: No you didn't.Jesus: Who are you talking about?! DON'T TRY TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED TO ME, BECAUSE I KNOW. I live like a man now. I work, eat, have children. [...] So don't go around telling lies about me. Or I'll tell everybody the truth.And here it is, RELIGION IN THE MAKING:Paul: Look around you. Look at all these people. Look at their faces.Do you see how unhappy they are, how much they're suffering? Their only hope is the resurrected Jesus. I don't care whether you're Jesus or not. The resurrected Jesus will save the world, and that's what matters.Jesus: Those are lies. You can't save the world by lying.Paul: I CREATED the truth out of what people needed and what they believed.If I have to crucify you to save the world, I'll crucify you. And if I have to resurrect you, then I'll do that too, whether you like it or not.Jesus: I won't let you. I'll tell everyone the truth.Paul: Go ahead. Go on. Tell them now. Who's going to believe you? You started all this; now you can't stop it. All those people who believe me will grab you and kill you.Jesus: No, that wouldn't happen.Paul: How do you know? You see, you don't know how much people NEED God. You don't know how happy He can make them. He can make them happy to do anything. He can make them happy to die, and they'll die. All for the sake of Christ. Jesus Christ. Jesus of Nazareth. The Son of God. The Messiah. Not you. Not for your sake. [...] My Jesus is much more important and much more powerful.There you have it - how Christianity started. If Jesus existed at all, he was an ordinary preacher, who got crucified, and died. But a hopeful story survived, took over truth and reality, and got repeated ad nauseam to the point of very few questioning its origins.",The Last Temptation of Christ
122,CSM126-1,The Most Loving Portrayal of Jesus I Could Imagine,10,22 July 2005,"Condemned by Fundamentalists upon release, delayed by outcries from hypocrites and liars, and boycotted in any city where it played ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is one of the most controversial movies ever made. Instead of showing Christ as a fearless and perfect person, ""The Last Temptation"" depicts Him as a person who fought his destiny and wished to be just another mortal human being. Religious groups who couldn't (and still can't) accept the fact that Jesus was human were shocked by such ideas and refused to see the film or read the landmark novel on which it was based. They'll never know that they attacked one of the most honest and loving depictions of Christ.The Christ we see in the film is not based on the teachings of the Gospels, or any scripture for that matter. Instead we get a portrait of Christ the man, not Christ the Savior. We get to see his faults, his fears and anxieties. Then, we get to see him overcome those and find the strength to fulfill his destiny. The Last Temptation of Christ is not afraid to say that Jesus was weak before he became the Savior, and that makes the film all the more satisfying. This is a tale of redemption, courage, and love like no other.There is no reason to miss this film. Not everyone will like it, but at the very least it will let you see another perspective of the story. And even if you can't accept the story, you won't be able to deny the greatness of Scorsese's direction. From the epic crowd scenes, to the intimate one-on-one conversations, to the stunning final shot (which was actually caused by an overexposed section of film, but is beautiful nonetheless), you will be awed by Scorsese's work here.Also stunning is the work of the two leads. Willem Dafoe inhabits the role of Christ perfectly, bringing perfectly controlled emotion to each and every scene. Harvey Keitel as Judas has been the subject of debate because of his NYC accent. That was on purpose (Scorsese used accents to denote the descent of characters. American accent = Israelite; British accent = Roman), but it doesn't even matter. Keitel is brilliant no matter what his accent is.Honest, human, loving, and unafraid, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is one of the great cinematic achievements of all time. Martin Scorsese crafted with this film his most personal masterpiece, and perhaps his greatest masterpiece ever.",The Last Temptation of Christ

Truly top notch performances from the entire cast, I was pleasantly surprised by how they were so well in touch with their respective characters that I was able to forget who they were, what movies they've made since, and what ridiculous story the tabloids are shouting about them this week.Rarely are movies once considered controversial able to keep up that controversy through the decades, but I can see very easily how this can still ruffle feathers and cause heated debates.

124,Irate_Tyrant,The Best Temptation Is Usually The Last,10,20 July 2006,"""What's good for man isn't good for God!""The film of the century for our more religiously inquisitive minds was directed by the same man who gave us ""Goodfellas"", one of the more powerful depictions of the corruption and downfall for the Italian-American family? What a surprise! Well, let's be honest first and foremost, since most of our religiously inquisitive minds are anything but, I'm not exactly from the same vein as most atheists claim to be. In fact, if I were, I'd be strongly attempting to create severe stigmata.""Whosoever trusteth in the Lord, happy is he.""Oh boy, divine intervention can result in love, life, happiness, and crucification! Epilepsy and Tourrette Syndrome, as well, if you are one of those ministers that we all know and love so much. So the possibilities are really endless I guess, for Christians, and the film ""The Last Temptation Of Christ"" really, really proves it.Whoever did the casting for this movie, must have been on a serious acid trip. David Bowie plays Pontius Pilate, and that's one of the more LOGICAL acting roles assigned. I have to say, though, that Willem Dafoe couldn't have been a better choice for Jesus Christ, but that's an opinion that a lot of ""Boondock Saints"" fans will find hard to believe. Harvey Keitel is Judas? Excuse me, but I really, really didn't even see it coming, even after I had already read the credits. By the end, I was sincerely proud of him, but for the first hour or so of the movie, he made me want to shoot my foot. I guess that it's no surprise that ""Hershey Kisses"" could be something of a metaphor, either, but where the hell was Barbara in, uhhh, the entire stretch from ""Boxcar Bertha"" to this movie? I guess ""Hoosiers"" must have really pushed the envelope forward... So with all of the obligatory E!-style ranting on actors aside, let's return to the things about this film that actually count. Paul Schrader and Martin Scorcese. Oh, good point, maybe the 100's of people that contributed to the Bible kind of matter in some way, too. Not in the way most conservatives would be interested in hearing about though. No, this film was based on NOVEL by an Italian named Nikos Kazantzakis.My main point that I'd make with any first-time viewer of this film would be; prepare to be overwhelmed. Not only does this stray from the original doctrine, but it seriously agitates our predefined image of Christ. The portrayal of him here, is less than glorious. He first appears as a torchered sinner who's employment depends on the persecution of his fellow Jews. We are often put, throughout the film, into a state of confusion over his relationship to women. To top it all off, we actually don't even get a sense if he even dies at the end.The most potent scene to me, was his escape to the desert, where he is tempted in many ways by sin. Of course temptation must have been flaunting around with him from the very beginning, where he admits to a Rabbi that he is a habitual liar and full of hatred in his heart. Where'd all that wine COME from anyway? Also, important to note are the scenes with John the Baptist, his exile from Nazareth, and his promise to ""baptize with fire"". The cinematography, by Michael Ballhaus is unbelievable as usual by him. There are scenes of exquisite beauty, as well as stunning visual testimonies of pain and hardship. The eventual sex scene between Mary and Jesus was done very tastefully, and at times you can find yourself lost in the ancient world despite the low budget cost for the film.A couple of modern day miracles actually occurred during the making of the movie as well, and were allegedly totally unplanned by the producers. For example, the final scene where the camera shows Jesus on the cross, fades to white. Scorcese himself has adamantly told that this sequence happened by mere coincidence, and that the sun was just reflecting at a certain angle to create the effect. Also, interesting to mention, Willem Dafoe was temporarily blind for part of the shooting, for a three day period.Cynics of the film aside, this was easily one of the most spiritual movies ever made. Unquestionably thought provoking, and at it's peak a startling unstereotypical biography of one of humankind's most revered and idolized characters. A story, that with the duality of sin and love combined to almost complete perfection, has rarely been told with such outstanding results.""So Lazarus, how do you feel?""""The Last Temptation Of Christ"" (1988) 10/10",The Last Temptation of Christ
125,frickabee,The work of the devil,2,28 July 2005,"I watched this flick not knowing of the controversy surrounding it. Needless to say, a deep philosophical analysis of this film is not worth my time. Why are so many people wasting their time wondering what Jesus was like apart from scripture? Haven't you read the book of John, the one that starts ""In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and THE WORD WAS GOD?"" In other words, come to know the word and you will know Jesus. I've been studying the bible for ten years now, and the stupid comments I've read on this site speculating about how Jesus was probably mentally ill and comparing him to the alien in Stargate tells me why these people liked this film... they're imbeciles, doomed to spend an eternity continually being misguided by the devil. Say what you will about ""The Passion."" At least that movie was honest. This movie includes enough excerpts from the gospel thrown in to create dissentment among Christians and non-Christians, which I believe is the ultimate purpose in making this film. The scariest thing people can say is that they learned something about God from this movie. Well, if I learned something about this movie, it's that people are free and willing to accept God's love, but unwilling to accept His teachings, especially the writings of the apostles. How convenient.",The Last Temptation of Christ
126,rrfpaf-99858,"Front to Back Heresy, Front to Back Bad Writing",3,8 April 2017,"Having a degree in Biblical studies, i can say this is the most heretical movie I've ever seen. I stopped counting theological issues in the first 20 minutes.Aside from that, I still think this was a bad movie. The cinematography was great, but there was so much information with so little explanation. We feel like we can follow it because we've heard about Jesus before. If we put that bias aside, the train of though is confusing. Since i could go on a few pages, I'll shorten down to a one sentence summary of my frustration.The Last Temptation of Christ is a visually beautiful conglomeration of bad doctrine, inconsistent characters, historically inaccurate facts, pornography, and a jumbled/incoherent story line.Not recommended for anyone, particularly not for new believers or those who struggle with pornography.",The Last Temptation of Christ
127,wrcong,"Interesting, but not for everyone",4,23 September 2004,"I saw this film many years ago in a theatre in suburban Chicago. I went with a small group of friends and we decided on going to the late showing to avoid the possible protesters. We were right, there were two people there holding forlorn looking little signs warning me about something or other.Upon seeing the film, I concluded that the protests were much ado about nothing, and that if anything Scorsese appreciated the buzz the protests generated since this film was not all that great on its own merits.Peter Gabriel's score was tremendous. It conveyed an authentic feel as the scenes unfolded without the music being so intrusive as to become a distraction. As another commenter noted, the sound track may have been the best single feature of the film.Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Christ was quite engaging as well. It was understanding and captured the essence of the struggle that the novelist, Nikos Kazantzakis, and Scorsese were trying to capture. Although it doesn't get a lot of attention from present-day theologians, the possibility of internal struggles between the human and divine sides of Jesus Christ was a topic debated vigorously, often bitterly, in the early existence of the Christian faith. Dafoe deftly captures the idea of an internal struggle -- sometimes confident, sometimes terrified, the human Jesus portrayed by Dafoe wrestles endlessly with who and what he is. Finally, I think Scorsese's portrayals of the temptations of Jesus in the wilderness are quite creative and extremely well done. The idea that Satan appeared to Jesus in attractive forms makes considerably more logical sense than do the traditional portrayals of a hoofed and horned Satan skulking in the background whispering temptations to Jesus. Otherwise, the film was not wildly impressive. Harvey Keitel could have lost the Bozo fright wig he wore to make his character more credible. Harry Dean Stanton as Saul, after conversion the Apostle Paul, gave a decent enough performance, but the words he was given to say in the script were generally ludicrous. The notion that Paul didn't need the living Jesus, but relied on the dead Christ, is an important piece of theological and church history, but it came off too satirical to make the point. As it was, the portrayal of Judas as the disciple whom Jesus loved, and as the most worthy of the disciples, was predictable, even trite. The other male disciples mainly wander through the film in search of a clue. The controversial scenes, of course, were those which constituted the last temptation of Christ. Appearing as a beautiful child, Satan (with an English accent), offers to Jesus a chance to be a regular Joe. Marry Mary and then when she gets knocked off by the Romans, marry her sister. After all, ""there's only one woman in the world."" Therein lies a problem with this film. There is more than one woman in the world, but there was only one woman in this film, and her name was seductress. With the exception of the little English devil-girl, all the women in this film seemed to have getting laid by Jesus as their primary purpose in life. That portrayal of women is not one of Scorsese's finer moments. Frankly, it seemed to me that if Christians were going to get upset by anything in this film relating to sexuality, it would have been the scene early in the film where Jesus sits by and watches and waits while Mary Magdalene, the prostitute, services her clientele. That scene caused one of the little group I was with to exit the theatre and wait for us in the car. This film is not for the theological faint of heart. If you are open to the idea of a graphic depiction of one of the great controversies of ancient Christianity, then go for it. If it bothers you to think through the metaphysical and practical implications of a man being both human (frail, limited) and God (omnipotent, eternal) then this film is not for you.",The Last Temptation of Christ
128,davidgoesboating,Not your average Jesus film,7,2 January 2006,"This film begins with a disclaimer that it is fictional and not based on the gospels. This is just as well, as it slightly prepares the viewer for one of the most bizarre movies about Christ ever made. In contrast to the strong, silent character that Jesus is usually portrayed as (eg Ben Hur, King of Kings, Passion of the Christ), this incarnation is weak, emotional, and for much of the time seems completely off his head. Some familiar names such as Judas Iscariot, Mary Magdalene and John the Baptist have roles, but they are all also entirely different characters to the ones that people would be used to. Judas, for example, is a much stronger character than Jesus himself, and only betrays Jesus because he begs him to do so. It takes a while for the viewer to get their head around the role reversals and warped storyline, but everything (sort of) happens as it should, right up until the scene where Jesus is hanging on the cross. To state it simply, at this point things start to get very weird.The Last Temptation of Christ is incredibly unique, but is not for everybody. The film sometimes deviates quite sharply from the traditional view of the life and personality of Jesus, and there is a fair amount of sex and nudity, so people who have serious religious beliefs will probably feel uncomfortable watching. All the same, I would recommend this movie as a must see for any avid film watchers, quite simply for the reason that there has never been a film like it, and never will be another.",The Last Temptation of Christ
129,artihcus022,Last Temptation of Christ,10,3 November 2008,"Whereas other films on Jesus imagine a figure of charisma(including Pasolini's sublime Il Vangelo Secondo Matteo) Willem Dafoe's take on the Messiah is as uncertain as James Dean and Marlon Brando's rebel misfits of the 50's. His first sermon alienates more than half of his potential disciples. His most faithful disciple Judas Iscariot(Harvey Keitel in the revisionist role) is his most severe critic, who's torn between the rebellion of Jesus and the physical rebellion of the freedom fighters who want to drive away the imperialist Romans. The film ponders on what Jesus had to offer this apocalyptic world, and by virtue ours and does so in the most concrete of ways. What can love offer to a world which as John the Baptist says is filled with violence, corruption, false prophets. Jesus's struggle with his role, this contradiction is the heart of this beautiful and strange film.There's not much else to say about this beautiful film except that it must be seen by everyone and unlike other films about Jesus, it's open to non-believers and non-Christians as well. Indeed this film avoids much of the traditional Christian iconography. From the use of henna, and various hand patterns, the convincing costumes that are bereft of all European influence and also in its various details, like there being more than 12 Apostles, a significant portion being women, Mary is Mary and not shown and sanctified as anyone other than Jesus' mother. And it also ranks as the only film on Jesus to show women in large numbers in the Last Supper.The music by Peter Gabriel mixes music from across Africa and the Middle East with some electronic rock percussion thrown in for good measure. It's a film that reminds people of the little known fact that like Judaism and later Islam(one of the singers heard on this soundtrack is Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, the great Pakistani Qawalli singer), Christianity began in Asia, in the Middle East and not Europe, certain details and rituals suggesting connections with non-Abrahamic religions in both Africa and the Indian Subcontinent.Scorsese returns Christianity to its roots to make this powerful, sensual and spiritual film that is simultaneously the film of a Catholic but also one that builds bridges across the world.

130,Luke_was_a_terrorist,ridiculously blasphemous. .. but fantastic,8,5 April 2015,"First off this is coming from a non-believer, I was raised Christian but abandoned my faith at age 17 and haven't looked back. So the film is weird for me.On one hand I see it for the fantastic film it is, structure, editing, direction, acting, cinematography, production design all top notch. And while most biblical movies take the traditional route and leave Jesus as merely one note, this one offers the struggle of a man coping with his divinity. Which is what makes it so great, but therein lies the problem.On the other hand, having grown up a believer surrounded by other believers (my best friend was the pastors son and daughter), I completely understand way any Christian could, and actually should be offended by it(despite the disclaimer). What makes Christians Christians is Christ, and to question his divinity, in any way shape or for is blasphemy. Thinking of Jesus as half man and half god is not the way, he is all man, he is all god.So while many non Christians will scoff at a Christian who says they're offended, they do have a point. While portraying Jesus as a reformed man who struggled to become god, who thought about embracing the devil, who yearned for normalcy made a much better film, it is still pretty blasphemous for a believer. Hopefully they will be as open minded as you should be.",The Last Temptation of Christ
131,PKC,Jesus the Man,8,26 July 1999,"The Last Temptation of Christ is, appropriately, a serious and challenging film.  On one level, it effectively depicts what ordinary life must have been like for a Jewish peasant in 30 AD -- that is, pretty awful.  On a more complex level, it prompted me to ask, why would God (any God) choose that place and time to send his son to redeem the world? There is no adequate answer, other than, ""why not?""  It was as good or as bad as any other place and time.  For once we see a Jesus who is a man, unsure of himself, rather than serenely powerful and wise.  And his followers have all manner of motivation, from greed to politics to genuine devotion.  I have read that this particular era was replete with religious fervor.  There were all kinds of crackpot preachers and prophets, which is what many people considered Jesus to be. People seemed to hunger for something; this fact makes Christianity's success in the decades following Jesus' death understandable. Ultimately, I believe the effect of this movie depends on the values one brings to it.  An open-minded Christian could have his faith renewed by Jesus' triumph.  A skeptic can view it anthropologically, historically (though he can't explain everything that happens).  And a narrow-minded Christian may be outraged, because this version doesn't comport with all the accepted truths and myths he has absorbed.",The Last Temptation of Christ

It was totally different from all other Jesus-movies where everything is taken 100% literally from the Bible. In this movie, Jesus is the main character like in any other movie or book. You get to know him as a person who is not perfect in any way. You could say it is modernized so that we get a chance to think like Jesus must have been thinking. Scorsese has also modernized the dialogues and the music, which is excellently composed by Peter Gabriel.The movie has a good deal of blood in it, which some could say is overdone. Personally, I believe it contributes to portray Jesus as a human being and not as the son of God.The ending, or rather: the last 30 minutes of the film, come as a great surprise.

133,tmills777,Last Flim/Flam from Scorsese,1,10 February 2001,"Christianity has spread from its humble origins in Palestine to become one of the world's great religions; spanning the globe and found everywhere, even in places like Saudi Arabia. But looking at the lousy dialogue of this film, and the pallid Christ that Willem DaFoe presents, it becomes evident that this ""tempted"" Christ could never be the foundation of Jerusalem Welcome Wagon, much less a religion that numbers over a hundred million adherents. No, this sorry film was merely Martin Scorsese getting even for imagined slightsinflicted on him by the church.  He is better doing films like ""Goodfellas"" rather than religious films. The serious moviegoer is better served by such offerings as ""The Gospel According to Matthew"" and Zeffarelli's ""Jesus of Nazareth"" than this comic opera. Making good films about a religion or religious figure is hard enough, but this film, with its dreadful cast and woeful dialogue does not even come close to the pathetic ""King of Kings"". And the figure who is portrayed in religious films must convey the gravitas of a figure like Christ, and not the vacillating, uncertain and pathetic figure we see in this celluloid travesty.",The Last Temptation of Christ
134,Donny_Stay,A misstep for Scorsese,4,7 August 2009,"I'm not an especially religious person, so I'm not much concerned about blasphemy, but the main flaws of this film have nothing to do with blasphemous content anyway. No, the problem is that most of the film comprises a biography of Jesus, and fails badly at it.The accents are a serious problem; they're completely unbelievable in this context. Dafoe and Keitel never abandon their thick, urban American dialects; they sound like they're in an Abel Ferrara gangster film. I realize that this was intentional, since giving Jesus the traditional, vaguely beatific aura would defeat the point of the film. Nevertheless, this completely pulls the viewer out of setting -- I don't feel like I'm watching events of two millennia ago; I feel like I'm watching Brooklynite Christians put on an Easter play. The dialogue doesn't help: when Jesus asks, ""Are you ready for me?"", he sounds like a frightened patient in a doctor's office.The end result is that the Jesus character is completely unbelievable as a person who attracts a loyal flock of disciples and followers. Is this guy the Son of God, or the head of a stevedore's union? I don't mind Dafoe as an actor, but he does not possess the sheer force of charisma necessary to convince us that he is the Messiah. As a result, the entire film is lost.By the time the film reaches the controversial content, I've long since ceased to care, but since we're on the topic, it must be pointed out that the film has little, if anything, to say about Jesus Christ. In typical Christian teaching, by definition Jesus is a dual entity of God and Man that exists beyond the comprehension of mankind. Since God is by definition omnipotent, the Son of God, who is also God, is also omnipotent, and not fallible like a human, and therefore wouldn't have caved to temptation. The character presented in this film is therefore somewhat removed from the figure worshiped by Christians.So. We have a film that is an inferior adaptation of a well-known story, and which does little to enhance our faith. What are we left with? Well, not much. I might say that the film is worth watching simply to see an example of Scorsese's middle period, except that the film is nearly three hours long. If you have that much time to kill, and you really want to see it, go ahead, but otherwise, you aren't missing much.",The Last Temptation of Christ
135,SJBear,"One of the most moving, thought-provoking religious films ever made.",10,26 November 2001,"""The Last Temptation Of Christ"" is one of the finest, most-literate religious films ever made.  Those who protested at its opening in 1988, and continue to decry its ""supposed"" blasphemy of the life of Jesus, have obviously never seen the film and are acting upon only what they've heard. Those who claim that the film was made by athiests (or whatever they say) obviously know nothing about the film or the novel that it was based upon. The novel, upon which the film is based, was written by a devout Greek Orthodox (Nikos Kazantzakis); the screenplay was written by a devout Calvinist (Paul Schrader); and the film was directed by a devout Roman Catholic (Martin Scorsese).  To those who judge without facts, my advise is to see the film and judge for yourself. I first saw the film back when it first hit video in 1990 and I recently bought Criterion's superb DVD.  While I was touched the first time I saw the film over 10 years ago, I hadn't had a chance to see the film again until the other night.  The film this time moved me in ways that few films I have ever seen (and trust me, I've seen a lot of movies in my 35 years on this earth).  The film makes Jesus so much more approachable, by concentrating on His human side.  We are all taught that Jesus was fully God but also fully man.  However, no other film had ever presented Jesus' human side and as a consequence He always seemed so superhuman and so divine that it made Him seem somewhat unapproachable.  ""Last Temptation"" makes Jesus more approachable than He has ever been, and its my bet that no other work like this will ever surpass it. The performances are all first rate from Willem DaFoe's portrayal of Jesus to Harvey Keitel's Judas to Barbara Hershey's Mary Magdelene.  This is easily Scorsese's most personal film and could very well be the film that will in generations to come will be considered his masterpiece.  The film is also a wonderful example of how a religious film can work without being a huge, spectacular epic such as films like ""The Ten Commandments"", ""King Of Kings"", and ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"".

137,kirbyskay2012,"Off beat, but intelligent production",10,13 October 2013,"I saw this when it first hit the theaters in the late 1980s in Phoenix, AZ. I remember having to force my way through a long picket line of enraged Christians who were offended by the prospect of showing Jesus ""screwing"" Mary Magdalene.The movie was tastefully done, if not lavish, because it evidently was restricted financially by the studio--most likely from fear of how the general public might reject it. However, the production was profoundly interesting and had a tribal feel to it (with the drumming and the tattoos seen on many of the female characters).Willem Dafoe played Jesus very effectively, and the other cast members also acquitted their parts well. A surprise came in the form of rock star David Bowie as Pontius Pilate, but he also seemed the patrician Roman. The sets were few and simple, the costumes appropriate. It was odd that filming the movie contained several long shots superimposed over other shots that were a little too jerky in movement. I found the sound effects at the end very jarring and uncomfortable to listen to, but they didn't last long enough to be really annoying. This merely seemed an unnecessary tactic. The scenes during the temptations in the desert were somewhat off-putting, especially the plumes of fire which suddenly appeared shooting out of the earth and seemed so 1980s in design and out of place in an ancient biblical tale.As for the ""sex scene"", so over-emphasized by the crowds in the picket line, it was tastefully handled and lasted only a few seconds at best and showed nothing to inspire such objection. After all, this entire version was only ""a temptation"", as per the title of the film. Every other movie I have scene of the crucifixion of Jesus contained the same reference to Jesus being tempted to fore go the entire ordeal. After all, isn't Jesus a mixture of divine and human by birth? So why would he not have the same temptations as any other human? And, in this version of the last days of Christ's life, Jesus was legally married to Magdalene, so why would they not have a wedding night?To my way of thinking, this temptation only showed him to be stronger in his final resolve to fulfill his destiny. Those who staunchly refused to see this remarkable movie, simply because of a 30 second long scene, missed out on a thought-provoking story.For the full-frontal nudity (by Jesus and Mary Magdalene, as well as the throng at the river Jordan baptism scene), this is a little too mature for young children, but is appropriate for most teens. Watch this movie with an open mind and reserve your opinion until the final scene has played out, and I believe you will find is a compelling and worthwhile couple of hours, with little harm done.",The Last Temptation of Christ

If you think about it and see things from a practical perspective, that was what really happened, that apostles invented the Jesus divine character and de-humanized the real Jesus. Of course, the church and all religious 'psycho-rigids' minds wanted to throw this very good movie to oblivion. To their fortune, it takes more than a movie to change the general religious perspective of people, but at least more than one will think about it.",The Last Temptation of Christ
139,sliat_1981,This movie is rubbish compared to Passion,1,25 February 2009,"The numerous flaws with this movie are plenty. For starters, all the Jews have American accents (""Yeah man, so awesome dude"") and the Romans have British accent (""ooh rather chaps, I say tallyho, what?""). These seems to be the only two accents Hollywood will allow characters to have (unless you're senator Arnie). Also unlike Passion, they speak English. So what we have is basically a very American Jesus (and you though Costner was bad in Robin Hood). Willem Dafoe is probably the worst choice in history to play Jesus. He doesn't seem particularly serious about his role here (you are VERY aware he's an American in this movie). He seems to be playing his usual sort of role rather than a messiah. He's a pretty sex-obsessed Jesus. Whenever he sees Mary Magdalene, sex is not far from his mind. Mary is a prostitute in this movie, despite it is never once stated that she was in the bible. He sits there watching her do a client and he's obviously getting off on it (despite him teaching that it was a sin, so obviously this person can not have died for us as he is not without sin). And at the wedding he gets drunk! Now there is no religion that does not consider drunkeness a sin, so again Jesus sins. Jesus is making crucifixes. So this person who is supposed to be without sin is helping make devices for a public killing? Where does it say he did this in the bible? Also it says that his first miracle was making the blind person see, despite the bible saying that the water to wine was the first miracle. Harvey Keitel is the most unrealistic portrayal of Judas I have ever seen and deservedly was nominated for a razzie award. Judas is much braver and wiser than Jesus and much more devout and loyal than St Peter. Even though the bible states that he betrayed Jesus for money, the film decides to make up its own story about Judas and say Jesus told him to. If Judas was the most devoted why would Jesus ask HIM to do it?! Obviously the director decided to give Judas, Peter's role cause Judas is far more obedient, loyal and a closer friend to the one who was given the keys to heaven. Scorsese direction is lousy. He basically makes the characters act like all his other movies. New York mobsters. The characters seem like New York Jews, not ancient Jews. Even if they had changed the accents, you would be very aware that they are American. I think maybe if this had been more like an American-retelling of the Jesus story, set in modern times and dress, it wouldn't have been as bad because apart from the clothes and sets, that's what it seems to be. The whole principal cast is pale faced Americans and British (despite living in the desert), but everyone in the background is dark. Uh, hello, this doesn't make sense. Of course the famous scene where they show Jesus having a vision where he marries Mary Magdalene(now EVERYONE is assuming Jesus was doing her and that is the only reason a female would be allowed. Quite a sexist view really). And Scorsese got really horny directing and couldn't help putting a sex scene in (he must have had his hand down his pants when he directed that scene). I don't see how this is a temptation. Jesus basically gets to live a normal life (he gets to have his cake and eat it to), then he realises this is a temptation. So he asks to die on the cross. Not a hard decision, to go on the cross and live for 4 more seconds of pain, not the hardest thing to do. It seems that he got to live the life he wanted, then at the last moment, got to die for us as well. You can't have both, but Horny Martin Scorsese gave him both. This doesn't seem fair. To have a live of sex and freedom, but also get to die for our sins as well. There is a lot of nudity (you see everything for the females here) in this film and the sex scenes are almost pornographical. I can't believe Australia gave this an M rating. He doesn't wear a crown of thorns, he wear a skullcap of thorns. The thorns are large and long, so if they had really been pushed into Jesus' brain, they would have caused brain damage and he wouldn't have been able to move, let alone carry his cross. Also Jesus is crucified naked, with his legs lifted up, so he can tuck his penis between his legs. This kinda defeats the purpose as the condemned men, lifted up there legs to avoid suffocation. Also the Romans would not let Jesus to be crucified nude(he's so horny throughout this movie, it's a miracle he didn't have an erection). They respected the Jewish laws (Jesus' crucifixion was a Jewish-made request) and would not have allowed a naked body to be shown, knowing there was to be women there who by law were not allowed to view any naked body other than their husbands. If you want to see a close deception of Jesus watch the Passion. If you want to watch Jesus acting and talking like a New Yorker, being a sex-maniac and acting like a confused loser, watch this. The bible teaches us that Jesus was both God and man. This one tries to claim he was simply man cause there's no way God could be represented as such a bi-ploar person on the edge of a nervous breakdown. This movie is so silly, it's impossible not to laugh, let alone take it seriously. Watch Passion, not this.",The Last Temptation of Christ

But what abt the story? As the name suggests it is the last temptation of the Christ. The temptation when he is crucified , the temptation to lead a normal happy life with a family, With sons etc. The role of Judas was crucial and was done very well. He plays the most important role of giving enlightenment to Jesus when he is abt to be lured by Satan. Cant comment much on the truth as its fictitious.

Willem Dafoe is perfectly cast as a troubled Jesus, whose struggle to come to terms with who he really is and why he is here is a the work of not a good actor but a great one. The supporting cast also works well, with Scorsese regular harvey keitel excelling in the role of Judas, Barbara Hershey as the seductive yet troubled prostitute Mary Magdalene and David Bowie making the most of his limited screen time as pontius Pilate. Peter Gabriel scores the film, without doubt one of the most rousing soundtracks in cinema history.

142,vishvakarman,A religious viewing experience,10,6 February 2007,"This is a truly religious movie experience. My mind and eyes were riveted to the screen, for 2.5 hours I found myself almost in a state of trance. I felt that for the first time I was witness to a personification of the real Jesus of Nazareth. All the true messages of religion are beautifully highlighted. You can really feel with Jesus, his temptations by lust, by power, by conceit. Finally on the cross, his last and biggest temptation of simply living life. His story is truly the mirror of all our souls, and it is in this movie that the medium of film for the first time allows us to feel this truth.Only they should have left out the miracles, which everybody knows were added by popular myth and the gospels to aggrandize Jesus' simple message. I'm always annoyed particularly by the resurrection of Lazarus. Jesus doesn't need miracles.Thanks to everybody involved in this wonderful project!",The Last Temptation of Christ
143,rlaux,This Guy Had Followers?,2,4 July 2005,"After meaning to see this film for years, I finally sat through this clunker. So very little of Jesus' life was recorded that speculation on who he might have been is reasonable and fair.This Jesus, however, goes from being a whiny psychotic to being an ""in-your-face"" televangelist. Then he is fooled by Satan into wanting the kind of life that every decent, normal human being wants. The kind of life that Christians and everyone are taught is proper and pleasing to God.I like seeing Jesus portrayed as truly human. Seeing him struggle with doubt and fear as we all must. Having a wife or a girlfriend does not diminish him, it makes him seem more human.The Jesus in this film, at least as portrayed by Willem Dafoe, repels rather than attracts people.The most influential person in human history need not always be depicted solely as he is in the New Testament, but this interpretation is poorly thought out and poorly acted.",The Last Temptation of Christ

145,escctrlshift,One of Scorcese's Best,10,31 July 2018,"One of Scorcese's best Scorcese has made many great films and has to be the American film industry's most underrated and underappreciated director. Because of its controversial theme and the viewing public's general lack of theological sophistication, The Last Temptation is bound to remain one of Scorcese's underappreciated productions.In any case in the able hands of Scorcese the protagonists Jesus and Judas, played by Willem Defoe and Harvey Keitel, are made to provoke precisely the sort of doubt and cognitive dissonance that any spiritually mature person ought to have in assessing the doctrines of their religion. As Thomas Merton among others once reflected, profound doubt is necessary for profound faith and Jesus' story, especially as told here, bears that out.As The Last Temptation has it, profound turmoil and profound divisions in the human soul are necessary for it to realize greatness, or enlightenment. While I'm not a Christian I think this movie does far more to stimulate deep reflection upon the theological conundrum of Jesus' humanity vs. the Christ's divinity than any other portrayal of the Gospels' stories in cinema. Scorcese's direction and Defoe's performance together make this conundrum supremely provocative. There are apt to be as many interpretations of the movie's message as their are viewers. Personally I found the way Jesus' humanity is portrayed, and the way Defoe's character reveals his doubts and inner contradictions in discussions with Judas, makes the possibility of Christ's divinity that much more feasible. This is hardly an anti-Christian or sacreligious film as some have accused it of being -- it's Jesus as Everyman and God at the same time. That's pretty standard Christian doctrine no matter how you slice it!",The Last Temptation of Christ

147,Shanetmims,"One of the best religious films ever made,with a terrific performance by Wilem Dafoe!",9,8 May 2012,"Martin Scorsese.What can you say about him? The guy is one of the best, if not THE BEST,mainstream directors in film today. Everything he touches just seems to work. It's is hard to believe, but by this time last year, I had only seen one of of his films(for those of you wondering, it was, of course,Goodfellas). Now, in just the last four months, I have seen Raging Bull,Aviator,Casino,Hugo,Cape Fear,King of Comedy,Mean Streets,Shutter Island,Departed,Taxi Driver,and of course, the subject of this review,The Last Temptation of Christ.Now,before we start this review, let's address two things:one,I'm a Christian, and two:this film is not based on the Bible. This is based on a fictional book that is all hypothetical. I am a open minded Christian, so this approach didn't bother me much. But I understand this approach isn't exactly very popular, so I hope this review will help you in making a decision to see this film on not.So, on with the review.The Last Temptation is the story of Christ, but as you have never seen it before. In this variation of the story, Jesus(Wilem Dafoe)is a carpenter who is tortured by thoughts of a darker kind. He is unsure exactly of where these thoughts and desires are originating from:God or Satan. In order to get God to leave him alone, Jesus builds crosses from the Romans to crucify the rebel Jews, and because of this, Jesus is seen as a traitor by his fellow people, including Judas Iscariot(Harvey Keitel) and Mary Madaglene(Barbara Hershey),a woman he once had a brief relationship with, but has since become a prostitute.One day,Jesus gets fed up with the conflicting thoughts and voices, and so, he decides to go into the desert where he hopes God will make himself known to him. After a brief encounter with Satan, who tempts him with the desire to have a wife and children,Jesus calls out to God to save him,and God grants him salvation. Because of this, Jesus accepts his role as the Son of God, and begins to form the origins of Christanity. Although the final destination of the path Jesus is on remains unclear, in time more and more of his ultimate fate is finally revealed, as Jesus learns he is to die on the cross for humanity's sins.Eventually, Jesus does end up on the cross, and this is where he confronted with his final temptation:whether to give up dying on the cross to save humanity for a wife and children or fulfilling his role as the savior of mankind. What follows is one of the most profound, spiritual, and most heartfelt scenes I have ever seen, but I prefer to let you see the scene for yourself. My description of the scene won't do it justice.What a movie! What a cast! Dafoe has always been a terrific actor, but he is incredible here and he brings the movie to another level just with his presence alone. Harvey Keitel is great as Judas, Jesus's most faithful servant(like I said, this is not based on the Bible).I don't why he got such bad reviews for this performance;the way he delivers his lines is of sincerity and real emotional depth. Barbara Hershey is great as Mary. You really feel her pain of not being able to be with the man she loves, but also understand why it can never be. All the rest of the cast is good as well(David Bowie leaves a impression as Pilate), but those three in particular really stand out.Special mention must go to the score by Peter Gabriel. It is just hypnotic and really moving. One of the best scores in any motion picture. The sets are outstanding,the costumes are great,the direction fantastic,.............I just could go on and on, but I don't really need to. When you see this film, the film will just speak for itself.The only reason I am not giving it a perfect ten is that there all some weird moments in it,but I won't spoil them here. It didn't hurt my enjoyment of the film, and it probably won't hurt much of yours,either. One of Marty's best films!",The Last Temptation of Christ
148,cbarley,"The first ripple in a tidal wave of ""The Human Jesus"" films",9,8 February 2005,"First of all, let me say that, while controversial, this film brings a whole new light to the character of Jesus in Christian mythology. In the Christian belief, God sends down his son, or in some understandings IS his ""son,"" to repent for the sins of man; however, many believe that he did this also to understand the strange creatures of his realm whom call themselves ""Man."" God, being perfect, never new pain, loss, happiness, or even love as we do. Perhaps in order to understand his followers better - really figure out what makes us tick and why exactly we we have such a hard time following the Righteous Path. This is just what this film suggests.As Jesus, the Messaiah, is being crucified, The Dark Prince comes to see him as an Angel of the Lord. He, for some time, convinces him that he is not God's only Son, and that he need only wish it, and he would be permitted to live a contented, simple, life with those around him. This, when released, caused an uproar in the Christian community. Jesus was the Son of Man - how could he be tempted so? Because that's just it; he was the Son of Man, and human himself. For the first time ever, God new what it was to fear, to dream, even love like His disciples do. God as imperfect is perhaps a much more mature and sophisticated view than the perfect, infallible being of yore; the prospect of happiness, even for a short time, was enough to tempt even the most powerful of beings - a thought that really stirs in your mind for a moment. God is perfect, he feels no fear, no anguish, yet also no true love or friendship - he is, for all intents and purposes, a child, really - a simple being with no true character or personality. Yet he experienced something great: the realization of human emotions and desires; the uncertainty of a child who needs his mother, a young man unsure who long he will live and if he will be happy in the time he is alive.The film presents and interesting idea: that given his experiences, the pleasure and pain he felt as a human, would he actually learn fear as well? Fear that he would no longer be among the Tangible; that he would no longer be able to taste the sweetness of an apple; that he would no longer know the warmth of a friend's touch; that he would never again smell the clean air after a rain; or that he would no longer feel the mother's love he'd never before known. Given all that, wouldn't he, like the rest of us, become fearful that he would lose these blessings, never to again know the joy and sorrow they bring? Wouldn't he be tempted, even in the slightest, to throw everything to the wind, even the salvation he'd promised his people, just to feel these things for a little longer, no matter how short the time? This film presents a new way of seeing God and Jesus - as a being who came into existence and created All as a child, yet through his hardships and joys, matured into a complex, thoughtful adult.",The Last Temptation of Christ
149,legendsofrock2003,Last Tmptations reasons for existence,4,27 August 2006,"Looking at all the people who praise this film on the IMDb I find it hard to believe! This movie is terribly made! (And I'm a Martin Scorseese Fanatic!) This is one of two Scorseese films that I did not like! The majority of actors sleep walk through their roles (With the exception of David Bowie, who is the best thing about this film!) I do not condemn this film because of the controversial elements, after all, it does not teach that Christ did have an affair with Mary Magdalene, only that he was tempted to! (The Davinci Code, on the other hand...) I give it four stars for an attempt to show the human side of Christ! I applaud Scorseese for wanting to show a part of Christ that most people don't want to see, the Human side! But I feel that he went about it the wrong way, (The right way was with Jeffery Hunter in ""King of Kings"") the film moves very slow, which Scorseese films seldom do! This shows me that Scorseese was unsure about what he was doing, I believe the man has a faith in God, but that he was afraid of the possible negativity that the film would generate, therefore his usual pacing and brilliance did not shine through, I wanted to like this film, but I'm sorry, good ambitions do not a wonderful film make! I think that all the praise on the IMDb are people who are happy that Religious people were upset by it! How many of you have seen it more than once? Not at the box office, as the numbers would indicate! (Mel Gibson's film, on the other hand was seen by enough people to put it into the top ten money makers of all time!)

The highlight of this part of the film, is when Jesus realizes that his redemption from the cross was actually the work of Satan, who did not want Jesus to redeem mankind with his blood.

He would not be able to atone for the world's sins if He were to sin himself. It also trivializes the immense love that He had for us. Christ would indeed smile at our healing because He does not want to see His children suffering. I rated this movie a 1 to vindicate Jesus and His life.

153,simonk1905,"Great Film, Unfortunate casting of Harvey Keitel.",7,4 November 2002,"I saw this film for the first time last night and I can't say I was blown away but it was a really good film. Being a lover of Scorsese and a devout atheist then I would say that wouldn't I.Scorsese's direction is once again fantastic this goes straight into his top three films for me along with Raging Bull and Goodfellas. The only problem with it was the addition of Keitel. How a broad New York accent has any place in biblical Israel I will never know. The only thing that could have made me laugh harder was having Joe Pesci as Pontious Pilate.Mirth aside I think that the film would provoke thought in a stone. The way I am sure the book would (I am going to find it and read it ASAP). Defoe who has been in some real stinkers excelently plays a christ wracked with doubt who even though is given the power to raise the dead is still in the end desperate to avoid his fate on the cross.I liked Harry Dean Stanton's cameo as Saul/Paul and his sly insinuation that the apostles invented the gospels behind a locked attic door was very nice. Praise must also be given to David Bowie who did an admirable job as Pilate and portrayed the arrogance of Rome extremely well it was also quite ironic that in the film christ was crucified for the same reasons people tried to ban the film for, making people think.The score is excelent and I am no Gabriel fan.Of particular interest to me was the wedding scene. I thought it was refreshing that a religious figure can have fun. It was great to see christ toast his own miracle of turning the water into wine.As for the controversy surrounding this film then I can only say one thing. If you are a christian then I think you have real problems if this film can be considered blasphemous. If this can cause a problem with anyones faith in christianity then their faith must have been on the wane anyway.After all it was a film based on ficticious writings on the subject of a ficticous book (the bible). If you believe in christ good on you but don't let that stop us non believers questioning what you hold so dear. Jesus apparently brought a new way of thinking to the Jews I know this film is not going to change the world but the only way we can is by letting new ideas get the light of day.
In the end a good film but hardly blasphemy.....",The Last Temptation of Christ

155,pwallach,Scorsese at his most contemplative,10,2 January 2003,"The Last Temptation of Christ is a very rare film in that it is a serious work of philosophy which merits very serious thinking.  A radical reinterpretation of the gospels, the film offers what is basically the most serious look at Jesus of Nazareth I have ever encountered.  This is a film for people who are fascinated by religion but less than eager to believe in miracles--Jesus was a man who made the decision to be the messiah. I just read another user review that proclaimed that all of the roles in this film were miscast, but nothing could be further from the truth. Dafoe is captivating as Jesus, utterly believable as a tortured man rather than a biblical caricature.  Harvey Keitel's Judas is one of the most memorable performances I have ever seen.  The score and the cinematography are as good as in any of Scorsese's other works. In short, anyone who thinks seriously about both film and religion should find that The Last Temptation of Christ will be among their favorites.",The Last Temptation of Christ
156,d-cappella,The humanity overshadows the divinity,5,29 July 2009,"My original thoughts about this movie going into it were that: finally, somebody is taking a more realistic, relatable approach to portraying Jesus. It is clear from the Bible, that Jesus was human - he suffered temptation, he dealt with everything we did (including fear, doubt, lust, etc.). I believe it gives Jesus considerably more credibility knowing that he was human. That is one reason why I thought that this film really had something going for it.The first roadblock I hit was when it looked as if Jesus didn't just have doubts about his divinity - he honestly wasn't sure if he was God or just some crazy dude with weird dreams. This is where I think the film loses a lot of the serious Christian audience. It is almost common sense that Jesus must have known from the moment he met John the baptist (if not before) that he was God. It really irked me that God's interference at Jesus' baptism was completely skipped, there is no clearer event of Jesus' divinity than God, his spirit, and his son all being together and God even saying, ""this is my beloved son."" Jesus' entire ministry throughout the film seems to be based off of a half-guessed hypothesis that perhaps Jesus is God. Even the miracles aren't able to shake this feeling of lost legitimacy for Jesus' divinity.Also Jesus' ministry itself seems to be flimsy, Jesus himself doesn't seem to know what he is teaching. There is almost nothing on forgiveness, very little about the gospel message of salvation, and of course the thoughtful, yet concise and clear words are gone. Most of Jesus' words seem ambiguous, radical and unconvincing; one wonders that if the film is true, how anyone could have listened to him and believed (thats how crazy he sounds).All the above didn't especially bother me as much though as the ending scenes. Although apparently it is all a sort of vision or ""dream"" of Jesus it is way too real and is way too long and detailed for a dream. Why would Jesus dwell so long on a ""if"" anyway? It doesn't make sense and makes Jesus seem even less divine and weak. But what kills me and, indeed, infuriated me was the scene with Paul. I was under the impression the whole thing was a sort of dream, but if thats true, why Paul? If Jesus didn't rise from the dead and instead was saved without the resurrection or redemption, THERE WOULD BE NO PAUL. Paul was not some simple man who just wanted to tell people what they wanted to believe! He was persecuted from the beginning of his ministry until his death! There is no way in any conceivable alternate reality that he would LIE about Christ!! This mere idea is outrageous and a real insult to any Christian. Paul was an incredibly well educated Jew, who, defended Judaism passionately until Jesus appeared to him (and he actually saw him, not just an ambiguous ""bright light"") and he was able to see the TRUTH. What motivation would he have to spread a lie, to tell people what they wanted to hear?! To satisfy the feelings of humanity? Heck no, Paul was convinced that Christ had risen and that he was a witness to the risen Christ and that people should know the TRUTH. Why was Paul persecuted if he was just telling people what they wanted and what their feelings needed? If you ask me, the last half hour or so should be cut considerably, it doesn't add anything except confusion and oddity to both the plot and people's perceptions of Christianity.It is perhaps possible I have misinterpreted the last few scenes and that the message was in fact positive, but I still maintain that the very presence of such outrageous scenes (especially with Paul) is a disgrace to the movie and an insult to Christianity. After all Paul is the writer of half the new testament; even the suggestion of his entire gospel message being built on a lie is so distasteful it makes me want to vomit.But, like I said at the beginning, it still is a very interesting film at parts. The humanity of Jesus is often overlooked. But while examining his humanity it is paramount that his divinity is not marginalized because once that is done the entire Christian faith begins to look deceptive and unreal. It is important to stress that while Christ was human and was tempted, he was divine enough to resist all temptation and more importantly become the ""perfect lamb that takes away the sin of the world"" and overcome death in the resurrection.",The Last Temptation of Christ
157,diokokk21,the bolder suggestion for portraying Jesus Christ,10,2 April 2015,"Probably the bolder suggestion anyone made about Jesus existence comes from a man who surely admired his passion 4 doing what he thought of himself, challenging thus all of us to be as great (or as mentally insane as Jeffrey Meier suggests) as he was and start a world - wide cult of our own!Congratulations to Scorsese as well as Dafoe & Keitel for carrying out, as good as they could, such difficult tasks directing a ""i won't be bothered by anyone"" statement for the church, while being a true catholic/impersonating Jesus to the full of his fragile and wacko extend/impersonating Judas in the most humane & heroic way, as the writer intended).And how about Peter Gabriel's score eh?It is the first serious and legitimate try of various fractions of Christianity (Catholic-Scorcese, Orthodox-Kazantzakis,Protestant-Shrader) to produce an artistic and believable tale of accepting ones divinity and task.Can u imagine that back in the 80's we were forced out of the cinema where the film was played (xcuse my English!) by fanatics with crosses and Molotov bombs, accusing us for..BLASPHEMY (i 'll surely go to Hell for this I know it's chilling!)....?",The Last Temptation of Christ

Basically, in this story, Jesus is a ""hippie"" from the 60s. Jesus is a troubled and imperfect man, which flies in the face of orthodox Christianity. In fact, throughout the story I'm trying to decide if he's crazy or just running from God.The costuming is really, really good. From everything I've studied about the era (which is extensive), the clothing worn is authentic.The cinematography and look of this movie would rival anything that Ang Lee could put together. It found it excellent, not stunning, but excellent.The music by Peter Gabriel, former lead singer for Genesis, is good. It's a bit dated at times, reflecting the influence of 80s techno, but there are times it flows very well with the movie.Now for the main problem I have with it. It's boring. Granted, Scorsese is not Ridley Scott or John Woo, but dang! I found myself fast-forwarding through the speaking scenes at 2x so I could read them, but get through the movie quicker.This movie has just enough of the traditional Jesus story in it to be related to the Biblical story, but other than that, everything is different. There's no real interest to it. Jesus is presented as such a weak character, that you really don't care what he goes through, you just want it to end. There's not conviction, but a lot of whining and wondering about whether or not he's doing the right thing. Who wants to believe in a hero like that? This movie was adapted from a novel written by a man who was brought up under the influence of the Greek Orthodox Chruch and who was also a disciple of Friedrich Nietzsche. This story is about Kazantzakis' attempt to mix these two foundational components in his life, which is about as successful as mixing oil and water. The statement in the movie that sums it all up is when the disciples are arguing over the last words of John the Baptizer. When one disciple asks, ""How do we know the Baptist really said that?"" The answer given is, ""Everybody says he did."" Another asks, ""But how do we know?"" The answer given is the theme of the story. The disciple says, ""Well, even if he didn't, the words are still important."" This would lead one to believe that even though the Gospels are wrong, the concepts and words recorded are important because people believe them. The problem I have with this is if someone is going to base his/her life on something and devote him/herself to it completely, it better be more authoritative than this lame reason for belief. The story is flawed so don't come here looking for answers about true religion. Kazantzakis spent his life looking for answers and if this story is any indication, he didn't find them.",The Last Temptation of Christ
159,Pete-17,A Deeply Religious Movie,9,25 September 1998,"Despite what its critics say (most of whom haven't even seen the movie), ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is one of the most deeply religious movies I have ever seen.  What makes it so powerful is that it does not portray Jesus as an all-righteous, preachy figure; it portrays Him as a man.  He was the son of God, but more importantly He was human.  He could hurt, love, feel pain and joy, and He could make mistakes just like any of us.  He had to overcome temptation.  Martin Scorsese, for whom this was a long labor of love, directs a beautiful movie with all around excellent performances, particularly Harvey Keitel as Judas and Willem Defoe as Jesus.  The ""Last Temptation"" segment which draws most of the movie's criticism, is the most important part of all because it shows how close God truly is to us, if only those critics would watch the movie before judging it, they might realize that.",The Last Temptation of Christ

But there are at least two problems with this view:First and foremost, Roman Catholic doctrine clearly states that WHAT IS DONE IN DREAMS IS NO SIN because dreams are products of the unconscious mind; they do not involve free will, and the dreamer cannot be held responsible. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but the director makes it abundantly clear that what occurs in the final sequence is a dream.  In the end Jesus wakes up to recognize and accept his mission as Redeemer (""It is accomplished!"").Second, and on a more parochial level (pun intended), even if the final sequence had not transpired in a dream but in fact, where would the sin have been?  Jesus MARRIED the Magdalen, didn't he?  He was a loving husband and father, wasn't he?  Family values, no?Bless Martin Scorsese, Father, for he has not sinned!",The Last Temptation of Christ

162,adamkovic,An interesting alternative,9,9 February 2004,"I've seen many versions of Jesus' life story. Though I'm not a practicing Christian, his life has some magic for me. I liked the musical version by AL Webber, but its plot didn't differ a lot from most Jesus' movies. Always there was a clear distinction between the good ones - Jesus, St.Peter and his Apostles and the bad ones - Pontius Pilatus, farizees and of course, Judas. And small parts for women. I always felt something doesn't work right in these plots. Life ain't thus polarized. Scorsese must felt it the same, because he broke these axioms. The main hero, called by himself Son of Man has all marks of humanity. He does sin, he loves a woman, he collaborates with Romans and what more - he doubts. His doubts are so strong that at his first speech to the Nazarethans he doesn't know what to say. Then the God uses his mouth to spread a word of Love amongst the people. As Jesus said to Judas, these weren't his words. He is just a poor human looking for his God. But the God has chosen him to show his will. To tell the people of Israel, and not only Israel, that everybody can reach salvation. That they should prefer love to hatred. And that all uneasiness in this life will be awarded by Him later. Judas played by Harvey Keitel is another interesting person. A nationalist who wants to get rid of the Romans and to install a real Jewish rule. His task was to kill Jesus but his way of finding God persuades him to wait with the execution. Judas is his closest friend, who is not like the other Apostles (rural people without education) - he knows politics and he knows what he wants. After Jesus 'fails' to claim the throne of Israel, Judas refuses to punish Jesus for destroying his dream. Instead he is even reluctant to betray him. Jesus has to make him to do so, otherwise salvation of the world would be impossible. Apostles are a group of useless farmers and fishermen. After Jesus is captured at Getsemane garden, they runaway. No stress on their further deeds. They are not important for the story! Then came the last temptation. Vision of life with a beloved woman, children and so on. Saul/Paul later shows him that he is not important himself but his salvation and win over the death. Later a vision of elderly death comes. Apostles are useless again, but Judas is his true consciousness. Thus Jesus can fulfill his doom and choose to die on the cross, escaping the temptation of angelic Devil.",The Last Temptation of Christ

164,surfmantis33,"Moving, endearing, and ultimately triumphant movie",10,15 October 2002,"The Last Temptation of Christ is not an accurate depiction of the life of Jesus, nor does it claim to be. It is, however, an alternate take on how Jesus lived, why he lived that way, and what he really wanted. Detractors of this movie have labeled it as an utterly detestable manifestation of sin. But after watching the movie in its entirety, I can assure you that every scene in the movie is completely plausible, and could really have taken place. Who are we, as humans, to set down a basis on how Jesus lived two thousand years ago and expect ourselves to be infallibly right. I don't know if I have ever been as moved as I was finishing this movie. Here is a film that engaged me on the subject of Christ's double nature, that caused me to think about the mystery of a person who could be both God and man. I cannot think of another film on a religious subject that has challenged me any more fully. The film has offended those whose rigid views about God and man it does not reflect.

And I don't ever remember half of the events in this movie ever showing up in the bible.  Don't get me wrong, I like a good ""What if?"" as much as the next man, but Martin Scorcese takes so many liberties with the text that it's almost laughable.  To the film's credit, it has Scorcese's trademark style (of which I'm a huge fan).  Willem Defoe does a decent job portraying Jesus.  What makes this just weird, though, is the casting choices.  In my mind, Harvey Keitel does not make me say, ""Judas."" Not even with the redhead afro-thing.  I actually laughed when David Bowie showed up as Pilate.  I'm sorry, but Ziggy Stardust is not synonamous with Pontius Pilate.  The film makes some very thought-provoking points, many of them in the last half of the film.  This makes the first half of the film seem needlessly long and dull.  Couldn't the film have started at the Last Supper and have had the same effect?  Well, I'm not going to slam the film too much, because despite the bizarreness of it all, it's actually a very well made film.  I recommend it, if only for its discussion value.",The Last Temptation of Christ
166,joet1999,"One of Scorsese's Weakest, although still creditable",6,15 September 2012,"The Last Temptation of Christ, the film boomed out at me on my amazon recommended list and I had of course heard plenty about it since I am a huge fan of Scorsese so I scooped it up and a few days later it arrived through the mail, yay. I watched it last night and was instantly struck by the first 20 minutes which I thought was pretty painful if I am going to tell the truth, it just had no plot and everything just seemed to jump from place to place. This film dragged on greatly and let me tell you this, a film that is 2 and a half hours but feels like 5 hours has something wrong with it. Now I do not think that that little or big thing wrong with the film was Scorsese. Scorsese is one of the finest directors around today, he has made brilliant films from Taxi Driver to Raging Bull to Mean Streets to Goodfellas, and his camera work here was wonderful, this film was beautifully shot and felt so atmospheric, especially scenes in the desert which did, admittedly captivate me. Dafoe as Jesus was Oscar worthy and certainly played his part with sheer conviction and brilliance, it was a powerhouse and mammoth performance back then and still holds up now. But his supporting cast were no where near the brilliance of Dafoe. Harvey Keitel who can, at times, be one of the best actors around, gives a performance that earned it's razzi nomination. There was no conviction in the acting and it all felt just, wrong. His accent played horribly with the whole scene and I did not think he was a good casting choice at all. The rest of the cast was palpable, with some minor but poorly acted roles from Barbara Hershey and David Bowie, who has no business in the film industry. The Last Temptation of Christ is a one man show as far as acting goes and Dafoe manages to take acting very far. This film had an element of schoolchild-ness to it, it felt like the kind of thing you would watch in an RS lesson on a lazy summer afternoon when the term is drawing to a close. It just felt very long and overplayed, there was very very little entertainment factor to this film and I have doubts that I will ever want to watch it again. I would recommend this is watched by Scorsese fans like me or if you like long biblical films. 2 1/2 Stars.",The Last Temptation of Christ

Some Christians were throwing tomatoes at screens in the theaters. What happened to me, was that I was moved to the very core of my soul and spirit. I believe, this was the director's goal....to shake believers out of their apathy and the fleshly desire to simply enjoy ""an ordinary life"". To remind us that God was calling us to something deeper, greater, more fulfilling and ultimately glorious for our sake and His glory.It is, as was stated in the films opening credits (if only Christians had paid attention to that short little ""disclaimer"" and explanation), a portrayal of the struggle between the flesh and the spirit.",The Last Temptation of Christ

169,buystuff1_855,"A unique religious film: brilliant, but not for everyone",9,10 December 2006,"I first saw The Last Temptation of Christ several years ago. Its scenes and images stayed with me, and its philosophical and religious themes often reemerged in my own reflections and questioning about the nature of things. It's that kind of a film. Recently, I watched it again, and found it to be just as powerful as I'd remembered.Based on Nikos Kazantzakis' novel (which I have not read), Martin Scorcese's The Last Temptation of Christ is a provocative, haunting, fascinating film that really does rise to the level of a work of art. It may not be perfect (I thought it was longer than it needed to be, occasionally repetitive, and not every scene worked), but it is definitely a remarkable achievement, and one that I think should be regarded as a unique classic in the history of film.Most religious movies (and anti-religious movies too, for that matter) are content to just preach to their respective choirs  reaffirming already accepted beliefs and attitudes in an entertaining way that pleases those who share them and fails to convince those who don't (e.g. The Greatest Story Ever Told, Crimes and Misdemeanors, The Passion of the Christ, Dogma, etc.). The Last Temptation of Christ is, by contrast, a movie about a religious subject that confronts all beliefs and attitudes with a profound and heartfelt questioning. It challenges each viewer's perspective on the significance of Christ regardless of what that perspective is. It overturns any facile acceptance or rejection by placing Christ's significance at the core of our human reality. The movie forces us to realize that how we regard the story of Christ is a personally important decision with consequences for how we view the world and ourselves, and that we must make that decision on the basis of insufficient information and competing interpretations. In other words, this is one religious film that actually brings us to the point where we must make a decision of faith  and then leaves it completely up to us as to how we make that choice.The most effective method that this movie uses to shake up our preconceived ideas is one that hearkens back to Kierkegaard's ""Fear and Trembling,"" a philosophical work about faith. In that book, Kierkegaard examined the significance of the story of Abraham's almost-sacrifice of his son Isaac by giving us alternate versions of it  versions that were satisfying or impressive in other ways, but none of which had anywhere near the same power to convey the unique message about faith that exists in the original story. In its most memorable sequence, The Last Temptation of Christ shows us a version of Jesus' later years in which he attains a righteous, God-fearing, happy human life, but is not the Messiah sacrificed for the sins of the world  and then makes us see just how much is lost to the world if that is all that Jesus achieved. If it is not unique, unsurpassable, and true, the story of Christ is virtually meaningless. And this movie makes us feel the emptiness of that possibility as a stark contrast to the triumphant ""accomplishment"" Jesus regains in the film's final scene.The two most controversial aspects of the movie are, first, that much of its story is outside the bounds of the familiar Gospel accounts of Jesus' life, and second, that it presents a very human depiction of Jesus, one that is frightened, uncertain, conflicted, and capable of making mistakes (although he never breaks a single one of the Ten Commandments in any of the scenes that are not described in the Gospels). To view these aspects of the movie as an attack on Christianity is, in my opinion, misguided. The Gospel accounts give a cryptic, fragmentary, and somewhat contradictory narrative of Jesus' life, and everyone who encounters this story forms their own understanding of what Jesus was like and what he did (and that understanding may go through a lot of changes during one's life). Everyone fleshes out the story in their own way, and it is legitimate for a novelist or a film-maker to do the same, especially if they are trying to illuminate human truths. Also, while the most orthodox Christian description of the nature of Jesus Christ is that he was ""wholly human and wholly divine,"" nearly every conventional Christian-themed Hollywood movie ever made has portrayed Jesus as being perfect, infallible, unassailably courageous, and completely aware of his destiny  in other words, wholly divine but pretty much just going through the motions of being human. Without ignorance, uncertainty, fallibility, weakness and fear, how can one really be said to be wholly human (assuming that one does not agree with the Mel Gibson conception that excruciating physical pain is all that's required)? In the Christian theological tradition, denying Christ's humanity has been considered as much of a heresy as denying his divinity. Obviously, there's no such thing as a completely accurate portrayal of Jesus of Nazareth in any form of art, but at least The Last Temptation of Christ, in its Jonah-like portrayal of the Jewish carpenter overwhelmed by a relationship with God he cannot understand, gives us a characterization of the man that we could imagine having a personal conversation with, and even befriending and caring about, instead of being limited to the pious but dehumanizing sterility of uncomprehending awe.The Last Temptation of Christ is not a movie for those who want safely reverent retellings of the story as they know it (for those, I'd highly recommend the beautifully done Gospel of John). But for those believers and non-believers who are open to a profoundly artistic meditation on the essential meaning of Jesus' story in human reality, Scorcese's film is a masterpiece.",The Last Temptation of Christ
170,shifty1032231,A Masterpiece of Thoughtfulness and Care - One of Scorsese's Most Undeserved Underlooked Film,10,13 May 2007,"The Last Temptation of Christ has really never been discussed for its message and imagery because of a block of the far right religious zealots who believe that questions and a different approach are sinful. I believe that this film must be viewed because it is, besides Pier Paolo Passolini's The Gospel According to St. Matthew, the best film about Christ and the best representation of him.The film is not based on the Gospels and that is stated at the very beginning. This film is a adaptation of Nikos Kazaktaskizi's (spelling) novel under the same name. This film holds to tell the central dogma of Christianity even though those who most believe it and oppose the film don't accept this view. Jesus is God and Man and it is important to look at the human side of Christ. The human side of Christ is essential to the nature of Jesus because Jesus overcame his fears of death, leading people, and starting a revolution. How does it feel to be the son of God. There is a heavy burden and great responsibility. Besides Passolini's film the representation of Christ by the church is not accurate in films and church paintings. Jesus was a carpenter and he had to be strong, he is human and has flaws, he possess human nature and desires, and questions his own existence.This film is about thoughts than a biographical approach. The real biography of Jesus will truly never be known and this is where interpretation is created to be the truth. The largest points are with Jesus' relationship with Judas. Judas had to turn in Jesus for the ultimate sacrifice. He is not the enemy as depicted pitifully in Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ but the force for Jesus to bring Salvation. Jesus had to die to save our sins and Judas is the reason for that to happen.Paul Schrader's screenplay is thought provoking through the conversations asking who, what, where, and why. Jesus is always asking questions and Judas is there. They don't find answers but understand them to further God's message through them. This review does feel as a defense against the controversy by the religious right who don't see in the messages of charity, helping the poor and homeless, live good lives, and don't fall into the temptations of greed and lust. Scorsese's approach feels historic with real people who felt that they truly existed. These are not cardboard cut out images from the biblical epics and the blandish tapes by the over zealous Billy Graham and false priests of sinful self created churches seen on TV and marketed to people to get rich. Scorsese's cinematic techniques in the cinematography and imagery along with Peter Gabriel's superb score make the film a masterpiece. No wonder why he is nominated for a best director at the Oscars.Please before you make up your mind on this film, see it first. Its easy to jump to conclusions but those wont be the right ones. This is one of Scorsese's best films.About the Reviewer: I am a Irish American Roman Catholic. I do not attend church every Sunday but I do my best.

172,sidiknugroho,Woman and Kids,9,29 April 2006,"Jesus of Nazareth, Jesus (Campus Crusades for Christ), The Passion of The Christ and another movies of Jesus of the Bible assumed in the same way: they were told the story about Jesus as Messiah. The focus on these movies was the miracles and salvation He brings to the world. Christians worship and adore Him as God, but sometimes forget that He was fully a man, too, when He lives in this planet. That was the movie attempt to show: the both-side personality of Jesus as God and man.To make the story acceptable, the movie makers don't use the Bible as the main source in its screenplay. The manly of Jesus that shows on this movie have became a controversial talking. But, in the opening credit, said that it was written by fictional exploration of Jesus' life. So, it would be better to see the movie based on that view.William Dafoe, plays as Jesus, looks like great in his performance on this movie. Actually, he plays some bad characters or antagonist in another movies. I think the other character that has a big significance in this movie was Judas (Harveoy Keitel). In the Bible there is nothing special mentioned in relationship between Jesus and Judas, like that told in this movie: Judas is so close with Jesus; even He not starts His ministries yet.While I'm seeing the movie, it makes my mind sounded some questions. The most hard-answered question is this: Why Jesus told Judas that his ""duty"" (that is, betray and over Him to crucify by taking some money) is a harder job than die on the cross to forgive human sins  that was Jesus does? That shows in this movie, Judas was commanded directly by Jesus to do the ""duty"". He looks so sad when he accepted the ""duty"". He loves Jesus. Maybe, the answer is this: the salvation must be comes through the death, so the one who makes the death happens, he has done his ""duty"". The ""duty"" must be doing, even Judas doesn't like it at all to do. But, I'm not sure this was the right answer.The screenwriter (Paul Schrader) of the movie is brilliant. He challenges us to think about men usually need in life: woman and kids... a family a common happiness. What if Jesus decides not to obey what God has commanded Him to do? Then he makes an imagination that Jesus gets married and has some children. It comes when Jesus almost finished His salvation on the cross. Based on the Bible, the last temptation was not the imagination. Gethsemane, that was the place He found the last temptation: to do God's will or not.This movie looks like to challenge our reflection. What kind of self-will-obsessions conflicts in a person who has the-both personalities? Roger Ebert, the famous movie-reviewer write, ""I cannot think of another film on a religious subject that has challenged me more fully. The film has offended those whose ideas about God and man it does not reflect. But then, so did Jesus."" Perhaps, when Jesus decides not to die on the cross, Christianity knows the consequences: neither salvation, nor eternal life after death people will find.",The Last Temptation of Christ

It's obviously a work of fiction and it makes no sense to me to test it exclusively for realism.  Perhaps I don't have much vested interest in the scriptures themselves and am free to appreciate this film purely for its artistic and philosophical value.  Perhaps a litmus test for being able to appreciate this type of art is one's take on ""Master And Margarita"" (the book).The film is thoughtful, well acted, well directed, and overall complex.  I tend to enjoy long features as they usually don't have the feel of a good work compromised to fit into too short a time frame.  This film filled the long running time well.  It's a character study more than anything else and the Jesus' character portrayed was definitely multifaceted and conflicted. I find those qualities to consistently make for interesting and thought provoking films (see ""Mishima, A Life In Four Chapters"", ""A Simple Plan"", ""Pollack"", ""Sylvia"", ""About Schmidt"" to name a few).Peter Gabriel's score is brilliant.

175,grey-fox-kw,Truly Satisfying,10,8 July 2006,"I must say that this movie is one which you are bound to remember for the rest of your life. It's one of those special movies, which were made in the good old times of lesser commerce and more artistic/philosophical value. While the beginning seems trivial and insignificant, later on it reveals to be not only another mundane Bible story version of the life of Jesus, but a most inspiring vision and contemplation about the duality of this figure. The movie shows Jesus not as the simple, passion-driven demigod portrayed in the Holy Book, but tries to sketch a different scenario, of Jesus as a man who, unwillingly, becomes the one destined to sacrifice himself in order to save the world. Dafoe plays a man who struggles, who doesn't understand God's divine plans for him. He acts as a normal man, he experiences fear and anger, joy and sadness, but is constantly haunted by visions, voices calling out for him as the Son of God and the prophesied Messiah. The interesting part of this movie is that it illustrates the crucial events of Jesus' life from a different, fascinating and intelligent point of view (Judas' ""betrayal"", Jesus' being rejected by the Jews, etc.). It doesn't shield itself by the traditional ""it had to be so, because God wanted that"", but even asks and answers questions itself in a non-blurred manner. From a technical angle, I liked every part of the movie ; the actors, the music, the script, the scenery. Even though the dialogs are not the so called Bible-sophisticated, they are performed very nicely and skillfully. In my opinion it's far better than the (also ""scandalous"") Da Vinci Code in every way, basically because the case's center is not a primitive idea which is bound to wreck the catholic Church, but many philosophical layers surrounding the core of the idea itself. I hope people will find this production as interesting and profound as I did.",The Last Temptation of Christ

177,HippieRockChick,A Voice Crying in the Wilderness,7,18 June 2014,"I'm not even getting into the theological discussion here, just a tiny logical one. I was raised Catholic and jumped ship in my teens, at the earliest opportunity, so I'm pretty well versed in, well, chapter and verse. And I have thought from my tiny logical childhood that Judas did everything God asked him to do, so why was he always blamed for it? (Cue nuns with rulers...) Well, religion, at least Judeo-Christian-Islamic religion, has always been short on logic and introspection. Which is why I'm not bothering with it any more than that.Okay, then. I thought that this was pretty interesting, what with the tantalizing possibility set forth that maybe Jesus was just a martyr to migraines or perhaps a small brain tumor, and the victim of schizo hallucinations. And a good case is made for this. But Willem Dafoe is not the actor one would choose to convey such delicacy and nuance. His affect is flat as a pancake and his slowness of delivery puts John Wayne to shame. Plus the blond hair and blue eyes are only slightly less ridiculous than the Lucky Charms leprechaun red hair of Harvey Keitel as Judas.The acting and script in this flick are a general disgrace, and just about what I'd expect from the ham-fisted direction of Martin Scorsese. The only exception, and by far the best performance in this dismal camel-opera, is that of David Bowie, in a lamentably short scene as Pontius Pilate. He was superb, and I don't understand why people always dis him for his acting chops. He can really pull a memorable performance out when the chips are down (""Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence"". ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"", ""The Prestige"", Broadway's ""Elephant Man"", yeah, even ""Labyrinth""), and his turn here is like Roman carving in marble, incisive, bright and razor-sharp. I wish the part had been bigger.So six stars for Mr. Bowie, and one star for Juliette Caton, the little girl who plays Satan. Though Bowie could have pulled that off too, I'm sure.",The Last Temptation of Christ
178,Eleanordent,"Dreadful, mainly",2,6 February 2016,"A few years ago I saw this film from the crucifixion scene until the end and thought it was very thought-provoking. I recorded it and watched the first half a few nights ago. I thought I ought to watch all of it before making a judgement but Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Jesus made me want to throw something at the television. It wasn't his fault, though; the material was appalling. For one thing, there is nothing in the Gospels to suggest that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute. At least two unnamed women have been assumed to be Magdalene throughout the centuries but this is pure supposition. I thought it was an interesting departure from the Gospel accounts to have Jesus know both Judas and Mary before His ministry began but the depiction of Mary having sex while other men watched was completely gratuitous. To show Jesus the carpenter making crossbars on which the Romans would crucify other Jews is ludicrous. No-one would have followed him or listened to anything he said if he had done this. The naked women shaking their hair around in the Jordan while John baptised also doesn't ring true. The scene in the Temple where Jesus overturns the tables of the moneychangers was one of many wasted opportunities and shows that the author of the novel and screenplay didn't know what to do with what was a good idea. I did love the scene where Jesus was tempted in the desert but it's insulting the intelligence of the audience to suggest that the 30-year-old man doesn't know who he is or what he is meant to be doing when the Gospel says that he already knew his purpose when he was 12. I turned off halfway through as it was such a disappointment.",The Last Temptation of Christ

TOTALLY disregards the Sacred Scriptures...OLD and New Testaments as pertaining to Christs' mission... but the forward on the movie lets one know this up front... and whats amazing is that even with this forward, people STILL blather about how THIS finally, is how the Lord should be depicted...uh, huh...Riiiiighhht.

180,ni-8,Too often misunderstood,10,22 September 2007,"Rarely has there been a better depiction of the nature of Jesus Christ than this. When compared, for example, to the almost gratuitous violence of Mel Gibson's ""Passion"" this film offers a depth of understanding that far outstrips any previous or later cinema attempt to get to grips with Christ. Scorscese has not approached this work with anything other than one of the most sincere attempts to explore the person of ""God made flesh"".This film has Jesus doing nothing that he is not told of doing in the Bible. The ""offensive"" scenes are visions presented by Satan to Jesus as the last temptation of the title, an attempt to disrupt the agenda that Jesus was working to.One of the abiding dilemmas of Christianity is how was Christ's death a sacrifice if he always knew that the resurrection would follow? However in Scorscese's masterful depiction the nature and extent of the sacrifice is made apparent. Rather than seeking to ban this work the Churches should have embraced it for the insight it brings. Of course, we all know that scandal brings viewers in so perhaps that's what they were really trying to achieve!",The Last Temptation of Christ

It was when he was on the cross and he vision himself having an affair with Mary Magdelin (i think that is how you spell it). It never stated in the bible that happened, but other than that, I still give it a thumbs up because Willem Dafoe did a great job portraying Jesus. It is not a waste of time, it is a good movie with a good plot (that to me is important to have a good plot or the whole thing is a waste of time). I have to say I would watch it again and again.

It starts with one word. Religion. If you have blind faith in what you've been taught you whole life, then the mere sight of the opening scene is going to turn you off. And then the movie will drag on like a bad, scratched, old record from some garage sale ""old-records-for-5-cents"" box. Turn it off, go back to the ""other Passion movie"".But guess what, Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ is not child's play. It's not easy stuff to chew, swallow and digest. For one, it was written in Greek. Then there's the movie's main theme and star character. Jesus of Nazareth. Who's NOT (by the way) the guy you've heard about. Kazantzakis's Jesus is a troubled man. By today's standards he's schizophrenic. He's also indecisive but a charismatic and inspirational man who has a problem authority: the Jews, the Romans, and yes, God. Then there's another interesting phenomena that is perhaps equally troubling to some minds, and that is Judas's portrayal. He's also not the guy you're used to hearing about, but instead a rather intriguing interpretation which bears much resemblance to early gnostic portrayals. The characters in this film are complex to say the least. They challenge very forcefully our ideas about Christianity, religion and faith as a whole. It is in fact an exercise of philosophy that actually leads to the appreciation of this piece of cinematic history. I first saw this film as a child. My parents made me watch it. For years, I went to sleep every night listening to Peter Gabriel's fantastic score. I was captivated by the ancient sounds, the mystical tones, and the vibrant rhythms. I couldn't care less for the film. It was boring!As an adult I've watch this movie at least a dozen times. Every time thinking and researching for weeks afterwards. Willem Dafoe and Harvey Keitel are an outstanding pair on screen. Even in their off beat accents and looks, the actors offer world class performances. Dafoe's intimate personality on screen is ever too relevant in this story. Keitel's interpretations of one of history's most hated individuals, Judas, is straight out of his own gospel.Scorsese made this as any art director would. He set his film in a truly spectacular setting, Hired a famous musician to direct the score, and then shot the cast in a very candid way, exposing the very complexity of Kazantzakis's work. There aren't any long winded scenes of lacerations or colossal battles between good and evil. There isn't really much action. As a result, the film is boring and dull to most movie audiences.To those who appreciate art, philosophy and reason. This film is for you.Everyone else, keep watching ""the other Passion"".",The Last Temptation of Christ

Yes, I know a lot of people got worked up about this movie. Religion always breads controversy. If you watch this film don't expect it to be biblically correct that's not the point.It's a different look at a Christ who has the wants and dreams of a man. If you're a Christian, watch it with an open mind and enjoy the cinematography!Scorsese did this one on a small budget and it took him years to get it made.

185,cow005,Scorcese saves Jesus from meaningless interpretations,10,14 March 2002,"There was a time when you could say, ""Jesus was human, too,"" and it meant something.  Thanks to the likes of countless one-dimensional portrayals (the Jesus film, Greatest Story..., etc), that very profound, very true, very important statement has come to mean nothing.Forgetting what it means for Jesus to be a man completely invalidates what it means for Jesus to be God.  Jesus' being all man and being all God are inseperable.  But most films gloss over the 'all-man' aspect without exploring what it really means to be tempted, to be fearful, to be weak, to be lustful, and to always wrestle with what it means to be the Messiah. The Last Temptation of Christ explores what it means for Jesus to be man by focusing on some very human questions that all men of greatness must confront.Scorcese's movie, based on a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, takes the Jesus of platitudes, cliches, and proverbs too often quoted without thought or context, and turns him into a Jesus of rich personal dilemma, of great love, of great care, and of true capacity to be a saviour.Kazantzakis/Scorcese make Jesus a real person again, they save Jesus from tired and meaningless understandings of his character.  This brilliant team, fully realized by the acting of the cast, put human motivations and therefore purpose into the story of Christ's struggle.",The Last Temptation of Christ
186,aba139,"Nice cinematography, interesting images, that isn't enough for me",4,2 December 2012,"Most of this review was written after I had watched about half of the movie.Nice cinematography, interesting images don't make a real good movie for me. That is not enough.In the first about 45 minutes I had some interesting moments watching the film. I am sorry, but it was at times comical to me, which I enjoyed. And there were moments of understanding, the dispute: first the body, than the soul or the other way round. A discussion and dispute you can take as a blueprint of disputes of mankind in general. Which concept is the right one, and nobody wants to admit, that you can't really know, you can only decide for yourself which concept you follow.But then more and more the film becomes telling the good old bible story, and than it was no more good to me, more and more boring... What the film made very clear to me, how ridiculous the story is, our whole western culture and civilization is build upon. The dialog and the ""events"" make it so much clear, if you don't believe in the truth in or behind it.I think the film should be part of the content of a time capsule, so that hopefully there will be a time in which people watch it and can't find the clue why this story became such a success and frightened the hell out of millions and millions of people, so they believed it and built everything upon it....The film didn't convey any convincing emotions to me. The involved characters and Jesus just felt not really emotionally involved enough in their convictions, which seem to have come out of the blue - : ""God told me so, I didn't understand it myself at first"". But you can't really feel or are convinced that: ""now, I finally understand"". ...A quite interesting casting of Americans and Arabs(?) for the characters, guess who is who. Maybe Scorsese should have transfered the whole set of the story to New York. That would have been more convincing, I guess, but would have been a very different kind of project.I finally made it through the film, but not without skipping scenes. If you are not a believer of the story, it is unlikely to be interested enough to watch this interpretation.To sum it up. Without believing the words they are saying, the film was not able to convince me through the images or the emotional involvement/portrayal of the characters (the acting is not persuasive enough).The film failed to does to me what it was set out to do. In my opinion you need to believe the story in advance, otherwise it is tiresome to watch it. I could only watch it with the spectator's thought, that it is really impressive how much people who want to believe something, seem to be able to believe almost anything. IMHO it was a waste of money and time to make and watch this movie, not to mention the waste of the tantrums at the time of it's release. I can think of thousands of better projects to invest in.English is not my first language and I don't have to use it often enough, that's why I hope I was able to say in some degree what I really wanted to.",The Last Temptation of Christ

188,Kurenai23,Three Hours of my Life I Desperately Want Back,1,26 December 2006,"Wow. What can be said about this movie? It doesn't just flirt with blasphemy; it treats blasphemy to dinner and a show before an evening of heavy petting at the local lover's lane. This alone will rile many viewers, but it does not bother me. My problem with this movie lies in an entirely different direction.(May Contain Spoilers)This movie is a triumph of execrable writing, pretentious dialogue, and acting for which the word ""bad"" is entirely insufficient. After seeing Mel Gibson's brilliant ""Passion of the Christ,"" with Semitic-looking actors speaking in Aramaic and Latin, watching Harvey Keitel in flaming Irish red hair and Brooklyn accent play Judas was a real shock. There are other shocks in store, such as a John the Baptist; who, rather than preaching repentance, incites Jesus to violent overthrow of the Romans; John's disciples, who are either in the grip of religious ecstasy or crippling madness (I found the three nude women swaying their heads in unison and mumbling incoherently to be particularly disturbing), and one mind-bending scene in which Jesus pulls out his own heart with one hand while holding an axe in the other.The movie's main problem is Jesus himself. Willem Defoe's Jesus is a wimpy crybaby. He could give Anakin Skywalker a run for his money (""I don't *wanna* be the Son of God! I wanna go to Tahashi Station and pick up some power converters!). And speaking of Star Wars references, Satan's temptation in the desert seems to have been lifted from Darth Vader's ""Luke, join me"" speech. Not that the effects budget of this turkey matched that of a Lucas film--""Satan"" in that scene seemed to be a flaming gas burner buried just under the sand and turned up on ""hi."" Jesus' self-pitying lines (""my God is fear,"" etc) ensured that I would feel no sympathy with this character.The cinematography was visually jarring and unpleasant to watch. The casting was woefully mismanaged. I have seen all the ""anglo-Jesus"" films, and a Brooklyn Judas and blonde, bushy-bearded Midwestern Nathaniel would have been easier to take had not the supporting cast looked like they all came from Southern India! The heterogeneity of the cast torpedoed all suspension of disbelief. For the final insult, Scorsese employs the ultimate narrative cop-out: it was all a dream! Or a hallucination, or whatever. I realize this was the ending in the book, but the movie could have been something better. The purpose implicit in this piece of cinematic excrement is the de-sanctification of Jesus Christ by ""filthy dreamers"" who ""despise dominion and speak evil of dignities (Jude 1:8),"" and I have no problem with that. My problem is that this is a Martin Scorsese film. The same guy who gave us ""Goodfellas"" and ""Raging Bull"" shortchanges his audience with this pretentious garbage. I expect better from a filmmaker of Scorsese's stature; even if it is blasphemous, a movie should be good! I am mystified by the praise lavished on this compost pile, and I tell you truly, ""polish a turd, it's still a turd.""",The Last Temptation of Christ
189,DemocraticEmpire01,The perfect combination of propaganda and preaching,7,14 March 2005,"Martin Scorsese definitely has a gift of film-making. That said, many people want to know about this movie in terms of The Passion of Christ, a more recent film.Wilem Dafoe is definitely not as convincing as Jim Caviezel in the role of Jesus, but then you have to remember that the two movies focused on entirely different points. This focused on and celebrated a twisted and fictional version of his life and the experiences that led him to become the savior that he is remembered to be today, while The Passion aims to show the last twelve hours of his life. Caviezel was more dramatic, but Dafoe was very passionate. They both embodied Jesus in very memorable performances. Why they were overlooked in awards selection is baffling.Overall, this film, aside from being a work of fiction, had one flaw that took away potential viewership: timing. Scorsese's films are excellent but films such as this and The Aviator had lots of parts that could be fast forwarded. The ending music and overall score is one of the most memorable scores in film history. Keep in mind that this is a fictional epic and enjoy it for what its got to offer, forget about the controversy and for your money's and time's worth, you've got a pretty good deal. 7/10",The Last Temptation of Christ
190,miguelsantos31,What this Picture is Real About.,9,19 December 2006,"One of my favorite Martin Scorcese's pictures and one of more touching movie ever made about Jesus life and passion. This picture brings us a revolutionary idea of Christ history, from the baptism to the cross/resurrection. The movie opens with a short text by Nikos Kazantzakis, about the dual substance of Christ, followed by the warning that the movie isn't based in the Gospell but upon the exploitation of the everlasting conflict.I think this pictures was so controversial when it was released because the human point of view of Jesus Christ that is presented. Its relationship with Magdalene and Mary, sister of Lazarus, were saw as scandalous to not opened minds.(Also the nudity scene when Jesus is crucified and the sexual relation with Mary Magdalene after her ""savement""). After all, this a movie, not a real story about Christ last days as «Passion Of Christ» by Mel Gibson. We can't see this work neither as historic or a religious statement, but as a adaptation of Greek writer Nikos Kazantkakis novel. And this novel was written in 1945, the year in which World War II was over, millions of people have perished at the hands of Nazis, Fascists and Soviets Governements. The Roman Church has done nothing to save millions of life during this days. So we can read this novel as a strong criticism to ever desire of Man trying to reach GOD by fascist or communist rulers. When we see the Last Temptation of Christ, we have to think that this so-called TEMPTATION is the human desire of Man attempting to reach God.In the beginning Jesus is a man who makes crosses to the Romans, in which Jews are crucified. I think we can acknowledge that in the Chuch as an institution that has persecuted Hebrew people through the Medievaland Modern Times that is real murdering Jews. When Jesus talks with the monk of the monastery where he has spent one night, that he doesn't steal, doesn't kill, doesn't love women, not because he wants because is afraid of everything , I see that as the Fear put on people minds by Catholic Church during medieval. The fear of being arrested by open mind, the fear of the everlasting Hell, if their rules weren't accomplished.At last, this is a fictional picture about a real flesh and bone Man that existed 2000 years, that has lived among us, had doubts about his place on time and in HIstory, and that is believed as THE SON OF GOD by thousand of people around the world.Be a open mind to watch and love this movie.Luís Miguel Santos",The Last Temptation of Christ
191,crazyfilmfanatic,Mesmerizing stuff from Scorsese!!!!!,10,12 March 2006,"Most people go to churches and temples without bothering to actually ponder over the true meaning of religion. Religion, be it Christianity,Hinduism,Islam........ is based on a 'story' from a 'sacred holy story book' that portrays a human(s) who despite all obstacles emerges finally to save the world, by sacrificing himself for the sole purpose of annihilating the evil.All success stories no matter how big or small, are always at the basic level a fight against temptation. A successful athlete fights effectively the temptation to take it easy and relax, a good student fights the temptation to sleep early in exam days, a honest police officer fights the temptation of accepting a bribe.and so on. Success in life and defeating temptation are two sides of the same coin.Now Scorsese's movie (this one the closest to his heart) is conveying just that. The Jesus in this story is completely unsure of himself, in fact he is weak, he needs Judas to protect him, hold him. He, just like all of us wants to lead a normal life, get married and have kids, and why shouldn't he?? But no, he must not, he cannot, because that would come in the way of god's plan. So does he just tell his heart, 'Look, don't tempt me to live that life, I am born for a different purpose', and the heart would say 'All right, I'm sorry I didn't realize that, 'click' there, I turned off the temptation switch, it wont bother u any more' We all know its not that simple, temptations are a part of human life, thats what makes us who we are. So the movie portrays beautifully, the constant inner voice of Jesus asking god 'Why me??, don't I deserve a normal life??'. Finally he fights all the temptations and is crucified, but when he feels the monstrous pain of the nails biting through his bones through the wood, the mortal human side of him resurrects, and is again over come with the desire to say 'hell with it, I don't care ,I'm outta here'.***Spoiler**** And thats when the often misunderstood and controversial portion of the movie begins. The lord of temptations 'satan' deceives him into accepting the life he wanted, he gets married to Mary Magdalene, has children, grows old and is about to die an old man, when he is confronted with the truth that all this was a sham.He asks for forgiveness from the almighty and is granted just that.....and 'bam' he is back on the cross........elated to find all that just happened was just his whole alternate strayed life compressed into an ephemeral moment, the whole package designed by god to convince him that this is the righteous path....the solution to his life's conundrum, the end of all miseries.The problem is that we aren't as fortunate, we don't have the luxury of living the whole life and then begging god to put us back to the place where we succumbed to temptation. So the beautiful moral of this story is that to succeed in life, you gotta overcome the temptations of daily life that hinder your progress.I find this the most powerful portrayal of Jesus Christ in any movie. Most of the previous movies, show him as born a god, so he doesn't have to fight any temptations, he just has to get crucified. I say 'What's the big deal in that??, If I was god I could do that too.' But no I'm not one, fighting the temptations in spite being a human might bring me closer to one though. Will make me realize my dreams. Make me successful. Reach my final goal. Just how the real Jesus must have done it. And that's why this movie is so special. It approaches the subject of Jesus's personality from a different and more plausible perspective.",The Last Temptation of Christ

It is and it gives you a disclaimer saying it is, so having the story written differently shouldn't make the rating lower unless the viewer was REALLY wanting a EXTREMELY accurate story of Jesus which most say is history and that's why it's written differently to show a different side of Jesus that's not heavily depicted in some religions.For me I thought it was a 8 or 9 because of it being technically done well and having a engaging story. It's not a 10 because the story isn't that gripping. but good performances by Defoe and good story telling from Scorsese and the writer. Isn't perfect but very good.I urge that people who will write reviews will rate what they actually feel it's rated. If you think it's sacralisions and poorly written and poorly directed and had absolutely no correlations to Jesus and would rather see a cat Defaecate for 2 1/2 hours then of course give it one star!

You're irrelevant.""",2,7 March 2004,"The line, paraphrased from Paul's comments about Jesus in this movie, pretty much sums up my opinion of the movie.Misguided, cheaply produced, and boring. I came into the film with higher expectations for a director like Martin, and found myself alternating zoning off or put off throughout. Perhaps a ""more human"" Jesus was necessary after the other religious extravaganzas of the past, but this Jesus is so human, confused, unstable, and bewildering that he is not a person anyone would look up to, let alone follow or die for. Ultimately, as a character, he's uncompelling, and his ""struggles"" left me more unattached than interested in their outcome.I'll grant this: For one moment, in the Garden of Gesthemane, Jesus almost came to life, tormened, wracked with agony. But the moment quickly faded, along with hopes for the movie.Worse, the ""last temptation"" experienced by Jesus was a sellout. Jesus never actually made a choice between two things; he ""had his cake and ate it too,"" living his first choice to its natural conclusion before going back and taking the other road. In so doing, he actually sacrificed nothing but ""had it all."" Savior? Sacrifice? The notions are irrelevant here.
For a cast full of truly top-rate actors, most performances were either over-the-top or flat and underwhelming. Other cast choices (such as DavidBowie, for Pilate) were simply jarring. Sets were bland, the directing sterile, the dialogue alternating between vague colloquial slang and philosophical banter.Whatever one's opinion of Gibson's ""The Passion..."", it's still clear that his version of Jesus (both human and divine) was more compelling than this far-too-human, not-enough-divine compromiser.",The Last Temptation of Christ
196,xxxjb007xxx,This film is superb.,10,9 February 2000,"Most cinematic depictions of Christ show a perfect being, a one-dimensional person who is overly self confident and almost egotistical. I can never relate to those films, so they aren't believable. The Last Temptation of Christ is totally different. It was banned by intolerant Christians who didn't even see it because they have conflicting viewpoints, which is one hell of a paradox. I use to say that Christ was described as a demi-god in the Bible because He is half-man and half-god, but I was told that He is really all-man and all-god. If the latter thesis is correct, than he most have all the perfections of god as well as all the faults of man. In the movie, Jesus is not perfect. He sins, or at least, He confesses sins. He is haunted by visions and sounds almost to where He goes on the brink of insanity. He is tempted by Satan over and over again into thinking that he is just a man. When He cures a person of blindness, He does not smile, he frowns in pain because for every man he cures, he knows it brings him closer to the cross. The characterization in this  movie is excellent. This script is Schrader's best, although it was rewritten. The music is the best I've ever heard in any films. Scorsese's direction was absolutely superb. Willem Dafoe and Harvey Keitel were excellent as well. And the movie leads you to the most haunting portayal of the crucifixion in cinematic history.It is a must for any person to see, especially if you were outraged by the fact that Jesus is displayed as imperfect.

There is not a moment of the film where I was not engaged (and it is over two hours long!). Not having any idea what the film was about (or, more accurately, not know what the ""last temptation"" was), I went through a pretty emotional state thinking that the novelist and filmmakers might be the MOST subversive Catholics ever--but the ending is fabulous :-) I also like the standard Scorsese ""gang"" quality to Jesus and his apostles.

Willem Dafoe as Jebus may be a stretch for some, too bad the director couldn't get old standby Robert De Niro to play the lead, but Scorceses other stock character actors are all in fine form, ...bad lieutenant Harvey K-Tel as Judas and Harry Dean Stanton as Saul/Paul love it! David Bowie as Pilate reminded me of Hugh Grant, definitely Bowie's best acting on film to date except maybe the ""merry Xmas Mr.Lawrence"" soft porno he did with Riocheeki Sakogucci... John Lurie (Down Boy, Lawd!) overdoes it again, but his scenes are thankfully brief. Unfortunately, when Peter Gabriel gets into those W.O.M.A.D World Baloney Beat with drones drowning out the dialog it is SO annoying. Yuck... what a waste!",The Last Temptation of Christ
200,tamar_basilaia,The victory of divinity,10,13 December 2010,"maybe you are surprised, but I do think that this film has a lot to do with all of our lives and it was as touching for me that I would relate it to my life first.I would say, that I was raised as Christian and was always taught a lot about Christian doctrines, but you would probably agree with me if i also say that the bible and sacred scriptures just can't be reachable and as understandable for teenagers or little kids as they are supposed to, or as our parents or fundamentalist people think about them to be. That's exactly why I actually never really understood the purpose of all these and I have to admit that I was going to become just one of the fanatics I was surrounded by.but I could still change this and start my own way of finding the truth about everything. it's probably not hard to understand either, that just starting it without anyone and without any help, is kind of difficult. What I did is that I looked for all the movies around that could explain me something that I needed, it could be about Christians or about any other kind of religion communities, their lives, traditions and cultures in general, for comparisons and better-developed conclusions.After reading some articles or watching different movies, I want to say that, this is one of the best that does not just describe the life of Jesus, but it's directly related to what the new testament is. such a human nature in Jesus is just so sensitive for anyone who watches it first and starts criticism after. I would say that it makes everything even more clear, than any fictional books or movies have ever made. yes, Christ was a human first. that's what should be emphasized. We are all human with the soul that any human had before Christ was sent to us, and everyone is still born with it. there are all these temptations around us and that's what makes a difference - there is another side, there is the god and it's revival in our mind is what is called divinity. Christ did have the same feelings and temptations and yes, he was tempted but in the final part of the movie he does not accidentally change his mind but he consciences his role, he understands the importance of it and his human nature dies while god's divinity becomes victorious.I still don't know how matchable my opinion is to more accepted and scientifically studied opinions but I consider this movie to be an example for not just Christians but for humanity in general about winning the battle against temptations.",The Last Temptation of Christ

202,rajah524,The Critics Missed the Point,10,22 September 2003,"Most have castigated it. Some have praised it. A few have tried to understand it from secular and religious points of view. I have yet to find anyone who's written about it from a truly spiritual-which is not to say religious-point of view. Being a somewhat studied Buddhist and devout 12-Stepper, I found my understanding of a Power Greater than Myself considerably enhanced by Scorsese's portrayal of a man who comes to his own spiritual clarity *over time*, rather than suddenly. William James wrote extensively about the Varieties of Religious Experience in a book so entitled, as well as in numerous monographs, essays, lectures, letters and published articles. His research into how people acquired faith demonstrated that most people come to it begrudgingly at first, then with increasing willingness, and finally with a level of comfort that requires neither effort nor self-righteousness.Though they are in the minority, there are many modern theologians who point to the apostle Paul as the author of notions about instantaneous enlightenment in Christian doctrine. Nowhere in any of the four gospels (all of which were written a minimum of 70 years after Jesus said adios for the last time, by the way, indicating that oral tradition had to stand up for at least three generations before commitment to written text) is it said that Jesus *arrived* here aware of His destiny; what is presented is an awareness near the end that the end was coming, that He would be `betrayed,' and by whom.That He comes to see the necessity of His assignment from God--to bring release from the bondage of guilt and shame about sin for hundreds of millions over two millennia--*is* the point of TLTOC. Scorsese also makes it clear in his speculation that God put Judas Iscariot in Jesus' path to make sure Jesus fulfilled Papa's obligation. Does the Bible suggest anything remotely contrary to this view? Scorsese's Jesus prays for God to `If it be Thy will, take this thing from me.' Does the Bible suggest anything remotely contrary to that, either?Most critics, professional and amateur, friendly and hostile, focus on Jesus' sexual moment with his speculative spouse, but the book and film pay greater attention to the man who followed the Devil's subtle seduction into an honest, forthright, middle-class, familial existence which was certainly no descent into ""moral hell,"" though it *was* a diversion from Jesus designated *purpose* here. What's significant about that is the home-hitting metaphor it offers for the not-so-awful, but nonetheless materialistic--and very much non-spiritual--middle-class family lives most of us lead in the modern world. Who are we to cast any stones?Orthodox Christians took issue with the author's speculations about Jesus' `identity crisis' and His passages through several diverse self-identifications. Given the actual events going on in Roman Judea at the time, they are all within the realm of possibility. Beyond that, however, is the orthodox notion that no one should veer from dogma in any fashion. Does that conform to the principles of love and tolerance Jesus reportedly taught?TLTOC is a *speculation*; it's neither propaganda nor hostility aimed at orthodoxy. And as such, it advances ideas into the framework of Christianity which are both underpinned by modern research of the early Roman Occupation period and by widely accepted notions from religious traditions which considerably pre-date that period... ideas delivered to us by the same Essene Jews who wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls.Finally, those who attack the film on the notion that Christ is portrayed as anything other than the pre-ordained Messiah must have seen some other film. or, more likely, not seen this one at all. That they wish to believe their idea that Christ happily and unerringly pursued his destiny is fine. That they wish to force that idea upon others to the exclusion of other *possibilities* is nothing more than intellectual fascism.Herbert Spencer said, `There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance-that principle is contempt prior to investigation.'",The Last Temptation of Christ
203,nuttyknatty,THE BEST TELLING OF CHRIST'S LIFE (SPOILERS),9,29 June 2004,"The Last Temptation of Christ is the best retelling of the life of Christ. The brilliant idea that as a carpenter, Jesus made crucifixes is just genius! The concept that Jesus refused/ignored his 'calling' is handled extremely well and I think Willem Defoe pulls off one of his finest performances as his character (Jesus) struggles to come to terms with the voices in his head. That said, the performance of Harvey Kietel as the wonderful Judas surpasses Defoe's. The relationship between these two characters is superbly written and the viewer really feels for Judas when he is forced, by the man he grows to love, to sacrifice Jesus and then live with this AND then find out that the guy double crosses him anyway! The depiction of Jesus as a married man and siring a tribe of children is handled well although it does throw up a confusing scene with Paul. Ultimately this film portrays a well known character (probably the best known character!) in a provocative and thoughtful manner. It is a refreshing depiction and, whilst it initially may sound like a dull 'serious' film , it's very entertaining (even if you think this religion business is all a load of old tosh!)",The Last Temptation of Christ
204,omar-43,"The author of novel, the director or movie, and the composer of soundtrack.",9,24 November 2006,"I have read the book first by Nikos Kazantzzakis. Then I have bought the soundtrack by Peter Gabriel, as I am a huge fan of his works. But I watched this movie by Martin Scorsese in 1992, years after it was released.I think this is one of those movies that can be fully understood if the audience had brief knowledge of the novel's author. Nikos is a devout Christian who had a hard time grasping and accepting that Jesus was both man and divine. So he wrote his novel The Last Temptation Of Christ as a way to explore and accept why Jesus was both man and divine.The novel itself is very deep and might require some readers to read it more than once. Also a good knowledge of Christianity will help tremendously. If anyone had read the book, then there's more hidden and powerful messages embedded deep within Scorsese's film, to be realized and/or captured by the viewer/audience. Obviously Scorsese couldn't possibly turn the movie 100% like the book, but he did incorporate a lot from the novel into this film ... by rich visuals and masterful editing ... rather than just acting with dialog.Practically, Nikos' story of The Last Temptation Of Christ is a big question: Was Jesus man and divine at the same time? How so? Man is weak and prone to unholy temptations, while being divine is being strong, godly, and resistant to any evil temptation. Nikos struggled with this.In order for Nikos to reach a conclusion that Christ was in fact both man & divine, the author takes us to the day Jesus was crucified which is when he asked God, ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?""And right there, in the novel and this film, is when the dream-sequence begins. A little child who claims to be the guardian angel approaches Jesus and releases him from the crucifix. At this very moment, Jesus is no longer divine but 100% pure man, like any other man.As Jesus comes down from the cross, he is invisible to the eyes of the people around him ... he walks away ... but the rest of the people are still staring at the crucifix as if Jesus is still there.The story continues to follow Jesus as an ordinary man ... committing adultery ... marrying Mary Macdalen ... society around him goes into turmoil ... Jesus cannot save them. Until the very end, when the world is tumbling down all around him, only then Jesus cries out one more to his Father. And that's when Jesus wakes up to find himself back on the crucifix. And this is when the audience learns that it was all just a dream-sequence. Thus Nikos finds his answer, after he put himself in Jesus' shoes and followed any possible outcome stemming from the path of a divineless Christ living life as an ordinary man and susceptible to evil temptations.Indeed, at this point, Nikos may have convinced himself that Jesus was in fact more Divine appearing as man in flesh. If Christ was just a man, then of course he would be tempted by the devil (disguised as the guardian angel -- a little girl) to come down from the cross. But based on biblical facts, Jesus did NOT come down from the cross .. thus was NOT tempted easily by the devil .... and his death was holy.The story is deep. Read the book. You will appreciate the movie even more.THE SOUNDTRACK ..... Peter Gabriel should have been nominated for an Oscar. The soundtrack he composed and produced for this film is REVOLUTIONARY which had influenced countless of other movie/ soundtrack composers. Peter's record label 'Real World' has and continues to release top- notch world music from every coun try. He actually flew-in the musicians (from Turkey, Egypt, Africa, other parts of the Middle-East, and god knows from what other countries) to his Real World Studio in his countryside cottage. Top notch studio. Peter recorded the musicians as well as incorporating his own parts by using synthesizers, samplers, and other modern instruments. The engineering and mixing alone was most challenging in creating those beautiful sound textures. I believe Peter was one of the first to record with digital audio workstation computers known as WAVE, at that time, in addition to recording onto digital multitrack tape machines. In 1987, this was a big deal.I recommend that everyone should buy Peter Gabriel's soundtrack (called ""PASSION"") .... and also to buy it's complimentary CD called ""PASSION SOURCES"" which has world tracks which influenced him to compose Passion. Passion is still the best soundtrack and work of musical art to date. And, have a listen to his soundtrack of the movie BIRDY. Bloody incredible. RICH RICH RICH. Emotional. MOVING.",The Last Temptation of Christ
205,tinar59,A Modern Reading for the Modern Audience,10,7 September 2004,"I watched the film some months ago and I just wanted to say it is on the list of my ""ten tops"". I'm not a Christian (and thus I'm unbiased), I am just a fan of Nikos Kazantzakis for the unique philosophical views depicted in his novels. Anyway, I think Scorsese has done something admirable: he has adapted a thought-provoking literary work for the common movie-goers. That, by itself, is enough to get him into trouble: there's always a difference between those who read and those who watch. Book- readers are much more patient with the revolutionary views. They are more likely to change, because the process of reading gives them time to adjust and re-adjust themselves to the new notions revealed in the book. Just in contrast, a typical movie-goer has little chance to really plunge into the world created by the silver screen. He has virtually no time to re-think what is going on. He may even be manipulated by many other marginal factors such as gossips, falsifying posters, or political-religious controversies over the film. Thus the typical movie-goer goes to watch a film with a certain ""schema"" in his brain. Therefore, his immediate response may be erratic and at odds with the film's optimal objectives. I'm sure most of the protests against this film would be relinquished if all agree that a film is, above all, a work of art, not a platform to advertise religion. What makes a film great is NOT ""what"" it says, but rather ""how"" it says, and I guess Scorsese has been successful in ""how"" he relates the story Even regarding its content, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ is a great film, because it creates some ""modern"" plot out of an ancient theme. I wonder how the ""modern"" audience can complain about a modern reading of Jesus's lifeHe WAS a man after all, wasn't he? And this film is just a film, isn't it?",The Last Temptation of Christ
206,philliefan_00,Highly underrated,10,22 April 2006,"The movie runs a little long and the pace is sometimes tedious, but otherwise Martin Scorsese should be proud of this insightful, intelligent, and moving film, which views like a character sketch of a human Jesus with whom regular people can relate. A lot of those who condemn it for being blasphemous or offensive either have never seen the film or don't seem to have a complete understanding of one of the most basic elements of the Christian faith: that Jesus, while fully divine, was fully human as well, and thus was subject to all of a human's shortcomings. If you believe Jesus was a man, you must believe that he was tempted by power and the flesh, and speculation that he had feelings of self-doubt can't be dismissed by a wave of the hand and a few harsh words for Mr. Scorsese. In many ways, 'Last Temptation' trumps 'The Passion of the Christ' in terms of delivering the staple Christian messages of self-sacrifice, hope and redemption. See it for yourself before condemning it offhand.",The Last Temptation of Christ

The dual substance substance of Christ- the yearning, so human, so superhuman, of man to attain God...... Has always been a deep inscrutable mystery to me.

This may be a strong statement, and it was hard for me to admit it, but that's what it is. For instance, is it Godly to think that Jesus falls into temptation, have sex with Mary Magdalene, have children, repent of sins and die at 80? How could that be. Doesn't the Bible say that Jesus Christ is the Unblemished Lamb - a Lamb without defect who was sacrificed for us sinners, a sinless man for sinful man? (1 Peter 1:19).
I tell you the truth, it is satanic to think that Christ failed to resist temptation. It is satanic to think that Jesus Christ, although He was man on earth, ultimately acted like us in every way and sinned against God.
Again, what can I say? People disagree of course, (for all of God's disciples will be ridiculed), but guess what, the ones who hate God will pay soon, for it is written, ""I will not leave the guilty unpunished"".This film is sick, disgusting, demonic.",The Last Temptation of Christ

210,Gerry-16,A message about humans,10,12 May 2001,"After reading several of the comments on this film I feel obligated to put in my two cents.  There seems to be a penchant for comparing this interpretation of Christ's crucifixion to that of the Bible for the sake of religious comment.  I see how this is possible, yet let's broaden our prospective.This film uses a biblical character to discuss not Jesus necessarily, but the potential of MAN.  If we detach ourselves from what we know about the Bible and Christianity and apply the message to ourselves instead I think we may see and feel what was the intent of the filmmaker.  What I received from this film was a reaffirmation that Jesus' life is a life that we are all leading, full of choices of whether we live as man, as we have come to know him, or choose the high road, the difficult, frightening, painful and ultimately (hopefully) joyous one of living above the confines of our humanness for the SAKE OF EACH OTHER.I know it's rather daring to say that I think we are all the Messiah, all here to spread God's love and all here for each other before ourselves. That is what I believe and I believe the message of this film.  I don't feel it's about religion per se, and those who feel the film is blasphemous may just be unwilling to believe that the power to change the world doesn't lie in a God that already has a plan for us, but rather in ourselves to live life in the highest realm, as God has given us the power to.  Scary, yes, because then we, not God, are to blame if something goes wrong.  But God created this earth for us, not for Himself and I think is much more interested in intention, not outcome.Just my thoughts, you don't have to buy it if you don't want to.

I had heard all of the controversy and all the hype but this film not only strengthened my personal faith, it helped me to understand Jesus's sacrifice even more. Don't at all simply ignore this movie because of any bad things you've heard about it.  Don't judge a book by it's cover, and defiantly don't judge a movie by how many close-minded Christians protest and boycott it. The film doesn't turn Jesus into  a God-like figure, it shows him as a mortal being, struggling and seeking answers. He is fighting with himself, and trying to make sense of what God wants of him, while trying to ignore what he wishes for his life. The movie focuses on him trying to do away with his humanly desires and concentrate on what God wants him to do. Scorsese does an extraordinary job like always, but out of all his films I've seen- this one is his best. The acting was wonderful by the whole cast, although I must say David Bowie was an interesting choice for Pontius Pilate.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves good drama, and to any Christian- it will open up your mind.",The Last Temptation of Christ
213,Dom#1,The film is an absolute masterpiece.,10,29 December 2000,"Without revealing too much about the film, I can say that the main thing, which I see others noticed is how a religious film about Jesus could have such an overpowering effect on me.  The film is quite long yet at no time did I feel myself looking at my watch.  I felt that unlike many other religious films you get on TV around Easter, you can relate to Jesus, and even other characters who are not merely 'plastic' images, but highly complex and understandable.  As well as the film being very spiritual, it is also highly enjoyable with the portrayal of the two sides of Jesus, the divine and the human.  The disgust He feels for Himself, the anger at God, and the temptations of Satan are written and shot beautifully, and as the film moves along to the inevitable crucifixion and 'the last temptation', I was totally drawn into the film and by the end felt very angry with those people who tried to stop the film being made, and those who judged it without seeing it.  I cannot see how the film can be offensive, when it states at the beginning how it is not based upon the Gospels.  This is a film that made me really think about Jesus in such a deep way, more than anyone or thing has before.  I personally gave the film 10/10, as it ranks up there with the Scorsese elite of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull.  A must-see for everyone, religious or not.",The Last Temptation of Christ
214,twistedindie,Its a fine movie- from a Christian,8,9 February 2007,"I am an evangelical Christian and i think this film has received too many uneducated insults. of course this movie is very challenging for me, but i think it is well worth watching.Jesus was all man and all god according to the bible, so if this movie is inaccurate so are the ones that portray Jesus as this somber, melancholy, ""i am Jesus"" . i think that just because there's a sex scene in the movie with Jesus, every Christian thinks its blasphemous. it cracks me up because and the beginning of the movie there is a very clear discalimer saying ""this movie is not based on the biblical gospels"", and taken in the context of the story, the sex scene isn't as terrible as it sounds. as far as i could tell, Jesus never directly sins in the movie. he was tempted throughout the whole story, and there is nothing sinful about being tempted. but, this movie is not by any mean an accurate portrayal of the life of Jesus. it is only an exploration into Jesus as a human(which, again, is cleary stated at the beginning of the film). if you are a Christian, give this movie a chance, and if you are not a Christian, understand that this is only one facet of Jesus' personality.The artistic quality of this film is unbelievable. i don't think anyone who has seen can disagree with me.",The Last Temptation of Christ

Hopefully, future movies on Jesus will further explore his human side and the actual historical events that made his Jewish seperatist sect into the dominant religion that it is today. The scene in which Jesus confronts Paul is great as it shows that it is Paul who made the Christian church breakout from the other competing sects and flourish.

I am a Christian, and when this film was released, I read some awful things about its contents in my church bulletin. My husband finally convinced me to give the movie a shot...and I was deeply moved. Of course, the scenes I had read about were nowhere to be found in the movie. The theology wasn't all correct, but that wasn't the point at all! (Give me free thinking before dogmatism any day.) Defoe was brilliant at depicting the man who painfully learned over time that he was the Messiah. Let's face it - being the Messiah had to be pretty lonely. I have only a few criticisms: Kietel's New York accent was a distraction, the scene with Paul preaching and then confronting Jesus seemed superfluous...maybe it made more sense in the book, and John the Baptist and his followers were probably not so odd.  Several scenes really brought the Gospels to life for me. Jesus at the wedding party was having a grand ol' time dancing and socializing; raising Lazarus from the dead surprised Jesus perhaps more than anyone else; and then there was the tense moment when Jesus was beginning to lead a revolt against Rome in the Temple, but he could not follow through because God did not tell him to proceed. The movie reminded me that Jesus didn't always know what was going to happen - he didn't have the Gospels to read and find out how everything ends. He lived day by day like we do, and, as he said in the movie, God told him a little at a time - as much as he needed to know. Brilliant film, Defoe was never better. Most of the people who hate this film have never seen it (including myself until recently). Please watch this movie.

Jesus is God in human form. He wasn't born into sin like you and i are from Adam. According to the bible Jesus never had a doubt in who he was. that he is the son of God.. God in flesh and blood. Jesus was tempted by the devil but the only time he showed some weakness was when he was on the cross and said, ""My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"" (Matthew 27:46). most believe this was because it was about the time Jesus was about to die and since he had NO SIN at all.. he was able to take in our sins, hence ""died for our sins"".. and God who was always with Jesus (deity), had to leave Jesus because God cant be with sin. so that's why Jesus says that. this movie shows Jesus as a human who is righteous but still sinful, give me a break.. Jesus was in the desert when he was tempted..""The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert, so that the devil could test him. After Jesus had gone without eating for forty days and nights, he was very hungry. Then the devil came to him and said, ""If you are God's Son, tell these stones to turn into bread."" Jesus answered, ""The Scriptures say: 'No one can live only on food. People need every word that God has spoken.' "" (Matthew 4:1-4)that is just one of the many times Jesus was tempted, it shows how strong his faith was.. this movie portrayed him like he was weak. i like a lot of Scorsese movies but as a Christian i take offense to this movie by the way he portrayed Jesus. Scorsese should just stick with gangster movies. if you guys want to learn about Jesus, our savior.. then read the bible instead of some inaccurate mainstream Hollywood crap. plus reading is better for you.and for those of you who think the bible is ""fiction"". then how do you think we got here? big bang? that sounds more ridiculous than anything else. just look at your body outside and inside.. look at your eyes very closely and how the body functions. the body is so sophisticated, even how the earth and the air and how everything comes together for life form. you think a big bang created all this? if you put a bunch of parts from an ipod nano in a box and shake it up for a million years, you think it'll make itself?.. someone would have to put it all together right. the universe and the human body is more complicated than an ipod. we are created by God",The Last Temptation of Christ

Harvey Keitel, who plays a pretty decent-sized part, acted the same as he would in any other role. On the other hand, Willem Dafoe did a great job as playing a Jesus that actually had emotion, fears, and of course temptations. A Jesus that was actually human. I'm not a Christian but I still think that the bible is full of great stories, especially the ones surrounding Jesus. Though in all of the passages I've read or been told, I never really felt I could relate to him. I understand that we aren't exactly supposed to be able to relate to the messiah because he is ""perfect"" and we are not. But the way he is portrayed in this movie does two things to enhance his story. One: it lets the viewer sympathize/empathize with Jesus.

Sheer heart break turning to sheer ecstasy and joy how the many ""men"" in Mary Magdalene's life always walked away, yet not her Jesus. Everything was just so perfect about this movie and fit into place so absolutely well. Controversy or not. Blasphemy or not, this was......a work of beauty and genius. And the Movie Mary Magdalene and Jesus reminds me so much of my 2 friends in our home town.

224,seanpiece,"Not for everyone - remember, this isn't the Bible's version.",10,15 February 2003,"The Last Temptation of Christ is not based on the Bible (well, it is, but you know what I mean ... ) but on Nikos Kazantzakis's fictional adaptation of the life of Joshua of Nazareth, better known as Jesus Christ.  From the get-go, the moviemakers warn the audience that this isn't a familiar look at the lovable messiah, but a glimpse into a soul tortured by the ultimate responsibility.  The aspect of a mortal Christ is one familiar to Christians - he was both man and God at once.  And yet, through the Bible, church sermons, and even other movies he rarely shows doubt, never gives temptation a second thought, and gladly offers his life.  To compare his life to our own is almost blasphemy, but if he was a human, then he experienced what we all do - lust, depression, confusion, regret, and all of the emotions and temptations that come with life.William Dafoe plays a conflicted Jesus, one struggling with what he is and what God wants with him.  Never is the message fully revealed to him - at first he fights with what he is, then he preaches the power of love, then he speaks of baptism the world with fire.  Only at the end does he realize his Father's plan for him to be the sacrifice, but even then he is tempted - the last temptation itself is incredible in it's simplicity.  Dafoe wouldn't suit the archetypical messiah by any means, but that isn't what this movie is about.  Harvey Keitel is one of my favorite actors, and he shines as the apostle Judas.  As a member of the Zealots, Judas wishes to destroy the Romans and waits for the messiah to lead the Jews in military victory over their enemies.  Where Jesus preached love, Judas thought him an idealistic fool.  But he followed him nonetheless, and he is a tremendous counterbalance to Jesus - always sure in his convictions, no matter what they are.One of the most controversial aspects of the film in my opinion is Judas being shown in such a kind light, but opponents of the film focused more on the sections dealing with Jesus's temptations, especially some including Mary Magdaline.  This didn't bother me - if Jesus was a man, then he would have had feelings that all men have.  He would have wanted love, a family, the chance to lead a normal life; of course, leading a normal life was the only thing denied him.This movie was made to raise eyebrows, and apparently succeeded.  I find myself a fairly liberal guy, but even I was surprised at what Scorcese dared to do in his treatment of the Son of God.  It is a humble epic (created at a cost of only seven millions dollars total) with quite a heavy subject.  It certainly is not for everyone.  But one of the apostles (I forget which) and Paul both say something similar within the movie - even if words aren't true, they are important if people believe them.  That's how I feel about Christianity.  What is more compelling; a knowing Lord who comes to us and dies without troubles, or a man from among us who is tortured from within and without and still makes the right decision?So feel free to hate this movie.  Enjoy it.  Tolerate it.  But before you denounce it, see it.  Watch the whole thing without comment, then make your decision at the end.  I liked it, but you certainly don't have to, not when it deals with such a sensitive subject.  Just remember that Jesus was decried by the religious groups of his time, too.  Two thousand years later, we're talking about him, not the Pharisee.",The Last Temptation of Christ

If you've read the novel, you already know that it is not just the last part that is controversial. The role played by Willem DaFoe is nothing like the present-day church displayes Jesus. It should also be noted that Mr.DaFoe does an excellent job in displaying Jesus of Nazareth.The movie can be a bit long and boring, but what can you expect when you already know how it's going to end?So, is it worth spending an evening of your precious time on this movie? If you can use it for some purpose then it's a bad idea, but honestly, if you're looking for some entertainment - as most movie-goers are, you should steer away from this movie.",The Last Temptation of Christ
226,hannibal242,Too Many People See Too Little,10,10 March 2003,"The Last Temptation of Christ was written by Nikos Kazantzakis for his own personal journey of the soul,  in order to better understand his faith. Although many Biblical stories are followed in Last Temptation,  this is not a story about God, Christ, or any figure  directly depicted scripturally. This is not even a philosophy,  religious movement, or cult belief.  This is a way of understanding faith in the true Christian God.  Those of religious background tend to judge too closely based on the bible,  and should separate themselves from that book, and the film/novel. Leave blasphemy behind,  and picture yourself as Christ;  a man,  born of a god,  but still a man. Afraid, confused, but still the son of god.  I myself am not religious,  but the story gave me pause.  The film itself is very well done, and Willem Dafoe's Christ, to me,  was superb,  as is all that he does. I highly recommend this film to those with an open,  intellectual,  and philosophical mind.  For those who are not on that list,  watch some reality television shows.  They should suit you fine.Thank you.",The Last Temptation of Christ

He played Jesus so beautifully and he looked gentle and beautiful too. Everything from the locations, the sets, the costumes, the supporting actors, the music were outstanding. The ending was pure joy, my heart felt so lifted and connected to God. It was bliss.

228,investcon,outrageous? absolutely not for those who seek the truth of love....,10,12 December 2009,"Since the beginning of life ( downfall of man from heaven which is metamorphosed in holy scripts but perfectly storied by Lars Von Trier in his masterpiece movie; Antichrist's prologue have to be watched and matched with this movie to try to understand the truth of life ) ancient and modern day mistics wanted to reveal the truth (Sophos) in mistic words that every men cannot understand because they knew the truth was holy like in Christ's words ''You shall not give the pearls to pigs''. The truth is love, God created the existence to see the real love. Western world is now away from the truth because they did not understand the message. The most shocking dialogue of this movie to me was ''-What if i tell something wrong about God? -God will protect you from doing that and you won't do that..- What if I tell the truth about God?''Every civilization had the truth seekers but non of them could have told the Sophos like Muslim mistics. Before blaming this movie for blasphemy, try to understand what the eastern disciplines are telling. P.S: Jesus was neither God nor son of God but a human being like the other prophets. This does not seem to be an analogy but rather a metaphor which again was not comprehended by Roman world a.k.a Christendom.

231,bstuenkel,I can understand the controversy,10,28 December 2003,"The Last Temptation of Christ has been recommended to me many times over the years as a gripping and provocative film.  I finally watched it recently, and found it to be one of the most shocking films I've ever seen. Now don't take this to be a negative statement...I believe that people need to be shocked every now and then, and a film which takes an un-traditional look at the life of Jesus Christ will do just that. As a movie, I think Scorsese pulled it off staggeringly well.  The acting is right on, with sensational performances by Dafoe and Keitel.  The score is as chaotic as it is ""80's"", but I felt that this added to the film's mystique. As for all of the people who criticize this movie, many of them who haven't even seen it:  Give it a try...if nothing else it will give you something to talk about.

To see this as anything other than what any other humans mind cycles through when facing a difficult decision. Remembering that Jesus WAS human but chose, CHOSE, to sacrifice himself in the name of God?? How much more powerful can you portray and acknowledge the depth of Jesus' love and that of his father in this sacrifice??I stood online to see this movie when it first came out. We were inundated by supposedly religiously minded people who had not seen this movie, saying it was sacrilege. They were fools.To fully understand a sacrifice, I believe it is best to imagine all the ways in which obey could have been tempted.Temptation is not the evil. It is the collapsing and abandonment of principles that is evil.",The Last Temptation of Christ
233,Real_Simple,brilliant,8,9 May 2006,"Having read the book in its original language by Nikos Kazantzakis, and being a great fan of the author, I would say that this is one of his most illuminated works and the director has done a fine job.The basic idea of the book and the film is to search the human side of Jesus, as he was both human and God. This is the most humane Jesus ever. The temptation is the normal life that any one of us has (or tries to at least): a home, a family, a wife, children, love, anger.Kazantzakis was almost excommunicated by the Greek Orthodox Church for this book (as for a series of others too, such as ""Christ Recricified"") because of this very idea. However, I tend to consider Kazantazakis as a person with great faith, due to which he was trying to find the truth.Kazantzakis argues that Jesus, as a human being, would have wanted all that. That is the very temptation. And He lives that in a dream-like situation while on the cross. But at the end, Jesus denies all earthly ""delights"" (in his vision) in order to be crucified and resurrected.Kazantzakis depicts the most human Jesus, hence the most accessible, for many. William Dafoe is just brilliant.",The Last Temptation of Christ

235,flahertyd,"A beautiful, moving film.",10,16 March 2005,"This is a beautiful film. It is one of the most powerful and ultimately one of the greatest films ever made, without a doubt. The performances, especially by Willem Dafoe as Jesus, are amazing; the sets and costumes are realistic and never feel forced, glossy, or stylized (and were based on extensive archaeological and philological research); Peter Gabriel's score is absolutely unbelievable...I cannot possibly praise this film enough, as well as Mr. Scorcese's courage in making such a bold and beautiful work of art in the face of considerable opposition.It is really best to avoid religious and theological arguments about this film - it is simply a portrait of Christ coming to terms with who he is and what he must do. If it occasionally portrays Jesus in a manner that is somewhat at odds with that of scripture, try to keep in mind that it is merely another take on a story that has no absolute and authoritative telling. That Jesus has difficulty coming to terms with the role he must play is something that scripture does not rule out.Consider it this way: this is the sort of film that has the power to convince the irreligious or non-Christians out there (of which I am one) of the importance, beauty, depth, and truth of Jesus' vision of a world filled with love and compassion.

236,djchriskutz,Blasphemes.,3,17 March 2005,"When watching this film, I felt very unnerving. I felt that it was very Blasphemes. As I am a strict Christian I felt that it showed Jesus to be to much of a man and less like the son of God. For one the bible tells us that after Jesus was baptised he the spirit of god with him. The film however shows us that still after Jesus has been baptised he still wants to live like a man. This basically shows that the power of god does not no power over the urges of man which is saying that god isn't that powerful. What people must realise is that even though Jesus was a man he was perfect. If Jesus had all these thoughts then he sinned as Jesus him self said if you think of a sin you have committed it. To think of turning away from god is the worst sin ever; remember people it was for this reason Lucifer got cast out if heaven. This Film also shows Jesus to be a hypocrite as the film shows Jesus going against his own teaching.On a serious note the people who made this film have some serious repenting to do. Instead of making these types of films, people have to start making films telling people about the word of god instead of challenging the word of god. The truth is right there for people it is smacking them in the face; but it is like humans to come up with their stupid Philosophies and go around the truth. People have no fear of god and that is why these types of films are being made. It is only when they are standing before God they will say oh sorry i didn't know!",The Last Temptation of Christ
237,iottj,"""I want to be the Messiah""",8,17 February 2006,"There's plenty that could be said about this movie, both good and bad. I'll concede that Jesus is portrayed as less than ideal--tortured, harsh, overly salesmanlike, maybe even, as someone commented in the forum, ""a bad person."" Certainly the theology isn't orthodox, and I think that most everyone involved in its production would agree. But while the Jesus presented here isn't perfect, he's also, I would argue, far more sympathetic than the wooden Christ of Zeffirelli's film or the bloody pincushion of Mel Gibson's travesty. What Scorcese presents is not a devotional film but an inspirational one in the truest sense of the word: shown Christ's (possible) struggles and triumphs, we are called to follow. In this regard the film's most powerful line is not the traditional ""It is accomplished,"" but the writers' own ""I want to be the Messiah."" It is my firm belief that this film will, despite some uncomfortable passages, gradually be recognized as a masterpiece both of film-making and of devotion. What Jesus willingly gives up is far more powerful than the bloodshed of ""The Passion,"" and what this means is far clearer and more inspiring.(Notably, a number of Christian groups (most prominently the Promise Keepers) have reached a similar understanding of the film. )",The Last Temptation of Christ

Written by Nick Lopez (ntlopez@fas.harvard.edu)""He must face the greatest temptation; the normal life of a good man."" But is it the life of a ""good"" man? The temptation is so powerful because it is presented so attractively. In his fantasy- temptation, the make-believe Jesus sees himself in ripe old age surrounded by many women and children, having fallen for the misogynistic lie ""There is only one woman in the world."": In his imagination, he betrays his pregnant wife Magdalene, the woman who has loved him since girlhood, by simultaneously impregnating Mary of Bethany. He goes on to imagine that he sleeps with her sister Martha in Mary's absence. But most obviously, he is tempted to betray his best friend, his close disciples, his other followers, the trusting crowds of Jerusalem, to turn his back on them, to walk away into a lush Eden-like landscape, to escape and hide. At last, this imaginary life of a ""good"" man is dramatically revealed as a temptation when his guardian ""angel of light"" dissolves in a flare of Satanic flame. So the real Jesus rejects this temptation once he sees through it. He remains to die on the cross.",The Last Temptation of Christ
240,l-07319,Review: The last Temptation of Christ,8,25 May 2015,"The movie: The Last Temptation of Christ was a decent film. While others who reviewed this movie seemed to praise Martin Scorsese, I don't praise him, I simply note he did a good job. While some of his other notable works are much more famous, The Last Temptation of Christ does do the job. The film does have very graphic portrayals of Jesus's life. The scene in which Jesus is crucified is particularly bloody, as well are scenes of stoning and and whipping. However, accurate or not, this does portray the struggles and qualms that Jesus had to deal with and overcome in his life. This could be a subject of controversy for many devout religious Christians, who see him as a divine figure. The film does seem to portray Jesus as a sometimes not brave, and even scared person, who is not ready to accept his fate and duty. Other controversies included Jesus and his life before and even during his days when he has become a Messiah. Jesus is tempted many times throughout the movie; sexually and with other themes of money and greed. While the film, I felt, does do a good job of relating to the Bible, there is a scene towards the end of the book, which I felt could potentially (and later I found out did) offend a lot of people. The scene includes Jesus, dying on the cross, in a state of altered reality, dreaming what his life could have been like had he just lived his normal life. While it portrays his life of raising kids, the particular scene in mind shows and implies him having sex with another lady that was not his wife. I knew this would be a problem, as adultery and abstinence are both huge beliefs in Christian society. I personally felt this was somewhat offensive to Jesus, as he is a major holy figure in the entire religion of Christianity. However, any movie will have to have its extra details, just to add more interest. Overall, the movie was very powerful, and had a lasting image on me. Jesus is viewed as a person who is capable of making mistakes, which I personally liked, due to the fact that we live in a imperfect world. Scorsese does a good job with the character development of Jesus, as he grows from someone who is not ready to accept his fate to someone who embraces it. The movie is not for everyone, especially if you stick closely to the Bible and view Jesus as a perfect man. A great movie, would recommend to people who like Scorsese's other films.",The Last Temptation of Christ
241,NetReverend,It is a beautifully composed Porn film about Jesus,1,12 September 2005,"The summary is of course not my complete opinion about the film. Martin Scorsese is a brilliant filmmaker and I have enjoyed other films he has made. And the formal framework is as brilliant as always. But the theme is not worth the talent of Martin Scorsese. The film presents a delusion of the work of Jesus and uses the current trend in marketing to get the message across: Sex sells.To tell you the truth, I viewed most of it at speed x8, after seeing the scene, where Jesus threatens the peoble throwing stones at Mary Magdalene. That is a complete misunderstanding of the spirit of Jesus, and frankly, I didn't want to see more.We only know what the gospels tell us about Jesus, and what we find in our hearts if we seek him. Lust was not the theme of the work of Jesus. Love was.I can not imagine Jesus sitting and watching Mary Magdalene at work.

242,bensegal58,"Jesus, Scorcese, you killed it",9,9 August 2021,"Scorcese's three-hour epic drama about the life and temptations of Jesus Christ is everything and anything but a religious tale. Jesus Christ (Willem Dafoe) is a slender aryan surrounded by plethoras of middle easterners. The film, more than it adheres to the stories of the Bible and the gospels, represents Jesus not so much as the divine son of God but rather as the individual agent striving for greatness, following that inner voice that cannot be shunned. The Jesus in the Last Temptation of Christ seeks less of God and a divine ending, but is rather pushed forward in hopes of reaching the depths of himself. This sacrilegious take on the life of Christ hits closer to home for us not-so fanatic believers. Belief is a singular quest, though it shared through community for the purposes of security, both emotionally and physically, believing in something is an endeavor the individual embarks on solely.",The Last Temptation of Christ
243,madfrankie40,Most people misread this film completely,8,13 May 2006,"The film is not about a historical figure named Jesus Christ. The film uses the figure and story of Jesus Christ to discuss a number of issues relating to spirituality and materiality. This is why it can have talking snakes etc. It uses the idea of Jesus having to confront his own spirituality as a way of discovering more about what it is to be human, and what it is to sacrifice and be tempted. While issues surrounding Jesus's actual divinity are raised, they are not promulgated as fact. It is a work of imagination, not documentation. In a medieval allegory named Piers Plowman, a ploughman named Piers ends up being identified with Christ ""jousting"" for victory on the cross. Those who consider this film blasphemous must also condemn a large part of Christian inspired writing and art that uses Jesus to discuss a range of material and spiritual issues.To those who say that by thinking of the sins Jesus is committing them, remember that it is not sinful to be tempted, to be given tempting thoughts - as the film clearly indicates is happening. It is only sinful to accept those thoughts, not to struggle against them, as Jesus eventually does.This is a thoughtful film, and you must be prepared to think while watching it. Comparing it to POTC is like comparing Heart of Darkness to Amistad, Hamlet to Titus Andonicus, or Beethoven's Eroica to Tchaikovsky's 1812.",The Last Temptation of Christ
