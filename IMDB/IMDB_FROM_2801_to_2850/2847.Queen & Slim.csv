0,SnoopyStyle,bad date blues,6,18 May 2020,"Slim (Daniel Kaluuya) and defense lawyer Queen (Jodie Turner-Smith) are having their first date. It doesn't go that well. It goes even worst when they are stopped by an aggressive cop. The night turns them into fugitives from the law.I want to like this movie. I want to love this world. I just don't like this couple together. It doesn't help that they start off poorly. I don't buy them fighting for each other. Quite frankly, Slim should be hands up and saying that it was all an accident. He shouldn't care about Queen. If they actually got along, Slim may be coming to her rescue but I don't buy this. I do understand the premise that they grow closer together from the incident but chances are better that they split up and go their separate ways. The whole story would work much better if their date is the best first date ever.",Queen & Slim
1,nogodnomasters,Let Them Go.,8,4 January 2020,"Queen (Jodie Turner-Smith) finally goes on a date with Slim (Daniel Kaluuya). They are involved in an altercation where Slim shoots a policeman in self-defense. On the advice of his attorney, Queen, he absconds from the scene and goes on the run. The video is all over the media as the two become cult icons with folks willing to help them along the way.It was an interesting film showing how society reacts or overreacts to incidences. I liked the characters, not fond of the ending.When a bunch of people with guns locked on you tells you to ""get down now"" you get down on the ground and argue facts later. Same as if the ATF shows up at your compound with a tank at your door and orders you to come out. You come out and argue right and wrong later. This is why God created civil law suits. If you don't obey, I would argue God doesn't want you in the gene pool.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Jodie Turner-Smith )",Queen & Slim
2,kosmasp,(not) how to survive(?),8,3 April 2020,"Okay so first things first. There is the inciting inceident and the reaction to it. If you've read at least the synopsis, you know this is not about a dating app and you know what the two main characters do and how they react to it. Even if you've read that, depending on your background you might be at least annoyed by how the think they should react.Now if you can't overcome that initial reaction of despise, you'll have a problem with the movie overall. So suspend your disbelief if you can and you'll have a movie filled with tension and unease. While I disagree wholeheartedly with their reaction and their thinking of how to ""get out"" of their predicament (no pun intended), it makes sense in the reality of the movie and the reality of the characters.Having said that, there is a road movie ahead that has many things. Not always answers and not always feel good vibes to say the least. It will be up to the viewer to decipher what they'll take from it. How they will view a weird and long intercourse scene during something horrible that happens at the same time. At least if you believe the editing that takes place ... This is uncomfortable and this may be necessary viewing for some ...",Queen & Slim
3,BA_Harrison,A farcical fugitive film.,5,3 December 2019,"A Tinder date goes awry when Angela and Ernest (striking beauty Jodie Turner-Smith and Get Out's Daniel Kaluuya) are pulled over by a racist cop and wind up shooting him in self-defence. Realising they're in deep trouble, the couple go on the run, making a desperate bid for Florida, and then Cuba, before they are apprehended by the law.African American drama Queen & Slim would have us all believe that the bond between black people is so strong that they will happily harbour fugitives from the law simply because they share the same skin colour (reward money be damned). Hell, even a black police officer is willing to risk his career to allow the armed-and-dangerous couple to slip away unnoticed, even though they're wanted for cop-killing. To be honest, it borders on the farcical at times. Still, no wonder Angela and Ernest (they're never actually called Queen and Slim in the film) blindly trust the decidedly dodgy looking guy with the gold teeth at the end; he's black as well, so based on previous experience he should be on the level too, right? Or maybe, just maybe, he's the exception that proves the rule.The script for this black Thelma & Louise/Bonnie & Clyde fugitive flick is chock full of hard-to-swallow happenings, the couple making stops on their flight to freedom to partake in a burger, have a dance, ride a horse, visit a cemetery, make love, recklessly leap from a high window (as opposed to lowering themselves as far as possible and then letting go), hand their only firearm to a flaky looking gas station attendant, and lean out of the car window as they drive along (not the most inconspicuous behaviour for people on the lam!). Somehow they evade capture the whole way, even popping in at a service garage to have the radiator on their car fixed (luckily for them, the establishment is owned by yet another black man unwilling to inform the law).As the couple continue their journey, they become folk heroes for the African American community, who rise up against police brutality and racism, which results in the film's most unlikely moment: a young black lad (the mechanic's son) joins a protest and shoots a black policeman in the face for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Still, it's no more perplexing than the many poor decisions made by Angela and Ernest, the last of which costs them their lives.It might sound like I'm being unjustly harsh on this film, but I wanted to like Queen & Slim a lot more, I really did. It looks great and both lead actors put in solid performances, but the script requires much 'tightening up' for it to work, not least because, in it's present state, the film runs at a way-too-long 131 minutes.4.5/10, rounded up to 5 for IMDb. It had bags of potential, but the flaws are many.",Queen & Slim
4,zardoz-13,BONNIE & CLYDE CRIME COUPLE MOVIE,9,13 December 2019,"Beyoncé's ""Formation"" music video director Melina Matsoukas makes her cinematic debut with ""Queen and Slim,"" a fugitive, road-trip, romance that resembles the 1967 crime couple biography ""Bonnie & Clyde."" One of the supporting characters, Bokeem Woodbine's Uncle Earl, compares Angela Johnson (Jodie Turner-Smith of ""The Neon Demon"") and Ernest Hines (Daniel Kaluuya of ""Kick-Ass 2"") with the notorious, Depression-era, Texas bank robbers Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow who went out in a hail of gunfire. Mind you, neither Angela nor Ernest are anything like Bonnie and Clyde. They aren't career criminals living on the fringe. A cruel twist of fate launches them into the sudden cultural limelight of the mass media which grants them immediate celebrity status. Primarily, they share a similar tragic fate like Bonnie and Clyde, but this African American couple acquired their infamy as a consequence of coincidence rather than conscious decision-making. A spur of the moment tragedy transforms them irreparably and simultaneously dooms them! This gritty law and order social melodrama about the dire events which follow a once-in-a-lifetime first date is amusing, exciting, suspenseful, but ultimately heartbreaking. Matsoukas and her writers have obviously seen director George Tillman Jr.'s ""The Hate U Give,"" but they stage a considerably different version of the shooting scene in that film. If you've seen the ""Queen and Slim"" trailer, you'll know what prompted a trigger-happy police officer to set into motion a chain reaction that would end with their bid to catch a plane for Cuba.Ernest has always wanted to date Angelo since he first saw her. Angelo either ignored this Costco employee or brushed him off. Eventually, she invites him to join her at a restaurant, something like a 1980's Shoney's Restaurant with rows of booths. Naturally, Angelo's offer floors Ernest. The conversation gets around to what prompted their date. Ernest expects to hear something flirtatious. Instead, Angelo explains she is an 'excellent' attorney. Nevertheless, she couldn't prevent her client from receiving a death sentence. The verdict still appalls Angelo. She knows from her trial experience that African American men are an endangered species. They constitute an oppressed minority who enjoy none of the wealth, prestige, and esteem of society. Of course, the racially skewed scales of justice embitter Angelo. Clearly, she drew on her considerable knowledge for the best self-defense she could provide her client. Unfortunately, she lost. Finally, she reveals she didn't feel like being alone, so she rang up Ernest. Despite her confrontational, in-your-face, anti-Black rant, Angelo feels frustrated, but she isn't looking for sexual healing. Ernest tries to touch her. When he takes a hand off the steering wheel, his car swerves momentarily. No sooner has this instant elapsed than a police cruiser lights up behind them, and Ernest cruises to the curb.The suspicious white police officer is a stereotypical bully who deliberately goads his suspects. The more reasonable that Ernest struggles to be, the more unreasonable the cop is. Meantime, Angelo steps from the passenger side of the car and makes insistent confrontational demands of the policeman. As her demands intensify, the cop turns and shoots her in the thigh. A free-for-all brawl ensues. Incredibly, Ernest disarms the cop, recovers the gun, and then shoots the cop dead on the spot. The fate of Ernest and Angelo is sealed from the moment that Ernest pulled the trigger. The dashboard camera in the police cruiser has immortalized the whole incident on video. Later, the video goes viral. Wounded as she is, Angelo refuses to let Ernest surrender himself to the authorities. She advises him to hit the road. She pitches his cell phone and prevents him from calling his parents, so the authorities won't arrest the parents for aiding and abetting. They clear out of Cleveland, Ohio, and drive south to New Orleans. As paranoid as they are, Ernest and Angelo wind up parking alongside the highway when they realize they've run out of gas. They hitch a ride to a 24-hour convenience store with a good Samaritan before they realize he is an off-duty sheriff's deputy. He pulls up at the pumps and enters the store to buy them a gas can and fill it up. While inside, he watches in horror the video of the shooting.Ernest and Angelo get the drop of this deputy. They lock him in the trunk of their car and take his truck. He is the only white cop who tries to reason with them, but Angelo insists they are beyond reason. She takes Ernest to New Orleans to see her Uncle Earl (Bokeem Woodbine of ""Caught Up""), and they come up with a plan to escape to Cuba. Uncle Earl gets them a different car and sends them to people that they can trust, whether white or black. Along the way, Angelo gets sentimental, and they use their car for a bedroom and commit to each other. They discover along the way that they have become symbols in a violently racist society. Customers at a nightclub applaud them as folk heroes, and a black teen asserts himself in the face of a black policeman at a riot and murders him in a burst of rage. Ernest and Angelo assume a larger-than-life presence that overshadows them. Sadly, each day brings them closer to destiny.Our woebegone protagonists are sympathetic, particularly Daniel Kaluuya as the laid-back Ernest, while Angela behaves like mama justice, counseling Ernest every step of the way. Ironically, nobody in ""Queen and Slim"" is named either 'Queen' or 'Slim.' Meantime, watching Ernest and Angela circle each other is a lot of fun. Freshman scenarist Len Waithe and ""A Million Little Pieces"" scribe James Frey, who provided the story, pull no punches in this grim but memorable outing that suffers marginally from its long, drawn-out running time of 132 minutes. ""Queen and Slim"" emerges as a message picture without a shred of subtlety about the immorality of racial intolerance. The final ten minutes of the action is unforgettable.",Queen & Slim
5,oscaralbert,America's pre-eminent House of Horror--Universal--courageously tackles . . .,9,3 December 2019,". . . perhaps its most fearsome beast ever with QUEEN & SLIM: The Cleveland, OH, P.D. This flick portrays the CPD as more frightful than Universal's Dracula, Mummy, Wolfman and Frankenstein monsters all rolled into one. This treatment will ring totally True to anyone who's ever been to Cleveland, or who is the least bit up-to-date with Current Events. The CPD is infamous for allowing serial killers to molest Harems of Color in their homes for decades at a time, and for gunning down Minority Kids on playgrounds with no warning upon their slightest whims. Colin K. has taken the NFL down a notch or two by protesting--in large part--the heinous CPD, and EVERY U.S. citizen now has to think twice about becoming an ""ethnic cleansing"" enabler (or, at the very least, endorser) by profaning Freedom through Kow-Towing to the so-called ""National Anthem"" (check out the ultra-racist verses #2, 3, & 4, which detail the Key Family Human Trafficking Crimes). QUEEN & SLIM shows how the entire current crop of U.S. cops are in cahoots with each other, and ALL of them must be deported to Siberia ASAP for their tolerance of and participation in Crimes against Humanity!",Queen & Slim
6,view_and_review,"Good, Even if it was a Bait and Switch",7,30 November 2019,"Queen & Slim started off as an intense drama that had me on the edge of my seat. Once the movie settled into the meat and potatoes it was no longer as intense and it was no longer a gripping drama, it was a romance.All indications from the trailers and from the beginning of the movie made it quite obviously that it was about a Black man and a Black woman who'd just accidentally killed a Cleveland cop and their frenetic actions afterwards. Somewhere during the movie the primary issue became secondary if not tertiary as the budding relationship between them took center stage. I didn't have a problem with that necessarily, but I do think the air was let out of the sails.As they made their cross-country trek to Florida so that they could make an Assata Shakur-style escape to Cuba they began to be less and less cautious, and less and less concerned about being caught. Each little romantic side excursion they took signaled to me as a viewer that it was no longer about escaping, it was now about creating a loving relationship. Once that was clearly the focus, I myself no longer had the same vested interest in their escape. Their escaping was a secondary concern to me as much as it seemed to be to them.The contrast could not have been clearer than when they were having sex in the car while a protest was going on presumably in their name. Whereas the people saw two worthy individuals to galvanize them, those two people only saw each other. What was or wasn't happening around them was background noise as they began to act only for each other.So, the end, which could be viewed as tragic to some, seemed inevitable to me. They died as a heroic couple when they were anything but, they were just a couple in circumstances that compressed them together as one. This is not to say that heroes can't be born from acting reflexively, it's more of a question of who deserves to be a hero. So, while their death was poetic and certainly romantic, I never saw it as heroic because they changed nothing.Their death brought about no changes whatsoever. The only thing that altered from the moment they shot a cop until the moment they were gunned down was that they were lovers. No truths were revealed because whoever saw the dashcam video believed about it what they wanted to believe. There were no heroes created by their action, the only actor inspired by them was a boy who shot a cop in the face.Yes, they were two compelling characters, especially Queen (Jodie Turner-Smith). Yes, something occurred the fateful night they met and yes, they went on a journey together. But, no, nothing changed by the time they were slain on the tarmac.I don't want you to think that I didn't enjoy the movie because I did. This was an enjoyable movie. I enjoyed the performances by Jodie Turner-Smith and Daniel Kaluuya. I enjoyed the movie in general and the social dynamic it addressed. It was a good movie even if I felt it was a little bit of a bait and switch.",Queen & Slim
7,evanston_dad,Works Well If Not Picked Apart,8,13 July 2020,"""Queen & Slim"" is I think the perfect example of a movie that's greater than the sum of its parts.There are many individual moments in the film that don't hold up under scrutiny. But when experienced as a whole, the film exerts a kind of poetic power. It's equal parts sorrow and rage at the treatment of African Americans in the United States, and having watched it after the George Floyd murder (even though the film came out before it), it's impossible not to understand the actions and motivations of the Bonnie and Clyde couple at the film's center.It's certainly overheated and histrionic at times, but these are overheated and histrionic moments we're experiencing in our country right now, and I don't want movies, especially movies about race, to play it safe. I want them to be angry, to scream and shout and swear, to have muscle and teeth, and so the energy blazing off the screen from this movie felt right for the moment.My favorite scene is the one where Slim comments on how beautiful the countryside of rural America is as they're driving through it, and Queen, who casually glances at a prison work gang in a field made up of all black men that could easily pass for a group of field slaves from the Civil War-era South, replies, ""Is it?""Grade: A-",Queen & Slim
8,deloudelouvain,"A movie about a big problem in the USA, the law enforcement and their racist cowboys.",8,1 September 2020,"This movie represents exactly what I think about the American law enforcement, a bunch of trigger happy white supremacists that think they are above the law instead of doing their job correctly. They swore an oath to serve and protect ALL citizens regardless the color of your skin, regardless your status in society, but that's not what they're known for. They're not all like that, that's for sure, but there are way much more bad apples than in any other world country. Their recruiting system should be completely rethought of as there is clearly a big problem. If I were a colored policeman in the USA I would be deeply ashamed of doing that job because in a way you condone that unacceptable behavior of those bad apples. The police shouldn't be our enemy if they would do their job correctly, we shouldn't be afraid of people that want to serve and protect but the truth is completely different if you're not from a certain white upper class. That said it's ironic this movie came out before the events we all know about now (George Floyd and all the others), and it doesn't seem to have any effect on the whole judicial system in the USA. Police brutality towards minorities happen over and over again and the white upper class couldn't give a toss. The fact all those incidents and murders are barely punished proves there is an unwillingness to solve this problem, to eradicate this kind of foul behavior once and for all. Queen & Slim is an entertaining movie, well made and of high quality of cinematography. The acting is on top, certainly from the two lead actors Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith. Since the superb movie Get Out I'm a fan of Daniel Kaluuya, he's a great actor, certainly in roles where he's oppressed. Even if the subject is quite heavy the movie is easy to watch, the growing romance between the two protagonists contributes to that. Queen & Slim, a modern movie about a problem that needs to be dealt with urgently before it gets completely out of hand.",Queen & Slim
9,FeastMode,well-made and emotionally powerful,7,18 March 2020,"Really good movie with great acting. this movie is filled with suspenseful moments, but it also takes its time. you become fully invested in the characters. and there are so many powerful moments. and the best part is, the movie had more going for it than just the social justice message, which was great. but so many movies like this revolve solely around the message, as opposed to having an intriguing story and great characters like this one did. the social justice message was one of the themes, but the movie was about the two characters and their experience. i enjoyed it very much (1 viewing, 3/17/2020)
SPOILERS
the end of this movie had me in tears. like a lot of em. with my emotional investment in the characters, it basically broke my heart. if i had a list of most tears in a movie, this would probably be top 5. i sympathize with anyone that has to go through anything like this. it's a travesty, and i hope we reach some semblance of equality and civility",Queen & Slim
10,Pjtaylor-96-138044,It was the best Tinder date; it was the worst Tinder date.,8,1 February 2020,"'Queen & Slim (2019)' is especially fantastic for a feature film directorial debut, a confident and compelling odyssey across America. At its heart are two powerhouse performances, with Kaluuya in particular proving he deserves to be considered among the contemporary greats. Their characters evolve believably over the course of the narrative, their dynamic shifting wonderfully from recent strangers to straight-up soul mates. You fully buy into their relationship, which never feels fake or forced at any point. The flick is both an on-the-run thriller and an unconventional romance. It's also a relevant, socially-conscious experience that examines the political ramifications of personal actions. Each aspect is as successful as the next; the overall affair is urgent, engaging and affecting. Its tragedy really is profound. Yet, it balances its tone perfectly, often being as funny as it is devastating. It also does a great job with its suspense sequences, crafting a palpable tension often with the most barebones of build-ups. Its only real flaw is its length, which you start to feel as it approaches its final third. Still, it's never slow, per se, and its journey feels big enough to warrant the time spent with it. Its more meditative moments are some of its most important, too. Generally, the movie is brilliant. It's thrilling, gripping, moving and exciting. It's a real highlight of the year thus far. 8/10",Queen & Slim
11,ThomasDrufke,"""Thank you for this journey""",7,16 December 2019,"Divisive, controversial, and thought provoking, Queen & Slim is exactly the type of movie that people who complain about the lack of originality in Hollywood need to see. And for the most part, the movie succeeds at being an immersive crime thriller that never quite stops to take a full breath without rushing you back into more conflict. There are however, specific directing choices that I thought were completely unnecessary and almost repulsive, because the message that was trying to be conveyed was already there in subtext. For some people that style may work, for others Queen & Slim may be too controversial. It's the type of film that I appreciate the craft more than I actually like the movie itself. But it should be seen nonetheless.7.0/10",Queen & Slim
12,Cineanalyst,On the Road Against Racism & Police Brutality,7,2 February 2021,"""Bonnie and Clyde"" (1967), framed as Depression-era rebellion against economic inequality, and ""Thelma & Louise"" (1991), replacing that with a feminist buddy saga, are the two prominent archetypes for ""Queen & Slim,"" which features an African-American duo instead of white characters and the issues of racially-biased police brutality, although one could cite other road trip films of a couple on the run from the violent law--even ""Easy Rider"" (1969), coming from the same late-60s period as ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" but also an independent production with a contemporary counterculture setting. It's a strong foundation, and the formula continues to work well in Melina Matsoukas's 21st-century treatment.Even the controversial crosscutting between a sex scene and a riot aside, there's a naturally effective tension-filled pacing to the premise of a romance on the run from the law, with the stakes raised further by their alleged crime being from fighting back against perceived injustice and the outlaws' subsequent acclaim in their community and cause célèbre otherwise amidst media coverage and a nationwide police manhunt. Although the initial incident takes place in Ohio, the tour like the aforementioned films is across the South of the United States--both reflecting the national problems of race and police issues and focusing on the particular history and reputation of such heightened violence in that region of the country.It's also interesting to note how, for better or worse, how the picture goes to considerable lengths to present balanced perspectives on its social commentary. Indeed, it begins by framing the killing of a racist cop as self-defense after he shoots ""Queen"" (Jodie Turner-Smith) and threatens the life of ""Slim"" (Daniel Kaluuya), but other officers try to be helpful and de-escalate violent situations. Similar divisions are seen in the communities at large, as the couple are celebrated by most other black characters they come across, including one they hit with their car, but are chided by a mechanic, who nonetheless repairs their vehicle at price, and are betrayed by another man who pretends to be their friend. Likewise, they appear to be reported on by one white neighbor but are also hidden from the police by a white couple. I could understand arguments that this balancing act both presents a nuanced, multi-perspective of complicated issues and that it's overly accommodates the perspectives of the movie's audience, thus appearing cautious in this respect, for what is otherwise a strong statement and drama on hot-button issues.Regardless, the romance is an effective journey in itself, from the worst first date ever, as brought to you by Tinder, to the gradual love between two characters who appear not to like each other much at all at first. They, too, also reflect divisions on the racial and policing issues, or at least how to respond to the injustices. And I appreciate how their love first becomes clear in the photograph. It's apt, as well, given that this is a well-photographed picture overall. And as with any emancipating road trip, music is also important.",Queen & Slim
13,slightlymad22,Hits The Ground Running & Does Not Let Up,7,4 February 2020,"I just got out of Queen & SlimI enjoyed it!! This movie hits the ground running and for the first hour, does not let up, it is really intense. It loses its momentum in the middle part, but it picks up again for the ending. I hated what happened in the protest scene, and truthfully that scene could have been taken out, and the movie would not have been any worse for it.Daniel Kaluuya is excellent as is Jodie Turner-Smith, funny thing though I don't think there names are ever said, let alone them being called Queen & SlimI liked Kaluuya's character, he was really relatable and likeable!! Turner-Smith less so, she was annoying and a bit of a hard work diva/princess, especially early on befor you found some things out about her past.I'm not surprised it is leaving my cinema after one week as there was only 1 other person in my screening, and annoyingly he spent most of the time on his phone. A shame as this movie deserved to find an audience.",Queen & Slim

15,Thanos_Alfie,Amazing...,7,16 June 2021,"""Queen & Slim"" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch a couple going on their first date and when they return a police officer pulls them over. Something that will change their lives forever and also their relationship since it will be tested very hard.I liked this movie very much because it had a very interesting plot consisted of some plot twists that I did not think of and they were not predictable. The interpretations of both Jodie Turner-Smith who played as Queen and Daniel Kaluuya who played as Slim were simply outstanding they both did an excellent job. The direction which was made by Melina Matsoukas it was very good and she presented very well her main characters along with their history, their dreams and their beliefs, something that made us better understand them and relate to them. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Queen & Slim"" is an interesting movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure you will enjoy it and that it will leave you speechless.",Queen & Slim
16,cruise01,Decent thriller.,6,4 March 2020,"Queen and Slim (3 out of 5 stars).Queen and Slim is a decent romantic crime drama film. About two mismatched tinder dates Slim (Daniel Kaluuya) and Queen (Jodie Turner-Smith). Having their dinner at a diner. Annoyed with each other. Slim is a straight and down to earth kind of guy. Who wants to obey the law and never take anything for granted. While Queen is an attorney, judgmental, and has an attitude when things are wrong. When they both get pulled over by a cop. The officer aggressively trying to escalate the situation. And pulled a gun on Slim for no reason. And Slim defends himself and accidently killing the officer. They both go on the run from the law enforcements. Trying to lay low and escape to Cuba.It is a very artistic direction with its music score. Sadly, the film does run a little too long and slows down in the second act of the movie. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith performances are great. The films plot is okay and focusing on the issue with racism, stereotyping, and prejudice.Overall, it is a fair film. Decent plot, and direction. good performances. But slow direction and pacing.",Queen & Slim
17,eddie_baggins,A unique take on the road trip/crime genre,7,12 March 2020,"While it would be quick and easy to compare Queen and Slim to an African American version of Bonnie and Clyde, looking a little deeper you can see that Melina Matsoukas's heartfelt film is its very own kind of unique beast.A much more quiet affair than the aforementioned classic, Slim doesn't have the shootouts and spectacle of the 1967 film but still has the power, as Matsoukas adapts actress and writer Lena Waithe's topical screenplay for the big screen.Inspired by the United States current climate of racial tensions and injustice's committed against its black communities through misguided law enforcement, Slim is a powerful examination of black lives in today's world, as we follow Daniel Kaluuya's Slim and Jodie Turner-Smith's Queen, as their Tinder date takes an unexpected turn when they find themselves on the run after an altercation with a white police officer.It's the type of plotline that could be ripped straight from a recent newspaper headline and that's where the majority of Matsoukas's film comes from, as it draws parallels and comparisons to real life occurrences that shouldn't be happening, but most certainly are.It's the type of independent film we don't get to see a lot of in a grand scale, a $17 million budgeted offering that doesn't make for light entertainment but entertainment that makes one pause and consider in matters that deserve our attention.Front and centre to this relevant affair is the standout performances of Kaluuya and Turner-Smith, who do wonders with characters that aren't instantly likeable or overly easy to warm to, but thanks too their on screen chemistry and inhabiting of their respective roles, Slim and Queen make for memorable centrepieces to a film that at times strays a little too far into the unbelievable to always work and engage.Without heading into spoiler territory, there are numerous occasions throughout the on the lamb road trip of these two forced fugitives that don't always ring true. From character decisions, suspect motivations and the sometimes too on the nose dialogue choices halt the film in its tracks.When moments of rawness and vulnerability strike forth, particular latter scenes between Queen and Slim as they open up further to each other and progress in their relationship, the film soars but in its current end product, the film remains engaging without ever forming into the true classic it potentially could've been.Final Say -Queen and Slim walks its own path and dances to its own beat but despite some topical subject matter at its core and the great double act of Kaluuya and Turner-Smith, Matsoukas's film doesn't always ring as true as it should've.3 ½ Red Hot Chilli Pepper band members out of 5",Queen & Slim
18,marmar-69780,queen and slim,4,18 December 2019,"Queen and slim is fine film with real life problem that this potrayed million times in media and films and after some times that becomes tiresome and for me it did,i still found some enjoyment in it,but not as much i was hoping to get , also i think that films with afroamerican cast should consider to make something different in this style of filmaking and not repeating itself over and over again with the same story that was already talled in far better films,but if you like cast and film theme spend money on it and you will you see did you spend it on right thing or wasted it",Queen & Slim
19,paul-allaer,Road movie and relationship drama with social undercurrent,7,30 November 2019,"As ""Queen & Slim"" (2019 release; 132 min.) opens, we get to know these two characters, as they are on their first dinner date in Cleveland. Afterwards, they get pulled over by a blatantly racist cop. The tension mounts and when the cop shoots Queen, Slims dives into the cop and in the ensuing struggle, shoots and kills the cop.Terrified by what has happened, they decide to takeoff and drive to New Orleans, where Queen's uncle lives... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you will just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the feature length debut of director Melina Matsoukas, well known for her many music videos (Beyoncé, Jay Z). Here she brings the courtship of Queen and Slim In the form of a road movie, pure and simple. After the initial shock of the opening 10 minutes, the movie takes a decidedly different tone as this is more about the budding relationship between these two then it is about excessive police force against unarmed African Americans. In that sense, the movie's trailer is a bit misleading as that clearly emphasized the racial tensions and related social issues. The other issue I have is that at two hours and a quarter hour, the movie is just too long for its own good. A tighter edit could've trimmed 15 to 20 minutes without the movie losing any of its essence. Daniel Kaluuya as Slim and newcomer Jodie Turner-Smith as Queen are terrific in the lead roles. Keep your eye out for a short (less than 5 minutes) appearance by Chloë Savigny and an almost unrecognizable Flea as her husband.""Queen & Slim"" Open wide on Thanksgiving weekend. The Thanksgiving day matinee screening where I saw this at was attended dismally (two people including myself), which quite surprised me. If you have any Interest In seeing a road movie of a very different kind, with strong romantic and social undercurrent, I readily suggest you check this out, be at in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD and Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Queen & Slim
20,subxerogravity,Movie does it's job in getting the conversation started but I've seen a lot of movies do this.,10,28 November 2019,"This was a hard one. I have seen this movie before. In fact Tyrese Gibson stared in both the times I've seen this movie before. This movie seems to be more sophisticated in delivering the message of police brutality towards blacks, but not necessarily better with its delivery.
Maybe a little jaded from seeing this particular story again. Black and Blue (with Tyrese)did a similar story earlier this year and it was not as well put together but gave me the same feeling, but I would rather watch that version of this story.",Queen & Slim
21,jtindahouse,Can't manage to maintain the momentum after an amazing opening,7,12 June 2020,"With the current climate around the world at the moment regarding the George Floyd protests, now seemed like as good a time as any to finally check out 'Queen and Slim'. The opening to this movie is incredible. We meet the characters in a diner, get to know them a little, and then an event takes place after they are pulled over by the police. This entire sequence is exquisite. It's tense, unpredictable and powerful. At this point I thought I was in for a masterpiece of a film. Unfortunately it wasn't able to maintain that momentum and fell apart a little later on, but the film is worthing watching for that opening alone.Another aspect of the film I loved was the feeling that anything could happen. Nothing felt off the cards in this movie. It could end in any fashion whatsoever across the full range of the spectrum. I love it when films have that going for it. Where this film lets itself is that it becomes a love story and I just didn't buy it for a second. These were two pretty horrendous people who clearly drove each other reasonably crazy, and the film even goes out of its way to show us this, and yet we are supposed to believe that they are the love of each other's lives? No sale on that one sorry.The film raises a lot of moral debates. Should people who kill police officers be treated as heroes? Is it okay to resist arrest if you don't think the arrest is justified? Is it okay to then go out and rob and steal, simply because you are on the run? Is it okay to treat people who are trying to help you very rudely? People could debate these things for decades to come, and it likely won't be the friendliest of debates which is why I have no interest in partaking in them, but the fact is the movie provides those talking points for people to have. 'Queen and Slim' is a very well made film, that just goes off the rails a little in terms of its characters likability and believability, particularly in the second half. I'd say it is worth a watch, but don't get your hopes up too high after that amazing opening.",Queen & Slim
22,Turfseer,Engaging suspense thriller devolves into unfortunate race-based agitprop,4,12 December 2019,"It got under First time feature director Melina Matsoukas's skin that some critics compared her Queen & Slim to Bonnie & Clyde, despite the fact that one of her characters in the film likens her on the lam protagonists to the notorious 30s bank robbers. Matsoukas was peeved precisely because her Queen & Slim ""heroes"" were innocent victims in contrast to the amoral depression era criminals who suddenly earned (obviously unwarranted) folk hero status following the release of Arthur Penn's classic film in 1967.
Nonetheless Matsoukas was probably justified in her anger over such a specious comparison. Instead, Queen & Slim are characters much more akin to Thelma & Louise, the on the lam duo from another classic film (this time from 1991) who acted in self-defense. Indeed, the idea of an innocent person or persons, falsely accused and on the run, can be the stuff of great suspense and compelling drama.
It begins with a Tinder blind date between Ernest ""Slim"" Hines (Daniel Kaluuya) and Angela ""Queen"" Johnson (Jodie Turner-Smith), an African-American couple who have little in common (Queen is a sassy lawyer and Slim a regular salt-of-the-earth guy). Slim is making no headway in the romance department with Queen until they're interrupted by a Caucasian officer of the law who stops them on the false pretext of a second of erratic driving. Before you know it, the psycho cop shoots Queen (she suffers a graze wound to the leg) with Slim grabbing the cop's gun and shooting and killing him in self-defense.
Eventually we'll discover that Matsoukas and Waithe are advancing the thesis that the officer depicted here is actually representative of most officers, who they maintain are both racists and psychopaths. A cursory glance at many of these white cop versus African-American encounters however, reveals that they aren't so always ""black and white."" Usually it's more like overly jumpy cops mistaking a cell phone for a gun, resulting in tragedy.
Before it becomes clear that the film's scenarists are trying to make a big statement about racism, I was quite willing to accept their psycho racist cop as possibly a ""bad apple."" Indeed their depiction of him is quite scary and realistic and I am quite willing to concede there might be a few of these ""bad apples"" out there.
But I wasn't convinced at all by what happens next by a longshot. Indeed Queen, the supposedly ""smart"" attorney, decides that she and Slim should go on the lam and not immediately turn themselves in to the authorities. Their reasoning is that no one will believe a black person who has just killed a cop. Queen (perhaps caught in a time warp) decides to channel Assata Shakur (aka Joanne Chesimard); it's her idea that she and Slim should flee to Cuba (when was the last time that happened? Probably 1979, given the completely different political climate).
And does it really make sense that Queen would resort to such a ludicrous plan of driving all the way from Ohio to Florida, in the hope that they'll be able to secure a safe flight to Cuba? What's more, within a day or so, dash cam footage has been broadcast all over the US depicting Queen and Slim having acted in self-defense. And not only that, they've become folk heroes in the black community as evidenced by all the people who appear to recognize them (and hold them up as heroes). So why wouldn't they turn themselves in?
For a while, Queen & Slim proceeds like a Hitchcock suspense thriller. There's quite a bit of suspense when they escape from the sheriff and lock him in the trunk and then show up at Queen's uncle Earl's house in New Orleans. Earl, a pimp, is perhaps the best character here (played by an excellent Bokeem Woodbine). But the backstory of him and Queen also doesn't ring true.
The whole idea that Earl murdered Queen's mother and she ended up defending him in a court of law hardly seems realistic. Despite all of Queen's sassiness, Matsouka's ultimate strategy is to present Queen as a veritable saint-that's why she has created this unlikely backstory of Queen defending her uncle. The whole scenario also doesn't ring true because the first place the cops would be looking for Queen is at her uncle's place (after all, she probably would have gotten a great deal of publicity in the past for defending an uncle who murdered her mother!).
Slim also is afforded saintly status by emphasizing his religious nature (he has license plate that reads ""TrustinGod""). And he's so good and trusting that he gives the gun-obsessed hillbilly his firearm in exchange for the gas money (while the hillbilly ludicrously marvels at the gun and gives it back to him, instead of holding him at gunpoint until the police arrive).
Matsoukas completely loses it when she ridiculously juxtaposes a scene of Queen & Slim's lovemaking with a protest over their unjust treatment. And when Junior, the mechanic's son, shoots the good black cop, the suggestion is that police racism is so all-encompassing, it will even drive impressionable black youth to turn on their own.
Queen & Slim are essentially ""crucified"" in the grand finale when the police gun the two ""saints"" both down without provocation. Worse yet there is a black Judas who has sold them out. Instead of a suspense thriller, Matsoukas and company would prefer to preach to the choir of the disaffected, the oppressed who now revel in becoming the oppressors, serving up a cold dish of payback in revenge for years of discrimination at the hands of the white establishment.",Queen & Slim
23,kevin_robbins,"There is so much to love about the characters, acting, writing, dialogue and cinematography of this picture. I honestly think this should have been up for best picture",10,18 May 2021,"Queen and Slim (2019) is a movie the Mrs and I watched in theatres as soon as it was released. The storyline is around a couple out on their initial date when an overzealous police officer pulls them over and pulls his gun. One thing leads to another and the police officer ends up shot and the couple go on the run. They quickly become a national storyline and in some ways a hero but in the eyes of law enforcement, public enemy number one. How long can they hide and avoid law enforcement or will they escape the United States and lead a life of happiness? This movie is directed by Melina Matsoukas (Insecure) and stars Daniel Kaluuya (Get Out), Jodie Turner-Smith (Jett), Bokeem Woodbine (Dead Presidents) and Flea (Back to the Future II). The storyline for this is so compelling and has so many great sub plots and elements. I loved how it displayed how families sometimes treat each other for the best and worst at the same time and how those you think you cant trust can be helpful and your own can be your worst enemy. There is so much to love about the characters, acting, writing, dialogue and cinematography of this picture. I honestly think this should have been up for best picture and would easily score it a 10/10. Love this movie.",Queen & Slim
24,stevendbeard,Black Bonnie & Clyde,6,30 November 2019,"I saw ""Queen & Slim"", starring Daniel Kaluuya-Black Panther, Get Out; Jodie Turner_Smith-Nightflyers_tv, The Last Ship_tv; Bokeem Woodbine-Spider_Man:Homecoming, Riddick and Flea-Baby Driver, The Big Lebowski, and yes, he is also from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
This is sort of like a black version of Bonnie & Clyde. Daniel & Jodie are on a first date and he is taking her home when they are pulled over by a policeman. The policeman seems to be just looking for something to arrest them on-he searches the trunk but doesn't find anything. Jodie gets agitated with the way he is acting-she is an attorney and knows her rights-and she gets out of the car. That's when things go bonkers. The policeman shoots her, Daniel jumps the officer and during the struggle, Daniel shoots and kills him. That is when Daniel & Jodie decide to make a run for it-not a great idea. Of course, the officer's video cam in his patrol car caught everything and soon, the video goes viral. Civilians start idolizing the couple on the run, saying things like the cop deserved it for all the innocent people being shot by policeman nowadays. Bokeem plays Jodie's uncle that helps them and leads them to a friend of his from the military, Flea, who also helps them. The acting is decent but there is not much new here-especially if you are familiar with the Bonnie & Clyde story.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, language, drug use and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 11 minutes.

More tricky is the debate over rights and wrongs which are many and varied - the couple, the police and America and its institutional racism.

29,Pairic,Interesting THriller,7,3 February 2020,"Queen & Slim: Not Bonnie & Clyde maybe a bit more like True Romance crossed With Wild At Heart.Cleveland Ohio, Queen (Jodie Turner-Smith) is a lawyer she only went on a date with Slim (Daniel Kaluuya) because she had a bad day at work. They have a chance run in with a surly police officer who shoots and wounds Queen, in the ensuing struggle Slim grabs the officer's gun and shoots him dead. They flee the scene and thus begins a road movie in several parts.Lena Waithe has supplied a sharp script but the the duo's decision to flee isn't totally convincing (Queen after all is a lawyer), they don't learn until later that the cop had previously killed a Black teenager and their action was now being seen as a revenge action. They meet some odd characters along the road including a moronic store clerk and a guy who thinks they are the new Panthers. Not all cops are stereotyped, they encounter a Sheriff who offers to help them but they couldn't accept as that would have ended the film after 30 minutes. Other bizarre characters emerge when arrive at Queen's Uncle's house in New Orleans.The consequences of their actions are explored as others are moved to action. Some protest, some shoot at police. The very real fear of the Black community of police shootings plays a large part in the unfolding of the film. But it does show the complexities of the incident which started off the chase.

33,rgkarim,Queen Of Politics and Slim On Secondary Character Development. This Drama Is Power Messages Lost to Editing Choices,7,28 November 2019,"Another holiday, another week to try and get the most out of the movies and the shopping frenzy of Black Friday. Tonight's feature is another political drama that will potentially lead to much discussion, potential motivation, and certainly a lot of discussion about the quality of the movie. Given the heated reviews I've seen so far, I'm going to do my best to put an objective focus on this review and give you heads up as to whether or not one should take this film in for the holiday theater run. Let's get started as I look at:
LIKES:Acting
Symbolism
Adventure mixed with Morals
Cultural Representation Tasteful At Times
MusicDISLIKES:Long
Slow Pace
Super political at parts that detracts from story
Secondary character are sort of at lost
A bit stereotypical at times
Lazy writing in dialogue at times
Predictable
Editing IssuesThe Verdict:Queen and Slim's two main leads are stellar, taking very shallow characters and evolving their performances with to match the development. Their chemistry is fantastic with each other, really delivering a believable relationship that does not feel forced or scripted, but rather natural and flowing. It's this component that will be the core foundation for the film, as both Kaluuya and Turner-Smith are capable of delivering the politically charged content in heated yet classy ways. As you can guess, this movie has a lot of hot topics built into it, and the movie utilizes the cinematography to bring lots of symbolism into the film. Sequences are designed to capture the full power of many topics of interest, attempting to again balance the heat of the moment with an objective take sort of capturing a news debate in a more entertaining form. Queen and Slim's adventure is definitely a road trip that should be engaging for target audiences of drama/political lovers, but for those looking for messages to motivate you should see this achieved as well. Preachy at times (as most of these films are), this tale does a nice job of instilling the writer's values into a classy, ethical manner that will provide some food for thought and reanalyzing one's approach to these arguments. In addition, several members in my audience mentioned that they appreciated the cultural representation at key moments and the importance of pride and reputation as several secondary characters showed. I found that though stereotypical, it was tasteful compared to what other movies have done in the past. Finally, the music has enough musical genres to make an entertaining soundtrack, with R&B, Rap, and Hip hop ready to blast through the speakers during transition sequences. Not the most relevant in terms of story, but a good soundtrack is always welcome in my book to get my feet moving.However, I agree with my reviewers there are some decisions made in this movie I felt detracted from the messages and story they wanted to tell. My limitation starts with the length of the film and the pace that did not support the length. Much of the film feels very drawn out, bloated sequences that did not need to be present, while other times it was a little too focused on pointing out the obvious. As I mentioned earlier, Queen and Slim requires the two main characters to be the focus of all the political writing in the movie. While they excel at this, the supporting characters are a little too much in the background for my tastes. Like connecting the dots, the farther the two travel the more diluted the characters become, leading to plain interactions with most, often to introduce a new angle and conversation topic to discuss. I'll admit I liked seeing the influence the two had, especially at the end, but I had hoped for a little more progression and pertinence than what we got. The truth is that this film really focuses on hitting all the political issues so hard that it sort of drives off from the story and leave the main characters in side scenes while the people they have talked to ""evolve"" so to speak. Most of these scenes were... okay, but a couple were so convoluted and unnecessary, that I only saw it as a more time extension than quality shot, again meant for a politically charged audience. Throw in much of the writing is again back to lots of cursing and insults to go with the stereotypical portrayals and well, you sort of drown the better writing in this representation. Overall, the main thing that this movie suffers from is the editing and trying to be too tastefully political in the sequences sort of diluted the incredible potential of the story.Queen and Slim is a drama that has important messages for the world to see and think on, and does a decent job with not making them too aggressive. Yet, in terms of an entertaining story that has the full picture of suspense, discussion, and storytelling it still has areas of improvement to go. It's the editing and how much they wanted to include that I think got this film in trouble, and because of the side tangents and attempts to personify the problems in this character, the story got scattered. For those that want their political ideals represented and relate to the trials each character has, this movie is a theater visit, but for the rest of the audience, I feel the investment at a home watch is going to be key to maximizing your experience.My scores are:Drama: 7.0
Movie Overall: 5.5",Queen & Slim
34,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Queen & Slim,7,29 November 2019,"""So what happens tonight?"" These are the words of Ernest ""Slim"" Hines in Queen & Slim (my latest review). Yeah, a lot ""happens"" in Queen & Slim. From the opening diner sequence, it's flat-out dangerous and relentless.Anyway, Queen & Slim is a fictional vehicle in which every frame projects a decaying cityscape, a foreboding niche, or a totally rundown neighborhood. With almost every scene focusing on the protagonist criminals while letting the antagonist law enforcement appear in the background like paperweight black hats, Queen & Slim features actors Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith in ride or die, Bonnie and Clyde mode.As far as 2019 releases go, Queen & Slim has remnants of Bonnie and Clyde, True Romance, and 1986's Wisdom. Sadly, it also has a bullet-ridden conclusion that doesn't justify the exhausting journey the main characters take.That doesn't mean I'm not gonna recommend it. Queen & Slim's director (rookie Melina Matsoukas) presents a bleak vision of racial injustice and badge number hellfire that although fictitious and one-sided, feels all-too real. With Melina's streamlined and atmospheric direction and Tat Radcliffe's massively surrounding camerawork, I felt like I was in Queen & Slim. Heck, I felt like I was living it.Queen & Slim chronicles Ernest ""Slim"" Hines and Angela ""Queen"" Johnson. They go on a first date only to get pulled over by an overzealous cop. When said cop threatens to shoot them over nothing but a failed turn signal, ""Slim"" accidentally kills the police officer and the two go cross-country in search of their ""crossing the border"" freedom.All in all, I dug Queen & Slim's soundtrack full of jazzy riffs, hip-hop sonnets, and numbing instrumentals. I also dug the raw performances from pretty much everyone involved (look for Bokeem Woodbine playing a tripped out ""Uncle Earl"").What starts out as an edgy expedition you can't look away from to a love story where two once strangers connect, Queen & Slim gives you a curious enough reason to hit the cineplex this Thanksgiving. It's a movie we need today even if it hurts inside to watch. Rating: 3 stars.",Queen & Slim

36,vengeance20,"Good Film, but too long & dragged out",7,1 February 2020,"Seen this tonight after being newly released yesterday on Friday the 31st January.The film is about a black couple who after a first date are pulled over by a police officer for a minor traffic violation. Things quickly escalate as the power happy officer assaults, over reacts & attacks the man to which he shoots the officer in self defence. The couple is then forced to go on the run but while doing so begin to bond & find out about each other.I found the film to be pretty good, it delivers a message, a tired out one but I guess a message. The film suffers from the slow pacing & dragged directing. The points in the film where the couple made a few stop offs, yes, I know, from the synopsis, it states that the second half of the film is about the couple getting to know each other but it came off a both distracting & pointless given the fact the film was mainly about the couple going on the run. The political message that all whites are evil BS doesn't help in today's climate. Again, I know that's the films theme but like other films (Bombshell in particular) it's narrow minded, one sided PC Propaganda message with a toxic meaning.The ending is sad & surprising. You'll see what I mean when you watch.Overall a good film, but too long winded & distracting at some points. Not to mention political. 7/10",Queen & Slim

38,Abdulxoxo,Starts good but,6,13 January 2021,"In terms of the filmmaking I think it's well-put and very stylish looking movie. The two lead performers are extremely competent in their roles. In addition I have to say that the opening act of the film, specifically the sequence with the police officer, is absolutely brilliant. It's so intense! It immediately reminds of The Hate U Give. Unfortunately, from the moment the couple decide to drive away, the film quickly begin to lose me. I understand why they decided to drive away. I just feel strongly that it's the wrong decision. From then on, the movie becomes a little frustrating as our two leads continually make poor choices. As well as the characters making poor choices, I also feel that narratively the story go in some directions that are unexpected and not in a good way.
Overall, This film is obviously written to provide a socio-political message about race, legacy and perceptions but Queen & Slim just felt underwhelming and tad preachy at times.",Queen & Slim
39,martimusross,"Badly Handled Incoherent Plot, So Many People Walked Out",3,4 December 2019,"Queen & SlimI saw this at the unlimited secret screening.Ultimately this movie was so fatally flawed in so many aspects that it just left a nasty taste in the mouth.What was goodThere was strong and convincing acting from the two main leads, Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith however she was so cold, rude and manipulative for us to believe we had a Romeo and Juliet moment. I would have opened the car door and thrown her out.The road trip element kept us interested and was reminiscent of Thelma and Louise in its haphazardness.The music was good.What was totally hashedThe plot - The nasty tinder date led to being stopped by the police, they had swerved in the car, and this led the policeman, quite rightly believing he was driving under the influence of drink and/or drugs. I have been stopped and I complied to the letter the instructions the policeman gave me. Why would you antagonise/backchat/sass a man with a gun. We had an almost identical scene in The Hate U Give, and it is just an incoherent plot.The choices - as a lawyer she knew with the camera footage she had a good chance of arguing her case in court, she knew she could never run so why did she try. Quite ridiculous!The tone - much of the plot was comedic and was not specifically a issue led race movie, but towards the end it became inferred the whole movie was about race, well it wasn't as a black cop was gunned down as well. It really was neither fish nor fowl.There was a good deal of stylistic elements that distracted from the drama for example the cutting between the sex scene and the protest march.Lastly the ending was quite moronic they clearly were unarmed and so would not have been gunned down, this was no Bonnie & Clyde or Butch Cassidy.Lastly I have had a gutful of issue led movies that demonise men, white people, politicians, policemen, equality, social security etc. Hollywood is just not best placed to contrive a drama to raise these issues as it is all so unbalanced.",Queen & Slim

43,Richie-67-485852,SLIM TO NONE,7,2 September 2020,"Nice little journey into the familiar world of a police stop and just one of the many things that can happen. No one likes a ticket, being pulled over and having their Constitutional rights suspended for even a quick moment so we all agree. Furthermore, I have had contact with every sort of cop out there In my lifetime) just like every sort of person too. Some people I stay away from others I gravitate toward and everything in between. No such choices for a police stop. We are reminded when watching of real life and how unfair things can be or get but we should also be reminded not to add to our own personal woes either. Why? Because like everything all things pass-on. The wise let them do so and then use their skills and talents to continue to journey or turn lemons into lemonade. Easier said than done but isn't that what gives it the value? Is it not the true test of anything in the field of adventure, experience and learning curve? Here we see poor decisions instead of virtue, righteous suffering ignored instead of using the evil for good, we are recruited into the world of what does not work. Called temptation, it is not a respecter of persons and roams the earth during our lifetimes seeking out to destroy, rob and torment us. We have the ability to not only overcome and withstand but to prevail, grow and become a better person when righteousness is at work for everyone's sake too. What I found disturbing was that not only were human lives taken in this movie but without remorse. There are some disturbing moral/unethical lines that should never be crossed but they were. There is a Bonnie and Clyde feel to this movie but to me, that is the wrong message to send. A scene where a little boy idol worships wrongly and then acts out that wrong disturb deeply. Watch this movie but learn from it. Improve on the object lessons and use it to help contribute a better world and way for us all. Love until it hurts is the best approach...",Queen & Slim
44,drjgardner,"Great start, then flame out",2,30 November 2019,"What a disappointment. The film starts off great, though truth be told, the coming attractions gave most of it away. But the acting is so great you go along for the ride. But somewhere in the middle it starts to drag. Apparently the director is in love with extended geography scenes, as if this is a travel show. Well, at least the photography is wonderful, even if it is wasting my time. But from here it goes downhill. There is a senseless killing, which if it had any sense at all, should have been exploited, but isn't. The ending itself, if muffled, really doesn't have the impact that was intended. A ""Black Bonnie and Clyde"" would be welcome, but this film isn't it.",Queen & Slim
45,rockman182,Queen & Slim(2019),7,11 December 2019,"I've been playing catch up with films that came out recently and the next one on my list was Queen & Slim. I haven't heard of filmmaker Melina Matsoukas as she's mostly directed music videos. This is also the first time I've seen Jodie Turner-Smith in anything. The film hits on timely and real issues however I'm not sure if its approach always works. However, its a well acted and interesting film with implications that due resonate in society today.
The film is about a black man and woman on a date. On their way home they are pulled over by a hostile, trigger happy white cop and one thing leads to another and the cop is shot dead and the footage taped in the dashboard camera of the police vehicle. The pair go on the run across the country as they become wanted fugitives. They must try to find help and assistance and also come to terms with the reality of their situation and how it drastically changes their lives.
The performances in this film are top notch. I think Jodie Turner-Smith bursts into the scene and really makes an impression. I liked the lead characters and the emotional weight of the situation they find themselves in. The social and race issues in the film are definitely relevant today, there's no denying that. However, I felt like the film does rely on that quite a bit and it explores some parts of the issues but disregards other aspects.
Another thing I felt was that the film was quite long and twenty or so minutes could and should have been left on the cutting room floor. Still, this is quite an impressive directorial debut for Matsoukas who finds a voice with what she wants to stay with this film. A modern day Bonnie and Clyde on the run, becoming icons and heroes for a community. Strong messages for sure, just not always delivered to the fullest extent.
7/10",Queen & Slim
46,0w0,"Bad writing, OK acting, unrealistic situations",5,25 February 2020,"The movie starts with a very unrealistic situation, which is just sloppy writing because something like that would never happen the way that it was protrayed in the film, and right after that situation happens, another very unrealistic situation happens shortly after that, which is double-sloppy writing...After the first 30minutes, the movie starts to take shape and starts to become believable... It then follows the two main character's poorly planned escape from prosecution. But throughout the rest of the movie, the main characters make some very stupid descisions (an obvious attempt from the script writers to keep the tension up and build false suspense), which more than once result in the main characters ALMOST being caught, but not quite.Overall the movie is watchable, though the first 30minutes were painful to watch and has sloppy writing. With a better written beginning, this movie could have been a 7/10 but it just ends up being a mish-mash of good-bad scenes and poor writing... 5/10",Queen & Slim
47,cliftonofun,"Flawed, but gripping",7,18 June 2021,"This movie definitely grabbed me (and moved me) - the performances were phenomenal, the tensions were elevated from the jump, and the beautiful filmmaking only added to the foreboding sense that things would get worse before they got better. Unfortunately, the set-up is perfect, but the dialogue isn't. Many of the conversations feel more like someone's first stageplay than someone's first film script - trying a bit too hard and undercutting the film's very real terror. That's the lawyer's recommendation?! That's the stranger's initial reaction?! Plus, the movie might have been better served by an under 2 hour runtime and faster pacing in the middle. Still, the end result is pretty haunting - a Bonnie & Clyde story with much more to say and much more reason to care. I won't forget it anytime soon.",Queen & Slim
48,garethcrook,We know where this goes...,6,30 March 2020,"A first date that goes from really quite well, to... anything but. Right from the outset Slim and Queen are likeable. She's a lawyer, he works at Costco. He's warm and personable, she's a little colder but far from heartless. They're both black. The cop that pulls them over as Slim drives Queen home is white. We know where this goes and it's no place good. Guns, racism, police brutality, I've not said yet, but you've guessed we're in America. Cleveland in the winter to be precise, judging by the badge on the cop as he's lay dead on the floor after needlessly pulling his gun on Slim and shooting Queen in the leg. What follows is an escape or an attempt, one that's more humorous and entertaining than the event that started this chain would suggest. Arriving in New Orleans the unlikely couple hatch a plan, but this is no farcical road trip cop chase. It's stylish and raw, mixed with something akin to a romcom buddy movie. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith glide through each scene, especially Kaluuya who portrays the injustice of their situation and the desire keep living with ease. I'd be lying if I didn't admit it goes a bit over the top on bravado occasionally... who the hell goes dancing in a blues club when on the run? But then the escape is essentially a second date and live blues sure sounds good. I guess I was expecting more grit. It's a bit heavy on helping hands on route as their celebrity status via the news increases. It seems that they're able to drive across the country almost unchallenged, so despite the protests in the streets, the swat team raids on supporting friends, it feels quite sanitised. The message here though is simple black oppression, the community sticking together, protecting itself against the white man. It feels too much like entertainment though, diluting that message and hiding it in a love story, but perhaps that's the point, that this is normal. Even in modern America that still has the audacity to claim it's the greatest country in the world.",Queen & Slim
49,ronakkotian,Has a thrilling opening but loses the thrill by the end,7,31 January 2021,"I love Daniel Kaluuya's work. Especially after his extraordinary performance in Get Out, I was excited to see the films he would do after that and he impressed me again in Queen & Slim.Queen & Slim shows a couple on their first date which takes a dark turn once a police officer pulls them over.The film has a very strong opening. It wastes no time in introducing us to our two main leads on their first date and the horrible event that followed kept me on the edge of my seat. For her debut film, Melina Matsoukas does a competent job directing. The first act was thrilling and intense which kept me fully invested in what was going on. Slowly the film loses that thrilling aspect and ends up being more of a romance film. I get that it was a way to develop the characters but at the same time I feel it lowered the stakes set by the opening and that made it less investing. The film's runtime is 2 hours 10 minutes which I feel was a bit too long. If the film was shorter and moved at a faster pace then I think it would've been more engaging.What I appreciated though was the development of the two protagonists. I immediately connected with Slim as he was more laid-back and had a calmer personality. I wasn't too fond with Queen but as I learnt more about her and her past, I felt more sympathetic towards her and made me want to root for this couple. The reserved performance by Daniel Kaluuya is fantastic and Jodie Turner-Smith, who I'm not so familiar with, really surprised me by how good she acted. They both seemed believable as this couple and had great chemistry with each other. The ending was predictable but Melina Matsoukas, Lena Waithe and James Frey did a good job conveying the Black experience in America and it felt real throughout.Queen & Slim was a decent film. The performances by Kaluuya and Turner-Smith were stellar and debutant Melina Matsoukas did a good job for her first film. The message isn't anything new, and at this point it does feel repetitive to see the same themes being shown in Black films, but it was well told and handled.",Queen & Slim
50,jordan2240,"Entertaining, but I thought an exaggerated take on social issues",6,29 March 2020,"I enjoyed the movie, but I do think it did a social injustice by exaggerating the level of police ineptitude and injustice with regard to blacks. Yes, there have been present-day issues that indicate an inequity in the justice system based on race, but the ending of this film, in particular, goes well beyond what I'd consider a reasonable portrayal of such inequity. Perhaps as a white guy I'm being naive, but it would have made much more sense to me had the couple done something at the end that at least looked like they weren't simply surrendering. Kind of ruined the film for me.",Queen & Slim
51,PedroPires90,"Very good, but less 20 minutes would make it even better",8,8 May 2021,"A lot to take and to think after finishing this. The acting is outstanding. I'm used to see that from Kaluuya, but seeing Jodie with maybe an even stronger performance was a surprise to me and now I get why she is being casted for everything in Hollywood. The chemistry between the two is so good that I'm sad that we won't be able to see the couple back again. It felt...real.The direction was different, special, very good shots, putting the actors in the middle of everything, but also showing us great scenarios and some memorable scenes, with a very good cinematography helping all the time, with a dreamy feeling most of the time. However, I have some issues with the 2nd act and with the pace during that part of the film. IMO the film would have benefited a lot from a different editing and less 20 minutes of it during that act, as the 1st and the 3rd are certainly much stronger and better paced and I don't think this plot justifies 130 minutes.It's not easy to mix crime and romance, expecially with such a sensitive theme behind like racism and police brutality, but I believe that, overall, the results are very good. It's a film that will have an impact, will stay with you and will probably be a much more important phenomenon in the future than it is right now. Melina is a director to keep an eye on and Jodie is already a star.",Queen & Slim
52,Draysan-Jennings,Unrealistic,6,21 January 2020,"The cop literally pulls his gun on Slim for no reason. I wouldn't suggest telling a cop to hurry up,
but that's definetly not a reason to pull your gun. If I was slim I would played it cool and just taken the ticket. Anytime you give a cop a hard time they make life harder on you. Anyways, while he has his gun drawn Queen reaches for her phone and gets shot. Why would you reach for your pockets while a gun is pointed at you? So stupid! Then she leaves the scene of the crime and goes on the run. She should of stayed there. She did absolutely nothing wrong. Just a bunch of bad decisions. The movie started to go downhill after that scene. Really slowed down and started to drag. The ending was terrible. Why did they stop when the cops were driving up to them on the runway? They could of ran to the plane and fled. Who in their right mind would of just stopped? And why didn't they get on the ground and surrender? It was like they wanted to die. That whole end scene was stupid AF and didn't make sense to me. This movie was almost pointless. I wouldn't recommend it .",Queen & Slim
53,ethanbresnett,Stunning. Powerful. Beautiful,9,7 November 2020,"Queen & Slim is such a beautiful and tragic film. It feels like an epic, while also having such an intimate feel.The first thing to mention is that the performances by Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith were phenomenal. The chemistry between them was absolutely perfect, and the transformation of their relationship throughout the film was stunningly played out by the two of them. I was so captivated by their performances. They both managed to convey the power, beauty and tragedy of the screenplay so effectively, it really was incredible.The story is equally jaw dropping, and all the more poignant given the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020. The film isn't an easy watch at times, reflecting the ugliest parts of society in an uncompromising way. But despite this, there's so much beauty and heart in the film, most notably in the relationship between Kaluuya and Turner-Smith. As a film it has some fantastic twists and turns, with some great pacing too. The film navigates between heart racing moments and more measured moments of reflection effortlessly. It will definitely keep you hooked and on the edge of your seat until the final frame.Queen & Slim is also a very atmospheric film, oozing style, and very artsy in parts. The direction from Melina Matsoukas was astonishingly good, with some truly fantastic visuals and imagery. As well as this the soundtrack was spot on and used expertly to compliment the themes of the film and the transformations of our protagonists.Quite simply Queen & Slim is stunning, and is a must watch in my opinion.",Queen & Slim

The Hate U Give was a film that got it just right, using what appears to be a fairly standard high-school film to do something very powerful. Queen & Slim, unfortunately, seems to get much wrong. It takes the subject head-on; there's little in the way of subtlety here. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but the script is too on the nose, too obvious to really enable us to think and feel more deeply. Taking a road-movie/Bonnie and Clyde sort of approach, it also becomes too episodic - it's disjointed, and it sometimes jars too much. The central characters also take a series of almost implausibly bad decisions; all of which together means it's ultimately a bit too hard to feel or think in the way the subject demands and deserves; and it also wastes the excellent Daniel Kaluuya, whose talents deserve better. Not a bad film by any means, but there's much better out there that covers similar ground.",Queen & Slim

The movie is based on the lie that the greatest danger to a black man is a blue man or maybe a white-blue man. The greatest danger to a black man is a black man. That's just a fact.

Over the next 65 minutes the plot got more and more absurd...I say 65 minutes as that is about the time I put on my jacket and made my way home.
In a world of sequels, remakes and superheros , we so badly need movies with new ideas and edges...but this just put it all back 20 years.
The old "" white cop shoots black guy "" story has been told many times before and much,mush better....a new slant on things may have been welcome.
Right the way through the racist language from all involved was so way over the top it was stomach churning.
2 innocent people get caught up in the killing of a cop and decide to run away for a dance and a horse riding lesson??

60,christian94,Feature Film Debute Triumph,9,14 October 2020,"Daniel Kaluuya delivers another amazing performance and Jodie Turner-Smith can definitely hold her own on the big screen. The chemistry between the two works, yet to me the biggest credit goes to Melina Matsoukas who manages to direct this good story and maje it great. She creates many memorable scenes including the visit to the uncle, the glock-curious clerk, many quirky car scenes, and the best sex scene I have scene in years - visually and emotionally. She creates moods, tension and characters who we come to care deeply about. Pete Beaudreau's editing, with Margin Call 2011) credit, for this 132mins cut is also to be noted. He shines in the sex scene/riot dual storytelling and many other moments to advance and tell the story with suspense and continued interest.Writing-wise, Slim's story about the origin of babies is well-written and acted. The screenplay holds lots of gems and character-building. Beyond its numerous plot twist, t is profound and real. It can be excused for its few deus ex machina moments and black/white overpolarization at times.The post-climatic scenes are very well done and the choice of music throughout is stellar and appropriate, from R&B to Pimp rap.Well-done Bonnie&Clydesque tale with a conscious and purpose.",Queen & Slim

63,austin0731,Loses its focus,7,9 December 2019,"Queen & Slim is the modern day Bonnie & Clyde story of a couple on a first date who end up being cop killers and go on the run. On paper I think it is an effective but generic story, which takes an interesting twist on the classic premise. Queen & Slim manages to accomplish that which it promised and then some, however, I did find some other aspects to on the nose.The film starts off great, with a brilliant performance by Get Out's Daniel Kaluuya and a more distant and cold delivery from Jodie Turner-Smith that unfortunately turned me off. Despite this, Daniel Kaluuya carries this film and eventually the chemistry between the two won me back into this budding relationship as they continue on the run. From start to around the midpoint of the film I would describe Queen & Slim as an intense on the run film with tender and quiet moments of silence.However, the second to last act begins to lose me as the sense of immediate danger is removed, and we see them travel from point to point as they slowly move towards their end goal. The film almost seems to slow down and lose focus to deal with the impact of their actions and attempts to make social commentaries on racial descrimination and police brutality. While this is a very important message to examine I felt that it removes the audience from the main focus that is the bond between two characters, the execution was also too straightforward and predictable; I would have preferred a more subtle reference to these subjects, if any.Despite of this, Queen & Slim is nonetheless a solid film, an interesting character study but unfortunately slightly deviates from the story it was trying to tell.",Queen & Slim

65,Bertaut,A powerful socio-political statement disguised as a road-movie,7,12 February 2020,"White police officers killing black men is something we've seen much of in recent years, and it's been represented in films such as Fruitvale Station (2013); The Hate U Give (2018), Monsters and Men (2018); and Widows (2018). And to that list you can now add Queen & Slim, albeit with an asterisk, because here, it's a black man killing a white police officer. But, and this is a key point, he does so only in self-defence. Embracing the notion that Black Lives very much Matter, the film is something of a stealth social commentary insofar as it wears the disguise of the classic genre template of a duo on the run à la films such as They Live by Night (1948), Bonnie and Clyde (1967), Badlands (1973), and Thelma & Louise (1991). And it works perfectly well as a taut road-movie. However, underneath the genre elements, you'll find a condemnation of a criminal justice system that seemingly targets minorities, a celebration of black unity and cultural vibrancy, and an examination of Trump's divided America. It's not an angry diatribe per se, certainly not in the sense that some of Spike Lee's films are, but it does attempt to Speak Truth to Power and it is fundamentally of the moment. It also happens to be a very fine film, albeit a little too long and with some tonal inconsistencies.Queen (a superb debut performance by model Jodie Turner-Smith) and Slim (a brilliant Daniel Kaluuya) are on a date, having met on Tinder. However, things are not going especially well, as they quickly discover they have virtually nothing in common. He works at Costco, is a devout Christian, and wants a family; she's an atheistic defence attorney with no filter for her often acerbic comments, and has no interest in raising a family. As he drives her home, they're pulled over by Officer Reed (Sturgill Simpson), who is unnecessarily threatening and belligerent from the start. When draws his weapon and orders Slim to the ground, Queen attempts to record what's happening, but Reed shoots her in the leg. Slim then tackles Reed, gets his gun, and kills him. Slim wants to remain at the scene, but Queen points out that a black man has just shot a white cop with his own gun, and if they stay, the best they can hope for is prison. And so the duo find themselves on the lam, with Slim concocting a vague plan to head south from Ohio to Miami, and ultimately on to Cuba. Meanwhile, mostly without their knowledge, they become the symbol for and inspiration behind a nationwide protest movement against racially-motivated police violence.Queen & Slim is written by Lena Waithe, from a story by Waithe and James Frey (yep, that James Frey), and is directed by Melina Matsoukas in her feature directorial debut. Although at a structural level, Queen & Slim is a classic duo on the run film, at a thematic level it focuses on socio-political issues such as ethnic tension, systemic racism, unchecked police violence, communal anger, and both the importance and danger of protest movements (it's telling that the film doesn't paint every protestor as a paragon of virtue). Concerning this, a key point is that the film doesn't try to be a piece of social realism. On their journey from Ohio to Miami, Queen and Slim encounter a litany of black characters, all of whom know exactly who they are, all of whom approve of what they did and treat them like folk heroes (except a mechanic (Gralen Bryant Banks) who's unimpressed with their actions). This isn't done to suggest that black identity in the US is monolithic, rather it's to make an allegorical point; it's a reference to a ""them and us"" mentality. This allegorical sense is heightened further with references to slave catchers, chain gangs, and the Underground Railroad.Aside from this, the other major theme is the notion of legacy. This is tied into the fact that Queen and Slim are symbols for a nationwide movement. The fact that they don't see themselves as symbols, doesn't matter to the people who mythologise them. When Slim kills Reed, he and Queen flee because they assume they won't get a fair trial in a country that sees race before all else (and remember, she's a lawyer). And this assumption is what forms the basis of the movement built in their name, with black people shown as exasperated by such treatment. In such a dangerously volatile milieu, Queen and Slim provide the spark that sets the tinderbox aflame.Looking at the aesthetic side of things, Waithe's screenplay does a good job of telling us who Queen and Slim are from the get-go, taking only a few moments during the opening scene to set up many of the characteristics that will prove important later (his faith, for example, or her acerbity). And because the scene is a first date, the dialogue can introduce such getting-to-know-you material without it seeming expositionary or inorganic. The acting is also terrific. Turner-Smith, in her first feature film role, plays Queen as the realist to Slim's idealist, someone who has sacrificed much to achieve success and who, although she hides it, is deeply lonely. Kaluuya plays Slim as an eternal optimist, someone who trusts others, but is also borderline naïve, in a performance that's the complete inverse of the intimidating enforcer he played in Widows.There are some problems though. For example, on a few occasions, the movie inexplicably starts using voiceover. But not normal voiceover. Two characters will be shown having a normal conversation and then some of the dialogue is delivered as VO, only for the normal conversation to resume again. If it was confined to Queen and Slim, I might think it was a poorly-conceived attempt to draw us into their psyche, but it isn't. So, I honestly don't know what the point is, but it sure is distracting and seems to come from a different film entirely. Some scenes are also just too fanciful; such as a scene where the duo stop so Slim can ride a horse or a bizarre scene with a gas station clerk, which (I think) is supposed to be comic relief, but which is just too tonally divorced from everything else. Another poorly conceived scene, sees Matsoukas cut to Slim's father (Thom Gossom Jr.) to show us that the police are monitoring his phone. It's an entirely unnecessary scene, and it breaks the rigidly maintained focalisation, which up to this point has been entirely confined to Queen and Slim. The film also runs about 15 minutes too long, with several fake-out endings, and in its final moments, it veers very close to melodrama.These issues notwithstanding, however, this is a strong film that works on several levels. On the one hand, it's a decent duo-on-the-run story; on the other, it's a film tuned into the socio-political frequency of the times. A snapshot of a house divided against itself, it paints a bleak picture of a group that has been pushed and prodded to the point where combustion may be unavoidable. 31% of Americans believe that a second Civil War will happen within their lifetime, and it will almost certainly be race-related. Queen & Slim suggests they might just be correct.",Queen & Slim

67,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Good but could have been better.,7,11 June 2020,"I liked this film for the most part. I think the big issues to me were the premise of them being on the run. I can totally buy a cop with an itchy trigger finger looking for an excuse for a fight. But I just dont believe (at least with Queen) that their first thought would be...""We have to go on the run"". I mean, she is a lawyer. You would think she would be the level headed one to rationalize that they are making their situation worse by running. And especially since she is a lawyer she could call up her firm for help. Unless she works independently, but still she likely knows another lawyer or a judge she can call. And I can't even buy a ""Well she was just shot at, she's in shock, she's not thinking clearly defense but she rather quickly tells Slim to not call his family because they'll be accomplices and to throw away their phones so that they can't be tracked. And Slim is shown to be religious and he even at one points says to Queen ""Maybe it was God's plan for me to die"" and he and Queen were on their first date and seemingly didnt even like each other so I kept wondering why he was just blindly following along with whatever she said. I'm not against the Bonnie and Clyde narrative, I think I would have just preferred if their backgrounds were a tad different. The second thing that bugged me the most was the ending. Either they are suddenly cool with being martyrs or they have a Romeo & Juliet thing going on where if they cant live together then at least they'll die together. And like..........why? They only knew each other for like 5 days and they didnt even like each other for most of those 5 days. Why are they suddenly each other's ""ride or die"". And yes I am using that term because Slim says in the movie at one point that he is looking for his ""ride or die"". I wasn't expecting the film to have a happy ending. But, I dunno this ending wasnt it either. I will say as well that the film could have been edited down as well. It does feel long and it does feel a little repetitive in parts. I think you could have probably cut out the part where their car breaks down and they need to go to a mechanic. You could have right to the part where they meet Flea's character ( I forget his name) and it wouldnt have changed the outcome of the film in anyway.Besides those things though, I do think the film is an important one to watch. And I liked the 2 leads (Daniel Kaluuya & Jodie Turner Smith). And I liked the premise of being on the run and not knowing who trust. And there was certainly lots of high tension moments where you're not sure whether they're going to caught or not. And I think it's a testament to the writing that makes you (or at least me) root for them throughout the film. Overall I think the film was good but could have been better.",Queen & Slim

71,PotassiumMan,"Engrossing, ultimately hard-hitting fugitive drama",8,24 December 2019,"Powerful performances ignite this gritty film about a young African-American couple who on their first date are ambushed by a maniacal police officer who turns a routine traffic stop into a crime spree of his own. After engaging in self-defense and going on the run they both instantly become the targets of a nationwide search as they make a desperate run across the Deep South for their escape.The only real weaknesses of this film are a brief narrative drift and an undisciplined running time. And there is the occasional, eccentric use of voiceover narration, done in a way that I hope doesn't become a trend in movies. Otherwise, this is a first rate firm, set on fire by Kaluuya and Turner-Smith, who initially seem like polar opposites in terms of personality but once the irreversible brush with the law occurs, their lives are inextricably intertwined from there on out. Their initial lack of chemistry gives way to a common instinct to survive and adapt, however possible under desperate circumstances.A riveting soundtrack and lush cinematography give the film an occasionally wondrous feel, despite the squalid surroundings and a grim storyline. It's a gripping run from the law, that is powerfully acted and chock full of character. It feels like a film that has always been around and yet simply took until the present to be made. An old-fashioned story is worthwhile when it's told as well as it is here. Strongly recommended.",Queen & Slim

73,torrascotia,The Black Wall,7,26 January 2020,"This was the members preview screening at the Cameo in Edinburgh this month. There hasn't been much in terms of promotion for this movie. As someone who actively avoids trailers as they spoil far more than they should I took a gamble and went to see Queen & Slim.
The reviews seem to be either love or hate the movie and its obvious to see why.
This is an African American movie, told from their perspective which some audience members seem to have issues with. So much so that an elderly white lady walked out at a key point.
The movie starts off as being the worst Tinder date imaginable. A store worker meets a lawyer for a date, they do not seem to like each other much but they are forced together through the actions of a trigger happy racist policeman and what follows....
This is a love/road movie with the backdrop of police shootings in America. While it has been compared by some to Bonnie and Clyde that view seems to highlight racial bias in and of itself for the simple reason B & C were criminal multiple murdering outlaws. That simply isn't the case with Queen & Slim. Its also the reason why the black community, in the main, respond the way the do to the pair.
Whether you enjoy this movie will be down to your perspective of whether you side with the racist police character or the two main characters. Its as simple as that. If its the former then you wont like this at all.
This is a well paced, well shot and acted movie. Its also one of the best of the year. It is however not for everyone but quite simply, who cares?",Queen & Slim

Yes I am white and obviously not a racist. Even though a lot of my favourite actors are white (Leonardo dicaprio, Christian bale) . My all time favourite actor is Denzel Washington. As I see him age and although healthy and still has a lot of life left in cinema. I see the days coming where he can't play certain roles. Daniel has me excited for the future of cinema. I hate bringing colour into anything however I feel every bad review is just from a racist who has never even watched the movie and those racist probably think all these reviews are only from black people.

79,jburtonprod-802-759029,A Great Movie Reminicent of 70s Cinema but Stiil It's Own Thing.,9,23 August 2020,"I was a bit doubtful coming into this movie. I've really gotten sick of 'Politically Correct Cinema' and I thought this was just going to be another lecture posing as a motion picture. I was really surprised. It does flirt with being preachy but never quite gets there. And yes, most of the white people are assholes but there's some decent ones thrown in there as well.It reminded me of the outlaw cinema of 70s and it carries the same weight. I have no doubt if a black person in Trump's America shot a white police officer under those circumstances they would feel they had to run. What a statement to make about how screwed up this county is.The performances are outstanding and I thought it was great the way they took a difficult, hard hitting story and let it play out. They didn't fall into any P.C. traps. This is a movie in the company of Bonnie and Clyde, Easy Rider, Midnight Cowboy and other great independent movies of the 70s.",Queen & Slim
80,PaxtonMalloy,As if George Floyd would have happened already back then,8,28 June 2020,Life is ironic sometimes. I had this movie on my list since it came out. When I started watching it I remembered what the premise is and thought how crazy this is. A cop just killed George Floyd a few weeks ago which let to riots and the BlackLivesMatter movement. And here is a movie that came out before that hitting right on that topic of police brutality ans racism. Admittedly this is not the he first movie that tackles the topic but is for sure on of the best ones. David Kaluuya Jodie Turner-Smith are incredible. Their acting is so unbelievably great but not just them separately but the chemistry they have together. It is working right from the start and as they get closer we are just in love with them being in love. Despite it being kind of a thriller and kind of road movie and kind of a drama it is above all a love story. You will also notice how beautifully it is shot. Now I gotta say I hated the ending. Not how it ends because this was clear from the start but the way it happens is too convenient. But it is still a great movie carried by the two leads.,Queen & Slim
81,Filmdokter,"Strong story, mediocre execution",6,24 October 2021,"Black Lives Matter. It is the main theme of this film that kicks off with an almost documentary like feeling and a strong, plucked from the streets, opening before we even see the film's title. But the following 90 minutes is a mixed bag. The film tries to be many things: a social drama, a tense thriller, a love story. But the whole social ""black lives matter"" drama part is too on the nose, too forced and at times even a bit unbelievable. The thriller part only shines through every know and then. And the love story, though well acted, isn't that original. All in all a great starting point story wise, but in terms of execution it has its weaknesses.",Queen & Slim
82,cappiethadog,Somebody to love,7,12 December 2019,"Two black sharecroppers in a jalopy approaches Bonnie Parker(Faye Dunaway) and Clyde Barrow(Warren Beatty) on the opposite side of a two-lane country road. The infamous bank-robbing couple had stopped to assist an old man with a flat tire. Ivan(Dub Taylor) sees the sharecroppers first, and hides under the truck, wondering, perhaps, if there was a change in plans. C.W.(Michael J. Pollard), his son, rides with the Barrow Gang; he's the driver of the getaway car. C.W.'s father knows beforehand, rightfully, as it turns out, that law and order would handle matters by their own volition, but for an instant, the old man wonders if the ""Negroes"" were hired as contract killers. The encroaching vehicle is not the source of Clyde's anxiety; he neither hates nor fears black people, in Arthur Penn's ""Bonnie and Clyde"", the 1967 film about crime and celebrity during The Great Depression, which despite what screenwriter Lena Waithe tells the media, can't help but inform ""Queen and Slim"", the debut feature from Melina Matsoukas, the music video auteur responsible for Beyonce's saber-rattling ""Formation"". The media dubbed 1931-1934 as being the Public Enemy era, due to all the outlaw criminal activity, committed by larger-than-life characters such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and the subjects of Penn's film, Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. ""Queen and Slim"" evokes the term ""public enemy"", because any film that features lovers on the lam, like it or not, get saddled with the label, ""a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde"". Slim(David Kaluuya), a black everyman, murders Officer Reed(Sturgill Simpson), a racist cop, in self-defense after a routine traffic stop. ""Queen and Slim"" asks the polarizing question: ""Who is the public enemy?""They're assimilators, apolitical, Slim and Angela(Jodie Turner-Smith), a criminal defense attorney, who responded to her cheap date's Tinder posting. No cultural signifiers, this man and this woman, getting a quick bite to eat at a no-frills diner. Her, a white turtleneck; him, a regular old sweatshirt you can buy off the rack at The Gap; they're young Americans, period. That's how Angela treats the African-American waitress who gets her cheap date's order wrong; no hyphen necessary. She half-listens while Slim explains how hard their food server's life is, being a single mom with three kids. If Angela ordered her eggs over-easy, she would send back the scrambled yolks, three kids and government assistance, notwithstanding. Angela, no doubt, leans conservative. Without realizing it, Slim fails to make a strong impression by being a bleeding heart liberal. Slim, a middle-class Ohio local, didn't grow up with the same obstacles as Angela, a Louisiana native, who knows what it's like to be dirt-poor, therefore, she has a chip on her shoulder, expecting everybody to pull their own weight, regardless of color. Her life in the law profession should better prepare the defense attorney for the forthcoming altercation. Angela forgets that she's black. Silence, and complete utter compliance, the surrendering of ego, will keep her alive, albeit humiliated, during this all-too-common scenario, wherever black law-abiding citizens and white cops intersect. Angela's pride, however, gets in the way; she can't help but lecture the officer on the rule of law. This accomplished woman realizes too late that the policeman could care less about her occupation. She's outside of her bubble. Angela knows more people that look like Officer Reed than her cheap date. As a defense attorney, no doubt, Angela had clients she represented who fit Slim's profile, which is why she's got the temerity to ask, perhaps presume, that her nighttime companion has a permanent record. By association, this professional woman, this productive member of respectable society, thinks that she coopted a little white privilege for herself, some leeway in how she addresses the presiding officer. It doesn't work like that, and although it should not come as a shock, it does, when the man, one of many who carry the badge, responsible for protecting the public, shoots Angela in the left shoulder, even though her sudden movement was preceded by an announcement to Officer Reed, in the queen's English with a dialect-free voice, that she was removing her cell phone from a coat pocket. Slim's ease with people from all walks of life shows, too. His friendly, amiable personality served him well in the past. He tries to defuse the situation with harmless banter. ""Can you hurry it up?"" he asks, innocently, which the cop, searching for drugs in the suspect's trunk, perceives to be reason enough to draw his gun. Would it have mattered to Officer Reed that the black man, an innocent man, was merely cold, and not trying to be a wisenheimer? Probably not.Flee, the two of them, hiding in plain sight; their likenesses made ubiquitou when footage from the police dashboard camera goes public. At a convenience store, the clerk on duty recognizes his armed customer from the photo in the newspaper, a whole stack of them sitting near the cash register. The clerk strikes a bargain with Slim; he'll wave the price of gas if the fugitive lets him hold his firearm for awhile. Echoing the Arthur Penn film, Clyde Barrow lets a black man, the servant of a man whose home was foreclosed by the bank, have a turn at shooting out the windows. ""We rob banks,"" Clyde tells them, as he departs with the hillbilly family, knowing full-well that the evicted patriarch would approve. Likewise, after a tense moment when the clerk points the borrowed weapon at Slim, he hands it over, laughing, and makes good on the promise of free petrol. Slim never says: ""We shoot cops,"" but he doesn't have to; the clerk knows and approves of their renegade trade. The clerk confuses Slim and Angela for antiheroes. Besides, Angela and Slim are celebrities. Next up, food and drink; a chubby black child runs the errand as asked, returning with burgers and sodas, and a cell-phone, showing footage of these wanted criminals at the scene of th crime in grainy black and white. Panic-stricken, Slim nearly kills again, this time from behind the wheel; accidental vehicular manslaughter, when he nearly runs over the boy's father. Against Angela's advice, he drives them to the hospital. In lieu of a goodbye wave, the boy's father gives the accidental folk hero the Black Power salute. Apolitical, too, but different from his queen, Slim can't bring himself to return the upheld fist, made famous by the Panthers, because this young man never intended to be, or wants to be, the face of African-American vengeance.Their ride, a Pontiac Catalina, en route to the safe house, the second hub of a modern-day Underground Railroad, overheats, and needs pushing, backwards, to an auto repair shop. Uncle Earl(Bokeen Woodbine), a pimp, had loaned his niece the car, and clothes, a zebra-print dress and snakeskin boots, to go with the spartan hairdo that one of the working girls gives her. Slim, likewise, has a new look, outfitting himself with one of Earl's tracksuits; a deep, rich red tracksuit with white piping. Escape from Louisiana, a bayou ghetto; that's Angela's story. Slim, an outsider, doesn't know the code. ""I'm not your uncle, *****,"" he reprimands him, before they depart on four wheels. The black mechanic(Graylen Bryant Banks), ironically, reflects his customer's own worldview, and refuses to give them a discount, because in the mechanic's eyes, they're not heroes; they're political activist-types who make life harder for straight arrow citizens like himself. He is just as guilty of racial profiling as the dead police officer, with one crucial difference. Officer Reed saw skin color, whereas the mechanic judges Slim and Angela by the clothes on their backs, costumes both, which creates an emotional dissonance for its black separatist impostors, that they never bother explaining to the older man who overcharges them. Junior(Jack Di'Allo Winston), the mechanic' son, buys the undesigned myth of vigilante justice that Slim and Angela inadvertently perpetuates. Before they leave, Slim asks his young admirer to take their picture, a highly-stylized pose the couple strikes, which will inspire Junior to ""Fight the Power"". So Junior decides to fight. He gets active with the activists the next day at a protest rally in Slim and Angela's honor, accidentally discharging Officer Reed's gun on another officer, trying to keep the peace. Law and order, in response, had no choice but to shoot. Junior was armed. Did it matter, though? At the landing strip, they shoot Angela, whose hand was holding another hand, not the trigger of a gun. Law and order had a choice to hold their fire. Law and order gets a second chance to stand down. Slim is armed, with a queen. They shoot him, too, in cold blood.""Queen and Slim"" makes this salient point, which some people will have you believe is a media hoax. Chris Hayes, an author and TV host of ""All In..."" is on-point, when he observes in his best-selling book about race, that one group of people live in a nation, while another group of people lives in a colony. Black people don't choose martyrdom, martyrdom chooses them. They're in on the joke. These people will back law and order, unconditionally, cherry-picking the occasional instance when a police officer has to draw his gun, as proof of your fanaticism about racial equality, as if that belief, a socialist utopian dream, was a bad thing.That's not Slim. That's not Angela. But there they are, memorialized as urban art on the outside wall of a tenement building. The young man who shot Slim and Queen Angela captured an dualistic idea of who they were; heroes on one side, boogeymen on the other.""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend,"" goes the oft-quoted line from John Ford's ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"".Junior shot the legend.""Queen and Slim"" throws down the gauntlet on the state of contemporary race relations.What side are you on?",Queen & Slim

According to this movie, white people are either terrible police officers, stupid southerners, or hillbilly gas station clerks who love guns. Let's all stop being hypocrites here.My biggest complaint is the traffic stop which kicks off the movie. I am a former police officer. I can tell you with 100% certainty, cops like this do not exist. If they do, they are washed out of the job before they are off training. The academy and the FTO process are extremely difficult to pass and it the point of it is to weed people like that out of the job. A few other things: Cops do not use sirens to make traffic stops! They are for emergency stops only. Why do movies/tv shows continue to do this? Cops do not search vehicles for simple traffic offenses. This man had valid paperwork and either would have gotten a ticket or been sent away with a warning. Cops would not pull their weapon for someone saying they are cold. The whole premise was ridiculous.I'm not denying there are issues with law enforcement and the community. This movie had an opportunity to be more realistic than it was. How about a situation where the officer actually is trained to use a weapon ? Portray that and you have something.Okay so after all that, I actually enjoyed this movie. What a great cast. It's beautifully shot. If has a thought provoking ending. It has everything you can want in a movie. Take away the beginning, and I'd rate this 8 or 9 out of 10. Check it out.

A young kid kills a black police officer as a protest of rebellion inspired by their supposed actions, and a trailer trash black man decides to turn them in for $250k reward money - instead of the white couple. Huh? What message does this send except more confusion. But maybe that is the whole point that Society is lost and it's an ethical moral issue that drives the human soul towards rightful acts instead of hatred and violence and it does not matter the color of ones skin.I loved the love story element, music and road trip element and how the lead lady defended her uncle even though he killed her mother as she knew it was an accident.This film will surely be controversial yet the director has a gift so very curious what film comes next.

92,TheCasualReviewer,Daniel Kaluuya is definitely American. He's fooling all of you.,5,23 December 2019,"SYNOPSIS:
While being antagonized and threatened by a racist police officer, in an act of self-defense causes Slim (Daniel Kaluuya) to shoot and kill the officer. This forces both Queen (Jodie Turner-Smith) and Slim to have to leave the city and avoid being imprisoned.REVIEW SUMMARY:
I really wanted to love this film, but unfortunately I did not. I love Kaluuya and Turner-Smith was great in her debut film. The on-screen chemistry was SO good and the direction was fantastic considering it being Melina Matsoukas's debut film as well. I felt the it was the writing that fell really short for me. This is also the debut film for writer Lena Waithe and so I don't want to knock it too hard, but I felt the writing was more focused on saying what it wanted to say rather than being an overall good film. It was a little too on-the-nose and those don't fit right for me. Films like ""Us"" and ""Sorry To Bother You"" were just like this. What this film has to say is very important, it just pains me to see it be told this way. If the film is great, more eyes will see it and that makes it more generally effective. The first 15-minutes were Best Picture worthy and so was the last shot, unfortunately the middle didn't live up to the beginning and end for me.------------------------------------BREAKDOWN--------------------------------------------DIRECTION:
Debut film for Melina Matsoukas and I love what she showed. I haven't seen her work on the multiple music videos she's made, however, I don't think I need to since I genuinely loved the style. It was very clean and shot very well. The problem I did have with the direction, which I really put most of the blame on the writing, is the pacing. The first 15 minutes of this films comes out hot and I swear I thought it was going to be my favorite film of the year at that point, but after that it got reeeaaaalllllyyyy slow. Again, I'll expand more on that later as I feel that was more of the writing, but it can also partially be due to the direction. Some beautiful shots in this film and I'm looking forward to future films from Matsoukas.WRITING:
Many, many flaws. I don't want to dog on it too much as it is the first screenplay from Lena Waithe, so I'll really try to tone it down and be as possibly constructive as I can. Starting off as hot as it did, to then slow down as much as it does, makes it incredible hard to keep attention and be successful. At that point, the dialogue NEEDS to be on point. This is where I really want to stress that I understand what Waithe was trying to do, but it really didn't work for me. Take a film like ""Get Out"". Very much a social commentary and it was delivered flawlessly. I compare this to that, because there commentary wasn't very subtle in ""Get Out"", but it was so real in a way that it didn't feel so on-the-nose. In this film, either character could've broke the fourth wall and told me how they felt about society today and I wouldn't have felt any different. In a non-documentary film, I'm not interested in that. Being subtle goes a long way in this case. It allows the viewer to formulate their own feelings on the subject and really understand where you're coming from. People don't want to be talked at, they want to be talked to and there is a difference. The results are different. For me, not only was this film trying to cram too much into it while masking it with a runaway story, but I felt I was being talked at and in return the film didn't connect well with me. Blindspotting. Go watch Blindspotting and see what I mean with the difference when trying to tell a story such as this one.ACTING:
I love Daniel Kaluuya and I'm sorry, but I'm pretty sure he's fooling all of us in his interviews. I'm pretty sure this man is actually American, cause he has that accent NAILED. He's so good. Not just the accent, but he is so charming in this film. He takes every scene. Bokeem Woodbine does steal a couple scenes as Uncle Earl, but Kaluuya is so amazing in this film. I really hope he gets nominated for this film. I feel he's just as good in this as he is in ""Get Out"" he just had more to do in ""Get Out."" I was also really impressed with Jodie Turner-Smith. Debut film and she was awesome. The chemistry between these two was perfect and that does not go unnoticed. I SO badly wish the writing was there for me cause everything else about this film for me was great. Although, every aspect of this film that I'm going over has debut talent, the writing is the only one I where I could really feel was a first-time project. I don't think anyone will be nominated for this film and it's a shame, but everyone who debuted with this film will have more opportunities to shine, even Lena Waithe and I wish the best to them.",Queen & Slim
93,hotrobinproductions,Would have been better if taken place back in the days,7,12 March 2020,"Solid, but some things just really draw away from the suspense. Like the fact that anyone these characters meet they're going to be ok because the other character is ""black"" and supports them, it gets cheesy and stale as the story continues for me. Also the logic in this film really goes straight out the window. For a main character who is a ""lawyer"" she sure did NOT play her cards right. Literally after the crime with her knowledge of the law she should have called the cops and not leave the crime scene. Literally it was self defense, as was her logic and his, what's the point of running away if it was self defense? Of course the movies reasoning is because the characters are black. It just doesn't work for me because this is not going to affect them, this is NOT Jim Crow law there was footage of proof that it was self defense. I just feel like that is a big mistake and it doesn't work well in this film at all. Good script, solid performances and the cinematography is fine. It's a solid movie but lacks so much logic and characters that try and push the story forward and it works but becomes stale overtime",Queen & Slim

95,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Ride or Die with Queen and Slim,10,7 January 2020,"The Stream: Movie was about 20 minutes too longThe Big Screen: Romantic, relevant, and great performances by the leading actorsThe Final Bill: A must see film that will be an instant classic for the underlying messages and actors' chemistry-S2SHappy Thanksgiving, everyone! And on this joyous occasion of giving thanks and enjoying family and friends, we bring to you a review of Queen and Slim. This film can be described as two people's first date lasting much longer than expected when a police officer pulls them over and the rest becomes a viral and cultural phenomenon. Let's ride with Queen and Slim.Ok, let's get the few bad things out of the way. The movie drug on. I could see at least 15 to 20 minutes of the film that could have been edited to make the movie faster or flow a little better; however, I also could see the director saying the pacing was done on purpose at times. Regardless of that, there is at least one scene in particular that I think could be cut immediately and save the viewer 5 pointless minutes. Finally, you would have to suspend belief to make this movie work. In the time the movie lasts, current day technology makes this a virtual impossibility. There is no way this ride would last as long with the lack of hiding or planning that occurred.Now, for the bevy of positives for Queen and Slim. First, this film is on point, both culturally and in terms of its relevance. From the music/soundtrack to cultural and political climate of our times, Queen and Slim strikes a poignant chord. The soundtrack in itself is so powerful. We ride with them, we cry with them, we get high with them. Few movies this year, I believe, can match or surpass the brilliance put into the film score and sound mixing. This movie would provide the soundtrack of the summer, if the movie came out in May.Next, Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith gave us all of them in this film. Individually, you could feel the love and hurt from each character; however, together at times they were even better. Their chemistry on screen was palpable and truly drove this film. Neither may get the acclaim they deserve from the likes of the Oscars or Golden Globes, but I believe one or both is deserving of a nomination. Let's not forget Uncle Earl. Bokeem Woodbine definitely hijacked a portion of this movie. I could see how snobbier sites wouldn't appreciate, or think his portrayal was necessary or appropriate, but what he brought to this film was truly priceless. I know the audience I viewed this with agrees. One could also say that the writing by Lena Waithe and James Frey gave the cast excellence to work with.Finally, the messages of this movie are quite powerful, and needed as well. I can't say what they are without spoiling the movie, but in the political climate we live, this movie is right on point. Actually, this movie might be late and was needed much sooner. Yet, it's never too late. This movie will spark conversation over the Thanksgiving tables but remember to keep it friendly.Queen and Slim, while a different type of romantic dramedy, rivals and, I believe ultimately, will be associated with the likes of the Love and Basketball, Love Jones, and If Beale Street Could Talk. The performances in the movie and the conversation piece this movie will be makes it worth every dollar in the movie theater. Date night or not, this movie is a fresh box of popcorn.",Queen & Slim

97,helenbassett,Queen & Slim Film Review - Melina Matsoukas Directs Daniel Kaluuya & Jodie Turner-Smith Star In A Road Trip Across America On The Underground Railway,10,12 February 2020,"Melina Matsoukas directs possibly the worst Tinder date in history when Daniel Kaluuya & Jodie Turner-Smith share a not very memorable diner dinner one night. What happens afterwards in Queen & Slim goes down in folklore history, names don't matter on the greatest road trip since Bonnie & Clyde. Except our unexpected heroes are on the Underground Railway to freedom.The stunning Jodie Turner-Smith as Queen is the cool and lonely lawyer who knows her legal rights, Slim is the black guy who knows to co-operate. A botched traffic stop ends in a fatal shooting of a white policeman and a split second decision to make a run for it. With religious Slim not quite convinced, and always wanting to phone his Dad. But Queen blew me away with her abrupt turn from law abiding lawyer to a fugitive on the run. They will otherwise spend the rest of their lives in jail. She does the maths.They decide to make a run for Cuba. The music is great and the rum is cheap. And so snowy Ohio opens out to the sweet sound of New Orleans and Queen's Uncle. He owes her as her first case when called to the Bar was defending him after the death of her mother. His sister. That's family right there. And Bokeem Woodbine's Uncle Earl is so pleased to see them! Of course they need to be a little less conspicuous as the black Bonnie & Clyde, so Earl's house guest Indya Moore lends Queen some clothes. Beyoncé liked the style, and what do you know that track suit Slim is wearing is a dead ringer for her Ivy Park collection. These killers on the run are soo gangster stylish!Winner of the Black Film Critics Awards for Best Original Screenplay, Lena Waithe writes the story of help across the dreamy miles, sometimes unexpectedly with Gregory Keith Grainger. Good for him. And we first realise how the community is looking out for them in a live music bar. The woman serving tells Slim they are among friends there. They are the poster couple for Black Lives Matter. And from this 'second date', the romance starts to build. Slowly because Slim is a noisy eater. And he's shorter than Queen. You know 5 minutes later that night and he would have dropped Queen off and they would have gone their separate ways. Is it luck they they are together or is it their destiny? With both having an opinion. But MFEO? probably not.When the Pontiac Catalina borrowed from Uncle Earl breaks down, a dry mechanic repairs it while his son Jahi Di'Allo Winston's Junior, so excited that Queen & Slim are actually there, takes a photo of them. Proof of their existence. It made the film poster! You could say that Queen and Slim are actually oblivious to what is going on around them, but they are the catalyst for protests and shocking unexpected violence. But there is comedy with a Glock. Daniel Kaluuya's Slim is not really cut out to be a gangster.The pursed lipped Chloë Sevigny with husband Flea provide shelter as Uncle Earl said they would, Mr Shepherd and he served time together. And he is as good as his word hiding them when the local busybody calls the police. But life on the road has to end somewhere as cinematographer Tat Radcliffe rolls us into Florida. The jumping off point to Cuba and just a plane ride away. Rum and salsa freedom a quick hop across the water.And there they are now, metaphysically speaking, as their images adorn the sidewalks of black America. It's funny how I have to consciously write black to describe a character, like in Queen & Slim. And yet normally in films it doesn't really matter as long as the actor tells the story. I described Queen as a lonely lawyer. But Melina Matsoukas's Queen & Slim shows just how far from reality that really is with Black Lives Matter. The fact Queen was black changed everything in a terrifically sad but joyous story.",Queen & Slim
98,Australian1,"All too real in US even now, still...",8,18 February 2020,"....As an Australian, I was, am still deeply upset by the shooting of Justine Damond by Police Officer Noor, when she was obviously unarmed and seeking help.
And that Police mentality is still going strong, shoot first, ask questions after, and not just Black people, but anyone and everyone.The movie has decent sound tracks, I am not a fan, but they were good, the acting is pretty good. Altho I wished for a better outcome.But as far as African/American, when will they find peace, equality in treatment?
I think, threats don't work, militarily or civilly. You can get more with honey.
This movie, fictitious it may be, highlights a struggle which has been going on for decades.
Police training is inadequate as far as I am concerned. That includes Australian Police as well. Too many incidents which took lives that could have been handled better.",Queen & Slim
99,dogonlion,Makes no sense at all!,2,25 November 2020,"This couple is a regular couple with one of them being a lawyer. But throughout the movie they quickly turn into outlaws even trespassing to take a horseback ride. What? People don't change this quickly. Plus they're 2 cop killers on the run. There would have been a state wide massive man hunt on air, land and sea. The dialogs are poorly written. If that was what writing a movie script was, I could do it no problem. The writers don't know if they want this to be a romance, a political statement or a comedy. You can't just put everything in one movie. The only awesome thing in this movie is when the music by Nigerian music legend Fela Kuti started playing 1hr 09 minutes into the movie.",Queen & Slim
100,daviddunn-90653,A Good Story That Never Materialised.,3,28 September 2020,"There was the potential for a good movie here.

101,Vivkon,Blue Bully Bullet,10,13 February 2020,"The movie starts and ends with cruel injustices. The situation of the main characters is provocative. It is about a societal problem, when injustices are perpetrated by people who have been assigned and appointed to enforce and implement justice. The story is hopelessly sad and shows how silence can undermines the truth.The movie splits into two opposing narratives: one is the media representation of events from an official reports (as usual, from local enforcement agencies) and another is based on the common experiential knowledge of the community. Media newsfeed from the screen is refracted through the common perception of the black-police confrontations within the black community. The movie shows two different informational worlds. The storyline provokes sympathy in the main characters. The film provides a bit of advocacy for people who fall victim to the misconduct of public employees.The conclusion of the movie emphasizes the presumption of guilt mainly towards people of color in certain U.S. sectors, whereas the presumption of innocence is the prevailing attitude in the legal system. One mistake of a police officer costs the lives of others. Deliberate misconduct of public employees affects the live of private citizens. The movie speaks up for the silent victims of ""the blue bully bullets"", victims who will never have the opportunity to tell their version of the story.",Queen & Slim
102,On_The_Mark,Could have been much better without being so racist,3,23 April 2020,"Two clearly smart people who happen to be black end up in trouble because of the actions of a racist cop (and their actions of course).As a result, they go on the lam ala Bonnie and Clyde and are the subject of a nationwide manhunt. We're supposed to believe that not only can every single black person in America recognize them, but holds them in high regard because they killed a cop. Even other black cops will help them. All black people hate cops so they regard them as heroes. It's another movie that if a white person made it people would be clamoring RACIST!If you take out the ""every black person hates cops"" thing, it wouldn't have been so bad but it's over the top with this stupidity.Also the woman was supposed to be a lawyer, yet right there in a situation where her skills would be severely needed, knowing everything has been filmed by the camera in the car, she turns into a complete idiot.Not believable. Just stupid.",Queen & Slim
103,mts-91319,Quality Ride or Die flick,7,24 March 2020,"Too many reviews try to claim this is a black Bonnie & Clyde. Not hardly; it is a love story told from an Urban (yes black) perspective. Sadly, it didn't get it's just due. Personally I liked Daniel Kaluuya in this more than Get Out which got better reviews so if you really liked that than you probably won't appreciate him here.Plot was realistic and while many didn't like how citizens rallied behind the couple; I can see how some wanted to tie it into Bonnie & Clyde. Except this couple wasn't committing multiple crimes and seeking acceptance.Ending was no major surprise and told a typical story of America.....but a worthwhile lesson if anyone cares, sigh....",Queen & Slim
104,rustonreviews,A striking debut.,8,23 January 2020,"After a fairly unremarkable Tinder date, Slim (Kaluuya) and Queen (Smith) are ordered by a police officer to pull over after a minor traffic infraction while driving home. Following what was evidently a racial profiling incident, things suddenly take a turn for the worst when the officer draws his gun on Slim. In an act of self-defence, he shoots and kills the officer. Once the officers death is swiftly brought to the widespread attention of the media, Queen and Slim become fugitives from the law and a manhunt ensues for their arrest. On the run and forced to abandon their respective lives, they embark on a journey to begin anew elsewhere, unsure of whom to place their trust in along the way. Described by producer Andrew Coles as 'a love letter to the Black community', Queen & Slim is a striking directorial debut from Melina Matsoukas, driven by two stunningly earnest performances by Kaluuya and Smith.Matsoukas (known primarily for her work as a music video director) directs with confidence and careful attention to detail. Never does Matsoukas shy away from depicting the heavy subject matter addressed in Waithe's masterfully executed screenplay with unflinching realism. Queen & Slim is a film designed to create a dialogue; it tackles racism and police brutality in a way that reflects America's current socio-political climate. A key strength of the film is the strained dynamic between its two Bonnie & Clyde-esque leads. Initially, both Queen and Slim aren't much of compatible match, but as the film progresses and tensions of their journey gradually increase, a genuine love begins to develop between them amidst the heat of their plight. Kaluuya (who has become one of today's most versatile actors since gaining recognition for his role in Jordan Peele's fantastic Get Out) and Smith (in her first feature film role) are absolutely terrific together, and the slow weaving of their blossoming romance is sincere yet largely dominated by a looming sense of hopelessness. Both characters are ultimately flawed, emotionally complex and perfectly realised. Waithe's screenplay is sharp, completely absorbing, and has something crucial to convey in its storytelling. Queen & Slim is a remarkably bold debut by two talented filmmakers. It's powerful, raw, and perhaps most importantly, a painfully relevant exploration of trauma, brutality and love.",Queen & Slim
105,fiftycentqueen,Wow..wow..wow..,10,11 October 2020,I feel like I have been on the run with Queen & Slim watching this movie. This movie should've gotten way more recognition than it did.

Those complaining its not realistic; well it's not a documentary it's a fictional film which is here to entertain and maybe make us think. Personally, though i think it covers racial tension reasonably well, it is the relationship that builds that is the winner here, and the two leads pull that together fantastically well. I would agree, it's ugly long and the pacing is a little slow in the middle, bit overall this is a really well made and interesting movie.",Queen & Slim

Really?!
She being an atheist, then praying? Are you frckn kidding me? To be a Black atheist means you're way past being superstitious to think prayer (talking to yourself) works NOW? LOL
There's no way an attorney would want to remain dressed like a street hooker while on the run, and she certainly would have wanted to fight their unjust case against them.
True Americans know cops have become useless cowards, so why give them the satisfaction of allowing them to do that to them in the end?Last thing... I'm glad a few states have now legalized Shrooms.. for we'll soon see great imaginations putting out real works of arts in music, literature and films again.",Queen & Slim
111,theshanecarr,"Powerful, if not perfect",8,4 April 2021,"A story about two almost-strangers who go on the run after a fatal interaction with a racist police officer making a traffic stop. Something the news has made us all too familiar with.I see lots of comparisons to Bonnie and Clyde and there's certainly some similarities but the context of race, the relative innocence of the central couple, and the love that grows between them makes this a very different movie.Jodie Turner-Smith is great but the magnetism of Daniel Kaluuya is undeniable. He starts off rather quiet but grows in stature as he takes in more and more of what is happening to them. If he wasn't already so firmly on the map with Get Out and Black Panther, this would have made him a star.The visuals are stunning. The evocation of the heat, shine and squalor of parts of the American south are beautifully brought out as our protagonists head that way with a half formed plan to leave the country. The soundtrack by Devonté Hynes is exceptional, powerfully pulling the heartstrings and getting you energised.Unfortunately, the film suffers from its episodic nature. Our central couple bop from place to place, with the focus in each locale on the effect they are having on the next set of people. Despite this slightly repetitive structure, the overall effect is powerful as we gradually discern that Queen and Slim are becoming folk heroes, almost legends to a community for being seen to have taken a stand, but equally are regarded with ambivalence by others.What screenwriter Lena Waithe (who I mostly knew as Aziz Ansari's best friend in Master of None) has done to provide a thread through these situations is foreground the blossoming romance between the two. The passion that grows between them as they go through ordeal after ordeal together is believable and wonderful, and it puts the politics at play elsewhere into perspective; these are just two people who want to live their lives - they never asked for any of this.Waithe admirably wants to show every side to this - the injustice of Black people's lived experience is clear from the outset, but there is a conscious effort to depict Black crime, good white people, and the violence that justified protest can descend into. I think she leaned a little too hard on the ""not all cops"" side. By the time we were on our third decent policeman, I was like ""I get it"".I found the most compelling aspect the depiction of a sort-of unofficial, quasi-underground railroad helping our leads as best they could. It provided a fascinating insight into the sense of a community under siege, united by the injustice they face no matter where exactly they're from.It's hard to divorce the viewing of a film from the context in which you see it, and after the deaths of so many whose names are burned into my mind - Rayshard Brooks, Daniel Prude, Philando Castille, Freddie Gray, Eric Garner, and of course, George Floyd - the issues with which this film is grappling are all too present and real and urgent in our lives. But director Melina Matsoukas (whose debut this is, but who has directed multiple music videos for Beyoncé, Rihanna, and Christina Aquilera) has taken care to craft a suspenseful, engaging movie first and foremost.A movie that's worthwhile for all sort of reasons.",Queen & Slim

116,michaeldoud,First Hit: This film failed to deliver on its potential.,3,10 December 2019,"First Hit: This film failed to deliver on its potential.The potential in this film is to tell the story about how people of color are targeted for police harassment and random shootings. It failed to make this the central and poignant topic and the primary focus of the movie. Instead, it took a compelling beginning and turned it into a story about two people searching for someone who'll love them the way they want to be loved.That's not to say that a love story based on a horrible event isn't unusual, but with our country's problems of race, it seemed like this story had the potential to tell us something about where we've gone wrong. Instead, it became the side story.Slim (Daniel Kaluuya) and Queen (Jodie Turner-Smith) meet on a Tinder date. Their differences are immediately evident as she's well dressed, proper in manners, slow to share personal stuff, and an attorney. He's dressed down more, a bit lazy in table manners, open, and is very close with his family.The conversation at the table is a kind jab and parry type and with a sense of respect. Giving her a ride home, she steals his phone and, in an attempt, to grab it back, Slim yanks the steering wheel and the car swerves.They are stopped by a policeman who is belligerent and pushy in his actions and requests towards Slim. As a lawyer, Queen takes umbrage to the policeman's behavior and talks back to him. She tells him that she's an attorney, and he has no right to be doing what he's doing to Slim. Slim, on the other hand, is compliant and even lets the officer search his trunk. Queen points out that the cop has no cause to do this, a scuffle ignites, the policeman draws his gun, fires, and hits Queen in the leg. Slim knocks the policeman down, the weapon falls loose and Slim picks it up and shoots the officer in the head.The officer dies, and Queen convinces Slim to make a run for it.That's the premise. The rest of the film is about how the black community looks up to these outlaws and their admiration for them standing up to the law. In support, many aid them in escaping the manhunt. They meet up with people who help them along the way and end up finding a connection to fly them out of Florida and on to Cuba where they will live for the rest of their lives. That's the plan.The edge created by the opening scenes is lost as the film drifts off into a love story with their deed becoming a side story and only there to keep them running - together.Kaluuya was alright in this role. It seemed to me that the lost direction in this story took away several possibilities. Turner-Smith was excellent as Queen. Again, the film's story veered away from what could have been a powerful statement. Bokeem Woodbine, as Queen's Uncle Earl, was terrific. His arguments with his live-in girlfriends were amusing. Lena Waithe wrote this mediocre screenplay that ended up focusing on being a love story and not about what brought these two together. Melina Matsoukas did an adequate job of presenting this story and many of the sets and scenes (like hiding under the floor) worked really well.Overall: This film failed to capture my attention to a subject that has been too much part of the news.",Queen & Slim

I feel Q&S tried to do what 'Moonlight' for example did perfectly. It tried to be romantic, scenic, dreamy, intimate and at the same tell a strong story. Yet it failed. I think it's the script that wasn't that good to begin with. And maybe more good ingredients fell on the floor between the flow from script to directing.

122,thetyvonlesure,A Failed Attempt at Social Commentary,6,17 December 2019,"Queen and Slim is a film about two strangers being on the run after killing a police officer in self defense. It stars Jodie Turner-Smith and Daniel Kaluuya, as Angela Johnson and Ernest Hines. Queen and Slim is directed by Melina Matsoukas, and written by Lena Waithe. The cast is fine and the cinematography is well done, however the film is squandered by poor writing and poor direction.The writing in this film is very ignorant and stereotypical. The concept of a black Bonnie and Clyde acting in self defense is a fantastic idea. However, it loses its footing on amateur writing that is incoherent. The people in this film are incredibly ignorant. A coherent story is sacrificed in order to depict each character as hyper realistic contemporary stereotypes. The yearn for social commentary destroys any promise that this film has. Rather than adding something positive to the commentary on police brutality, the film takes an extreme position that encourages hatred and outrage. The film encourages black viewers to kill police without reason, and it encourages the police to hold further fear and disdain toward blacks. Lena Waithe does an awful job of making uplifting, or positive contribution toward police brutality as a social issue.The direction is not there. A lot of the lines are delivered without conviction, or consistency. With direction, these performances could have been much better, as opposed to feeling like a B movie. Perhaps with better direction, the writing could have been fixed during production. Side characters vary from impactful to pointless. A lot of the character decisions are very stupid. It's as if the writer was directing this film, rather than the actual director.The cast lacked direction, however they did their best to work with the material. The film shines cinematically. The camera shots are beautiful and the film is well paced. The plot is initially intriguing and promising, but later squandered by poor writing. The dialogue fluctuates between corny and poetic. The editing is well done. For example, the dubbing of dialogue over sequences in which the characters were mute was very cool. The journey was fun to watch because of the set pieces.Overall, Queen and Slim had so much potential that is lost on a vain attempt to make social commentary. The cast and scenery make the film bearable, despite poor writing that romanticizes police brutality and racism.",Queen & Slim

132,spotboyfilms,Needs a better edit,4,27 November 2019,"This movie is infuriating because it has so much potential. The setup is promising and both actors have enough pull to take you along for the ride. Daniel Kaluuya is a great actor of our times, he carries the screen so well with his eyes and expression. For me, the movie fails in it's editing and pacing, especially past the halfway point. The movie feels about 40 minutes too long. In the beginning, the characters' decision to go on the run feels very haphazard, especially considering Queen's profession. Some of the main character decisions are remarkably dumb and certain other side characters take decisions that are unlike them. Without going into spoilers, all I can say is that this movie is just too slow paced and does not fulfil a promise of what could have been a great fugitive movie with a strong social message.",Queen & Slim
133,jbathie,"Well acted, well worth the time to watch",8,13 March 2020,"I'm white, and I can't imagine what a colored person feels when approached by US law enforcement.This movie, like many others, attempts to bridge that gap letting the viewer see what they feel, and why other support them. Even though it's over the murder of a police officer.Statistically speaking, a white man between 16 and 30 is more likely to be shot by a black police officer than a black man between 16 and 30 is to be shot by a white police officer. Those are undisputed statistics according to the DOJ and FBI. But again, we're expected to believe this story is mainstream and commonplace.As I said, it's well acted, even well cast, but it promulgates a stereotype that isn't true. The #1 killer of black men 16 to 30 are other black men 16 to 30. From 1976 to 2005, 94 percent of black victims were killed by other African Americans. In 2018, where the homicide victim was black, the suspected killer also was 88 percent of the time.Great movie, it entertained me. But anyone looking at this movie as ""this is common"" would be wrong. It's not, in fact it's the polar opposite.",Queen & Slim
134,nyjazzman,Uneven film....,7,7 April 2020,"From the opening incident that catapults Queen and Slim into an unevenly told story, to the final scene, I found quite a bit to admire about the movie. Some sections of the movie were wonderful, other scenes not so much. I would say if the way the story was told was more cohesive, and not so split off in parts, this could've been a great movie.To me, it started out being a film about racial injustice, with a police officer acting in a horrific way, with an incident that I think we all recognize from many news stories that happen frequently. After the opening, the film becomes another movie about the relationship between two very different people, unexpectedly thrown together, and experience personal growth and love for one another.It was good, but fell short of the mark. The acting was very good, so I can't fault their performance. I say watch the movie and appreciate the best parts.",Queen & Slim
135,jenkothetarheel,Why,5,16 December 2019,"Without giving anything away, I just want to say that this is a very frustrating movie to watch. There are multiple scenes that feel unnecessary and unrealistic. There are moments where the characters stop and smell the daisies so to speak when they dont have the time to be doing so. The first 30-45 minutes of the film had me intrigued but after that there were just too many head scratching moments for me to enjoy this film.

139,zwashington-32756,"It Shows The Raw, And The Honest Truth Of What We Go Through.",8,10 September 2020,"""Queen & Slim"" Is A Controversial 2019 Film Of A Modern Day Bonnie & Clyde. The Film Deals With The Issue Of Police Brutality, Its Negative Impact On The Black Community, And Its Massive Impact On Black Youth... When Two Unlikely Lovers Have To Defend Themselves From A Hostile Officer During A Traffic Stop, They Become Infamous Fugitives. Queen & Slim Must Escape To Cuba Before The Life Of Crime Consumes Them... I Thought That The Film Was Powerful. I Love The Film's Heartbreakingly Deep Message. The Story Was As Close To Real As It Gets. Black People Could Be Calm, Compliant, Cooperative, Or Even Crazy And We'd Get The Same Results. I Like That The Story Showed That There Are Corrupt Officers And Those That Are Just Doing Their Jobs. The Story Shows How The Media And Society Go About Handling These Officers, And Vice Versa. Director Melina Matsoukas Did A Fantastic Job Behind The Camera. The Way She Was Able To Build Tension, Suspense, And Several Other Deep Feelings That Our People Are All Too Used To Was Surprising Seeing That This Was Matsoukas's Feature Film Debut. Daniel Kaluuya Was Great As Usual In The Role Of Slim. I Love His Work, And I'm Ready For Him To Give Hollywood A Run For Its Money. As For Jodie Turner-Smith, She Did What She Needed To Do. She Was Beautiful On-Screen, But Her Character Was Iffy For Me. Queen Didn't Make Too Many Great Choices Throughout The Film, And Her Timing Was Often A Bit Sloppy To Say The Least. Queen & Slim Stands Out Amongst A Lot Of Films That Deal With Racial And Social Issues. The Perspective Is What Makes It Interesting. It Gives You A Behind-The-Scenes Look At The Thought Process Of Our People That Corrupt Officers Look At As ""Criminals"". Some Are Just Fighting For Their Lives And That's A Fact. I Think This Film Is Worth The Watch, But I Do Suggest That You Mentally Prepare To Watch It, Because It Does NOT Sugar Coat Anything. It Shows The Raw, And The Honest Truth Of What We Go Through. With That Said, I'll Give ""Queen & Slim"" An 83%",Queen & Slim

I almost forgot that it must be set in modern times, considering attitude of police and multiple cars with no steering lock. I'm a white man, and dealt with police both as subject and as cohorts, and have seen how some can be, and a certain type that is attracted to that line of work, so they always make me nervous when I'm on the other side even just for a traffic stop. I certainly hope and pray that there are not police out there like some portrayed in the film, and hope that there are more like others portrayed in the film. I'm glad they showed that balance, as I've seen it first hand from both sides. Filed a few complaints myself. I think the movie really portrays the sad fact of the feeling that many blacks have endured, but I hope and pray that times have changed more than the movie portrays. I would like to think that nothing like the end would happen in real life as it was obvious they were unarmed.",Queen & Slim

""The Political Statement that needs to die""Apart from the direction, which is a giant mess, the film starts out so slow it is hard to keep your eyes open. We are introduced to two characters that we are meant to feel something for, and the massive exposition drop does not help. We are forcibly thrust into a situation with two characters who are forced to be with each other, incumbent on the police altercation they get in, which, contrary to popular reviewers opinions, does not equal self-defense. There are plotholes so big you can drive a logging truck through them, and nonsensical story beats. The political statement the film aims at is that cops are bad, and if you see them, it's better to kill them than to let them hunt you down. This film comes from a place of hatred and is barely worth mentioning. I wouldn't even recommend it as a rental or a background movie just for taking your mind off things while you do something else.1.5/10",Queen & Slim

At times, the editing was a little inconsistent which caused continuity issues. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith gave fantastic performances. Their characters, Silm and Queen, were believable and well written. The cinematography is fantastically, beautifully shot. How it was shot, it made it an artistic film. I also like the director, Melina Matsoukas, choices throughout the film. Her choices made this film an artistic masterpiece. Lastly, I love the overall message of black, family, culture love.

Parts of it follow the usual tropes of the rom-com, two people who don't like each other that much will eventually fall in love... Other parts are deeply dark, with two people on the run in a desperate attempt to get away.

I have to see this movie again because the last thing I expexted was to constantly shush my mom, as she's rarely that talkative or emotional in a theater, and then I realized...she was attached to Queen and Slim! If characters are willing to do that, especially to my mother, you've done a great job with storytelling my friend.

153,jayjay21718,Queen and slim?,5,1 April 2021,Not sure how the movie even got the name not sure if it was a nickname given to them by the audience who saw the tape or what since it's not their names yet it's referenced to them. So after seeing the trailer I was dying to see this movie. So year a and a half later I finally get the chance to see it. And I am sorry but it wasn't what I expected. Random tindr date. Of people who are clearly opposites. Then she goes through his phone what in the world is right with that. Who would ever do that. Especially if she doesn't plan to date him again anyways. But this leads to them getting pulled over. Why the cop wouldn't call for back up and patrol still didn't send them isn't likely unless he wa s planning to give a warning but based on his previous record dispatch still should of sent one.Then the actions of the women really jsut escalted the situation. But still it leading to gun fire was crazy but. It's what happens next that then I am like why. If she's an excellent lawyer she should know he would of called it in ran his plates and run his name. And then theirs the dash cam. Why run. If you know they will be looking for you and by the dash cam you can see he started it. And at that point it's your two words against him where it clearly shows what happens. Even if theirs sound or not. But by leaving you. Look guilty.Then when they find another officer whose willing to help. Even if they didn't trust him they should of explained the truth to him. So he can let the tigers know which never happened. Then theirs the cop who sleeps with the prostitutes. And comes a knocking cussing them to leave in a hurry and they decide to give them the car in the middle of nowhere. Then they meet a kid that thinks it's ok to jsut shoot police officers. And the fact that he shot what could of been the nicest cop in the world. I was hoping to see him rittled with billetes. His idea of immortality was bad. And by doing what he did I feel he didn't. Go to the riot to support them or to do justice but to make a name for himself.The cop that let them pass because idk because his partner was making him feel bad so he let them go again another officer you could of told the story to.Then to meet some random guy and trust him to take you to the airfield. Because he says i'm sos and so just for him to sell you out. Then the movie decide to do the craziest thing. They kill the girl soem lady whose scared fired a gun and then they continue to yell and to then kill the man saying he's armed and dangerous. When he has a whole person in his arm and there was no one to see that. The dash cams body cams or the later air support no one recorded this. And that none of the cops feel bad about wha they did. I'm not even sure if the movies sole purpose was to show that there are good cops and bad cops. Even though the only good cops they showed were black and the rest of the white cops were either rude or shot. So not sure if it's trying to say only black cops are good. But then they show the black uncle who killed his sister and does drugs and became a pimp. Then she defends him to going to jail which I guess she later bails him out. But then you find the nice white family who the husband is willing to help but the wife is reluctant but still abides. Then they finally jsut get turned over by a black guy in the end so he can get money. For turning them In. Why they were even worth that much was crazy. But I guess again showing that some black people fully supportive calling them panthers or giving them drinks or props. And others like the mechanic were not but then others jsut care about money.I honestly wanted to give the movie a higher rating starting off with the movie. But then with that crazy ending we goign to give it a 6 but by writing this review I was like you know what you get a 5. Since the logic in this movie is so odd. The acting was good some scenes random but. This movie had some potential. That wants seen ultimately.,Queen & Slim

The writer could ask what would be the most realistic way this could happen? That may be more entertaining in some ways.Instead we have things that happen that are symbols for slavery and scenes that show a greater societal issues. They don't always make logical sense and sometimes take us out of the movie.While there are parts that try to give what the characters have done, a fair look at both sides. It still ends up feeling like the director is trying too hard to get us to like them. This feels true about the ending which I personally didn't like.

And that's too bad, because it had so much potential!
The storyline was more romance, than drama.
To be honest, the directors and writers had so much talent to work with, they should've written a better storyline.
It could've been with more emphasis on police vs. blacks without hating so much on the bad bad police. We get it already, white people bad - black people good.

The industry would do a bad thing and a great disservice to black movie goers if they never do a follow up to this movie. The writers of this movie and others like it with horrible endings have a chance to redeem themselves. There must be a SEQUEL a follow up to this movie. it should be called something like Q&S 2 Reloaded. Queen & Slim ""From the Grave"" , or Queen & Slims Revenge. Here is why. the movie ended but that's not the end of the story. ok queen and slim had a hero's home going funeral. Everyone was there. What the casting did right was putting the awesome Bokeem Woodbine in this film. BOKEEM WOODBINE a phenomenal actor he is the key the STAR the HERO of the comeback movie that should be told at the end of 2020. Bokeem goes on the hunt for the CoonSnitch who set up Queen & Slim to be killed. and also kills the white wife of the guy trying to help them finding she also helped get them caught and murdered. Yea the white wife who blamed them for being the reason the black boy killed a cop. which she was way off on that thought. but you could tell she was lost focus. She needs to be found and killed. Bokeem is a phenomenal action actor with military, investigative, martial arts, abilities to exact vengeance on his targets with EMMY AWARD WINNING SKILL.

This film is beautifully crafted whether or not one agrees the two main characters are innocent or guilty. Once queen and slim drive off leaving a dead cop behind, we are made to feel like both parties were in the wrong and what the couple did was dirty and poorly executed no matter what. They were not okay with what they did. Even when others tell them they are heroes for their actions, queen and slim don't feel that way. This made the film so great because you were able to connect with both parties, while still wanting queen and slim to escape and get away safely. The cinematography was absolutely beautiful.

178,jamie-50817,Potential squandered,7,28 July 2021,"Such a great opening - the first 30 minutes are exquisite, and I was completely engrossed. The cast are perfect, the concept is topical and important but not overdone, and the drama feels completely real.Unfortunately it loses its momentum from there. Instead of taut gritty drama that makes you question how you would deal with the situation, you go on a tour of quirky larger-than-life characters, each one carrying a very obvious message. It's like jumping from Taxi Driver to The Help.It's such a shame, because if it had managed to continue what it had started I feel it could have been one of the best trillers of the decade.",Queen & Slim

182,shugal-87579,Beautiful tragedy,10,8 December 2019,"I was in awe of this film, that initially I didn't desire to see because I expected to be so angry. I was still angry but what these two people had to do and how they had to open up to one another and trust one another was beautiful. The faith that began after doubting God, the hope people began to have in them both, and the love that developed between them two was priceless. I felt I looked at love differently and that may seem over the top but it's true. How your heart has the capacity to love is a major point, trusting even when you try hard not to. They both discovered who they really were and the way this story was written and how much it draws you in was just brilliant. Lena Waithe is a force. Must see film",Queen & Slim

It looks just as good as it does on the menu, and tastes decent but COULD be better. Then you get home and start to feel queasy. Then you find out the Chef took liberties with your food to send messages subliminally about their reflections on society. The soundtrack is great but there was a much better way to get across the message. SPOILER ALERT: THE ENDING REVEALS PLOT HOLES.",Queen & Slim

Sucks that movies nowadays always have to force politics and propaganda dividing us and creating more hatred...,Queen & Slim
186,sven-koehler,This is a horrible movie,4,2 January 2020,"The movie begins with some sort of setup. We learn that Slim is a good guy and that Queen is a lawyer who has lost faith in the law, probably?Never mind, in some very unbelievable situation, a cop pulls a gun and shoots Queen in the leg because she asks him for his ID number. The whole situation started when Slim asked the cop to hurry up because it's cold. To finish it, Slim grabs the gun and shoots the cop. Remember, Slim is the good guy: he prays and respect human life, as far as I can tell.Queen, the lawyer, immediately says that they have to run. She knows the law, she saves her uncle from going to prison, and she immediately suggests to run from it. I assume that this is due to some sort of ""the black guy is always guilty"" thinking that they anticipate from the law. Again, Queen prefers to throw away her life and run from the law!But wait, did you know how to rob a store? You give away your gun, that's how.
Also, we witness a black kid shoot a black cop in the face! What is going on!?I know that racism is alive and kicking. I know that there are unjustified killings of black citizens. But the final scene, is just ridiculous.Slim is CARRYING the corpse of Queen towards the cops and they shoot Slim with I don't know how many bullets. Ever heard of a disabling shot? I don't even think Slim was armed!As a European, I don't follow the self praise of the US (have you ever heard of a place called Canada?), but I find this portrayal so unbelievable that I must leave a pretty bad rating. I didn't enjoy the movie and I believed the audience laughed at it several times.This is by no means a fault of the actors. They tried the best they can to get that story across. But it was simply a bad story/screenplay.",Queen & Slim

They knew each other less than a week so the long sex scene was very unnecessary. Cussing every 5 minutes was unnecessary. Queen was annoying and angry most of the movie. Only likable thing about this movie is the chase, and encounters with other characters.
Glad I saw it for free",Queen & Slim
189,raranoff,Good suspense thriller that explores serious questions,8,28 December 2019,Suspense thriller that explores serious questions without being heavy handed.

192,carrythe2,Flawed but its strength drives it through,7,19 October 2020,"A passionate and heartfelt drama with plenty of jeopardy and tension. It does drag in a number of places, particularly in the second half. And there are plenty of unlikely scenarios that dampen its credibility. But ultimately, it has an emotional strength that drives it to the end. The two leads are fantastic.

The lead characters are well crafted and completed by some amazing perfomances by Turner-Smith and Kaluuya, whom chemistry is just of this world and almost speaks like a voice of its own. The cinematography itself was okay (not extraordinary, but still great), I also don't think the movie needed to be this long but damn, if the story doesn't keeps you on edge! I was honestly a bit shocked to see so many people playing the ""leaving 1 star review bc politics"" card considering how character focused the movie is. And it's also far from romantazing the whole ""revenge story"" aspect, actually show how self-served justice, even in desperate time, can sometimes do more harm than good. Great movie, and tbh I'm pretty sure it'd get a easy 8 on IMDB if the background story wasn't about what it's about.",Queen & Slim

199,Belldogg81,A solid effort from two novice film makers.,7,24 May 2020,"Having seen this a few weeks ago, I was a blank slate going into it. Obviously I was familiar with Daniel Kaluuya, from Get Out and Black Panther and had read the film was a first time directorial effort (on this scale) but had no other preconceptions about it.I was pleasantly surprised by just how accomplished it was. The film looks gorgeous. The cast all deliver on what feels like a fairly loose screenplay in keeping with the indie spirit of the film. Yes some plot points feel a little contrived in order to move the story on but nothing so bad that it derails the film.The film very much reminds me of Badlands and to a lesser extent True Romance in its dreamier sequences, as the camera does an expert job of capturing the furtive glances and subconscious body language of the two protagonists deepening relationship. This is aided by an excellent soundtrack and the aforementioned top notch cinematography.Special note to the landscape of Florida itself which as the film moves from the tight, dark confines of the city to the hot, wide open vistas serves as visual metaphor for the journey of the central characters.It's hard enough (in 2020) to view anything outwith the prism of politics, and even harder with a film that touches on the tragedy of the black experience in modern America for some. If even the user reviews here are anything to go by, those of a caucasian persuasion (as i am) feel aggrieved at how white cops are portrayed. Forgetting that there are many incidents of ""malpractice"" every week and that this is a movie. Also there are plenty of films about honest, good police officers.I would urge people to watch the film and see this is not the central point of the film. Nor does it make any strong judgement call one way or another. It simply uses what is a tragically all too common occurrence to light the spark of the story. Then holds up a lens to how that type of incident could play out. No real grandstanding, more a welcome subversion of the fugitive /romance genre from a different perspective.It's a film that doesn't force its message or feel it has to show black people railing against injustice or overt oppression and overcoming all the odds. It just shows two people on the run, trying to survive.As Slim says in one of the film's many great lines. ""Why do black people have to be excellent, why can't we just be ourselves"".",Queen & Slim
200,boldeboy,Poetic Justice But Remastered And Perfected,9,28 November 2019,"I don't normally rush to the movies to see something on its opening night, normally I wait until Friday haha. But, this movie was calling me ever since I first saw the previews for it. I honestly didn't have the highest expectations for it either. I am a black male here in America. I have been pulled over by police before and felt that many of the interactions were handled unprofessionally and in a uncivilized manner. I do know that often movies told through this lens don't do US, black people, any justice. This movie sets its self apart though.
I won't go into a movie play by play. Someone else will I'm sure. I will say that this movies has substance, character, identity. It's thought provoking and creates dialogue as your watching it. Your literally speaking out loud on how you feel as you sit in the theater. It's that compelling when it comes to getting your attention.
There's no action packed effects or moments that leave you scratching your head about the directors approach. The creator of this is the same person from the tv series. The Chi on showtime. It's like she listens to her people and projects it back into her work. You laugh with the couple Queen and Slim, your angry with them, cry with them, and most importantly, live with them. This movie is what black love should look like. If you could imagine two slaves running from a plantation back in the day. All they have is one another. Surrounded by a community of conflicted people. This is today's Poetic Justice. It's a movie I will keep in my mind and heart. It's worth watching a few times. If I was to say anything bad about the movie, it'd be that there was some moments that made me clap and I'm not sure everyone else might of enjoyed me doing so lol. Go see it!",Queen & Slim
201,holcombes-87981,Wow. Just wow.,8,8 December 2019,"Throughout my time watching Queen and Slim, I found myself holding my breath in terror for this poor couple. I felt so emotionally invested in them. The plot, acting, and story progression are all phenomenal. It truly provides a new perspective for so many people and makes clear the true horrors of what is happening in our country.The only thing I didn't really enjoy about this movie is the aspect of people talking but not moving their mouths. This happens periodically throughout the film but there isn't an indication that it's a past conversation or anything. It feels random and misplaced. Aside from that, I have no qualms with this movie whatsoever.",Queen & Slim
202,rmailander,Commmendable and forceful debut for visionary director Melina Matsoukas,8,22 March 2020,"The plot line of Queen & Slim is fairly simplistic. Two people who met on the dating app Tindr go to a late night dinner at a local diner. On the way to their respective locations from said diner they are pulled over by a trigger happy police officer who goes to extreme measures to demand their complicity in his minor traffic infraction pulling over efforts. When things go too far said cop ends up dead at the hands of our hero. What happens next is an arsenal of some very eclectic characters making brief; but impressionable, turns in their lives on the run from the law. The main characters are well etched and have enough enigma surrounding them to ensure that you don't view them as only people at their current state. The same cannot be said of the supporting players. While Bookeem Woodbine and Benito Martinez both turn in passable performances as the player past his prime uncle of our heroine and an empathetic sheriff who ends up getting a raw deal respectively; neither one gets enough time to sensibly develop either character. We aren't even told what happened ot Martinez at the end of the film. These minor infractions are not enough to bash this film on any level. The cinematography is breathtaking, the interactions between people (especially civilian and authority) are eerily prescient. The film appears to be motivated by its social message; not made to exploit it. The ending is gripping to say the least and the senses of hope and dread that bob around throughout the film give it a roller coaster feel; something rare to find in films that are not symbolic of the thriller, suspense, or horror genres. Matsoukas shows guts and gusto when handling her cast and relative newcomer Jodie Turner-Smith (in her first lead role) is astonishingly naturalistic as the strong-minded Queen. David Kaluuya has a vulnerable sensibility about him that allows you to see the winces of pain his character feels as he begins to understand that his life is irrevocably changed in ways he dare not attempt to comprehend. The film also features small performances from Chloe Sevigny, Flea,and Sturgill Simpson. Impressive child actors are put on display in pivotal supporting roles; notably Jahi Di'Allo Winston as the socially conscious son of a conservative mechanic.",Queen & Slim
203,retsamyar,hard to finish,2,17 January 2020,While a good crime fugitive drama is great every once in a while this one was off the mark. The poor writing and editing in tv and movies needs to stop. It is not that hard to make it even some what believable. It is not unheard of for police to be shot and people to run from prosecution. I for one do not understand how one can be so lazy. I would assume if you are in the business of making these things it is a life long dream to be working in that field. But is it laziness or the lack of respect for the audience? Why put any real effort into it if the audience is just closed minded stupid people who will believe anything? It is hard to tell sometimes. I really hope its not for the lack of respect for the audience. Although it surely feels that is what is happening in modern entertainment media. Or maybe I am the one making the poor choices to begin with and there isn't an ever expanding selection of garbage media to choose from. Like everything its somewhere in the middle I suppose. I would not watch this movie again nor tell a friend to.,Queen & Slim
204,wyates-65861,Almost 10 stars,7,9 June 2020,"The movie was good, but in my opinion I would have enjoyed it better with less irony (don't like life imitating art). Screenplay that I didn't enjoy: (1) black kid with a gun shooting a Police Officer (2) Queen & Slim's fugitive film-long journey just to get gunned down by Police unjustly and with impunity (3) back-stabbing black guy working with the police to betray Queen & Slim for reward bounty. I understand the message in the movie, I am a black American man, I already know and live the meaning of the movie and the realism in the message of the movie, but I like seeing the good guys ride in the sunset and the double-crossers get disappointed in their scheme.",Queen & Slim

211,clfigueroa,Excellent film specially in these times.,8,24 June 2020,"I read some of these reviews and I wonder what movie people thought they were watching. And I felt the pace of the movie was good. They needed time to build their plan and also time to develop chemistry as this fiasco starter on one date. The film kept me engaged. A few minor scenes could have been cut to shave maybe 10-15 mins but I was fine with it. And the film was realistic specially with the ending. It's well worth the watch, ignore the haters who are just mad about the premise and enjoy it for yourself.",Queen & Slim

214,mitchellsterlace,8.3 could have been an easy 8.6 but.....,8,29 November 2019,"If this movie had a different end it would have grabbed a maybe nine stars out of ten. If i could use a decimal point at this moment it would be around an 8.3 with a better and more satisfying ending it would easily be at least an 8.6 or higher. The runtime on this movie doesn't feel over stayed or to long but because of the ending it becomes almost frustrating. You watch two very enjoyable and well developed hours waiting for that solid message and conclusion. Right here so many sub meanings many of which are negatives are being fleshed out to bring positives but the positives are scarce. It made me walk out saying it was a very interesting and creatively shot film, but that ending made it all feel pointless.
I love seeing artists at work making their craft the camera angles, direction, design both set and costumes along with the writing. This film is beautiful, heartbreaking, funny, relatable, very unrelatable(in a good way) but the ending makes it all feel wasted in the moment. However, still great in so many ways and most likely could have been a big Oscar grab. You have to Love seeing young actors and also strong female directors making such high thought provoking material.",Queen & Slim
215,watcheda,Not in the first place,4,3 May 2020,"I had a thought after watched a few minutes, there is something not right about one of the character, mostly when the shot happened. Queen as in the character, as an attoreney with that kind of attitude? I'll saya to no.The first mistakes, it's kind of rushed decission being made by an attorney. There's no panic gestured at all, it's like Queen get used to shot somebody and run (hit and run), that's the first mistakes.The ending?I can guessed how it's end and I was 100% right, when they tried to get on the plane, and like a magic, the cops/sherif coming (not for long) then the final ending they both died being shooted by the sherrif. This kind of script liike an old school movies. I just fast forward and fast forward, mostly when their getting help with a person to a person to the person friend that got a plane, and his not got any planes actually then he has a friend that has a plane. God, it's like childplay. Amovie that not worth watch over and over again.",Queen & Slim

222,sdlvgirl,I wanted to like it,3,4 September 2020,"Very slow paced. The female lead is annoying. There is only one way this story can end. I bet you can guess the ending from the description of the movie. I find it nonsensical and short sided that these two were made out to be heroes. Don't get me wrong, I had hoped they would've made it. The last scene shows a picture of the two being made into a mural on the side of a building. What?? They were not heroes.

There is so much chemistry between them I found myself hanging on every movement, every gesture, every word. And that's part of the problem, the ""word"" part. I like the snazzy dialogue that flows-eloquently at times-from these charismatic reluctance lovers as long as it's conversation. The ultimate story it tells once it's connected to a series of events is more stereotype than story-and so are many of the other characters-unfortunately. It's not the fault of the acting or the direction; which is consistently A+. Nope, the writing let them down. I would just like to say I hope these two lead actors work together again on a better written movie. They truly are the best Hollywood has to offer today. I haven't seen this kind of chemistry in a long time and I see everything that comes out. I still recommend seeing this movie flawed story and all.",Queen & Slim

I know I have seen it and didn't think it was worth its price of admission, but why would you take the time to criticize the ratings that others have given it?Have we reached that point as a society in which we don't even respect the opinions of others?

Very well acted, a very simple story but almost every character is so well developed. Beautiful acting by Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith in the title roles and some good, though small, supporting cast. You can take whatever political message you want out of it but eventually you'll be ""caught up"" in the tale as it unfolds. Probably a tad bit too long, especially in the second half.",Queen & Slim

However no matter how much I look past it they're constantly shoving the 'all police bad' mentality, they could have done the story without it and it would be all the better for it, and if you really needed to input that message into the story I get it, just don't make it so that's the only reason why you made the movie.

Suffice to say that there's way too much going on, the plot sacrifices breadth for depth. I personally found it difficult to care about the lead characters which is interesting given they are on the screen 80% of the time. Too much B roll of cars and landscapes as well. In the end, it just feels like the director or scriptwriter simply did not know where they were going with it (was it an overt social commentary? An unlikely but thrilling adventure? A love story?).Overall, just disappointing. Was hoping for something fresh but left feeling meh.",Queen & Slim

I found the cinematography to set the pace of the movie so well, and damn, the soundtrack was the beating heart of this movie.The acting was superb, i grew to care about both of them.Too many reviewers are focusing on some political message.. I don't think this movie was about that at all, the police shooting was a plot device to show how love can blossom in the most unlikely of circumstances.

Sure, it isn't a perfect movie & there are plot holes, but it's a movie. It isn't intended to reenact a true story.
It's intended to connect with people who understand it and that it absolutely absolutely does.I didn't like some of the choices they made, especially in the beginning but reading some of the reviews of ppl who have a major problem with that, I wonder how perfect their life choices must've been up until this point? The whole point is that they made mistakes just like any of us are liable to do in different areas of our lives.

Unfortunately I found myself laughing and cringing through most of it. Numerous times I found it predictable. The only savings grace for this movie was it's good soundtrack, cinematography and acting. Some scenes felt forced and added just for cosmetic purposes and added no real value to the story. There were too many unrealistic moments that ruined this movie for me. If you decide to do this type of story and engage in social issues, it must feel real!",Queen & Slim

264,BlackDynamite243,Flawless,10,30 November 2019,"This movie is a beautiful work of art, a true motion picture. It addresses the way in which love within and for the culture transcends our individual issues, challenges and worries. They honored black life with a disregard for their individuality which pushed them into a love that only springs from contemplating life and death, from being hunted like dogs. They took fear and made it into faith. This writer and director made a portrait out of a landscape. The cinematography was purposeful, the pace and each scene was purposeful. The dialogue and connection between the characters queen and slim as well as between them and the community was artistic. Slowing down the process was a necessary device to build anticipation while appreciating each moment. I would say, for those that truly pay attention and absorb this piece, they will find this to be one of the best movies about love and legacy that has been made to date. I am going to see this as many times as is possible. And I will be preordering this film the second it is made available to do so.",Queen & Slim
265,larryl-82383,PLEASE SEE THE TRUTH!,1,2 December 2019,"QUEEN & SLIM - R (for violence, some strong sexuality, nudity, pervasive language, and brief drug use) LARRY'S MOVIE REVIEWS....- After watching the previews for weeks, I was excited to see this film sort of a modern take off of a Black- Bonnie and Clyde.
Queen and Slim, who are never actually called that in the movie, are Earnest (Daniel Kaluuya), a Costco cashier with easy attitude, and Angela (Jodie Turner-Smith), an attorney cognizant of every racial micro-aggression. she took a Tinder date with Earnest because she didn't feel like being alone, it's an awkward date, and they aren't really a good match. She asks for a ride home, but when a traffic stop goes as badly as most movie traffic stops of black people by obnoxious cops tend to go, they're forced to stick together, I was happy to see that it was not about RACE, or so I thought because the cop was dumb and shot first, and it was an accident he was shot.
This was an absorbing, empathetic, heart racing introduction with charm, that fell off a cliff soon after and NEVER climbed back up. They made no plans, and when they had opportunities, they made idiot decisions. - Let me NOT boor you, as I was with the movie, but give you one scene that make me almost walk out early on! Ernest goes into a small gas station, in hick-ville, shows the young man behind the counter he has a gun and wants $40 of gas. The (white) hick- Counter attendant with long hair says he will not let him steal the gas unless he gets to see and hold Ernest's gun, that Earnest stole from the cop he shot. Earnest and Angela are all over the news and news papers as Cop Killers, and on the papers in the store. So they argue briefly and Earnest gives the attendant the gun, WHAT???!!! Earnest does NOT even take the bullet clip out!!?- The attendant points it around and seems passionately mesmerized by the gun, finally pointing at Earnest he says he knows how he is, ""the Cop Killer"" and a reward is out for him. Earnest beggs for the gun back and pleads to steal the gas, AND THE ATTENDANT GIVES THE GUN BACK IT TO HIM!!!? I got up to walk out! I had to yell ""please this is stupid"" in the theater, and the couple behind me laughed and said yes. - So I made it through the rest of the film with other idiotic, non-realistic impossibilities, that made me shake my head further. This film gets a D not an F, because the actors were good with one of the worst scripts ever written, I felt sorry for them. Save yourself time, and your sanity, this film SUX!! Paint your house, fix the fence, whatever you do its better than sitting through this!",Queen & Slim
266,kelseyhinton-23085,TOO PREDICTABLE,3,10 February 2020,"I was soooooo disappointed in this film and the quality of it and extremely happy that I didn't waste money to go see it in theaters.

268,ubergarbage,Not Good,2,7 July 2020,"After watching a great trailer I was excited to watch this. But very quickly while watching the movie I was shocked at how many 'why the hell are they doing that' moments there are.

Then one of them, which happens to be a lawyer, decides they should flee the scene even they they had no weapon or motive to kill the cop, other than self defense. And it just keeps being horrible from there...",Queen & Slim
273,godisgoodyesheis,Movie envelopes you like a warm blanket,10,2 January 2020,This movie centers the black experience in the US in a way that is rewardingly refreshing. It is a story about how people can be surprisingly dynamic and unpredictable. It's also about how people respond when situations force them to be their true selves. The movie explores what it means to be naked and takes what comes while in that state. The movie's treatment of legacy was essential. Legacy needs to come solely from the heart without any influence from external pressures. That's when legacy is beautiful and unrestrained. By movie's end I wanted more.,Queen & Slim
274,hardik0117,"As a movie, it wasn't that good",4,28 November 2019,"The opening sequence is mind bogglingly great. It's also mostly shown in the trailer. After that, the movie doesn't know what it wants to do. A plethora of confused dialogue coupled with amazing performances by the two leads make for a tolerable hour of entertainment.
It didn't help that Queen's character was inherently unlikeable.
As a statement, the movie almost failed to live up to it's promise, until in a shockingly predictable moment, it shook me. It legitimately made me have a physical reaction to the scene on screen.",Queen & Slim
275,subliminal-minded,Black LOVEs Matters,9,1 December 2019,"Yes, police brutality (and the subsequent retaliation against the cop) is the main selling point of this film, but it is much more than that. If you love to explore nuance, then this film lends itself to that craving.I read a review that accused this film of defiantly negating romantic affection between a Black man and woman, by way of the presence of White oppression. To that criticism, I say.... pay closer attention to the love, physical and emotional, that transpired between Queen and Slim. We're so used to seeing Black couples at each other's throats, that some folks can't recognize the beauty in the love-making montage in this film. Not harsh, coarse intercourse. But a truly heart-syncopated rhythmic scene with passion. And in regards to the collective love, we see Queen and Slim protected by a hive of adoration and dignity. The juke joint scene, where we see a live blues band and patrons old enough to appreciate the southern tradition, extended a solidarity that's missing in today's hip hop culture. Not to mention the hilarious scenes of warmth when Queen enlists the help of her uncle, played by the rejuvenating Bokeem Woodbine.The visual poetry is breathtaking, and commands your attention, as the scenery beckons that you recognize it as it's own character. The journey of this duo is more than what is happening around them. The journey is also about what is happening INSIDE them. The undeniably measured growth of Queen comes to a boiling crescendo at the film's fatal climax. You can't help but sympathize with her, as she endured so many transitions in just a few days. And boy, does her body take quite the hit. A true testament to the unyielding spirit of Black women.The small detours and many supporters that they encounter are all worth it. There isn't a single scene or anecdote that feels unnecessary, in my opinion. Everything has a purpose in this film. Even the unfortunate circumstances that follow. The people complaining about how ""slow"" this movie is, haven't attempted to dive into the ethos of Queen and Slim. Every subtle quirk and joyous moment isn't taken for granted.A road trip? Sure. A cautionary tale of two unfortunate souls that are seeking refuge? Ofcourse. But take the time to relish in the beauty that this film wants to convey, instead of lambasting the heavily nuanced cop-killing scene.",Queen & Slim

282,ChipsQueso,Thelma & Louise meets Easy Rider,9,28 August 2020,"Being confined on a road trip for an extended period is oddly liberating. Devoid of the infinite mediums of entertainment and mere asphalt beyond the horizon, those you share such moments with will reveal an individual stripped of inhibitions. Add a backdrop of being a fugitive on the run and the ante is turned to eleven. Queen & Slim is such an endeavor.Our protagonists are never formally introduced because they could be anyone, and yet they seem familiar. An overachiever whose incessant strive for professional excellence is left personally unfulfilled, accompanied by a purposefully naive plebeian who accommodates the everyday struggle with optimism. Two halves of a whole whose traits color the palate of humanity.The movie opens with Queen and Slim's first date. Rather than the cliche love at first site, this becomes an arranged marriage when the two are pulled over on their way home. Culminating in the cop's death in self defense, Q&S decide to run. Along the way, they curry the favor of a band of misfits: estranged family, friend's of friends, and complete strangers. Unbeknownst to our main characters, a legacy is building in their wake as symbols of a movement they didn't intend to spark. Akin to the heirloom pinky ring you feel was stolen, their legacy is prematurely smoldered.More art than film, the movie is aesthetically beautiful, perfectly soundtracked and skillfully written. The dialogue may seem sparse, yet doing so empowers what is spoken. Like any good road trip, the moments in between the playlist are when you discover the person lying beneath the surface.Regardless of their first impressions of one another, their forced confinement enriches a relationship that would have otherwise been left unkindled. How often do we indulge first impressions and shy away from any sign of discomfort? Modern society is enshrined in planned obsolescence as we rely on the convenience of discard and replace. The enormity of life on Earth may allow life to seem disposable, yet if there is no struggle there is no progress. Our characters discover such enlightenment acknowledging the simplistic need in a ride or die to hold their hand.A timely movie for the moment our country is currently a witness. Despite the beauty of the landscape they traverse, there is an ugly history composting in its soil. Queen, a practicing lawyer who acquitted her uncle from the death of her mother knowing it was not of ill intent, tragically is the one who suggests they run from their trouble knowing the optics were not in their favor. A threat to society, presumed armed and dangerous with empty hands. Justice is not blind and this movie does a service by showing us what many don't want to see.",Queen & Slim

284,bellboy5,"Solid premise, but goes off the rails",2,10 December 2019,"Some people here are saying their will be haters because of the political message. I think the film will get more credit than it deserves because of the message.It starts promising with a tinder date gone horribly wrong (although it feels that the events were staged intentionally for it to go wrong ... as does much of the rest of the film).What ensues tries very hard to be a love story, a tale of redemption, an episodic journey and a political revelation ... but it all gets jumbled in a series of questionable decisions and actions and characters that never quite reveal depth.I was invested with the characters at the beginning, even with their bad judgement, but at some point I said out loud ""if he gets on that horse, I'm done with this film."" We continue with a series of events that clumsily attempt to reveal the humanity of the characters, but leave the audience asking ""why the hell are they doing that? Especially now?""I wanted to like the film after seeing the trailer, but it is ultimately weighed down by its own self-indulgence, culminating in scene after scene continuing to hammer home the point when the film should have ended long before.

So you want a scene where a young kid shoots a cop? Well how about building up to it as part of the story and making it a meaningful part of the plot? Maybe the cops violently arrest his dad in front of him, he panics, grabs a gun? Or maybe previously the kid witnesses something violent or is a victim of police brutality? Naah have him just go for a nice walk with the protagonists and then a bit later he just walks up to a cop and shoots him!? What? Utter nonsense. The character arcs don't make sense. Scenes are just played out without consideration for story.

I went see it for the talented actor and actress alone in the lead roles. If someone rated this movie a 1 or a 10, they have seen neither a 1 or 10 movie because this was neither or they are trying to affect the overall rating. It's well made and well acted.

The idea of combining a romantic road movie with an exciting ""on the run"" movie and at the same time deliver a political message is a challenge to start with. This requires excellent writing skills as well as good chemistry between the lead characters. These are all missing. The lines of the female lead fall flat. It is impossible to explain the stupid and illogical actions of both lead characters. There are way too many slow scenes and unnecessary dialogs that make this boring to watch.",Queen & Slim

302,nolagwagonfx,Get busy living or get busy dying,8,7 March 2021,"The most beautiful concept in this movie is persistent throughout - and also a reason many have complained about it.The two main characters are on the run from the law, but stop to experience life along the way - and this makes some viewers scream ""WHY are you being so risky, you can easily get caught!?""...The thing is, that's part of the beauty of what's happening. They both know that their chances to survive and live any type of life is slim (no pun), BUT at the same time feel a sliver of hope they can make it free....So this puts them in a predicament: do we zoom on down trying to be inconspicuous - or try to enjoy life's little moments of bliss - because we can be caught/killed at any moment.As the movie goes on there's sort of this idea that's conveyed - that the 2 main characters come to a realization like 'you know what, maybe we won't make it, and that's okay, we've found love, experienced new joys, and did the best we could , in the face of death.'So again if you would possibly have your life or freedom taken from you, would you stop and smell the roses?

The movie itself is pretty great and I'd highly recommend you go see it when it comes out. The acting is very strong, the directing feels very fresh/unique, and you really grow to care about the film's romance. The political statements this movie makes are secondary to the story of these well-fleshed out characters and their struggles, which makes the commentary resonate stronger than many other movies like this. It ain't perfect --it's a bit long, especially when considering the repetitive structure of the story, and the shot composition is a bit boring  but this is a movie that everyone should go and see.

But the movie has no plot or message. It doesn't condemn or condone the murder of the officer. It doesn't condemn or condone a lawyer giving the worst possible advice at every turn. It is a well acted film that tries to be something but ends up being nothing due to a horrible script.Many try to make it out to be a statement piece against police violence.

309,mailbarbustefan,Is this movie legal ?!!!,1,27 February 2020,"I would place this movie in the SF category ... S for stupid, F for filth.The story is absurde: a policeman doing his duty, is provoked by the two individuals with mental problems in understanding to comply to a routine control, the two verbally assault, and attack the police officer, steal his weapon and kill him in cold blood...and, all of these, with no reason at all !!!
Following is a series of scenes that are unlikely to happen in reality, some aberrations like these: ... the murder of a police officer by a child, in the middle of a crowded street ... a hiding place under the floor, under the bed ... the jump of the actress,from the second floor, when both her boots jump off her legs(!!!) (is something like this ever possible to happen...EVER? !!!:))... ) ... the cop who, whilst in the middle of the street, hears an inaudible scream coming from a garage with closed doors, 100 yards away, behind a house, finds the two cop killers and let them run away ... and all the other scenes, detached from any logic and reality, which follow one another after another after another...I understood that the film wants to be an raging instigation of black people against white people but, with such a poorly made film, I doubt that someone will trust and follow the message issued by it.I am alarmed to see that, nowadays, there are still people with such a lower level of intelligence who can conceive such a mess of a scenario that they would stage so badly from the point of view of the (ridiculous) interpretation of the main actors and from the technical point of view (image and sound editing).",Queen & Slim

Honestly sad that this film was made, it shows just how far people will go to fuel their victim complex and turn the black community against an organisation that is doing nothing but trying to help and keep people safe, films like this are inciting violence towards police, one scene in particular endorses and encourages murdering police officers with no provocation.",Queen & Slim

One major issue I noticed once it hit the halfway point was how slow the pacing was. It just started to drag a lot and added some unnecessary scenes. Also most of the decisions the characters in the film made make no sense whatsoever. However Daniel Kaluuya gave a great performance as this character as well as Jodie Turner-Smith in her role. This movie is no where near flawless but it is definitely enjoyable and worth the watch. It's a 7/10 from me!,Queen & Slim

Who would make a movie like this? What upsets me the most is how this movie was marketed like a strong black movie, and then then just like today unarmed black people are gunned down, and no justice ever. Wake up black people, is someone trying to show us this is what happens when we stand for something or what's right. I hated to even rate this a 1, it was only done to say this .",Queen & Slim

The everyday perspective and experience of the Black Woman and Black Man in dealings with the police in American society, especially those of deep pigment such as Queen & Slim (it's no coincidence they were dark skinned) is unfortunately something that very few understand or identify with unless they are of the same background or have decided to remove the vail of ""the officer is always right"" from their eyes. This story is not entertaining, it is not funny, it is not enjoyable, this story is REAL. Queen and Slim are a composition of so many men and women whose voices were silenced. Their decisions and actions depict a marriage of fear, strength, and love all intermingled together in a circumstance that is not at all far fetched. To dislike this movie is to not understand this movie.",Queen & Slim

I love how the characters developed from beginning to end and how we see different stages in the characters life. As a wannabe playwright, I must say the writing and the dialogues were exceptional. My only minor complaint was the delivery of the dialogues but other than that, the perfect adventurous movie.",Queen & Slim
328,dinahs_4,Beautifully moved,10,1 December 2019,"Going into the movie the police stop would've realistically ended with 2 shot and 1 person walking away free again. This time the tables turn and we have a hurt, broken (rightfully so) black woman together with an innocent naive black man, leading him down a path that she knows will end in death, and he eventually reaches that same conclusion.
As the the film moves on, you realize she needs this adventure and connection to another human being and her past to reconcile who she is. The silly delays of the 2nd date, riding a horse and running out of gas twice reminds you that these are not career criminals, but 2 humans trying to find a way out of a situation that can never be. Literally living everyday like it's their last.
The support they received along the way is uplifting and the end is beautiful and heartbreaking. This parallels the Joker in that a faction of society that is forgotten and devalued can gravitate and uplift that which will give them a voice.
The movie does do a great job at getting you connected with the characters however it did give me unreasonable hope and anxiety considering they're doomed from the start.
When we see the waitress deliver the food to Queen and Slim you just assume it's a normal regular movie but the minute Queen opens her mouth to Slim from that moment on it's pure reality and I love it, its literally today's world and I had a good time seeing it. It's the perfect date movie for today's generation, it's kind of like Do The Right Thing for this generation.The only disappointing part was how they put their trust into a nut who lived in a trailer to get them on a plane to Cuba. Like they really thought a dude who was living in a trailer park knew the plug.
I definitely recommend seeing this moving, it will surely stay on your mind and heart.",Queen & Slim

5) some kid they met along the way goes crazy but then they never show you what happens after or really before
6) the movie makes it seem like all black people are violent and have broken pasts
7) pimp stereotypes, weed smoking, black people turning on each other, gold teeth, rude comments from caucasian characters reflecting today's time, black people not knowing their rights and dumb characters, black on black crime, black kids playing basketball like that's all they do.

334,silkbrace,Moved to Tears,8,8 December 2019,"I'm not much of a movie critic, but I definitely loved this movie. It's annoying that people review bombed the movie without actually watching it. Sure, it's a bit slow paced and some scenes have a repetitive feel to them, but you grow to fall in love with the romance built up between the two protagonists. The slow pacing was hardly a problem when you're so entranced with the chemistry between the two actors. Amazing character development. The soundtracks were perfectly placed throughout the film as well. Very fitting and consistent with the tone of the movie. My friend and I vibed pretty hard with some songs. Some may be initially put off by the political aspect in the movie, but nevertheless the movie provides multiple personal viewpoints on systemic injustice. It allows the audience to not only empathize with the protagonists, but with how some other characters in the film responded to the movie's main conflict. I cried a b**** at the end. Highly recommend checking this movie out.",Queen & Slim

Black & Blue preached the exact same message. Racism is alive and well; & all white cops are trigger-happy bigot murderers. Sigh. You don't leave a movie like this thinking of how we need to be nicer & more respectful of each other. Not at all. Instead, black people (clearly the intended audience) leave feeling angry all over again at white people.
For a movie wanting to speak up about racism, it really does nothing but add fuel to the fire.

342,indexthakid,"U man are crazy, this movie is sick",10,21 February 2020,"I would like to start off by saying this movie is not racist, nor is it talking about ""old school "" rasist stereotypes. I feel like a lot of people that have these thing to say about this movie are either not in-touch to what is happening in this day and age (which in some cases is no fault of their own but there is enough information out there to read up on these thingS) or so blinded by ignorance that they can't give things a chance. THIS BEING SAID in no way am i condoning ""shooting police"" and i feel like a lot of people think the message of the movie was to band together and rise up against the 'white police officers as they are evil'. No. Put your privilege down for 5 minutes and understand that 1) they knew that regardless if they stayed or ran they would die. This story was more about the time inbetween and how much freedom they had even though they were outrunning confinement. She was an attorney FFS of course she knew what would happen to them in court even if the video showed that it was self defence 2) the kid they met on the way was a perfect example of the otherside of things...a lot of people preempt possible racial profiling with agression , maybe from previous problems or maybe not but this shows this ins't the way to go about it not everyone is racist and not every black person thinks all police are racist. And not all police racially profile. This is why the police officer that told the boy to go home was Black. This is why out of the whole movie only ONE police officer was ""racist"" and the others were doing their job bro. But why Complain if you're going to watch the movie and not take anything from it? Anyways rant over this movie exceeded my expectations, the direction editing and emotive control throughout this whole movie was incredible definitely worth a watch...with and open mind lol",Queen & Slim
343,mirellarose,Realistic.,7,1 March 2020,"I notice everyone was giving this movie a couple stars if even. It took me a minute to watch this movie because of how everyone were saying it was slow, wasn't that good, and I just went off of that and didn't even try to find out for myself. I regret not doing that. This is a GREAT movie. Very realistic and I was interested in every second of the movie. I don't understand what more people wanted.. more action? This isn't that type of movie. I feel like the actors portrayed their roles excellently and everything fit. It did make me antsy because it was like you never knew when they were going to get caught and if they even were going to get caught so I feel like it really made you follow along because not only were you eager to know their plans and what steps they were going to take, you were also rooting for them and hoping that they make all the right decisions. So I definitely feel like this was a great movie, the director excelled in her job , the actors made a connection with the viewers and the story line was REALISTIC which matters in this type of movie. The only reason I gave it a 7 stars is because it was kind of slow paced which is not always bad but it did make me anxious and 2, it's rare I give movies a 10. But other than that is was a GREAT movie I loved it, would I watch it again? Hm, maybe sure I would definitely give it some time before I do though.",Queen & Slim
344,playboikevin,Y'all crazy,9,11 March 2020,First off I see way too many Bonnie and Clyde comments. They only killed one person throughout the whole movie and that was the police officer in the beginning. Bonnie and Clyde went on a rampage murdering people and robbing places. All Queen and slim wanted to do was prove their innocence and how messed up cops were. I can see what was going on but they didn't have to get lit up like that in the end that was sad. Trigger happy cop shoots queen then next thing you know slim is showing them what they did and just like that they're both dead. This also should show you what people will do for money. Dude was counting his reward money while watching the news talk about the death of queen and slim. Would've been better if they would have got away and charges would have been dropped after replay of the video.,Queen & Slim
345,alexrbos,Largely Let Down,3,8 April 2020,"Really wanted this movie to be good when i saw the trailer. Not for a political reason, i just thought it seemed like an interesting Bonnie and Clyde like premise. Loved the actors and overall thought the acting was quite good. The writing, character arcs, and plot line fall apart really quickly though. It left me laughing sometimes at how outlandish it was and frustrated me at the same time. The cop pulls his gun on Slim because Slim says it's cold outside? ok? The girl follows a random guy on a nationwide manhunt she just met on tinder 20 minutes ago after he kills a cop? ok? The protest scene makes no sense, who are they protesting? The moment of police brutality and murder in self defense happened like 8 states away from the protest? The whole movie is just a series of people making really bad and unrealistic decisions. Why didn't they look for legal help after they found out there was clear footage of self defense? who knows! Why did she implicate herself for no reason for a person she just met? who knows! Why did a small kid shoot a random innocent cop in the face later in the movie for no reason? Like none of the movie makes any sense.. Is that kind sheriff in kentucky just gonna suffocate in the trunk of the white honda accord? Why is she so constantly rude to him most of the film for no reason, but then loves him randomly in the last act? The movie could have been good and shined a positive political light at the same time. But it tries so hard in the political message department, that it falls very short in the good movie department. Anyone who says this movie is over a 4, is saying so for a misguided reason. The film has got good actors saying bad lines, and doing dumb and insane things.",Queen & Slim

347,mrskimberlydiaz,What the hell...,1,22 October 2020,"This could've been a great moving. Impacting.
But they completely botched it.
The only reason it was rated so high is bc of the movement other than that the story was lost. Young black kid shoots a black cop? Then a black man turns them in for money but for the entire movie was supposed to be black lives matter. Black supporting their community.. and to top it off they just die in the end so stupid",Queen & Slim
348,gustavnwiklund,Brilliant!,10,27 February 2021,"Absolutely brilliant! The story line does not seem so new but what an execution. The script, the music, picture is all in all fantastic. Highly recommend this one!",Queen & Slim
349,wendybisimwa-63886,Wtf,8,29 August 2021,"Gave it an 8/10 because I hated the scene where Slim called his dad. That was such a stupid decision. Or the last part where he carried her and got shot 8 times??! Anyway, the film was beautiful and I loveeeed the cinematography!",Queen & Slim

353,tlenora3,Check your expectations,9,30 November 2019,I think most people expect an action packed movie. But it's a beautifully slow romance. I loved it.,Queen & Slim
354,leonwechter,"Good premise, poorly executed",4,19 October 2020,"Several parts of this just make no sense whatsoever, which is a shame as there are parts of it that are really good.My main issue was with the female ""protagonist"" who is one of the most intensely unpleasant characters I've ever watched! From the outset to the conclusion I hated ever action she took and every word out over her mouth! (The acting was good, just a terrible character) The film's inciting incident and her resulting attitude sums her up quite well...During a traffic stop a clearly cop tries to arrest our male protagonist (the titular ""Slim"") at gun point, at which point she gets out of the car and starts yelling at the officer demanding to know what he's arresting Slim for, demanding the cop's badge number, and generally making the situation worse until it comes to a head with her being injured and the cop getting killed. At this point our self proclaimed ""Excellent attorney"" convinces Slim that he has no choice but to go on the run as no one will believe this was self defense (for some reason completely forgetting that cop cars have dashcams). Slim reluctantly agrees to leave, a few miles down the road Slim questions her decision to leave and she responds with an attitude that screams ""how dare you question me"" while saying ""We came to that decision together!"" (Which they absolutely did not)Given how awful she was I couldn't buy into the romantic subplot that they've tried to weave into this which lead to me nitpicking the rest of the film and unfortunately it doesn't stand up to scrutiny.I will say that Daniel Kaluuya was on great form but couldn't carry the film on his own, I won't say don't bother but if you do want to watch this lower your expectations.",Queen & Slim

356,henryp2192,One of the best films of 2019,9,1 December 2019,"Queens and Slim is a truly original story. Lena's screen play is sharp, raw and perfectly depicts the sense of trauma that can be experienced as a person of color in America. Despite a slight lack of character development, this film is an incredible addition to modern black cinema.",Queen & Slim
357,koike_hess,The reviews say it all,10,22 August 2021,"This movie is so intense. I felt it from start to finish. I lived each and every moment. My girlfriend and I watched it together.As a person of color myself, I knew how each scene would play out. Cause I felt I've been in similar situations or could empathize so much with emotions of each of the characters. Both white and black, as I grew up in a mainly white town then moved to the city.There are almost ONLY good intentions. From the police, fearing for aggression. From the people that tried helping the fugitive couple but especially from the couple themselves.There's the law. There's knowing the law. And there's good and bad choices and consequences.This movie, combines it all. It's a unique piece. Thought provoking and so raw and real as can be seen from the reviews.Many people think it's too political. For me it's not. It's a story that many people of color can relate too. You feel for the characters and can't help but think 'What would I have done?'. And with each scene there's funny moments, moments of freedom, moments of relief and sadness.I lived this film so much it left a mark.This movie deserves credits hence after watching maybe a thousand movies I decided to write my first review.Watch the movie and accept that this could be happening. Don't judge the message. Live the story.",Queen & Slim
358,m-rashida,9/10,9,3 December 2019,"Kudos to Chi-towns own Lena Waithe. I love this movie. I'd pay to see it again. I experienced every possible emotion while watching these two beautiful Black characters on their journey to ""freedom"". There are laughs, tears and lessons along the way. If you like poetry, art, nature and Black people you will appreciate what this film has to offer us. But this is just my opinion. Go see for yourself. Peace.",Queen & Slim
359,jennaarmy,Surprisingly yet beautifully symbolic ending,10,1 April 2021,"I loved this movie! I cried at the very end. You can't help but root for them to live and hope they make it to Cuba.

360,ana_rodriguez82,Mehhh but then ending made up for it!,5,17 February 2020,"I had much higher expectations tbh; the narrative is a strong one & this film had the capacity to really stand out but the lines were bleak, the humour almost cringeworthy & Jodie Smith is entirely wooden almost throughout! The sex scene amped things up a bit but frankly came too late to save the day. The ending was a slow burner & there was a tiny glimpse of hope they might get away but then when Jodie got shot, I didn't get the concept of Slim/Daniel running towards the police with her dead body?! At least try jump on the jet or bring out your own firearm! Anyway enjoy!",Queen & Slim
361,ashley_davis24,Loved it!!,9,22 November 2019,"If you are black, and emotional this movie will take you through it! Its a great movie. EVERYONE should go see it!",Queen & Slim
362,madfrich,Emotionally Honest Movie,9,30 November 2019,"The only crime committed in the movie is police harassment and brutality. What happens in the aftermath is a matter of survival and support.The negative reviews seem to indicate the bias demonstrated in the movie. NO ONE has the right to BULLY anyone regardless of their title, position, rank, class, culture or race.This movie shows the essence of Black life in the USA regardless of socio-economic position. It really does not matter what money or position Blacks have, they're still treated negatively. And, the majority always want to justify the negative behavior.Great movie! Definitely worth going to see.",Queen & Slim
363,fjsupo,You need to sit with this movie.,10,1 December 2019,Just saw this movie. Still processing everything. It is a must see. It was genuine and heartfelt and different in a gorgeous way. I loved it and will likely see it again.,Queen & Slim
364,kathywilsonjones,Enjoyed,10,9 December 2019,"The movie starts off easy with Slim & Queen on a Tinder date. Queen's attitude gives glimpses of things to come as she seemingly difficult. Slim on the other hand, is laid back. A good balance for someone uptight. As they are heading home an incident happens were both lives are changed forever. In this incident, it shows that no matter what if confronted with racism demise is imminent. I felt like Queen escalated events that may or may not have happened to and with them. Watching their situation makes one question what they would do in a similar situation. I often felt like Queen's advise wasn't the best. As the journey through from place to place, it felt frustrating at times at choices they made. I felt a sense of urgency for them at times when they seemed to have forgotten their situation. There are other parts that seemed farfetched, for an example the scene where the police officer let them go. I can't see that happening realistically. The movie was long; glad I went early. Overall, I thought it was a good movie. But, I honestly could have waited for to appear on HBO, demand or Netflix. It gets burdensome having to constantly be bombarded with Black life this way. But, I guess that's the point; try living it.",Queen & Slim

368,RavenRochelle,Story and Editing,7,7 December 2019,"Overall the concept of the story was very strong and portrayed well with these two actors. Although there were some weird edits where they would stop talking then start talking and maybe that was meant to happen or it could've been one of the we can get away with doing this type of artistic avenue but, even the moment with the son of the mechanic became a bit forced without spoiling too much. The ending was awkward and made me livid rather than emotionally sad or compelled and connected to the characters.",Queen & Slim
369,wandering-dragon,"A real, beautiful film",9,4 December 2019,"This gets a lot of flack for being a social commentary, but for those of us who have ever lived a life where any of the events in the film are a reality or a real possibility, it's simply a look at life: exploring oneself, learning to love and trust, and trying to figure out a direction under pressure. There's more humor and affection in this film than one might fear, so go and enjoy it.",Queen & Slim
370,tom_rawle,A beautifully mastered modern tale of complex morality,9,17 February 2020,"From the first scene in the movie, I loved the way it was filmed.Two main characters, isolated on camera detailing their flaws. As the plot grows and the stakes become higher, the characters become one as the camera brings them together into shots. One of my favourite scenes is the use of silhouette from behind the car before they reach the gas station.Dark and gritty in the bad, but a clear and colourful tint when there's hope. While the music is thoughtful with song lyrics and titles as well as capturing the mood.The plot is a bit too Bonnie and Clyde, nevertheless seems a fitting two fingers up to Hollywood and its treatment of cultural representation.A powerful message of police brutality with characters representing both wrong and right adding to the moral dilemma of their actions.Have seen many slate the plot because of how ""unbelievable"" their decision to run was ""considering Queen's profession"". If anything her experience as a lawyer seeing young black men being imprisoned and even executed for less, probably drove their decision to run.Thought Kaluuya was brilliant, big fan of the young actor. Yet even more impressed with Turner-Smith who played a complex part very aptly.",Queen & Slim
371,willbprod,Just a great film.,9,2 December 2019,This film starts off fast and have you thinking it's going to be one way but its totally another way. A love story for us by us. True heroes have it the hardest.,Queen & Slim
372,bfpalmer,Unapologetic. Beautiful. Complex. Painful. Human.,10,30 November 2019,"This movie is deeply layered and stunningly filmed. It pushes you to think about the reality of oppression and the finite nature of our existence. It flips the ""on-the-run"" movie on its head and centers Black humanity. This is mandatory reading.",Queen & Slim
373,umorton,THIS IS A MUST SEE,10,3 December 2019,The poetic writing down to the directing & phenomenal acting top notch. This story is meant to be understood by those who gets it. If anyone gave this a 1 star it's because they clearly don't know greatness when they see it.,Queen & Slim
374,allienasha,Good one for the Culture,9,30 November 2019,"Many people will be mad at the ending of this film, but I thought the ending was realistic and played out well if that scenario really happened what the outcome would have been for a black couple in that situation.

375,BPatrick0745,A solid film,8,22 November 2019,"The movie is an emotional journey. The character are humanized. For a person of color, you can easily envision yourself in their shoes. The film does have an artistic quality to it which further enhances the movie. The story is good. I wish the film spent a little more time on some of the secondary characters. However, I also understand it was not their story. The film is long. A few scenes could have been cut. Nevertheless, it is a good film and worth seeing. Ignore all the negative views who are trying to bomb the reviews just because the movie stars black actors.",Queen & Slim

The actors are phenomenal in there roles, they leave viewers feeling apart of them in a way. This has got to be one of the best films of 2019. But it will unlikely get the credit it deserves due to Hollywood. The film may be too black for Hollywood to recognize this as an amazing film. I will give it a solid 9 out of 10 easily.",Queen & Slim
380,chickenfolife,HATERS will tell you it's not great because of the message,9,30 November 2019,"This movie was full of emotion. Both actors were strong, and the storyline flowed. I think people who give it trash ratings most likely don't like the issue presented in the movie, which is police brutality among African Americans. I think they are giving it low ratings because it makes them feel uncomfortable. Half of them probably never even saw it!!",Queen & Slim

382,daniiellerz,A necessary watch,9,28 November 2019,"Such an entertaining adventure that had me on the edge of my seat the entire 2 hours, and beautifully shot. Regardless of the critics, it's an important story that needed to be told. Yes, there are moments that are dragged out, but that's part of the journey. The more you think about it after you see it, the more small metaphors for our current world you'll see sprinkles without. You can tell every shot and every piece of dialogue is intentional. Queen & Slim has the potential to become a real game changer when it comes to the tragic reality of police brutality.",Queen & Slim

384,HJ_movies,A gripping social commentary,8,22 December 2019,"I was surprised to see that this movie only got 7 on IMDB. This is a gripping and well paced social commentary that made me feel quite emotional and led me to have a lengthy discussion with my friend about the issues portrayed in the movie. Certain plots, like what Junior did, seem to be a bit over dramatic to me. But overall I think it is a very solid movie.",Queen & Slim
385,rmaynard-03544,Disappointed,2,10 December 2019,I was disappointed with the way the story was told - I enjoyed the character Slim but that's about it - in my opinion most of the time there was a whole lot of nothing going on - seemed to be either predicable or unbelievable - some refer to the romance in the movie maybe that's why I didn't care for it as I'm not really a fan of romantic movies,Queen & Slim

Scenes jump back and forth from a riot where the mechanics son has joined the riot and where Queen and Slim are VERY passionately making love.

There are some scenes...it you know what I mean.",Queen & Slim
388,saske-03764,Good road movie,8,21 April 2020,"Last year, a lot of everything came out that I still have to rake. One of this watch list turned out to be the film Queen and Slim directed by Melina Matsukas. Road movie in the American setting. Well, some place here is occupied by criticism of racism. The plot remotely resembles the Green Book (2018), which I sincerely hate.In fact, everything turned out to be three times more interesting. A black couple, having met in a tinder by returning from the first date, accidentally kills a policeman and goes on the run across half the country, whom he has not met on the way. Somewhere in the background looms the topic of aggressive behavior by American police towards African Americans, but this is felt as a detail of the setting and, as a whole, does not receive proper development.The more important part - the first boring trip to indie of the director's first full-length film - before that, Melina Matsukas was shooting only music videos. And this is noticeable - the picture is replete with unusual cameraman solutions, geometry in the frame and a ton of various stereotypical ""black"" music - from blues to modern cloud rap.",Queen & Slim
389,gusgusferguson,The beautiful and the damned,9,26 October 2020,One viewer's uneven is another's surprising. A very moving film about the strangers on the run falling in love. it's just a swerve that sets the tragic events in motion. Daniel Kaluuya And Jodie Turner-Smith have real chemistry. Both very detailed performances. Both characters reveal themselves as lost but somehow finding themselves in the each other. Daniel Kaluuya Manages to fit in some quirky elements of his character that you wouldn't normally see in a larger budget film. Jodi Turner Smith's character is a defense attorney but little is done with this information after 10 minutes. JTS is very solid in her debut role  gives a luminous performance of real vulnerability and depth. It's not a film that requires such close examination though as the emotional Performances are so well done. There is also a really thoughtful handling of the consequences of violence as they Ripple out from the first shot fired. . The strength of the film is that you really care about all of the characters. That's why I find myself writing on IMDb.,Queen & Slim
390,turndatablez,"I thought this would be the ""One"" not the 1 Star!",1,28 November 2019,"This is my first ever review. I looked forward to watching this film because I thought it had the potential to be an empowering agent of change in the narrative of Black people and our relationship with law enforcement. It failed terribly.I was disappointed that in the end the viewer is left with the image of two bloodied black bodies (both unarmed) shot dead by a barrage of white police. Without going into much detail that would give away the movie I will give what I believe could have been a more powerful plot line.Queen is a defense attorney. Instead of going on an unrealistic ""run"" from the police I thought that maybe this production team would have given this character an opportunity to use her intellectual capacity as a defense attorney in a court of law to fight and WIN the murder charge. Queen and Slim being ALIVE and FREE at the end of this movie as opposed to DEAD and GONE would finally be a cinematic victory for Black people not only in America but throughout the diaspora.But, Hollywood is always going to be Hollywood and in order to green light productions that try to deal with race relations (particularly between Black people and law enforcement) there is going to always be the compromise. This movie is a great example of the Compromise.Thank you for reading my first ever review!",Queen & Slim
