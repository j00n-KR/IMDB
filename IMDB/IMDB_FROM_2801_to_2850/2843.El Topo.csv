0,MartinHafer,I am amazed at all the positive reviews this film has received.,1,27 October 2009,"Well, that's two hours of my life I'll never get back. Because I have seen and reviewed so many films, I felt like sooner or later I had to get to EL TOPO. It's one of those legendary films that cinephiles have talked about for years, so I reluctantly rented it. Sadly, I could have watched a Pauly Shore or Jonas Brothers movie instead--that's how much I hated EL TOPO.Where do I begin? With most movies I dislike, I try to look at what, specifically, I didn't like as well as try to find some positives. However, with EL TOPO, I hated everything about the film and the only positives are that it wasn't one minute longer and the film's creator has been unable to do a sequel due to difficulty with financing (ain't that a big surprise). Although the midnight movie crowd has adored this film, it is simply nihilistic and nasty. It's full of blasphemous imagery, nudity, buckets of blood, killing of the handicapped for kicks, countless animals brutally slaughtered for the film and the unrelentingly depressing and nonsensical nature of the film--and these elements (plus many more) put together make this a terrible and rather evil film. I am sure that Jodorowsky wanted to offend and provoke the audience, but with so much provocation coming non-stop, it all just got very, very boring after a short time. Imagine if now, in the more permissive 21st century, if the followup film were made. What could Jodorowsky do to top EL TOPO---personally come to the theater and kill patrons or have sex with animals?! I mean, how can you top EL TOPO for depravity?! I think had this film been made in a different time, it would have totally bombed. But, in 1970, the New Age guru-inspired plot elements, the widespread use of hallucinogens and a desire for something different converged to make this film work for a small fringe element. Otherwise, I can't see any normal person bothering with such a self-indulgent ""film"".Avoid this like the plague unless you think seeing rotting, eviscerated animals is art! I mean, think about it--donkeys and horses were killed and gutted (with the entrails hanging out) and dozens of bunnies and assorted other creatures were also killed for our entertainment! And, while you are at it, there were simulated rapes, killing of the handicapped and the sodomizing priests!!! Isn't there sometimes SOMETHING that the film community might consider wrong?! Nah,...I guess not.",El Topo
1,Leofwine_draca,Style over substance,5,2 September 2013,"Yeah, I didn't think much of this surrealist western, even though I was prepared to like it and WANTED to like it was I watched. By the end I couldn't help but feel it's another case of ""the emperor's new clothes"" in terms of style over substance, and the sum of the whole ending up much less than the individual parts.The story starts out straightforward enough, with a distinctive gunslinger discovering the aftermath of a massacre and vowing to take revenge on the outlaws responsible. Once that story is out of the way, though, it starts getting weirder and weirder, almost existentialist, as the gunslinger has encounters with a series of deity-like characters in the desert and undergoes a religiously significant transformation. By the end, I was quite frankly bored.Here's the good stuff: Jodorowsky's cinematography, which is glorious. EL TOPO is vibrant-looking and colourful throughout, and I love the use of surreal imagery which really works. There are poignant scenes and flashes of Peckinpah-style ultra-violence and the contrasting elements are mixed together well. It's just the script, really, which lets it down, becoming too abstract; I always prefer a more concrete narrative as a basis on which to pin the more fantastic elements, but EL TOPO is lacking such a construct and at times just seems to be being made up as it goes along.",El Topo
2,kosmasp,It's all about the animals,6,23 April 2021,"I know that explaining why you rate something may be overrated, but I'm giving it a shot for those interested and not just liking or disliking that I gave this a 6. As I already hinted at in the summary line, it is about the animals in here in general and the bunnies in particular! The fact that actual animals died in the making of this. Now that is one thing ... but the fact that they died because of the heat they were exposed to ... Jodorowsky himself says he wouldn't be doing this nowadays and thought back then that the sacrifice was something natural/necessary. Now as a big friend of animals but even more so of bunnies I am almost baffled by myself not giving this an even lower vote, but I did try to take into account that he saw the error of his way and the rest of the movie.And now we can dive into that: a movie that seems to be divided into smaller parts. Which also is sort of true, because apparently Jodorowsky would not have gotten away with the things he depicts here, if he had claimed and told authorities back then what he was up to. Short movies on the other hand could be made at any point. Jodorowsky also plays the main role, which you may or may not appreciate. I'd say about 3/4 of the movie work very well ... and then you get an end part that seems completely detached from the rest.Then again this is Jodorowsky, so while the shooting short movies may be one ""excuse"", the other explanation would just be he did his own thing and tried things out ... anything spiritual that came to mind - his mind that is. Although as a viewer you are encouraged to think a lot ... you have to connect the dots ... and/or listen to his interviews/audio commentaries to find out what he actually meant to tell us there. Some symbolism is quite easy to decrypt ... other things not so much. Even some of his fans have a different view on what it means than the main man himself - which in now way is or has to be something bad.The movie is quite infamous for being his most bloody one yet - and it is true, if you are easily offended ... it is probably better if you do not watch this at all. Then there is also nudity and a lot of weird characters doing weird things ... symbolically speaking and all that. Let's just say you have to be in the right frame of mind. And seeing a kid being naked ... now the kid himself (interviewed for the disc/company I bought) was not scarred or at least seem to have grown up more than ok. That doesn't mean that some people won't have issues with that though ... kind of like me being really mad about the bunnies ...",El Topo
3,gavin6942,Bizarre Masterpiece,8,25 August 2015,"A mysterious black-clad gunfighter (Alejandro Jodorowsky) wanders a mystical Western landscape encountering multiple bizarre characters.Phil Hardy wrote, ""Rather in the manner of Federico Fellini, whose self-conscious conflation of the roles of charlatan and ringmaster of the unconscious Jodorowsky apes, the film is a breathtaking concoction of often striking, but more often ludicrous, images. The result is a movie that, though it impressed many at the time of its original release, in retrospect is clearly a minor, albeit often very funny work."" Hardy is among good company. The critics largely thought it was an empty film, and it was rejected by the Academy to even be considered as a nominee for Foreign Film.Roger Ebert is more positive, including it as one of his Great Movies. And he is right. Alongside ""Holy Mountain"", Jodorowsky creates a world that must be seen to be believed. Maybe it can not all be understood and maybe it is not meant to be understood, but he was making beautiful and strange films years before the modern masters (e.g. Lynch) even got started.",El Topo
4,lee_eisenberg,underground Mexico,10,29 December 2012,"""El Topo"" is one movie that will probably not leave people neutral. Alejandro Jodorowsky's underground masterpiece about a gunfighter on a quest for enlightenment almost seems like a joke given the over-the-top violence, but is one of the most impressive pieces of work. I figure that the movie very likely irritated the religious authorities due to one scene in particular. But the movie is truly something that you have to see to believe. It's sort of half-western, half-mysticism, with the main character's journey mirroring the efforts of a mole to find the light. It's easily the sort of movie that Quentin Tarantino could've directed. Overall, one might call ""El Topo"" the supreme rejection of the John Wayne type of westerns. If in fact Jodorowsky ever gets around to making a sequel, I'll be eager to see how he continues the story. Really good movie.",El Topo
5,jboothmillard,El Topo (The Mole),5,8 September 2011,"This Spanish language film I spotted because it was featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I wasn't sure what I would make of it before I watched, but I am glad I did. Basically El Topo (Alejandro Jodorowsky, also writing and directing) is the cowboy riding his horse with his naked six year old son riding with him, and they are burying childhood photos and objects in the desert sand to make the boy a man. Journeying back they come across a massacre of blood and bodies, all killed by bandits, and deciding he is something of a God he decides he should get revenge for these people, including killing the fat bald Colonel. After leaving his son in the care of some monks, El Topo rides off with Mara (Mara Lorenzio) whom the Colonel kept as a slave, and she encourages him to kill four guns-men to be the greatest in the land, but he ends up feeling guilty afterwards. After being shot by another woman and Mara abandoning him he is dragged away by some dwarfs and mutants, and years later he is in a cave full of deformed outcasts who have made him their God. They only have one way out of the cave, and El Topo decides to help them escape, and he also forms a lover relationship with a dwarf girl, and then he wants money for dynamite. El Topo's grown up son finds him and threatens to kill him for abandoning him, but after he allows the outcasts to get out, and he succeeds in creating an exit that all the people flood out of. In the end he does gets some mortal wounds from the cultists, but he ignores these and sees his girlfriend give birth, only to die and go into a grave covered in a beehive, and El Topo's son, the girlfriend and the baby ride away. I will be honest, the story is rather complicated and anyone including may get confused and not understand, most of it is a collection of bizarre images, ideas and situations. This is called the cult film fan's cult film, I can certainly see that it won't be to everyone's taste, but it is certainly in many ways near essential viewings, if you are one for films with a lot of blood and weirdness, then this is for you, a good surreal spaghetti western. Worth watching!",El Topo
6,Quinoa1984,"hey, why not?",8,26 June 2006,"I think that was what I said to myself while I watched a bootleg of this underground cult-classic by the un-prolific but undeniably original surrealist Alejandro Jodorowsky. Because, frankly, even with all of the supposed symbolism injected into the film (some that sticks, some that really doesn't), shouldn't really detract from what makes the film work- or not for some. Basically, if you're going into this movie expecting another quasi-genre bending genre western via Sergio Leone, look elsewhere. El Topo is like one uncompromising fever dream that Leone might have had if he had taken a nice bite of peyote. Jodorowsky as writer, director, producer, has this attitude of 'why not' in his unique form of gonzo cinema, where it's more about taking in individual scenes, images, sights, like a manic freak-show with lots of harsh violence (for its time at least). And it did work for me, at least as long as I didn't take it TOO seriously.To describe the 'story' of the film might be close to moot, but I'll just give a two-sentence sum-up. Jodorowsky plays El Topo, a lone, odd gunman who stops a group of wildly deranged bandits (a sign of things to come, making Leone's bandits look like playground kids), lets his naked son off with a group of monks, and sets off to defeat the four best gunmen in the world. After waking up years later after being shot by his former female co-patriots, he tries to help a group of invalid incestuous types make their way to the zealous, un-hinged town above, where his son is full-grown and the sanest in town. OK, if that may give an idea as to what the film is about, keep in mind that this was made in 1969/1970, at a time when a director like Jodorowsky was not only accepted but needed by movie fans who were looking for films that shook the culture. In that sense El Topo is close to being as important as Easy Rider. But to say it's as exceptional is really about as subjective as you can get.Going into the film, all I really had to go on what to expect came from a documentary on midnight movies (where El Topo found its first audience as the first of its kind), and the clips shown and Jodorowsky's own words on it had me excited to see it- though not with the highest of expectations. Watching the film, and after reading several reviews, it's hard still for me to take the film 100% seriously, at least of it being a highly symbolic, poetic work of an art film. If anything, my perception of the film is that it is so ridiculous at times, so strange, and even so deliberate, that a director like Jodorowsky had to recognize the ridiculousness at times. That he also has a definite affinity for the outcasts and 'freaks' of life adds to the enjoyment, that he makes no bones about identifying with these those who are unusual (which make up the bulk of the picture). But it's success for its cult audience has to be due as much to its wild, hilarious appeal as for its art-film, if not more so. In a way, it's too much fun to be a dull, pretentious work- the filmmaker seems to be too talented to really force feed all of this to some amorphous blob of an audience.So, is it a little dated, sure; does it have an entire midsection where certain scenes involving El Topo and his female tag-alongs that jump ahead and misses any conventional logic, of course; does it skate along the edge of being almost a very bad movie, absolutely. But as a fan of westerns, and surrealism, the two do merge well enough for the film El Topo, especially for the fact that it accomplishes what each do- it gives action and daring-do like the westerns, and it provides a level of humor and no-holds-barred outrageousness that marks the tops of surrealist works. If the look on your face at the end is that of a slight jaw-drop and raised eye-brow, however, it's a feeling that's shared by others I'm sure, at least by me.",El Topo
7,Coventry,The Weird Weird West,8,5 November 2006,"So far I had only seen Jodorowsky's ""Santa Sangre"", but that one happens to be my all-time favorite film! One thing's for sure with this director whenever you check out one of his films for the first time: you should expect the unexpected and prepare yourself for not believing what your own eyes are observing most of the time. Just in case you really have to label ""El Topo"" with a genre, it would presumably be Western, but that still doesn't give you any idea of the film's content whatsoever. Within the first ten minutes alone, things occur that are already too weird to mention (like grown men shooting at women's shoes and bandits dancing and caressing monks!!) and these sequences aren't relevant to the actual plot yet! Well, I'd love to summarize the main story lines, but the truth is that I didn't understand one iota of it all. The pivot character El Topo, portrayed by the director himself, rides through the desert with a 7-year-old naked kid in tow. He exchanges the kid for a beautiful woman after defeating a gang of thugs and goes on a quest to visit four ""masters"" of the desert. Subsequently, he joins a community of mountain people and fervently helps them coming out of their dark habitat and into the open world. Yes, it's a very vague description, but that's because I didn't know what was going on anyway. Most likely, you won't either and that's not an insult to your personal intellect! It's just a messed up movie that you mainly just need to watch for its visual brilliance, symbolism and extremely stylish choreography. Every single character that walks through the screen is a demented & complex individual, and the protagonist is the absolute biggest weirdo of them all. He actually claims to be God himself  and really believes it, too  and does the most unpredictable things imaginable. Admittedly, this film isn't suitable for entertainment purposes. It's an intense and demanding experience that you should approach with an open state of mind and loads of patience. Purely elite cinema that can't be compared to anything else ever made.",El Topo
8,lastliberal,Not your daddy's western,7,20 April 2008,"I watched a couple of westerns this week and neither are what you would call typical. This one certainly isn't like anything I saw on Saturday mornings growing up.Alejandro Jodorowsky is definitely a surrealist, and incorporates many different religious themes in this film. Basically, it is about a man searching for spirituality. He encounters all these different religious ideas. Now, that is just my interpretation, as the basic idea of Jodorowsky, who wrote directed and starred in the film, is that everyone gets their own meaning from it. (He also designed the costumes and sets and composed music for the film.)He will not reveal his thinking on the film.Don't look for any ""stars"" as most of the people in the film only appeared in this one film. It was shot in Mexico and the cinematography by Rafael Corkidi is brilliant.It is not a film in the traditional sense, but something to be experienced.",El Topo
9,Boba_Fett1138,Some movies can't be described in words.,8,7 December 2007,"Some movies are just impossible to describe and are something you really need to experience for yourself. ""El Topo"" is perhaps one of the weirdest, most surrealistic but also most beautiful movie experiences you'll ever experience.The movie began extremely well and amusing and I liked were the movie was heading to. It was amusing and unusual. I must admit the movie sort of went downhill for me after that, when the movies just got weirder and weirder and less and less things made sense any more. But nevertheless the whole experience and journey of the movie makes this a more than worthwhile one. A real cult western!It's violent, it's graphic, it has nudity but all set in a surrealistic world, with surrealistic characters and events, so you just know that it's all going to be something special and unusual, rather than just something that tries to shock and also without ever getting over pretentious.It's a beautifully shot and directed movie. Director Alejandro Jodorowsky did not only directed this, he also played the lead role, wrote, composed, was the production designer and costume designer of the movie. So this movie is completely his work and vision. It's not hard to see why he has such a big and impressive following.It's hard to describe or say what the movie is about or what Alejandro Jodorowsky tries to achieve with it. It's more a viewing experience that everyone undergoes differently and different conclusion and meanings from it can be drawn by everyone individually. I think this was also Jodorowsky's point.A true one of a kind movie experience you have to see and undergo for yourself.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",El Topo
10,zetes,"I wouldn't call this a great movie, but it's definitely a must-see. It's finally on DVD in Region 1!",8,14 May 2007,"Saw this several years ago on a VHS bootlegged from the Japanese, blurred-pubes laser disc. It's probably because of the lousy format that I hardly remember a thing about it. Finally, after years of waiting, it gets released in Region 1 in a super-deluxe box set from Anchor Bay, which also includes The Holy Mountain, Fando y Lis, an early short (La Cravate), full-length commentaries, a feature documentary about director Alejandro Jodorowsky, and the soundtracks to both El Topo and The Holy Mountain. Talk about an awesome package! And for only $30 on Deep Discount DVD. This may just be the DVD of the year. As for the film itself, while I may not remember it very well, I remember my reaction to it, and my opinion is mostly unchanged. It's a product of its acid-laced time, and the film itself is mostly just silly and pretty much the definition of weird for the sake of weird. That's not to say I dislike it, however. Oh no, I can appreciate weird for the sake of weird, and this is a very entertaining movie in that respect. It also has some of the most amazing and imaginative images ever committed to film. My favorite sequence is probably the rabbit corral.",El Topo
11,HumanoidOfFlesh,"Bizarre,surreal and amazingly violent.",8,2 April 2002,"This is my first venture into Jodorowsky's territory and I can safely say that I'm highly impressed.""El Topo"" is one of the most bizarre and impressive movies you'll ever see.It features plenty of interesting,weird characters,lots of religious symbolism and extremely violent gun-fight scenes.One of the producers of this one is Mexican horror veteran Juan Lopez Moctezuma(""Alucarda"",""Mary,Mary,Bloody Mary"").I urge you to see this masterpiece right now.Simply breathtaking!",El Topo
12,MOscarbradley,Masterpiece or X-rated MontyPython sketch? You decide...,6,6 August 2008,"It has been said that Jodorowsky's ""El Topo"" is like a Spaghetti Western directed by Luis Bunuel and who am I to argue, but you may find the excessive blood-letting, copious displays of nudity, (including a seven year-old boy), emphasis on all kinds of physical deformity and some girl-on-girl action more in keeping with an exploitation picture albeit one dressed up in some very fancy new clothes, (at least of the emperor's variety). There is also so much religious imagery and symbolism that it almost verges on the blasphemous.It's also a movie very much of it's time, (1970). There is no real narrative structure and its surrealism tends towards the psychedelic. It's a product of the drug-culture and its cult reputation stems mainly from those who were high when they first saw it. But there are certainly few films like it, (and any that are were probably directed by Jodorowsky). There are even those who hail it as a masterpiece. The magazine 'Films and Filming' voted it the best film of its year while others may feel it is closer to a Monty Python sketch or an X-rated version of ""Blazing Saddles"". In the end, it's a film that needs to be experienced; whether or not you 'like' it or even admire it is something else again.",El Topo
13,Bored_Dragon,"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do",7,5 August 2021,"The film that made Jodorowsky famous deserves a serious review. I am not capable of writing it, because this is my first encounter with Jodorowsky, and this completely crazy western left me speechless for quite a while.Jodorowsky is a poet, writer, screenwriter, actor, director, musician, painter, comic book artist, sculptor, and even a clown, still active at the age of 92. You can imagine what we can expect from a person like this. In fact, you can't. I don't think anyone expected a movie like ""El Topo"".The story is set somewhere on Weird West and follows a lone gunslinger, who is a combination of Leone's Man with No Name and Jesus from ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", played by Jodorowsky himself.In the first part of the film, he returns to the village with his seven-year-old son (played by Jodorowsky's son) and finds a massacre. He sets out in pursuit of the perpetrators and finds them in a Franciscan monastery, terrorizing monks. He kills them all and keeps for himself the wife of their leader, leaving his son to the monks.At the urging of a new woman, he sets out in search of the four best desert revolvers, in order to defeat them, prove that he is the best, and win the woman's favor. He cheats and succeeds, but his woman betrays him and leaves with another, leaving him wounded in the desert.In my opinion, here is one of the best scenes in the film. The woman's lover shoots him four times, one bullet in both palms and both feet, which symbolizes Jesus' wounds from the nails, and then his woman betrays him, finishing him with a bullet in the side.In the second part of the film, he is found by a group of deformed dwarves, who live in a deep cave below the mountain. When they nurtured him to full strength, he decides to repay them by digging a tunnel that will connect them with the nearby town. His now-grown son returns to the story. He wants to kill the father, but allows him to complete the tunnel first. But, it turns out that the city is a decadent and in every way perverted place, which will not welcome newcomers with open arms.The timeline of the story is totally vague and abstract, and the story itself, taken literally, does not make much sense, but is more symbolic. I have no problem with the symbols in the film, when they fit well into the story, but there are only symbols here, and the whole film is one big allegory about sin and redemption.Apart from El Topo, the characters are not particularly developed and their stories do not intertwine, but our anti-hero meets them one by one or in small groups and their screen-time is rather short. However, that doesn't make them any less impressive, because they are all quite original and extremely bizarre.Visually, ""El Topo"" is excellently shot and has a mesmerizing surreal atmosphere, but the scenes captured in these art photographs are not for everyone's stomach. ""El Topo"" is extremely explicit in depicting nudity, perversions, mental and physical abuse, killing and massacre, which definitely do not lack imagination in the ways they try to turn your stomach upside down. And yet, all those situations and the general atmosphere are so surreal that it makes them silly, at times even funny, in a Monty Python way.General impression - ""El Topo"" kept my undivided attention, I laughed a little, at times it was a little tense, and mostly my jaw dragged on the floor in disbelief. There is a message and a moral, those who are more sensitive may find some human warmth, it is well shot, but you will not find a coherent story here. A warm recommendation to fans of acid western and bizarre art film in general, but the mainstream audience should better skip it.7/10.",El Topo
14,kenjha,Holy Crap,1,22 April 2008,"To say that Jodorowsky uses symbolism in this film is an understatement. There is no plot; it's all symbolism, a Biblical allegory exploring themes that only Jodorowsky and his fans can appreciate. The script, if it could be called that, is amateurish and pointless, featuring random acts of violence, which veers from silly to repellent. The self-indulgent Jodorowsky may be called a poor man's Sergio Leone, but doing so would be an insult to the Italian master. The acting is uniformly terrible, including Jodorowsky himself in the title role, a la The Man With No Name. Films like this give surrealism a bad name.",El Topo
15,poe426,Existential epic...?,5,21 September 2007,"Comic book writer Alejandro Jodorowsky's EL TOPO (""The Mole,"" not to be confused with Johnston McCulley's EL ZORRO- ""The Fox"") plays out very much like what it essentially is: a cinematic comic book. Topo's ""spiritual journey"" calls to mind many of the martial arts movies of the early 1970's (wherein the hero is usually wronged- and severely beaten and/or his master killed- before he apprentices at the feet of another great master and returns, at film's end, to vanquish his mortal enemy). Jodorowsky himself is good as EL TOPO, but, like many a low budget filmmaker before (and after) him, he often resorts to tasteless exploitation when superior storytelling would've sufficed. It would be interesting to see what an older and wiser Jodorowsky would come up with vis a vis a remake.",El Topo
16,marmar-69780,El Topo,7,3 September 2020,"El Topo is a third film that i saw that was made by Jodorowsky after Holy Mountain and Santa Sangre and i must admit that i led that two films more then this one.But this is still another very weird and obscure film that perhaps only Alejandro could made,it has some tripy scenes but not in such a big way like in Santa Sangre and Holy Mountain but i still liked them for a most of part..Storytelling isnt the most important aspect here,it is rather a great trip that has a unique vision and style in it ,it also has some deep staff in it that will play with your mind,El Topo was a good film to experiance and if you love this style you should watch it",El Topo
17,arfdawg-1,Sorry but...,2,27 September 2019,...this movie is severely overrated. The over dubbing of the sound is freaking annoying. The movie has no real plot. And it's only a film you could remotely get into high.,El Topo
18,Captain_Couth,A peyote fueled western set in a nightmarish wasteland.,10,25 November 2003,"El Topo (1970) has to be one of the most strangest films in history. A mysterious gunfighter dressed in black accompanied by his young son cross the desert on a holy mission of vengence and redemption. It's a pretty twisted film that's highly enjoyable. Sadly, it's unavailable on video in the United States (legitimately) and it looks like it'll never get a proper release in this country. A film filled with all kinds of beautiful people and unique individuals and it comes across like a bad LSD trip. Too many crazy visuals for a sane person to handle. Many of the film's scenes will be burned into you brain long after you seen it. I highly recommend this movie, It's one you'll never forgot. A true experince in film-making.A+",El Topo
19,billcr12,Bad acting and script,2,4 May 2012,"El Topo looks like an early cut of a David Lynch project. The title character is also the director, Alejandro Jodorowsky, who at the beginning, looks like Zorro, dressed in black, riding a horse with his naked young son on board trekking through the desert of Mexico. They come across a group of dead bodies and the Latino Dirty Harry finds the perpetrators and kills them all, including their leader, the colonel, whose slave he rescues and names Mara. He leaves his kid at a mission and begins a quest to defeat four great gunmen. He conquers all of them, but feels guilty and throws away his weapons to seek a more peaceful life. Mara leaves him after he is shot down and then carried off by dwarfs and other odd people. El Topo wakes up in a cave with the strange assortment of freaks worshiping him as a deity. He meets a midget woman and they become lovers. She becomes pregnant and he puts together a plan to escape from the cave. By the time the movie ends, I was not impressed with the bad acting or horrendous script; avoid El Topo at all costs.",El Topo
20,Polaris_DiB,Famed underground movie finally released,7,14 May 2007,"El Topo is a famous cult movie well known historically as the movie that launched the Midnight Movie craze and aesthetically as a post-modern ""Western"" that takes on issues of mysticism, religion, and social-satire through compelling images of freaks, alternative sexuality, iconoclasm, no-holds-barred gore, and grotesquely obese women. It's not as good as it's fame will lead you to believe, but it's undeniably unforgettable.Many synopses sum this movie up as being about a gun-slinger mystic who takes on five of the world's best gun-fighters in the desert. That's, like, a third of the movie, and grossly underplays the importance of the rest of the film. However, it should be noted that that's also the most compelling and interesting of the movie, and that Jodorowsky's loose structure sometimes loses track of where it's going. To be sure, I was done with this movie a good half an hour before it was done with itself, though that's not to say there weren't more memorable moments to come. However, as a product definitely of the era and a post-modern look at mysticism and peace, it does deserve it's place as a challenging aesthetic that movie buffs and historians should see.If you liked this movie, my recommendation is to see Performance, a film contemporary to this one (though vastly different in nature) that was also as maltreated by distributors and that also recently got it's victorious DVD release. Between these two, you pretty much have mood of the late 60s/early 70s down.--PolarisDiB",El Topo
21,JasparLamarCrabb,"Surreal, brilliant, exhausting",6,7 January 2013,"There's a fine line between surrealistic entertainment & absolute repulsion in Alejandro Jodorowsky's classic. It's a line that is very blurry. Jodorowsky wrote, directed and stars as a gunslinger who takes on the four best sharpshooters around. He succeeds...or does he? The film is not a western in any traditional sense, but is instead an outrageous head trip full of A LOT of blood, a lot of bible inspired mysticism and a fair amount of gratuitous nudity. Jodorowsky, looking very Christ-like, has barely any dialog (and neither does anyone else), but somehow this nightmare of a film moves along quickly. The production values are outstanding.

22,arthur_tafero,"Absurdist, Violent Erotica and Satire - El Topo",6,9 November 2021,"While not as one-dimensional as Salo, which merely concentrates on sexual excessiveness, El Topo attacks many of society's unfortunate aberrations.. While it does go beyond accepted social norms, particularly with the use of impressionable children in several controversial scenes that will, most likely, affect them adversely, and the obvious use of harming helpless animals as a cheap device for shock value, the film still has some social value. The Jodorowsky brothers are sort of the Coen Brothers on crack. They are very creative, sometimes funny, and seldom boring. However, too much shock value begins to actually diminish the effect of the shock intended for the audience. Seeing one or two people get treated brutally is shock value; seeing dozens or hundreds of people getting treated brutally (such as the descendents from the 1930s film Freaks) greatly reduces that shock value. Despite these flaws, the film is interesting to view, and, to say the least, is very different from most other cinema.",El Topo
23,Nazi_Fighter_David,Not for the weak of heart,7,17 August 2008,"""El Topo"" was one of the first midnight-movie cult hits because of its visually stunning, mentally exciting indulgence in gratuitous sex and exaggerated violence Avenging angel El Topomeant to be wise and mysticalrides into a town whose population has just been massacred He guns down some of the cruel and perverse bandits responsible and brutally punishes their leader He leaves his seven-year-old son with some monks and goes away with the gang leader's woman, Mara In the desert sands, El Topo and Mara make love, and she quickly falls in love with him After their frantic love-making, she tells him that he can prove that he's the 'best' by killing the Four Masters For no apparent reason other than to please Mara, El Topo begins his mission, defeating and killing each of the Four Masters The film has been quite controversial It lacks clarity and has painful emotions that make it quite compelling",El Topo
24,EVOL666,"Strange, Trippy , And Violent Mexican Western...",8,25 June 2006,"As pretty much everyone else has already said - EL TOPO is a strange film filled with symbolism and ""meaning"" - some of which I grasped, some of which was lost in the confusing narrative and editing. A great film to ""look at""...uniquely ""stylish"" and interesting, especially for a Western..El Topo (The Mole) roams the land with his nekkid 7 year-old son in tow, shooting most everyone that crosses his path. He starts of by dispatching a gang of thieves, moves on to killing a ruthless and sleazy General (where afterwards he drops his son off to be raised by some monks), and then into the desert to find and kill four master gunmen. After that, the whole film gets real confusing to me, as it moves in a totally different direction revolving around a community of inbred cripples who are trapped living in a cave, and some guy (also El Topo?) who vows to free them from their ""prison""...Honestly, I didn't really know what the hell was going on with this film 90% of the time, but it really didn't matter. There's always something happening to keep your interest. A decent amount of nudity and a high quotient of bloody violence definitely help. The character of El Topo himself is pretty interesting as a sort of ""anti-hero"" who will resort to any means necessary to win his gunfights. I will say that the second portion of the film, though equally strange - felt disjointed and was not as enjoyable to me. Regardless, I recommend this film to those that enjoy strange/surreal films, Westerns, or just want something ""different"" for a change...8/10",El Topo
25,Witchfinder-General-666,Ingeniously Bizarre - A Unique Cinematic Experience,10,7 October 2008,"It is indisputable that Alejandro Jodorowsky's name stands for unique cinema. This man's incomparably bizarre and yet incomparably compelling films are absolute highlights in artistic underground cinema, and no true lover of film could possibly consider not seeing them. Out of Jodorowsky's films, it is ""El Topo"" of 1970 which is most treasured by cult-cinema lovers, and for good reasons. This must be one of the most bizarre and unique masterpieces ever made, and there is simply no other film like it. While ""El Topo"" looks like a (highly unusual) Western at first, it can not be attributed simply to this genre, as the film goes way beyond the borders of traditional film genres. ""El Topo"" may not be everybody's taste, but for those interested in bizarre and unique cult-cinema, this is one of the ultimate cinematic experiences. Jodorowsky's surreal world is simply astonishing in all aspects, be it the bizarre storyline, the eccentric characters, the brilliant visual style or the symbolism. The film's beginning is already bizarre and unique, and it gradually gets more surreal.El Topo (played by director Jodorowsky himself), a grim-looking, full-bearded gunfighter dressed all in black leather rides through the desert with his seven-year-old naked son (played by the directors son, Brontis Jodorowsky). In a ritual boy buries his only toy and a picture of his mother, and the two the ride on to a nearby town at which gruesome massacres are taking place... I would love to write more about this brilliant film's plot, but I don't want to give anything away, as I would hate to spoil any of the bizarre, and unforeseeable events that this film brings in its hypnotic 125 minutes, or even any of those in the first ten. This much, however, can be said: The world of Aleandro Jodorowsky's cinema is complex, surreal and fascinating beyond comparison, particularly in El Topo. Eccentric Characters like they can not be found in any other film, such as four 'masters of the desert', demented bandits or sadistic townspeople, appear in an unreal and demented world of weirdness, violence, symbolism and insanity. Jodorowsky's weird symbolism comes along with an incomparably surreal atmosphere, and it is not easy, no, not possible to determine what it all means - and it does not need to be - 'What the hell is going on?' is a question that one might ask oneself multiple times while watching ""El Topo"" - but in a manner that could not be more fascinating. The film is extremely violent in some parts, and surreal and insanely brilliant in all aspects. Other films by Jodorowsky, especially ""Santa Sangre"" (1989), also come with my highest recommendations, by the way. It is doubtable that a proper description of ""El Topo"" is even possible - This film really has to be seen to be believed! This bizarre masterpiece is one of the most unique cinematic experiences one can have, and an absolute must-see for everybody interested in cinema!",El Topo

27,JuguAbraham,Jodorowsky needs to work on his script with a sense of scholarship,4,9 November 2013,"I am a great admirer of directors/scriptwriters who understand religious works before they make films that refer to religion (e.g., Kieslowsky, Tarkovsky, Mallick, Reygadas, Bunuel, Bergman, Dreyer, etc.). Jodorowsky, in this film, proved that he neither knew Christian scriptures nor Buddhist philosophy. The only detail that showed some scholarship was the discussion on the Jewish name Marah. Jodorowsky was trying to be very erudite in calling sections of the film (a) genesis (b) the prophets (c) the psalms and (d) the apocalypse. While the first and the last section have some remote connection to the Bible, the screenplay proves Jodorowsky's total lack of knowledge to either parody or discuss the similarities with the narratives of his screenplay. What did Jodowsky's psalms have that related to/or referred even obliquely to the Psalms of David?His knowledge of the Oriental scriptures is equally muddled--one savant seems to be fascinated with Egyptology, building pyramids with sticks and having a man with no arms carrying another without any feet. Some have called the work surrealist--it would be that only if Jodorowsky had showed a glimpse of scholarship beyond the etymology of Marah. Even blood splattered walls do not look authentic, nor do visuals of pigs rushing out of an empty place of worship. This is immature cinema--Hollywood's ""Freaks"" was far superior in content and so was Bunuel's surrealist works that criticized organized religion.",El Topo
28,Xstal,Celebrate the Diversity of Your Imagination...,7,17 August 2020,An almost impossible film to quantify and as crazy today as the guy who conjured it up over 50 years ago. Is it a Western or Religion or both? Whatever it is it's sure to bend your mind.,El Topo
29,mstomaso,Of Gods and Guns,9,16 August 2008,"In this breathtaking mystical and spiritual western, Jodorowsky retells allegories of several religions to present his audience with an examination of the consequences of action based on every variety of human emotion. Lust, love, rape, compassion, murder, euthanasia, sacrifice, liberation, enslavement, faith, death, and procreation - few stones are left unturned in this desert.A highly skilled gunfighter who calls himself God travels through the desert with his son and visits the scene of massacre. Seeking righteous vengeance, he tracks down the perpetrators, and, having exacted revenge, abandons his son with a group of Franciscans and adopts the agenda of a woman he has freed from bondage because of his desire for her. This very generally covers the first quarter of the film, and the themes that are implied are re-examined several times throughout the film.El Topo (the mole, played by Joudorowsky) seeks the light, but as we learn in the opening sequence, the light will instantly blind him. His desires and the actions they inspire progress from primitive detached self-indulgence to redemptive self-sacrifice. He does wonderful things, and loathsome things, and the consequences of his actions are never as he intended. Thematically, the story hints at the connection between Taoist concepts of acting through inaction and mystical aspects of some western religions - simultaneously suggesting that only God can know the mind of God and that if no god exists, humans must acknowledge their dependence on the forces that govern the universe and seek harmony by yielding to them.Like most westerns, there is a great deal of killing and gun play in El Topo, and the death scenes are often grueling and over-dramatized. Unlike most westerns, however, none of this violence is pointless, and it is not the central action of the story.Jodorowski is a deeply spiritual film-maker, but is also intensely critical of organized religion and the demystification of religious ideas. He seemingly has little faith in the human ability to conceptualize cosmic forces. Notably, Jodorowsky never makes any statement whatsoever about science.The meta-narrative of El Topo can be read in many ways, and is the level at which the film achieves high art. Does the transparent allegory of El Topo's life suggest that the Judaeo-Christian god is, himself, blinded by the light and consumed by fires he himself starts? Does the more or less consistent inaction of His son indicate a way out of the catch-22 of causes and effects his actions have set in motion, or does his son's determination to take on the responsibilities and relationships of his father convert the son into a new embodiment of the mole? Or is it human ignorance, willfulness and wickedness which are responsible for all of miseries of human existence? Each thoughtful viewer will take away a different message.Gender is a major theme in El Topo, and although the main story is clearly presented from an androcentric perspective, Jodorowski adds a lot of details which effectively deconstruct this, and, in some cases, unmask it as an arbitrary convention of patriarchal religious doctrine. When you watch the film, pay particular attention to the voices and bodies of the different characters. I am convinced that these details are not simply added to jar and disorient. Finally, a comparison of the two main female characters - the loves of El Topo's life - is very important in 'getting' this film. One represents true love and true beauty, and the other illustrates something else. And it is significant that it is El Topo and El Topo alone, in his quest for the true path, who brings to his relationships a spiritual aspect. Considered without his self-proclaimed god-hood, there does not appear to be anything supernatural about these women or his relationship with them. Perhaps there is also a comment on agnosticism somewhere in all of this.Well acted (especially Jodorowski), beautifully shot, and excellently scripted, El Topo is a great film by a great, though eccentric, film maker.As a non-religious Taoist and scientist, I found it easy to contextualize Jodorowski's story and the messages it appears to carry. I do not, however, pretend that my interpretation is correct. To do so would be an act of violence against the film's art.If you're up for a brutal film which can not be enjoyed without a great of concentrated thought, I recommend it.",El Topo
30,KnightsofNi11,Mind blowing surreality,8,3 September 2012,"Writer, director, and actor Alejandro Jodorowsky's definitive cult Western is not a film that should be missed. It's a cerebral, surreal, and existential experience that will make you turn your head in confusion and widen your eyes in mystical awe. Jodorowsky stars as the title character, El Topo, a man wandering through the desert in search of spiritual enlightenment. He travels with his young son, played by Jodorowsky's real son Brontis, in search of four warrior masters that he must duel to complete his trans formative journey. But that's only the beginning. There's a lot more going on in El Topo that you have to experience for yourself.El Topo is the film that began the cult craze of Midnight Movies. These were taboo indie films screened at small independent theaters at midnight. El Topo established this midnight movie genre as something violent, strange, and disturbingly enthralling for the viewer. The film is an experience like no other, even if it is difficult to decipher just what it all means.Personally, I was awed by El Topo, but I didn't like it as much as Jodorowsky's next film, The Holy Mountain. El Topo is far more out there than The Holy Mountain, and it is increasingly difficult to grasp the purpose and the concept of the film as it gets stranger and stranger. Of course, this was the brain wracking spiritual experience Jodorowsky intended for the film, so he deserves plenty of kudos for making such a surreal mind freak of a film. It's independent filmmaking on a genius level that works on levels rarely explored in cinema.El Topo is truly cinema as a surreal art form. It may not all make sense, but that's what repeated viewings are for. I can't wait to watch El Topo a few more times to collect the interpretive meaning of the film in my mind. There's so much that El Topo has to offer, and it can definitely be a little overwhelming on the first viewing. But you can expect a mystical and almost magical experience when you watch this film.",El Topo
31,eminkl,"If you enjoy obscured, cult cinema",9,24 December 2019,"Alejandro Jodorowsky creates a stunning, visceral and action-packed Western movie that can be compared to some of the finest works of the genres. El Topo is a great film, an unprecedented film in its raw energy and direction of fluidity. Even acting is cult director Judorowsky, and he's making a film that's impressive in the way it displays its brutality. There was no other Western solution like Jodorowsky. This is a fine picture that is almost a forgotten classic of the genre, shot brilliantly, acting and with a great story. As far as Westerns are concerned, along with Once Upon a Time in the West, The Great, The Bad and The Ugly and The Wild Bunch, I would call El Topo one of the best. The film should definitely be rediscovered by fans of the genre, but this may not appeal to everyone because of some of its striking images. If you're looking for something in the genre that's a little different, El Topo is the movie to watch. Alejandro Jodorowsky is a great filmmaker, and he's not risking anything. His vision is stunning, relentless, and from the moment you start, El Topo's sheer raw power will grab your attention. The plot is well constructed and it's a movie that resonates well, because Jodorowsky makes a film that is very special in the Western genre, a film that reveals some concepts that are the hallmark of the director. El Topo is an enjoyable film, one of the finest in the genre, and if you've watched a lot of the Spaghetti Westerns, you'll certainly enjoy it. Thanks to its visuals, the film has a raw power that makes it unforgettable, and you're simply excited about what you see.

32,rzajac,An inescapably personal experience... in a movie theater,10,9 February 2019,"This flick is one of those that is definitely more than a mere 2D light show: There's something about the experience of it that makes it very, very personal; psychedelically like your presence in the theater, watching it, is very much a part of the reality of the film. El Topo caught me in a place and at a time.But... what I've said above could come off to some readers as at least as pretentious as they've come to see this movie. It deserves better from me.Here's what it is: I saw the movie on ""the big screen"" in a local art house joint, shortly after it came out... so I was 16 or 17 or so when I saw it.And it neatly concretized and confirmed my views on key things naturally on my mind as a kid who was trying to ramp up to be an adult contributor to ongoing dialog about matters of morals and policy in the American republic.And what are those ""key things""? They are: Being aware of hypocrisy and face-saving among my presumed ""political betters""; the limits of popular ""evangelical"" notions of spirituality; the complicity of those notions in masking/deflecting honest private reflection and righteous change; how to metabolize a shocking and challenging fantasy of on-the-ground comeuppance.That's a fair summary of the elements of El Topo which are clearly delineated in its exposition. And that's in spite of its arguable expressionistic excesses. It's a mixed bag, for sure: It has jarring imagery and swings to and fro... yet I have a distinct memory of a majestic, epic episodic block structure; an interminable portrayal of societal blindness and corruption... finally punctured thru with the advent of the sweet, innocent Christ figure, trying to gently bend that arc of corruption toward something less corrupt. Anyone telling you that the film is ""simply"" a mess is very likely a bit of a... simple person.El Topo is not simply a mess. It's not.I think that pretty much nails it, for me. It's one of those flicks that simultaneously reached out to touch me in a deeply personal--you might say subconscious way--and at the same time reflects a thoroughgoing interest in the usual nutsy-boltsy expectations associated with narrative craft. Kudos for that!Oddly, this analysis obviates the usual downstream encouragement to all and sundry to hie themselves to the art house or DVD/Blueray emporium for forthwith delectation. Like I said: My experience of El Topo felt very participatory. Can you participate today?Well... Who's to say? Maybe you should try to see it, and find out for yourself.",El Topo

You wondered what the hell was going on, but never looked away.A gunfighter and his naked child take on the best gunfighters there are. Why? To be the BEST! There's Jodorowsky's usual use of cripples and amputees in support roles.

The children began fighting over the food, snarling at each other, etc. The Alchemist tells the thief, ""all the food in the world is useless if they are not ready to share"".If you haven't seen the movie yet, ignore that, but if you have think about the mole going into the light prematurely and blinding itself at the beginning (and others ancient stories of Caves and temporary blindness?), about what the gunmen is attempting to do for the people underground, and why it goes wrong? Anyway it's food for thought.

There is a lot of symbolism which I understand to some extent but mostly it feels just like random images put there just for the sake of randomness. I may be wrong. There may be a strong message underneath. But overall it feels too quirky and psychedelic to me. Just like cover artworks of progressive rock albums...a monkey is in a telephone that is in a toothbrush that is in an airplane... that kind of feeling. The randomness goes too far. And I think there is a limit how deep a movie's message can be. If you have to search through all the literature in the world to understand one darn flick then that's too much.

That aside, El Topo is a surreal, dreamy journey of inner self realization. It is also a blood soaked, ultra violent assault on the senses. The choice of partaking said such psychedelic drugs before seeing this is your own choice. It has been described by some as a Zen western, a drug induced homage to Sergio Leone,as well as others. Jodorowsky has made several other films just as bizarre & surreal as El Topo, but due to spotty distribution, are not as well known. This film was discovered by John Lennon in 1970, who begged his then manager Allen Klein to distribute the film in the U.S., where it mostly played to stoned out hippies in the early 1970's at midnight screenings. The film then disappeared for years (sometimes turning up on bootlegged VHS video copies),and was rescued from obscurity by Jodorowsky, himself who oversaw a new print struck, and distributed out of his own pocket.

Alejandro Jodorowsky divides his script into parts with allusions to bible passages, and part of it to the foot in front of his journey, it is, his journey, since the protagonist called El Topo is interpreted by the director himself, in addition, his script seems to be personal, as if Jodorowsky wanted to tell a little of his journey, since he is known in the cycles of occultism and magic as well as being a scholar of theology, for, Jodorowsky takes an extreme assessment with blood, sex, violence, drama and comedy. ""El Topo"" has its very marked and different acts, which helps in a long rhythm, since films so artistic and subjective have a complicated rhythm, ""El Topo"" goes against this, the film goes fast, because is an attention of the viewer, and when we finish, it seems that 4 hours have passed, but not by the slow pace, but it is by the excess of information and history that we witnessed in only two hours of film, which is a great merit of the long, Perfect.
""The mole, an animal that digs to seek the light, and with it becomes blind."" This phrase is not a gift for our search for a text, but rather a simple phrase and a journey of our protagonist. , a messianic journey of a sacred man who performs miracles while performing justice and seeks knowledge about the guardians who represent philosophies and religions, as well as the trap to overcome them, as well as deep knowledge, but not the complete behind of its later debts, besides allegories that play with the different religions and philosophies the film has a human character and of great intensity, I do not have the capacity to perhaps annul, to explain completely a work of Jodorowsky. A very rich film of sense and detail, sensations and metaphors.
Technically, Jodorowsky conducted his western in an excellent way, with clear inspirations in Sergio Leone, Jodorowsky does not leave anything out in his western that here, escaping from the traditional does not pass old Mexican and not American, and even this never being explicit, fans of the good western repair the details of the western created by Jodorowsky, a mystical and lonely western, we feel bad like the scenery, it is like something wrong, it is a construction of the scenery, the use of open plans All the moments to demonstrate a grandiosity of nothingness, an almost inhospitable environment and cruel to be human, as well as making a wonderful costumes, great sound tracks that are a 70's face, that half sadistic melody that complements our journey well, of course, the good performances, especially of Jodorowsky as ""El topo where we perceive that the character has the knowledge of his character, he can also, just live his character, with his solutions and objectives, a highlight also for Mara Lorenzio.

Even after 44 years, this movie still has the power to shock and or charm the viewer through imagery and symbolism that is essential Jodorowsky. So much so that one should catch up with the dream landscape paintings of Salvador Dali, and crack open various tales of religion and folklore because ""El Topo"" has plenty. Even now it's ambiguous what could be represented without forcing an answer.Kind of split into two parts, which has been linked to the Old and New Testament. It begins with a black clad figure roaming the desert on his horse accompanied by his young (naked) son, who doesn't seem to be fazed by the brutal slaughters they encounter on their travels. After the father has claimed his victory from the perpetrator, the imprisoned lady convinces El Topo to abandon his son and set out to defeat the four great gun masters in the West, becoming the greatest gunman of the land. Each master is of different ethnicity & religion, who begin to make El Topo question his motives thoroughly. What I can only imagine is the Adam & Eve story, a female stranger comes to their oasis and joins them in their quest, leading all involved to more mirages and ecstasy of the flesh. Reaching the end of his mission, events unfold which arguably set up the redemption & rebirth of the character.Years later. Our protagonist awakens in a cave full of deformed people, who have nurtured him and worship him as a deity of sorts. Upon leaving the mountain and accompanied by a dwarf woman, he learns the town nearby is populated by a bunch of surreal, aristocratic cultists who trapped the people in the mountain, whom are lacking the physical capabilities to escape. El Topo (Adopting a Buddhist appearance, after a spiritual rebirth) and his friend begin planning to help their people by performing in the streets in exchange for petty cash, in turn to purchase dynamite. During their time families form and re-unite, beliefs are toppled and the motivations for peace are a violent, double edged sword.One could say it's indulgent for a man to direct, write, star and craft the music for his picture. However, on repeated viewings of the directors extraordinary filmography, anything else would feel unjust. ""El Topo"" does right by not forcing it's symbolism upon you, and it's imagery continues to hold up incredibly well throughout its two-hour running length.Final Verdict: Something raw prevails in ""El Topo"", that sets it apart from anything I've ever watched. Arguably it's going to be one of those films I'll highly recommend to my friends, continue to prove foreign cinema is a powerful force of imagination outside of the western world, and is right now finding a spot on my all time top 20 favourite films. 9/10. An experience vital to any film-maker.",El Topo
43,Varlaam,A Buñuelian spaghetti western,7,25 November 1999,"This film may be rarely shown elsewhere, but it has never been hard to see in Toronto. It's been screened on a semi-regular basis at the Bloor Cinema for the past 20 years or so. But last night was the first exposure for me.Luis Buñuel had a significant career in Mexico through the '50's up to the mid-'60's. Perhaps there is some direct connection to director Alejandro Jodorowsky, perhaps not. But this film has a very strong flavour of Buñuel, his religious themes, his absurdity. I think the profoundest parallels may lie in ""L'âge d'or"" (1930), but there seem to be allusions to ""Un chien andalou"" (1929) and maybe echoes of ""La voie lactée"" (1969) too. Perhaps others even.How is a sheep on a tower like a cow elevated on a bed? They're both incongruous and ridiculous. One is Jodorowsky, one is Buñuel. Or a crucified sheep on a wall vs. a dead donkey on a piano. A swarm of bees, a handful of ants. Incongruous would also be the victrola which appears a couple of times, or the butterfly net. They both remind me anyway of the tennis racquet -- that mocking symbol of French civilization in decline -- from ""Un chien andalou"".Jodorowsky's character of the Colonel bears quite a resemblance once he's fully dressed to the officer in the Germaine Dulac / Antonin Artaud film ""La coquille et le clergyman"" from 1927. Jodorowsky even has the Colonel sit in a confessional at one point, for goodness' sake.So that's why I think this film in its early stages at least is a conscious homage to the great French surrealist films. Certainly that piggyback amputee composite character is one that Buñuel must have wished he (or Dalí) had thought of. Go for your gun!The rest extrapolates from and carries on that absurdist style, incorporating the sexuality, the shocks from that artistic movement, and adding the enhanced violence of the 1960's.What does ""El topo"" mean? With its fertility symbols, its old whores. Goats represent the souls of the wicked, according to a verse in St. Matthew. Could that be relevant? Maybe.Well, what did any of those influential films of the 1920's ""mean""? At that time, they were on assault on conventionality, established norms, bourgeois values.Precise meaning may not be the point.But I can certainly tell you what got the biggest laugh from the audiencelast night -- the cactus pear scene. Even bigger than the iguanas, if you can believe it. Hi-ho, Silver!",El Topo
44,TheCorniestLemur,"Yee haw, lord",7,14 October 2021,"That was definitely...a film.I don't know what else this is, other than being absolutely part of those peculiar weird films I just love giving 7/10s to for some reason, and when I call this a weird film, I mean it is neck deep in weirdness, and I don't like the look of that snorkel it's putting on.But even though I have less than no idea what it all means, if anything at all, for at least half of it I was nevertheless pretty glued to it. I do kind of feel like it goes completely off the rails into something only tangentially related to what it was doing before in its second half, and if I ever watch it again I am going to be doing quite a bit of reading about what all the symbolism could mean, but for a first watch and knowing nothing about it, I did enjoy it quite a bit.As long as you don't ask me to talk about the narrative, there's a lot about this I can definitively say that I like - all the performances are pretty memorable, it's directed and shot really well, the production design is surprisingly great for such a barren landscape that makes up most of this film (and by the way if knowing how to shoot in a desert was the only reason Jodorowsky was at one point going to adapt Dune, I'm kind of glad that never happened, because I don't think someone who made these kinds of films would have done justice to that book in all honesty), and the costume design is really amazing.As for things I know are definitely negatives, something about how every single oppressed group of people this film depicts is treated in it feels...a little gross to me, but given how many religious connotations I hear this film has, this could very well be a criticism of religion's part in keeping these groups marginalised...I guess. I don't know, but on a first watch it felt weird to me.Also my god does the sound design in certain scenes obnoxiously screw you in the ear, and it should really cut that out, but overall, this was certainly...interesting. And, dare I say it, entertaining for quite a while. I'm not sure what it is about this that kept my attention when so many other films with plots I find hard to follow (intentionally or otherwise) lose it pretty quickly, but I think it's a good sign for a future rewatch at least.Maybe I've just been playing too much Red Dead Redemption 2 recently and think the fluffy fedora man with a six shooter looks really cool, but I do think there is something to this film even if I don't get it, which is always a nice feeling to have with something like this.",El Topo
45,Maleplatypus,An absurd theater of absurd,2,9 November 2011,"This movie (!?) reminded me of Monty Python, although it is not as nearly funny and clever. Apparently, in those days any number of shoots collected and somehow put together has been regarded as ""movie"". And got ""cult"" status instantly. This approach still has faithful followers nowadays (see - or don't - The Orphan Killer, paranormal Acticity, Blair Witch and such). And the less sense it makes, it is considered more ""artistic"". Like, acting is a shame, editing is something not worth bothering, and directing means (probably) explaining to the participants what they should do (or otherwise, if they do not feel like it) over a large amount of alcohol. Don't get me wrong: this movie (!?) has its moments and is a material worth remaking (by Terry Gilliam, for instance) but this... Jesus! Surreal? Introspective? Thoughtful? My ass! Plain stupid. Forget about it. It's that simple.",El Topo
46,masercot,An Epic Fantasy of Peace and Magic,10,13 November 2008,"I don't normally rate a movie a ten, but this movie deserves it.The concept of taking Zen parables, presenting them in spaghetti-western form and adding enough Christian imagery to make a dozen ""Omen"" movies is so far out that one cannot imagine it getting past the first producer's meeting in this day and age. If this director wasn't an inspiration to Oliver Stone, then, there are two dangerously insane people running around and directing movies.Cripples and amputees adorn this movie like baubles on a Christmas tree...REAL amputees...REAL dead and dying animals for that matter. It gives the movie a decadent, dream-like feel. Essentially a three-part film, the first two parts reek of death; whereas, the third part reeks of insanity.The dwarven love-interest introduced in the third part of the movie is beautiful, perhaps because, although she plays her role because she is a dwarf, she plays it like an actress.Not for kiddies, but adults, check it out!",El Topo
47,Afracious,An obscure western with a difference,10,29 October 1999,"This was Alexandro Jodorowsky's first recognised cult movie in the early seventies. Shot in Mexico, El Topo (or the mole in English) is a gunslinger (played by Jodorowsky), who, dressed completely in black leather, rides on his horse with his seven-year-old son through the desert; until they come across a massacre of people. One of the survivors tells El Topo who the culprits are, and he then takes on the guise of God and seeks revenge. There is a lot of surrealistic imagery from then on as Jodorowsky explores violence, racism and religious themes, but it is absorbing and the ending is very obscure. An easy candidate for a cult movie.",El Topo
48,NateManD,A religious allegorical western of redemption with surrealist imagery.,10,12 July 2005,"""El Topo"", is probably Jodorowsky's most talked about film next to ""Santa Sangre"". Like all his films it is bizarre and full of symbolism. El Topo is a cowboy dressed in black. He is out for vengeance, kind of like the Biblical God of the old testament. Him and his son ride through a town of massacred civilians. He wants justice and to win the heart of a girl, Mara. He gives up his only son, in an act that could be looked at like God, or even Abraham. He has to kill seven master gunfighters. After all the violence and carnage, he is injured and taken under the care of cripples, dwarfs and other various misfits. He is reborn, almost like a Bhuddist monk. He becomes like the new testament God, Jesus Christ. El Topo is now like a savior to the oppressed. He vows to dig a tunnel out of the cave so the cripples can live among the villagers. The town is taken over by religious fanatics. Poor villagers are branded with the religious icon by force. An upper class of elitists now dominate the town. ""El Topo"" is beautiful, and chocked full of violent and disturbing imagery. The film became a popular cult sensation in the early 70's. It was embraced by the likes of John Lennon, Dennis Hopper, Jack Nicholson, Peter Gabriel and Pink Floyd. More recently celebrities like Marilyn Manson and the Coen Brothers have talked about being strongly influenced by Jodorowsky's work. ""El Topo"" is important, because it was the first midnight movie. If people could forget about ""the Rocky Horror Picture Show"" just for a second, they'd realize that this is one of the most important cult films. A bizarre and surreal western that can never be imitated. The only 3 surreal westerns I can think of to pre-date ""El Topo"" that have many similarities are Brazilian director Glauber Rocha's ""Black God, White Devil"" (1964) and his follow up ""Antonio Das Mortes"" (1969) and the Italian Spaghetti western ""Django, Kill if you Live, Shoot"" (1967).",El Topo
49,denis-23791,Incredible imagination gone wild,6,15 February 2021,"A bizarre and surrealist, allegoric epos full of violence, sex and crazy storylines that claim to have biblical resonance. The ideas are intriguing and could be considered funny, but it's hard to make out emotions or a plot that could be taken seriously. Very impressive image construction and choreography. The acting is in line with the absurd whole and dialogues are mostly dubbed, often with male voices for female characters. Too slow and long to claim true suspense.",El Topo
50,Billy_Crash,Ludicrous and Nonsensical,1,3 August 2010,"I usually love the avant-garde, the offbeat, the strange and the surreal. Being a fan of David Lynch, Takashi Miike and Terry Gilliam, bring me the weird and bizarre – but do not bring me ""El Topo"". This midnite movie cult classic is one of those films I had been told was a ""must see"", though I knew it was not that easy. Most viewers either love or hate the movie with no in between. Jodorowsky delivered as writer/director/actor/composer a mixed bag of metaphor, allegory, imagery, spaghetti western, fantasy, horror and utter gore, weighed down with Buddhism and Christianity, and just about anything else from the philosophical and metaphysical kitchen sink. The aforementioned is fine, but when the final destination for the audience is nowhere, I can understand the passionate hatred from those who despise the film. Of its lovers, many told me it was ""trippy"" and they simply liked it because of that.The narrative, however, is all over the place as El Topo (The Mole) travels the Mexican desert to face and kill The Four Masters of the Desert. Do they represent the Four Horsemen, the Four Winds, the Four Elements? It is anybody's guess. The movie is so loaded with imagery upon imagery it is as if Jodorowsky was purposefully stirring the pot just to keep people guessing. Maybe as lovers of the film try to decipher the layers of meaning, Jodorowsky is laughing somewhere. This film did not satisfy me on any level because the result was a pile of primordial ooze that did not have time to gel into something coherent. Granted, I was intrigued by Topo's Zen-like transformation, especially when he worked so diligently to save the deformed cripples, but this was not enough to justify what came beforehand.The movie is a circus sideshow with bits and pieces that are at times amusing while disgusting on other occasions. In this vein, Jodorowsky delivered the grotesque on a tortilla. At times both ridiculous and frightening, he shocks the audience with a stream of phantasmagorical scenes that lead only to the end credits and nothing more. Whatever Jodorowsky was searching for, it was for him and him alone. The movie was self- indulgent and left me amazingly disappointed.I can sit and discuss Lynch's disturbing ""Eraserhead"", Miike's over-the-top ""Visitor Q"" and Gilliam's Orwellian ""Brasil"", but Jodorowsky's work leads to a dead end because it is utterly nonsensical.",El Topo

He then falls in love with a woman and he fights down 3 great warriors of the land to achieve his enlightenment through violence. One leader is a blind man who is served by a man with no legs on top of a man with no arms (weird stuff, folks). He eventually gets shot and left for dead by his lesbian wife, where he wakes up enlightened and worshiped in a lotus pose. A bunch of freaks in a mountain take care of him. He eventually digs a tunnel so all the freaks can escape. However, the mean and violent townspeople kill the freaks and El Topo sets himself aflame after he kills the townspeople. His wife and son walk away.Its a great movie and i find there is so much to learn about and lots of symbolism every time i see it.",El Topo
52,tsf-1962,Sergio Leone on acid,10,2 December 2006,"If you're into Zen gunfighters, lesbian cowgirls, enslaved dwarfs and pistol-packing Jesus freaks, this is the movie for you. ""El Topo"" may well be the greatest movie ever made; it's certainly one of the strangest. It's no wonder it became a counterculture classic, or that John Lennon considered it his favorite movie. So much has been written about ""El Topo,"" its symbolism, its meaning, its violence, that the movie itself has gotten lost in the confusion. To put it simply ""El Topo"" is a western, and a darn good one. Sure, it's not exactly John Ford, but anyone who can enjoy and appreciate the films of Sergio Leone, Sam Peckinpah, or Clint Eastwood should be able to enjoy it. For 75% of the movie we have a fairly traditional ""spaghetti western"" with an added serving of nudity and violence; renaissance man Alexandro Jodorowsky, who not only wrote, directed, and stars in this film but also designed the sets and costumes and composed the fabulous score, is obviously indebted to Sergio Leone's masterpieces, but he adds to the mix a surrealist sensibility quite at home with Mexican culture (remember Bunuel?) and an eclectic spirituality that embraces the Bible and Zen with equal enthusiasm. Only in the last thirty minutes does it become really disturbing, but even then the violence is tame by today's standards. Jodorowsky, who bears an eerie resemblance to Bruce Willis, was the ""man in black,"" a gunfighter-avenger who bears more than a passing resemblance to Clint Eastwood's ""Man With No Name""; the later part of the movie, when he becomes a Buddhist monk on a mission of vengeance, must have been the inspiration for the popular TV series ""Kung Fu."" The color photography was beautiful, the gunfights exciting, the characters unique. The DVD I watched was in English with Japanese subtitles, which added to the film's mystique.",El Topo

It is best to give up during the first scene and to let your eyes be the guide for the next two hours. It's biblical, it's mythological. It's likely that everything means something, but I am not the right person to consult here. It's a test for an open mind, a test to see at exactly which point your brain explodes. This is Jodorowsky's movie as he did so much in it. Only he could guide you, but he doesn't want to. So all you have to do is put the tape in your VCR, sit or lie down and absorb the next two hours.

I wonder what he'd think of cruelty to animals for film-making purposes, as we see in Jodorowsky's 'El Topo.'Jodorowsky is not alone of course nor, of his works, is 'El Topo'. In Robert Bresson's 'Au hasard Balthazar' the eponymous donkey has a firecracker tied to its tail and lit. Through the donkey's distress, Bresson wanted to make a comment about Jesus or something. For a scene in 'Andrei Rublev,' Tarkovsky had a horse shot in the neck and rammed down a flight of steps. The horse was on its way to the knacker's yard anyway, Tarkovsky reasoned.'El Topo' is cited as the first cult film of the 1970s. It was championed by John Lennon no less. Though Lennon's plausibility as an arbiter of taste has to be called into question. (Y'know, Yoko.) But the film is garbage, a fever dream of bits and pieces picked up here and there. For example, the man holding the lamp in the daylight, a nod to Diogenes of Sinope... It's a carnival of all gods and myths, as was once said.The film's look is a fusion of 'A Fistful of Dollars' and Pasolini's 'Oedipus Rex' and this is the most interesting aspect of the film. Maybe if it were viewed in the ambience of the 1960s, and through the LSD-colored spectacles of same, we'd somehow see it as meaningful. Just as nowadays, the woke lens allows the woke to see profundity in the most abject nonsense.I don't have a crystal balls or indeed a crystal ball but I feel the destiny of Jodorowsky awaits a number of present-day cult filmmakers. For some it will happen when they lie a-moldering in the grave. Not that they'll care, of course. ""The race is not to the swift..."" etc. They will rest (in peace) on their laurels.Alejandro Jodorowsky has said, and this quote can be found here on the IMDB, ""Most directors make films with their eyes. I make films with my balls."" In support of his claim I'll add that his films certainly give off the stench of fetid underwear. Especially under those leather pants. Ugh.",El Topo

The trouble is that often this startling imagery doesn't really refer to anything in reality.But I suppose thats no bad thing - after all, why should film have to mean something all of the time?Even so, Jodorowsky knew that narrative is what the viewer yearns for and all of the shock and awe value in the world can't really distract from this aspect of the film slowly down far too quickly.  It really drags on a bit.A prototype for the superior 'The Holy Mountain', but still worth a considred look.",El Topo
59,Chris J.,"Unique, brutal, fascinating, allegory of many religions..",10,12 November 1998,"It's a violent, brutal, to some confusing, but fascinating and ultimately a brilliant allegorical film. It was the first of the midnight cult films.Unrelenting at times.  There are several characters and situations the protagonist experiences. Each of these characters and situations have a connection to various (mostly Eastern) religions.  The feel of the first part is almost like a mid-period Fellini spaghetti western (had Fellini made a spaghetti western--which he did not).  The second half of the film has an entirely different feel, message and pacing.  The second half of the film is an allegory of the New Testament.  Eventually it does all tie together however.There seems to be a scene missing at about the mid-point of the film, and a characters motivation suddenly changes.   Jodorowsky explained it was mostly intentional, but, two shots were ruined and never re-shot which would have helped set up a more discernible meaning to the scene in question.  It occurs between the women in the desert.Jodorowsky will not explain in detail all that he was going for in the film.  He considers the film an Eastern.... he agrees that my interpretation of various characters embodying Eastern religion and philosophy is correct.   He also was creating a film of emotions, violence, salvation, and redemption---so he intentionally did not follow the expected structure of most films regarding first, second and third acts and when major conflicts occur.He flippantly agreed with some New York critics years ago who described the film as one which seemed to be a filmed version of a very strange L.S.D. trip.  He had a lengthy conversation which was published and used as liner notes in the El TOPO soundtrack album which talked about the film in terms of it being something akin to a LSD trip.   But Jodorowsky said, you certainly don't need LSD to enjoy it, it's already been done for you.This was not something he was serious about it.  But being 1969,  and after having trouble getting a distributor for the film in the first place, and now watching the film having moderate success as a midnight cult film and amongst college students he decided it was good for the film to agree that the N.Y. critics were partially correct.It is at times an extremely disturbing film. I thought I detected more than a little of misogyny in the film-- --however, as Jodorowsky essentially told me--none has been intended, except that the world now, like in the past, has always brutalized women and men have insisted on brutalizing themselves.Seeing it with an audience in a theater also means you can discuss it with people of all types.  Reactions to the film are all over the map.  Most agree it is art---- many don't like the film---many find it too disturbing, too violent, too sacrilegious, too scattered. Others disagree over the various messages and meanings they receive from the film. Others just 'enjoy' it as a wild, weird, disturbing film.Usually video copies of the film are from Japanese laserdiscs which fog all pubic hair.  It looks strange if you are not familiar with this.It is a film akin to an Opera.  Although it was extremely low-budget, the film is an epic and has, if not a big budget feel to it,  an impressive grandeur and sweep that few films achieve.Filmed over a course of nearly three years, the filmmakers twice were stranded for weeks without supplies and without money.  This film was started in 1964/65, completed and originally set for release in 1967/68, it predates The Wild Bunch, Easy Rider and other 60's landmarks....     It was a true labor of love to finish the film.  And then the film was banned in several countries.It is not in general release.  For many years from the late 70's to the mid 90's it was rarely if ever shown.A few years ago I revisited the film in a theatre and had the opportunity to discuss it as an audience member and later on one with Jodorowsky.   His other film Sante Sangre is also quite good in my opinion, but I am not a fan of his Holy Mountain. Other films he has been involved with are of lesser value. He was a good friend of Fellini's and may someday direct Fellini's script of Don Quixote.  He is working on Son of El Topo, but not sure when it will be released and who will distribute it.El Topo began a nearly 5 year run as a midnight film and often sold out. It started in a small Greenwich Village theatre in New York City. After a few years of success in NYC, other prints were distributed to college campuses and for midnight shows in other cities.  It became a modest hit!",El Topo

The bloodshed, however, is not the most unusual element of this venture into bizzaro world. The plot is hard to explain because it totally changes half way through the movie. It also has some fantasy/religious/cult elements that are way out the norm for westerns. All I can say is that El Topo is the vision of a mad man. It's got lesbianism, emasculation, midget breasts, butt-rape, slavery, tons of deformed people, and even a little kid getting his head blown off.

There are scenes where characters change roles and appearance between shots, that change rather quickly. This isn't the reason the film is hard to wrap your head around. A lot of it has to do with the religious imagery. The film is filled with it as well as several bible verses. It seems as though different points are being made at different points in the movie, and that those points point to other matters which don't exist in the film. Starting to get the point? The film takes a more typical western feel near the beginning with the black gunman (EL Topo). This segment of the movie is action film and has a lot of the hooks of Western Genre Films (as well as 70's art house hooks). Later on the film takes a very different turn and feels a lot less like a western. Our main character acts and looks completely differently and his motivations are almost opposite in every way. We only feel the story cutting back together as El Topo reunites with a character earlier in the movie.The film has a superb visual flair and is littered with many types of religious imagery and symbolism.

63,crappydoo,Not as awesome as they say but good nevertheless.,6,1 April 2008,"How does one write a review for El Topo? It is such a personal experience that I will write my own opinion of the movie.For certain, I was chuckling almost throughout the film but it was not because of the jokes on screen but due to the unreal sequences and nonsense that was going on. I loved the way the people spouted blood. I also loved the bizarre courtship rituals. However I am pretty certain that in most of these scenes Jodorowski was trying to create a very serious environment. For instance the scene with the exploitation of the monks was intended to be shocking and a serious comment on society; but it turns out to be hilarious due to the bad acting and bizarreness.Some more things that I gathered was that the director was fairly chauvinistic and egoistic. What with writing a film and casting oneself as an all-powerful messiah who is irresistible to women and unbeatable in gun fights. Not to mention highly philosophical and a saviour. Ah, talking of women, they are nothing more than objects rather than humans. They are depicted as dogs that are meant for satisfaction and the worship of men. I'm not too sure where the director was trying to go with this.I am a big fan of surreal art; however surrealism is an attempt towards straightening out preconceived societal norms and blind faith. I am not too certain what comment was the director trying to make in this film. All I gathered was that he was self-indulgent and trying to depict himself the way he saw himself in his own eyes, as a superior alpha-male, which shows his huge ego.Towards the end I started falling asleep and couldn't wait for it to get over. I thought that the movie was half-an-hour too long and it couldn't maintain my interest for 2 hours.Would I watch the movie again, I probably would because it is indeed very funny. However I'm not too certain if I'd like to give The Holy Mountain a go primarily because I presume that it also will be as religious as this one was. So a good attempt and I'd recommend this movie to others interested in bizarre films; however its not one of the greatest ones I've seen. Funny though........I saw The Holy Mountain 2 weeks after writing this review and was absolutely stunned by it. Certainly far superior in quality, grandeur and bravado than this one. Cheers.",El Topo
64,slawman,Baffling and unforgettable,8,10 December 1999,"Jodorowsky is nothing if not an idiosyncratic filmmaker, and this is probably the ideal starting point for his singular flights of fancy.  The tightrope that this movie walks from first frame to last is almost unparalleled in modern cinema.""El Topo"" is as pretentious as it is meaningful and as baffling as it is gripping.  In a way it is an examination of various religions of the world (particularly Eastern ones), in another way it is a tribute to Bunuel and the surrealists, in another way it's simply an insane LSD vision.  No matter which of these you walk in expecting, you'll be satisfied.It is unfortunate that a key scene in the film is missing, which does play havoc with some of the character motivations (though there is no conventional ""plot"", what's motivating the characters most of the time is VERY clear).  Even with this omission, the film has a power and grace which few epics (let alone controversial ""midnight cult"" features) have achieved. 
I do own a copy of what is probably a ""grey market"" videocassette of the film taken from a Japanese laserdisc, and the image quality is generally not bad (it never was great with this movie, anyway).  Plus, those Japanese subtitles sure are interesting!",El Topo
65,thepartyoftea,Not the Feel Good Movie of the year...,7,5 November 2006,"El Topo (1970) Rough, hard and dirty, this might describe many things, but it perfectly describes ""El Topo"". Shot in the deserts of Mexico, ""El Topo"" is a hard film containing graphic violence, sex and weirdness that is still shocking to this day. The film opens with a naked boy burring his favorite toy and a picture of his mother and is told today he becomes a man, an almost prelude to the adult material to follow. Shortly after the opening scene a single dead horse is shown, the audience feels a little sad, but the shot after shows an entire town butchered and fresh blood everywhere. The audience knows this is not going to be a feel good movie.""El Topo"" is a movie that fits into several different genres at the same time, it looks and begins like a western, but quickly changes to a quest to rid the 4 gun masters in the desert is eerie similar to a kung fu movie, then the film takes another turn and turns into a drama and a bit lighter after The Mole falls in love with the midget woman. There are acts of comedy that reflect back to the early silent era.Film genres isn't the only way ""El Topo"" reflects pop culture, the film also makes several references to religious symbols and stories and events from around the world. The most eye catching is the reference to Thích Quảng Đức, a Buddhist monk who burnt himself alive in an interestion in Vietnam in 1963, who also burnt up without saying anything or moving a muscle.The masters in the desert all have symbols and they down grade throughout the journey, the first master had a tower and a huge oasis, the second master had a wagon and a river, the third master had a little cover and a water hole, the fourth had a pole, a blanket and a sheet. The weapons also downgraded as well, the first had two guns, the second had one that could shoot several bullets, the third had one gun that could only fire one gun before reloading, the fourth only had a butterfly net. The masters of the desert were all tricked into being killed, the first one fell and was shot, he used to live high in a tower, the second master was tricked when the Mole sprinkled glass on the ground and hurt the second master's mother. The third was tricked by using body armor ashtray. The fourth master killed himself and stopped the Mole from winning the battle. One other interesting piece of symbolism of the masters is the second and third master, the second master is wearing sheep and owns a lion and the third master has a rabbit farm. The rabbit, the lamb and the lion all play huge roles in Christianity.The Mole is a strong symbol, he wears black and wherever he goes, death follows. When the Mole fights the third master all but three rabbits are dead because of the presence of the Mole. When the Mole is betrayed by his two women companions, for not paying enough attention to them, the women kill him. After being in a coma for years the Mole goes through a transformation change and shaves all of his hair and appears to look like a new born baby and takes on another task, to help the deformed people escape their hole. Unlike the his previous quest, his quest to free the deformed people is not for revenge but thanks for taking care of him. After working with one of the midget women, the Mole falls in love with her and soon she becomes pragent. After awhile the Mole, the dwarf woman and the Mole's first son finally finish the tunnel and release the other deformed people. When the deformed people are killed, the Mole reverts back to his original ways and kills the entire town.With blood and violence, love and sexuality littered everywhere with a huge amount of historical and religious references, ""El Topo"" feels extremely rough, but at the same time can not be looked away from.",El Topo

68,f. baez,Needs specific conditions to be seen,4,13 September 1999,"The following annecdote is true:One teenage afternoon my friend Victor told me we must go see El Topo, the greatest film of all times. He had seen it the day before and was stunned. I was fond of Alexandro's ""Fabulas Panicas"" in the sunday newspaper (a cow wanting to become a cube, and the sort), so I went on with enthusiasm.The film is stuffed with stuff, and lets anyone be his own interpreting ""genius"" of the goulash he's presented with. It tries to impress wellthinkers, and succeeds. It's full of sound and fury (and dozen of ounces of red paint), but signifies nothing. A few striking images rest in the mind, a few phrases, already read in the ""Fabulas"". And the sensation of being utterly cheated.As we left the theatre, Victor confessed:""It sucks, man, but I didn't realize it yesterday. I was on acid"".That's one specific condition in which you can enjoy (and maybe think you grasp) El Topo. Other one, if you remained ""forever"" (that is, stoned for life). The third and last, if you ego as an intellectual is too big to admit you were fooled like a baby by an artist of fakery.",El Topo
69,Zoomorph,"Sparse, minimalist religious symbolism",2,11 July 2016,"As someone not too interested in religious symbolism, I did not enjoy this film. It's sparse and minimalist and very little happens in 2 hours. There's not much offered to the viewer other than a very brief story that appears to be some kind of metaphor pertaining to religion. The meaning isn't obvious either, so you're just watching some weird, meaningless stuff unless you put thought into it and try to come up with your own explanation. It's not particularly visually beautiful or engaging in other ways.I can see how this could be an interesting film for people who are interested in Christianity and enjoy these kinds of exercises, although I suspect this is a film that receives a lot of spurious praise from people who like it just because it's so out there or because they think that's the cool thing to do.

71,ELB-6,How the West was Surreal,8,29 September 2007,"I have been a fan of Santa Sangre ever since it first came out in theaters. (I have been eagerly awaiting its release on DVD) When El Topo was released on DVD I snapped it up right away and gave it a watch last night.First off, knowing the time period this movie came from, I have to say that Jodorowski was years ahead of his time. That said, I think many of his images and intent owe as much to Dali and Dada artists than to other filmmakers. The scene where the rabbit pyre bursts into flames is pure surreal imagery. It was at this moment that I decided: I like this film.It does seem as if this is two films spliced together. The first half is a revenge story/spiritual quest (if tracking down people and killing them can be seen as spiritual) This half seems less successful in its narrative and approach than the second half of the film.The second half finds the re-invented and shorn El Topo rescuing a community of in-bred freaks trapped inside a cave. (I say 'freaks' not disparagingly, but because they resemble a carnival sideshow more than anything else) I read another comment that said the second half was a 'New Testament allegory.' I don't see that at all. What I see is an allegory between Mexico and the US, Mexico being those trapped in the cave and the US being the fat, over-dressed citizens of the town decorated with eye-within-the-pyramid banners. This new El Topo and his beloved are forced to beg and clown for a living, and clean toilets, and wash windows. When they finally do break through the wall to the cave and the 'freaks' venture forth into the town, they are all shot and killed. Maybe this appears to be an allegory for how the US treats Mexican immigrants when seen today, given the ironic difficulties so many Americans have with immigrants. Even so, it made a very strong impression on me. All in all, I think Santa Sangre is a much more full, rich, imaginative and cohesive film. It is interesting to see many of the same themes from El Topo in Santa Sangre: right of passage into manhood, armless people using another's arms as his own, physically and mentally challenged people, magic tricks, circus music and, of course, a lot of bloodshed. I wish this filmmaker would make more movies.",El Topo

It was fresh to watch this kind of film that would be politically highly uncorrect nowadays. Also the absence of special effects makes the movies of the 1970s so real.The world of El Topo is weird, almost a fantasy, but is actually just a caricature of our own. Symbolism is strong in this movie. It also pinpoints some ugly things in our society. The story is divided into two rather different episodes which is a good decision. Bad and good, and good doesn't necessarily prevail.As a movie it's still a bit hard to watch at some points. Some actors are not that good and it takes time to tune yourself to the weird world of the movie. Dubbing is ridiculous at times. It's a movie with full of holes in it, just like your dreams. Just try to forget those and it will be an enjoyable ride.",El Topo
78,petcrows,a crow/raven snuff film,1,15 July 2007,"Prior to my viewing El Topo I had given Jodorowsky's other movie Holy Mountain a ten. I've changed my rating for that other movie to a two, and I rate this a movie a 1 (awful), and both actions are taken for the following reason: In El Topo Jodorowsky kills two crows or ravens. You see them die on screen. Seeing them die right there on screen was incredibly disgusting, disturbing, and outrageous.If the deaths were simulated that would have been OK. But crows and ravens are (along with parrots) the most intelligent types of birds. Their intelligence is comparable to that of great apes and five year old human children.So seeing them killed changed my view of Jodorowsky instantly. I now see him as nothing more than a shallow self serving hack.I've seen The Holy Mountain before on DVD, but yesterday evening I saw it on the big screen at The Tower in Salt Lake. Then El Topo was shown afterward. I'm sorry I saw El Topo, and I'm sorry that I previously considered Jodorowsky to have any level of credibility as a director. Those killings ruined my whole evening.I can put up with a lot and I'm not into censorship. But generally snuff films of any sort remain taboo, even in the art film community - and for good reason. El Topo was a snuff film where two lovely intelligent birds were murdered by the hack Jodorowsky. In The Holy Mountain crap is turned into gold. But El Topo shows that there's some crap which remains crap no matter what you do with it.Avoid Jodorowsky. Do not honor his work by viewing it. A person who kills intelligent animals may have their good traits, but they are in my view morally bankrupt and deserving of shunning by those more enlightened.Lastly El Topo is a jumbled uncomfortable mixed up mess.Anyway I can take Salo. I can take Caligula. I enjoyed Destricted. And I can even handle simulated snuff films where humans or intelligent animals are killed (albeit in a simulated way which isn't readily apparent) as part of a film. But no one would accept having a person killed as part of a non-documentary movie which was released. And no one should accept having highly intelligent animals like a beautiful crow or raven killed either.Maybe in the 70s such actions were more common. Maybe in the rough and tumble world of Mexico morals differ. But abuse is abuse. And any man who kills such birds should be severely fined and locked up for a time. That's my view, after spending the last 12 years of my life living in very close contact with four parrots, and as the operator of an online mailing list with hundreds of crow lovers on it worldwide.When you interact with these fellow animals first hand you recognize their value. So to see such creatures clearly & purposefully killed in a film, well, it made me conclude that Jodorowsky is not any sort of a visionary director. Instead he's merely a shallow & vain hack.",El Topo
79,Cadriel,Description is not enough...,9,15 September 2000,"El Topo is Alexandro Jodorowsky's second film (the first being Fando y Lis), and his first to rise to success as a counterculture film in the 1970s, which was then followed by The Holy Mountain.I don't know that anyone other than Jodorowsky could've made El Topo. Though the film has its critics (and the total of ratings here is low for a film that does what El Topo does), it's one you ought to see.  There are things in the movie that Jodorowsky undoubtedly meant to disturb the viewer, and the high level of violence is counterbalanced by the imagery. (Jodorowsky, as a filmmaker, is a master at crafting bizarre ideas and symbolism into filmed images.)The plot is...um...weird.  I won't tell you the plot, because it's honestly a good deal better in the execution than in the planning--this is why I think nobody but Jodorowsky can film the movies he's done.On a side note, it seems most copies of El Topo are taken from Japanese laserdiscs, meaning several things:  one, there is a loss in quality, as the minimal transfer is master film; film reel used for LDs; master cassette; tape you get.  So it's probably 3rd gen, has the standard of Japanese film where any ""naughty"" bits are given a digital blur, and two, it has subtitles in Japanese.  I could read some of them (studying Japanese will do that for you), and the sub job isn't exactly great, but it does the trick.  (I believe copies of The Holy Mountain are the same, but I have yet to pick one up for myself.)In any case, El Topo's a film for people who enjoy bizarre, violent films, and probably just as good an introduction to Jodorowsky as you can find.",El Topo

81,rich-445,An astonishing piece of work,8,17 April 2007,"I have had the great good fortune to see this movie in a local cinema, and I have to say I don't think I've ever spent so long with my mouth hanging open.Almost every reviewer has made some comparison to other works just to try and describe El Topo, and so here's my take: imagine a Western co-written by Lewis Carroll and the Monty Python team, co-directed by Terry Gilliam, Sergio Leone and Ingmar Bergman, and with design by Salvador Dali and Heironymous Bosch. Then further imagine that all of the above sat down beforehand and took very generous quantities of suspect powders and tablets, and there you have it.There is a story, inasmuch as there is a strand of activity, although even that falters at times. But there is as little to aide one as to meaning as there is in the blankest of poetry.There are plenty of awful clichés, some very rough camera work and editing, and great dollops of atrocious acting, but there are also inspired moments, amazing performances and some of the most awesome cinematic images I have ever seen.And a lot of it is very funny. Like the 'hero' being run over by a dam-burst of the physically disabled and deformed pouring from a hole in a mountain. It's like that, you see. From the very first scene of the typically black-clad gunfighter riding across the desert, when you realise that he has a completely naked small boy riding pillion, you'll find massacre victims spitted on 30-foot poles, Buddhist gunslingers who tragically believe themselves beyond defeat, women dubbed with gruff men's voices, gay sheriffs, and even a village priest whose sermons involve getting the congregation to play Russian Roulette.As to spirituality, there is lots said in review (and by the director)about the film's inherent orientalism, but I have to say, dead Buddhists aside, that there seems to be a lot more of the Bible in here than anything else, although if it IS an allegory, I'm stuck as to what it might be. You will notice on the way past, however, references to John the Baptist, Jesus, Daniel and the Lion, Samson, and loads more besides.Everyone should see this movie before they die.

83,chris_razack,Trying too hard to be cool,1,3 February 2019,"I thought this movie was ok but had no real point. I was just watching a bad guy in real life play a bad guy in the film. Like what? Lie and cheat your way to the top and when your at the end of your life, seek forgiveness and give to others?After randomly finding out that the director had said that he had actually raped his costar I could only assume that he knew what he was saying regardless of English being a possible second language of his. He seems like one of those ""I'm cool because I make art"" people. Because of this attitude, he most likely may have tried to method act it. Knowing that he wrote and was the director for the film, one could assume that he also thought he was powerful because he was ""the guy making the film"" and thus pedestrian-like people who are weak-minded look up to him and will do whatever he says and be ok with it.In the version that I saw the scene may have been cut but from everything that I've read, consensual sex happened. So a sex scene with a possible early 30's blonde woman but not a handicap woman? Kudos to you sir, you clown.This is why Stanley Kubrick is just one of the best directors that I have seen. From out of all the movies that I've seen of Stanley, he does sex scenes with class. Barry Lyndon for example, made in the 70's, done with class. This Alejandro guy doesn't know the difference between true art and amateur art but sadly he is making art nonetheless so El tops is an ok film.I just can't give it a 5 star because of the whole rape thing. Like, rape is a serious thing and to possibly joke about it or not actually mean what you are saying is childish.I thought holy mountain was good but now I think it's ok as well. I just see his movies differently now on top of knowing that he directs and writes his own movies while possibly staring in them. I'll just never give a 10 to a film of a known rapist. He could be a likeable guy but a rapist is a rapist.Regardless of everything above, I thought the ending was trash.

84,BuffaloWilder,Well...,8,6 February 2008,"""El Topo"" is a film that's something of an acquired taste, I'm sure. It's a very allegorical film, and some would call it outright bizarre, and they'd be correct. But, that isn't a bad thing.Essentially, the film is a skewed Western, starting with the line: ""You are seven years old. You are a man now. Bury your first toy and a picture of your mother,"" and ending with the son taking his father's place (after his father has immolated himself), riding off into the sunset, so to speak, with his own little boy. The main character, the titular El Topo, through the course of the film, undergoes a metamorphosis from a weary, sometimes disturbingly so, gunfighter to something of a Buddhist Jesus figure, and in one of the more disturbing shots, we pick up on him, years later, in a meditative state, hair on end and wearing lipstick and rouge. To say this film isn't for the casual film-viewer sounds very pretentious, but it's the truth. It's sometimes befuddling, sometimes extremely psychedelic, very allegorical, and undoubtedly disturbing. But, for all that, it's worth watching.John Lennon cited it as one of his favorite films, so that should maybe be enough for some. Myself, I just like Jodorowsky's stuff. I'd also recommend ""Santa Sangre,"" or ""El Montana Sagrada.""",El Topo
85,Arcana13,One of the five strangest films is also strikingly beautiful,10,8 February 2000,"Jodorowsky is a master of the grotesque (original meaning of the term). El Topo, his most famous work, is easily watchable due to its striking cinematography and beautiful, if stark, locations.  It may take a couple of viewings to totally grasp the allegories and the odd visual tropes employed by Jodorowsky, but it's worth it.  Please note: on video there are at least two versions available, one of which is about twenty minutes longer.  Make sure you get the original, longer work.",El Topo
86,spiderangelwing,A Masterpiece,9,20 February 2003,"While browsing through the shelves of the rubbish local DVD rental shop, I was rather surprised to come across this on DVD. I'd heard about this film and how rare it was supposed to be - I didn't even know it was available on DVD. It went back home with me, and I watched it last night.Bloody hell, it's good. It's one of the few movies which truly deserve the adjective ""dreamlike"" - thanks to Jodorowsky's direction and the stark cinematography, almost every scene is an unforgettable image. Perhaps the closest parallel I can draw to this is Kubrick's 2001, the only other film I can think of in which every scene is striking even if taken out of the context of the film. From the opening scene: the black leather-clad cowboy on the black horse in the harsh whiteness of the desert, to the end, we are presented with a sequence of images that are burned directly into memory: the village where a massacre has taken place, with the muddy streets awash with pools of blood reflecting the clear sky. El Topo handing his gun over to his seven-year-old son, instructing him to put the sole survivor out of his misery. I could go on, and on, and on.This is a movie that demands to be seen twice, three times and more. I've only managed a single viewing and it had to go back to the rental shop, and I can't honestly claim to have understood everything in the film at first viewing. It's a richly allegorical film, every scene is suffused with meaning that is only uncovered after the credits roll, when you're thinking about in bed before you fall asleep. It would be safe to say that this film will be a different experience for everyone who sees it - most will come away from this film with their own interpretation. Contrary to what I had been led to believe, it's even possible to simply enjoy it as an action-adventure Western, though that would be a gross missing of the point.Well, in short, I love it.",El Topo
87,mobia,Highly layered symbolic vision,10,20 August 2004,"Initially set up as a western movie in the manner of Sergio Leone, the film soon slips out into surprising metaphysical realms. A gunslinging avenger (El Topo; played by the director himself) defeats a local militant tyrant, castrating him and stealing his female lover away into the open desert, leaving his naked son in the care of monks. Goaded on by the woman who becomes increasingly demanding, El Topo (who calls himself ""God"") faces down several holy men, cheating to win. Not satisfied, the woman finds a sadistic female lover, and turns on El Topo, shooting him several times. El Topo is reborn as a genorous selfless man in a cave full of mutants whom he helps to escape from their enclosed incestuous existence. Reuniting with his now grown son and working with a dwarf woman in the local town to earn money, El Topo finally frees the mutants but on their road to freedom they are massacred. El Topo takes out his revenge on the townsfolk and burns himself alive, leaving his son, the dwarf and an infant behind who ride off into the desert to whatever destiny awaits them. This film is so saturated with meanings, it can be talked about for days if not years. It has haunted me as few films have.

I commented at the time on how the visuals were perceived within the framework of drug culture stating that while stoned on pot and well under the influence, 'El Topo' becomes a violent, would-be erotic freak show, and that, I suppose can be very heavy for some viewers. For others, it is enough to make one yawn. So, take your drugs, let your jaw drop, and try to enjoy this watered down knock off of many better films. It certainly didn't work for me.Yes, it has some unusual imagery, designed to fascinate the clueless and titillate the TV hypnotized hordes, but in total, it is no more meaningful than an 'in depth' article in USA Today.

90,Cloudmeister,It's all about the imagery,7,17 April 2007,"Regarded as a masterpiece by some, including Dennis Hopper, the late John Lennon and George Harrison, this is the very definition of a cult film. A violent, surrealist, allegorical underground sensation upon its release 37 years ago, the film has been out of print since - existing only in poor quality bootleg videos. Now the film is finally being released on DVD and is currently on an exclusive cinema run around the UK.To me, it's not very easy to love surrealism. It's easy to respect it and even easier to hate it all. But one things for sure, it certainly makes quite an impact. Many images from this surrealist Mexican pseudo-biblical western will stay with me for a long time, no matter how ridiculous I thought it was at first. The images contained in this film include a man being buried in dead rabbits, a man with no legs being carried on the back of a man with no arms, several dozen black and Mexican men being branded with hot irons and sold as slaves, a group of deformed and disabled people being mercilessly gunned down by a group of morally-twisted cross-dressing townsfolk, a man catching a bullet in a butterfly net and throwing it back at his opponent, and a nail-bitingly tense game of Russian roulette in a church. As with all surrealism, for every image to laugh at and ridicule, there is one to be utterly floored by due to it's undeniable power.The imagery and symbolism permeate every scene of this film, sometimes bluntly and sometimes more subtly. Elements of Judeo-Christianity include the four duellists representing the four prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel) and El Topo himself as Jesus Christ, whilst the latter half of the film can be seen to show the reincarnation beliefs of Tibetan Buddhism.As the round of applause from the audience at the end of the film tonight showed, this is a profoundly powerful and daring film but it is definitely not for everyone. It is somewhat dated and perhaps a little flawed. But as El Topo himself says, ""Too much perfection is a mistake.""",El Topo
91,adrianawebuhm,Majestic true cult movie,9,4 November 2017,"I wasn't immediately convinced with this film, El Topo. The initial scenarios seemed too strange in an ugly sort of way... to put it simply. However it gradually became clear that this was the intended style of the beginning of the film and I decided to see the film for what it is, instead of what it wasn't. Then it continued to change. I was engaged by the Western element of the film. Jodorowsky himself played quite a stylish lead actor, and while the film was weird, it began to get weirder... in a good way. It had a unique taste. This wasn't your average Spaghetti Western wannabe. This was a truly unique film. Some of the images and montages that transpired were awe-inspiring and it started to become clearer that this was a real art work and not just an ordinary film. As the film went on it reached a metaphysical level, really mythical too. As with films like Embrace of the Serpent from South America, you feel that Jodorowsky is both critical of the bizarre Christian symbolism he mixes with the native peoples of those parts. He creates a unique fusion that I must admit, I don't know very much of how this all fits into the history and culture in Chile or South America... nevertheless I found El Topo to be quite a fascinating piece!",El Topo
92,Yank-2,Masterpiece? I don't know. Bizarre? YES!,5,12 February 2007,"For years I had been wanting to watch this hard-to-find movie. I finally watched it and I am glad I watched it, but I will never watch it again.I can't say that I know tons about film. I have watched obscurities from ""Les Vampires"" to ""The Brown Bunny"". I do my best to embrace all forms of cinema. I try to accept certain films for what they are. I found it really hard to do that with ""El Topo"".The film is not shocking and feels extremely outdated. The symbolism is wildly overdone in a very amateurish fashion. It lacks any real character development or plot. But it's like watching a train wreck: you just can't stop yourself from looking.With a 3-D movie you were required to wear 3-D glasses, with ""El Topo"" you are required to be tripping on LSD.""El Topo"" just makes no sense at all.

95,critcguy,A major disappointment...,1,20 July 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I was perusing the Foreign section of the local video store of rare and hard to find films when I saw ""El Topo"" sitting plainly on the shelf.  My heart rose, as I had heard much about the film and wanted to see it very much -- plus it is so hard to find and JESUS CHRIST it was sitting right there!I took it home and watched it right away.  I was extremely disappointed. Folks, there is a reason why this movie is so hard to find, let me tell you...(SPOILERS)The first half of this movie has the main character El Topo with his young son riding through the desert where they encounter various violent wierdnesses.  The first is a barn in the middle of nowhere with mutilated human and cattle all over the place.  Only one man is left - he is lying on the ground, wounded, and begging for El Topo to put him out of his misery. El Topo gives his gun to the seven-year-old boy, who kills the man.  Nice, right?  This is just one of the many pointless situations they get themselves into.  After this, they arrive somewhere else, and then somewhere else, again and again, just for more unexplained violence, without any other plot, explanation, or transition between these episodes.The second half begins after El Topo is shot dead.  We are taken to yet another remote village in the desert (again, without any explanation or reason whatsoever).  A few scenes stand out in my head:1.) A man is slaving over a group of women in some sort of salon.  They all seem to be hitting on him, wanting him to fool around with them. Eventually, one of the women drops something, and when he bends over to pick it up for her, she pulls him to her inner thigh and then starts screaming out that he is advancing on her without her consent.  The other women rush over and start hitting him, then sexually abusing HIM, all the while shouting at him to stop raping them.  He is dragged outside by the town's men where he is hung and shot.2.) In some sort of room, a bunch of townspeople are passing around a gun loaded with one blank bullit (which they pretend is real) and pretend to play Russian roulette.  Everyone misses the blank bullit, and shouting out that they are holy for being so lucky.  The son of El Topo (who has found his way to this village and now grown into a man) takes the gun, removes the blank and replaces it with a real bullit.  He then does a round of roulette on himself and survives.  The people love it.  They pass around the gun, pulling the trigger on themselves, surviving.  Each time, they shout out praises to God and what not.  In all the excitement, a young child grabs the gun and shoots himself in the head and dies.If these scenes are supposed to mean something, I sure as hell missed the point.(END OF SPOILERS)It's not that I don't like Jodorowsky's work, or am weak-stomached.  I adore SANTA SANGRE and would recommend it to anyone.  It's just that the film seems to exploit unpleasantness as if it were a valuable asset in a film. It does so without entertainment, shock-value, or any other form of success and just comes off as a waste of the little time and money it might have cost to make it.  It is offensive for that reason - offensively bad.Anyone who is on this website must appreciate good films.  I know I do. There is so much else to apply your mind to, ladies and gentlemen.  Go out and rent something worth your while.  Don't rent this crap just because it's rare and ""notorious"".  That's why I rented it, but that's not why I didn't like it.  Even for those who pursue hard-to-find videos, like me: beware. This is pretty lousy film-making.",El Topo

99,tifrap,"A truly great epic, in the tradition of Dante or Taliesin. Timeless film making.",9,9 July 2007,"The tag-line for this film does it no credit at all, but that is because the person who wrote it obviously did so for a Hollywood audience - ""See the priest ride into the sunset with a midget and her newborn baby"" or is that a wild west freak show audience? The film and its narrative is rooted in an ancient storytelling tradition that is earthy, real and appeals to an innate human sense of symbolism and drama. Watching such a tale unfold can give you a real sense of relief that despite the often over sophisticated diet of todays media, we can still follow a tale in a way that calls on a different part of the brain, the same part that has handed down wisdom between cultures and generations over millennia. It is visual storytelling that almost needs no dialogue. While watching it I was continually struck by the similarities with Sergei Parajanov's films 'Shadows of Our Forgotten Ancestors'1964, 'Sayat Nova (Colour of Pomegranates)' made two years before this film and 'The Legend of the Suram Fortress'1984 - if you like these films you will also like this one and vice versa - If anything this film is a bit more conventional, in a north American cultural sense than Paradjanov's deeply mysterious Georgian cultural symbolism, and a good deal more visceral (theatrical blood excepted). I would suggest that to class this film as a western, may satisfy the genre purists in as much as that its costumes and locations conform, but seriously misses the underlying moral, almost biblical tale - complete with sheep, goats rabbits and owls, but no cows or cowboys. This is more of a mystery play out of the central Russian steppe. Having said that, it is impossible to miss the mildly Zapatista political critique of what presumably represents 'gringo' culture; some of which are very insightful indeed, particularly the 'colonel's' men begging for the glimpse of a woman's breasts, and even more delightful, the use of the 'eye in the pyramid' logo to represent the Yankee dollar and those who have sold themselves to it. Take two hours out, watch this film and just let it soak in, better than any feel-good experience that Tinseltown has to offer.",El Topo
100,ilikemisato,The first movie that I felt ashamed of myself for watching...,3,25 August 2007,"Watching this film because of John Lennon's endorsement and a short synopsis I had read, I found myself very upset about what I saw and disappointed with the story as a whole (particularly the second half = the acting and plot went downhill very quickly). While the visuals, for the most part, are amazing and hauntingly desolate/strange...the film quickly became an unsettling, pretentious mess. First, the entire film is a biblical allusion (Old and New Testament), which would be great...BUT Jodorowsky's religious references are so blatant and redundant that they become annoying, tired and expected (like moral ground in a Disney cartoon geared toward a six year old). Secondly, there are hundreds of dead mutilated, mostly real animals throughout the entire film making it one to watch on an empty stomach (I actually do biomedical research using rats, which I have to dissect biweekly for brain and spinal tissue, and the animal carnage still gave me a foul taste in my mouth). Thirdly, the physics don't make any sense at all (a certain thrown knife that impossibly kills a baddie...as well as other incidences that make you say ""what...but how???"". Finally, what makes me most ashamed for watching this film, is the gratuitous, undignified and disrespectfully dark humor use of actual maimed and deformed (by birth defects) people throughout the entire film. A perfect example of this is a part where a man with no arms reaches for a gun in his holster.So before you buy...I strongly recommended renting it. And if you really want a slick, surrealist gunfight film, try Branded To Kill by Seijun Suzuki (so strangely wonderful, he was fired for making it).",El Topo

Although the pacing speaks to a past time of longer attention spans, in the end I can only shake my head with respect and awe for the genius of it all.

108,lgelain,A Cult Movie,9,8 January 2004,"What could i say about ""El Topo"" all the comments seems to point something true about it. some people wrote that el topo is a wierd movie, great movie, bad movie, religious movie, bloody, etc. but is in fact a cult movie. What is a cult movie?in my point of view is a movie that makes an impression in you for so many years that you want to watch it over and over again and is hard to find, it turns into a legend.I watched El Topo in its original version in spanish a couple nights ago, i own a VHS taken from what it looks to be a DVD because before the movie begins there´s a screen menu with some options; anyway, let me explain you some things about the spanish spoken version that makes it unique. there are some women in the movie with men voices i don´t know if in the english version is the same but it gives some sort of sick ages also there are some men like the master no. 1 that speaks like a woman and also some people in the town like the sheriff. In the church when they are praising the fake lord the chant is pretty bizarre it goes like this ""tu nos proteges señor"" over and over again with the leading voice of the sheriff lover (it looks like)a lady voice. When el topo leaves the son with the monks one of them says in a very gay voice ""llora niño que se apiade de ti"".I wonder how it feels like to watch it in a big screen. is a great movie as many people may say,watch it and enjoy it, you won´t be disappointed, but if you are expecting great sound and expensive special effects then you will be disappointed. El topo legend will continue when Jodorowsky finds money to film it ""the sons of el topo"" is called.El topo is an interesting example of how to make good movies with low budget especially in countries where the cinema industry is so bad like in Mexico product of the lack of interest in it. Let me give you some mexican titles that are great old movies and you can enjoy them as el topo. ""Satanico Pandemonium"", ""el libro de piedra"", ""Hasta el viento tiene miedo"", ""veneno para las Hadas"", ""viva la muerte""(spain), ""Rojo amanecer"", ""Pedro Paramo"", ""La vida inutil de pito perez"", ""el familiar"", ""la muerte deun burocrata"" (cuba),""la virgen de los sicarios"", ""satanasde mis amores"", buñuel movies, etc. I hope you can find them all and watch them in a dark room at midnight, pure culture and art vitamins.

Not only had it received excellent critical reviews, but I also found various postings on the Internet praising the film as a masterpiece. Well, I'm here to say that this is a vastly overrated student art film.The symbolism is overdone and sophomoric at best. In fact, it is as if the director thought symbolism could be substituted for plot and character development, forgetting that these are tools used to enhance them. Also, the overly hackneyed and simplistic symbolism takes away from the surreal experience that the director intended to create. It was akin to viewing the subconscious of a mental midget: weird but boring as all hell!! I'm not even going to dwindle on the violence. It goes without saying that over time it has lost its shock value. However, it was not necessarily gratuitous--although the symbolism was--and did add to the story.Overall, if you like freaky stuff for the sake of freakishness, this film is up your alley. But, if you want more substance and meaningful development avoid El Topo at all possible cost. I know I want those two hours of my life back!",El Topo
