0,MartinHafer,A profoundly sad story because he isn't sad.,9,7 August 2021,"As the film begins, Davis (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his wife are in the car and she's driving. Their conversation seems mundane...when suddenly there's an accident and she's killed.How Davis responds to her death is really strange...though not completely hard to believe. Instead of focusing on his feelings, Davis is mechanical in how he looks at things....analyzing and thinking with zero emotion. A few of his quirks include taking apart machines around the home and office...just to see how they work as well as sending a string of long meandering letters to a vending machine company...because he lost $1.50 in one of their machines! He obviously is compartmentalizing....in other words, locking away his feelings and closing the door on them in his mind. This does not mean he doesn't think about his wife...but when he does, it's in a very disconnected and strangely analytical fashion.During the course of this strange nervous breakdown, his letters have an impact on the customer service rep who has been receiving them. Out of the blue, she calls him and they form a friendship....a very tentative and strange friendship. And, you start to realize that both of them are damaged souls...as is her very odd son. What's next? See the film.Like so much of Jake Gyllenhaal's work, this film is incredibly strange and hard to predict. This actually is why I sought out this film.... I love how this actor takes risks and plays the most unusual actors. If you don't believe this, consider SOURCE CODE, NIGHTCRAWLER and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. These are NOT typical Hollywood releases and almost defy description...which I appreciate. After all, with over 26,000 reviews to my credit, there does often seem to be a sameness to a lot of films.Apart from being different, is it worth seeing? And, is it any good? Yes, though I don't see the film as the type everyone would like, that's for sure. In many ways, the movie actually reminds me of Adam Sandler's REIGN OVER ME, a highly neglected film about a man who lost his family and simply refuses to come to terms with it. Both movies really make you think...both are also a bit unpleasant to watch but well worth seeing.I think this is a brave movie...one worth watching. However, it doesn't have a nice, clean, happy ending....and I could understand folks not enjoying the movie as a result.",Demolition
1,SnoopyStyle,loss,6,1 September 2017,"Davis (Jake Gyllenhaal) works in Phil (Chris Cooper)'s small, rich investment firm. Despite Phil's objections, Davis marries his daughter Julia. Davis and Julia get into a car crash and Julia is killed. Davis is emotionally stunned and lost. He becomes obsessed with disassembling starting with his fridge. His complaint letters get the attention of customer service rep Karen (Naomi Watts) who has her own dysfunctions.This small movie about loss and dysfunction has some good potential. It definitely has some great actors. I want to push harder and put the characters in more danger. For example, the boy struggles with his sexuality but he could have had some great interactions with his schoolmates. There is drama left on the table. Davis and Karen have an interesting start but their relationship needs to be pushed. Karen's husband could have done more than follow him in the station-wagon. Its quiet losses leave the movie less than what it could have been.",Demolition
2,Prismark10,Breaking down,2,3 March 2017,"Jake Gyllenhaal plays Davis, an investment banker in his father in law's firm. After his wife dies in a car accident he struggles with the grieving process but finds some kind of catharsis though a customer service representative of a vending machine company and her son as well as by literally demolishing his life both physically and mentally.Davis's wife Julia was rich, her parent's wealthy. He had sex with his wife three hours after he met her in a party. The marriage was beneficial for him and Davis realises he never truly loved her but should had done more to make the marriage work.Davis's behaviour especially his newly found fondness to dismantle everything alienates him from his father in law and his co-workers at the firm. He also seems to be stalked by someone in a station wagon and the owner of the vending machine company is not pleased with him as the customer service rep is his girlfriend.The film wastes the supporting actors like Naomi Watts and Chris Cooper. The screenplay is a mess, it is not about a man grieving but a man feeling guilty that he did not love his wife. Davis is a selfish prick and a dumb one as he could not figure out why that station wagon kept following him.",Demolition
3,claudio_carvalho,Overrated Mess,3,20 June 2017,"The investment broker Davis Mitchell (Jake Gyllenhaal) is married with Julia (Heather Lind) and works at his father-in-law's firm in New York City. One day, Julia is driving her car with Davis and another car crashes and kills Julia. In the hospital, Davis purchases a chocolate bar in a vendor machine but the candy is stuck in the machine. Davis writes a strange letter to the owner of the piece of equipment reporting the malfunction and the costumer service representative Karen Moreno (Naomi Watts) contacts him. Meanwhile he becomes unstable and obsessed with a weird behavior at work and his father-in-law Phil Eastwood (Chris Cooper) asks him to take some days off. Davis befriends the pothead Karen and her gay teenage son Chris (Judah Lewis) while he tries to erase his former life and build a new one.""Demolition"" is an overrated film with a messy story and great cast. The attitude of Davis Mitchell grieving the loss of his wife is awkward. His friendship with Karen is terrible and quite inexplicable even for a seriously disturbed man. His decision to literally demolish his loveless married life destroying everything is ridiculous. But the worst is when he learns that he was a cuckold and begins to honor Julia. Summarizing, an awful story. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Demolição"" (""Demolition"")",Demolition
4,edwagreen,**,4,22 January 2017,"If someone calls building a relationship through letters to a customer service representative representing a candy machine that didn't work realistic, I'll tip my hat to you.Jake Gyllenhaal does give an interesting performance as the young man who loses his wife in a tragic accident while he walked away injury-free. Chris Cooper steals the acting here as her distraught father. The Gyllenhaal character works for Cooper in his successful business.The picture essentially deals with grieving, but the way Gyllenhaal goes about it by pulling an emergency chord in a train and smashing up his home and office equipment is a little too far fetched.Naomi Watts plays the customer representative with plenty of problems of her own. Who would call someone at 2:00A.M. from the customer service department at any store? Ridiculous.",Demolition

Say that your 15-year-old son is getting picked on in school because he paints his fingernails black, while blowing up and torching toy soldiers and army trucks on his Current Events classroom floor to illustrate a Sunni Iraqi Humvee Bar-B-Q? Step One in dealing with this two-week suspension is to yank a troubled acquaintance over to your place for sleepovers while your regular lover\boss is out of town.

But what if going all Columbine on his Fellow Man doesn't ease Junior's angst? If your bedroom bud has an ounce of Understanding, he'll take the lad on a shopping spree for sledge hammers and Sawz Alls at Home Depot, so that the two of them can prep his mansion for remodeling. Should a Third Step be required, why not suggest that the boys rent a bulldozer to give that old Palace an Extreme Makeover? Who's got that kind of dough, you might ask.

7,george.schmidt,Gyllenhaal excels in another off-beat role with remarkable skill,8,26 April 2016,"DEMOLITION (2016) *** Jake Gyllenhaal, Naomi Watts, Chris Cooper, Judah Lewis, CJ Wilson, Polly Draper, Heather Lind. Gyllenhaal continues his streak of portraying angst filled young men who cannot express their inner emotions as an investment financier who's life is abruptly disrupted in the accidental death of his wife with the repercussions of grief being in limbo as he attempts to process any feeling outside of being numb. Forming an unlikely relationship with a vending machine customer rep (Watts) who more or less stalks him after his letters of correspondence unveiling his thought process. Filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallee has the unenviable job of making a somewhat unlikable protagonist a flesh and blood human being no thanks to Bryan Sipe's more-or-less underscored script (the terms of metaphor are literally said aloud!) which is so awkwardly unsubtle. Cooper's low-key, simmering with rage father-in-law serves better as the voice of reason while newcomer Lewis as Watts' tween son wrestling with androgyny and rebellion keeps things lively. The film's darkness could have been even darker but the ways Gyllenhaal's character deals (or doesn't deal) with his new leas on life (and its consequences) are remarkable.",Demolition
8,phd_travel,Interesting in parts but not a good whole,4,29 June 2017,Strange movie that could have been better. A man who loses his wife to a car accident reacts in unexpected ways. So it starts of like a quirky indie grief dramedy. He also meets a customer service rep played by Naomi Watts and they form a bond. When he starts interacting with the young son of Naomi Watts there are some funny one liners. It is quite horrific to see him demolish his beautiful home.The twist is a bit of a shock. Is the message that no point being so broken up about someone since she didn't really love him that much anyway? If so maybe there is a useful lesson.The ending could have been saved by a happier ending of some sort like the start of a real relationship with Naomi Watt's character.,Demolition
9,gradyharp,'Customer service is a profession?',8,8 January 2017,"Bryan Sipe provided the screenplay for this strange film directed by Jean-Marc Vallée ('Wild', 'The Young Victoria', 'Dallas Buyers Club', 'C.R.A.Z.Y' etc) – a film that while watching it becomes tedious but when it s over, in retrospect, it packs a punch, and maybe that is the 'demolition' suggested in the title. Or better yet, the subtitle of the film says it all – 'LIFE: Some Disassembly Required.'Davis (Jake Gyllenhaal), a successful investment banker, struggles after losing his wife Julia (Heather Lind) in a tragic car crash. Despite pressure from his father-in-law, Phil (Chris Cooper), to pull it together, Davis continues to unravel. What starts as a complaint letter to a vending machine company turns into a series of letters revealing startling personal admissions. Davis' letters catch the attention of customer service rep, Karen (Naomi Watts), and, amidst emotional and financial burdens of her own (like her boyfriend Carl – C.J. Wilson), the two form an unlikely connection. With the help of Karen and her son Chris (Judah Lewis, a dynamic young actor), Davis starts to rebuild, beginning with the demolition of the life he once knew.Get past the mass destruction of homes, appliances, and all manner of other items Davis destroys and the story (well worth telling) creeps up on the viewer – the many ways we face and cope with grief in the death of a lot one, the intricacies between a father-in-law and a son-in-law, dealing with questions of sexual identity with teenagers, etc and the movie becomes more than it first appears. Jake Gyllenhaal proves once again that he can tackle just about any role he assumes.",Demolition
10,deloudelouvain,Great acting with a good story.,8,22 January 2017,"Since Donnie Darko I'm a big fan of Jake Gyllenhaal. I think he's a great actor. In Donnie Darko he played a weirdo and you could say that in Demolition he's playing a weirdo again. Totally different though but a bit weird in his own way. A guy without much emotions, and who tells the truth how he sees it even if it hurts people that don't understand his vision of life. It's all very black and white with him and that what's make this movie interesting to watch. When he encounters Naomi Watts he seems to have found a likewise person. They're both strange and the story that is been told is pleasant to watch with some funny moments as well. Not like a comedy but still funny though. Judah Lewis as the young Chris, that is clearly struggling as well in his life plays also very well. It's a movie full of emotions with people with not much emotions. It's strange but it works. It's a bit better then a normal good movie so I will watch it again in the future.",Demolition
11,namashi_1,"Compelling, Crazy, Affecting!",9,23 June 2016,"Jean-Marc Vallée's 'Demolition' isn't an easy film to watch & nor does it want to be seen that way. This Dramatic-Dark-Comedy focuses on a unsettled man & his unusual behavior, after a tragic incident occurs in his life. But 'Demolition' isn't a film that you can shun away. This is a Stunning Film about grief & the consequence of death. 'Demolition' Synopsis: A successful investment banker (Jake Gyllenhaal) struggles after losing his wife in a tragic car crash. With the help of a customer service rep (Naomi Watts) and her young son (Judah Lewis), he starts to rebuild, beginning with the demolition of the life he once knew.'Demolition' will not appeal to all. And I strongly believe Director Jean-Marc Vallée is aware of this fact. Watching Davis, the protagonist, deal with grief in a rather unusual way, may be misinterpreted as crazy, obscene, but its not that. 'Demolition' examines Davis's grief, with a feeling of mental destruction & how you must break all that you have, to only build again. Its very metaphorical, very deep & hugely affecting. I was engrossed by Davis & how he slowly creates a new self.Bryan Sipe's Screenplay is Brilliant. 'Demolition' isn't an easy film to write & choosing such a different treatment, requires a strong amount of commitment & belief. Sipe's Writing is compelling. Jean- Marc Vallée's Direction is superb. He has handled the film, with command. Yves Bélanger's Cinematography is visually rich, while Jay M. Glen's Editing is sharp. Art & Costume Design are top-notch. Performance-Wise: Jake Gyllenhaal as Davis, delivers a transformative performance. Undoubtedly one of the finest actors to have ever graced the big-screen, Jake is absolutely terrific here, enacting the unsettled protagonist with enviable energy. Its a yet another winning performance from an actor who doesn't forget to surprise us. Naomi Watts is restrained, while Judah Lewis is confidence personified. The scenes between Jake & Judah, are great. Chris Cooper is masterful, yet again! As the heartbroken father, who later dismisses Davis for his unusual behavior, Cooper is a presence to reckon with. Heather Lind leaves a mark. On the whole, 'Demolition' is a must watch, for those, who are willing to look at a story on grief, with a difference. Strongly Recommended!",Demolition

13,Hellmant,I can really relate to his madness!,9,29 April 2016,"'DEMOLITION': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)  Comedy-drama flick starring Jake Gyllenhaal, as a banker that struggles  through a severe mental breakdown; after losing his wife in a car  accident. The film was directed by Jean-Marc Vallee (who also helmed  the critically acclaimed hits 'DALLAS BUYER'S CLUB' and 'WILD'), and it  was written by Bryan Sipe. The movie costars Naomi Watts and Chris  Cooper; marking Gyllenhaal and Cooper's third film collaboration  together (following 'OCTOBER SKY' and 'JARHEAD'). It's received only  mixed-reviews from critics, but I loved it.  Gyllenhaal plays Davis Mitchell; an investment banker, who loses his  wife in a horrible car accident (that he walks away from, unharmed). He  tries to go back to a normal life, but begins suffering from extreme  mental illness; much to the disappointment of his father-in-law  (Cooper). Davis sends several complaint letters to a vending machine  company, after a machine malfunctions; and it fails to give him the  candy bar he purchased. One customer service employee, Karen Moreno  (Watts), is moved by his letters (which reveal a lot of intimate  personal information about him), and the two begin a friendly  relationship.  The movie is both really funny, and quite depressing (at times).  Gyllenhaal is fantastic in the lead, and I found his character  fascinating and very likable as well. I've never experienced the death  of a spouse, but I can still really relate to his madness. The film is  touching too, but I think it's focus on mental illness (and it's superb  portrayal of it) are really what make the movie so memorable.",Demolition

15,MOscarbradley,Unbelievably bad.,1,26 February 2017,"Unbelievably bad. Jean-Marc Vallee's ""Demolition"" is about grief; set it beside ""Manchester By the Sea"", which deals with the same subject, and this would be a 1 whereas ""Manchester..."" would be a 100. It's a kind of icky romance about a man coming to terms with his wife's death in a car crash. He's played by Jake Gyllenhaal with a pained expression on his face that says, ""How did I end up in something like this"". Naomi Watts, looking baffled, is the woman who helps him cope. Chris Cooper, in a small part as the dead wife's father, almost makes this bearable but the appalling script defeats him. Did anyone actually think this was worth making? If this is the in-flight 'entertainment' on a Trans-Atlantic crossing you might find yourself hoping the plane takes a nose-dive.",Demolition
16,ThomasDrufke,Recovery,6,8 December 2016,"It's not the typically structured or impeccably written piece that Gyllenhaal usually takes on. Heck, what would you expect with a title of 'Demolition'. But peeling back the layers of this character and film make for an interesting watch, to say the least.Jean-Marc Vallée directs this as his follow-up to Wild and Dallas Buyers Club, and it's yet another interesting character study in his filmography. Vallée does a nice job of getting the most out of Jake Gyllenhaal, because I'm not sure this movie works without his performance. In fact, seeing the recent 'Nocturnal Animals' makes Gyllenhaal's performance here even more impressive. Both characters deal with grief and loss in a completely different way and watching him create an entirely separate persona for each, and still have it seem real, shows his immense talent.Along with Gyllenhaal (Davis), the film stars Naomi Watts, Judah Lewis, and Chris Cooper. All of them contribute to the arc of grief to recovery for Davis throughout the movie. At its core, the film is about breaking down Davis' consciousness, or lack thereof, and his attempt to rekindle emotion in any sort of way. The film is downright strange, and probably unlike anything I have ever seen, but I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. There's something about the passionless and quirky nature of Davis that was fascinating. Especially, when he's up against Watts, who plays a similarly peculiar character.Ultimately, the story is only going to end one way. So as much as the film's portrayal of grief and sorrow is unique, we know where it will eventually end up. It's not a film that was especially entertaining, or emotionally powerful, but I definitely found it to be unique. So props to Vallée and others involved for at least making a different film.+Gyllenhaal & Watts+Peeling back his emotions was portrayed uniquely-Not necessarily the most entertaining or profound story, however6.7/10",Demolition

20,Reno-Rangan,When we won't feel a thing for a great loss...,7,24 July 2016,"I am observing closely Jake Gyllenhaal's acting career and he's giving the best performances in all his films. He's one of top 5 best actor of our generation. So technically I love all his films, especially in the recent years and tell me who won't if they love good stories and performance. I expected this to be another excellent film and yes it was, but not that great.What he has given to his fans and film viewers is the promise and fulfilled it all the way. So even an average film can automatically become a better one. This film was based on the one of the blacklisted script, but Gyllenhaal's presence made all the difference along with the wonderful director.It was the story of a man who lost his wife in a car accident. His way of grieving is what the film narrates. He realises that he's not able feel a thing when everyone around does, so he decides to make search for the answers and so the bizarre journey begins. The casting was good, but it was all about the Gyllenhaal's role. I like Naomi Watts, but for the first time she looked old to me. And the others did not have much screenspace, except that new face boy who was decent.I think not everyone would enjoy it, it is a weird story of almost a weird person, so you would easily get it. You must need to be a patience, besides it is a dark comedy. You might wonder why the title was named 'Demolition', the films gives a strange demonstration for that in a good way. It is not like a must see, but totally worth for Gyllenhaal alone. I can't say it should have been better, because there's nothing to get better, everything was at its best.7/10",Demolition
21,Floated2,Things come together with patience,7,20 January 2018,"Demolition seems to be a rare type of film in which we are not used to seeing in Hollywood these days. The film has a more real atmosphereand feel to it where the characters aren't necessarily good people, but we do connect and root for the leads. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a very sounded performance as he carries the film together. Described as a strange film, this film isn't predictable which is a good thing, as we do not know what to expect as each scene comes together. The film shifts tones on almost a scene to scene basis, and it's easy to overlook how quickly a director can lose track of these tonal shifts. But director Jean-Marc Vallée never puts a foot out of line. There isn't a single shot that feels out of place.Vallée's other gift is the David O Russell-like ability to extract great performances out of his cast, as this film like somewhat of a O'Russell film. Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the most consistently brilliant American star working right now. The fact that he has only been nominated for an Oscar once is something, but perhaps his best has yet to come. As a rewatch 09/19/21' Demolition remains an overlooked film which is quite unusual compared to many others in recent memory.",Demolition
22,eddie_baggins,Gyllenhaal can't save this turkey from the scrapheap,2,18 December 2016,"After an incredible collection of films since 2012 that include the likes of End of Watch, Prisoners, Enemy, Nightcrawler and the not as amazing Everest and Southpaw (that still feature fantastic individual performances), Jake Gyllenhaal has demolished his golden run with Dallas Buyers Club and Wild director Jean-Marc Vallée's unbelievable and misguided Demolition.A film so overwrought, pretentious and just downright unlikeable, Demolition sees the two capable Hollywood players combine to create an utterly frustrating tale of love, life and regret that becomes all the more intolerable thanks to its odd sprinkling of gold that makes it quite clear this odd story of Gyllenhaal's troubled Davis, going off the rails after the untimely death of his wife that he never truly loved and entering into a weird world of vending machine complaints and house demolishing, could've been something oddly unique and touching, yet comes off here as a cold and over-confident experience that's terribly hard to like.It's through no fault of Gyllenhaal it must be said, who gives his stand-offish Davis his all but surrounded by a rather simple story that's brought out in an over-complicated fashion by Vallée (who has perhaps gotten to assured of himself after the memorable Dallas Buyers Club and the forgettable Wild) who fails to connect us the audience to this strange world made all the harder to bare once Naomi Watt's Karen and her troublemaking son Chris come onto the scene.Once Karen and Chris become a part of Davis's crumbling lifestyle, Demolition veers way too far from believability as Karen welcome's Davis into her equally odd lifestyle and Davis becomes some strange father figure to Chris that includes such events as securing his help to bash down his expensive home or an extremely misguided scene where Davis gets Chris to shoot him out in the woods. You get a feeling for what Vallée is aiming for; it just doesn't make the experience anymore engaging or satisfactory, despite the efforts of an experienced cast.There's little mystery as to why Demolition failed miserably to find an audience as it's hard to understand what the audience were expected to get out of this seen before tale that's been told before and told in a lot better fashion. A pretty looking failure that could've been something, Demolition is one for the wrecking yard.1 DIY fridge repair job out of 5",Demolition
23,paul-allaer,"""I feel nothing and you're an idiot!""",6,13 April 2016,"""Demolition"" brings the story of Davis Mitchell (played by Jake Gyllenhaal). As the movie opens, we see Davis, a successful investment banker, chatting in the car with his wife Julie, when out of nowhere the car is hit sideways. Julia dies in the accident, while Davis doesn't have as much as a scratch. At the hospital, Davis tries to buy peanut M&Ms from a vending machine, which eats his money. Davis tries to write to the vendor's customer department. Meanwhile, it's clear that mentally, Davis can't seem to process it all, and he starts withdrawing. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallée, who in just a few years has become an A list Hollywood director with films like Dallas Buyers Club (which won Matthew McConaughey the Best Actor Oscar) and Wild (which won Reece Witherspoon a Best Actress Oscar nomination). Here, Vallée examines the aftermath of an unexpected death and the unintended consequences on the survivor(s). Gyllenhaal, who has been on a hot streak recently with movies like Nightcrawler, Southpaw, and Everest, brings yet another excellent performance as the tormented Davis. Naomi Watts as the vendor customer representative seems to not age a day as the years go by, but the best supporting performance comes from young Judah Lewis as her 15 yr. old son (he previously was in Deliverance Creek), and surely we will see much more of him in the years to come. At one point, Davis and Chris are arguing about Chris' frequent use of the F word, to which Davis responds ""I feel nothing, and you're an idiot"". Don't let it be said that this movie sugarcoats anyone's feelings! Chris Cooper as Davis' father-in-law Phil, or as Davis puts it, F-I-L, ha!) is heavy-handed, almost to a fault. It takes a long time to feel emotionally invested in these characters, and even then it feels fleeting. Last but certainly not least, the movie features plenty of great music, including Heart's classic ""Crazy On You"" in a key scene, but even better is the use of the key instrumental part of My Morning Jacket's ""Touch Me I'm Going to Scream (Pt. 2)"" and later on Charles Aznavour's ""La Boheme"", and many more.""Demolition"" opened nationally this past weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Sunday matinée screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. I wasn't in the least surprised, as this movie is anything but uplifting.

Sadly his new offering, Demolition, veers into Wes Anderson territory—a veritable quirk fest that does a disservice to its tragic subject matter.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Davis Mitchell, a successful investment banker, who's driving home with his wife Julia when their car is T-boned by an unseen driver. When Davis wakes up in the hospital, he discovers that his wife is a fatality and he has survived virtually without a scratch.Screenwriter Bryan Sipe then proceeds to serve up a protagonist who's hardly believable in his pre-mourning incarnation. Davis appears as an unlikable automaton, completely cut off from his emotions. After a package of M&M's get stuck in a vending machine at the hospital, he bizarrely begins a letter writing campaign to the customer service department of the vending machine company. In a series of letters (narrated as voice overs), Davis clinically explicates his past life experiences prior to the accident.Soon afterward, he shows up for work shortly after the funeral, much to the chagrin of his father-in-law Phil, who owns the investment company where he works. Davis' mourning process is a quirky one indeed as he feels a compulsion to take everything apart--which includes dismantling the bathroom stall at work. It's Phil who suggests he take a leave of absence.At this point, Davis meets up with Karen (Naomi Watts), a customer service rep at the vending company, who has been moved by his letters and is just as quirky as him. Karen lives with Carl, her boss, along with her 15 year old son, Chris (newcomer Judah Lewis). When Carl goes away on an extended business trip, Davis develops a platonic friendship with Karen and stays over at her house.Karen proves a weak character with little to do, but it's Judah Lewis as her foul-mouthed son who steals the show. Lewis has natural acting talent playing Chris, the juvenile delinquent who eventually bonds with Davis, confessing to him that he might be gay. Davis becomes a mentor to Chris as he enters the deeper anger phase of his mourning process. First he conscripts his young charge to accompany him as he demolishes his own home. Later, he encourages Chris to shoot him in the chest with live ammunition while wearing a bullet-proof vest. Davis' mourning period concludes when reality rears its ugly head. First Davis is worked over by a jealous Carl but worse yet is Chris, who ends up in a coma after being beaten up for coming out. There's more heartache for Davis when he learns that Julia was pregnant with another man's child before she was killed.I suppose all this was enough for Davis to transform into a mensch and that's exactly what happens at film's end when he reconciles with both his father and mother-in-law and asks for their help in refurbishing a carousel, as a living memorial for Julia.Demolition is an original concept in that it treats the mourning process as a black comedy of sorts. But most of Davis' actions, as he goes through his catharsis, are grating and unpleasant. The contrast between the unemotional Davis whom we meet right after the accident and the quirky man who needs to let out his anger in a big way, demolishing everything in his path, proves to be tiresome. Ultimately Davis' farcical ""blowing off steam"" is too negative to appeal to the viewer who desperately would like to feel something for the film's main character. Davis' sudden transformation into a completely sensitive, caring guy is a welcome twist after all the negativity, but hardly exhibits much verisimilitude.Gyllenhaal can do little with a script that makes its protagonist a running joke. And the aforementioned Watts is completely upstaged by the teenager with a much juicier part.Demolition garnered mixed reviews from the critics. While the main character's internal arc reveals a true progression leading to significant change, there is a sense here that the protagonist's core is not only unlikable but too unbelievable to be true.",Demolition
25,iquine,Tear Down To Rebuild,5,29 June 2019,"(Flash Review)A man, who works in the finance industry, awakes from the fog of daily life after the death of his wife. He slowly becomes emotionally aware of the real world around him from nature, to life, to people as he had been numb to those for a long time. He starts to want to understand about things or people from the inside. He slowly begins to turn his life 180 degrees. Demolishing his existing life as therapy to move past this tragedy to find himself and direction. During this period his life crosses paths another woman who views life from a similar perspective. And their friendship as well as her child mentally assists them both. This movies uses blatant metaphors to address its points. Arguably heavy-handed or immature and by the end seemed rather unfinished or not satisfying as well as muddled and forgettable. Gyllenhaal does a great job with the material but this needed another draft or editing pass as the pacing felt uneven. Overall, it was moderately entertaining while being unsatisfying.",Demolition
26,jimbo-53-186511,"Begins well, but like its protagonist it soon falls apart",5,25 March 2017,"Davis Mitchell (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a successful investment banker working for his father-in-law's firm. Tragedy strikes for Davis when his wife Julia (Heather Lind) is killed in a car accident. Shortly after his wife is pronounced dead, Davis has a problem with a vending machine and writes several letters of complaint to the vending machine company, which leads to Davis striking up a friendship with Karen (Naomi Watts) a customer service representative at the vending machine company who is touched by the content of his letters. Davis, with the help of Karen, goes on a voyage of self-discovery after the death of his wife, but the unconventional methods he employs to deal with his wife's death don't meet with approval for those closest to him.Presumably, Demolition is intended as a character study and I can see that an interesting film could have been made out of the character of Davis - he's seemingly an emotionally-retarded man incapable of showing emotion or grief in the conventional sense of the word. In the opening segments of the film, his wife criticises him for not really paying attention, but later in the film we can see that he is actually observant and fairly regimental when going about his daily routine. To me though, it seemed that he only focuses his attention on what is important to him and isn't really interested in what is important to anyone else. The film suggests (as far as I could gather) that there may have been psychological issues with Davis - him being unable to emote or show concern over his wife's death and I really wish that these psychological issues would have had more bearing on the story.Davis' unconventional method of dealing with his wife's death is interesting in its early stages; his desire to open everything up and see how it works may have been a metaphor about his own existence - essentially stripping everything away about himself and rebuilding himself possibly as a better person. As things progress, Davis gets worse and worse and the moment he pays a group of builders to help them knock a house down is the point where we start to learn that Davis is deeply troubled. This aspect of the story is quite interesting and fun to watch (for a while), but once we get to this point there isn't really any further development of Gyllenhaal's character and at this point in the film it goes from being fun and interesting to being tiresome and repetitive.As well as Davis' own life struggle the film has other threads such as Karen's marital problems and her son Chris and his struggle with his sexuality. These themes are littered throughout the film and are covered in dribs and drabs, but never really to an extent that you're able to become emotionally invested in these themes or in the characters. Admittedly, the former thread isn't that interesting, but the latter theme is and perhaps could have been expanded further. I think this is part of the problem with this film in that it has lots of ideas and themes, but at 98 minutes long it perhaps doesn't have the running time to develop all of its ideas and as a result it comes across as being a bit muddled and cluttered at times.Still the acting is pretty good and it is interesting in its early stages and despite some of its problems it never falls into the realms of being unwatchable, but at the same time it's never as interesting as it could have been and when the film ended I felt as though I knew as much about Davis at the end as I did at the start. In my book, Demolition is something of a failure, but it is, at least at times, a moderately interesting failure.",Demolition
27,yusufpiskin,Judah Lewis,8,27 December 2019,"I'm the kind of guy who buries everything deep down. If someone close to me died, you wouldn't know it unless I told you. If I got fired or failed a class, my general demeanor wouldn't change enough to be noticeable. I internalize everything, burying it deep down inside and doing my best to ignore until eventually, it just goes away or the world solves the problem for me. It's a quietly destructive system of dealing with hardships, but from my experience I think I would prefer it to the alternate, more vocal and public approach. People often deem this method unhealthy, something I vehemently disagree with. I'm a put together individual, relatively mature and pretty steadfast in my fundamental beliefs and morality, especially considering I'm 19. Demolition is one of the first films I've seen that seemed to reflect my methods for dealing with stress (on some level anyways) that didn't ultimately indict them. I loved it.As a film, Demolition is a quiet powerhouse of emotion. Jake Gyllenhaal continues to justify his standing as one of the finest actors working right now, giving a quiet and darkly comedic performance that is absolutely fundamental to the success of the film. Naomi Watts, an incredible actress in her own right, seems a bit off kilter and awkward, but so is the character she is playing so I have no issues with her work here either. Jean-Marc Vallee's direction here is great as well, weaving a sort of confused story together through effective editing and a fundamental loyalty to the subdued mentality of it's protagonist. A quick look at RottenTomatoes and I see that many are calling this a ""slog"", or a film that doesn't necessarily reflect the tragedy of it's narrative. But Demolition takes place within Gyllenhaal's head, attempting to cinematically represent the process of internalizing grief and strife, which I feel inherently lends itself to a subdued atmosphere.But the moments that need to land do, mostly consisting of another character desperately trying to salvage any sort of emotional response from Gyllenhaal. I found the film to be profoundly relatable, perhaps the most I've ever seen in it's interpretation of grief and loss. Now let me make a few things clear. I'm 19, so I've never lost a wife, a child or a parent. I've never torn down my house or taken apart my fridge, and I've never really dealt with any stress outside of relationships (romantic and platonic), grandparents passing or dogs dying, school related stress or financial concerns. But stress is relative, and I saw myself in Gyllenhaal's journey. There was no scene with him crying himself to sleep, or breaking down at the deceased's gravestone. No constant screaming, anguish or turmoil. Life went on, and only those around him aroused any emotion following his wife's death.It's a fundamentally human film, masquerading as an absurdist comedy while dealing with some of life's most confounding scenarios. It's a film that tracks Gyllenhaal's breakdown, bravely painted with humor and melancholy alone. And amidst that insincerity the film finds some beauty in the breakdown, as Gyllenhaal eventually finds his answers within the rubble of his old life. I can sympathize with Demolition's detractors, but personally I found something really beautiful that I hope to cling to and appreciate further as I mature. I found a film that doesn't malign my mentality towards adversity, but rather explores it and tries to understand it. It's a film with sympathy for it's conflicted protagonist, and subsequently I found sympathy for myself in there as well.A personal favorite.",Demolition

They want a roller coaster to turn you upside down and make you puke!""",3,27 June 2016,"And that's about what I did at the end of this roller coaster movie.So many reviews here obsess on the supposed ""grief"" or ""grieving process"" Davis Mitchell is going through due to the death of his wife. Really? Did they actually watch the movie?Davis becomes self possessed and is rebelling against the decision he made to marry the ""rich girl' Julia! That's what this movie is about - self indulgence & rebelling - not grieving! Davis even tells Karen he married Julia because ""it was convenient"" in other words he sold himself out. He grew-up in an economic level that was equal to Karen's current life style. Therefore he connected with her and her son so easily.Davis's path of destruction is his effort to disconnect from the demanding lifestyle he was expected to live with his rich wife Julia and her very wealthy parents. His father-in-law Phil gives Davis a very nice job in his investment firm even after he told Davis he did not like him. We are lead to believe that Phil learns to like Davis but it is obvious both of them only tolerated one another. Phil accepted Davis only because he made a lot of money for the investment firm and his daughter married him!Davis only achieves demolishing his relationship with his co-workers, his in-laws, and his own possessions! Then out of the blue he learns 'the big secret' and decides to be a thoughtful former son-in-law.

29,peterp-450-298716,How to react after losing your wife in a tragic car accident? Jake Gyllenhaal does it in a weird way ...,7,18 August 2016,"""He's probably a crackhead. Crackheads don't give people $200. They suck dick for $20.""A film about the grieving process of a successful businessman after losing his wife in a terrible car accident. This isn't exactly the right ingredient for an entertaining or funny movie. To be honest, it took me some effort to watch the whole movie. Actually, I wasn't eager to watch another metaphorical film full of symbolism with Jake Gyllenhaal. Something similar as ""Enemy"". It's like Davis himself says in the film : ""For some reason, everything has become a metaphor"". Just admit it. The next situation really sounds absurd. Someone gets the news of his wife's death, while sitting in the waiting room of a hospital. It was a car accident and he doesn't have a scratch on him. The first thing that comes to his mind after hearing this, is getting a bag of M&M's from a vending machine. Unfortunately,it gets firmly stuck in the machine, which in turn leads to a correspondence between him and Karen (Naomi Watts), an employee of the vending machines company who works at the customers service department.And you think this sounds already strange and absurd? Wait till you see how Davis follows the advice of his father in law Phil (Chris Cooper). He interprets it very literally. Phil's advice was: ""If you wanna fix something ... You have to take everything apart ... and figure out what's important"". Before you know it, he begins to disassemble certain not so well-functioning devices. He takes it even a step further and starts working free of charge for a demolition company. Afterwards he seeks rapprochement to Karen and gets acquainted with her son Chris (Judah Lewis). Now his behavior becomes even more extreme. Chris seems to be a kindred spirit because of his doubts about his true sexual orientation. By the way, you can also enjoy a dazzling conversation between the two of them about the semantic meaning of the F-word.Among aspiring philosophers and future psychiatrists, debates can flourish about the symbolism in this film. Is Davis's behavior a reflection of his current situation? A slowly disintegrating personal life ? A defect in his mental machinery? Or is it a kind of ""Tabula rasa"" reaction, to start a new life? Again Gyllenhaal plays a slightly kooky character. Everyone assumes that a psychological short circuit is the cause of his eccentric behavior. Indisputable this kind of movie character is suitable for an actor like Gyllenhaal. After watching ""Nightcrawler"" I called him already the chameleon of Hollywood. This masterful actor has a natural flexibility to find the balance between a light manic mood and a natural relaxing moment with that amused and wondering gaze. A brilliant actor.Besides Jake Gyllenhaal, also Judah Lewis was a colorful figure. Even the father in law was an interesting character, despite his rather limited role. The only one who didn't have a high enough profile was Naomi Watts. A somewhat dull and colorless woman. A bit introverted due to some personal problems. I don't know whether this was because of Watts or the script. What surprised me most was the way the film succeeded in keeping me captivated more and more. What started as a totally absurd and crazy story, gradually evolved into a gloomy (and touching) story filled with cynical humor. Only the corny ending, full of forgiveness and repentance, was slightly disappointing. Ultimately, this wasn't a bad film (perseverance at the beginning is a must) with Gyllenhaal as a wacky individual. I wonder if he'll continue in this direction in his future projects.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",Demolition

Basically the film is about a man who loses his wife and doesn't really care about it..or anything for about 2 hours. This movie is just two hours of plot less scenes and Jake Gyellanhall trying to use the powers of his outstanding acting to make a movie without a plot worth watching. I mean, Gyellanhall is an outstanding actor but even he needs somewhat of a plot to work with. This felt like a no budget first time film student's last minute project. Like I said before, a letdown.

32,krocheav,Demolition Smashes Itself To Pieces,5,30 June 2017,"It's difficult to fully understand what writer Bryan Sipe and director/co-producer Jean-Marc Vallee we thinking when they fashioned this interesting but ultimately unsatisfying movie. As an examination of grief and the different ways we humans react to it – it might have been effective if it didn't continually stray into so many over the top messy situations. There are just too many foolish plot devices that lead this so-called study into the unbelievable. Firstly, we have to try to understand our lead becoming disenfranchised with his life after the death of his young wife in an auto accident – but it's difficult to sympathize - as it was made rather clear he tended to be this way before the fatal accident. In fact, it looked seriously like his marriage was headed for divorce because of his apparent detachments. Things quickly unravel further when he begins to demolish household items in his very pleasant modern house but, gets worse when this behaviour also carries over to items in the homes of those who reach out to him. Far too many overly strange occurrences drag this story off the rails into pretty much of a dishevelled mess. One particularly unpleasant sequence has him taking the foul-mouthed, troubled, and sexually 'confused' 15yr old son of a newly acquired female acquaintance to his home, then proceeds to smash the entire premises to pieces with demolishing sledgehammers – encouraging the lad to join in the carnage as if it were some 'fun' task. This, being just one of several irresponsible acts that either involves destruction or encouraging the young lad to shoot at him with a handgun - while he wears a bullet proof vest! In their attempts to be topical, controversial, or 'off-the-wall' these movie makers tend to sabotage their own work – assuring it becoming the failure it certainly was. Only redeeming features are some OK performances, photography, and use of a few good song selections.Those who look for movies that deliberately set out to ""rock the boat"" will think this pretty good – but, with a box office return of around $4million out of a $10million budget - it would seem most found it unsettling or ultimately boring. Pity, with a little more controlled treatment it may have been far more involving.",Demolition
33,Anurag-Shetty,A strange yet brilliant film.,9,13 April 2016,"Demolition tells the story of Davis(Jake Gyllenhaal). Davis is a successful investment banker, who lives a very mundane life. He is married to Julia(Heather Lind). Davis loses Julia in a tragic car accident. The sadder part is, Davis was in the car with Julia & escaped, unscathed. For some strange reason, Davis doesn't seem to be too affected by Julia's demise. He writes a complaint letter to a vending machine company, about a faulty vending machine. Instead, Davis starts writing down all the details, leading up to his wife's sudden death. This catches the attention of a customer sales representative for the vending machine company, named Karen(Naomi Watts). She is intrigued by Davis' letters. Davis & Karen exchange letters, back & forth. They form an unlikely bond. Demolition is a fantastic movie. It is also very unconventional. Director Jean-Marc Valee makes another masterpiece, after Dallas Buyers Club(2013). There are lots of comedic set pieces in the film, that will make you guffaw uncontrollably. The scenes where Davis destroys things, are disturbing yet fun to watch. The script by Bryan Sipe, is one of a kind. The cinematography by Yves Belanger is breathtaking. The only problem I had with this film, is that the behavior the protagonist exhibits is not natural & will mostly not happen in real life. However, this is just my personal gripe with the movie. The performances are the highlight of the film. Jake Gyllenhaal is mind blowing as Davis. Gyllenhaal continues to show his wide range, with the variety of roles he chooses. Apart from his acting chops, Jake Gyllenhaal thoroughly entertains us, with his impromptu dances in the movie. Naomi Watts is spectacular as Karen. Gyllenhaal & Watts, share a natural & warm camaraderie in their scenes together. Chris Cooper is great as Phil. Judah Lewis is outstanding as Chris. Lewis is supremely talented & has a bright future in Hollywood. C.J. Wilson is impressive as Carl. Polly Draper is good as Margot. Heather Lind is superb as Julia. Demolition is a must watch, for fans of offbeat indie dramedies. Skip this one, if you don't like movies where, the characters exhibit disturbing behavior.",Demolition
34,dave-mcclain,Demolition is what this movie does to a Movie Fan's hopes for two hours of quality entertainment.,1,14 April 2016,"Sometimes I try to work a pun or a play on words into my movie reviews. Often, those are based on the title of the movie I'm reviewing or something about it. In these moments, I'm hoping to be funny or at least a little amusing or clever. It's tough to know whether my readers think that those attempts make my reviews more enjoyable to read, but at least I'm entertaining myself. I try not to make the most obvious puns regarding a given movie, but sometimes filmmakers seem to be handing me a pun on a silver platter and I feel that I have no choice but to partake. (After all, if something's on a silver platter, it has to be good, right?) Therefore, as I prepare to review the drama ""Demolition"" (R, 1:41) I will be as fair as I can, as is my habit, but I will indeed be demolishing this movie.Davis Mitchell (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a successful New York City investment banker who is better at high finance than he is at marriage. Davis loves his wife, Julia (Heather Lind), but he has never taken the time or put forth the effort to get to know her deeply so that his love for her can grow and his commitment to her deepen. Instead, after just a few years of marriage, she is killed in a car crash and Davis doesn't seem to feel much of anything. It seems that everyone around him is grieving, especially Julia's father, Phil Eastman (Chris Cooper), who also happens to be Davis' boss. Co-workers offer Davis heart-felt condolences, but he politely dismisses them without a trace of emotion. In fact, Davis comes in to work the day after his wife's funeral, acting no more upset than if his favorite football team had lost a big game. Phil continually does his best to help Davis grieve properly, but two men who should have grown closer as they supported each other are instead driven apart by Davis' increasingly bizarre behavior.We don't see Davis grieve in any recognizable way, instead keeping his own spirits fairly high as he does whatever he feels like doing, not engendering sympathy from those around him, but further alienating himself from them. First, he takes way too far some questionable advice Phil once gave him about fixing things by taking them apart and then putting them back together again. He starts by disassembling the refrigerator that Julia had been asking him to fix, but he doesn't fix anything or put it back together. Then, for no apparent reason, he takes apart an expensive unopened cappuccino machine that Julia had recently ordered, then his work computer, then a stall in the men's restroom at work. He also has begun writing complaint letters to the vending company whose machine failed to dispense some candy that he tried to buy ten minutes after he learned of his wife's death. His letters go into lengthy stories about his marriage and his thoughts, but with no real emotion or regret. Just the facts. Just because. No more.The customer service rep from the vending company, an Afghanistan war widow named Karen (Naomi Watts) responds and an unlikely friendship grows between her and Davis. She first contacts him via a 2 a.m. phone call to Davis' home and their exchanges get even stranger from there. Eventually, they meet and Davis befriends Karen and her surly teenage son, Judah (Chris Moreno), while raising ire in Karen's live-in boyfriend, Carl (C.J. Wilson), who also happens to be Karen's boss. Meanwhile, Davis steps up his destructive activities by joining a work crew demolishing a house (and paying THEM for the privilege). Then he turns his attention to his own up-scale suburban home, with Judah along for the fun. Phil has been trying to involve Davis in an effort to establish a scholarship fund in Julia's memory, but what Phil sees as unreliable, increasingly unhinged and disrespectful behavior from Davis pushes Phil past his limits of understanding and tolerance. A few plot twists late in the film increase the drama, but fail to bring the story to even a remotely satisfying conclusion. The resolution that we end up getting falls squarely in the category of ""too little too late"", doing only a mediocre job of making important points.""Demolition"" is a good title for a movie which so completely destroys any possibility that audiences might enjoy or even be touched by the story. Every single major character in this movie is so self-centered and does so many ridiculous things that they become completely unlikeable and not even relatable. I can't go into more detail without resorting to spoilers, but using a plot point I already mentioned (and which is prominently featured in the theatrical trailer), Davis' complete destruction of his own home is so pointless, over-the-top and wasteful that it's nearly impossible to appreciate visually or emotionally. This is not some guy (and a teenage boy) doing something that we might enjoy participating in. It's just stupid and utterly ridiculous.Besides exposing Judah to the hazards and poor judgment involved in wantonly destroying an expensive house, Davis is a horrible influence on Judah in other ways. As their odd friendship grows, Davis gives Judah terrible and dangerous advice about a major decision Judah is trying to make. And another idea that Davis has for the two of them to release some pent-up aggression isn't just extremely dangerous, but gives ideas to younger audience members that could actually cost lives. There are many plot points in this film that are upsetting and uncomfortable to watch, and virtually irrelevant to the growth of the characters (which, in spite of this great cast, are only marginally well-acted). This film makes a mockery of the grieving process and irresponsibly condones some extreme behavior by both adults and children. Demolition is what this movie does to an audience's hopes for two hours of quality entertainment. ""D""",Demolition
35,maccas-56367,A powerful film with excellent Gyllenhaal performance,8,27 April 2021,"Quite a powerful film that dives headfirst into a range of heavy themes and storylines.Gyllenhaal and Cooper are phenomenal in their respective roles and reminded me why they're two of my favourite actors. It had been a while since I last saw them together in October Sky. Naomi Watts does a great job in her role of Karen too. She has a unique chemistry with Gyllenhaal.Demolition is a film about grief and dramatic changes in life. It's about learning to ""feel"". I could relate to elements of that, as that numbness is something that has crept into my own life. I thought the film depicted grief excellently, and Gyllenhaal's performance really added an unhinged authenticity in its portrayal.The film is as much about loneliness and finding your place in life too. Davis' grief-stricken letters to Karen, weren't too far removed from my own correspondence with a wildlife services officer named Charlotte years ago (about water rats and otters) when dealing with my own grief and life changes.There is some dark humour and a killer soundtrack too, which made me smile.

38,PyroSikTh,A Study of the Numbness of Grief,7,3 May 2016,"Banker Davis has just lost his wife suddenly in a car accident and finds himself numb and disconnected to everyone and everything around him. Unlike a lot of movies that study grief with a touch of melancholy, Demolition felt unique in it's approach to a character emotionally numbed. Davis feels nothing; no sadness, no regret, no anger, he just is, much to the chagrin of those around him who expect more of an emotional response. Instead Davis embarks on metaphorically and literally deconstructing his life, forging a friendship with a customer service rep and her son along the way. It's this unique way of looking at a different method of mourning that sets Demolition apart.My only real problem is that the ending felt a little unsatisfactory. The third act is definitely full of climaxes and surprises, but even though Davis has completed his journey of grief and finally succumbed to his emotions, it still feels like there's a lot more story to tell. A lot of the climaxes and surprises don't bring any kind of closure, but instead open up new story directions that get left hanging.Jake Gyllenhaal is once again spectacular as Davis. As a man who has everything you might dream of and doesn't want any of it, Gyllenhaal brings a surprising amount of complexity to a character who spends half the movie not showing any kind of emotion at all. We don't spend a lot of time with his character before the accident, but afterwards he's very matter-of-fact and to the point. As the movie progresses, his grief evolves into something a little more eccentric as he celebrates feeling physical pain, ditches most of his ties to his lucrative lifestyle, and forges a real chemistry with Karen and her son Chris.Naomi Watts and Chris Cooper do really well as Karen and Phil respectively, supporting Gyllenhaal wherever he needs it. She's a middle-aged stoner who finds redemption in Davis' letters to her, and he's a successful businessman who grieves the loss of his daughter as you might typically expect; with tears and angry outbursts. However it's Judah Lewis as Chris who shares the best chemistry with Gyllenhaal. Chris is a confused teenager attempting to discover his identity between rock music and 80s music icons, and Lewis just adds that extra touch that not only makes the teenager believable, but also relatable.Also of note is the editing, which includes some really good cuts and flashbacks that paint a bit of a picture of Julia without ever focussing on one single moment. There's a quick flash early on of a CGI gecko that feels like a really bizarre metaphor, but as the movie goes on it makes a little more sense. These quick little montages also act as a glimpse into Davis' own mind as he explores memories and ideas.Demolition was a thoroughly enjoyable view. It's rather bleak subject matter could've made for a really dreary or hyper-emotive movie, but instead it keeps a more even tone with the odd few jokes. Nothing that'll make you laugh out loud, but they act as snippets of light and are sure to bring a smile to your face. If nothing else, it's a movie that made me really introspective on the journey home, so it certainly had a degree of impact on me emotionally.

Deborah Monk was born that day so shuffled movies she was a named character in.Demolition was the result and I am actually pleased as I would likely have ignored this movie.

40,DLochner,"A great Gyllenhaal, a bumpy story",7,14 March 2021,"Jake Gyllenhaal is known for its outstanding performance. You can also see his great talent in this film. A man who dismantles his entire life after a life crisis. Nevertheless, the story of the film in particular remains very bumpy and opaque. Director Jean-Marc Vallée has already made an outstanding film With Dallas Buyers Clubs. Unfortunately, ""Demolition"" cannot keep up here. But his actors are all the better.",Demolition
41,scottshak_111,A twisted drama!,7,29 April 2016,"Comes another melodramatic venture from the beautiful head of Jean-Marc Vallee, Demolition is a movie not for everyone. Whilst I personally love his direction, in the back of the head I get this feeling it might overwhelm some with apathy.Demolition lets you delve into the head of a guy who goes rogue on account of a recent mishap. Jake Gyllenhaal gets into the skin of Davis, a guy who doesn't pay much attention to what's going on around him, until he does. The world we behold then is brimming up with his insanity, and he seems at one point to have reached heights of the inane. Some of his acts seem really fatuous but some instigated. But it is the constant struggle between the two that the director pushes us toward which makes things hard to digest.Jake Gyllenhaal is, no doubt, outstanding as the protagonist who loses it all in the very beginning frames of the movie. It unfolds into a great sojourn as people make an effort to fathom his fatuous acts, which he justifies through his phenomenal explanatory yet endearing letters to Karen, a character we see appear out of the blue. For some moments, you will have a hard time wrapping your head around the mist she appears from. At one junction, I took her for a figment, but then when we see her world unfurling with more twisted people, things kind of sediment.You see a sub-plot protruding right then with the inclusion of Chris to the tale. The side story comes more as a helping hand to see the thrilling side of demolishing something, a secondary perspective which tries to address a persisting LGBT issue too. It is weird how with those moments with Chris, Karen disappears completely only to return when she is needed for the movie. A sense of disconnect that makes things impalpable. In his strides towards the extraordinaire, Jean-Marc Vallee often misses out on the flick's substance.Watching Jake groove to the beats was one of the most amusing and cool parts. His carefree reckless dancing makes you fall in love with him even more. Watching him rip apart everything he thinks beautiful, gives you a silent satisfaction. To feel that relatable urge to annihilate things to tatters, was a reassuring contended sight. Albeit it becomes very difficult to relate to his character after one point, owing to some humorous bits in the movie, which seemed more like a deliberate attempt to aid the movie into reaching its climax, which was also quite fromward from its original steer. But the climax unravels with a punch in a gorgeous fashion that covers up for the indifference that we face midway.The fact that Julia bides by and stays impregnated in Davis' chores has been beautifully depicted. The way she gets mirrored to him every time goes on to show – no matter how aloof you are from someone your head somehow finds them through regular habits.Screenplay of Bryan Sipe goes brilliant at times but ambles quietly on a constant high and low road. Chris Cooper does a very thoughtful loving and caring dad that almost breaks you up, if it weren't for the callous Davis demeanour to put you back in his mood.SPOILERS AHEAD: One of the most powerful parts of the movie is Davis' resurrection, as he feels sorry for his acts, and actually starts to miss Julia. That's when he pulls himself together to meet a stranger who visits her grave. Mistook for the guy whom she was dating before her death, Davis decides to acknowledge him only to find out he was the guy responsible for the accident. It puts you in your brooding gears.I could totally understand what the director is feeling when he tries to jog us down through that grieving lane. Unfortunately, he fails to connect us to his thoughts. With demolition, he couldn't really open up wide and audaciously to the public.",Demolition
42,yris2002,"good picture, solid message and strong performances",7,18 September 2016,"We must destroy in order to rebuild: the message of the picture is clear, I would say very physically clear, since there's much physical destruction, and I found it a very empathetically convincing message, since who has never felt like destroying a place, just to get rid of the past, of something we hate or no longer stand? The story develops with a steady and quick pace, but is also intertwined by dreamy moments, which soften the overall realistic attitude of the movie. The incisive soundtrack is also wisely chosen to give more value to some emotionally intense moments or to enliven the atmosphere. The cast does a great job, Jake Gyllenhall truly inhabits his difficult and at times incomprehensible character, and is worthily supported by a never disappointing Naomi Watts, and the little boy offers a good performance, too. On the whole an enjoyable and also thought provoking picture, which leaves much to think about what could lie beneath the ruins if we had the courage to deconstruct the more or less frail scaffold of our existence.",Demolition

45,CineCritic2517,Just terrible..,1,22 February 2016,"After his wife is killed in a car crash, Davis Mitchell (Gyllenhaal) deals with the lack of feeling any emotions by demolishing buildings, furniture and household appliances. He also befriends a customer service employee from a vending machine company. Probably meant as a comedy of sorts, the film is totally ridiculous, not entertaining and insulting to the intelligence. The absurdity of the Gyllenhaal character and his love interest doesn't match the universe of the other characters in the movie which results in a total disconnect for the viewer.

49,SpoilerAlertReviews,Destructive yet inspiring... depending on your current frame of life,9,30 April 2016,"I don't know where to start simply because I have been inspired and currently distracted by my own thoughts. Yes, inspired by Jean-Marc Vallee wonderful, yet strange tale of self exploration. It's something I can kinda relate to and I'm pretty sure many of us can too to some degree. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Davis, a man who has been totally blindsided by the normality of life, becoming complacent and neglectful of the happenings around him. Disconnected, the death of his wife starts a spiral of events that would lead him down a childlike road of rediscovery. He gets a sudden spark of new found curiosity which leads him to deconstruct, destroy and disengage with the ordinariness of his lifestyle. All the while, inadvertently affecting those around him, pushing away the old and replenishing with the new. It isn't just him we witness go through the motions but we see the emotional impact HE has on his In-laws, in particular his Father-In-Law, Phil (Chris Cooper) and the impulsive attraction with his new friend Karen and her troubled son Chris. His In-laws go through grief, anger, confusion and frustration and forgiveness while he becomes borderline crazy and eventually reaches his grief. Stemming from Davis' elaborate letter of complaint to the vending machine company regarding his non-receivable peanut M&Ms, he opens up, writing an honest, unconventional complaint and customer service lady, Karen (Naomi Watts) can't help but inappropriately attempts contact with Davis' which blooms into a joyous friendship and her character symbolises that innocent attraction I believe many of us seek. As their friendship grows, a bond forms between her son (Judah Lewis) and Davis, bringing more excitement, discovery and demolition. It's great that the relationship Karen and Davis share is not sexually but purely on attraction. Taking time to get to know each other, talking and listening, having sleep-overs. It's an element of real romance that isn't portrayed in other films very well, or ignored. Maybe a sense of longing they both have had for a very long time, even through marriage. Leaves you with a lot of 'what ifs'. It's brilliantly written, well scripted and the whole cast bring it to life accompanied by a great soundtrack.

50,lucasnochez,Film Review: Demolition,5,23 August 2016,"Grief is a funny thing; its affects on people change not only the person experiencing such a powerful and life-altering emotion, but it changes the way people around you view you, and the choices people make around you. One of the many emotions and reflections that the film allowed me to analyze was, thankfully for myself, the lack of grief that I have had to experience in my life thus far, and the amount of grief stricken in the world around me, with numerous people who have directly dealt with lose first-hand in my life everyday. Jean-Marc Vallée, the director of many heavy-handed drama films like C.R.A.Z.Y., The Young Victoria, The Dallas Buyers Club, Café de Flore and Wild, really loves to make movies with heavy use of symbolism. In his newest directorial effort, Demolition, the symbolism for the deconstruction of Davis' life, played unflinchingly by the always stellar Jake Gyllenhaal, really doesn't hold back its explicit nature. Living an overall numb life from the moment we meet him, Davis seems to live each and everyday with very little to almost no real, pure emotions. Rather, explaining the paths of his life with monotone vigour, including the timeline of his wife's life, their meeting, and ultimately, her tragic death, Davis becomes avery difficult man to like, in all aspects of his life.What's funny about Demolition is, the film's life begins with Julia's (Heather Lind) death. In some of the very first and brief scenes of the film, we see Julia and Davis interact, almost as any other couple would; comfortable, passively and without much conviction. What starts off as a simple conversation in the car between husband and wife, quickly turns deadly, as the car is hit, Davis is bloody in a hospital waiting room with his in-laws Fil and Margot (Chris Cooper and Polly Draper) waiting on the news of his wife's fate. As we see in the trailer, Julia never makes it. Fortunately for us, Vallée has an amazing way of allowing audiences to see an obscure and unexplored perspective on so many moments we come to expect to see in film, and turns them on its head. For example, after the news of Julia's death, Davis makes his way into the operating room where his wife once laid. The room, empty and full of blood on the floors, white operating sheets and medical tools used to attempt to save her life, is one of the first very poignant images Vallée has become famous with offering, giving perspective on the very real images of life, more specifically, on a moment many people never really see or associate with death on a hospital bed; an empty bed with nothing but blood and shattered prayers.As the early reviews of this film began to flood online after its initial premiere and choice as the opening night film for TIFF 40 in 2015, Demolition has seem to be one universally accepted film to divide people. Going into the film, I was wondering why. I mean, Gyllenhaal is one of the supreme acting forces of our young generation, Vallée is an excellent storyteller and director, and the supporting cast and crew is nothing short of talented, yet, the film, scripted by Bryan Sipe tells a very discombobulated tale of one many's very operatic struggle to cope with one of two things; the death of his wife, or the realization that he was never in love with the woman he was married to. The film begins to show, not why, but, all the if's in Davis' life.At times, do not get me wrong, Vallée's film is nothing short of emotional. But the emotions cannot be ignored to being very manipulative, using scenes of loss and confusion to justify erratic behaviour of characters whose backstories are mostly absent to us. For one, Davis, we come to the understanding early, suffers from common emotional displays of affection and genuine love, yet, without spoiling the ending of the film, does offer many questions to the audiences. Why does he choose a path of destruction for answers? What are his obsessions with others? Why is he fascinated with certain people and not others? The film, which is suppose to be a very realistic, post-trauma film humanizing the loss and pain people feel during times of distress and disbelief, becomes a very segregated film about the pains and struggles about real people, living very real lives, doing very cinematically pleasing things. One of my biggest peeves with the film is showing too much about the stress and grief of Davis' loss,and less with the understanding why he is like this, who he was before and what he was like when he was married.",Demolition
51,Twins65,Probably the most-original movie I've seen in quite some time,6,2 February 2017,"but that doesn't make it any more believable. I finally saw ""Demolition"" after seeing the trailer for it almost two years ago, and I'm glad I watched it. Once again, Jake Gyllenhaal has ventured into the world of smaller dramas after ""Prince of Persia"" crashed and burned at the box office to mostly positive results. It sure helped to have a decent cast, as all of the supporting actors were quite good (Cooper, Watts, glimpses of the alluring Heather Lind and newcomer Judah Lewis),I bought in on most of the story, including a guy somehow getting upset at getting burned by a vending machine mere minutes after his wife dies and writing letters to the vending company looking for retribution. He was obviously a bit off-center to begin with, and certainly went over the edge after her death. But there were a couple of things that just didn't hold up. There's no way a guy could literally destroy the inside AND OUTSIDE of his house in an upscale neighborhood and not get either questioned and/or arrested for disorderly conduct. Nary a neighbor nor the police seemed to be alarmed that a guy was throwing sledge hammers out of his picture windows and later driving a heavy equipment top-loader into the front wall of his house! It just didn't ring true. And don't get me started about the scene where an untrained 13 year- old kid fires a pistol (TWICE!) at somebody wearing a bulletproof vest!But the final act had a decent payoff, and I'm still recommending you check this one out.",Demolition
52,Moviegoer19,A Confused Mess,5,16 July 2016,"The best thing about this movie, as many reviewers have already said, is Jake Gyllenhaal, because he is an excellent actor. Naomi Watts is usually a pleasure to watch too, but this script didn't give her much to work with.The premise is fine; the way it's executed is not. There's too much that doesn't make sense. Actually, I think I was lost early on when I saw Davis driving to and from White Plains, NY and Scarsdale, NY (supposedly) by going through the Queens Midtown Tunnel and over the Queensborough Bridge! If that had been the only goof, well, OK, but there was more that didn't jibe or make sense.One example is that here is Davis going through this major grieving process, yet he gives more than one statement which indicates he didn't really love his wife. OK, maybe he's grieving for his lost chance to really love her? Maybe.Another is that he tells his father in law, Chris Cooper, that he's suddenly interested in taking things apart and seeing how they work. But doesn't he really get pleasure just out of demolishing things? When does he actually seek to understand the inner workings of something? Isn't this why the film has the title it does?The Naomi Watts character is superficial and inconsistent, and without depth. The presence of her confused teenage son also seems gratuitous.The presence of the station wagon following Davis - I didn't understand this until I read the explanation here in the Discussion Board. Something should have connected it for the viewers' understanding. There were a few humorous lines. Also the soundtrack was good, though the rationale for some of the songs was unclear and they also seemed gratuitous.",Demolition
53,danielharden,Smashing,7,11 April 2016,"Funny, endearing and with meaning and morals to boot, Demolition takes us on a journey of unconventional methods of coming to terms with the death of a loved one. The Jake Gyllenhaal starring film is wonderfully weird and quaintly quirky.The acting was solid throughout, Everyone was fine, the child actor wasn't bad and was actually quite good. The film really is essentially a character piece about Jake Gyllenhaal's character Davis, to which the actor portrays brilliantly. Jake Gyllenhaal is amazing in this film, he'll make you laugh and cry and will even do both at the same time himself. The character is rather complex and honest as hell and Gyllenhaal is phenomenal as the investment banker.The Script was superb. The characters are so lovably odd from the emotionally complex Davis to the coming-of-age Chris. The dialogue is critical in creating these bizarre people through many random and often awkward conversations and topics. Events to which transpire over the course of the film are symbolically surreal giving further and more detailed understanding as to character emotions as well as why they are even happening at all.The Direction was great. Jean-Marc Vallee delivers his beautiful vision along with exceptional editing as they position us as Davis and allow us as an audience to understand and feel for, and in the same way as, this man in every situation he finds himself in.

The initial act is promising and is even carried out nicely, but as soon as the drive, or lack thereof, of Gyllenhall's character is presented and played out, the film spirals out of control checking every clichéd box and ironically becoming even more aimless as the character himself.

Many people passed through moments that are depicted in this movie, but how many of them behave in such that idiotic way?
Is it really an adult behavior destroying a wonderful and expensive house? How an adult is supposed to teach something to a teenager showing a totally irresponsible behavior? Putting a bulletproof vest on and inviting a teen to shoot him, or saying to him... yes, maybe you're a gay.
I don't know what to say, it could be much better, but probably it would have been ""normal"" and normality doesn't pay.

56,stonedraim,Demolition; that is a two street experience.,7,26 June 2016,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.A warning! It feels like it is my responsible to acknowledge and clarify that the way that the character Davis is giving advice, treating people around him, throws away all that people has been striving for (including a complete luxury house) and the influence he brings on the character of Chris is...horrible....terrible...awful... mean. I take offense in that way and reacted strongly about those things. As said many times before; the more everybody in every way is getting something attention, the more of that thing will become. I want love, respect, community, friendship, attention and confirmation in a feel good and positive way. With that said....Very interesting beginning. From an ordinary social dialogue between a man and a woman in a car... talking about ordinary things. Then; BOOM! Crash! Cut and cut and cut in the heartbeats. She is dead. He is at the hospital. And so the story rolls out. Jake Gyllenhaal puts the depth into his character. Davis (Mr. Gyllenhaal) is taken in a very innovative way as the writer Brian Sipe has made it clear that the struggling man of Davis should begin a journey to reach his emotions when writing to a company about their machine with M&M's. In grief, you do a demolition on your heart and soul. You examine everything and then puts it back together. Well.... Davis Mitchell is in demolition mode... in the real world. He tear things apart, and then just leaves. Somewhere he has gotten lost in his own life. A psychiatrist once said that when something tragic and/or big happens in your life, it is like every tool that you have mentally discovered, earned and/or created yourselves is spread all over a vast field with high grass. Now, you have to find them and learn how to use them again. As Davis Mitchell himself says; ""From now on.... it's me and my tools.""As many motion pictures, series and scripts today, this is also one that touches and reaches for social, ethical and moral issues. Is love out there? Is love just a social claim that we, the humans, ourselves has ended up creating to feel safe and secure? Is marriage something that will pass into the history? Is it right or wrong (or nothing) to be in a partnership just for the reasons of social benefits and the emotions of belonging to something? This story is heavy, for those who appreciate the topics of life. This story is a little strange and gives many thoughts. Do you like contemplating and dive into the human soul, see this movie. Jake Gyllenhaal is on a journey of making his own character in innovative roles. He will surely make it.There is some honestly funny dialogue here to be found in the film; Chris (Judah Lewis): Are you ""f**king"" my mom? She's ""f**ked"" up. Davis: You say ""f**k"" a lot. Chris: My mom is a ""f**king"" pothead. Davis: ""F**k"" is a great word... you just have to use it properly. Chris; What the ""f**K"" do you mean? Davis: If you use the word ""f**k"" all the time, it will lose its value. Chris: ""F**k"" you! Davis: Exactly.Oh...a personal question, in the middle of all things; Do you drive a station wagon?Over to the movie as a product: - The production : American Hollywood standard. Light, sound, visuals, editing is just in place. - The actors : Jake Gyllenhaal is surely a great actor. He can grasp and put out there the vast and difficult complexity of humans. - The story : Interesting and important. From a tragedy to a social and mental travel through a mans life. - Entertainment : Slow, heavy... and almost boring at some times. - Age : 157,1 out of 10.

61,Manal1987,Demolition: The Blissful Beauty of Destruction,10,13 April 2016,"""Together, they would watch everything that was so carefully planned collapse, and they would smile at the beauty of destruction."" Markus Zusak, The Book ThiefSometimes all you need is one piece to fall off the seemingly perfect construct you've built around yourself. Only then, you'll realize what's been long buried beneath and almost forgotten. That one piece was the tragic death of Davis' wife in a car accident in the revelatory opening sequence of Demolition.Davis (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a young banker who is married to Julia, his boss's daughter, and, from an outsider's point of view, seems to have his life all figured out. Davis' subsequent emotional numbness and irrational behavior become a source of persistent annoyance to everyone around him, leading him to realize his own metaphorical death which is brought about by Julia's tragic, yet necessary, death – it is the one piece that had to come apart so that Davis would notice the malfunction of his ostensibly ideal life, just like the leaking fridge in his kitchen. And this is when he decides to take everything in his life apart to get to the bottom of who he really is and how he really feels. On his journey of self- exploration, Davis crosses paths with Karen (Naomi Watts), a customer service representative of a small vending machines company, and her rebellious 15-year-old son, Chris (Judah Lewis).I don't think I ever wanted this movie to end. I've watched it twice so far and I'm still overwhelmed by the emotional genius of both screen writer Bryan Sipe and director Jean-Marc Vallée (Dallas Buyers Club, Wild). Following Davis' course of thinking, I've been trying to take things apart in this movie to understand why I loved it so much and why I end up crying like babies every time, but I just can't put my hand on one thing – it's simply everything. Not a single scene nor a single line in Demolition felt redundant or slightly detaching; they are all beautifully connected like notes in a musical piece, all leading up in an emotional crescendo to an inevitable coda that lingers way after the film ends. And despite the excessive use of montage, it all felt natural and poetic in a way. This is one film made with passion.Peering into the nature of human relationships is extremely difficult, not to mention trying to dismantle them. That's why Davis' fumbling through his existential ordeal changes from irrational to funny to understandable to incredibly relatable. We don't only take pleasure in watching Davis taking his life apart but we envy him for this melancholic yet euphoric realization of the truth that usually comes after destruction, and which we all yearn for in one way or another. Destroying entails thinking in retrospect, necessarily resulting in painful regret but one that is usually accompanied by blissful realization. Few are the movies that manage to go that deep into human relationships and come back with a bittersweet sense of salvation. Also, the unlikely relationship between Davis, Karen and her son Chris becomes a psychological shelter for the three emotionally misled characters where they get to nurture their empathy and readjust their inner compasses.The chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Judah Lewis is undeniable, and is highlighted by Sipe's witty script and both actors' topnotch performance. Gyllenhaal's growing acting skills are literally getting out of control (and I mean it in a good way). I don't think anyone could have portrayed Davis as harmoniously as he did, putting you in tears while bringing a smile to your face. After Enemy, Nightcrawler, and Southpaw, Gyllenhaal is slowly and steadily becoming one of the smartest and most talented actors today.One more thing that makes this experience unforgettable is the music. I've mentioned before that this is a film made with passion, and nothing can give voice to passion as much as music does. I will not talk about the brilliant choices of songs and the perfect song-scene synchronization because that will only make sense when you watch the film.Demolition will leave you miserably heavy-hearted but spiritually elevated beyond words.I give it 10 out of 10",Demolition
62,LiquidPoetry1921,A tragic look at loss,7,19 March 2017,"Grief manifests itself in many different ways. In 'Demolition', investment banker Davis Mitchell (Jake Gyllenhaal) 'deals' with that grief by destroying everything in his path ~ from relationships to structures.Unable to deal with the death of his wife Karen (Naomi Watts), who was killed in a car wreck which he was also a passenger, Davis destroys anything that conveys beauty to him, or brings anyone joy.Although I thought the movie was quite poignant and touching, I thought too much of the story focused on him destroying or dismantling things. I understood his grief needed to be conveyed, but after he took apart the refrigerator, and a bathroom stall, and a cappuccino maker, and a home due for demolition, did he really need to take a bulldozer to his home in the middle of the day (to which, comically, none of his neighbors called the police to report). Yes, I understand the name of the movie was 'Demolition', but it was a honestly a little TOO much.But, for the genuine sadness 'Demolition' was able to convey, and the excellent acting, gave the film 7* out of 1o.",Demolition

64,brutzel,Goofy Antics vs Grief,7,17 August 2016,"Davis Mitchell (Gyllenhaal) is a successful investment banker whose wife Julia ((Heather Lind) is seriously hurt in a car accident. Davis doesn't grieve in a usual way. At the hospital when he learns that his wife did pass he tries to get candy from a vending machine and the candy is held up. This causes Davis to write to the vending machine company, but he provides too much information about his life. Customer Assistance rep Karen Moreno (Naomi Watts) reads his letters and feels his pain. Davis follows the advice his boss Phil (Chris Cooper) gives him: in order to set things right one has to take things apart and put them back together. It all starts with Davis taking apart the refrigerator that leaks (his wife kept telling him) and goes on from there: a coffee machine, his computer, lamps and so on. With the help of Karen and her son Chris (Judah Lewis) can he demolish his old life put his new life back together? After the funeral this becomes goofy with Davis taking all electronics apart and the reason it's goofy is because we never see him put anything back together. When he meets Karen we see him imagining his wife Julia in various instances: we learn that while he never paid much attention to her in life, he is now paying that attention to her now that she is gone. (Is he learning to grieve?)Davis has a good and clever conversation with Karen's son Chris who uses the F-words too often and Davis tells him he is mis-using the F-word. There is an irregular conversation between Chris and Davis when Chris asks Davis if he thinks he is gay.There are highly irresponsible and very uncomfortable scenes when Davis puts on a bullet proof vest and has Chris fire a hand gun into it. Why these scenes are in here make no sense. A bond was previously established between them. See?And there are scenes where Davis has Chris help him destroy his house and as he says: his marriage. If you watch on a DVD, be prepared for very loud Rock & Roll music when we see Chris listen to his music so keep the remote handy. The acting all around is excellent and I wish Chris Cooper would somehow get a script whereby he has a chance to win another Oscar as his acting all the time is pure gold. It is said all of us have different ways of grieving and will Davis' goofy ways turn into real grief. Inquiring minds are hopeful. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.",Demolition
65,dissident320,Dealing with grief,8,17 June 2017,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Opens with a car crash that takes the life of Jake Gyllenhaal's character's wife. From there this movie swung in a different direction than I thought. For me it seems to be about how someone deals with grief. Everyone around his character wants/expects him to be acting in a certain way. His wife's death has changed his outlook on life and those around him eventually become less comfortable with his behaviour. I really enjoyed Jake's performance. His character is weird (Not Nightcrawler weird), funny, angry and ultimately just figuring out how to grieve. For a movie I was expecting to lean into the sentimentality it played out in a different way that I feel is a bit more true to real life. It didn't win him any awards but I think the acting in this places it as one of the better movies Jake has done.",Demolition
66,ejonconrad,Great acting almost saves a contrived plot and ham handed symbolism,5,11 July 2017,"People deal with grief in many ways, but it's hard to believe it would turn someone into a self-centered, unhinged lunatic. And if he did fall that far, it's unlikely that he would snap right back after few convenient plot turns. To Jake Gyllenhaal's credit, he *almost* makes it believable.He plays an investment banker whose wife is killed in a car accident in the first few minutes of the movie. This causes him to question the priorities in his life, alienate everyone around him, and begin to develop a fascination with taking things apart - or just straight up breaking them (ouch! someone just hit me in the head with a blunt metaphor).Through a genuinely original plot device, he starts a relationship with Naomi Watts. She's got her own baggage. Among other things, she has a very troubled teen son, whom she largely ignores, so he has plenty of time to spend with the clearly unstable man she has just welcomed into their lives. Again, Watts is a good enough actress that you kind of forget the fact her character isn't going to win mother of the year.The plot develops through a series of turns and revelations that are all just a bit to neat and contrived. It's not formulaic by any means, but there's never any doubt where it's headed.Chris Cooper turns in his usual great performance as the father of Gyllenhaal's dead wife. He also has the advantage of playing the only character who's behavior seems reasonable.All in all, the movie had a interesting and original premise, but the writer was just a little to impressed with himself.",Demolition
67,ztigr,No not real,5,11 October 2016,"So this movie has some fine acting, and the emotions ring true in most cases. The young widower who isn't sure if he was in love, the devastated father, and the mother that had the complicated mother- daughter relationship. However, I felt the demolition of the house was way over the top and added little to the story. The main character had already shown some of this obsessive demolition behavior previously I didn't need to be force fed more in case I found his actions too subtle. The entire relationship with Naomi Watts was convoluted. The way they met became little more than a plot device as the very communication of the letters that brought them together was lacking in their real friendship. In fact they had little reason to remain connected for the time they did other than the fact that they were both depressed and had unresolved issues. The audience is set up to think their relationship would be a central piece of the story, whether it turned romantic or just remained a friendship, but it served little purpose other than to add a B and C plot to the film. The main character's relationship with the son Chris had more realistic moments than any interaction with Naomi Watts character. And at the end of the movie it appears that Jake G's character has not even continued with the relationships other than to write a letter to Chris. So its a watchable movie and it wants to say something, but it can't pull it off in the end. This is due to what might have become interesting story directions basically becoming plot gimmicks in an attempt to add elements to the story in a new clever way. But the payoff of these gimmicks is just not there and detracts from the narrative.",Demolition

I am speechless right now after seeing the movie and his acting just swept me off my feet. Every little detail, every little expression is so minutely captured by the director that it amazes me to see what Jake is capable of.From an extremely personal experience I have gone through this journey in my life and I found it very relatable. I had to cut off two stars because Davies Mitchell didn't face any consequence for the actions he was doing, like making a kid fire a hand-gun or just taking down his house without permission of any sorts. It looked a bit too Hollywood-y. Actions like that always have consequence.

75,yourfavoritecritic,An Otherwise Great Film Bogged Down by a Cluttered Ending,8,2 November 2020,"Demolition tells the story of Davis Mitchell, a successful business man, dealing with the loss of his wife. This film is directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, who is best known for directing 2013's Dallas Buyer's Club and 2014's Wild both of which received high critical acclaim. Demolition stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Naomi Watts and Christ Cooper. This was a film I was eagerly anticipating as from the trailer, Demolition, looked to be something special and Jake Gyllenhaal has been on fire as of late. His past five or so movies have been excellent, apart from Southpaw, which I found to be aggressively average, but he was still good in it. So Demolition plays out very slow, with the film mostly being a character study about a way in which someone may deal with a significant loss and I felt that to be particularly engrossing, especially due to Jake's performance. All the acting in this film is fantastic, with Jake Gyllenhaal and Judah Lewis taking the forefront due to their unlikely bond. The film is filled with snippy dialogue and is excellently written. However as the film reaches a head, it sort of relies too heavily on some plot twist and just goes all out bonkers, leaving me to question exactly why some things had to happen. If the film would have left the revelation that happened to Davis as the only plot twist, the ending would have faired a lot better. It just felt as if the writer thought in order to make Demolition a good movie, he'd have to throw even more curve balls in there and hammer the audience over the head with symbolism and motifs. However the movie was great to begin with and its mess of an ending really held the final product back. I did enjoy the movie a lot, though I found it slow and probably won't get too many watches out of it, I do highly recommend this film, Demolitions gets an 8.5/10.",Demolition
76,huntersmithx,"A confused, disturbed and reprehensible jumble.",5,6 May 2019,"2016 had much to offer in terms of great films, in spite of some mediocre efforts too. None of the lesser movies that I watched (like ""The Legend of Tarzan"") compared to the disasterous film that is ""Demolition"" (no pun intended). As a proud supporter of Independent Cinema, and the film's talented cast which includes Jake Gyllenhaal and Naomi Watts; I was eager to give this a watch.Sadly, I was disappointed. Setting aside that many of the story ideas have been done better in the past, namely ""Three Colors: Blue""; this is a confused, disturbed and reprehensible jumble that skews all of it's good intentions. This is especially bizzare coming from a director like Jean-Marc Vallèe (of ""Dallas Buyers Club"" fame).Jake Gyllenhaal plays Davis Mitchell, an investment banker, who after losing his wife in a car accident, begins to re-evaluate his life and seeks new meaning. His journey is also awoken by meeting Karen Moreno (Naomi Watts), and eventually her troubled son, through some strange circumstances.The premise and serious set-up for the film would make you want to root for Davis as a likable protagonist. Is that the case here? No, no, no. As the story progresses; he flip flops between likable everyman, mouthy weirdo then creepy and mentally disturbed. Why this? Scenes including something as out of nowhere as him fantasizing about shooting at people in an airport. He also stops a train over something miniscule (he's then let off freely by authorities because his wife recently passed, what?). He dismantles property in his workplace, then he later shoots Karen's son Chris as he wears a bulletproof vest. He also makes creepy comments to Chris as he (Chris) questions his sexuality. Davis later disrupts an interview in his workplace and makes a joke about how people urinate in the YMCA swimming pools (although it's funny out of context). He also literally demolishes most of his own home. Anti-Heroes can be done great in movies, but the level of inconsistency with Davis here makes Walt Kowalski from ""Gran Torino"" look like Luke Skywalker in comparison.Many great movies don't have to be completely subtle to get their themes across, but here it's done badly. The messages are pounded like a crowbar to the skull; such as literal metaphors about dissecting things such as Grandfather Clocks and putting them back together, and again- Chris demolishing his own home.This is all topped off with a strange plot twist towards the end of the film, and a rushed ending that made me question if it was all worth it.While it's certainly not one of the worst movies ever made, it's one of the worst disappointing movies I've ever seen. In a way; I feel bad about ripping this movie apart, because I realIy wanted to like it. In spite of the best acting from it's cast, good direction and editing; they're all in favor of a colossal mess.

If the answer is yes, you've found your movie. This has been working wonders for me for the last 10 plus years. The man knows how to choose a film and ""Demolition"" isn't a let down. Gyllenhaal plays Davis Mitchell, a man experiencing self deconstruction as he demolishes his life bit by bit. It's a fascinating look at how we experience loss, pain and self reflection. About how we run from truth and let ourselves lose the little things that make us experience joy and happiness. Gyllenhaal is amazing at showing a cold uncaring exterior and slowly unleashing the boiled over emotion that's completely engulfed him. He's not alone, he's surrounded with such a great group of actors all standing in for different types of grief and the ways we handle it. Chris Cooper and Naomi Watts are both fantastic, but its Judah Lewis (The Babysitter) who steals his scenes with Gyllenhaal as the two build an unlikely friendship through destruction. The movie is also technically beautiful with a perfect use of color and light to capture emotion. Jean-Marc Vallée is such an impressive director who always shows such perfectly framed meaningful shots and he always knows how and when to capture quiet emotion from his actors. He's one of those people that when you see his name you know you're in for something special.

If you enjoyed Jake in Nightcrawler and Donnie Darko, I think this movie will also be very enjoyable for you. It had a similar soundtrack as Nightcrawler (the music is good at helping carry over the emotions of the characters and the direction of the story).The story is distinctly different from anything like Nightcrawler or Donnie Darko, but it has the same dark feel to it.

Jake Gyllenhaal does it again!Being a fan of this brilliant actor, I (try to) watch almost all of his movies. New and old. I saw the IMDb page of this movie months before it released. It had a poster with Jake Gyllenhaal holding a hammer against a wall he was breaking down. I instantly added it to my watchlist.Now, months later, even right now, the rating for this movie is really low. Like, it's 7, which is average, but the number of votes? Only around 30k? That's a real shame. I almost didn't want to watch this movie because of the same reason. But I knew I was going to anyway (someday), because I'm a fan of Mr. Gyllenhaal. :DAnd this movie really did it for me. I really, really liked it. At first, the detached character of Jake really felt repulsive, if I must say. I mean, his wife died and he was acting like it was nothing. But as the movie progressed we saw him go through the grief of the same, in his own way. And I could understand and sympathize with his feelings and emotions. And by the end, even I was in tears (almost). Now, that is some mind blowing character development.There's some really great dialogue in this movie.""If you wanna fix something, you have to take everything apart, and figure out what's important; what'll make you stronger. Repairing the human heart is like repairing an automobile. Just examine everything. Then you can put it all back together.""Simply amazing.I also really liked the entire take of Jake on the usage of the ""F"" word. To be honest, I think what he said seemed really accurate. Too much usage of the word and repeatedly saying it does discredit the word's actual meaning, and what it is meant for. I think I should tone down my usage of the same too, now. :DAnd the visuals? Stunning! The editing and the cinematography of this movie is no less. I LOVED a few shots. Especially that one scene where he is walking in the crowd, while the crowd walks backwards. I have seen such scenes many times in different movies, but I still loved. Not only that but the scenes where Davis (Jake's character) imagines the shadow of his wife behind him are also done beautifully.Putting all of these marvelous things aside, I also adored the various subtle feelings, actions and changes they showed to us as the movie progressed. That's the thing about a good drama (with good acting), you don't need words to express every little thing; every little feeling. For example, Davis (Jake's character) in a way, changed Karen (Naomi Watt's character). Now, this isn't blatantly expressed because the movie doesn't revolve around her character, but it is implied.Remember that little scene where she separates her undergarments and her socks, all because earlier in the movie Jake said, ""I just think a woman's underwear is deserving of its own space.""Tiny details like these can only be noticed when someone pays attention and is invested in watching the movie. Such subtleties, otherwise, usually go unnoticed and hence unappreciated. I, on the other hand, really admire when they imply stuff rather than saying it explicitly in movies; when they don't speak EVERY thing they feel, but still we can see what they feel in every little thing they do, if we notice.I think I might re-watch the movie just because I want to see if I missed any detail. Also, because the movie IS that good.And trust me, I'm not being partial when I say that, Jake REALLY DID more than enough justice to his character.Also, I forgot to mention, the score for this movie is amazing. It really set the mood. I don't know who is responsible for the same, but hats off to you sir/mam.I really wish this movie would get more recognition. It's a beautifully done movie and it can be heartbreaking sometimes. The movie is virtually flawless and darn near perfect.9/10A must watch. Don't miss this one.",Demolition

Regardless, even in playing a more traditional character, the actor fully committed to the role over the film's mere 30-day shoot. The drama is weakened by the comedy and the comedy is weakened by the drama, and the whole tone is made more confusing as a result, but in a handful of scenes the terrific cast is able to click with each other as well as the competing tones.

Follows the ""You don't know what you got till it's gone"" saying but it's more along the lines of ""You don't see what you were missing until it's all gone."" It's hard for me to describe it in a simple way but that's it in a nutshell as best as I can.The film's main focus is on Davis(Gyllenhaal) dealing with grief in a way that you don't really see in other movies and he does so in a perfect way. He is one of the best actor's we have right now and this movie is not an exception. The scenes where he breaks down just slightly are perfect and really show the range of emotions he so effortlessly displays.Now the things that make the movie not so great: Naomi Watts. I normally like the characters she plays but jeez, is there something wrong with her in this one? I understand that she's playing a weird character and it's not really her that I have a problem with. It's the fact that she's even included in the story. There's actually quite a few things not necessary in the movie and I feel that is what holds it back.Overall it's a great showcase of Gyllenhaal's acting abilities and proves he can tackle any role.

91,mickgmovies,Emotional Escapism,8,8 July 2016,"Jake Gyllenhaal is fantastic in this movie, as Davis, an emotionally detached husband, who has to navigate the sudden death of his wife.It's a movie that explores a journey of emotion, and how Davis deals with it in his own unique way. By slowly and literally deconstructing the life he had with his wife, until he finds an ember that allow his true emotions to be properly fueled - and ultimately to escape.I suppose the reason I enjoyed this movie is that we can all feel emotionally numb at times in our lives - whether it be due to the drudgery of everyday life, the boredom of routine, the familiarity of our surrounds. And how a 'pattern interrupt' in this case a rather extreme one (of a death), can disrupt and challenge us back to 'life'. The movie reminded me that it's not necessary for things to have to break, to make us grateful for what we have. And to challenge ourselves to live life fully and in the present.We all need more emotional escape in our lives - and this movie certainly provided that for me.",Demolition

98,annaily,"A poignant and compelling story of pain, vulnerability, and human connection",9,16 September 2017,"I really loved this movie. A whole lot. Wow. The story really resonated with me.The movie follows the connections shared by Davis with Karen, and Davis with Karen's son Chris, as well as other characters, as they take apart their own lives, demolishing their pain, and building a new life together. We get a glimpse into the pain experienced by people that can be healed through destroying the past, rebuilding for the future, and connecting with others.Every character is multi-dimensional, experiencing inner turmoil, struggling in their own ways. Even the deceased character (no spoiler, but it's pretty obvious who unless you know nothing about the movie) is multi dimensional and we learn about her own struggles.Physical pain vs emotional pain, and physical possessions vs personal connections are large themes of the movie. The ability to feel feelings, to control them, and the joy that comes once you feel free to release them. Sometimes you need to destroy and take everything apart to fix it.There are moments of raw human emotion and vulnerability, laughter, regret and grief, childlike connection, painful isolation and loneliness, forgiveness and sorrow. It's truly an astounding experience. I laughed and cried and felt this movie was written about my own life.I found it breathtaking seeing pain and comfort in this way. How two people who are complete strangers can have an immediate connection, one that is very unique and deeper compared to relationships characters spent years building. This story may not be for everyone, but I found it shockingly compelling, poignant, and relatable.",Demolition
99,jwvandegronden-1,"Devistating loneliness in grief, and the guts it takes to embrace that suffocating emptiness",8,12 January 2021,"The movie averages out at a 7, which I think is underrated. The most profound feeling I get from this movie, thanks to the (of course) magnificent acting of Jake Gyllenhaal, is the loneliness grief enforces on you. The main character has no idea what hit him, and only at the end he realizes how the pieces fit together, for him, for his love for his wife, for his guilt, his emotional desolation and inability to find the beginning strand of his emotional fabric, and only at the end he is able to fully unravel his emotions, giving him room to breath, honor the people wjho earleir seemed to be obstructing him, while they themselves had their own isolated grief to wade trough to the other end. And they all had enough screen time to share their process of grief, the layers and mutual expectations and projections, and the magnifying effect it had on their pain, being confronted with the others' mutually incomprehensible ways of dealing with that terrible loss.It is hard to describe, but having gone through a devastating loss myself, (Quote in the movie: ""what do you call a parent who lost a child? There is no word for that... "" Heartbreaking and overwhelmingly true) there is not one moment in the movie that felt convoluted, it never lost track of the path it was on despite all the different character developments, it never rang false or overreaching, never artificially trying to tear-jerk its' way out of a profound moment. It was honest, funny as hell the way only grief can make you feel, like a bipolar disorder taking over your personality. Everything had its' place, nothing felt fabricated and all the characters had one or more reasons to be there, to tell their story throughout the movie.I didnt give it a 9 because of the ending, which was beautiful, but slightly too American for my taste. Not the bit where he finally could share his grief with his father in law, that was Jake at his best in the movie, but the few minutes to wrap up the movie. Don't worry, you will easilly survive, and it reaches back to a strand earlier in the movie, so it fits the purpose well. Just a little too much sugar. Still easilly an 8, without breaking a sweat!

100,geraldohanna,Gyllenhaal muddle's through his own version of American Beauty.,6,23 June 2016,"After the unexpected loss of his wife (Heather Lind, ""Turn"") Davis (Jake Gyllenhaal, ""Nightcrawler"") a successful investment banker tries to understand the nature of his grief while unraveling dangerously, especially to those around him. He befriends Karen (Naomi Watts, ""While We're Young"") a customer service rep. whose own personal problems strike a cord with Davis and her son (Judah Lewis) At first glance, one might find Demolition to be a film based on a real-life thesis, a guide to loss and seeking self-help in a time of awareness. With an intriguing premise and an engaging cast and director, this should have been and could have very well been all of those things - Except it's not, although it will try heavily to make you think through all its profundity and idealism that it is all of these things. At its core, screenwriter Bryan Sipe gives us enough meat to swallow in fear of us choking on whatever truths he feels we can't handle. The story is driven rather fast with enough dramatic tension to fill its runtime. Gyllenhaal whose previous credits include (""South Paw"") understands Davis and embodies him both physically and mentally never truly picking a mood to land on. His emotions and mental state are constantly unraveling as he desperately tries to feel and understand the world he thought he once knew. Gyllenhaal and Sipe play this tone well without Davis coming off as mentally unbalanced. Watts, adds charm and likability to her minor role, a role that although any actress could have portrayed - Watts understands inner turmoil and regret. And she shows us that within each scene she's in. Newcomer Judah Lewis is truly the star of this film besting wits with Gyllenhaal, while also trying to understand what it means to be homosexual at a young age. Cinematographer Yves Bélanger also deserves credit for an eloquent and melancholic scenery for when Davis is sad; and a vibrant and loud scenery for when happy. Director, Jean-Marc Vallée (""Wild"") guides his cast as if it were a ballad being played slowly and cautiously. Unlike his previous film, Demolition tries to reach higher than it needs too, while asking questions that we are ourselves have probably never had the time to think on. But that's all it does, ask questions and ask questions, and expect us to answer them with some sort of resolution on what the film was trying to say. American Beauty had Kevin Spacey trying to understand the meaning of his life and what it was worth - Demolition has Gyllenhaal trying to find a climax worth understanding.",Demolition

Now you can make a great film with that premise, such as ""About Schmidt"" (wich by the way, is kind of the same story) or ""Taxi Driver"" or you can a make a mediocre and kind of pretentious film like this.

103,geoced,Gyllenhaal is perfect !,7,8 April 2016,"I went to see this movie without really knowing its pitch or genre. Increasingly, I feel this is the best way to enjoy a feature film, as trailers reveal more and more of the story, going as far as basically spoiling major plot points and leaving nothing to the imagination. A movie trailer should reveal as little as possible but still tease your interest. Good trailers are works of art in their own right : they have their own story and may even use footage that won't appear in the finished movie.Anyway, all I knew about ""Demolition"" was that it tells the story of a guy who has to cope with the loss of his wife and, because of that title, I supposed that he was going to loose his mind and that his life was slowly going to spiral out of control. Kind of like 1993's ""Falling Down"" with Michael Douglas.While it is true that there is a fair bit of demolition (literally) and quirkiness involved, ultimately this movie is about a man deconstructing his life, demolishing his prejudices in order to find his true self. Once again, Gyllenhaal truly inhabits his character and delivers a remarkable performance, almost as good as his Oscar-worthy role in ""Nightcrawler"" (which was inexplicably snubbed by the Academy). Gyllenhaal is slowly becoming one of the most talented actors in Hollywood these days! Although the rest of the cast is quite good -- especially the young Judah Lewis -- I'm not sure this film would have worked without him.All in all, a strange yet interesting film. 7 out of 10.",Demolition

107,hearthstoneivan,Grief seen through a quirky lens,8,29 December 2017,"7.5/10 Watching Demolition felt like being spoon-fed caviar. The one who feeds you expects both appreciation of its fine taste and a complete lack of skills regarding the use of silverware. While all that caviar is still appetizing, it would be a lot better if you didn't hear a ""Choo Choo, open your mouth!"" whenever the ordeuver is tasted. As ever Gyllenhall has been fantastic playing a grieving quirky character, whose letters serve both as therapy and exposition devices for the audience. Naomi Watts is a bit underused, as a melanchonicly calm woman with a redneck husband and a rebellious kid. The journey is tight and collected, opposed to the behavior of these individuals whose story we follow. Everyone talks in an odd, overexplainable manner, which kind of bothered me throughout. As Gyllenhalls character says: ""Everything has become a metaphor"", you feel spoiled with all this unnecessary commentary of things meant to be subtle. We all know that him destroying his house, acting sporadically and delving into small issues isn't just a random eccentricity, but an allegory for his suffering. Speaking of suffering, Judah Lewis convincingly plays a teenage brat with an internal conflict of his own. Seeing a great kid actor nowadays is always a breath of fresh air.Conclusion: 
Demolition explores themes that have the need to be explored, though not with a sledgehammer and a hunting knife. It's short, tight and persuasively watchable, despite so on-the-nose. Worth watching for the great performances and the wonderful character interactions.",Demolition

No. Although the movie gets into interesting thoughts, like being straight or not, loving the one you lost, is original in a way, it in fact gets nowhere. It is boring. Too much complications for a simple thing. What did the lost person meant really for you? You go on discovery, think about the person you are, make new encounters, and put everything in doubt. OK! But there is no passion in this. Nowhere that makes you wonder what will happen next. It is weird and you not understand where this is going. And at the end all is simple. No revelations, nothing that makes you think it was worth watching. I love art-house movies. When I was young went into small theaters, where the screen was smaller then what I have at home now.

This is no mean feat for an actor with such a tragic story line and he pulls it off brilliantly.I would however of liked the mental health issues that surround the process of grief further explored and a stronger message to go out to the audience that grief manifests in so many individual ways that you are never wrong with the way you feel...Its a very precious and intimate individual process.Naomi Watts character is a little bizarre and almost unnecessary in my view but I will not spoil anything here.A good just under two hours spent in my opinion with a a lot of thinking to continue for the rest of the evening.

120,halsall-07142,Everything is a metaphor.,5,7 May 2016,"Director Jean-Marc Vallée has built up an impressive filmography in the past twenty years and his last two features, Dallas Buyers Club and Wild, have propelled Vallée forward as one of the most exciting film-makers of this decade. Now collaborating with the equally impressive Jake Gyllenhaal in Demolition, the script for which appeared on the Hollywood Blacklist in 2007, Vallée explores the concept of grieving for lost loved ones, what people mean too each other and metaphors, lots of metaphors.Davis (Gyllenhaal) is a successful investment banker under the employ of Phil (Chris Cooper), the father of his wife Julia (Heather Lind). When Julia is killed in a car crash Davis struggles to cope with the grief/or lack thereof and, having been unable to purchase some candy the night of his wife's death, begins to write a series of complaints to a vending machine company which develop into a personal exertion of his feelings and moods. Unknown to him the letters are being read by Karen (Naomi Watts) a customer service representative with emotional burdens of her own.As terrific as Gyllenhaal continues to be in Demolition the film is weighed down by a frankly outrageously self-aware quirkiness. Dialogue can be a wonderfully expressive and ingenious tool but here it is overladen with self-importance and pretentiousness as some of the lines delivered by the actors, Watts in particular, just made sections of the audience laugh at how self-aggrandising they seemed. None of the characters feel real and for a film obsessed with truth this veneer of characterisation just makes the eccentricity of the characters seem like desperate attempts to create interesting drama. The second act was a particularly weighty sequence of bizarrely quirky dialogue interchanges and a couple of amusingly shallow montage sequences that leave Demolition a sourly disappointing affair. However in the final act there is a sudden surge of development as Davis begins to dismantle his life we start to see past the babbling posturing of the characters and begin to see some of the truth that Demolition seems to be so obsessed with. Vallée explores how objects truly define us within a relationship and how through taking his life apart Davis is able to see through the definitions of marriage, remembrance, forgiveness and grief to learn and experience them beyond the level of expectancy. Chris Cooper is one of the most reliable character actors going and his measured performance as the grieving Phil is an empathic turn from a great performer, Whilst Naomi Watts is left somewhat desolate as a presence thanks to some rather ungraceful dialogue despite her best efforts.Whilst at times infuriating it was somewhat rewarding to see Demolition manage to construe its ideas into something relatable. Hitting us in the proverbial face with a dazzlingly vast array of metaphorical dialogue didn't provoke thought or feeling, but the actions of the latter part of Demolition do create a satisfying resolution. After you wade through the unimportance of all the philosophical nonsense and discover what the film uncovers about the manufacture, and deconstruction, of our relationships then it's definitely got some qualities that make it worth checking out. Just try not to laugh too hard when Davis announces his realisation that ""Everything is a metaphor"".Review by Alexander Halsall.

Following his passage of grief we learn a lot about him and his emotions towards his wife. Gyllenhaal does a phenomenal job, I consider myself a fan of everything he's done but here he brings alive a character that's hard to sum up on paper, a man lost in a state of being so foreign to him. Other than Gyllenhaal's performance the film follows a lot of predictable points, a few walking cliché characters and a hell of a lot of letter writing. Nothing unbearable, just a little bit too on the nose. Although the editing is very commendable and felt different to the usual expectation, although it does make the film seem slightly too fragmented at points in which more clarity would have helped.

129,MeBeiM,A pretty strange experience,6,23 September 2016,"I saw the trailer for this movie, and I thought: why not? Looks interesting. Jake Gyllenhaal is a very good actor in my honest opinion, he really suits this kind of role, and I liked the idea of the man who loses the wife and starts going almost crazy, realizing that his life has to change or something like that. I've seen this kind of plot more than one time, and it looked promising. I actually really liked the movie in the beginning, but, as the plot developed (if one can say so), it left me with a pretty strange feeling. Davis' wife dies, and he doesn't even drop a tear, because he didn't love her; instead, he starts disassembling or demolishing almost anything he comes across, taking his father in law's advice a bit too literally. His wife didn't mean much to him, but her disappearance still caused such a deep change in David's life. It's when he meets Karen and her son that I began thinking they would have eventually gotten together or something, but nothing serious happens. Davis changes behavior radically, starts hanging out with Karen's son and keeps disassembling and destroying things, getting to the point of destroying his own house (I didn't really get why).As the movie goes on, I'm left with a sensation of emptiness and the desire for something real to happen, but it actually never does. Karen looked very happy with Davis, and so did Chris, but they just separate without an actual reason. Did Davis quit his job? Did he move or did he keep on living in his half demolished house? Did Karen leave Carl? Will Davis and Karen ever see each other again? Did something concrete actually happen in the whole movie, except maybe for the merry-go- round built by Karen's dad with the money of her insurance? Even the poor guy who follows Davis in a station wagon and finally reveals himself saying he was driving the car which caused the accident doesn't actually contribute to the plot in any way. I don't really know what to think about this movie, because it looks like it is incomplete.I really liked the acting, specially from Gyllenhaal, and the idea wasn't bad at all, but it needed something more. This movie is really thought provoking, and will make you think and think even after you exit the cinema or turn off your TV, but there isn't much more which adds value to it.",Demolition

I just wanted to see another Jake Gyllenhaal movie because in my opinion he never gets the credit he deserves. It was barely 20 minutes into the film when I saw those instant flashbacks and noticed Jean-Marc Valle was the director. At that moment, I knew I was in for a treat. This isn't everyone's movie, but it's definitely a movie everyone should watch. After he lose his wife in a tragic car accident, Davis (Jake Gyllenhaal) starts to take apart the broken items in his life, literally, as he begins to recognize the show he's put on for people for years-his wife, his in-laws, but importantly, himself. Along the way, he develops a unique relationship with a burned out customer service rep (Naomi Watts) and her teenage son. And as you're watching the events of the story unfold, you begin to ask yourself all kinds of questions. Questions that can only be answered if you've been paying close intention to the subtleties of each scene. It's a lot to absorb. Then you're left wondering what this movie is really about.

But what comes after the next hour is something that i never saw coming. I am not a big fan of romance movies or things of that sort as i find them unnecessarily cheesy n synthetic. this movie i watched only because of Jake & he didn't disappoint. The take of the movie on the matter & life at hand is something i found profound. This movie goes in to places inside u that u didn't expect, connects to you on a plane that you didn't thing of, every loss, every heartbreak , every unsaid word of appreciation, the daily hardships of relationships, trust, keeping on keep going on, the numbness, the loneliness , you name it... this movie touches everything with a fresh breath. The acting is spot on, Jake & Chris are both amazing in their roles and the torments that comes with it. The best part of the movie which i liked , was it didn't have a motto, it was just it, the span of life everyone on us goes through after a loss .... and had no cheesy moments to make it look profound n amazing. The venting out of emotions is something everyone can relate to ,n i think if we could do ( like breaking stuff either for helping or just for breaking) we would all do the same.It was so simple yet so insane, the mixture of the two worked for me. loved it",Demolition

135,gerald-847-134595,A Movie About Men Feeling,9,13 January 2017,"I thought this was a brilliant movie. Jake Gyllenhaal, as Davis Mitchell, gives a tour de force performance as a man who suddenly loses his wife. Davis is a man out of touch with his feelings and with only a primitive grasp of the underlying dynamics of relationships. Men, in my experience, can often be unclear about what they're feeling. Often our emotional vocabulary is inadequate for circumstances in which we find ourselves. In Demolition Gyllenhaal's character, Davis, is overwhelmed with feelings he has no conception of how to express or deal with.The devastation of his loss forces him to wake up to what is most essential in human existence, our relationships with each other. He'd just been inhabiting roles previously. Is that a spoiler? OK, I'm a therapist and a carpenter, so the idea of taking things all apart to put them back together has immediate resonance. Though I did not lose my wife to breast cancer a couple of years ago, the experience forced me to contemplate the loss. That experience certainly added depth to my experience of the picture.Well, I thought that the way the script, the direction, and the acting portrayed his metamorphosis into a more whole human being was fascinating and beautiful. Naomi Watts is excellent as Karen, the catalyst for his transformation, as is Judah Lewis as her son. Gyllenhaal was perfect and inhabited the part with power and sensitivity. I think it's a great picture.",Demolition
136,jeslynxie724,Cast off Your Chains,9,6 August 2016,"It is a story about return.The whole film was with the story line of Davis. Had been bonded by tedious marriage life, as well as been under the pressure from work and father-in-law, to Davis it looks like a huge relief after losing his wife. He started acting weird, getting curious about every single subject he could see, talking to strangers. He seemingly opened himself to the world that he used to try to hide from, everything is so new and fresh to him. Physically, he ""demolished"" washroom, his office, others' and even his own houses. He was too egotistic to grieve.However, it's not a real relief. Although Davis was like a rebellious kid who celebrates while mom is away from home -- in this case, a close life partner has gone away from his life, soon he realized it was not like that. Knowing that Julia had been cheated on him, Davis also started to remember all the little parts and times they had spent together. Until they, he's back, not to celebrate, but to the real ground. You don't have to make big changes, just need to give out more cares.For Karen's story, it's about getting out of the relationship that she doesn't enjoy.Karen's son's part came along with Davis's line. He's in the teenager state where the self-cognition is being built upon, he's part is about finding the true-self.Jake's movies are always so touchable and inspired, and yet all characters that he has acted are so different. You can't find any similar characteristics from one character in his other movies. Like this one, Davis, his childish actions in the first half part were being perfectly expressed by Jake, you can't even believe this is the person who just acted a boxer full of mankind (Southpaw) and a greedy fox lives in the bottom of society (Nightcrawler).",Demolition

That's how I feel about Demolition. Plus, I've never voted for a 10/10.Jake Gyllenhaal steals the show, once more. His performance astounds me in every single movie, and just when I thought, oh this may be the first movie I'll watch where he'll disappoint; he does the opposite. I also think that the trailer is way less exciting than the movie. This story is so honest, refreshing, naked, thrilling, and yet dreamy at the same time. Most of the movie I was sort jealous of them, of the way they are dealing with life. It's disturbing and quite wacky to be honest, but still.

In demolition David loses his wife and comes to the realization that he really never loved her and is taking her absence as a chance to really take a look at the world and finds himself full of curiosity. So much raw emotion goes into this film but throughout the whole movie you feel that something is missing, except for the end which I feel came together very well. Though there were a few parts that were unnecessary and pointless. As much as I loved the main character I didn't love the story the same. It just didn't feel like it had much purpose and could have been a lot more powerful. It did have it's moments and the comedic lines were fun to see alongside the rock and roll filled soundtrack, but as far as story telling I would give it a 5/10.

144,kewltodamax,Demolition brings home melodrama down to earth,9,23 June 2016,"Demolition is first and foremost a drama, its intended purpose a melodrama. Not so different from the likes of 'Her', 'Mr. Robot', 'Dexter'. However, its approach is towards the now professional ground, from doctors, lawyers, politicians, investment bankers...the story is the same, there is a gloaming melancholy to the portrayal and projection of the male mind...one that is so stripped of their emotion due to their profession, the more they evade it, the more pervasive it becomes.In that aspect, Jake Gyllenhaal was the perfect match for this kind of projection bringing the head down to earth first, from roots to stalk to leaves, slowly blooming each emotion as it floods back. It is true, Mr. Gyllenhaal's facial features may appear as if a zombie puked on it but that's his genetic feature, however what he makes up for its cracking that facial skin and expressing a myriad of different emotions, each one timed to a rhythm that can mix and match. That means less emotions to deal with at the beginning and then more complex as it ends. To me that is the most brilliant tactic in using an actor to its perfection.Its hard for males to see this at a lofty place, they can't accept males to be so emotional about something that seems petty but when you've got nothing to lose, what is petty? For females, well, they can't understand why a man can go so down the path of an emotional sinkhole and be fine with it but the simple answer would but, what would you do to keep an image and comfort for yourself? Aren't all work especially professionalism requires the stripping of some emotion? And how will that play out long term?That's why to me, the story seemed like a happy ending. Davis lost his bearings actually, demolition was a story about 'demolition', destroying his life. All he did in the movie was slowly gonna eat him up later because the entire movie was him in the entire stage of grief. Denial, Anger, Bargaining (With Karen), Depression, Acceptance but he did accept and reached the last stage. That means he got his bearing back, that means now, his back to kid stage one with emotions and professional experience and he'll move forward later on.My only grip, one that I minus one point was inadequate plot lines for that finish touch, it feels a tiny winsy loss in a few plot holes like the ending feels mashed up quick, probably a budget thing but I'd prefer it a little more stylized to plots than image suggestion, it is after all a melodrama. Also the plot didn't feel romantic as much as it is a best friend with/without benefit and I wouldn't catalog that as romance just yet neither were they gay scenes where love was directly projected. This was love from a societal point of view or a global kind of view, a family point of view, and I wouldn't categorize that as romance either...Overall, its a masterpiece to the user end it was directed at. Both those who are slowly losing their emotions and those that have just regained them of those professionals, can relate to this movie in ways that is not only beautiful but endearing.

Jean- Marc Vallée sets the scene with a haphazard, dated Technicolor palette, even in the hospital and contrasts it with the cold tones, shapes and the crispness of Davis' house. The coldness is a kind of veneer or ice that has settled on the main character and the complex stages of reaction to loss that Davis (Gyllenhaal) goes through are the heart of this film.

151,gameoverman49,Demolition Offers A Case Study on Loss and Grieving,7,31 December 2016,"I found Demolition be a hauntingly sad movie that explores grief and how great loss can reshape our perspective. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a frighteningly realistic portrayal of grief, that at several points in his performance had me questioning if his character Davis was going to to ever find a way to make peace with his grief and begin to put his life back together.This film defies genre classification because while it has elements of romance, comedy and drama it also bucks the tropes, norms and trappings of each of those genres. I enjoyed the way the film has Davis taking his life apart physically and psychologically in an effort to identify his feelings, make peace with his grief and come to terms with his life without his wife.My one quibble with the film was the uneven characterization of Naomi Watt's Karen who's introduced into the film in this great supportive role as the film progresses her screen time and story line seem to get lost in the shuffle. Also despite how thought-provoking and touching this movie is I don't see myself re-watching it again as I feel that I have experience all this movie has to offer.Plot Synopsis: The movie Demolition focuses on Davis (the male lead character portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal) working through the grief of suddenly losing his wife. Initially Davis is unable to open to others with his grief; during an attempt to write a letter requesting a refund Davis finds himself compelled to explore his grief through writing. Through his letter writing Davis begins to process his grief and gain some introspective on how much he took his old life with his wife for granted. Through Davis' letters he begins to forge a relationship with Karen (portrayed by Naomi Watts), the customer service representative who has been receiving them. Karen brings Davis into her life and home with her troubled teenage son Chris. As Davis is working through his grief he reaches out to Chris who is struggling with identity issues associated with coming of age. Davis and Chris forge a relationship forged on trust and candid discussions that help both men come to terms with their new place in life. Karen's support and a newly gained sense of purpose and perspective that Davis acquires through helping Chris with his identity issues lead to Davis beginning to pull out of the tailspin his life was in. Davis begins to level off and starts moving forward with his life.",Demolition

I can still feel the pit in my stomach this morning after having watched it last night. And what a wonderful thing to have been made to feel so deeply while watching this character who can't feel a thing for much of the film. I don't know how much was changed from the original script, but it must have been stellar to begin with; a truly original work of art. I could relate and empathize with all of the characters and especially the lead. Jake Gyllenhaal played this role so beautifully. I've gone through a time being that numb, so seeing it played out like that was heart wrenching and yet also uplifting. There are so many times in life when we all just want to lose it so badly, destroy something, take a huge time out from life, just do something to get off this crazy ride for a bit (and so absolutely love the carousel metaphor). And during this film you get the opportunity to live vicariously through this character as he allows himself the freedom to just break, and in the process break the material things around him. Oh, how it would be wonderful to just let loose like that, instead of holding on like we all have to do every day. I loved this movie so deeply, and can't wait to buy a copy when it comes out on DVD.

And like most of his movies, Demolition is also unbelievably strange and hard to predict. In here, his exceptional acting turned a what could be a morbid, sad, depressing plot into an enthralling and beguiling story with different emotions mingled together. It's a profoundly sad story because he isn't sad. The way Davis (Jake) handles his loss and the way how the movie displays destruction is very interesting and what the movie really wants us to see. Destruction can be therapeutic. Many gave this movie low review scores because they thought the human connections and the emotions he was feeling was too unnatural and unrealistic making the film less appealing. But I think the opposite. His wiredness allows him to make eerie relationship and go on to make uncanny decisions. You just have to watch the movie to find out.

However, I am glad that I did!As the title of this comment says, this film is a simplistic account of a complex coping mechanism of a simply complex individual. Loosing someone is not always as dramatic as pictured to be, the real loss is being left behind with questions, confusion and apparent unfinished business, deep down the reason for grieving is for one to move on with life. Yes, different people do grieve differently, but the honesty behind the protagonist's take on life after his loss is easy to relate to for the audience. Easy to relate to not because it is common but rather because its uniquely thought provoking.What starts with a pack of peanut M&Ms stuck in the vending machine, soon becomes apparent to be the protagonist stuck in life.I do agree with the saying that sometimes in order to put something together you need to take it apart, and that is exactly what this film does. The film takes apart relationships, emotions and complexity, while somehow, at the same time, putting together a simple yet beautiful message for their audiences. Sometimes, happiness lies in destruction and the most inconsequential of actions.""Closure"" is a very tricky prospect. ""Stranger"" not always implies negative or a state of permanency.

162,analeemmiranda,"If you have ever experienced grief, you will like this film!",8,28 June 2017,"**Warning, this review contains spoilers** This beautifully acted film takes on the emotion of ""grief"" and goes wild with it. Every character is at a different stage of grief. Grief is a deeply personal emotion. It can come in stages or all at once. For Davis Mitchell (Gyllenhaal), who is just beginning his voyage through the grief process, the process is slow. He has just lost his wife Julia (Lind) and cannot understand why he is so numb. In this state, he questions everything about himself. Is he a monster? Does he know how to do anything? Is he just an empty soulless shell? His old life was lived quickly. He recounts his life using a series of letters to Karen Moreno (Watts), a customer service agent for the company that stocks the candy machines in the hospital. He confesses his sins to her, but really they are his fears. Because he didn't stop and smell the roses, he may have lost the ability to love anyone or anything. He simply followed a series of to-do lists and rarely took the time to enjoy anything. In contrast, Karen feels too much and uses drugs to make her numb. She misses how simple things were, how easy it was to love her son Chris (Lewis) when he was young. Now that he is grown, and facing his own challenges, she can't seem to connect with him or anyone. Her boyfriend Carl (Wilson) thinks she is happy with him, but in reality she's just a good actress. She understands how broken she is and hides it well. That's why she is so drawn to Davis and his grief. He is honest about who he is, he doesn't pretend that he's feeling something when he isn't.Chris starts out being the unruly teenager, too angry to connect with anyone but painfully observant and jaded. His interactions with Davis are comedic and inappropriate at times, but Chris admires Davis' honesty as well. While Davis destroys objects to understand why he is so numb, Chris destroys objects from a place of anger and pain. His pain stems from the fact that he cannot be the person he wants to be. As he questions his sexuality, he admires Davis for being himself. While Chris and Karen look up to Davis, Carl and Julia's parents, Phil (Cooper) and Margot (Draper), are troubled by him. Carl is afraid of losing Karen to Davis. While Phil and Margot are disillusioned by their son-in-law, who was a different person when Julia was alive. They believe that Julia brought out the best in people, including Davis. Now that she is gone, they feel they have lost the version of Davis that they liked. They are frustrated, bewildered and saddened by his choices, including the dismantling of objects that need to be fixed and his new friendship with Karen. Through all of Davis' interactions with these characters full of grief, he slowly lets go of his numbness. The defining moment being when meets and forgives the man who drove the car that crashed into him and Julia. He finally lets his emotions flood in and he cries. He begins to remember the good times with his wife and his happiest moments. That's when he finally realizes that he is indeed capable of love and that he loved Julia. In the film's end, Davis witnesses the demolition of a group of buildings while Chris observes him from afar. Davis is no longer deconstructing himself. He is now living with his grief and simply observing destruction from a distance. He has moved to a different stage of grief, not quite acceptance, but no longer in shock. Chris has also moved on to a different stage. We first met him in the anger stage, but he has finally moved on to acceptance. The film is well-acted and has a good premise but doesn't quite deliver on its message. The core structure is there but I wanted more follow-through. The relationship between Davis and Chris was artfully done, but director Jean-Marc Vallée did not explore the supporting characters very deeply. With the exception of Phil and Karen, the other characters were more props than anything else. They seemed to be a means to an end, which is a great injustice because they were also grieving. While Phil and Karen had more development than the others, they themselves were perfunctory because we didn't really witness them change. I think this was a missed opportunity because they are so important to the love story between Davis and Julia, which is also not fully explored. That said, the superb acting, the wonderful interaction between Davis and Chris, and the honest portrayal of the grief process, makes this film worthy of a view.",Demolition

It can kill a spirit or diminish freedom. I don't know why Davis is the way he is, but his journey is an example of a kind of release and discovery that we should all take in some form. That in itself and the way Gyllenhaal portrays and inhabits this character is worth a nine. I thought it was shot beautifully, flowed well and all the characters were portrayed in a real and unconscious way that is a serious nod to all the actors and the director that brought that out of them. It felt original to me, though some may find it a bit heavy handed or cliché. I enjoyed the film immensely and immediately recommended it to anyone I knew who seeks to understand the human condition, the confines of society and the fight to be true to oneself, honest and free.",Demolition
169,dimjovasevic,It is good movie if Jake Gyllenhaal acting,8,11 August 2016,"I am a big fan of Gyllenhaal's movies, but I watched this movie very objectively. As always, perfect acting of Jake and Naomi, and I am also under impression of Chris Cooper acting full of experience.Some points from movie which I will always remember is picture of man without emotions almost till end of movie after everything change. Davis was covered by the mask of unemotional guy, but sparkling of memories of his wife and Karen, woman he met, and special relationship with his son will change him and through him on right path of life. Davis starts his new life in the moment when he jump out from his routine way of living. That helped him to be very successful in business and to become a rich man, but without living in a real life and enjoying every part of life. He sleeps 2h more for the first time in last 10 years, throw alarm clock in the garbage and starting new life.The crucial moment for Davis is when he meets driver who kill his wife and for the first time he starts to feel empathy. Empathy will change his life , change his habits and help him to survive difficult moment. In my opinion, good movie is movie with deep lesson inside, and when you think about movie so many time after watching. Demolition is definitely that kind of movie.",Demolition

Playing a role with sadistic mind doesn't seem to have lot of scope.

173,Blake4656,Another masterpiece by Gyllenhaal ... He always exceeds my expectations with every new film,9,28 August 2016,"Davis comes off as a somewhat cold, emotionless widower & can't seem to feel a loose other than the $1.25 loose from a vending machine while inside the Hospital. With so many family members morning he excludes himself but instead begins a writing letter escapade for a refund but really pours out some intimate feelings that he thinks is important at the time to claim his case for his refund. A CS Rep reaches out who's touched by his letters & he seems a bit stuck on sharing & knowing this rep who actually read his letters. Shortly prior he move forward with fixing an appliance that was last spoken about seconds before his loose and strangely enough develops a sick obsession with taking things a part with his red-box set of tools simply due to his curiosity of breaking things down and seeing what they look like from inside out & spreading them among the floor.... A metaphor in itself. This once seldom financial investment banker, clean cut, routine driven man finally breaks away from all that he was groomed for and was now all that easy begins what seems like an out of control spiral to most but for him he is finally paying attention to his surroundings rather than doing all that he knows to be easy. Risk taking to most but to him just not thinking and purely acting on his impulses as well as being completely honest throughout each act. A few relationships were created but also some were awkwardly being broken but not to Davis. This became his moment to breakout his inner somewhat goofy fun child which completely transformed his characters perception on screen.. This so called downward spiral of his begins to come to a halt once he discovered was hidden information as well an introduction of the conspicuous driver of that damn old Station Wagen. He finally FEELS something that he thought wasn't true in the start, comes in touch with his emotions while takes his first steps out of destruction, rebuilding the once broken relationship and together contributes what feels more worthy to Davis's love & her legacy",Demolition

Demolition is that movie.It makes you think long and hard about your life, your decisions, your relationships, and what you're doing with them, without being preachy. Jake Gyllenhaal is a generational talent, and does another stellar job here.It's tagged under comedies in Netflix, which is strange. Though there are elements of humour in it, the laughs will largely be from 'oh my God, that's me in my life right now'.Makes you think if you're really 'in' any of your relationships, or are just living through them because they are 'easy' and 'convenient'.",Demolition

Good movies are so rare lately. This one might be an Oscar winner.I wanted to see other movies recently and there were a couple ofbad movies that I could not even stay and watch till the end. This is how bad the dialogue was. So when I went to see Demolition I did not have high expectations but it is really great for just seven and something stars.I also liked the actors. The only thing I did not understand was the detail about the wife at the end of the plot. I did not know what to make of that. It seemed like anything else in the plot had a meaning except this one. All in all I loved it and saved my trust in movie-making nowadays.",Demolition
178,thehoundsztoothx,I was pleased.,9,11 August 2016,"First thing is first, whoever is responsible for the distribution of this movie, Fox, probably? Y'all are so wrong for making a fan like me wait to see this film. First, it did not show in any of my nearby theaters whilst I was Western Oregon. Then, after I patiently waited for the bluRay release, I could not find a single copy on any of the shelves in my current city in central Texas. I understand that I may choose to live in tiny towns but if Batman vs Superman can be on every shelf on time then sure could Demolition!Now, even though I believe Davis did actually love his wife by the end of the movie, I still doubt he was actually, in love with her. That's a position I have been in. A lot of folks may not quite understand how someone could go as far as marriage to someone that they're not ""in love with"", but one has to remember that everyone has not been given a proper example of love in their childhood. Before you can be in love with someone, I do believe you must have either been raised with unconditional love or learn to unconditionally love yourself. However, if you lack the first, it is still quite difficult to ignite the second. Also, Davis even admitted to getting married because it was easy. Folks who lack that example are seeking it whether they are aware or not because it is, in fact, a primal need that we require to withhold the will to live. He knew she was in love with him and that seemed good enough.Then, when his wife passed, he was overwhelmed with thoughts of existence, not grief. Up until she passed, his mind was occupied with keeping up with her family and her lifestyle. One's life is not complete by satisfying the needs of another's comfort UNLESS you are unconditionally in love with that person. So, when she passed, he realized, he had not been fulfilling himself. That's where the need to demolish everything he was came from. Any empty void that consumes us as humans if we do not carefully cater to our individual desires. I must say I love my Jæ-G even more for this movie because of the timing. I know I opened up this review bashing slow distribution but that is not my Jæ-G's fault. Right now, I am single for the first time in roughly four years and it is amazing how complete of a person I am than I was when I was first coerced. Instead of physically demolishing my possessions, I simply, in one shape or form, let them go. After most of my physical possessions which had been tainted by me becoming under the influence of someone who didn't deserve me, were gone, only I was left to disassemble. Until this movie, it was not absolutely clear what I had done. However, if you look at how my blogs are organized, the way I strip my cares and self in my brain is evident. I have even named different ""personalities"" that I have discovered to carry me thus far. I am probably crazy for not thinking of most of Jake Gyllenhaal's characters as crazy, but so be it. I follow what makes sense to me because I have realized that, as the only true way to grow. No other family member, friend, partner nor spouse can lead you to yourself. They may help but the path is our own to decide. Losing anyone, or anything, that you have grown accustomed to having access to, makes you pay attention because it's drastic change. We are a result of the habits enforced by our animal browns. And frankly, most people's lives aren't changed that much because they never are forced out of their comfort zone. I just had a vision of a preview for Doctor Strange where The Ancient One forces him out of his body. That shock and detachment is necessary to view the larger picture of one's life from a distance where you are intentionally forced to pay attention and evaluate who you are becoming.On another note, I love that there was no sex, not even insinuated, in the movie. Sure I could have benefited from the visual BUT sex is a weakness to those who put it in place of actually repairing their self. He just needed a friend who showed no judgment nor expectations, who was drawn into him by his feelings. I love that after she saw how irresistibly attractive he was at the diner, that she didn't show her face. It shows that her intention for a human connection was most sincere. Sure, she was in a relationship and did not want to feel too tempted but, since when do people care about that these days? Even the fact that their relationship started with letters, is poetic. He was already infatuated with the raw attention she gave him, which he ironically, never, returned to his wife, but even more so drawn to her effort to be there for her son. It was like an effort he had not personally witnessed before. Only when he found out his own late wife was pregnant, did he start to show signs of remorse. Then again, very little was mentioned about his childhood. Which brings up yet another trait I am drawn to in my Jæ-G. He is not like us, who pretty much raised ourselves. From my understanding, he had a pretty ideal family to nurture him, yet he identifies with and represents us so well. So many of his characters have difficult childhoods. I do wonder why he chooses these type of characters. It must mean he is longing for a warrior queen like me, right? Right.",Demolition

At least this is what I think happens. The similarity to the aforementioned character pulled me out of the picture so much that I was unable to complete the emotional journey. Does he realize he really loved his wife? Does he help the young trans-questioning son of his new soul mate find his place in the world? Does he and said 'soul mate' ditch it all and run deliriously down the beach together into the happy-ever-after sunset? Does the rest of the jet plane fall on his head?
