0,Leofwine_draca,"Proves the old adage ""you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear""",5,2 April 2017,"STOKER is proof, if proof were needed, of the old adage ""you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear"". It's a film directed by Korean auteur Park Chan-wook, a man responsible for such classics as OLDBOY and SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, and he tries very hard here to breathe life and style into the material. It's a classically-shot film in which inventiveness and imagination are key in terms of the visuals, the music, and the like, but at some point I felt like Park was trying a little too hard to make his film ominous.The reason soon becomes obvious: this film's story turns out to be pretty poor, especially in the modern world. It might have worked in the 1960s or even the 1970s, but by the 2010s it all feels very obvious and all-too-familiar. It's a simplistic rip-off of Hitchcock's SHADOW OF A DOUBT; it feels an over-obvious storyline that feels dragged out endlessly and might have worked as a half hour short, but not at this length. And everything is so glaringly, blindingly obvious, I thought of half a dozen twists that would have made it a better film.The script was written by Wentworth Miller, best known as the actor in PRISON BREAK, and it's a definite case of ""don't give up the day job"". The dialogue is pat, the characters non-existent, the scenarios obvious from the word go. There are no real shocks or surprises to be found here at all. Matthew Goode is the best actor in it but has little to do other than be still and creepy, while Nicole Kidman is the usual Stepford wife. Worst of the bunch is Mia Wasikowska, who can inflect no character or feeling into her protagonist; she might as well be Alice in a brunette wig.",Stoker
1,SnoopyStyle,Beautiful but way too slow,6,24 January 2014,"India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska) is a daddy's girl who lost her beloved father. During the funeral, her mother (Nicole Kidman) introduces her long lost uncle Charles Stoker (Matthew Goode). There is something creepy about him, and she soon finds out that he's more than just creepy.Director Chan-wook Park brings an interesting moody vibe but the low energy acting and the slow moving story drains the tension right out of the movie. This is a series of beautifully shot scenes with the beautiful Mia existing in some kind of dream state. There are great scenes here and there, but it lacks a cohesive drive to force this movie along. Park has the visual skills but something is missing in translation. He struggles to breathe life into the material.",Stoker

He seems slightly creepy and soon gets cosy with her mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman.)Uncle Charlie awakens something inside of India due to his perverse behaviour which includes people close to her disappearing.Stoker should had been a belter.

3,claudio_carvalho,Boring and Pretentious,4,9 June 2013,"In the countryside of the United States, the eighteen year-old India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska) loses her father Richard (Dermot Mulroney) on the day of her birthday in a car accident. Out of the blue, her unknown uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode) visits India and her estranged and unstable mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman) cheering her up while India grieves her loss. Soon India discovers dark secrets about her mysterious uncle. But she also has a crush on Charlie.""Stoker"" is a boring and pretentious thriller by the cult South Korean director Chan-wook Park. It is impressive how Hollywood is able to destroy such great director. In the end, ""Stoker"" seems to be a suspenseful ""The Piano"" or ""The Hours"" with the weird Mia Wasikowska in the lead role and beautiful cinematography. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Segredos de Sangue"" (""Blood Secrets"")",Stoker
4,nogodnomasters,THE GROUND IS SOFT,8,6 June 2019,"The film starts off with some first person narration by India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska) a special girl who sees and hears things others do not. She is very attached to her father and has never bonded with her mother Eve (Nicole Kidman, by favorite B-movie A-lister). When her father dies, his brother Charlie (Matthew Goode) suddenly shows up and has an unusual bond with with India.The film is quirky. It is steep with symbolism, innuendos, and metaphors contained in the dialouge, wine, spiders, music, and shoes. Half of it I didn't get, maybe it was just a cinema thing. In any case the film had be fooled into thinking it was great. Charlie didn't eat and had a strange effect on women. A woman shows up who is named ""Auntie Jen."" Clearly there is something symbolic in antigen, right?About an hour of intense watching, attempting to catch clues, the film dies for me as I realize the story behind the mysterious Charlie. It was one of the more cleverly done film of this genre, I think, and for that I give it 4 stars. Clearly not for everyone.No F-bombs, that I recall. Sexual conduct, very brief nudity (Mia Wasikowska, or double.)",Stoker
5,kosmasp,Stoking,8,30 September 2013,"Stoker of course is very similar to other words that rhyme with it. What is really great about the movie, is the fact, that it is not as clean cut as some would like it to be! You can't define some moments by saying, it must be like this or like that. The movie did stay with me, after I watched it. You can speculate and try to figure out, what the director was trying to say.But what we do know is, that the acting is incredible, the framing and the color set is great too. I wouldn't say it's a Korean thing per se, but the coloring of the walls is very intense. As is the rest of the movie of course. It might be slow burning and it might raise more than one question to what is happening and what not, but it also is really great when it comes to the suspense department!",Stoker
6,lee_eisenberg,"weird, just weird",4,15 July 2013,"Park Chan-wook's first English-language movie - and Tony Scott's final movie as producer - is partly intended as a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock and comes across as a worthy effort. Unfortunately, worthy efforts do not a good movie make. ""Stoker"" is just a weird movie. Instead of a tribute to Hitchcock, we get a retread of ""Shadow of a Doubt"". I will admit that the movie has some fascinating cinematography, but can't fascinating cinematography accompany an original plot? Anyway, I do hope to see Park's other movies, especially ""Oldboy"". In the meantime, I recommend that you avoid this movie and stick to good ones like ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"". You'll be a better person for it.Am I the only one who thinks that Nicole Kidman looks like Elizabeth Montgomery on the poster?",Stoker
7,jboothmillard,Stoker,6,25 September 2013,"I think I saw this film briefly mentioned on Film 2013 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh, it had some good cast members, it was from director Chan-wook Park (Oldboy), and I noticed it was written by Prison Break actor Wentworth Miller, I was certainly going to want to see it. Basically during her eighteenth birthday party India Stoker (Alice in Wonderland's Mia Wasikowska) finds out that her father and best friend Richard (My Best Friend's Wedding's Dermot Mulroney) has been killed in a car accident, so she is left only with her unstable mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman). But following Richard's funeral they meet his charming and charismatic brother Charles (Leap Year's Matthew Goode), they have never heard of him before, he has been travelling the world, he moves in to live with them indefinitely, for support, Evelyn is happy, but India is not. Not long after Charles has moved in India ignores his attempts to befriend her, while Evelyn and he are getting intimately close, head caretaker Mrs. McGarrick (Phyllis Somerville) disappears, never to be seen again, following an argument with the uncle, and great aunt Gwendolyn (Jacki Weaver) needs to talk to the mother about her concerns about the new man in their lives. Gewndolyn tries to call from a payphone when her cellphone disappears, but Charlie tracks her down and strangles her, and going to the basement India discovers the body of Mr. McGarrick in the freezer, she is meanwhile also being bothered by school classmate Whip Taylor (Alden Ehrenreich), he eventually tries to rape her, but Charlie kills him. India helps him bury the body, and finds out that Gwendolyn was killed as well finding her cellphone in the garden, and next she finds herself being sexually aroused and masturbates at the idea of Charlie murdering his victims, and he finds out more about his travels opening a locked drawer in father Richard's office. But she is shocked to see the return address is a mental institution, so confronting Charlie he tells the truth about how he killed his and Richard's younger brother Jonathan as a child in jealousy at having less attention, he spent years in the institution, Richard paid and gave him things to stay away from his family, but Charlie killed him and staged the car crash. When Whip is reported missing Sheriff Howard (Ralph Brown) investigates and asks questions, but helping him get away with the crimes India and Charlie get close and intimate, but Evelyn catches them, she wants the truth about Richard's death, and later he tries to kill her, but India shoots him dead, buries his body in the garden and leaves in his car for New York. India hurrying to the city is pulled over for speeding by Sheriff Howard, she explains herself before taking out a pair of garden shears and stabs him in the neck, he is wounded and goes through a field, but she catches up and kills him with her rifle. Also starring Lucas Till as Pitts and Harmony Korine as Mr. Feldman. Wasikowska gives a great performance that gets you asking yourself whether she is good and misunderstood or just mad and bad, Kidman does well with her botox filled face creating a lack of movement which actually works for the creepy atmosphere, and Goode is alright at being the charming murderer. This is the Hollywood debut from director Park, and he brings his terrific dark style incorporating sexual imagery, the need for revenge and bloody death, it is a well crafted script, full of fascinating imagery, and there is definitely an unsettling feeling throughout, a very watchable Gothic thriller. Good!",Stoker
8,rmax304823,Bad Seed But Stylish Seed.,8,1 January 2015,"Nicole Kidman is the mother of drab teen-ager Mia Wasikowska. They live in a sizable and well-appointed house in rural Connecticut. Hubby disappears and his brother, David Alford shows up and begins to make moves on Kidman. Wasikowska (hereafter, Mia) turns jealous. Alford begins to hit on Mia. Kidman hates Mia when she discovers their plan to run away. Alford tries to strangle Kidman with his signature belt but Mia prevents him. Mia drives off in the family convertible to seek her fortune. The end.This may sound like some piece of formulaic trash like ""Crush,"" ""The Baby Sitter"", ""Poison Ivy"" or something of that ilk but it's miles away. The director, Chan-Wook Park, and the writer, Wentworth Miller, should be congratulated for turning what could easily have been a sow's ear into a purse.Mia Wasikowska is a young Australian who is given plain dresses, very little make up, and the personality of a loner -- one of those loners who can quickly turn vicious when provoked. Gradually a viewer become aware of the fact that underneath that humdrum appearance there is real beauty -- exotic, Florentine. Not that she ever discovers her own appeal and suddenly appears in a bright print frock to the amazement of all. The film isn't that stupid. Nope. She wears brown-and-white plain flat shoes with no heels, like the bobby-soxers of the 1940s, at least until Alford puts her shapely tootsies into sensuous black heels.The viewer may not be immediately aware of her Botticellian allure because make up and wardrobe have made her into the high school wallflower. But the director is aware of it. He presents the viewer with a few tasteful but tempting upskirt shots, and there is a scene in which Mia masturbates in the shower, with a minimum of nudity.It's that particular scene that alerts the viewer to the fact that this is more than an erotic thriller, because Mia gets off on the memory of a recent murder she witnessed, and the murderer was Alford. It gets complicated and I don't want to give away too much information about the plot. Medical discretion forbids.I expect you'll find it a difficult movie to shake out of your head because Park has imposed a style on this film that's his alone. It doesn't imitate Hitchcock, for a change. Park seems fond not only of women's shoes, a quirk he shares with Luis Buñuel. He's fond of multiple flashbacks that, collectively, unravel the mystery of Alford's past. It's not a healthy past. And there are times when it's impossible to tell a real-life event from a fantasy, which only adds to the confusion.As for Alford himself, he's blandly handsome and wears a bland smile. Nicole Kidman is no spring chicken but she's a splendid actress and still exudes a cloud of pheromones. There is only one murder shown on screen and it's bloodless, unless you count splattering a duck in midair as a murder. But there is gore aplenty, and some of it is questionable. Why Mia would want to slit the sheriff's throat is beyond my understanding. I suppose the point is that madness tends to run in families. Actually, it does, but so do medical degrees.",Stoker
9,paul_haakonsen,A different mystery thriller...,5,22 September 2013,"I will start out by saying that the way that ""Stoker"" is shot and filmed is actually enough to make the movie worth watching. The camera-work here and the angles used is just amazing. There is just something pristine and unique to the entire feel of the movie because of this extraordinary camera-work.Storywise, then I found ""Stoker"" to be a little bit strange. It is about the Stoker family, where the father dies in a tragic accident. And then the estranged brother shows up at the house on the same day. Tensions are brooding and webs of intrigue are woven in the Stoker house.Personally, then I didn't really care much for the storyline, as it tended to slip out on a sidetrack a bit too often, straying out into parts that didn't necessarily help further the story along in tune with an overall red thread. And that made the movie a little bit skittish and jumpy for me. But at the same time, then there were some really interesting and strange deviations in the story, which is something that you wouldn't necessarily find in many other movies.What really carried the movie aside from the camera-work was the acting. Mia Wasikowska, playing India, really did a phenomenal job with the reclusive and introverted character that she portrayed. And Matthew Goode, playing Charles Stoker, also did put on a great performance, and he really had that whole mystery and shrouded agenda thing nailed down perfectly. Although Nicole Kidman, playing Evelyn, didn't have a role all that great, then she did bring her usual good performance and presence to the movie.If you enjoy a mystery thriller that is something out of the ordinary, then ""Stoker"" is well worth a watch. However, just bring an open mind, because ""Stoker"" does tend to think out of the sandbox most of the time in terms as mystery thriller goes.I am giving the movie 5 out of 10 stars, based on the camera-work and the acting, which was ultimate dragged down by a story that tried too much and didn't fully manage to bring together all that it put out there.",Stoker
10,Coventry,What do you mean it's not about Dracula?,5,23 May 2015,"I hope that I'm not the only idiot in the world, but up until I started watching ""Stoker"", I seriously assumed that it was going to be a period piece and semi-biographical film about the legendary Irish-born author of Dracula: Abraham ""Bram"" Stoker You know, kind of similar to Ken Russell's 1986 film ""Gothic"" which handled about the events leading up to Mary Shelley writing her immortal story Frankenstein. Well it's not, clearly, and it doesn't even remotely involve Gothic novels or vampires. The last name of the family of lead characters is Stoker but not a word about a possible bloodline. This certainly doesn't mean, however, that the film suddenly becomes entirely uninteresting for me because of that. After all, this still remains the Hollywood debut of the awesome and visionary director Chan-Wook Park (from the Japanese ""vengeance"" trilogy) and I'm always in the mood for stories about dysfunctional families. Moreover, the script is written by the mediocre actor Wentworth Miller and for some inexplicable reason mediocre actors quite often turn out to be adequate writers. But alas, ""Stoker"" is ultimately a huge disappoint, more specifically a classic case of ""style-over- substance"" and far too many recycled ideas. The basic plot and denouement are reasonably good, but this kind of semi-perverted stories already featured in dozens of cheap & gritty 70s exploitation/grindhouse and nobody ever wants to give any praise to those films. Sweet-sixteen cynical girl India Stoker loses her beloved father in a mysterious car accident, but she gains a charming young uncle of which nobody knew he existed. Her mother clearly thinks that Uncle Charlie is a vast improvement over her late husband, or at least I think she does, because Nicole Kidman's face is so full of Botox that I couldn't make out any emotional expressions. Since the arrival of Charles several other people are vanishing, like the elderly household lady or that friendly old aunt, but nobody seems to be alarmed about this and the plot exclusively centers on the odd chemistry that gradually develops. ""Stoker"" is boring and slow, and the only thing that kept me awake (my wife actually fell asleep) was the beautiful photography and a handful of stylish Chan-Wook Park trademarks. The subtle and not-so- subtle references towards Alfred Hitchcock's repertoire – ""Shadow of a Doubt"" and ""Psycho"" in particular – form a nice touch but this won't be recognized by the younger generations of cinema fans at whom this film is also clearly aimed. The film is surprisingly violent, though, but the the vileness doesn't fit the narrative style.",Stoker
11,sunwarrior13,Stoker Is Style Over Substance,8,5 May 2014,"Stoker is a film that tells the story of the dysfunctional Stoker family.It stars Mia Wasikowska, Matthew Goode, Nicole Kidman and Dermot Mulroney.It was written by Wentworth Miller and directed by Park Chan- wook,who known for South Korean films like Oldboy,in his English- language movie debut. On her eighteenth birthday, India has her life turned upside down after her father Richard dies in a horrific car accident. After that happened,she stayed with her unstable mother Evelyn. At Richard's funeral, both were introduced to Richard's charming and charismatic brother Charlie,whom they both don't know about. Then, he announces that he is staying with them indefinitely to help support India and Evelyn.Soon after his arrival, India suspect him of his ulterior motives.But instead of feeling outrage or horror, she feels increasingly infatuated with his uncle after finding him repulsive at first.Things started to become worse she discovers that he has an affair with her mother,Evelyn.The rest of the movie revolves around the three main characters of the movie and their relationship with one another as well as they try to read each others motives with regards to their relationship with one another.While the film is definitely not for everyone or would promise to become a blockbuster,Park delivers in his English movie debut the same way he did with movies like Oldboy as it has an screenplay that tries to examine the dysfunction among the members of the Stoker family - India,Evelyn and Charlie.Aside from being a character-driven film,the film manages to transcend into different genres such as a psychological thriller,drama,horror,a movie with strong sexuality,mystery and even an action film.Added to that,the viewer gets to see great acting the three main characters such as Wasikowska, Goode and Kidman.But overall,the movie is more about style and substance that one may get lost as to what is going on in the story.At the same time,a viewer may also find the movie somewhat weird and awkward as it is up to the viewer to interpret on what is going on in the film and what the main characters are really all about.In the end,the style over substance cinema somewhat diminished the film from a great film into being barely watchable and serviceable as a dark film.",Stoker
12,LeonLouisRicci,Sight and Sound Enhance Classical Story,9,20 August 2013,"The best Stylist Directors use all of the elements of Film to create and transcend Movies and present an elevated multi-faceted Entertainment. This is an example. Taking the Classical Story, Coming of Age Rage and muting it with serene Scenes with limited Dialog enhanced by a Poetic Visual Maximum.Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt (1943) is the homage here with a dash of a physical, emotional, and chilling representation of Norman Bates and then there's the Suspense you can cut with a knife, or in this case any convenient Weapon lying around. At work here is a belt, rock, rifle, gardening shears, and more.It is a subtle, quiet, violent, Psycho-Sexual Story. The Soundtrack, both Musically and Effects are used to heighten the Horror. Uncle Charlie uses Piano Duets to Seduce both Sister-In-Law and Niece bringing them to near Orgasm while sharing the Keyboard and the Bench.This is a unique and diverting entry in the multitude of Maniac and Serial Killer Movies and is Self-Conscious Cinema done by a Self-Confident Director.",Stoker
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,The flames either erupt or die out,7,8 October 2014,"Richard Stoker is being buried. He leaves behind his daughter, India(Wasikowska, quiet and restrained, with a hidden passion you can't take your eyes off hers) and widow Evelyn(Kidman, resentful). But they won't be the only two residents of the family home for long. Uncle Charlie(Goode, equally devious and handsome) appears, out of nowhere, and moves in. Not only does this strain some already bad relationships isn't there also something strange going on?This is a polarizing one. You love it or hate it. It's difficult to argue for either side. Because on one hand, this is a beautifully filmed, edited, scored, acted(such subtlety) movie, creepy, full of suspense and tension leading to brutal violence, with a mystery that is gripping until the flat, climax-less ending that takes a lot away as we learn the truth and the symbolism, great, though there's also a bit too much of it. On the other, the story doesn't flow, we never fully understand the characters or scenes(which stop suddenly, or start midway into a conversation), and ultimately, while it is well-told, the plot is not as complex as it may seem at first.It matters a lot what mindset you go into it with. You should probably know something about director Park Chan-Wook, most known for Oldboy, the Vengeance Trilogy(which I have yet to watch, but they are on my list), going in. He doesn't seem to have been compromised by Hollywood, albeit the language barrier may have impacted the final product. It's very much a slow burn. It owes debts to De Palma, Lynch, Burton, and, especially, Hitchcock – without any of them being ripped off. As the first script by Wentworth Miller, this is good, and I hope he keeps working on that this shows promise.The Blu-Ray comes with the well-done 28 minute featurette Stoker: A Filmmaker's Journey, 16 minute interesting Theatrical Behind The Scenes, 15 and a half minutes of worthwhile Red Carpet Interviews, 10 minutes of good deleted(well, extended) scenes, a great 5 minute musical performance, slick trailers and TV spots(note that they contain big spoilers), and dozens of gripping stills in the Image Gallery, and a bunch from London Theater Design.In addition to what I've already mentioned, there is some nudity and sexuality(and a lot of sensuality) and breaking of taboos in this. I recommend this to anyone who can imagine themselves liking this. 7/10",Stoker

15,morrison-dylan-fan,"""You've opened the door,now you have to go through it!"".",7,6 March 2013,"When I first heard about the making of Stoker a few months ago,I originally expected that the movie would be a bio-pic about Dracula author Bram Stoker.Finding out that my guess was completely wrong when seeing the trailer for the film,I began to get very excited in seeing highly-praised Korean Noir director Park Chan-Wook stoke the flames from his fiery mix of Neo-Noir and Horror across the pond for the first time.The plot:Attending the funeral of her dad Richard after he died in a mysterious accident,disenfranchised and isolated teen India Stoker notices that a stranger is standing near by her distressed and grieving mother Evelyn.Going up to the stranger during the wake being held for her father,India is shocked to discover that the stranger is actually an uncle who she has never heard about before called Charles Stoker.With having comforted Evelyn for most of the day,Charles gives India the good news that he has accepted her mother's kind offer of staying at their house so that he can help her during the grieving process.A few days later:Feeling very uneasy about how close Charles seems to be getting to her mother, India is also surprised to discover,that the present which her dad has wrapped up for her, (that she expected to contain his traditional Birthday present for her-shoes) is weirdly a box that contains nothing.Giving Mia a moment of calm,a maid/family friend called Mrs.McGarrick comes to pay a visit,to make sure that everything is going OK for the family.Catching Mia on her on,McGarrick gives India a key that she says is her ""urgent"" present for her,and also tells India the phone number for the motel room that she is staying at.Ringing the number later on that night, India is sad to find McGarrick not picking up the phone so that they can have a private conversation.Reluctantly enjoying the dinner that Charles has cooked for her and Evelyn the next night,India is asked if she can go and get the ice cream out of the far off freezer in the house,so that they can all have a nice desert.Pulling the frozen tubs of ice cream out of the freezer,India suddenly feels a cold chill run down her spine,when she discovers the dead body of Mrs.McGarrick frozen solid in the freezer.View on the film:Avoiding the pitfalls that other directors have made when they have attempted to strike gold at the English language market by taking away the things which made their work distinctive,to instead create something, shockingly soulless (a prime example being Dario Argento's Adrien Brody starring Giallo) director Park Chan-Wook shows from the opening scene of the film,the he is determined that nothing ends up being lost in translation.Closely working with art director Wing Lee and regular collaborating cinematography Chung Chung-Hoon,Wook uses expertly handled,extremely stylised camera moves to create a haunting Neo-Noir atmosphere where something about the off-centre attitude of the whole Stokes family leads to the film having a great feeling that the audience are watching the characters walk on eggs which could break at any moment.Making the moments where things crack for the characters ones that hit the viewer with a tough punch,Wook gives the violence in the movie a strong raw edge by never flinching at the moments where it reaches its intensity,and also showing how the effect of witnessing the violence takes India out of her child hood world,and into the dark,bleak world of adulthood.Contrasting the low-lit,Gothic Horror Neo-Noir cloud that uncle Charles is casting over the family,Wook shows the innocent,childhood world that India is attempting to cling onto,by turning the brightness of the colours up to their maximum.Showing India's childhood world to be one filled with beautiful,eye-popping red,green and yellows,Wook expertly uses the fantastic score by Clint Mansell to show how the sweet,cheerful sounds of India's dreams of have transformed into cold,sharp bursts of brutal reality.Whilst Wook shows a tremendous eye with his stylish directing,and each of the terrific cast members gives strong,icy performances,the debut screenplay by Wentworth Miller disappointing make the film's plot feel tangled up,and also twice as long then it actually is,thanks to the scripts slowness.For the first half of the film,Miller takes an exciting scatter-shot approach,where the childhood daydreams of India clash with the dark realities that Charles is bringing into the family,Miller gradually pulls back from the scatted,cut up imagines that he has put down in the film,to turn the scenes into clarified image's and to also deliver a breathing taking,shocking end,that disappointingly never materialises.Focusing on the relationship between Charles and India for the whole of the movie,Miller makes the ending twist of the relationship between India and Charles one that feels disappointingly hollow,thanks to the revaluation that he delivers feeling very safe and unable to match the sense of anticipation that he had built up in the first half,which leads to the flames that Wook stokes having far more smoke,than the roaring flames that he truly deserved.",Stoker
16,FlashCallahan,"It's a 94, the year you were born....",7,3 March 2013,"India was not prepared to lose her father and best friend in a tragic accident. The solitude of her family estate, the peace of her town, and the somber feel of her home life is suddenly upended by the sudden arrival of her Uncle Charlie, whom she never knew existed. When Charlie moves in with her and her emotionally unstable mother, India thinks the void left by her father's death is finally being filled by him. Soon after his arrival, India comes to suspect that this mysterious, charming man has ulterior motives. Yet instead of being vexed, she becomes increasingly infatuated with him...Miller has written a cracking story, and a terrific script, but the problem with this film is that it could have been at least 30 minutes longer to flesh out ore characters and see India spend more time with family. The audience are kept at arms length from the three Stokers, and it feels like we only get a brief glimpse of the madness.Other than this, the cast are fantastic, Goode overplays the staring 'is there something wrong with him?' act a little too much, and almost comes across like David in A.I.Kidman has never been better, playing a character almost as cold as her house, but Wasikowska is fantastic as India, a sort of hybrid of all troubled teens seen in some other movies. Think Thirteen meets Carrie, by way of the recent Excision, and you get an idea of India.She's not particularly strange by any means, but the arrival of Charlie sparks something off in her, maybe psychological, maybe genetic.It's beautiful to look at, the mise en scene adds to the tension of the movie, and it has a fifties feel to it throughout.It's as good as the directors domestic efforts, but with nods to Hitchcock and other thrillers, it's certainly a standout movie.",Stoker
17,phd_travel,Stylish direction and spellbinding performances,9,16 July 2013,"A mysterious uncle comes to stay with his niece and sister in law upon the death of his brother.The direction is quite mesmerizing. Hope to see more English language movies from this talented Korean director. He draws you into this strange world quite subtly and effectively. The details shown and the focus on the expressions of the actors keeps one watching every scene carefully. The acting is top notch. Nicole Kidman's cosmetic procedures have settled down and she looks younger and more beautiful than she has for quite some time. Matthew Goode is very suited to his role as the mysterious uncle and he plays it just right. Mia is becoming one of the most captivating actresses and she takes on this difficult enigmatic role with great skill. The various encounters between the characters is full of tension and suspense in a modern Hitchcock way especially the piano duet and hair brushing scenes.Liked the house with it's creepy but elegant combination of old structure and new details.The story keeps one guessing and interested from the first scene till the last. The ending is complete enough which is good. There aren't any things left hanging. But after watching the movie you may feel a bit of an ""is that all?"". Would have preferred a different more feel good outcome. It isn't an irritating end just a tiny bit formula and not unexpected.Overall the style direction and acting are all excellent.

The magnetism of the film beings while the credits are being shown over the background of a beautifully wooded area where a girl is walking toward a roadside. The voice over, that of the main character India Stoker, states 'My ears hear what others cannot hear; small faraway things people cannot normally see are visible to me. These senses are the fruits of a lifetime of longing, longing to be rescued, to be completed. Just as the skirt needs the wind to billow, I'm not formed by things that are of myself alone. I wear my father's belt tied around my mother's blouse, and shoes which are from my uncle. This is me. Just as a flower does not choose its color, we are not responsible for what we have come to be. Only once you realize this do you become free, and to become adult is to become free.'The plot can be summarized as follows without providing information that would destroy the suspenseful movement of this strange story: India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska) was not prepared to lose her father and best friend Richard (Dermot Mulroney) in a tragic auto accident. The solitude of her woodsy family estate, the peace of her tranquil town, and the unspoken somberness of her home life are suddenly upended by not only this mysterious accident, but by the sudden arrival of her Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), whom she never knew existed. When Charlie moves in with her and her emotionally unstable mother Evie (Nicole Kidman), India thinks the void left by her father's death is finally being filled by his closest bloodline. Soon after his arrival, India comes to suspect that this mysterious, charming man has ulterior motives. Yet instead of feeling outrage or horror, this friendless young woman becomes increasingly infatuated with him. Yet it is on her 18th birthday that things dramatically change. There are plot twists that defy expectations in this movie whose elegant creativity is the biggest twist of all.The musical score for the film is the work of Clint Mansell who repeatedly inserts excerpts from Verdi's opera 'Il Trovatore' - the aria 'Stride la Vampa' sung by the ominous gypsy Azucena ('Screeches the blaze! The restless mob runs to the fire with happy faces'). Every detail of this polished thriller has been expertly conceived. The strong supporting cast includes Phyllis Somerville, Jacki Weaver, Lucas Till, Alden Ehrenreich and others. This is an example of expert film craftsmanship on the part of everyone concerned.

20,zetes,Excellent,9,17 March 2013,"Hollywood, since its beginning, has attracted foreign directors looking to expand their popularity throughout the world (okay, or to make a lot of money). Many lose their way in America, however. Park's fellow countryman, Kim Jee-woon, recently failed miserably (at least at the box office - I haven't seen the film and am still looking forward to it) with the Arnold Schwarzenegger flick The Last Stand. Park Chan-wook has a more distinctive style than Kim does, and it would have been a huge shame to see him make something cookie-cutter for his English language debut. Amazingly, Park comes through crystal clear with Stoker. It's very much a follow-up to Thirst, which in my opinion is his greatest film, with its bravura cinematography and obsessive attention to detail. The script, written by Wentworth Miller, is a fairly standard thriller. It kind of reminds me of The Stepfather. Park takes it and creates a gorgeous work of art. Mia Wasikowska stars as India Stoker, a quiet, weird girl with heightened senses who worships her father (Dermot Mulroney). As the film opens, she receives the news that her father has died in a car accident. At the funeral, she meets her father's younger brother (Matthew Goode), whom she has never been told about. There's something strange about him, and Wasikowsa doesn't much like the way he's flirting with her mother (Nicole Kidman), with whom she doesn't get along. The plot develops in a fairly predictable way, but Park's mastery of the medium makes it a roller-coaster ride.",Stoker
21,deloudelouvain,Saw better from Chan-wook Park.,5,27 August 2020,"I found Stoker a bit disappointing, was expecting something better from Chan-wook Park. The directing wasn't bad though but the story was a bit slow, slightly confusing and not really making much sense towards the end. Whilst the cinematography and the acting weren't bad, it's not a guarantee for a good movie. For that the plot was just not effective enough, I don't really have a high opinion of writer Wentworth Miller, maybe he should just stick to acting instead of writing. The acting of Mia Wasikowska, Nicole Kidman and Matthew Goode were good though, too bad the pace was so slow, it could and should have been better.",Stoker
22,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Stoker,8,23 March 2013,"Park Chan Wook probably outdone himself with Stoker given the casting coup of his leading players in the film, which surprisingly is written by Wentworth Miller of Prison Break fame. It's quite unlike any other, telling of a twisted tale of grooming, steeped in sex, violence and coming of age, with an exuberance of sensuousness draping every scene, so seductively shot that you'll clamour for a repeated viewing to partake in its themes and probably gawk at its visuals all over again in this psycho-sexual thriller like none other.It takes a while to piece things together, where we meet up with India (Mia Wasikowska), a teenager who seems extremely disturbed, aloof and all, having to deal with the recent death of her father. Mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman) seem to have taken it in her stride, then again because of the presence of her husband's brother Charlie (Matthew Goode), a man whom both mother and daughter have not met in years, who had now come as a source of comfort living under the same roof, with both women being drawn to the enigma of the man, only for a slow nightmare to unravel, and serve as India's catalyst in growing up.Park's first Hollywood film continues in his tradition of tackling narratives that come with complexity, where nothing is just quite what it seems, providing that bit of discomfort when you finally thought you had nailed down to just what the story's about, but not quite. And credit goes to Miller for this unconventional story in what I thought was an extremely sly take on growing up, identity, and grooming even, though not of the usual positive values one inculcates in a young one. It's almost like the making of a killer with the pushing of one's boundaries with temptation, and constant goading even, as epitomized by Goode's Charlie in being there when India needed someone, and then equipping her with the confidence necessary to go over the edge, given her at her most vulnerable, and impressionable.It's a psychological game being waged, with Charlie being the most fascinating of the characters here as the spark in one's life that throws it topsy-turvy, complete with a backstory and in current terms can be considered as the Devil incarnate, looking for that earthly apprentice to pass the reins to in becoming a walking havoc machine, and yet keeping you constantly wondering who's who, and what's what, untangling true and hidden intentions through perverse love affairs that's romantic and yet almost incestuous all at the same time, with possessiveness the main negative by product of an affair going to get, or already gone wrong.Mia Wasikowska plays her darkest role in a character yet, as her previous roles have somehow bookended her and limited her acting range, and she has Park Chan-Wook to thank for something like this to roll along, and break out from her usual stereotype to take on something more sinister and challenging. Nicole Kidman was under-used, appearing in a few scenes and being nothing more than a flower vase, and lending star power to the marquee. Goode on the other hand stole the show being the thorn amongst the roses, and indeed if not for his fiendishly good performance, you wouldn't find it credible how one man can string both women along to an explosive conclusion.While you grapple with the story, you're likely to be wowed by the sumptuous imagery that fills the landscape in the film, blessed with rich cinematography by Chung Chung-hoon, Park Chan Wook's frequent collaborator, that does the least in betraying the twisted tale that comes with the film. With music contributed by Clint Mansell, whose soundtrack lifts the movie up altogether into another dimension, Stoker has elements that demands repeated viewings to capture the nuances and gems layered in its story, with commanding performances being that icing on the cake. It's not an easy film to sit through for its subject matter, but boy it sure is gorgeously done.",Stoker

Also, the cast is perfectly chosen for this film, the acting superb and the direction flawless.All in all it should have been a fantastic film. But when it ended, I felt nothing but incredulity. All that setup, all the tension, the inexplicable events, the long scenes with atmospheric music, it all leads to nothing? Kind of a complete let down that then retroactively poisons the entire experience. It wasn't that I wanted supernatural beings in the film, but I wanted a lesson, something that I could take away when the film was over, perhaps a chance for a sequel that makes it all worth it, but there was none.Bottom line: it's not an empty movie, quite the opposite, the scenes are detailed and the characters built well; it just leads to nothing.

But STOKER suffices as a hotbed for the monomania runs in the family bloodline, a maniac returns to his long-lost family and enkindles the evil out of his only kin, sounds like a horror-slasher, but the film tends to be a rite-of-passage for our protagonist India, a girl lost his father at her 18th birthday, meanwhile, murders are all around the family, even the trailer neither cares to hush up the victims nor to reveal the culprit (poor two-times Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver). The ethereal atmosphere is ubiquitous in the film, sets against the contemporary society, the family basically is insulated in its villa, with succinct tête-à-têtes and reserved rejoinders among three leading characters, which does not effectively propel the storyline, it is the detailed camera-work, meticulously heaps up the triangle incestuous appeal among the three, Chan-wook adopts quite a few uncommon modi operandi to hone up the tension and flashback the hidden history of the past, the stop-motion shots in the beginning and the incessant time-and-space jump montages might engender some inconvenience for the eyes, but undoubtedly they lend the film a posh brio, so is the tableaux-alike settings, jibes with the oriental philosophy of subdued emotion under a placid surface. Mia Wasikowska excels herself in upholding her morose frostiness, the masturbating orgasm could be regarded as a metaphor for her career-elevation, sheds the protection of adolescence and challenges herself to darker and more dangerous orbit, Alice doesn't live there anymore! Matthew Goode, albeit his very underused career path, finally secures a leading role excavating his double-faced charm and menace, even after his real identity has been unearthed and his doom has been pre-designed, he still launches a sympathetic glamour in his inexplicable possession towards his niece whom he has never seen before. Nicole Kidman, whom I find perplexed to take on such an unsympathetic and flat role and if as rightful as it is reported, a tailor-made request from Chan-wook. Finally, its has a killing soundtrack, a cocktail of Nancy Sinatra & Lee Hazlewood's SUMMER WINE and a quasi-vampire allegory, I've found my snug corner to embrace the 99 minutes of how slaughter becomes a genetic heredity and the frisson is all over the place!",Stoker
25,Red-Barracuda,A modern update on Shadow of a Doubt,8,17 February 2013,"This is the first English language film from South Korean director Chan-Wook Park. He is probably most famous for the intense psychological thriller Oldboy. With his American debut he reigns in the extremity somewhat but does retain the visual inventiveness that is also one of his trademarks. In many ways Stoker is a modern update of Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt (1943). Like that one, this film has a mysterious uncle re-emerge into the life of a family after many years of absence. Before long it becomes pretty clear that all is not as it seems with this man and he is in fact extremely dangerous. The main character is an 18 year old girl called India Stoker played by Mia Wasikowska who was recently in the not very good but very popular Alice in Wonderland. She leads the film very well and carries off the bookish character effectively. There is also able support from Nicole Kidman as her mother.The look and feel of Stoker is impressive. The atmosphere is well sustained throughout. If I had a criticism it would simply be that the story ultimately isn't all that original and there aren't really a lot of surprises. What it does do though is to take a fairly standard psychological thriller story and make it interesting by way of cinematic techniques. It isn't a movie that is exactly going to break the mould but it is pretty accomplished nevertheless and is a pretty good first English language feature from its director.",Stoker
26,KineticSeoul,Park Chan-wook's English language film debut,8,6 July 2013,"The Korean director Chan-wook Park is known for making psychological/mental thrillers or dramas that goes in a warped direction when it comes to storytelling. This one I must say is a vivid and visceral experience when it comes to the visuals and the story had my attention most of the way through. Because of the mystery and suspense despite the calm and mellow atmosphere. Some people seemed to bash on this film because of it's artistic style since it goes in the art house direction. But unlike most art house movies this one is intriguing while not being all that self-indulgent. There is so many art house movies that is self-indulgent but this one is the one that gets bashed on by some people. Sure the editing and timing between scenes including the visuals add a lot of creativity to the mix, but it's mostly appealing. With a good enough story to back it up. And when it comes down to the cinematography and visuals shown in a artistic manner. well it's a treat for the most part. Usually when it comes to art house movies, I kinda found it to be boring with the exception of ""Drive"". But this one is enthralling and the main star of this movie which is the visuals like I mentioned made me want to see more. This movie sort of reminded me of a Korean movie ""Paju"" when it comes to certain relationships shown in the movie and other films as well. But the direction it goes makes this it's own film. The cast is just fantastic in this as well. Mia Wasikowska brings this pretty and yet elegant/innocent type of characteristic with a bit of mystery which is crucial to the story and for this movie to work. Although when it comes to the pretty aspect it's already a done deal. When it comes to Matthew Goode I was really impressed with his role in ""Burning Man"" and he is right on target with this one. His character needed to be this creepy/mysterious and yet charismatic and handsome guy that is a bit off but charming and he brought every bit of those characteristic for his character. When it comes to Nicole Kidman, well she is just good with roles like these. You will actually see a lot of Chan-wook Park's trademarks in this movie and the artistic blend makes this a film most definitely worth seeing. I for one appreciated this movie for what it is. Is it one of the best art house movies I seen, maybe not but it's still a really good. The most shocking of all is the fact that this story is written by Wentworth Miller(the Prison Break guy). He should stay on as a writer, he might not be the best actor but he is a intelligent one.8.2/10",Stoker
27,Hellmant,Fans of Chan-wook Park's are sure to be pleased!,8,19 April 2013,"'STOKER': Four Stars (Out of Five)Chan-wook Park (the South Korean director of popular flicks like 'OLDBOY', 'LADY VENGEANCE' and 'THIRST') makes his American film directing debut with this Hitchcockian horror film written by actor Wentworth Miller (of 'PRISON BREAK' fame). It tells the tale of a young woman coping with her father's tragic death who also has to deal with the sudden appearance of a mysterious uncle she never knew she had. The film stars Mia Wasikowska, Nicole Kidman and Matthew Goode. It's a little slow paced at the start and highly disturbing by the end but it's overall a very interesting and bizarrely entertaining film (just like Park's other work). Upon turning 18 India Stoker (Wasikowska) is startled to find out that her father (Dermot Mulroney), who she was very close to, died in a horrific car crash. At the funeral she's also startled by the sudden appearance of an uncle, Charlie (Goode), she never knew she had. Charlie has come to live with India and her emotionally disturbed mother, Evie (Kidman). He's very charming but also very creepy and India wants nothing to do with him but her mother is delighted by his presence. When the caretaker of the house (Phyllis Somerville) and a visiting, concerned, great aunt (Jacki Weaver) both go missing India is given even more reason not to trust her Uncle Charlie.The film plays out kind of like a vampire movie and was inspired by Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' as much as Hitchcock's work (especially the film 'SHADOW OF A DOUBT'). The script is not nearly as impressive as Park's directing though, who really makes the film a very visceral and creepy experience. The acting is all decent as well and the characters are all intriguing. The film is definitely disturbing though and not for those that don't enjoy horror flicks (especially the Hitchcock kind). I'd say it's a near masterpiece but a little too slow moving for me at times and far too dark by it's conclusion. Still an interesting and entertaining film though. Fans of Park's are sure to be pleased!

28,Buddy-51,Largely unmemorable psychological thriller,5,14 September 2013,"Directed by Park Chan-wook, ""Stoker"" is a Southern Gothic tale replete with insanity, incest, murder, attempted rape and deep dark family secrets. India (Mia Wasikowska) is a troubled 18-year-old whose attractive, sports-car-driving uncle (Matthew Goode) moves in with her and her mother (Nicole Kidman) upon the death of her beloved father. And before you know it, people are hanging around in corners whispering confidentially, bodies are dropping like flies, mama and her deceased husband's kid brother are making googly eyes at one another , and India is beginning to develop some awfully inappropriate feelings for her dear not-so-old Uncle Charlie. On top of all that, India is learning that she may have some hitherto undiscovered paranormal ability that allows her to ""see what other people can't see, hear what other people can't hear."" Though the movie establishes an effective mood and atmosphere throughout, the screenplay by Wentworth Miller is cryptic almost to the point of incoherence, as if the writers couldn't establish their coolness credentials and ""hipness"" bona fides if they didn't oversell their case. And oversell it they do, as the audience tries its damnedest to make some sort of sense out of what on earth is going on. If you feel you can afford to take a precious hour-and-38 minutes out of your life to do so, by all means welcome to it.

29,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Its complex direction hides its shallow nature.,6,30 March 2021,"'Stoker (2013)' tells the familiar tale of an enigmatic, long-lost family member emerging after the death of a patriarchal figure, doing little to differentiate itself from the plethora of other movies in its subgenre. When it boils right down to it, it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect it to be. As such, it all feels rather... inconsequential. It plays its hand far too early in some aspects and, in general, is just incredibly predictable. Even its more extreme elements are presented in a somewhat 'neutered' fashion, feeling like they were included to shock rather than to elevate the story (or, even, make it more unique). That's not to say the film is bad, though. It's a relatively engaging and entertaining in-the-moment experience that does have some interesting aspects. The most obvious of these is its avant-garde direction from Park Chan-Wook, which is turned up to eleven in almost every single scene. This creates an odd effect that does elevate the flick's mysterious atmosphere, even if it sometimes seems a little too 'arty' for its own good. Another thing the film has going for it is its strong cast, each of whom turn in fairly strong performances. The overall thing just falls down in retrospection, though, because it doesn't really do anything all that special. Its overly complex direction hides the fact that it isn't all that deep, something which becomes clearer and clearer the longer you spend thinking about it. It's one of Park's weakest films, for sure. Still, it's a decent mystery-thriller. It's entertaining enough while it lasts. 6/10.",Stoker
30,bowmanblue,Kind of like a car crash - I couldn't look away,7,17 January 2015,"'Stoker' is a story about... actually, I'm not entirely sure. Having sat through the whole film, I find it quite hard to describe. A mother and a daughter (who act like they're living in the eighteenth century - I had to wait until I saw a cell phone and convertible sports car to realise it was in the present day) invite their long lost uncle to stay. He acts weird. But then both the mother and the daughter also act weird (kind of like they are, or should be, on medication), so it's a little hard to have a baseline for 'normal.' Anyway, without spoiling it too much, bodies start piling up.I didn't like this film. Despite the many positive reviews I found it boring and the dialogue long, rambling and, in many cases, pointless. I decided I didn't like it very early in the film, so, why didn't I turn it off? I just couldn't help but watch it through until the end. Even when it was finished, I wasn't entirely satisfied. There are a few questions that are open to debate (you'll have to check out the internet message boards if you want to delve into what people believe is really happening). However, for whatever reason, I couldn't put this film out of my mind.I reckon I'll even watch it again one day, just to see what it's like a second time round.Ultimately, Stoker is weird, creepy and disturbing, not to mention subtly odd, but then I think that's the idea, so I guess it succeeded. If you're thinking of watching it, you'll be in for an odd ride. Just make sure you're in the mood for something like that when you do and you'll probably enjoy it (or, like me, if you didn't technically enjoy it, then you'll still find it weirdly addictive).",Stoker
31,dromasca,horror is not lost in translation,8,26 September 2013,"I read that director Chan-wook Park decided to go into movies after seeing Hitchcock's Vertigo. He grew up into becoming one of the most successful directors of horror movies in the Korean school of cinema and he now pays back his dept with Stoker - his first American film - which would not have made his master blush at all in my opinion.The story in Stoker has all basic ingredients of the classical horror movies. We are in a small town and most of the action takes place in an isolated mansion. The father dies and the 18-year daughter has to deal with her personal trauma and with her mother who seems to be eager to forget as soon as possible and to start the next phase of her life. At the funeral the younger uncle shows up, an uncle the girl has never heard about before, who will stay in the house and take back a place left void by the father who disappeared. It sounds like a family drama, and up to a certain point it is, but the signs of incertitude are there from the beginning, as the descent into horror is not at all unexpected. Mother-to-daughter relations and the mix of grief and coming to age have seldom looked so frightening.Acting plays a central role in the way Park builds his story, characters, and the relations between them. Each of the three lead characters can be considered a slight mis-casting, but this is intentional as none of the heroes really feels well into her or his own skin. Nicole Kidman plays another variant of her 'beautiful mature lady in trouble' type she specialized in for the last decade, with an extra touch of evil and despair. Matthew Goode is as disquieting as he is handsome. Mia Wasikowska is the one who steals the whole show, and as spectator I spent most of the film wondering who she really is - angel or daemon, victim or predator.Chan-wook Park brings to this film the techniques and the atmosphere of the Korean thriller, but he transplants these well into an American story. He plays with the symbols of the American horror films tradition, even allowing himself a shower scene which quotes directly from Hitchcock (but Polanski's influence is also present). I do not know what he exactly plans for the future and there are reasons of concern in my opinion because his genre of films is being under-appreciated by American serious movie goers and his style has an implicit and subtle violence which does not necessarily translate into enough blood on screen for success with the larger audiences. At some point in time he will need to invent something new to keep the interest alive, let us just hope that it will be at least as good as Stoker.",Stoker

This film plays itself off as a thriller, but it's much deeper than that. This is the kind of film that will play mind tricks with you and there are many mysteries entrenched in the puzzle that only the viewer has the key to unlock. This film can be disturbing, but its use of imagery and narrative techniques really make this film beautiful.Chan Wook-Park, known for his taste in mysterious characters and rich imagery, directs his first English film here. It's about a girl named India Stoker whose father was just killed in an auto accident. She meets her uncle for the first time at his funeral, a mysterious person indeed. But when she becomes drawn more into his life which features ulterior motives, she gets even more drawn into him instead of the opposite.The acting is actually pretty darn good. Mia Wasikowska does a very good job as India, who does not betray her emotions despite her dark soul. Nicole Kidman does a decent job as India's emotionally-unstable mother. Matthew Goode has a boatload of talent and he uses it well in this film.Overall, Stoker is a dark, twisting, mind-bending thriller that tells its story with the use of rich imagery and breathtaking cinematography. This is excellent filmmaking and it does a good job with it's characterization. By that, I mean you shouldn't be rooting for the main characters, but you end up doing so.

The artsy style may turn a lot of people off, or even begin to bore them. I got right into it, and decided to go in for the wild ride. Stoker's mystery is slow while doing the build-up. It gives you the perfect amount of time to get to know your lead characters. The character development was top notch in this one. It makes it very well known that Charlie is off his rocker, but doesn't reveal all the goodies. It continues all the way to the chaotic and somewhat shocking finale where it all comes full circle, and the mystery is revealed as to where Charlie came from. I loved how they capped it off, and felt it was very fitting. I also have to commend the amazing performance. Mia Wasikowska is the film's heart and soul. Her performance is a revelation as India. Her twisted, yet vulnerable character surprisingly manages to be very sympathetic, and all credit goes to Mia herself for that. I couldn't take my eyes off her. It was very memorable. Matthew Goode is absolutely eerie as the mysterious Uncle. Those cold blooded eyes of his gave me the creeps. It was a masterful performance, and one I won't soon forget. Nicole Kidman made me remember why she is a former Oscar winner. Her unstable character had me on edge a little bit. Her monologue in the finale gave me chills. You'll resent her character, and even feel sorry for her at times. Final Thoughts: A refreshingly unique thriller to say the least.

The first is a waste of Nicole Kidman. They should've given her more space or throw her out completely. The second flaw is song that goes with the final scene.

I assume for most people that morally this movie wouldn't be an easy movie to watch as there appears to be no character of really any, ultimately likable disposition. But I can't say for sure the same thing about the younger generation some of whom may have a proclivity bordering on the sociopathic perhaps. Thus, it makes it difficult to assess this movie objectively in some matters and at times it seems almost repulsive. It's not that the cinematography was bad, it was shot with a quality technique that in fact was somewhat creative and experimental. There were many fascinating transition scenes back and forth with associated images and some surrealistic images that usually aren't used in most other feature films.Thus with all this preface out of the way, this movie was moderately and innovative visually speaking for the most part and for most of the movie until towards the end. Yet as much as it was innovative, it seemed almost too much, too cinematically challenging that almost reversed the background into the foreground, making the story narrative almost secondary. And as for the characters, they weren't very appealing, not that being bad is such a bad thing in and of itself. Yet depending on the judicious use of character development or using a more subtle, complex deviant personalities than those found in Stoker, the audience can come to admire such psychopathic behavior such Kevin Costner's serial killer persona in Mr. Brooks (2007), Paul Newman and Robert Redford's criminal characters of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis as sympathetic criminals in Thelma and Louise (1991), Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway in Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and of course perhaps the most famous of all adored psychopaths Anthony Hopkins - Hannibal Lector in The Silence of the Lambs (1991). Other such questionable characters have also received praise but in the context of an overarching movie that isn't completely as dark as Stoker such as Brendan Fraser role as an enforcer in The Air I Breathe (2007) or Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men (2007) or John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction (1994). Even with a much more focused character study, even the most challenging character can develop into an voyeuristically fascinating case study such as Michael Douglas's or Christian Slater's character's descents in Falling Down (1993) or He Was a Quiet Man (2007) respectively. Even so, in the horror genre, we can expect the evil reversal and accept it such as the young boy in The Omen (1976), the horror mystery starring John Cusack in Identity (2003) or the occult twister with Nicole Kidman in The Others (2001) or in real life subject matter and again starring Nicole Kidman's To Die For (1995)(maybe she's just good in these movies, but so good as not to be typecast which may be she's cast for these roles) or her perhaps her most usually set designed movie in Dogville (2004).Nevertheless, there is more identifying appeal with characters that we ourselves can appreciate and relate to as ourselves that we'd like to be, even with a dark side such as Saoirse Ronan great characterization as a young female trained to kill in Hanna (2011) or her a surrealistic side as a murder victim in The Lovely Bones (2009), Brad Pitt's demise in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), and of course the most famous of all horror films . For the most part, the moral balance for American audiences has much more potency in such movies as Black Swan (2010) or Another Earth (2011), Atonement (2007), or another Kevin Costner vehicle in A Perfect World (1993) and of course the most famous horror movie with Anthony Perkin's at Bate's Motel in Psycho (1960).As for Stoker, the characters' motivation and behavior in this movie doesn't offer enough background and reasonable psychological believability to make them even voyeuristically appealing. Instead the characters seem at times like the creative visual effects more background and less human as opposed to subjects to be manipulated to tell as a supposedly interesting story. While the over all storyline is decent and hangs together, the presentation and the sufficient depth just seem to be missing to make this movie into a really substantive and completely acceptable, sympathetically enjoyable.",Stoker

It goes flat not on the story but the narration. Lingering on the details to bring about frills in and around the center character India, intrepidly played by Mia, in fact works against the experience.Screenplay could've been polished a little to come in parallel with the titles, editing & music. Direction is wonderful and I'm in love with that striking cinematography. Locations are glamorous. The eeriness instilled in the plot makes me rate it a humble 6.9/10.Nicole Kidman is very supple with her portrayal as an estranged, callous mother, while Matthew Goodman caught my eye with his mien and air. His eyes talk a lot.The story is weirdly new and to sex it up, we have some kind of insipid familial relations drama involved, which voluntarily becomes the underlying message. I couldn't fathom some scenes, but the use of power of implications is ubiquitous. Although towards the end, everything gathers clarity, the style lowers the totality and cries for the moon. The climax beat me and had me questioning the filmmakers' intentions. Still, an engaging watch!BOTTOM LINE: A ""cool"" thriller which should be given a chance for its cast performance, story & execution.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? 51% YESProfanity: No | Vulgarity: Strong | Sex: No | Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: Strong | Nudity: Strong | Porn: No | Violence: Critical | Gore: Strong | Alcohol: Mild | Smoking: No | Drugs: No",Stoker
39,Reno-Rangan,Technically too much stylish than characteristic yet enjoyable,7,13 August 2013,"An another Korean director's Hollywood debut, the 'Oldboy' fame. Compared to his other movies it was not that impressive. The character India was a bit like the Jodelle Ferland in 'Tideland'. This movie was more stylish, the camera work was excellent, the cast and the locations were so good.This story was written by the 'Prison break' star Wentworth Miller. I was little disappointed in the characters which never came close to me an emotionally, but as a cinematically it was as awesome achievement. The portrait of character India was little let down after all her special abilities were so powerful than any others in the movie which were not used properly. All it was done was transforming one personality to another, that was the mainstream story of this movie.The whole movie presented in anime style, in fact frame to frame it was. It would have been at least near to a masterpiece if it was the traditional way of story telling than adding too much style. The character Charlie makes all the difference in the movie but seems borrowed from another movie especially Hitchcock's 'Shadow of a doubt'. Overall it was a nice watch, pretty enjoyable and don't expect much from the story and the twist.",Stoker
40,Rodrigo_Amaro,"That's it? Oh OK, then.",8,16 June 2013,"We have classical elements taken from tense thrillers of the 1950's and the 1960's, combined with the rhythm and sensuality of the likes made more recently. The final result is ""Stoker"", a movie that fools its audience into making us think we're getting something new with its over-stylish presentation. What's even more worrying than the excess in style is its pretense of trying to be more complicated than what it's not, and in the end you go ""That's it? Oh. OK then."" Perhaps it's an age thing. The older, more experienced we get the less impressed we get with some things. Not saying I'm old, but I'm certainly more aware of films like very few peers of same age, and that's why I didn't walk out of ""Stoker"" feeling more enlightened or surprised. There isn't much in there, really. And the more realistic (or cynical, if you prefer the term) you are, the less touched you get with this. I enjoyed it mostly because of the cast united and the mystery kept me fully interested. But the conclusion disappoints despite its unpredictability.Tragedy stroke in the Stoker family with the strange death of the patriarch (Dermot Mulroney), leaving behind a wife (Nicole Kidman) and a daughter, the sensitive India (Mia Wasikowska) to deal with themselves. It would be this way if it wasn't for the strange return of a parent never mentioned in family conversations: Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode). It's important to establish that it's more important we see him as the uncle rather than the brother-in-law, or the deceased's brother since he's unknown to India and he's trying to reach and know her, so he's uncle Charlie for the rest of the story. His sudden reappearance is a catalyst to many emotions - of repulse and estrangement to India, who isn't much of a sociable girl, and this new presence in her life doesn't seem to cause any good impact on her; some intimacy by the part of the widow - and also of strange happenings. We, like India, want to discover the truth about Charlie, or at least, know who he is and what's his intentions with the family. But much more than those, ""Stoker"" is far more than skeletons in the closet. It's about a girl's self discovery, finding a way through life. It's from her perspective that we see everything, a quite difficult character to relate with though. Not sure if it was a good or a bad point in making India such a distant and cold character, not only with the other people she communicates but also with us in the audience. Despite being relatively innocent, she is someone that doesn't generates any kind of sympathy from the public since she stays the same even with the introduction of this fascinating and intriguing family member. It takes a long while before some changes being made, touching her deep inside, revealing something hidden she never knew it existed (maybe just glimpses of such reality). Another doubt concerning her comes with Wasikowska's acting. She's different than the usual yet it's the same. A small variation from Alice but darker, closed. Neither the persona or the representation satisfied me, but it's the script problem in a way. Figures like her must be a little likable or give/show something worth endorsing. She has some few moments in which I really liked her; for the most part I hated every idiosyncrasy, move, manner, behavior, whatever, you name it.The other side of the coin worked wonders with me. Equally attractive and mysterious, Charlie, the enigma to be solved is splendidly played by Matthew Goode. His character is a perfect contradiction, interesting, handsome, seductive, charming, polite but also dangerous, sinister, repulsive, hidden in the shadows. It's a heavily clichéd role inspired in classic performances such as of Robert Mitchum in ""Cape Fear"", ""The Night of the Hunter"", or even another Uncle Charlie, the one played by Joseph Cotten in Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" (let's face it, it's the same movie but more violent). Although better played and developed in those other films, Goode makes something good (no pun intended) out of this character. He may lack the charisma of those class act performers but he sure have the looks, the mystery, the magnetic presence that attracts everyone around. It goes with less than 2 hours but it could make use of some extra minutes to develop the minor characters a bit more. We needed more scenes with India's aunt (Jackie Weaver), with the school bully (Lucas Till) and the only friend she has. I couldn't understand their relation exactly, I mean, he cares for her because she's provoked by everyone or he has interests on her? All we know is that the relation goes to a step further, when she decides to act, then comes danger! The amazing Park Chan-wook stylized this to a point of being an almost irritating movie. What's up with the symbolisms? What really happened or what didn't happened? Shifting transitions, dissolving one moment to the other, with no explanation or sense of order, none of those worked so greatly. He knows how to create a style, but such goes a little against the film, making it messy and complicated to follow. The latter, only in appearances. Once you get the real significance of the whole thing, the puzzle was more simple than it looked like. It's a decent first landing in Hollywood, sheltered by Tony and Ridley Scott as producers, but it could be way better. ""Stoker"" promised much when it was a trailer or a talk conversation between film buffs; the effect passes fast once you get the big picture. It's good, a little memorable, well-acted, and such triad is the best it can offer. 8/10",Stoker
41,leonblackwood,Boring and Uninteresting 2/10,2,1 September 2013,"Review: I really struggled to stay awake through this movie because its REALLY slow and its based around 3 characters who are not the most interesting characters in the world. It is quite a mysterious film were you know that something isn't right throughout the movie, but by the time that it all comes together, I just lost all interest. The ending didn't match the rest of the film and the director left it open for a sequel, like many films do nowadays, but I thought that the movie was going to be much better. The acting wasn't that bad but the storyline was weak and quite boring. Average!Round-Up: Nicole Kidman seems to star in a lot of movies in this genre nowadays, which suits her acting style but the films haven't been massive hits and I have found them all to be quite a drag. It's obvious that the audiences also found this movie to be on the down side because it made a lose at the box office, which isn't a surprise after watching it. It's says that its a horror on the rental website, but it hasn't got that concept at all so don't expect anything shocking.Budget: $12million Worldwide Gross: $9millionI recommend this movie to people who like there drama/mystery/boring films about a mother and daughter dealing with grief. 2/10",Stoker
42,jtindahouse,Made with class but little kick,6,11 January 2014,"Director Chan-wook Park is responsible for one of my favourite films of all time, the original 'Oldboy'. So I was extremely excited to see he had done an English language film. The man seems to have class in everything he does and 'Stoker' is no exception. His direction is top draw and he brings out brilliant performances from all the actors.The only real problem for me was the script. It was solid and I was shocked to hear it was Wentworth Miller's writing debut. But for me it just lacked a little kick. The movie is advertised as a mystery, yet nothing felt very mysterious to me. In fact until the very last scene thing's went pretty much exactly as expected right the way through. This was disappointing because the film felt as though it was lending itself to a big twist somewhere around the 3/4 mark. There were minor things here and there, but nothing that would leave your jaw gaping open.That aside though it's a good movie. Park's direction makes up for any script flaws and Matthew Goode and Mia Wasikowska give memorable performances even showing up the always solid Nicole Kidman. It's got nothing on the likes of 'Oldboy' but is still definitely worth a watch.",Stoker
43,freemantle_uk,A solid film filled with moments of greatness,8,3 March 2013,"Oldboy director Park Chan-Wook has come stateside to make his first American feature, and Stoker is a visually stunning, eerie movie.India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska) is an unusual teenager. She has a knack for the arts, hates being touched, and dresses in a very old-fashioned way. Her relationship with her mother, Evelyn (Nicole Kidman), is tense, and she often finds herself being sexually harassed by the jocks in her high school. On her 18th birthday, her father dies in a horrific car accident, and during his funnel she meets a man she did not know existed, her uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode). India does not trust this new man but slowly India and Evelyn are drawn to him, for different reasons.Park is known for being a fantastic director in his native South Korea and many of his movies are deservedly cult classics in the West. He moves to America by playing to his strengths, making a small character driven movie, filled with sexual tension and a creepy atmosphere. Every shot and camera movement was meticulously crafted, soaking you into the atmosphere. The camera moves with precision as we follow the action on the screen, and editor Nicolas De Toth did a brilliant job blending simultaneous events and flashbacks to the present.Throughout Stoker, there is a visual style that has similarities to Stanley Kubrick whilst employing the dark surrealism of David Lynch's work. There is a dreamlike quality throughout. One of the best moments that highlights this is when India and Charlie are up playing the piano together where no dialogue is needed, and it is left up to the audience to decide if the event was real or imaginary.Throughout Stoker, there are fantastic sequences with plenty of flair. Stoker is also a movie with substance, playing like a dark coming of age tale as India changes to be a more open and sexual person but also releases her inner demons. There are wider themes of nature versus nurture, asking which factor is more important in changing India's character. Most of the film is seen through India's eye, she is often present in some form, and there only a few scenes in which India is not around. The films progresses from India wanting to avoid her uncle to finally being brought into world of her mother and uncle, emphasising the change she goes through.The acting had a deliberately cool and distant quality to it. The characters are cold and repressed and show little emotion. It worked installing the distance tone and visuals that Park employs but it will leave audiences divided, with people either loving or hating the approach as it can seem occasionally stilted.Charlie act as different form of villainy, someone who is on the surface a smart and sophisticated man who enjoys opera, foreign languages and classic cars but harbours a dark secret. He is willing acts in his own self-interest and does whatever he can to cover his tracks. Charlie makes for more interesting villain, someone who does evil things but on the surface a seemingly charming man, making him a more compelling figure then someone who feels him needs to act out violently as often as possible. But Goode's performance is on the stiff side.Stoker is a very solid film that has moments of greatness. There are some truly excellent scenes and sequences in a movie that showcases Park's known skills behind the camera. Stoker may not be able to match some of Park's other works but it a film that will still please his many fans.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",Stoker
44,Stevieboy666,No masterpiece but what's with these 1/10 ratings!!??,8,1 June 2018,"Psychological thriller (with a touch of horror) set mainly in an impressive, large country house about the arrival of an unknown and mysterious uncle after the death of India Stoker's father.
Visually this film was incredibly well shot and made great use of it's gothic location. Certainly touches of Hitchcock. None of the three leads are American but all are convincing (I suppose Nicole Kidman does count as one, but I've often found that Australian/British actors can struggle with American accents). There's lots of suspense and intrigue, and the film never drags. The violence is pretty brutal. I did have mixed feelings about the end, without giving anything away but I felt that it wasn't entirely satisfactory.
Like my title says, this is no masterpiece but come on, guys rating this just 1/10. Really?? The majority of what I consider to be bad movies will get a 2 or 3/10, only the worst of the worst deserve a 1. And believe me I have sat through MANY bad films.

45,pixrox1,"Exactly who has innocence to be ""lost"" here?",7,21 March 2013,"The advertising campaign for STOKER centers around the idea that the story is one of lost innocence, and the posters suggest actress Mia Wasikowska as the person with something to lose. Maybe if she had been more convincing that the cartoon Alice in her widely-panned ALICE IN WONDERLAND effort with Johnny Depp, this concept would not seem such a stretch. As it is, her India character in STOKER seems guilty as sin from the get-go, even if she does wear archaic black and white saddle shoes and take piano lessons (her duet with the supposed non-pianist Uncle Charlie--of a Phillip Glass piece--is the one true highlight of this film). But as a life-long bird-slayer, as well as a kinky fetishist, India obviously is not portrayed as having an ounce of innocence to lose. Certainly India's mom, played by Nicole Kidman, or her late dad (Dermot Mulroney in flashbacks) are equally ""guilty."" The housekeeper and Aunt Gwen seem perfectly find in playing with the skeletons in the Stoker closet, so I remain at a total loss here.",Stoker
46,estebangonzalez10,Park's first American Film is a Must See,9,12 June 2013,"¨Sometimes you need to do something bad to stop you from doing something worse.¨I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed Chan-wook Park's first American film considering it hadn't received as much critical acclaim as his Korean films did. I liked Oldboy, but wasn't a huge fan like most people, but somehow I ended up being blown away with how artistic and well made this movie was. Park can take you to dark places and his movies can be disturbing. Stoker is no exception. Park creates a dark and provocative thriller that begins at a slow pace but the tension begins to rise as we get to the climatic and surprising ending. Park's film is very stylish, and I don't think I have seen better camera-work and editing in a film this year. I was blown away with the images and the twists that Park creates in this film. Stoker proves that it is not necessary to sympathize for any of the characters in order for the viewer to care for what is happening. None of these characters are likable, but Park creates such a dark and twisted atmosphere that I wanted to know what was going to happen next. The slow opening scenes were very stylish and gorgeous to look at. I was completely hooked with the story from the beginning. I was surprised to discover that the script was written by Wentworth Miller (the actor from Prison Break and Resident Evil Afterlife) because the story was pretty gripping. I don't know if it would have worked in another director's hands, but Park made the script look good. If this was Park's first American film, I can't wait to see what he does next. This film also made me want to watch Oldboy again and see what I missed the first time considering I was a much younger viewer. Park will definitely be on my radar from now on. India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska) has always been very close to her father, Richard (Dermot Mulroney), but has never connected well with her emotionally unstable mother Evie (Nicole Kidman). India isn't a normal teenage girl herself; she is socially awkward and doesn't like to be touched. She lives in a large family estate in a peaceful town surrounded by the woods. On the day of her 18th birthday, she receives the news that her father has passed away in a freak car accident. During his funeral, India is introduced to her Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), Richard's estranged brother whom he has never mentioned before. Evie invites Charlie to stay with them, and despite being attracted to him in some sort of bizarre way India isn't happy with his presence in their estate. Charlie seems to have some ulterior motives, but everyone in the family acts in a bizarre way. This isn't your typical family and everyone seems to have some disturbed troubled past. Charlie seems to be taken with India, but she distrusts his intentions. As the movie begins to unfold we discover some hidden secrets from the family's past.I've mentioned how much I liked Park's direction and Miller's script, but I also have to give credit to Wasikowska's performance. She gives a very strong performance as this troubled teen who is struggling to accept her infatuation with her estranged uncle. She has some very difficult scenes here and she delivers at every turn. She is the highlight of this film, although Matthew Goode has some great moments as well and some strange sort of chemistry going on with Wasikowska. The film finds a perfect balance between being disturbingly dark and beautifully stylish. I was really hooked with this thriller and would definitely watch this film again. Stoker may not be as raw and shocking as Oldboy but it still has its twisted and disturbing moments. Park's style may not be for everyone, but I enjoy his craft and artistic style. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Stoker

48,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Disturbing, well orchestrated shocker",8,8 August 2015,"Chan Wook Park's Stoker is a clinically cold, yet lyrically composed thing of beauty, a throwback to deliberately spacey, intensely characterized psychopath thrillers of the 70'smand 80's. Park is renowned for his classic thriller Oldboy, which is one of my all time favourites. Here he utilizes his immense gift for throwing style, music, menace and pathos into the pot, stirring it and producing just the right combination of each, for a truly memorable experience. Mia Wasikowska, an up and comer of great talent and beauty, plays India Stoker, a withdrawn, awkward teen with dark impulses and a shadowy, inaccessible demeanour. Following the murder of her father (Dermot Mulroney in an excellent cameo) under mysterious circumstances, her estranged uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode) reenters her life, and her mothers as well. Nicole Kidman turns on the ice queen vibe for her scary, Joan Crawford on PCP turn as India's mom. I've never seen someone exhibit such fear and malice at the same time. Kidman pulls it off in a performance that takes you by surprise. Goode is killer good as Charlie, a silky monster with pools of predatory menace for eyes, and a velvety, poisonous curtain of cool, that parts for some truly frightening glimpses at the ghoul lurking beneath. Park stages the violent, icily emotional scenes with a swooping, old fashioned eye that calls to mind the brutal spectacle of a Brian De Palma film. While the plot itself is fairly straightforward and not too out there, it's the style and execution (no pun intended) that make it such a dark treat. The incredibly paced, hair raising murder scenes float in a constant current of operatic music, long, lingering moments from the actors and a gut feeling that although we've seen plenty of psycho family flicks, this one stands out from the pack based on style and feeling alone. Well done.",Stoker

50,aharmas,Putting Greatness Together,10,28 March 2013,"After learning the director of ""Oldboy"" was making his American debut and that the title of his film was ""Stoker"" (association with a blood thirsty classic character), I was intrigued. I am happy to say that I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I am so happy that films of this caliber are still being made, and the story might be more of a tribute than an original take, but it's the directing, acting, and editing that elevate this way above most of the fare that now passes as suspense/thriller.Mia, Nicole, and Matthew are incredible. For the entire film I was wondering if Nicole could ever do wrong, and Mia continues to surpass herself. She is serious competition for Jennifer Lawrence and might even be a better actress in the long run. She has been memorable in ""Alice"", ""The Kids are Alright"" and ""Jane Eyre"", but those look like rehearsals for what she has done here. She goes from a moody, confused, and mysterious teenager to one formidable femme fatale. I keep hoping she makes a return appearance in the future so we can see what else she can terrorize the audience with.In ""Stoker"", we see how a troubled family goes from a tragic event in their lives to a situation that becomes so tense and unbearable, the end result will be catastrophic because no matter what evil will win. Throughout the story, people slowly decay into shadows of themselves and some mutate into true monsters. There is even an assumption this is all genetic. Hints are dropped throughout the entire film that nothing good will come out of this. When the evil uncle makes his entrance, he's always lurking like a predator, threatening, yet it is all seductive. Later on, we discover where it all started.The center of the storm is India, a mystery herself. Someone who is not attached to anyone in particular, except to her recently diseased father, and later on, with the help of flashbacks, we learn that might not even be entirely the case. Her nanny gives us an idea that this is no ordinary household, and the arrival of the stranger upsets the household in ways no one expected. Soon bodies start piling up, but here it is where this film departs from what we are used to.First of all, the marvelous Mia shows the transformation of the malleable teenager into something wondrous and intimidating. She is both attracted and repulsed by what her uncle offers. Her dark side slowly threatens her and the rest of the people around her. There is an amazing scene where there is a piano duet, and the beauty of the classical pieces evolves into an even more intriguing piece of music, a dance of eroticism and fear.It is a suspenseful, mysterious, and remarkable movie. It'd be a sin to give away its many surprises, but its best gift is how well put together it is. It never falters, it dares you not to look away, just like Charlie does. Be prepared to enter a dark and dangerous world where anything, even the ugliest things are possible.Once during the film I thought that this film felt like a collaborative effort by Hitchcock, Lee, Kubrick, and Carpenter. These people understand what good cinema is: Not a bag of flashy technology, but a fantastic mix of good writing, great editing, flawless direction, and always aiming to entertain and surprise its audience. ""Stoker"" is not meant to be an easy film to watch, but that doesn't make it less enjoyable or interesting.Five Stars!!!",Stoker
51,dalydj-918-255175,Dark family drama with such a rich visual intent,8,6 March 2013,"""Just the visual style that Chan-wook Park brings to the film alone is just magnificent to watch but add in the story of this strange Stoker family and a fun piece of entertainment is on the screen"" Most foreign directors who transfer in English speaking cinema usually go for big massive effect movies but I believe Chan-wook Park has made the right decision by keeping his normal visual story and adding it to this family story that is surprising at every turn. India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska)on her eighteenth birthday loses her father and at the wake she is surprised by the visit of Charlie (Matthew Goode) and uncle she never knew she had. The movie also turns into a story of love triangle between India, Charlie and her mother Evelyn Stoker (Nicole Kidman). Some of the rest of the movie is told through many flashbacks and family members who try to add some outside worldliness to the inner darkness of the Stoker family.The film is visually stunning from every minor detail in the clothing, sets and the full atmosphere that the film presents. The story does feel slow at times in some moments that seem to be style over story even if the style is very strong. The film has a movement that just worked for me because even with the weirdness of the film I just fell in love with both the characters and the many images I could remember clearly even after the film was over. The film is not too long and never feels longer then it has to. Some visual moments I could mention would be the piano scene shared by Charlie and India, Evelyn near the finale as she gives a speech of her hatred for her daughter and the many introductions of the past of uncle Charlie especially the truth about India's father.Mia Wasikowska plays the misunderstood India and while she starts off quite cold in character as the film progresses she becomes even stronger in her performance. She is one of the great actresses of her generation and this is just another example of how she can bring such life and purpose to a character played by anyone else would be dull throughout. Matthew Goode plays the creepy Charles Stoker and this is the best I have ever seen him on film. He brings pretty boy looks to the role but once more his revealed about the character he brings such life and excitement to the role that he nearly stole the show with his great chemistry with every other actor on screen. Nicole Kidman plays Evelyn Stoker and once again she knocks it out of the part. I have loved her career lately and this is another example of risks she takes when wanting to work with such respected directors. She may not have as much big dramatic moments as Mia and Matthew but every moment she appears on screen she makes a women who could seem villainies seem like the only good person of the strange Stoker family. Other actors who have less screen time such as Jackie Weaver and Dermot Mulroney make good impressions on the screen.Overall the film is very strong in many areas that make films great. The visual style of the film is not overblown but near perfect with many repetitive moments. Strong performances from the three leads and a great debut into English speaking cinema for Chan-wook Park.

53,RainDogJr,Another extremely cinematic masterpiece from Park Chan-wook,10,24 April 2013,"STOKER is a key piece in Park Chan-wook's filmography. It's his first American production, and that reaches a wide distribution in Mexico, but mostly is the only one until today in which he doesn't have a credit as writer. Nevertheless, the newcomer that begins watching the films of the Korean director with this one (there will be many for sure) will immediately notice the voice of an auteur, the beauty and perfection of each one of his shots, and his interest for exploring the violence of the human being. In my country, at least, the film was sold sort-of like a typical horror picture ""starring Nicole Kidman"". I heard a young woman after the screening I attended saying that ""it's horrible"". You know, maybe the constant sexual tension between daughter (Mia Wasikowska), mother (Kidman) and uncle (Matthew Goode) wasn't enough to get this girl's attention; or maybe she expected something faster, gorier, in the vein of the new EVIL DEAD (Fede Alvarez, 2013). What doesn't make any sense to me is the discredit of a scene that's 100% cinematic, with a simple yet beautiful symbolism: the father of the protagonist, India Stoker (Wasikowska), has given her each year, as birthday present, a pair of shows (we see how the shoes become smaller until the first present India got is shown). It's impossible and useless to explain a sequence like this one, so I just want to point out STOKER is something you have to experience/enjoy in the biggest screen.The writer of the film is Wentworth Miller, famous for acting in PRISON BREAK. Without a doubt he deserves too a huge recognition. Hitchcok is the obvious influence. It all begins with a death that could have been murder, and the arrival of a familiar, the mysterious uncle. When we have in our heads the whole story, well, it's just a brilliant, violent tale of pure horror, which focuses on an evil that almost comes within the genes of a person. So the script is great but still no other director could have achieved something similar to what Park Chan-wook did. Let's see at one moment, after it's clear for us that India and his father spent many time hunting together, a scene that shows these characters while hunting appears but the outcome doesn't. And while any other director would have shown us everything, a simply flashback to see what India used to do with her father, Park Chan-wook, on the contrary, perfectly understands what hunting represents for the India Stoker character. He understands the connection it has with her present, and certainly he's interested in exploring the resources that are unique to cinema. Park is a master of the language of cinema and STOKER just confirms that. *Watched it on 05 April, 2013",Stoker

June & Ward Cleaver Will Not Be Appearing In This Movie,5,15 July 2013,"Is it worth the slog through the long artistic flourishes, bizarreness and creepiness, as well as the murder and mayhem, to find out what's really going on in the film? I would say no.All of the leads are fine. As usual, Mia Wasikowska does a superb job as India Stoker, a very strange 17 year old who never seems to fit in till she finds her ""true calling"". Nicole Kidman is spot on as the sultry Evie Stoker, India's mother, and seemingly a true lost soul. The English actor Matthew Goode is diabolical enough as the psychotic Uncle Charlie.I guess my major problem with the movie is that I had to basically suspend any hopes that there might be cohesive plot elements here, that could possibly be believed. I was expecting the film to be less reliant on horror shock schlock, including the terribly bloody and macabre ending.",Stoker

India's struggle to cope with the increasing proximity of her new faintly menacing Uncle and his singularly odd behaviour acting as a dangerously volatile catalyst for this undeniably beautiful looking film's more majestically macabre elements!

57,brando647,Amazing Visual Style in a Darkly Entertaining Thriller,8,25 August 2013,"I'll be honest: my initial thoughts going in to this movie was, ""STOKER? As in Bram Stoker? So it's a vampire movie?"" For the first hour or so of the movie, I was inclined to believe it to be true because the character of Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode) is a strange man. He arrives mysteriously following the death of his brother at the home of Evelyn and India Stoker just after India's eighteenth birthday. He's a man of few words and seems intent on gaining India's permission to stay indefinitely in their home, and we never see him eating. Maybe that was a bit of misdirection director Park Chan-Wook was going after in his first English language film. It's an atmospheric thriller with heavy themes and a brutal nature. When Charlie first arrives in her life, India (Mia Wasikowska) is unsure of what to make of him. She's an introvert who had a special relationship with her father while never really connecting with her selfish mother, Evelyn (Nicole Kidman). Charlie appears to have a special affection for India from the moment he arrives but she keeps him at a distance and observes the bizarre reactions others have to him. Her mother is instantly infatuated with him, despite losing her husband mere days before, and her aunt Ginny seems terrified of him. Charlie comes with a dark secret and his past is something of a mystery. All of this soon draws India's attention as she discovers that she might share some disturbing tastes with her uncle.A lot of reviews I've read for STOKER make an effort to spill as few details about Charlie as possible, as if protecting some grand secret or ultimate twist in the film, but I saw Charlie's reveal coming pretty early in the film. I'll extend the same courtesy, though anyone paying half an ounce of attention will see it coming a mile away if they haven't already figured it out from the marketing materials. I will say that Matthew Goode is effectively disturbing. He's got a natural charisma that counters his character's creepiness. Those who know him well are petrified of him, and he's so calm and collected that you know he's got something evil about him. His broad smiles and sophisticated demeanor are an obvious front and his attentions toward his niece are creepy from the very beginning. India is almost as strange a figure as her new uncle. She's the odd student of her high school class, with no friends and the frequent target for bullies. Her mother couldn't care less for her, and India reciprocates. The only person India gives a hint of affection to would be their housekeeper, Mrs. McGarrick. India's got a dark streak of her own and it serves to bring her closer to her uncle over the course of the movie. With her bizarre nature, it's no surprise she reacts to the truth about Charlie as calmly as she does and even gives in to the chance at experiencing it herself.STOKER deals with some heavy themes, including brutal violence and incest. I don't see this movie sitting well with everyone. It's all handled very stylistically. I've never seen any of Park Chan-Wook's other films but I see why he is so well-respected in the industry. STOKER is a visual beauty. It's a lot of high contrast tones in both cinematography and the production design with the occasional red splash (usually for the obvious reasons). I also loved the editing in the movie. There are some sequences the movie that are just amazing dynamic in how they flow. A standout moment comes in the middle of the film when we start to learn the truth about Charlie: Aunt Ginny's visit. Or, more specifically, Charlie's visit to Aunt Ginny. Each frame in the sequence meshes perfectly with the next shot that follows, whether it is done through visuals or audio. I suppose the movie has more going for it in style than it does in substance. Despite the extravagant imagery, the plot itself is pretty simple. As I mentioned, I pretty much saw Charlie's big reveal coming from the moment he arrived on scene. Maybe not to the full extent as we discover by the end of the film, particularly in his history and why he's been absent from the family for so many years. The movie intrigued me, not because of some complex plot, but because of the strange interactions between Charlie and India. The cast does a phenomenal job in STOKER and, while the it does start to sag a little in the middle, it's a darkly entertaining thriller and a pleasant surprise in what has otherwise been a slow start to 2013.",Stoker
58,Sergeant_Tibbs,"Great cinematography, editing and sound design but the story leaves too much to be desired.",6,9 August 2013,"Although I can't much remember the other films of the Vengeance trilogy, I'll always love Chan- wook Park for Oldboy (sidenote: couldn't be less interested in Spike Lee's upcoming remake). It's a powerful intense film that stands above much of violent Asian cinema. Unfortunately, it feels more like Oldboy was a fluke. Stoker is beautifully shot, sharply edited and the sound design is incredibly intimate, but the story leaves so much to be desired that it's a frustrating missed opportunity. The film appears to live in some strange Tim Burton-does-Addams Family world filled with bland archetypes and clichés. For the first hour, there's no details about the characters given and it plunges us into their relationships and uninteresting conflict expecting us to care and the eventual flashbacks don't make much of a difference later either. The acting severely suffers for it too, feeling cold and melodramatic. Park is much more interested in directing the camera than the actors (granted, I've heard there was a language barrier) but I blame the writer.Instead of details and dialogue, it revels in imagery and symbolism, which would be interesting given a better context and subtext. Stoker belongs to the camp of films that jump to violence and sex from a small trigger of conflict of any kind. That assumed connection is frustrating and never feels sincere. However, some of the films thrilling and sensual effects are felt due to its great use of editing and photography, even if some shots don't feel like they cut well together, but they just feel hollow. Goode makes a good Norman Bates but I never bought his obsessions. Kidman feels wasted and Wasikowska feels straight from the teenage cliché book. I don't know what they were trying to say with that ending. It's no surprise that this is a script coming from a first time writer who thinks they're being original. Albeit, I'll probably still watch Park's I'm A Cyborg and Thirst when I get round to them. They look like they have better stories.6/10",Stoker
59,rivertam26,"Visually stunning, intriguing and provocative",6,19 March 2013,"I am a huge fan of Asian cinema and those who know my movie tastes know I absolutely hate Oldboy, Three Extremes 2 and Thirst all by Chan Wook Park who directed Stoker, his American debut. I do however love Nicole Kidman, Mia Wasikowska and have a thing for sexy Matthew Goode. And than that trailer came out headed by a supremely mean and powerful scene with Nicole Kidman followed by some truly powerful visuals and a questionable but intriguing premise. Well all I can say is that I'm happy I gave it a shot. Cause this is by far his best film. Stylish, visually stunning, surprisingly intriguing and provocative. I don't want to explain too much not that I'm sure I could but the basic setup is the lead character India played by Wasikowska's father dies and she is in mourning with her mother when her creepy Uncle shows up. Violence and incestuous tendencies ensue as everyones questionable motives are explored. What works about the film is that it's ultra stylish and because it's used in such a way it always makes the proceedings to engaging. The film is also powered by strong turns from Kidman and Wasikowska. Goode is a mixed bag especially in a confusing and forced scene with Mulroney. THe cinematography is the films real star gorgeous and seductive from the beautifully framed shots to the impeccable lighting to the unique angles each frame feels as though it can be framed as a work of art and thats how this films works best. Because beneath the surface it's just not as deep as you'd hope. The screenplay by sexy Wentworth Miller yes that Wentworth Miller from Prison Break is impressive but seems to skirt around the edges of having a real focus. Although always intriguing it sometimes feels a bit confused in it's ultimate direction. Is it a coming of age story? is it something more fantastical or supernatural? Is it just a disguised seemingly generic but twisted family drama? I can't offer any real enlightenment on those topics and I can't say that the film really asks any tough questions but I can guarantee you that you'll want to discuss and last but not least the direction from Park seems to have finally found it's footing he feels more confident in his first domestic feature and the results although not flawless is clearly way above his previous works. All in all it's really a different kind of film one well worth seeing. 4/5",Stoker
60,napierslogs,Visually telling a horror film with a downplayed story but cinematic pizazz,7,26 March 2013,"""Stoker"" is all about appearance. An elegant exterior covering up insidious actions and motives. The story begins with the death of India Stoker's father. A somber India mourns at the funeral while her mother livens it up with an interest in Charlie. An uncle India never knew existed. But the film begins with photography, after all it is all about appearance in every possible way. Probably to cover up the lack of story.India (Mia Wasikowska) is a mysterious girl. She has a preoccupation with death, a loner at school, but the apple of her father's eye. Evelyn (Nicole Kidman) isn't even mourning the death of her husband, and the immediate sense of her instability already makes her less interesting. We spend the rest of the film trying to figure out what's really going on with India and the handsome and stoic Charlie (Matthew Goode). The problem is their issues are fairly obvious and the reveal is so slow that we just start to lose interest after awhile.However, ""Stoker"" isn't about telling a story, it's about visually presenting the characters and their situations. First we have some brilliant colour choices, not only giving the film a gorgeous appearance, but throwing in colour symbolism to boot. And then we get the lighting effects, continuing to give the film a stunning look and guiding our eyes to where the characters are going – literally and metaphorically. And then we have the placement of the camera. Some angled shots seem weird, but this is accomplished cinematography at its finest. Every shot and every transition is a work of art.But don't forget that ""Stoker"" is a horror film. It has a very methodical set-up, concentrating on the aforementioned aesthetics and allowing us to enjoy the melodic piano score. It's not your typical horror film. It is more on the side of a psychological thriller but it has its moments of violence and gore. And then there's the theme. The permeating theme throughout the film is that of love — family love, jealous love, infatuation, sexual love and superficial love. They must mean that sarcastically; these characters are anything but lovely.Fans of ""Stoker"" will likely have a refined taste. I think this will appeal to those who appreciate the sensory elements of film, telling a story slowly and perfunctory, and feel like having some violence, gore and other horror elements thrown into an otherwise dysfunctional family drama. A strange mix for a strange film.",Stoker
61,maurice_yacowar,Evil runs rampant as girl comes of age,7,28 March 2013,"In Chan-Wook Park's Stoker the exercise of evil admits no possibility of innocence. Even the apparently virtuous characters are enthralled to the evil ones. The film's connection to Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt (1943) is obvious, incidental and crucial. Where Hitchcock shows the innocent confronting evil, perhaps catching it, but (some) surviving, Park's vision is of an irreversible evil that nothing can stop. The film is stunning to watch, beautifully composed, as compelling as Milton's Satan. Of course it has to be, for the representation of a creeping, uncontrollable evil. For the stoker also feeds the fires of hell. As the South Korean director's first American movie, the exposure of pervasive amorality beneath a slick, seductive, affluent surface makes sense. In response to this topsy turvy world, Park's credits scroll from the top of the screen to the bottom, in reverse of the normal. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com",Stoker

Funny, you'd never think he was a weirdo by looking at him... actually, I lie. This guy is a CREEP in big, bold letters.

65,joebloggscity,Stoker transfers Park-Chan Wook's imagination to an American setting,7,7 April 2013,"Before I start, I'm very well acquainted with Park-Chan Wook's work and am a big fan. After the wonderful 'Thirst' I got the impression before watching this that it was going to be a lite transfer of that vampire film to a US setting. No it was not.The director takes his style and imagery to an idyllic rich country setting in the US. We have a mother and daughter who have just lost the father of the family, and mysteriously a long lost brother had just appeared whilst others seem to be disappearing, so what is going on? Has he done anything linked to connotations to the film title? That's for you to be intrigued by or guess. It's beautifully shot, and the acting is very good with Mia Wasikowska great as the moody young lead lady whilst Matthew Goode is frighteningly good as the cold emotionless uncle (giving a performance not too different to his Ozymandias from Watchmen!).We see the characters seeming to bond and the story unfolds. Yet it's not one of the director's best. It's very intriguing but I don't want to give too much away. The last acts of the film weren't satisfying for me and let things down. Yes, the settings and the playful camera work are wonderful (and sometimes too obvious) and it is all quite original, but it doesn't grab you enough. Some will find it in poor taste however no darker than some of his other works.I don't know how to wrap up on this one. I thought it was fine but not too memorable. He's done far better and that's what he'll be remembered for best. Hope though he tries more out with of the Asian markets, but I still love his Korean works and recommend those ones to all.",Stoker

The central focus of the film is India who has lost her father in a car accident on her 18th birthday. She was obviously close to her father, but not close to her mother Evelyn. They invite her fathers brother Charles to stay with them in the aftermath of the death. The film is a psychological thriller and very slowly paced.

68,bryank-04844,"'Stoker' will leave you disturbed for days, but leave you coming back for more.",8,2 September 2015,"Since 2003, Park Chan-wook has been one of my favorite directors of cinema, as I saw his film 'Oldboy'. I was in complete awe of that movie and immediately had to find out what else he had done. Upon some research, I ended up buying 'Sympathy for Mr. Vengenace' and loved that flick. Since then I have tried to see everything he has made including 'Lady Vengeance' and his vampire film, 'Thirst'. Now, all of these films have been made in Korea with English subtitles, but Park now has made his first North American film title 'Stoker', and proves the prolific director still has what it takes to be at the top of his trade.I have no doubt that you will leave the theater creeped out, puzzled, and possibly terrified after watching 'Stoker' as Park has created a very suspenseful and incredibly eerie feel to this blood splattered thriller. I also did not know what to expect from the film as it was written by Wentworth Miller, the lead guy in the hit TV series 'Prison Break'. No need to worry, as with Park's eye and Miller's writing, this golden piece of cinema will resonate for years to come.The story centers on a teenage girl named India (Mia Wasikowski) who seems to enjoy other-worldly endeavors than the usual teenager. Her father (Dermot Mulroney) unexpectedly dies leaving her and her mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman) alone in a big house. At the funeral service, she meets her uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), which she has never known about, who has been traveling and working abroad for many years.As the day goes long, Charlie's attitude and mannerisms become very unsettling, and the tension between him and Evelyn is so thick, that you can pour it over pancakes. India knows something isn't right. Charlie then decides to stay in the house for a while, when their Aunt Gwendolyn comes over for dinner and tries to warn India and Evelyn about where and what Charlie really is. Needless to say, that is her last time on screen. From here we learn more and more about Charlie as we see India take a liking to him, although there are some very evil dark secrets buried with this family that shouldn't be let out.Miller took his cues and borrowed heavily from Alfred Hithcock's 1943 film 'Shadow of a Doubt', which has the same characters and the beginning of the plot line for 'Stoker'. And I hear that Miller is already writing a prequel to the film already. His screenplay is pretty good, but where the gaps are, Park takes over with his unusual and astounding visual style as we are constantly on edge and walking on egg shells. Sound effects are heightened for even the most minute noises, which made me squirm and sweat.The acting is exceptional all around here. Kidman does an amazing job as a mother who would rather shop than take care of her kid, and Goode might just win an award for playing the creepiest guy on film. His performance and the way he looks and acts around India is truly unsettling. And Wasikowski is the headline here as she plays an off-beat teenager with a sinister urge to perfection, but never really letting us know which way she wants to go. Does she want become a warrior or does she want to become the monster? 'Stoker' will leave you disturbed for days, but leave you coming back for more.",Stoker
69,Likes_Ninjas90,I saw the blood but not the beauty or the growth,5,27 August 2013,"The mystery of Stoker doesn't lead us to a climatic revealing point but dumps its revelation onto us as grisly as several of its gruesome murders. The setup is intriguing but the film is unbalanced by the self- indulgent gaze it holds over its perpetually stylised art design. A coming of age story and a family conspiracy of Hitchcockian proportions runs second to an arts show of strange and beautiful but thematically opaque imagery. The film is intriguing for the many reasons that hinder its script but it is also emotionally detached and its violence seems unnecessary, inconsequential and increasingly sadistic.Korean filmmaker Park Chan-wook is regularly intrigued by violence in films, having made the Vengeance trilogy, which included the hauntingly mysterious Oldboy. This is also the first film that Park has made in America and in English, courtesy of a first time script by Prison Break star Wentworth Miller. Miller has said that Hitchock's film Shadow of a Doubt was his inspiration for the film, which is fitting because Park cites Vertigo as the film that made him want to become a director. The disappointment then of calling the film insubstantial stems not only because of aspiring influences but the script's personal clout as part of the 2010 Hollywood Black List of the best unproduced screenplays. Perhaps a cultural division stopped the film from reaching the full potential because at times it evokes an outsider, looking at an American family inside a vacuum of time and space.Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt was about a man named Charlie who was on the run for ambiguous and sinister reasons and then attempted to hide within his own family. His relationship with his niece caused his motives to come unstuck. The premise is similar here. India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska) is an alarmingly remote girl, grieving from her father who has died in a car accident. She has a brittle relationship with her mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman) and becomes even more detached when her uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), her father's brother, insists on staying at the house. Spying on her uncle, she notices that he and Evelyn are growing more intimate. This is in-between the brief arrival of Aunt Gwendolyn (Jacki Weaver). After Charlie begins to follow India, they being to grow closer together, leading to some violent actions against some kids bullying India. Chan-wook is a great visual stylist but his persistence to inject his stylistic imprint onto the film hinders the narrative. The film is Gothic in both mood and form. The colouring is selectively muted, pushing clashing white and brown tones into the frame. The colour filtering inflicts a cold and immobile emotional state over India as she grieves. The conservative and low-key stylisation of her clothes also encapsulates her in a stasis of timelessness where she is not an adult but no longer a child. ""To be adult is to be free,"" says her voice-over in the film's opening. The colour is conceivably a reflection of her inability to connect emotionally with people on an adult level and make choices for herself. It's Chan-wook's lingering camera and the specificity of the images that gets the better of him. The film is over-directed and heavy-handed. There are close-ups of shoes, pencils, blood and spiders crawling up India's leg and the sound effects of a clock are deliberately amplified. Combined with strange narrative details, like India receiving her birthday presents in a tree, the stylisation's purpose seems solely to impede rather than reveal the film's wafer thin plot until the final quarter. The narrative is maddeningly cryptic and light on insight, particular when the characters posses few signs of an inner life. Nicole Kidman's Evelyn has no backstory, which limits her panting, breathless performance to only fire late during a gripping monologue. Jackie Weaver's inclusion lack distinction, an underwritten role that is as brisk as the film's desire for murder. With a character that is intentionally disconnected Mia Wasikowska has a visible intensity inside her character, but India seems emotionally inexpressive. Her character's arc is an extension of brutal and violent horror than of psychological growth. The film suggests that her increasingly violent behaviour is equivalent to a sexual awakening, as shown through the juxtaposition of a shower scene with the flashback of a murder. In reality, the film is about a girl who breaks from her family to become a more violent individual against cartoon bullies from a bygone era, and then an undeserving final target.

71,bshaef,A Really Bad Movie,2,17 March 2013,"Stokers sucked. The only interesting part of the movie was when a person in the row behind me fell asleep and started snoring. He was by himself, so no one had the nerve to wake him. Other than anticipating when he would come to his senses, the movie was pretty much terrible. I have seen some pretty awful movies but the last time I saw one where a member of the audience dozed off, was O Heavenly Dog that I took my kids to see. The only redeeming part of the movie was Nicole Kidman kissing the serial killer. She has more sex appeal in her little finger that most actresses do in their whole body.",Stoker

Anyhoo after thinking it was gonna turn into something supernatural for way too long I realized this was just a weird movie that made zero sense.How would Charlie know about India? Who was visiting him while he was in the institution to keep him informed? We never saw the parents except in pictures.How would Charlie know where the aunt was? She switched hotels unbeknownst to him. He's just magical or something?Charlie is a psycho killer and somewhat of a ""groomer""? How and why did he fixate on India from her birth? That means while he was years older than her he was thinking about her in inappropriate ways counting down the days until they could be together.Why did the housekeeper keep Charlie informed of India's life? She had no reason to do that. Also why did Charlie kill her and put her in the freezer when he buried everyone else in the yard?Why is India wearing saddle shoes at 18?!Why did the one dude who defended her from Lucas Till then turn into a nasty brute with ill intentions towards her all of a sudden?! How did he get on top of her after she seemingly kicked him to death? It seemed like Lucas Till was gonna be killed by Charlie but that storyline went nowhere.Why is no one around when she kills the sheriff?! Her fingerprints will be on the shears so when they find him they will figure out who killed him. Unless we are to believe she takes the shears with her?Why would Charlie be able to decide when he wanted to be released? He was locked up for a reason. Why would the dad go meet him on his daughter's bday? All he would have had to do is tell the institution to keep him there for another day then he could've gotten him after India's birthday.Why does Nicole Kidman keep getting lauded as a great actress when all she does is weirdo movies. She has very little range. Jessica Chastain could do every movie Nicole has been cast in but she'd do it so much better especially because she at least can move her face. Why does Nicole keep getting Botox when it actually makes her look older and less attractive? JLO is about the same age as Nicole-you wanna know the difference between the two? JLO actually looks really good and natural for her age...next to her Nicole looks old and weird. Nicole's eyes are always bloodshot and her lips are starting to look like Lisa Rinna's - the inside flares out.I wish I could understand this movie so I could explain it but I'm at a loss.Oh and what's up with the title? It could have been anything but they choose a last name that is synonymous with vampires and yet it has nothing to do with that.This whole movie is just too bizarre.",Stoker

Despite its inwardness, it is not dull; the dialogue is sharp and the change of scenes as well as the plot development is done skilfully.As we follow the interactions between the leading characters, certain truths begin to unravel which are supposed to make sense of it all, but the problem is they do not.The mixture of mystery with a rather strong supernatural element is not helpful; it can be a challenge to tell the difference between what is going on and what our characters imagine is going on. To this if we add certain sudden appearances, this film is even more demanding to understand.Therefore, whilst it has plenty going to wow the audience the presence of several question marks in key parts of the plot deprive this film of points.An interesting, engaging experience that leaves many why's unanswered.",Stoker
74,billygoat1071,Twisted Cinema,8,6 March 2013,"Stoker is a psychological thriller that you might not expect. It's not the usual type of the genre. The storytelling is in pure style and it features its terror in a completely twisted way. It's a weird cinematic experience that might stuck in your head for some time. It didn't offer much new to the plot but it creates a both melancholic and terrifying atmosphere to the picture which made it fascinating. What's more fascinating is the filmmaking understands the psychosis beneath it and it clearly shows them on screen. Stoker is quite peculiar but in a remarkably stunning way.The story is just simple but it is told very differently. Thrillers usually slowly builds the tension of the plot until it gets to the point that everything what's happening is not right. Here, it already shows the oddness of their lives. The only thing it does now is to explore what's happening to the characters and what they are going to do. The plot isn't really that complex but it's all rather provocative. It embraces the strangeness that is manipulated from the two Stokers. It's not ought to be scary or anything. It's all about taking the ride on their horrifying acts. These scenes are, without a doubt, bizarre and somehow disturbing.The film has a set of amazing talents. Mia Wasikowska has always been lovely and talented. She gives a sense of weirdness inside of her innocence which is perfect to the character. Nicole Kidman makes a great desperate mother. Matthew Goode adds some creepy mannerism to the psychotic Uncle Charlie. It's easy to get infatuated by his deceiving charms. The violence is a bit tamed for a Chan-wook Park film, but here, he aims more at the fortitude. He fills them with an impressively energetic style which helps executing its eerie. The gorgeous cinematography captures the melancholia of their world. Everything is just stunning.The story isn't really that subtle or original but Stoker is a stylishly made film that will give you a quite different experience. Instead of jump scares or whatever tricks that typical thrillers use, the film rather tests the anxiety of the audience in these strange haunting exteriors. The film is not trying to be innovative but the reason why it's interesting is because of its intense use of filmmaking styles. It leaves the clichéd modern thriller plot points for a while and it simply tells the story by exploring these people's little twisted lives. Overall, it's visually captivating despite of the horror underneath the surfaces and that what makes the film so appealing.",Stoker
75,rubenm,"Very original, but also a bit weird",6,18 May 2013,"Have you ever heard the sound of a breaking neck? If not, 'Stoker' is the film for you. It's not often that a killing scene is remarkable because of the accompanying sound, but in this film it is the case. 'Stoker' puts a lot of emphasis on the sound. The swallowing of wine, the sharpening of a pencil, even the brushing of hair - things that are usually soundless - can be heard very loudly in this film. It's not very clear what the director's intentions are in this respect. Perhaps India Stoker, the main character, has extraordinary hearing skills. Anyhow, they don't really serve a purpose. The extreme sounds are just a gimmick that gives the film a creepy, supernatural, Gothic feel. Another gimmick the film relies heavily on, are the fast cross cuts during some climactic scenes, accompanied by suspenseful music. The story is about a mother and her teenage daughter who, after the death of the father, are surprised by the sudden appearance of Uncle Charlie, the father's brother. A series of gruesome and violent events occur, during which the reason of Uncle Charlie's presence in their house becomes clear. 'Stoker' is not an ordinary thriller, because the emphasis is not on the plot. In fact, there are several events that remain unexplained. Neither is it a horror movie, although there are some mild horror elements in it. Rather, the film gets its strength from the general 'creepy' mood, and the beautiful and original cinematography. Towards the end, the film becomes more extreme, and director's Chan-wook Park's obsession with blood and violence becomes more visible. These scenes are in stark contract with the almost poetic start of the film. The fact that the very first scene only becomes comprehensible after having seen the very last one, is a nice touch from the director. India's words about 'flowers not being able to choose their own colour' get a very different meaning.....'Stoker' is a very original film, with plenty of beautiful and inventive film-making. But at the same time, it's a bit too weird and extreme to be really great.",Stoker
76,christophe92300,Great atmosphere,3,27 October 2013,"Stoker is the kind of pseudo intellectual masturbation professionals rave about, where a director and a writer are basically blowing hot air.Because if the glacial atmosphere is a hit, the plot badly lacks substance, so much so that after barely 45 minutes, you get tired of not seeing any interesting development emerge, especially as this story unfolds in a false rhythm favourable to boredom, which inevitably gains the viewer as minutes go. The narration is confused and the editing, sometimes sloppy, just accentuates that feeling, even though the transitions are often beautiful.As for the cinematography, it is painful due to too many camera movements that interfere with the action.",Stoker
77,dragokin,utter crap,1,6 July 2013,"They say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. So, if you think that murder is art, Stoker is a masterpiece. In this sense, i assume that the explicit gore scenes were highlights for the target audience.Stoker has a strong cast that delivers exquisite performance. The photography is excellent. As far as plot is concerned, someone even mentioned Hitchcock's influence.But all qualities fade away in the scene when the main character gets aroused when thinking about a murder she committed and masturbates. After that point there was nothing left to discuss and no artistic merit whatsoever.This is a vicious and dangerous movie.",Stoker
78,TheSquiss,"Mildly disturbing, lacking in horror & not very inspiring.",5,20 August 2013,"Something missed me in the marketing of Stoker. I viewed it reluctantly, acquiescing only when informed, in a strident manner, that I 'had to' by one who matters. What did I want with yet another twee, probably watered-down version of the Dracula (Bram Stoker, right?) story that followed in the wake of the Twilight saga, Warm Bodies and goodness knows how many other turgid, teen horror flicks? OK, I got that one wrong.Stoker isn't a great film but it is reasonably good, it's a heck of a lot better than many I've sat through to review, it isn't a typical horror and there's a dearth of vampires in the shadows.When India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska) discovers her father, Richard (Dermot Mulroney) has been killed in a car accident she withdraws further from her already distant mother, Evie (Nicole Kidman). It is clear that mother and child lack the warmth and closeness that India and her father shared, but the air becomes positively frosty. At the wake, her uncle, Charlie (Mathew Goode), of whom she was unaware, appears and attempts to engage her attention. Evie encourages him to stay and India finds herself infatuated and frightened by him in equal measures while her mother willingly falls for his charms.Stoker is a gently unnerving film that verges on disturbing through the audio and imagery that director Chan-wook Park (Oldboy, Thirst) blends together. An endlessly clicking metronome scratches at the nerves and successive scenes borrow elements form the previous one to link a thread or time uncomfortably. It is an unpleasant experience at times, not because it jars, but because Park knits it together so disturbingly perfectly.The triumvirate of principals is equally disturbing to behold, their own mannerisms and characteristics continually tugging at one's fifth sense. Wasikowska is a pale, ethereal freak, a washed-out cousin of an early 80s Winona Ryder character. Visually, she is far closer related to Professor Snape than to Richard Stoker and one cannot help but be drawn into her world though she would be very high on the list of school kids to avoid sitting beside in class.Kidman's Evie is another oddball. She is unable to bond with her daughter; the gooseberry in the familial relationship before her husband died, the pariah post-burial. She teeters between desperate mother and selfish bitch but is mostly lost to her own fears, insecurities and whims. It is a comfortable role for an actress who has stretched the cold characters she has become adept at playing but is no less pleasurable for the fact and, mostly, convincing.Goode, however, plays only a slight variation on a theme for anyone who is familiar with him from Match Point, Birdsong etc. etc. By the very nature of the film, we know that all may not be as it seems with him but as he strolls through Stoker he, um, ah And that's pretty much Stoker. It's good, it's mildly unnerving at the time but there's nothing much that sticks in the mind. I allowed 36 hours to pass before writing this review and I'm struggling to remember much.Not terribly inspiring, is it?

79,davidgee,Hitchcock meets Ken Russell,7,3 March 2013,"The storyline of STOKER is one Hitchcock would have been proud of. The style evokes 1960s movies such as Antonioni's BLOW-UP and Pasolini's THEOREM and some of those recent noir Japanese psycho-horror flicks. The cinematography is splendid, the editing crisp and inventive. Mia Wasikowska and Nicole Kidman are suitably enigmatic, and Matthew Goode's performance as the handsome but creepy uncle ( I was reminded of early Louis Jourdain roles) is hopefully a career-maker.The theme is decidedly retro: women in thrall to a dangerously attractive male. The script cheats a bit by withholding the ""reveal"" to rack up the tension. But the A-list acting and the elegant direction give this film a beautiful sheen of the kind we used to get regularly from Ken Russell. Well worth seeing.",Stoker

It is the writer behind this story Wentworth Miller I am talking about, and he did a really nice job in writing a strange, dark, twisted and mysterious piece.The strangeness of this films slowly reveals itself, it is slow paced, but that just makes it more strange, you keep thinking I have to watch carefully to know what is going on and what is happening, that must be why it is moving in this pace, but it is mostly to have the viewer see all the small details, the twist and turns, the imagery and the small sounds that all plays wonderfully well together.Early on you are told that she can hear small sounds, things that are far away and notice stuff that cripple and crawl. She is strange in nature, but the whole world around her seem a bit strange. It is this strangeness that in a way keeps you watching and fascinated me at least, together with the very nice filming, crooked shots, cut of parts and closeups of feet and staircases etc. The acting is good and all fits well in their roles, we only have to do with a handful of people that are in the film for more then 5 minutes, but they all fit in and do their part.I liked it for a lot of reasons, but the main one being the focus on details and the overall strangeness :)",Stoker
82,Al_The_Strange,"""Sometimes you need to do something bad to stop you from doing something worse.""",8,18 July 2013,"If you've seen the other films by Chan-Wook Park, then you'll know what to expect: creepy, moody, disturbing, violent, but with a delicate tone. Stoker embodies all these same aspects: it is creepy and moody, it gets disturbing, and there are a few violent deaths involved, but it's all done with taste and style. The film follows a little girl as she copes, grieves, and eventually grows into wickedness. The film takes on a pretty even pace; it's never too fast or too slow, and it takes its time to let the atmosphere sink in.The story, however, doesn't feel like it goes anywhere. Its greatest strength is in handling the characters and their nuances. The film is an intimate portrayal of the main character, India, and we really get to feel for her as the film tracks her thoughts, feelings, and even her sensuality. As far as the plot goes, it feels pretty thin to me, lacking in any particular conflict or direction. The film does cover a lot of the same ground as the director's other films: you can expect subtle themes of incest, violence, and wickedness to emerge.As expected, the film looks stylish, with decent photography, and decent attention to small details that help paint an overall picture and invoke a sense of texture and feeling. Editing is good. Acting is great from the cast: Mia Wasikowska does an exceptional job bringing India to life. Writing is not bad. This production has okay-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music is not bad either.The film is certainly stylish, morbid, and rather disturbing, on a level reminiscent of the director's previous efforts with Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, or Thirst. I don't think Stoker is quite as good as the man's other work from Korea, but it can stand pretty well on its own as a moody, character-driven thriller. I just wish there was more to its plot.4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Very Good)",Stoker
83,lathe-of-heaven,"Some nice style and writing, but sadly, a somewhat disappointing, shallow, and surprisingly UN-involving film...",4,10 August 2013,"A shame too... I KNOW that many really liked this movie and will almost certainly NOT agree with me (this review is currently rated at 2/8) It could simply be that this movie's particular style just doesn't personally resonate with me, but I felt I should share my genuine impressions of this film.I was REALLY looking forward to this one; I guess I was expecting something somewhat different, so that may be one reason why I was left so cold by this film. The reviews that I had read made it sound like a really sophisticated Psychological Thriller. But, sadly, in my lowly and wretched opinion, it was anything but...The primary thing that I found jarring and completely unacceptable were the paper-thin characterizations. The daughter as time went on was pretty good. But the mother was just a clueless airhead and the uncle was this smirking, cocky guy. TOTALLY 2 dimensional characters that I didn't believe for a second. Now, perhaps what the trouble was, is that this is the first American film for this director who has quite a good reputation for the type of Gangster / Violent Crime films that he has made before. I'm not sure that he really grasped the way American audiences would feel or perceive things in a film like this. This film needed something DESPERATELY that this director I felt just couldn't provide, and that is 'Subtlety'... This guy is definitely NOT known for this and so I do not feel that this is the kind of film for him.I think the overall idea is excellent; kind of a modern re-working of 'SHADOW OF A DOUBT' as others have mentioned here, but with a nasty and DEFINITELY modern 'twist'. However, the director for me personally just left me completely uninvolved and cold. It did almost nothing for me except leave me feeling that I had just seen something crude and distasteful. ***MINOR SPOILERS*** I actually turned the movie off right after the 'shower scene'; I found it extremely repugnant. I KNOW this is just a matter of my personal taste because there are a LOT of people who get off on things like that. But, just for my personal sensibility, the depicting of ANYONE getting sexual pleasure from seeing a person violently killed is highly disturbing and offensive. I'm just putting that in here, NOT as a criticism of others' taste, but for those who may happen to feel the same way.***END SPOILERSI then came here and thought I'd read the full summary to see what happened and when I read a little bit about her finding the letters and such, I thought 'Oh, well maybe this will just turn out to be a good twisty Mystery / Thriller after all...' So, I put the film back on and finished it. But, like I say, I think the idea behind the script was fine, but the execution just didn't fit it. To me anyway, a GOOD Psychological Thriller NEEDS to be done ***SUBTLY*** with shadings and intonations implied with a deft hand, and with a GOOD atmosphere and mood, something that this film I thought was COMPLETELY lacking. Now, for me, I would LOVE to see what David Lynch would have done with this story. Now, THAT would likely be a completely different animal altogether. He would have REALLY instilled a powerful mood into the film which it desperately needed. NOT the odd, meaningless, and to me anyway, completely unmoving 'style' that this director had.I gave this a '4' which is really higher than it felt to me; but, I try to rate films as objectively as possible and take into consideration that others may not be expecting the angle or slant that I would in a movie like this. I personally found it empty, crude, obvious, distasteful, coldly unmoving, TOTALLY devoid of ANY atmosphere what so ever, the characters paper thin and absolutely unbelievable, and the film ultimately ineffective...*** EDITHeh, I know, I know, I NEED to get a life : )Anyway, after reading Sgt. Tibbs review here, I just wanted to state that I STRONGLY agree with him and I feel that in a much more objective way he explained PRECISELY what I was feeling, but he put it across like a MILLION times better!PLEASE READ HIS REVIEW!He is absolutely right!",Stoker
84,TwistedContent,Beautifully Dressed Twisted Family Drama,8,15 February 2021,"I saw ""Stoker"" shortly after seeing ""Oldboy"" for the first time, and that was whole 7 years ago, it is a movie I've been meaning to revisit for some time now. For his first (and last, for now) english-speaking feature, acclaimed director Chan-wook Park directs the first script written by Wentworth Miller, the face of ""Prison Break"" series, and that's an interesting combo, if You ask me. Boasting a great core cast, artful direction, and sinister atmosphere, ""Stoker"" is a dark poetic and reasonably psycho coming of age story.After India's (Mia Wasikowska) father dies, her Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), whom she never knew existed, comes to visit her and her unstable mother (Nicole Kidman). She comes to suspect this mysterious, charming man has ulterior motives and becomes increasingly infatuated with him.
Wentworth Miller has come up with quite the cold and grim family drama, every character carries many demons, and they clash, exploring themes of obsession, jealousy, twisted family secrets. Revolving largely around emotionally confused and closed India, the story goes places that more demanding viewers will wind rather empty. It is one of those movies that might make You ask what's the point. A script like this found just the right director, for Park's cinematic skills and attention to detail elevates ""Stoker"" greatly. Aesthetical nature of this film is mesmerizing, photography is beautiful, and all kinds of camera and editing trickery is used to make to movie always visually alive and breathing. Under this dark poetry for the eyes, atmosphere is further strengthened by the weird and even psychosexual electricity between the characters, and the journey to their fates. The inevitable conclusion can be predicted. It is not a movie that builds until it explodes, but rather propels you to philosophize a little, and to ponder the muddled morale. Disappointingly enough, there are a couple smaller plot details that never get anticipated continuum.I absolutely loved the performances by Mia Wasikowska and Matthew Goode, both of them nailed it, conveying their emotional turmoil, and twisted fascination with each other. There is a scene where India and Charlie play piano together, probably my favorite sequence from ""Stoker"", emotionally charged, with a strong feeling of bizarre intimacy. Nicole Kidman had more of a supporting role, and a smaller character, which lacked some history, but there is one standout scene with Nicole's power too.""Stoker"" is a beautiful and bizarre beast, which might disappoint those expecting ""Oldboy"", lots of violence, or a game-changing twist. First and foremost a drama, it is a darkly brooding family tale and has the slight aura of an adult fairy-tale, largely thanks to the colorful, doll-house like approach to production design.",Stoker
85,asc85,Terrible,2,28 December 2013,"As a big Chan-wook Park fan of ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" and ""Lady Vengeance,"" I was looking forward to this film despite the lukewarm reviews it received. The critics who rated this even as ""fair"" were far more generous than they should have been...probably blinded by the reputation of the great Park.Yes, Park is an extremely stylish director. But other than that, the film was horrible. The primary reason, I think is that you're a Korean director with Korean sensibilities, and you just can't make an American movie, and a movie in a language that isn't your primary language. It just doesn't work. It's like the disaster of Wong Kar Wai making ""My Blueberry Nights."" I can tear this film apart in 99 different ways, but rather than wasting my breath, I'll just leave it at what I just said above. Please Mr. Park, never make an English-speaking movie again. Then again, after this disaster, who on earth would hire him to do something like this again?",Stoker
86,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,5,9 June 2021,"Cheerio from my local.I dig a lot of Park's work; Oldboy is a masterpiece as is Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance...I even enjoyed the looney, I'm a Cyborg, But That's Okay. He's good at his craft, but he isn't beyond critical review. Stoker, is high on visual style...each shot a pondering photograph - colors balanced - framing just right...a feast for the eyes. Once you're done saying, ""wow, look at how pretty it all is,"" you're going to want an actual movie.Here, we have Kidman, who once again (or maybe always), plays an emotionless Ice Queen and recent widow. Her daughter, India, is played by someone who resembles Sara Gilbert from Roseanne. The pair don't do much except rattle around a big house ignoring each other in a way that only happens in arty movies about dysfunctional families.India struggles with undiagnosed Autism and the kids from school bully her. She is obsessed with bowling shoes and reminisces about hunting small animals with her father. It's all very poetic.Soon, an unknown uncle shows up and he isn't who appears to be. Both India and Kidman are mildly attracted to him and...but, surprise! He's a psychopath...and a bland one at that. This movie bumps along at a slow, pondering pace working overtime to avoid building any sort of tension or sympathy for anyone.Whether they live or die or get married or end up in prison - who cares.The movie looks great, but it's a big bowl of unsatisfying hot ham water.Cheers.",Stoker
87,dvc5159,O what a tangled web they weave...,7,1 March 2013,"Weeks ago we saw the release of two movies: the Arnold Schwarzenegger actionier ""The Last Stand"" and the Steven Soderbergh-directed ""Side Effects"", which were hugely entertaining by their own rights. The former was the English-language debut of South Korean filmmaker Kim Ji-Woon, and the latter was a faithful homage to Alfred Hitchcock and his techniques for suspense.Now comes Park Chan-Wook's ""Stoker"", the second South Korean director this year to make his English-language debut, and a delicious tribute to Hitchcock. Using Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" as a blueprint, Park and writer Wentworth Miller (yes, that very one) weaves their way through many suspense pastiches, and yet, it is a stunningly effective watch.Miller's characters are, from the moment we first see them, are not what they seem. Tensions are boiling under the surface. India (Mia Wasikowska) looks completely pale, stares into space chillingly, and is so withdrawn towards certain people after her father dies, that you wish she has a pet.. oh wait, no. Her mother (Nicole Kidman) wonders about her predicament as to why her daughter, close to her father but not her, is so distant away from her that she seeks affection for herself to ease her grief, subtly, desperately. Then into the mix comes India's long lost uncle, Charlie (Matthew Goode) who charms his way into both women's hearts, and his smile and chilling eyes have quite some stories to tell.The audience today is used to thriller pastiches. They think they know what's going to happen, and they play a guessing game with each other. Park and Miller knows that they think they know, and they turn the tables on the audience, forcing them to think and guess for themselves what exactly will the outcome be. We think we know the characters, but something else is missing. Just when you think you know the shortcut, a detour appears from nowhere. Like a spider weaving a web around its prey, Park and Miller go for the kill.Wasikowska is good in a departure from her previous roles, as a silent, distant, mysteriously creepy, and yet sombre girl who drifts around looking aimlessly for people to trust, and looking cold while distrusting others. Nicole Kidman is also good as the grieving, desperate mother who looks like she is simmering to a boil. The show belongs to Matthew Goode. His charisma and deliciously creepy performance nails the role. As his ""Uncle"" Charlie character seduces his way around both mom and daughter, twists and dark plots began to unravel between the trio.Miller's screenplay is good but not great. It is written well enough, has affection for his characters, and plays a good guessing game with the audience. The film's best aspect is the brilliant direction by Park Chan-Wook, famous for his ""Vengeance"" trilogy. Park complements the twists and deceit with strikingly beautiful, haunting camera-work and visuals. He even brought his usual cinematographer, Chung Chung-Hoon on this film, and it works wonders. Every frame is beautifully and lovingly crafted, from blood splatter onto white flowes, to flickering lights in the basement, to the meticulous editing by Nicolas De Toth that brings the film to an aesthetic, more sensual level. Complementing these is the music. Oh the music. Clint Mansell, always an interesting composer, again works his way with Miller's material and Park's style and blends the two together with his ominous, brooding and atmospheric score. Credit should also go to the great Philip Glass for composing that beautiful piano solo. Vintage Park Chan-Wook, turning moments of horror and violence into images of stark beauty. On a technical level, the film is brilliant, and gives the film much credit then it initially has.This is a film that makes you guess what's gonna happen. However, it gives you more than the satisfaction by actually making you think harder. It isn't mind-blowing, but it is supreme, intelligent entertainment, to make your brain do some work. All due praise to Park Chan-Wook for a stunning Hollywood debut and a promise for better things to come.",Stoker

I was disappointed at first to see Mia W play such a subdued, unresponsive character (that changes!), though Nicole Kidman seems right in her element. Good work by Matthew Goode as insinuating Uncle Charlie. The script is sometimes flimsy and the characters paper thin, but there's plenty of atmosphere and suspense, up till the very last spray of arterial blood; the camera-work and color-coded production design are impressive, maybe a little distracting at times. Film buffs will be reminded of ""Shadow of a Doubt"" and, of course, ""Lolita""; oldsters may think of Edward Gorey and Shirley Jackson's creepy classic ""We Have Always Lived in the Castle."" I'm sure it looks great on Blu-ray, but they show it a lot on cable these days. More style than substance, but very effective on a visceral level.

89,jackasstrange,"Really Disturbing, with a message that can be easily missed",7,8 December 2013,"Arguably one of the most disturbing psychological thrillers that came out recently, 'Stoker', by the great Chan Wook Park, who made one of my favorite films of all time, 'Oldboy' (A must watch!). The film starts out strong, with a carefully treatise in the character India(interpreted by Mia Wasikowska) , the protagonist of the film. India is such a weird girl, and this you can assume in the very first twenty minutes. Her mother (interpreted by Nicole Kidman) looks even weirder than her.As i said, in the beginning we have a superficial idea of who is India. Nice. But then, later in the film, the things start to become very obscure and rather nonsense after the introduction of Charlie, India's uncle, the brother of his recently dead father. The fact that he appears just after the decease of India's father is what distract us from other events and i must admit that when the twisted reason of his journey is really reveled, it is not really surprising. There is a lot of things even more shocking than that which happens in the film earlier, so then this so expected 'twist' is revealed, I was like a 'whatever' about it. Not a big deal.Also, there is some non sense things that happened in the film. Nicole Kidman's character is as obscure as it can get, you know nothing about her in the beginning and still not knowing in the end. You don't understand why she burns her husband's things into the house, for example. It has some symbolic meaning, but it's just nonsense upon a superficial view.And talking about views, this film has really stunning cinematography, also very stylized. I kinda liked it. The initial and the ending shots were the most beautiful in my opinion, despite their horrible nature. The shadowy lightning adds a very dark atmosphere to the film, and has an impressive impact in those who are watching it. A watchable disturbing film, that may distract you from his real intentions. 7.2/10",Stoker
90,x_manicure_x,Wasted opportunity for Korea's most inventive filmmaker,6,14 August 2021,"Park Chan-Wook did what he could to turn a mediocre screenplay into a fascinating psychological thriller, but the end result remains rather subpar. The decadent sensuality of the story is perfectly complemented by the stylish production design, slick cinematography, and beautiful music. Park fills the long silences with vivid imageries and sophisticated visual storytelling to communicate what the clichéd dialogues and situations couldn't. However, everything somehow feels cold and distant despite the beautiful visuals, resulting in a thriller with no tension or intrigue. This sense of emotional detachment is also emphasized by the stiff and mechanical performances of the actors. Possibly an artistic choice to point out the emptiness of the characters? It could have worked for some films, but in this case, it just added up to the feeling of being watching a straight to TV movie.",Stoker

When she suddenly loses her father in a crash, in the same way appears in the house her uncle Charlie about she will learn why he is there and the reason why she lost her father.It is a slow film, looking if there are many sequences are just for stalling and to fill the 99 minutes, I made the mistake of watching it at night and almost asleep.First of all, when India has seen that head in the freezer could not said anybody about it, the police, or to go to her mother to say, ""Mother, Hello, it's a frozen head in the freezer."" Then Charlie, who turns out to be a killer and his favorite weapon is his belt? You might find something more original than that. Although she lost her husband Evelyn hardly seems affected by this, and more, during a dinner she says better not to talk about him anymore. Since when become India from an ordinary high school girl who just turned 18 years old a criminal who may handle so well a hunting gun? Especially as she could kill Charlie from a reasonable distance and her mother was very close to him. I do not understand how this film has a note so high when there is nothing to see?

92,akash_sebastian,Chan-Wook Park's Much Awaited English Debut is a Terrific Thought-provoking Endeavour!,7,15 July 2013,"Chan-Wook Park's much awaited English debut, 'Stoker', is gripping and stirring from beginning to end, as expected. Park has already left a strong and lasting impression on Korean Cinema, right from 'Sympathy for Mr.Vengeance' to 'Thirst', including his all-time best and the hauntingly beautiful 'Oldboy'. 'Stoker', clearly dialed down a couple of notches (in terms of violence and twisted truths) for the much-too-conservative English audience, is still a remarkable piece of work.With a story written by 'Prison Break' star Wentworth Miller, Park's foray into English Cinema is a fascinating psychological thriller which, like its lead character 'Charles', hides its true intentions quite well. It has a wonderful take on Hitchcock's 'Uncle Charlie' character from 'Shadow of a Doubt'. The most beautiful aspect of the movie is its chameleon-like charm; when you think that you've almost figured out a person/thing, the movie later shows it in a completely different light. The tension is nicely built, and the suspense is well maintained.Park's attention-to-detail is sublimely brought onto the screen by his regular cinematographer, Chung-Hoon Chung. Chung's crisp and beautiful camera-work only adds to the beauty and poetic nature of the movie.Mia Wasikowska is brilliant and captivating in her portrayal of 'India Stoker'; I've personally liked her movie choices till now (except for the 'Alice in Wonderland' blunder). She adds a likable innocence, and charm, to her character. Mathew Goode was surprisingly good in his portrayal of 'Uncle Charlie'. Nicole Kidman was good, not great in her supporting role.All in all, a terrific thought-provoking endeavour.",Stoker
93,noahgibbobaker,Short review.,6,19 December 2020,"It's been quite a while since I watched Stoker, the day after I saw it I forgot almost everything about it.Park Chan-Wook has made some incredible, twisted films in the past and they're what Stoker wants to be. It's not as disturbing as any of his other works and it's not as well made. There's only one scene I think is great, the duet piano scene. Mia Wasikowska was quite good as well, she starts off a bit inconsistent but she does a decent job.All of the characters are really dumb and make non-sensical decisions to progress the plot. This is also an excessively tropey film using just about every ""horror"" trope you can imagine (even though stoker is far from a horror film).The first half of stoker is kind of intolerable and the ending isn't satisfying in the slightest. It feels as if Park Chan-Wook was too caught trying to make a Park Chan-Wook film.",Stoker
94,Hallelujah289,"Intriguing, unique, great editing style",8,13 June 2021,"Very art house editing style kept me intrigued. Mysterious storyline threw several curveballs and red herrings (such as the title). Did not particularly know where the story was going but enjoyed the journey. The final scene and Mia's character India was somewhat disappointing and took the film into a fantasy type hyperbole genre. I wish they had brought the story down to earth a bit more.Twisted, seductive, contemplative and horrifying, this is a unique film that is done with much skill. I wish it was a slam dunk but there are many worthwhile aspects about it.7.5/10 but rounding up because it's a unique one.",Stoker
95,mistoppi,Disturbing and fascinating,9,20 May 2016,"Stoker has been on my watchlist for so long I don't even remember what made me interested in it in the first place. I'd say it's because of Park Chan-wook but I'm not so sure if that was the original reason for that. However, now that I haven't really written about movies for a while I thought I'd watch something and decided to go with Stoker.The story is astonishing, and so is the structure. The whole film is somewhat creepy from the beginning, but it's not so straight-forward with it. The film begins as ""muted creepy"". While the audience sees that something is clearly up with Charlie, the audience doesn't necessarily know what it is. He seems normal, but we've all seen movies, we know he isn't. It's just hard to realise before it's shoved into our faces and we know. Also that really disturbing atmosphere is enhanced by weirdly intense scenes. They don't necessarily need to be that intense, but they are, and that helps create the ambiance of the film. Also while parts of the ""plot twist"" were easy to predict, some of them came as a total surprise. They definitely were disturbing twists, just like in Oldboy, but still at least partly delightfully unpredictable. Somewhere during the film I forgot that it was Wentworth Miller who wrote this. Either the story is similar to what I'm used to from Park Chan-wook or his directing just made it look so clearly like his movie, but I kept forgetting who actually wrote Stoker. Visually this movie is just as enchanting as Oldboy or Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. It's marvellous. It's unconventional, yet every shot seems to be beautiful, even if they are extremely gruesome. Chung Chung-hoon is an excellent cinematographer. Stoker goes to same category with other Park Chan-wook movies I've seen. It is gruesome, disturbing yet extremely fascinating. If you like films like that, Stoker and Park Chan-wook's movies in general are the right films for you.",Stoker
96,nesfilmreviews,"Park Chan-wook's American debut is well-done, but ultimately disappointing.",6,4 June 2013,"Park Chan-wook's latest is a seductive slice of suspense titled ""Stoker,"" and it is carried with some unexpected supernatural bravura. It's not understated to say moviegoers' were thrilled when director Park Chan-wook, director of the legendary ""Oldboy"" (2003) and ""Lady Vengeance"" (2005), announced he was making his first English language feature film. Park is a truly talented director, a visual stylist with a flair for mystery. He is best known on these shores for his notorious, visceral, and character-driven 'Vengeance Trilogy'. Unfortunately, some American viewers familiar with his work, accompanied with their lofty expectations, won't get what they might have expected and hoped for.India (Mia Wasikowska) is an emotionally distant 18-year-old living with her mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman) in a sprawling mansion somewhere in the Deep South. She is mourning the recent death of her father in a car accident, and she was not prepared to lose her father and best friend Richard (Dermot Mulroney) in a tragic auto accident. The solitude of her woodsy family estate, the peacefulness of her tranquil town, and the unspoken somberness of her home life are suddenly upended by not only this mysterious accident. Then there is the sudden arrival of her Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), whom she never knew existed. When Charlie moves in with her and her emotionally unstable mother, India thinks the void left by her father's death is finally being filled by his closest bloodline. Soon after his arrival however, India comes to suspect that this mysterious, charming man has ulterior motives. Yet instead of feeling outrage or horror, this friendless young woman becomes increasingly infatuated with him.Technical achievements are almost nullified in large part to a pair of mitigating factors -- the first of which is Wentworth Miller's compelling, yet flawed screenplay. The fact that the most sympathetic people in the film are dead before it even starts doesn't help. Elegant direction helps to elevate a wearisome story line, but the cast plays things a bit too cool for comfort in ""Stoker""- a morbid inversion of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" (1943). Thematically, Park's eerie domestic drama fits nicely into his criterion, though its distinctive lack of sympathetic characters keeps us at arm's length when we should have a sense of being emotionally invested. While Wasikowska is a talented actress, she's curiously flat here in her role as India. The potential for a complex, distressed protagonist is present, but the progression you're waiting for never quite comes. While it's understandable that India might seem emotionally distant following such a trauma, but she overplays the disaffected nature of her mourning, that it blunts her story's emotional impact. Likewise, her character's frustrated and secluded mother never comes across as remotely likable. Miller's sense of pacing plays well to Park's strengths in sustaining tension -- ensuring that the audience remains engaged--and the major reveals are well hidden by Miller, as he skillfully plays his cards close to his chest. The overall result is a nerve-racking Hitchcock riff, and in its own right, is well made and certainly respectable. However, all of which contributes to the nagging idea that ""Stoker"" doesn't truly know what it wants to be. The story seems to have been pushed and pulled in a variety of directions by different parties. The film feels 'tainted' by Hollywood-a movie that is well polished and yet restrained, and nothing close to resembling a traditional South Korean thriller. A film that is worth the watch, but falls short of expectations and being truly memorable.",Stoker
97,danew13,The Adams Family without Comedy,6,13 June 2013,"Admittedly you don't know what's going to happen in this film until halfway through it. And you would never guess the ending. But I couldn't help thinking Stoker was a non comic version of the Adams Family.I mean all the characters were there, at least at the start.But the most tedious to watch actor was Mia...playing Christina Ricci's role. The entire time she seemed to be on grass or some medication. I found it quite boring seeing her floating around the estate for more than an hour in some sort of daze.Then there's the nut case incest minded uncle who shows up and then shows Mia what she really wants, while coming on to her mother Nicole Kidman.This slow paced monotonous production may suit some, but until the climax you can hardly keep from chuckling.",Stoker

Someone ought to revisit and study the classics and until such time, apply for a job in the food service industry. It is obvious from the get-go that the girl and her uncle are psychos, so why limp around aimlessly for two hours getting a point across that couldn't have been made more clear already 10 minutes into the film? Is having a plot too much to ask these days?3/10",Stoker
99,RockPortReview,This a pretty awesome film!,10,14 May 2014,"""Stoker"" is famed South Korean director Chan-wook Park's first English language film. He is mostly know for his Vengeance trilogy and the cult favorite film ""Oldboy, which is getting an American re-make by Spike Lee. Park's films are intense and meticulously crafted. They are usually pretty violent and push the limits all while being character centered and beautifully shot. ""Stoker"" delivers the goods with a bizarrely Gothic tale of a young girls coming of age in a rich New England family Starring the magnificent Mia Wasikowska as India the only child of Richard (Dermot Mulroney) and Evelyn Stoker (Nicole Kidman). India is quite the interesting character from the onset as the credit appear over freeze frames of her doing things that become more apparent at the movies end. She wears clothes very unique to her generation and although she is very pretty and ""normal"" looking she is and outcast at her high school. She is quite introverted has her own sense of style. There are many things about her that lay just under surface and her arc throughout the film helps her realize who she is destined to become.India's father Richard is supposedly a wealthy architect who at the start of the film dies in car accident on India's 18th birthday. At the funeral India notices a man who turns out to be her world traveling uncle Charlie (Richard's brother). Charlie seems to have a very strong interest in India as he frequently approaches her at the reception held at the Stoker's mansion. Charlie, played by Matthew Goode, is a hansom and charismatic man who's mysterious appearance goes unnoticed by most of the guests. Evelyn only knows that he has been traveling extensively in Europe for some reason or another and know nothing of his past.Evelyn is played brilliantly by Nicole Kidman and deserved a lot more screen time than she actually got. Evelyn is a bored rich mans now-widow who seems to have no real purpose in life or reason for getting up in the morning. She is an absent parent who gets no respect from her daughter. The introduction of Charlie into their family (who now lives with them for undetermined amount of time) does give her a sort of renewed vigor. Although like in Nabokov's ""Lolita"" Charlie only gets close to Evelyn to be able to get closer to India.India is not frightened by Charlie even after the disappearance of their maid Mrs. McGarrick and then Aunt Gwen, who stops by unannounced for a very awkward dinner. India is intrigued by Charlie and something inside her opens up, something dark but also something that feels right. Later that night India meets up with a boy from her class and when things start to go south Charlie is there and they share in something that is both wrong and exhilarating. This then leads us to the shower scene with India and a look inside her mind and how she feels about what just happen.India does eventually find out about Charlie's hidden past and his plans for the future. She needs to free herself from her toxic family and a create a life for herself, whatever that may be. Charlie's obsession eventually boils over and when he threatens Evelyn, she must make a choice. India is able to escape her family, but deep down she is what she is.Director Park crafts a beautiful looking film from top to bottom. The atmosphere he creates as well as the photography are simply breathtaking. Not to mention the awesome special effects work by Craig and Everett Byrom and company. OK, enough with the love fest I'm having for this movie there are a few drawbacks. The script could have been a little better. The story itself is kind of weak and melodramatic but with such great talent all around it does pull off a pretty decent film. ""Stoker"" is currently available on many formats such as DVD/Blu-ray/On-demand, etc. So see it!",Stoker
100,daggersineyes,Don't bother with this one.,2,27 July 2013,"I couldn't recommend this film to anyone. It's a shame because I wanted to like it. The cinematography was beautiful and the opening scene was intriguing but it went downhill rapidly and stayed there. It wont appeal to horror or suspense fans because there isn't any. Fans of good drama can look elsewhere as there's none of that either. And no action, awesome scenes of violence or even romance. So.... who exactly is liking this mess is beyond me.Yes there are some pretty scenes & camera shots but really that's all there is. The plot is wafer thin and the acting by all three main characters is awful. Jackie Weaver was a breath of fresh air but sadly her screen time was tiny. All of the characters, apart from the one played by Jackie - are bland tho slightly irritating and have nothing about them to like or relate to. I couldn't raise any interest in any of their fates. In summary, the whole film is tedious and boring. Really.... really ... astoundingly boring.The director has a great reputation and some of his work is fantastic. I think that's really the only reason people are praising this stinker. It's like the emperor's new clothes - everyone feels obliged to pretend it's awesome when really its clearly just a boring trite film about nothing.I gave it a couple of points for some of the photography. Other than that I got nothing.",Stoker
101,bushtony,Crafted and Considered,8,6 June 2013,"Some films are hacked out, some films are hammered out, and some films are crafted. STOKER gives the sense and impression of being one carefully crafted and considered piece of work.For his US debut Korean director Chan-wook Park dispenses with his Asian Extreme inclinations and instead opts for a slow burning modern Gothic exercise in creeping unease and simmering suspense. His reputation for sylised violence, gore and punishing vengeance are put on the back-burner here and what we get is an unsettling mystery flick with a nice line in fragmented personalities and elegantly disturbed family dynamics.Filmed and framed with great detailed beauty, painstakingly assembled and executed with visual and creative precision, it's a sleek and seductive engine that drives this movie along. The downside is that it reflects in effect the dark empty hearts of the three central characters by being both devoid of warmth and emotionally cold to the point of being clinical. So it's not easy to engage with or invest any strong feelings. Ultimately, it is neither overly shocking nor particularly thrilling to experience, rather an event to be watched and appreciated for it's gorgeously smart and stylish artifice rather than it's soul.Performances are excellent, but one wonders how much longer Nicole Kidman can continue to convince in dramatic roles. Her cosmetically re-sculpted features give the impression of gradually approaching the completely repellent and inhuman look of Joan Rivers - that of having the amputated face of a steam-ironed piglet stapled to the front of her head. She has trouble with facial expressions now and if she doesn't stop soon her clock will be immobilised. This can't be much good for any actress, but especially not for a skilled and talented one like Kidman. It would be a shame.Mia Wasikowska is a revelation as India and Matthew Goode hits all the right notes as the slyly impassive, insidiously charming but possibly dangerous Uncle Charlie.OK, so the plot is a Hitchcock steal (SHADOW OF A DOUBT) but if you're gonna steal you might as well do it from a true master - especially if you're going to acknowledge the fact. And calling Uncle Charlie Uncle Charlie rather than Uncle Bill clearly does this.Overall, a fascinating and diverting little film that probably subverts the expectations of many fans of the director. It's a change of pace and style, and the mark of a technically astute and creatively talented craftsman taking his own sweet time and doing things his way. I guess he could have made a revenge flick with Stallone or Statham instead - but where's the fun in that when you can approach the Hollywood machine on your own terms?",Stoker

103,Lucabrasisleeps,Nice Creepy Movie,7,10 January 2015,"This is an example of getting what I expect from a movie. I have been a big fan of Oldboy for a long time. While this movie is not even close to that one, this is a nice movie in its own right. It has the same over the top style although here it doesn't fit perfectly. Mia wasikowska is perfect as the protagonist. The performances overall are of high quality including that creepy Matthew goode character as the uncle. But again the whole setting seems unreal and I guess that is the point. The point is to create a movie with a poetic style.The focus is on the creepy nature of the relationships between the three main characters. I didn't feel comfortable with the nature of these relationships and their behaviours. It doesn't really have any scenes which are sick but for the most part, there is an undercurrent of immorality between the characters. The whole family was never normal at any point of time and they don't want to be. The ending is proof of that. There are certain scenes which are memorable (especially the piano playing) and those scenes elevate the movie from just being a normal predictable story to something much better. There is emphasis on creating atmosphere and slowly developing the story and characters which I find praiseworthy. I liked it. 7/10",Stoker
104,postsenthil,A MUST WATCH !!,9,27 October 2019,"Stoker is the striking English language debut of Korean master auteur Park Chan-wook (Old Boy, Vengeance Trilogy, Joint Security Area). He conjures up a brilliant mystery (not exactly a whodunit) which could as well be his personal ode to the master of suspense, Hitchcock.Stoker is the story set in a wealthy Connecticut family living in a huge mansion surrounded by sprawling woods. India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska) is distraught when her beloved father Richard Stoker (Dermot Mulroney), with whom she shared a (perhaps her only) close relationship, dies in a car accident, on her eighteenth birthday. A shocked India and her grieving mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman), with whom she has a frosty relationship, are joined at the funeral by her Uncle Charlie (Mathew Goode) whose existence she was hitherto unaware of. When the enigmatic Charlie quickly wins over Evelyn with his wit and charms his way into the family's fold, India feels a rising sense of uneasiness and fails to warm upto him. Nevertheless, she also a senses a strange connect with him even as he goes overboard to be caring and protective of them. India also senses a similar sense of discomfort is shared by her caretaker and her visiting aunt Gwendolyn (Jackie Weaver) towards Uncle Charlie. Curiously, both of the caretaker and the aunt go missing without a trace. Without revealing any further, let me just add that the title of movie refers to more than just the name of the family at the center of all action here. And no, it does not refer to Bram Stoker or Dracula and none of the characters jump to take a bite at other's throats.
Is Uncle Charlie plainly eccentric or is there something even more sinister to him ? Is he actually the globetrotter he claims to be ? Why hasn't he ever made any contact with any of them in all these years till the untimely death of India's father ? Is Evelyn just an emotionally fickle person who merely leans on the shoulder of Charlie for emotional support ? And, what does one make of India herself, with her reticence and compulsive aloofness ? What should one make of her inherently paradoxical connect to her eerie Uncle, her lurking aggression and her acute sensory gifts ?The rest of the movie unravels answers to all these questions and more through meticulously mounted frames, rich with details, where Park works on the deepening mystery surrounding the Stoker family. The viewer is made continuously aware that there is more to these characters than what meets the eye and their curiosity is piqued to decipher their actions and motives.
The three main leads, aptly cast, have played their parts beautifully portraying the necessary level of ambiguity about the characters and are successful in keeping the viewer engrossed and guessing. Mia Wasikowska is first rate as India Stoker packing several layers of nuances under her apparent plain looks. She puts in a riveting performance as the lonesome, serious and introverted teenager who is curious about the mysterious happenings around her as well as within her. Nicole Kidman is convincing as an emotional messed up woman with a chilly relationship with her daughter. Mathew Goode is exceptional as he brings to life a twisted character who oozes charm and eerie menace in equal measure.While there is no doubt that this a well concocted mystery, it is indeed the atmospherics that Park builds up the tension with each passing frame that make this movie outstanding. He seems an artist working intricately at each of his visuals to create the eerie aura of rising suspense and tension. He is assisted in his task by brilliant cinematography and a potent score - check out the scene at the piano when India is interrupted and later, joined by Charlie. While Park is well known for his stylish, bloody and twisted stories of vengeance, the violence in Stoker, save for a few parts, is confined almost exclusively in the psychological sphere, which makes it all the more effective. It is the mastery of Park that he successfully maintains the aura of unease and nervous expectation of an impending explosive event throughout the course of the movie.Stoker works on a subtle level and straddles more than one genre in a manner that is so unique to it's master director. It delves into the dark recesses of the human mind and presents its punches in an unhurried manner even as it keeps the viewers on the edge with each unfolding disturbing twist of event.Overall, this is a SUPERB, twisted, gothic and accomplished thriller from a master in his prime that is sure to spook the viewers even as it keeps them glued and guessing.",Stoker

In Stoker, Park's fixation for the bizarre and the morbid is once again on full display. But, he is clearly a bit more cautious than usual. He seems to keep his characters on a tight leash for a much longer duration, and this makes the movie's first half appear much slower and less hyper than a typical Park film. But, once the dust settles down, the viewer is treated to sheer mastery of Park's craft. In Stoker, Park pays homage to the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Those who have seen Hitchcock's 1943 thriller Shadow of a Doubt wouldn't find it hard to draw parallels. Park limns a colorful canvas like only he can and his characters tread it like spirits caught in a limbo. While the characters are highly emotional, their strangely selfish actions make it difficult for the viewers to sympathize with them. Chung-hoon Chung's alluring cinematography gives the movie a hypnotic feel. The acting of movie's three lead characters viz. Mia Wasikowska, Nicole Kidman, and Matthew Goode is quite brilliant and in that order. Overall, Stoker is an intriguing work of cinema that despite managing to stoke the fire of curiosity may still leave any keen-eyed, intelligent viewer high and dry. Those accustomed to watching the quintessential Hollywood product are likely to find Stoker very strange and deeply disturbing. But, if you are looking for something different to break your monotonous daily routine then Stoker will surely not disappoint you. 8/10For more, please visit my film blogsite:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",Stoker

The title and trailer made me think that Charlie was a vampire and that he had come to terrorise India and her mum. However, this movie is quite perverse because it shows us the
underlying fascination and obsession that Charlie has for his niece, India. Wherever she goes, he follows, and he will do just about anything to get closer to her. India and Charlie are similar creatures because they can hear and see things that most people can't and because of this, Charlie believed that they belonged together.Mia Wasikowska and Matthew Goode delivered incredible performances and as a viewer, I could feel and see the tension between the characters very clearly, which lasted until the end of the film.

I'm okay with the slow creepy atmosphere in this movie but there are too many loose ends in the movie like the sudden disappearance of a character at the residence and no one cares. Also many other silly scenes that is totally unexpected from the director who gave a classic cult movie like 'Old-boy'. The storyline is too thin as a kitten's whisker and movie never took off.

110,joker-4,Suspenseful. Alluring. Slow.,7,17 April 2014,"STOKER is a surprisingly decent indie film written by an American television actor, directed by a Korean known for violent action flicks, all told in a suspenseful vein that Alfred Hitchcock would find suitably satisfactory, especially with the themes presented within: loner child, daddy issues, ignorant mother, suspicious uncle and death, death, death.Mia Wasikowska is India, the likeably-cliché intelligent teen who turns her focus from the ridicule suffered at school and the inattention of her depressed mother – the un-aging Nicole Kidman – to that of her mysteriously-alluring uncle, who may have clues regarding her father's death from when she was a child. Uncle Charles, played straight faced-creepy by Matthew Goode, offers India freedom, knowledge and empowerment as well as a few lessons that aren't always part of the standard learning curve.Chan-wook Park constructs a visually beautiful movie that perfectly reflects the images, dreams and even memories that would belong to a solitary young woman, all which provide visual clues to the mystery at large. The excellent score by Clint Mansell completes the imagery. However, the first act of the film is terribly slow as the images alone don't move the narrative forward. Likewise, India's journey becomes too forced in order to reach the film's resolution. Park appears to be more interested in the look of the mystery than getting into the actual character impetus behind that mystery.STOKER is an enjoyable film to watch. The film is also a killer to get frustrated over.",Stoker
111,Man99204,Annoying BAD BAD BAD,1,3 February 2015,"I cannot remember ever watching a movie as completely repugnant as this one. There are absolutely NO redeeming qualities to this movie.Mia Wasikowska acts as if she is so heavily medicated she has trouble delivering even the most basic lines. Her range of acting in this movie runs the gamut from ""full on ennui"" to ""constipated"".Nichole Kidman is so heavily botoxed she has absolutely no movement in her face for the entire movie.Matthew Goode is normally a very charming and gifted Actor. He is totally wasted in this movie.I can only assume that the actors agreed to do this movie because family members were being held hostage -- it is just THAT bad. (and not in an ""ed Wood bad' sort of way.... just in an incredibly STUPID and total waste of time way.)",Stoker
112,jimlacy2003,A stroke of the boring,4,25 June 2013,"The problem with this movie was that it wasn't very engaging to begin with.Okay there is this girl. She's kind of weird. Is she autistic, crazy, or what?Hey Nicole Kidman is in this, maybe it's good; only to ask my self later why was she even in this?Then there is this uncle. I realize later their glances are not sexual necessarily. But it looked that way at first. Is this guy some sort of incestual pervert, has some mysterious involvement with the story, or also just weird? Not engaging to me. No hook, not an interesting mood/setting, pace was slow, just blaugh.. And I can't tell you any more because I gave up on it some time about half way through.Really people compare this to Hitchcock? I'd say not even close. Hitchcock has you from the beginning. Once you're there you don't want to leave your seat. This is the opposite, making you wonder for an excuse to to be elsewhere.",Stoker
113,Macleanie,Stoker is a fantastic watch.,7,18 June 2019,A sick and twisted plot brilliantly screened by Chan Wook Park. I was encaptured by Stoker's perverse and disturbing tone. It was creepy and sincere. Uncle Charlie is a creepy character who's got a horrific background which is slowly unveiled. Throughout the film there is a great balance of uncovering the truth whilst understanding India's odd fascination of her new Uncle. Its brilliant to watch such a unique and unpredictable horror which builds sexy but chilling tension. Stoker felt that with its great plot it was lacking something a little more substantial however Stoker is a fantastic watch.,Stoker
114,s_campanale,Beautiful Mess - Stokers Dracula stakes Hitchcock and Heathers ground but suffers identity crisis as a result,7,1 March 2013,"Stoker has the promise of being a strong, dark twisted tale of family intrigue, forbidden fruit and the old sex and death double act mixed with that most terrifying of times, adolescence. It is directed by the Korean master of twisted tales, Chan-Wook-Park, and it has very effective and creepy trailers and promotional posters. But does it live up to the promise?Stoker, written by actor Wentworth Miller no less, blends many influences and narratives. The name drop reveals the Dracula inspiration, with a dark and irresistibly seductive handsome stranger coming into a closed bourgeois family bringing repressed lust and death with him, and a young girl caught up in his spell (India is part Lucy and part Mina here, and even has the same super human senses without need of a bite) However there's also Hithcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" as inspiration, leading to much suspicion and hidden past revealing, and also a lot of ""Heathers"" too, as repressed bland girl India is seduced into amorality and murder by a seductive teacher and takes bloody revenge on her schoolmates. However, like say ""Skyfall"", it ends up as a sort of patchwork quilt of totally different scenarios and stories, with no one strand ever becoming the dominant theme. It covers all the above aspects, but never really says anything about them. Rising star Mia Wasikowska is centre stage here, fast becoming this generation's Wynona Ryder – Like Ryder she was launched in a family fun project by Tim Burton (Alice in Wonderland) and now plays a ""Heathers"" role (as well of course as a Mina Harker one!) Apart from the apt coincidences, Waskiowska here displays a lot of talent, but in the service of what? India is a strange girl who doesn't fit in, has unnaturally developed senses, and a penchant and aptitude for killing (Her father taught her to be an ace hunter, as it turns out in order to redirect her homicidal tendencies) we learn this almost right off the bat, and her character doesn't have much of an arc. She ends up becoming a killer, but we know this from the very beginning, so where have we gone with that? As a central character, we need more from her, and Mia deserves more too.Nicole Kidman, as India's widowed mother, just hangs around the house being rather sad and pathetic, and then disappears from half the film, and returns being sad and pathetic again. Again she has no real arc, and her character is passive and one dimensional. Kidman plays her well, but there's so little there to play.The real revelation is Matthew Goode, who had already essayed a cold dark soul as Ozymandias in ""Watchmen"", playing the mysterious Charles Stoker with style and menace. Here is a true Vampire, suave, charming, yet creepy, unsettling, with nothing beneath the façade, a beautiful walking corpse feeding off others. For the first half of the movie he comes close to being the greatest ever screen Dracula. However the plot takes hold three quarters in and his powerful character is diminished and reduced to a sad pathetic joke, which is a true shame. The rapport he has with Wasikowska is spellbinding and strong (until said silly plot revelations) and the ""vampire seduction"" working slowly yet effectively – They even have their own Phillip Glass penned ""Vampire Rhapsody"" piano piece that draws India into the darkness and Charles embrace.The story offers hints at things it then ignores, principally the idea of a legacy of evil in the noble, rich Stoker family (House of Usher in the mix too?) It is implied that Charles is, like India, naturally attuned to murder and violence, and he somehow recognises this in her despite never having met her, seeing her as his ""soul mate"" in evil. He also shares her unnaturally advanced senses, so is this a family inheritance? He seems to know India will carry the ""evil seed"", and so does his brother/her father, so there has to be some family legacy of darkness twinned with superior abilities for them to reach this conclusion. It would have added a lot of weight to the story, but I guess they simply left it implied.With the story strands such a mess, it's left to Park to infuse the story with his trademark unsettling poetic style, which he does with aplomb. It is a beautifully shot, beautifully choreographed, beautifully scored mess and won't bore or not satisfy on some level.Stoker is not a bad film, and a refreshing one in these times of creative austerity, but it also one of those films where you feel you've been somehow short changed by what could have great but instead is merely OK.",Stoker
115,Pat100,Quite a Spooky Masterpiece.,9,27 August 2021,"An exceptionally well-told story. I couldn't fault it. No plot holes. No illogical behaviour going against character. Superb acting. Great pacing. No banal ""mood-enhancing"" music.I think that the only criticism anyone could make is that they didnt like the story. Which would just be a matter of personal taste.I thought that it was a wonderful, macabre, creepy tale. Every little baffling action and piece of dialogue fitted perfectly into the whole.I'd have to admit that a few pieces only made sense when I was sitting thinking about it in my armchair as the credits rolled. (Even the spiders) But they didn't spoil the flow which carried me along from start to finish.",Stoker
116,ernesti,Mysterious uncle comes to stir things up,4,12 September 2014,I had never heard of the director and his name is so hard to remember that it's best left unmentioned.A grieving mother and daughter meet a mystery uncle who comes to live with them for a while after the funeral. They'd not heard of him before and it's unclear what his motives are.There are some likable things in this film. For example it resembles many European films that have slow paced storytelling style that centers upon the characters. That's just about the only thing that i liked but the characters aren't very likable so it sort of ruins it.Pacing is problematic when the usual bad guy is revealed just after the first third and there's an hour left. There's not so many surprises left in the rest of the film. All in all it's quite bland and conventional that i've just grown to expect from American films of this kind.I don't think that i had become his fan after seeing this film. I think the Asian director was just told that you can't do this and that and it in American film - anything else goes if it doesn't make the viewer feel too bad or excited.In overall i can't really recommend this film. Teens will probably find any horror film exciting.,Stoker

Great visuals, great attention to details (the shoes metaphor, I especially adore the Louboutin heels as a sign of growing up, changing, becoming more mature and dangerous), too sexual and disturbing, but also kinda relatable (unlike Oldboy which I despise), good soundtrack.

119,cheer88,Articulated Psychopath,7,21 October 2015,"I am not a fan of the psycho thrillers. However, I did some research on their behaviors which I was intrigued by. I think I have more insights than general misconceptions. This movie on that front is well-interpreted.This movie is well-made throughout the cinematography. The dialogue was short and concise which it should be in this genre. It's a movie giving audiences visible senses without directly tell them verbally. The well-planned settings pretty much preceded the story. I would say the right casts and settings made this movie half way success already. It has the thrilling effects like those Hitchcock's movies. It abandoned those techniques most thriller movies used nowadays i.e. grossly terrified themes. They usually left no room for audiences to image. If you are not a thriller seeker, you will like this one.",Stoker

Thus, it is not only difficult to connect with any of the characters, but their reasoning is completely alien. The acting was mediocre...The story is set up early on and it is evident how it will progress. The pacing was bad considering some sections felt drawn out and plain boring. Some details were exposed prematurely, making some potentially emotional moments later on not very impactful at all.",Stoker
121,hkauteur,HK Auteur Review - Stoker,7,25 June 2013,"After India's (played by Mia Wasikowska) father dies, her Uncle Charlie (played by Matthew Goode), who she never knew existed, comes to live with her and her unstable mother Evelyn (played by Nicole Kidman). She comes to suspect this mysterious, charming man has ulterior motives and becomes increasingly infatuated with him.Screenwriter Wentworth Miller has stated that this is not a vampire movie. To this I say, ""Trust the tale, not the teller."" Regardless of what Miller says, it's a vampire film or not, Stoker is clearly playing to the beats of a vampire film underneath its surface.There are things at play that suggest this, Uncle Charlie is fixated with India and he preys on her. India seems to possess some kind of innocence or purity that is at stake of being corrupted. Lastly, the movie is called Stoker. That's no accident.It's as if someone took a traditional vampire movie, folded it inside out, wore it like a bag on his head looking outside from within. That's the way to watch Stoker. Anybody who says there is nothing happening in this story is not looking at the subtext. The subtext is the supertext, that's where the story is taking place. Park Chan-Wook leaves a lot of empty space for the audience to ponder about what's going on. There is a whole lot going on if you tune to the film's grammar and look in the right places.Matthew Goode has always had this steely piercing look that looks sinister and that quality is well used under Park's direction. Park knows how to pull back and just shoot an actor in a certain pose to emote a mood or feeling. As Uncle Charlie, we never know what he's thinking or if we can really trust his intentions. Mia Wasikowska and Nicole Kidman give fine performances but Matthew Goode gives the standout performance. The real star of the film however is Park Chan-Wook himself. He elevates the script by adding a visual poetry that subtly implies. Everything is played at such a low volume that the audience is unnerved waiting for the tension to crescendo.A good companion piece to Stoker is Park Chan-Wook's 2009 vampire horror film Thirst; it's probably what got Park the job. This is probably one of the best English-language debut for an Asian director. It's a smooth transition as his directorial stamp is very much present. You will need to put in more brain work for Stoker, but it pays off.For more reviews, please visit my blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",Stoker
122,michael-3204,"Pretentious, unsatisfying creeper",4,19 August 2014,"It's too bad Chan-wook Park made this empty parade of pretty pictures as his English-language debut. ""Stoker"" recalls decades of better horror films and psychological thrillers, but doesn't live up to them. For me, the main problem was the stifling characterizations -- or perhaps characterizations, since none of the main characters were remotely developed or fleshed out. These cardboard rich people are distinguished only by their self-absorption and the emptiness of their lives. None of the rest of the cast is on-screen enough to be anything more than ciphers.Instead of focusing on a compelling story about people who can hold our interest, Park focuses on carefully composed shots and elaborate sound editing to give them film atmosphere. In that he is very skilled -- this film is nothing if not pretty to look at. If you like the type of film where the director is waving his arms all the way through calling attention to the choices he makes, this film is for you. One reason ""Stoker"" seems so derivative of much better movies with much more psychological depth is Park's determined emphasis of style over substance, surface over meaning and emotional impact. ""Stoker"" works well enough as a class in how to construct some compelling shots. Unlike the films it apes, it doesn't construct anything in the service of creating something richer.Watch this if you're a film student prepared to study; don't watch if you're in the mood for something that will engage you on more than a cerebral level. It is coldly beautiful, limp and lifeless.",Stoker
123,aldri-feb,A beautiful and unique movie from Chan-Wook Park,8,6 April 2013,"Stoker is kind of dark and unusual movie. I think some people will hate it because the story of this movie is a little bit confusing, not entertaining and really slow. I actually quite enjoy watching this movie because it's interesting that makes me curious about the twist at the end of the film. It's not like another American drama-thriller movie for sure. I think this movie is more like Chan-Wook Park's style which is not easily understood and having slow storyline.The most credits should be given to the strong performance by their three main casts. Three main characters really determine how would this movie would be and make it their own. I especially like Matthew Goode's role as a cool mysterious psychotic guy, the character match with him. There's also a great cinematography in this film that wouldn't make you bored watching it.Overall, Stoker is a feel-good thriller movie which has an interesting and confusing storyline. May be it's not acceptable movie for everyone because of it's uniqueness. I'm actually not a fan of Chan-Wook Park's movie. Two of his movie I've seen (""I'm a Cyborg but That's OK"" and ""Thirst"") is not good enough for me. But I really appreciate of what he's doing on his first American film industry debut as a director. It's satisfying and good package of movie. Recommended",Stoker
124,shinsrevenge,disturbing,3,29 September 2015,"""Do not disturb the family"" the movie cover says. It's to be understood as a warning. More for the viewer than for the family. The movie already starts weird, showing us in the first minutes from really close views how the daughter penetrates a pus blister on her foot. You learn that she lost her father recently and now lives with her mother and a older caretaker in a big estate. In her free time she lets spiders crawl up her legs and between them. Or she lies on her bed with countless shoe boxes placed around her in a circle.You think it can't get much stranger? The uncle comes and kills the caretaker to hide his identity. She finds the dead caretaker's head between ice in the freezer. Nothing wrong with that, because she's just as messed up as her uncle. When a young man from school starts bothering her, she just takes out her pencil and rams it into his hand. They are quite a good match, as far as being disturbed goes. So it doesn't surprise that she falls for her uncle. Especially after he kills a young man before her eyes. She memorizes that scene to use it for some masturbation in the shower. That's sick...Anyway, they want to take a leave because the sheriff starts asking too many questions about the missing people. Just when they are about to depart her uncle decides to try to kill her mother as well, because she starts to understand what happened there all the time.But wait, you can't kill the mother without having the lovestruck daughter watch it! So he calls out for her to enjoy the show. For no reason she takes out a rifle, kills him, hugs him afterwards to get full of blood and then leaves her mother behind and departs with the car. On her way out of town she is stopped by the sheriff. After placing a hedge trimmer in his throat she supposedly finishes him off with the rifle. The End.Apart from the disturbing story the movie also offers some long conversations and monologues. I liked the dead father the best, who is sometimes shown in memory scenes. Maybe because he was a quiet one. I was grateful for the opportunity to grant my eyes and ears a break. Anyway, the movie is good in showing you things you don't want to see and make you listen to stuff you don't want to hear. So unless you are into that kind of entertainment, skip this one.3/10",Stoker
125,nikashvili,Chan-wook Park's Best,8,14 June 2013,"The movie is a story of India Stoker (Mia), her mother Evelyn (Nicole) and uncle Charles (Matthew) who unite after the brutal murder of Mr. Stoker.India is a troubled young girl, opposite of any teenager of her age. She dresses differently, acts weirdly, having no friends and always gets bullies from classmates. The only person she seems to get along is already dead father, who used to take her hunting. This can be her most favorite memories from childhood. India does not enjoy with the company of other people, especially her mother, who's been trying to settle relationship with daughter unsuccessfully. Despite being a grown-up, she still feels like a kid needing a care and love of parents. Probably, this is a reason for hating Evelyn - her inability to actually be a mother. Mr. Stoker, on the contrary, is a good father. According to memories of India, he was the only person making her feel like a child. He used to send the same type of childish shoes on every birthday. Every year the shoes looked like the same, only different size.On her 18th birthday, she gets a present from Charles - high heels - as a mark of grown, independent person. And she starts making decisions by herself, which might lead to disaster or anything else.Evelyn has been a good wife, but worse mother. She really loves her only daughter, but never managed to be her good friend. While her husband was alive, she did not care much about India, but now she's alone and she needs her. An unexpected visit of Charles - brother of Mr. Stoker - changes a lot. Evelyn starts to spend some time with him, totally forgetting about depressed girl. Charles is a handsome and good man, trying to do his best to make sister-in-law's days easier. It works. But India knows that there is something wrong with him feeling unsafe with him. But you can't say that she's afraid of uncle, she's more curious, even more charmed by this creepy man. The same time, she does not like him disturbing her quiet life in a big house. Irksome irritation transforms in attraction, as Charles follows her everywhere, giving weird looks every time they face each other.Stoker is an enjoyable movie, with brilliant acting, writing and creative features. I liked that Park used lots of symbols to deliver the true content of whole film: shoes, gifts, ice cream and etc. Script is beautifully written with very smart and interesting dialogs, the sequence of every event in movie is logical and well fitted. It may seem that all characters are very cold, they almost lack this warmth part of humanity. Their interaction with each other does not go further then average daily dialogs. But it still makes you want to fully explore them and watch movie until the very last second to discover why things go the way they do.Mia Wasikowska is brilliant choice as India. She's so powerful, I can't actually articulate true extent of her brilliance. She is like a puzzle, unemotional, cold face girl, who never gives her inside feelings away. You never know, what's up her mind. India is a quest - a challenge to discover her personality. Matthew Goode who replaced Collin Firth for this role, does an outstanding job by portraying sociopath uncle. Nicole Kidman lists another great performance in her acting history for being an indifferent, depressed and emotional mother. Her short speech about having children and parenthood is a perfect example of perfect performance.Cinematography is something that really amazes you in Stoker - it has smart, beautiful and very precise shots which totally help to tell a story. Camera work makes spectacular to explore each character, especially India who turns out to be in the frame of most shots.And finally, music that makes the whole movie creepier - Clint Marshal's amazing sounds and Philip Glass's perfect piano piece.All these boils down to my astonishment and final rating 9. One of the best movies seen lately. Totally recommended.",Stoker
126,sanjidparvez,Visually magnificent thriller without a 'doubt' but not our favorite Chan-wook Park film.,7,25 September 2013,"It's surely an awesome watch for Chan-wook Park's excellent cinematography with such great use of light, shadows & colors that made this thriller brilliantly atmospheric & engaging which would make Sir Alfred Hitchcock proud 'without a doubt'....but that's the thing I like to note here as a drawback for a film made by the director of such outstanding films like OlLODBOY & SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE. Though, as a new screenwriter, the Prison-Break actor Wentworth Miller done a very promising job & I'd love to hear that he gets busy with more scripts in coming days but as a story I found the STOKER is nothing but a modern & slightly twisted update of Hitchcock's SHADOW OF A DOUBT which stylishly made by Mr. Park and that's the little disappointment for me; as a fan of his earlier films, I expect more twisted & thought-provoking challenging stories in Park's film that would made our viewing experience something very special or unforgettable like the way he did in his Vengeance trilogy. But again, STOKER is obviously a quite satisfying experience for thriller lovers where the little cast convincingly shines through their roles, particularly Matthew Goode once again proves his talent (after the WATCHMEN) that he can be a significant choice for the filmmakers next time to play any psychologically twisted or intelligent bad guy role. Overall, STOKER is marvelous in visuals & character developments but plot wise it's just an old wine in a new bottle, which isn't a little bit of a bad thing at all unless it's made by a highly talented director like Chan-wook Park.",Stoker

In Park Chan-wook's ""Stoker"" another Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode) comes to live with his recently deceased brother's widow and young daughter. The daughter, India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska) was very attached to her late father with whom she shared hunting trips. The stuffed animals in her room are trophies to those bygone days. Her relationship with her mother, Evelyn (Nicole Kidman) is strained although we sense that it was never really that close. While Evelyn instantly warms up to Uncle Charlie India casts a suspicious eye and yet there is something about this secretive man with a knowing grin that attracts her.""Stoker"" is a chilling look at a world of hidden desires, predator and prey and things that go bump in the night. In this world evil doesn't simply co-exist in some aberrational sense but rather it's woven into the very fabric of the natural world. We cannot simply dismiss it as a Hitchcockian nightmare that we awaken from and go about our lives. Park Chan-wook's fluid direction adds to the feeling of uneasiness that pervades the film. There's excellent camera-work by Chung-hoon Chung.

129,ihearthorrorfilm,All 5 senses are used to view this film,10,6 June 2013,"Before you go out and see this film, you must ask your self one question. Does going to a fine art museum to look at masterpieces while listening to an iPod full of classical music sound interesting to you? If you say no, than I can confidentially tell you that you will not enjoy Stoker. Loving horror and/or Chan-wook Park is not enough.Where do I start with this spectacular piece of film? Do I start with the cinematography? The fact that you can pause any second of this film, print it out and hang it on your wall still doesn't justify how incredible the shots are. Every second of this film is so easy on the eyes and the acting is astonishing. Mia Wasikowska brilliantly glides from being a delicate, broken child to a mysterious woman with an old soul with ease. Her facial expressions and the way her eyes speak is astonishing. But even after the excellent acting, stunning visuals and unusual story, the thing that makes this film incredible is the sound. I've never paid much attention to sound in a film before like the way I did with Stoker. From early on, where she's rolling an eggshell against the table to the scene where she has her first glass of wine and you can actually hear her drinking and breathing in the aroma at the same time is absolutely insane. I also want to point out that Stoker has this amazing feel to it, much like a Hitchcock film, where the scenes are eerie and long. With our short attention spans from films with 100 shots per second, we lose the ability to appreciate the subtle genius of the highest quality acting, story and setting. Stoker is a perfect example of when psychological horror meets fine art and succeeds way beyond what the average film-goer can handle. There were moments when I couldn't pull my eyes and ears away from the screen because all my senses were being pulled into the film.

The cinematography and close attention to minor detail in sound and visuals make this worth seeing on the big screen, even though it is often lacking in major action or plot.Immediately when the uncle (Matthew Goode) arrives on scene, we are clued in that he is up to no good. He spends an inordinate amount of time looking generally creepy, which the camera lingers over to repeat the point to exhaustion. Ditto Nicole Kidman's vampish attraction. We are meant to see her as immoral, materialistic, and generally unconcerned with her late husband or living daughter, which would be no problem if this had a bigger payoff later. India is shown being bullied at school, but the film is so technical and aloof in is staging that we are never told particularly how she feels about these events. Her feelings would seem central to her later actions in the film. It's not necessary to hit us over the head with exact explanations, but considering how much the movie lingers on obvious motives of other characters, it is an odd exclusion.When the uncle makes his murderous intentions clear, we are again not particularly invested, because the film concerns itself more with atmosphere than with action or feeling. Fairly major actors and characters come and go without much comment. It is a well-shot scene wherein India comes to be attracted to her uncle. They play piano together in a scene that echoes the pottery scene in Ghost, but this does not explain her ultimate character motivation. We are never told why the uncle is so attached to his young niece, or why she should see him as anything but a repellent figure. It's hard to go into more without spoiling plot points, but India's psyche – despite the lingering, fawning presence of the camera surrounding her most of the time – is still too unexplored by the movie's end to justify her ultimate actions.I was a bit surprised given the Gothic elements of the story and the timeless nature of the house and surrounding areas that it was indeed set directly in the present. I think this bit would better have been left vague. And I do wonder if this movie is missing scenes that fill in more necessary elements of character. It could have inserted those scenes and left out the constant repetition of obvious character traits in Kidman and Goode's characters.Overall, this is worth seeing, particularly in high quality, on a big screen, paying full attention to its small intricacies. Perhaps repeat viewings will shed better light on motivations. Some may find India empowering as a character, but many just may find her a confusing nebulous puzzle not worth revisiting.",Stoker
135,Dorjee_Wang,Review,6,19 June 2015,"Stoker is Korean director Park ChanWook's first English venture, and also actor Wentworth Miller's first try at screen writing. A drama film with a touch of psychological thriller, the movie has a dark overtone about it.The movie follows the young loner India Stoker, who has trouble fitting in. Her interactions with an interested, unstable mother and a charming yet mysterious uncle, whose existence she hadn't known until she met him at her father's funeral is the central line of the movie. The plot falls short of being good. Most of the things don't make sense and seems a lazy endeavor at writing. While Wasikowska does sell the lonely willowy India, Nicole Kidman's unstable mother act doesn't do anything for the movie nor does Goode's stunt at being a psychopath.On the positive note, Chan Wook's directing doesn't fail this movie. With fragmented scenes and disturbing imagery, it elevates the movie adding just the right dose of vexing ambiance. 6/10",Stoker
136,amit_imt2002,A stylish chamber piece .,7,19 March 2013,"This is a year when Hollywood goes shopping to South Korea.PSY's Ganganam Style is already an edifice of global pop culture and 2013 is the year when the top three Korean directors Park Chan-wook, Bong Joon-ho and Kim Ji-woon make their Hollywood debut.Stoker is a sinister and a very stylish chamber piece from Park Chan-wook, bordering on the designer.The cast of characters is very small, just three lead characters who spend the whole film circling each other in a beautiful mansion decorated with a minimalist fastidiousness.Each shot is so carefully framed, you can imagine the exhaustion of the body doubles of the stars helping the camera department compose the shots to perfection.This is easily one of the more anticipated films of the year as it marks the English language debut of the man who made the Korean cult vengeance flick, Oldboy( currently ranked 84th on IMDb Top 250).Stoker looks at a very rich family living in an unnamed American small town, where they are well known enough and hated enough for the 18 year old India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska), to be the butt of rude variation of her surname.Her father Richard, has just died on her 18th birthday, in a mysterious car accident, and she has withdrawn into a shell.Her mother Evelyn(Nichole Kidman), who felt shut of the lives of the hunting obsessed father daughter duo, is looking to kick start her love life again.On cue arrives Charles( Matthew Goode) the long lost adventurer and explorer younger brother of Richard. We first see him at the funeral, standing at a distance, silhouetted like a Hitchcockian figure.We know clearly that that man will not be good for the young India.As the film progresses we see disturbing signs, Evelyn and Charles getting uncomfortably cosy,Charles being eerily sweet and accommodating to India, a housekeeper disappearing and an old Aunt who turns up to have a heart to heart with Evelyn, being thwarted.During the first 15 minutes of the film I was acutely aware of this being a motion picture, the camera was not unobtrusive but rather like the guiding hand of a confident director who knows his reputation supports his grandstanding.As the film progresses we get used to this very sexy slinky style and start getting involved with the characters.The plot treads timeworn material but the treatment is Mr Parks own.He gives us a shower scene that is chilling and disturbing and Charles quickly confirms our worst fears about him.What is interesting is his manner of doing what is expected of him.There is not a warm moment in the film.While Goode is definitely a find, as much as an established actor can be found, and Ms Wasikowska is a young lady whose internal mechanics remain mostly impenetrable, it is Nichole Kidman, who is the real casting coup.As the very rich, bored and stilted Evelyn, she looks the part.The efforts of Ms Kidman to remain frozen in time, by the help of whatever cutting edge cosmetic science she has harnessed, translate on the screen into a designer soullessness that adds to the chilly remoteness of the film.Stoker dwells quite a bit on the hunting rituals of India and her father and the consequences will no doubt add a tiny new dimension to the gun debate in USA where hunting is the holy cow that even Barrack Obama finds obligatory to endorse, by releasing pictures of himself with a smoking gun, aviators in place.It also creates a setting completely cut off from the rest of the dirty messy world and gives us characters who exist in a moral vacuum that drives them to commit ultraviolet acts without the least fear of consequences.The cinematography is dazzling and the undoubted highlight of the film. Stoker contains some astonishing images which have been meticulously created, worthy of hanging on the wall as high art.Stoker is edited tightly and has some engaging cuts.The sound design, costumes and production design are impeccable and raise the craft of this film to a new level.The interiors of the mansion where the film is shot, is dressed with extraordinary attention to detail.This is the finesse I had expected from a recent film called Beautiful Creatures but in complete contrast to the title, the film tried to be cinematically ugly, driving me out of the theater midway through its mess.This film takes off on the premise of ""Shadow of Doubt"" by Hitchcock and Mr Park says in a recent New York Times interview that he tries to bend the conventions of a genre and subvert the genre in the process.Here he makes a new kind of horror thriller.Surely fans of Oldboy had higher expectation of Stoker but Mr Park is content to pour old wine in a new designer bottle lovingly crafted by him.The product is smooth and indulgent and the arrival of Mr Park in Hollywood is good news for the fanboys.",Stoker

138,rsj624,"Eerie, Creepy, but Not Quite Everything it Tries to Be",4,17 December 2013,"--WARNING: There may be some spoilers ahead for those who haven't seen the film, so just a heads up. In order to accurately review this film, it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--Sometimes a movie tries to do a little too much, and Stoker is a great example of such a film. I feel as if I am one of the few who while watching this movie wasn't very impressed by anything it tries to do. It's a story about a girl who grows up shying away from society and all it's norms, and begins to become inspired more or less by her charismatic, yet outwardly creepy uncle, who shows up to comfort her mother after a tragic car accident takes her husbands life, who also happens to be said uncle's brother. He in turn is infatuated with her.The obvious things about this film that should be creepy are as eerie as can be without gore and disturbing imagery, but what keeps this from being a good watch is more due to the ever widening gap between blockbusters and indie films. These middle of the road films that try to look big budget with modest financing all to often grant themselves a campy and dated vibe, almost having a made for TV type gloss to their finished product, and when this movie in particular chooses to be stylized from time to time it often ends up looking amateur and even cliché. The flow of these stylized moments also lack good pacing as they occur either in quick succession or disappears all together for extended periods only to start showing up in troves again at a later time. It's far more distracting than it could ever been seen as a means to accentuate the film; and it makes things feel less serious and organic.It's other weakness is in it's decision to favor the less than plausible over sensibility and logic. One would assume for entertainment reasons, yet it's a mystery to me how any entertainment could be found most of the time during this film. Mia's character gives a good hour run just buying into this mans insanity, only to pull a complete 180 in the last fifteen minutes. It's also beyond hard to believe that no one single authoritative figure could pieces together how suspicious it is that her father just happens to die the exact same day that he picks up this mentally ill uncle from an institution he was committed to for something very similar in nature when he was growing up. Don't people have to sign release forms and stuff at those places? It's almost as if is movie was written without a clear intent or a consistent motive planned throughout, and in the end a jumbled up puzzle of confusion and creepiness prevailed without any solid message. It's clear why everyone's the way they are, yet their resolves, their choices, and even their actions throughout the film feel forced from an illogical world of ridiculousness, as if the only reality that exists is within the perimeters of their house, a highway, and a restaurant type place. When Nicole Kidman, who plays Mia's mother, begins to piece everything together, why would she call the uncle she suspects of foul play into the bedroom upstairs of all places? Again, in terms of logic, it couldn't feel more like a sandbox film.Maybe if this film was deliberately shot low budget as a showcase of a friendship between the uncle and niece that budded into a unique understanding of one another through not accepting society and people, it would've been a much more interesting movie, or even more so as a period piece during the 1800s or something. But instead, it's a messy blend of style and eerie atmosphere that lacks proper pacing and feels very haphazardly put together. It tries to empathize with it's leads and give reason for their madness, but instead it comes off as relentlessly grim and faithless all too often, as it doesn't give much of a chance to things like hope or even common sense as plausible tools to pull a character through a situation. It paints a picture of the introverted and angst-ridden individual as a kind of 'different' that automatically rejects all basic human reactions to norms and situations, like no one trait could exist without all the rest of an assumed identity or label to be present, inevitably leading to the worst. Case and point: **Biggest Spoiler** Mia's character ultimately becomes her uncle in the end by taking his life and begins her pursuit of freedom by following in his footsteps, which is all the more evident that he understands this by smiling at her before she offs him. This could've been a unique and creative film moment even if disturbing, but instead the film's aforementioned grim and faithless interpretation of introverts makes this an eye roller rather than an ""Oh My God!"" moment. Fortunately, you will find some moments of resolve if you stick this one out till the end; where you may go ""yes! thank you!"", but those moments are short lived, as it's clear they only exist as a way make sure in the end that more people enjoyed their experience watching this than hated it. Color me jaded; I did't buy most of Stoker.Anyways, just to clarify, the subject matter and the story on a whole had potential to tell decently disturbing tale, and the ideas on display where not the worst, nor where they the ultimate problem. It's depth just suffers serious sense and direction, and it's surface seems like it would've been much more suited for a gritty horror film, or even a lower budgeted blatant indie type art thriller more so than this unfortunate throwback made-for-TV-meets-straight-to-DVD fare it tries to pass off as something much more grandiose in the end.",Stoker

While watching this thriller you are lulled into believing you know how things will turn out only to be surprised by the turning of the plot twists that lead you down a garden path of suspense to an ending that will surprise and delight all thriller fans.Don't watch this movie to see ""horror"" type events that can only cheapen. Do watch this movie to see a suspenseful thriller develop to an effective ending, which is managed in the hands of one of the great thriller directors of all time who has at his command talent galore.This movie is also a masterpiece of character voyeurism.

She lives in a big luxurious house together with her mother and some house staff. After her father dies, her uncle Charlie who has been traveling the world, comes to pay his respects and stays over. Due to his presence, tension builds up within the household.People familiar with the work of director Park will not be surprised by his emphasis on detail and the artistic portrayal of on screen violence. Set and production design in this title are extraordinary. Kidman and Wasikowska both deliver a strong performance.Despite this I expected more from this director.

141,songbirdmc,Bizarre and disappointing,5,1 April 2018,"You will probably be scratching your head after this one. It's one of those films that tries to be really deep and artistic, but it's not. The description, I found, was misleading. It seemed to me that it is backwards. The uncle is actually infatuated with his neice, not the other way around at first at least. I kept expecting that this film would ultimately uncover a supernatural plot, but it didn't. It's suspenseful throughout and I can honestly say that I couldn't predict the ending nor what would happen from scene to scene. I didn't find any of the characters likeable except for the father and a couple other characters that didn't get enough screen time to really know for sure.Nicole Kidman is the same as always. Her acting annoys me for some reason. I just don't enjoy her. There was however one speech about why people choose to have children that she gave towards the end of the film that was pretty profound and put in a way I've never heard before, but agree with.

148,generationfilm,"An Overtly Suggestive Thriller that Thrives On Intense Visuals, Menacing Tones, and Morally Ambiguous Themes",8,22 March 2013,"All of the films by South Korean director Chan-Wook Park are far more than just intriguing thrillers because through his enhancing and poetic cinematic style coupled with deep contemplative themes he constructs morality plays that are modern, disturbing, and incredibly thought provoking. Chan-Wook Park thrives in the figurative and literal grey areas of life whether it's the conscience challenged vampire priest in Thirst or the geographical neutral area between North and South Korea in Joint Security Area. In his latest thriller, and American cinematic debut, there exists a reflective moral theme but due to its simplistic script not penned by the auteur himself there seems to be something lost in translation. All the appropriate pieces are placed in sequence, from his usual incestuous ponderings and heightened showcasing of mankind's dark nature, but ultimately the script's constant foreboding ruins any thrilling twists that could have otherwise been preserved had Chan-Wook Park been able to write the film himself. However, as American thrillers are concerned Stoker does somehow rise above their usual mediocrity due to Park's awe-inspiring visual display and his surprising ability to uproot uncomfortably creepy performances out of his eclectic cast. Critiquing this brooding cinematic movement from the South Korean auteur is a difficult challenge because while this might be his worst film to date it still contains an understanding of unnerving tone and complimentary visual genius that most American thrillers should try and replicate as often as possible. Despite the weak script that amplifies its twists through excessive suggestion Chan-Wook Park handles the process with elegance and patience that any other filmmaker would have ruined. While Stoker might be an overly done and simplistic human nature study it serves as an appropriate introduction to his previous works to an American audience that might have been unaware of his genius and also sets a promising foundation for future works to come.Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-wo",Stoker

151,tomas-344-902574,Morbid and amazing,9,13 June 2013,"I am not quite what to think about this movie..... The general synopsis is that it's about an 18 year old teenage girl named India and the uncle that has recently entered her life after her father dies. They are both morbid and disturbing people and it takes a while for her to warm up to her unusual uncle. As the story goes on she starts to see just how disturbing her uncle is, and even though at first she is hesitant, eventually it helps her explore her own morbidity. There is a bit of an erotic theme including a saucy masturbation scene. Her sexuality really doesn't have to do with incest or anything but more of her connecting with her darker, morbid side. The movie has a seed of horror but not so much that you could consider it to be a horror movie.It would seem that many people would question about there being many layers.... Of fantasy versus reality.... but I don't really know if that matters. I don't think there's a moment where it's obvious that the uncle either doesn't exist or is some fantasy of her imagination. Maybe, maybe not. The movie works well either way. There is some jealousy between the mother and daughter over the uncle's attention. The mother is a bit disturbed at their energy together. There is a scene with some morbid music where they play a duet that really strikes India to her emotional core, as if she's a bit overwhelmed that someone could understand the core of how she feels. The fantasy or reality of everything really doesn't matter, but the main theme is more that her disturbed uncle helps her embrace her own disturbed core. She definitely has a thing for blood and death. When her father was alive, he embraced that by taking her hunting frequently. There is some sort of quote that the father said to her once, that sometimes you have to help a person do something bad to prevent them from doing something worse.The story is a bit unusual and doesn't quite have the typical arc of most Hollywood movies. That may be a slight flaw. The directing and especially the camera work are custom tailored to the morbid theme and I would definitely rate them 10/10. Mia Wasikowska is impeccable as India Stoker. She's a very disturbed and morbid child, reminiscent of Wednesday Addams, minus the comedy. I had a certain unusual and morbid side to me as a teenager so I found her incredibly attractive. Her mannerisms are spot on, very quiet and cautious, with long disturbing stares and her head always tilted to the side. She was thrilling to watch and definitely attractive if you're into that kind of thing.",Stoker

""Stoker"" centers around a young girl named India, played by Mia Wasikowska who has recently lost her father Richard Stoker in an ""accident"". Her mother, Evelyn, played by Nicole Kidman is in a state of mourning and has not taken the incident lightly despite her having had a cold, distant relationship with her husband. Soon enough Richard's estranged brother, India's uncle Charlie, played by Matthew Goode shows up and begins courting Evelyn. India seems to somewhat loathe her mother and does not take kindly to Charlie's untimely arrival. Charlie tries to act friendly towards India, but she remains hostile and starts to notice something strange about his behavior. Despite India's hostility towards Charlie, they begin to form a strange friendship. Although, we soon discover that Charlie is harboring many secrets and has a very dark past.""Stoker"" is most definitely worth a watch. I personally really liked it, but I can totally understand someone not enjoying it. The main problem that hinders the story is that the film feels trivial or more likely, bloated. The characters seem to be extremely melodramatic and their actions are very predictable. This is not a problem with the performances, it is the script. Not to say that the writing is terrible, it's just feelsdull. On the other hand the film's strong point is the beautiful cinematography, great performances, and the slow, creepy atmosphere. Chan-wook Park shows that he can deliver beautiful imagery as well as showing us pure violence. Mia Wasikowska delivers a solid performance and has established herself as one of the brightest new actors working today. Nicole Kidman and Matthew Goode both deliver well rounded performances as well. The atmosphere of the film feels rather ""Hitchcockian"". The mystery and the plot twists make ""Stoker"" seem like a modern day Alfred Hitchcock film and is very similar to his classic mystery ""Shadow of a Doubt"".""Stoker"" has many flaws, but is ultimately an entertaining mystery as well as a powerful thriller. It is boasted by great performances, beautiful cinematography and most importantly a chilling atmosphere, reminiscent of the classic films directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Most definitely flawed, but ever so entertaining. A great, dark coming of age story",Stoker
153,tvmovienews,Stoker,7,5 August 2013,"Stoker is a thriller which follows a girl named India (played by Mia Wasikowska), who's forced to live with her unstable mother (Nicole Kidman) after her father dies in a car accident. Her uncle (Matthew Goode) who reminds me a lot of the Norman Bates character in 'Psycho', returns home to live with them and help support them after travelling the world, however India suspects this mysterious and charming man has an ulterior motive. Originally Carey Mulligan, Jodie Foster and Colin Firth were cast, but all had to drop out and were subsequently replaced by the names mentioned above, who all do an excellent job in their respective roles. The look and feel of this film is undoubtedly its greatest asset, which is largely associated to the fact that one of my favourite foreign directors of all time, Chan-Wook Park was at the helm in his first English language film. Chan-Wook Park is famous for such films as his Vengeance trilogy (including 'Oldboy' which is being remade in Hollywood), 'Thirst', 'Joint Security Area' and 'Three... Extremes'. The man is an absolute genius, and I highly recommend anyone to seek out these films. Stoker is written by 'Prison Break' star 'Wentworth Miller', and while it was a good first attempt at writing, it is probably its biggest weakness. While this is a fairly standard psychological thriller, the innovative cinematic techniques and camera work hold the film together.My Rating: 6.5/10 For more Movie and TV News, Reviews and Rumours go to: www.facebook.com/tvmovienews",Stoker

156,Boris_Day,Chan-wook Park go home !,2,2 March 2013,"Stoker is more proof that when Asian directors go Hollywood, most of them make films so bad that it makes me question whether they ever were any good in the first place. And yet the fans of the director were ready to love this long before it came out and have convinced themselves that it is great, hence this currently has a 7.9 rating on IMDb. Taking Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt as a jumping off point, without being interested in what that film does formally and emotionally, Stoker is an empty, airless film which just lies there to be stylish. One may just as well leaf through an issue of Elle Decor and get the same result. The characters are blunt archetypes with no interior lives and none of them appear to have a single recognisably human emotion. Everything they do is to fit into the visual design, which is an aesthetic over-familiar from the type of commercials which have borrowed from David Lynch and Tim Burton. The plot is predictable for anybody who has ever seen a psycho thriller, down to the denouement. TV actor turned screenwriter Wentworth Miller replaces Hitchcock's and Thornton Wilder's coming-of-age heartbreak with glib misanthropy and otherwise stays out of the way for the visuals. While the film pays homage to the odd Hitchcockian high concept visual, the image is never in service of the story, the story is there to contrive the image. Unlike Brian De Palma's flamboyant variations on Hitchcock themes this has no cinematic flow and feels far longer than its 100 minutes. Like with John Woo, Hideo Nakata and Wong Kar-Wei something went lost with this Hollywood debut by Chan-wook Park.At least Stoker has reminded me to watch Shadow of a Doubt again and that is the only good thing I can say about it.",Stoker

I can firmly say with utter relief that this is not the case with Chan- wook Park's 'Stoker'.Stylish, artistic, beautiful, controversial and feeling much more like a movie from his native South Korea; Chan-wook Park is bang on form. All that's changed is the actors are American and speak in the English language, and the location of course. I sincerely hope Hollywood takes note that this is how to do it right! Don't interfere with the artist and corrupt and americanise their vision. However, I have heard there was a 20 minute enforced cut made to the film by an editor for the studio. Here's what the Director has to say about it: ""It's just such a different animal from what I've experienced in Korea,"" he says, ""but it's just like how you can't really complain about the weather in the States when you're going over to shoot a film. The Searchlight people had good taste, though. There were some differences of opinion, but at least they didn't make any nonsensical remarks."" Chan-wook Park is responsible for such acclaimed movies as 'Oldboy', 'Lady Vengeance' and 'Thirst'. Until now at least, 'Oldboy' was his most famous movie, and an American remake nobody wants is due for release soon. 'Stoker' is admittedly less violent and more subtle than those movies, but only because frequent action isn't suitable for this particular script. It's primarily a character study focusing on the loss of innocence, and I'm sure some less contemplative people hoping for frequent action will be disappointed. When it comes to style and controversy though, this movie delivers and was everything I'd hoped it would be. It's stunning to look at and almost every shot is symbolic. More often than not it's sexual symbolism regarding loss of innocence, and the same goes for the frequent symbolism in the dialogue. Furthermore, there's a wonderful Hitchcock feel to it and clearly pays homage to 'Shadow Of A doubt' with a character called Uncle Charlie.The writer is Wentworth Miller, an actor, and this being his first screenplay makes it all the more impressive. Erin Cressida Wilson (Secretary, Chloe) is credited as contributing writer. Based on the quality of this movie, Wentworth Miller needs to get writing some more screenplays.I also felt the subject matter was a perfect match for Director Chan-wook Park, who's no stranger to controversial themes. It's a really rather pervy film, even if done subtly, artistically, and almost entirely non-explicitly. However, there's one particular scene I found gloriously wrong and solidified my opinion that the filmmakers had at least been respected and the goal of the studio wasn't to tame and americanise the Director. However, it will be interesting if a Director's cut comes out, or at least deleted scenes to see what cuts were made and if they were a good move making it less baggy or toning it down. The important thing as of now is that the result is a great movie. Movie critic Chris Tookey, for The Daily Mail, was disgusted by the film, so it can't be that toned down. A one star review from this man almost guarantees greatness.The title and characters' surname 'Stoker' has obvious vampiric connotations, so some will be wondering if it's a vampire movie. Well it is and it isn't There are no fangs or capes or turning into bats, but the name 'Stoker' is certainly no coincidence. Vampire mythology, literature and movies are loaded with symbolism of the sexual predator seducing the innocent. Furthermore, one of the definitions of the word 'vampire' is non-literal, simply meaning a person who preys on others. Vampires are also natural hunters and killers and there's a nature verses nurture aspect. These themes are essentially what the movie is about.Nicole Kidman plays mother 'Evelyn Stoker', and Matthew Goode plays charismatic, creepy Uncle 'Charles Stoker', but there's simply no argument as to who steals the limelight and it's Mia Wasikowska (Alice In Wonderland, Jane Eyre), as 18 year old 'India Stoker'. The actress is 23 but easily passes for an 18 year old. Her character is the main focus of the film and I feel she was perfectly cast for the role. She's old enough to be sexy, yet young enough looking so you feel a little conflicted about thinking so, and, despite her innocent appearance, has a facial quality that you can believe hides a personality more sinister. The character she plays is deeply intriguing and her acting as a dark, sexually ripe, moody introvert was magnetic and convincing. If it happened to be awards season, I'd say she was in with a chance of some nominations, but then when does subtle acting as a quiet introvert ever get nominations? It may only be the beginning of March, and there's been a lot of great movies so far in 2013, but I think 'Stoker' is the best film of the year at this point. It's not only the exception to the rule that Asian Director's first English language features are watered down missteps, but it's a film I thoroughly enjoyed and left the cinema genuinely excited about. You know that feeling when you find a movie that you really connect with and you can't wait to tell everyone about it? It's one of the best feelings in the world. Produced by Ridley and Tony Scott, 'Stoker' is an example of Hollywood getting it absolutely right, so please go and support it.",Stoker
158,Bonhamkt,Horror Trunk Review: Malice in Stokerland,6,7 March 2013,"No stranger to family dilemmas and manipulating genres, Park Chan-wook (The Vengeance Trilogy) is back with his first English-language release. In Stoker the shots are arranged much like paintings, the sharp colours and the framed spaces, create a beautiful and surreal element to the film.The narrative could have been tighter, but this film presents an interesting theme of sexual awakening, violence, and the senses.Not as violent as previous work, but an impressive psychological look into families and loyalty.I wonder what my uncle is up to at the weekend......bowling maybe...Full review at the horrortrunk website.",Stoker
159,jesse-hitzroth,We are family.,8,14 July 2013,"Chan-Wook Park debuts here with his first English film. He is highly regarded for his wonderful film 'Oldboy'. Stoker is a dark thriller that can be described as pure Hitchcock. It's slow moving, yet keeps the viewer enthralled. The cinematography here is flawless, the music suitable and moving. It's a rare treat to watch a film that has such beauty, yet is so dark, but crafted with such fine detail. Chan-Wook Park is a master of his craft. The acting here is pretty top-notch, however the one big problem I had with this film was that the characters seemed mostly wooden and the film lacked from having a little more emotion. With that being said this has been one of the better films of the year so far. Not as good as 'Oldboy' but a nicely conceived thriller. Rating: 8 out of 10",Stoker

I fell asleep before that and I refuse to waste more time finishing it. I'm normally not especially impatient and I like a good suspense movie, but to quote cinecritic2517: ""It is obvious from the get-go that the girl and her uncle are psychos, so why limp around aimlessly for two hours getting a point across that couldn't have been made more clear already 10 minutes into the film?"" I appreciated a few interesting shots, the photographer seems to know his business, but for the most part, this is a film where you keep waiting for something transcendent to happen and it takes way too long to happen. Some scenes are a complete waste of film. If you're a hypnotized drooler in front of a screen, you might want to watch this one. If you like intelligent plots, stay away.",Stoker

164,Buscatcher,The guy sat next to me was laughing. Maybe he has a freezer in his actual kitchen as well.,3,3 March 2013,"This is the first time i have put my thoughts on a movie 'on paper' something i hope to keep doing throughout the year and maybe even beyond if i can be arsed. I want to base my reviews on whether a film is worth walking to a bus stop, paying the fare, travelling to Cineworld (other cinemas are available) and coughing up your hard earned. Hence my username. Anyway here goes. This gets a 3 rather than 1 because after 20 minutes I was set to gather my coat and leave but something kept me in my seat. Having endured this poorly scripted excuse for entertainment I cannot figure out what that something was. I'm guessing it must be subliminal; I shall try and elaborate. Firstly I wanted to see this movie because of the trailer which really struck a chord especially the use of Death in Vegas' song Dirge (the irony of which I now appreciate) which never made an aural appearance anyway. Secondly how could a project have the same director as Oldboy star Ms Kidman, Mia Wassername and Mathew Goode with a bit part from Jacki Weaver not deliver. It was these components that kept me from catching an earlier bus home. Around about the time I decided I was going to stick it out I noticed the guy sat two seats along from me laughing which he did on six or seven occasions. This set me going and I found myself belly laughing at two of the more ridiculous scenes in this stinker. If you want to watch a movie length episode of The Twilight Zone, or want to see Mia Wassername playing with herself in the shower whilst fantasising over a murder, then by all means get on the bus. So was Stinker sorry Stoker worth the bus trip? No. If you haven't seen this flick and by some strange quirk are offered a chauffeured limo' to the cinema ask to be dropped off at your local hostelry and invest your tenner getting bladdered. A final point I live in a 1 bed flat that would fit in one of the bedrooms in the house in this movie, and yet I've still managed to fit a freezer in my kitchen.",Stoker
165,charliejsch,Damn right insulting to the human race.,1,4 November 2013,"*Spoilers*My girlfriend put this movie on, so I had no prior knowledge of this movie. I kept on thinking throughout the movie that there is some supernatural twist, some mystical twist, something hidden; boy was I wrong. To summarize this piece of garbage: they're all nuts.The mother is such a useless character that has temper tantrums and does nothing all day. The brother's real character is that of a child. The main character is shallow and shows no emotion. I can't relate to any of these characters. The moral of the story, if there is one, is a grim one at best.This horrendous movie really upset me. The acting was okay for the characters they were playing, the cinematography kept me in suspense. However, I couldn't relate to anyone. Nearly every character was out to get her, as though she was always the victim. It seems as if there is a hidden secret behind her motives and mysterious past, yet, when it comes down to it there is nothing; only a sour taste for the viewer when this disaster ends.Stoker only shows how how human beings can murder, and how easy they can get away with it. At least make the bad guy funny, or give them a reason to do what they do.If you hate humanity in some way, you love this movie.",Stoker
166,FlixChatter,"Stoker definitely works as a cerebral, atmospheric psychological thriller",7,18 March 2013,"In case you didn't know this already, 'Stoker' is Chan-Wook Park's English language debut. It's not only a first for Park, this is also Prison Break's Wentworth Miller's debut screenplay. I'd say he's quite a talented writer. The film centers on India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska), who's mourning the sudden death of her father. As if that is not a major life-changing event for the reclusive teen, her uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode) who she never knew existed now comes to live with her and her unstable mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman). Right of the bat we know there is something strangely peculiar about Charlie and India thinks so too, right from the moment she noticed him standing on a hill at her dad's funeral. The Stokers certainly gives a whole new meaning to dysfunctional family, one that'd make your blood turns cold.Much to India's chagrin, Evelyn seems to be fascinated by her long-lost brother-in-law who claims he's been traveling all over the world. India is naturally suspicious of Charlie, and he gives every reason for her to be with his creepy mannerism and frequent glances towards her. Initially, she tries to ignore his unhealthy attention, but Charlie is quite relentless. Despite the warning of one family member, Evelyn doesn't mind her brother in-law staying with them and let's just say Charlie intends to keep it that way, and would stop at nothing to keep his secret safe. I'm going to stop giving you the synopsis as the less you know about the plot the better. Not that Park is too concerned about plot twists however, I feel that he's more interested in building a certain state of mind for the audience as they watch things unfold.To say this movie is unsettling would be a giant understatement. The sinister atmosphere practically ricochet off the high ceilings of the secluded woodsy estate where the Stokers live. The tension intensifies every time Charlie appears and Park is able to establish suspense with minimal frills. Even the seemingly ordinary event such as two people playing the piano or having dinner is so eerie and you're at the edge of your seat waiting just what's going to happen. Even the humorous parts are not without tension, such as the part when the Ray-Ban-wearing Charlie stalks India on her way home from work in his black convertible whilst the girls on her school bus are giggling and fawning over him.A few reviewers say this film is not as bloody as Park's other films and I'm certainly glad for that most of the violence happen off screen. That's not to say there are no brutal scenes, it's certainly not in short supply for my taste, but it's not so gory that it makes my stomach churn. What really strikes me about Park's direction is his creative camera angles and how he frames the scene. It's truly a gorgeous film and beautifully-shot by Park's longtime-collaborator Chung-hoon Chung, both clearly have such keen eye for detail that enhance the mysterious ambiance of the film. There are also some interesting metaphors used here, such as the choice of Charlie's car, a Jaguar, seems to signify that he's a predator on the lookout for his next prey.Clint Mansel's foreboding score also works very well here, I quite enjoy the classically-tinged music used throughout. The music certainly enhances the mood, but it also plays a role in the story. There is one memorable scene where Charlie and India playing piano together that perfectly captures the disturbing nature of their relationship.The three main actors did an excellent job, particularly Wasikowska who manages to be convincing as a 17-year-old despite being five years older than her character. The talented Australian has this otherworldly presence that is perfect for the role and she has proved to be a capable leading lady. Goode is so perfectly creepy as Charlie, his preppy good looks makes him all the more menacing. I read that Colin Firth had been cast in the role but dropped out, I actually think Goode's youthfulness is perhaps more suitable for the role than Firth, plus he resembles Dermot Mulroney who plays Mia's late father Richard, who appears only in flashbacks. Kidman's icy demeanor is put to good use in depicting a selfish and detached mother. I like the International flavor of the film. The director and cinematographer are Korean, the composer, screenwriter and lead actor are from the UK and the two main actresses are Australian.Being that this is my first Chan-wook Park's film I saw, I'd say I'm quite impressed with his direction and style. I do think that the filmmaker perhaps place aesthetics above narrative that it felt like the film's on the brink of style-over-substance. It's also a cold film that appeals more for the brain but little for the heart as all the characters are impossible to root for. That said, Stoker definitely works as a cerebral, atmospheric psychological thriller. Thriller fans looking for a spooky and suspenseful roller-coaster ride should not be disappointed.– review by ruth @flixchatter.net",Stoker
167,EugeneOL,Need a rewatch,8,20 April 2020,"This is the first film that Park Chan-wook has made in the english language(though he did not write the script). Often, when a foreign director makes a film in English it can end up feeling horribly sterile and uninteresting in comparison to their native language films. I am glad that I can at least confidently say that this is not the case for ""Stoker""; if nothing else, it is unique and well-crafted.That being said, I could totally understand the perspective of one who claims this film to be either a work of genius or total garbage. Some of the performances are odd, but they are clearly laced with subtlety. At many points, characters say certain things, act in certain ways and do certain things that feel bizarre or out of place, and it's not always clear what the film is trying to communicate. To the best of my knowledge, Elizabeth is a disinterested mother who had grown distant with her husband and daughter, and after the incident, holds her daughter in contempt. India seems to be extremely on edge, self-isolating and antipathic, likely due to her acute senses(something she has in common with Charlie).Matthew Goodman as Charlie, though, delivers an unquestionably brilliant performance as a psychopathic menace. Admittedly, some of the lines he is given sound extremely off, but he still manages to communicate his threatening nature in a subtle way.The cinematography, as would be expected of a Park film, is brilliant; however, the technical aspect that stands out the most to me is the editing. Even parts that might otherwise be boring are carried by some extremely creative editing. It is often said that a film is made or broken by its presentation, and ""Stoker"" truly underscores this.Overall, I remain ambivalent on this film because of some choices in the script, but I feel as though it was well worth my time.",Stoker
168,emeraldorc,Doesn't let its genre down,8,8 June 2013,"If you are use to movies like Old Boy and Lady Vengeance, then this is nothing new. It combines great cinema artistry and disturbing themes like its predecessors. It is shocking but artistically beautiful. The film was more about the director showing off his skills behind the camera, creating a feeling in the audience of nervousness and restless by simply getting a clock to tick. I was sitting still throughout the movie, the whole movie was like one nervous on the edge seen. There was a sigh of relief when the film ended. The negatives are really in theme itself, films like this contribute to our warped modern society. There was also a little bit too much iconography for my taste. My art historian wife loved it and kept saying, ""Do you know why they did that scene?"" Mia Wasikowska! I know her from Defiance, one of my favourite movies. She was clearly suited for the role, Nicole Kidman's performance was also very good. The dolly roles really work for her. All in all a great Chan film.

Nicole Kidman plays an idiot, as she going off on her diatribe of why she had kids, I was yawning, and I noticed the guy a row away was sleeping. Dialogue between characters was weak, Uncle Charlie looked wide eyed and crazy the whole time, surprise, he just came out of a loony bin and has this weird fixation on his niece (which never makes sense at all).Good luck if you want to see it, I recommend highly you do not, we went as we saw it had 7.6 on IMDb, we were upset we trusted this rating system.

172,bevanmortimer,"Great idea for a film, but fizzles out.....",6,18 July 2014,"After the death of Richard Stoker in a bizarre car accident, his brother Charlie (Matthew Goode) comes to stay with Richard's family for an extended period. Charlie is a bit of an enigma, from his initial appearance we are left in no doubt there is a dark secret lurking in his past and he is not all he seems to be. Most of the film is viewed through the eyes of India (Mia Waskowska), Richard's daughter. India has a distrust of her uncle from the beginning, after all until now she didn't know she had an uncle. Her mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman) is more trusting and seems to be falling in love, or at least in lust with him.India discovers that the housekeeper knows something of Charlie's history. But instead of confronting her, she seemingly ignores it - despite her desperately wanting to know more of the stranger in their midst. India and Charlie's relationship is a very strange one. At one point it is almost incestuous, at others hateful and at some points reminiscent of Bonnie and Clyde.The film develops with various plot twists and surprises, all of which add to the tension. But the twists get gradually more and more bizarre and less believable. The film's final act is completely unrealistic ultimately giving the film an unrealistic and empty feeling. There are many good films through the years that have great promise but ultimately fail to deliver. In my opinion this is certainly one of those. It's still a film worth watching, the cinematography is wonderful, the acting is at times very good, Wasikowsksa in particular. But, the second half of the film is all a bit of a let down.",Stoker

Acting : I think Nicole was defeated almost to her role as a lazy flirty mother but in the film you will see she pretended as if she was not satisfied with her husband and falling love on Charlie ensured us that she was connected to the mysterious death to her husband. I didn't like her acting. Mia tried to complete her critical and lead role but the disintegrated and unusually critical attempt of director made her failed, I appreciated her acting. Goode was successful to his role, I liked his acting. Other supporting roles are well. Direction : Everything was perfect except the last distinguished and disintegrated scene . I think it could be better, but overall I liked the combination and flashback, mixing the events , biography. I will rate 7.4 for the direction. Music : Nice one.

174,Cjalln1,Style over substance,8,2 November 2015,"""Stoker"" is as weird as a film can get without being classed as art- cinema. As someone who relishes dark plot lines and creepy twists, I wasn't put off by the premise, i.e. a young girl's feelings for her enigmatic uncle in the aftermath of her father's death. ""Stoker"" embodies a very Gothic style thanks to the brooding country house, dark clothing and macabre subject matter.The cinematography and symbolism were evidently the director's main focus: obscure camera angles capture close-ups of shoes, belts, faces, all fraught with symbolism. The plot itself, although original, is not the stand-out characteristic, being marginally too predictable and sensationalised. That said, there were several small events which I didn't anticipate, which added to the tense atmosphere of the claustrophobic house. Small, insignificant sounds are heightened in the film, both to imply India's ability to notice things that others don't, and to imply the tiny peculiarities of the Stoker family. It's this attention to minute detail which makes the film stand out above similar films.The music is at once sweeping and minimal, reflecting the sinister atmosphere. Were it not for the use of cell phones, it would be hard to place ""Stoker"" in a specific time zone - the Gothic atmosphere and the house's isolation mean that it could even be set within the frame of Grant Wood's ""American Gothic"" painting. The film is effective in making subtle jibes at American culture, from mid-US suburbia to high school chauvinism.The effectiveness of ""Stoker"" relies on its under-the-surface creepiness, and the wondrous performances of all 3 main actors portray it perfectly. Nicole Kidman is the bereaved, neurotic typical mother; Mia Wasikowska the morbid introverted teenage weirdo; and Matthew Goode the charming but mysterious and unknown uncle; all 3 are hiding dark internal thoughts which are revealed as the story unfolds.Despite some predictability in the plot, ""Stoker"" remains a dark and atmospheric drama film with an undeniable subtlety of tone.",Stoker

And here's why: I loved the images captured with the camera - great framing, great color - it all set up an atmosphere that was palpable - if you let yourself perceive it. Not to mention the sound, which was a great part of the experience - the movie. And the acting! Mia Wasikowska is superb in this. The mixture of innocence and sexiness was delivered by her in a very inoffensive way ... a different sort of 'coming of age'.I'd summarise the movie this way: disturbing, sexually charged, dark and thought-provoking.Loss of innocence portrayed in a very different way.",Stoker

""Stoker"" doesn't exist in a normal, everyday reality - it's more of an alternative dream reality, hyper-aware and sexually charged. The three principle actors are superb, but Mia Wasikowska really gives the film a beating heart, as she emerges from her innocence into her latent self - a mesmerizing performance. This movie is filled with images that are as disturbing as they are lyrical and open to endless interpretation (along with a subversive wit). I've seen the film multiple times and find that my impressions change with each viewing and that it has really haunted my imagination. ""Stoker"" is one of those unique and mysterious masterpieces that I'm sure I will be returning to frequently over the years - there's much to drink in, as the well runs deep.",Stoker
178,jchodyka-712-409893,"If ""House beautiful"" was a movie",5,26 September 2013,"My first reaction after seeing this movie was to give it low rating for lame script, confusing plot, lazy dialogues and lack of point. People killing each other because they are psychopaths - so what? Haven't we all seen hundreds of movies like that? But then I stopped myself from dismissing it as a total waste of precious time of viewers just on the account of visual effects. As a matter of fact, sometime into 20 minutes of trying to follow the plot when I exactly knew when it was heading to, I completely concentrated on aesthetics: interiors, clothes, food, landscaping,constant retro references ... and I said to myself that perhaps we are on the verge of a new form of film making and what if I miss that point. I may look like those fools from the past who thought that Jazz was the vulgar music of unsophisticated people, or some other losers who didn't get Warhol. Maybe we are witnessing the birth of something totally new and need to be open despite of initial reaction. The movie certainly lacks traditional requirement of decent storytelling but is a filmed series of vignettes reminding me of similar artistically arranged photos of super slim models of both sexes photographed in splendid places in posh interior decoration or so called life style magazines such as ""Vogue"" or ""Wallpaper"" or something like that. So I would recommend it just for this particular potential of witnessing fusion of everything with anything just for the sake of exploring new forms even if the point of it is still not quite clear.",Stoker
179,TheDelusionist,Park Chan-wook's Stoker (2013),7,8 June 2013,"India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska) is a moody teenager from a privileged family living in the lush countryside of the United States. Her pleasant and uneventful life is suddenly turned upside down when her father Richard (Dermot Mulroney) is killed in a car accident. India is left with her apathetic mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman) and no one to console her, until her long-lost, creepy uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode) shows up. While the not-really-grieving widow seems to appreciate her odd, but attractive brother-in-law's presence, he seems to be hiding terrible family secrets under his strange smirk.A South Korean director like Park Chan-wook (Oldboy and Thirst) working in Hollywood – in a different culture with an English-speaking cast and writer (and producers) – doesn't seem like an ideal fit at first. This is somewhat confirmed here. It's always difficult to translate Asian sensibilities and cultural traits into an American film. Actor turned writer Wentworth Miller pens a story that resembles Korean fare, but he may still be a diamond in the rough as far as his screen writing abilities go, especially in the character development department. The lack of compelling writing is partly overcome by a great cast, Wing Lee's inspired art direction and Chung Chung-hoon's splendid cinematography. The use of Stride la vampa from Giuseppe Verdi's opera Il Trovatore (1853), is another delight of Stoker.The way Park is able to capture and compliment Mia Wasikowska's astonishingly beautiful face, by frame only certain details, like her mouth, needs to be commended. Pulling off the whole weirdo-creep teenager thing, without making the character completely unlikable, is never easy: Stoker mostly succeeds thanks to Mia's committed performance. It remains a mystery how much of the awkward atmosphere is intentional. The film tries to sustain the weird tone for too long, stretching out the story unnecessarily before making its point. Again, what Park was going for might work in a South Korean film, but like Nicole Kidman's character it feels out of place here. The ""big reveal"", the climax of the film is rather unsatisfying and cliché. The film also seems to be heavily influenced by The Uninvited (2009), the American remake of A Tale of two Sisters (2003), both aesthetically and narratively. Surely the producing Scott brothers might have something to do with it, in their effort to make the film marketable.Overall I recommend Stoker if you like brightly lit psychological thrillers and horror films; of course Park Chan-wook fans should check this one out; also if you like Carrie (1976), Ginger Snaps (2000) and May (2002) a film like Stoker might just be up your alley.",Stoker
180,smijatov89,Visually mesmerising,7,22 July 2013,"Stoker definitely fulfilled my expectations, though I had not really watched any of the previous work by Park. I did expect some visual mastery, that is exactly what I got. The film is visually mesmerising, providing us with innumerable beautiful shots. Really, each shot can be a still photograph on its own right. It is simply stunning the amount of work this must have demanded, so the director did a superb job. The casting was great, too since everyone's performance was excellent, especially young Mia Wasikowska. The story is interesting, too, and while not necessarily the strong point of the film, it is sufficiently good not to be a let down. Overall, it is a good debut for Park who should have gotten more recognition for this. 7/10",Stoker
181,whatalad,A decent first Hollywood picture from the director of Oldboy,6,17 March 2013,"The English debut feature from Oldboy director Chan-wook Park has a lot going for it as far a style and technique is concerned, but this cast and crew deserve a better film to showcase their talents than the film Stoker ultimately ends up being.In fact there is so much to recommend in Stoker to anyone who appreciates and revels in watching a director tell their story, the film is a minor masterpiece of independent film making during its first hour. The story is so dark, tense, and saturated in repressed sexual desires and sexual awakenings that the audiences has no idea where the film will take them or what the motivations are for any of these lonely characters to be with each other. We just know that something isn't right when the uncle of India Stoker comes to live with her and her mother just after her father's funeral.During this first hour, Park shows off a perfectly controlled display of a static and moving camera, off-centre framing and empty spaces, and unsettlingly shots of everyday activities; when has putting ice cream in a freezer looked as eerie as it does here? Park, unlike so many directors making American films, doesn't copy any style to make his film seem familiar to his audience (slow mo, shaky camera, sweeping aerial shots) but does draw attention to the fact that his camera movement is purposeful but never careless. It's a joy to watch this man direct because he really knows how to tell a story through the camera.The dialogue is playful and dangerous, often alluding to a sexual desire or foreboding actions and is delivered by the excellent cast without it ever coming across as unnatural or uncharacteristic of whoever is speaking. This is, until the final third when, like so many films which leave the audience in the dark for so long, the eventual exposition comes flooding through and drowns out the tightly wound film it had become. Whilst maintaining a spoiler-free review, what was once a story told through dark, Gothic visuals becomes a exercise in cramming in as much backstory and flashbacks as possible to make sense of what's come before; the pace changes, the visuals become clichéd (spurting red blood on white flowers, reflections in Aviator sunglasses) and the film loses credibility in favour for a shock ending which it simply doesn't need.Stoker is a good dry run for Park's career in American cinema and he's showed what he can do with a western cast and setting, and has chosen a superb set of actors to help him realise his obvious technical prowess for this story. There is a lot of good in this film is you just enjoy the beauty of a good director at work, but anyone expecting a story of equal enjoyment will be slightly disappointed at the end.",Stoker
182,ReeseCormac,Combination mystery and art film,8,20 December 2019,"If you like mysteries and enjoy deciphering visual symbolism, ""Stoker"" should appeal to you.Devastated by her father's death, high-school senior India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska) attends the funeral party gathered for refreshments at the family's country estate, where she meets Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), her father's younger brother who she never knew existed. India's Aunt Gwendolyn (Jacki Weaver) and family friend Mrs. McGarrick (Phyllis Somerville) know Charlie all too well, however, and are deeply upset that he has reappeared in their lives. The basis for their fear is the mystery that the film gradually unravels.Handsome, suave Uncle Charlie has an interest in India that seems more than avuncular. He also has an eye for India's mother Evelyn (Nicole Kidman), whose pampered, privileged life has left her unprepared to be anything more than the perfect hostess.

The dialog is stilted and stagy.The film thinks it's thought provoking and daring, but we've seen it all done before and much better. The only reason these actors could have done this film is because of the usually exciting director - who clearly let his actors down this time. Maybe something was lost in translation...This is a thriller done lite, boring and not in the least bit thrilling.

I was particularly enraptured by the two protagonists - India Stoker and Uncle Charlie.

Can't say enough...just see this film.A gorgeous, twisted, hypnotic trance of a film - it's meant for an audience not overly concrete in it's thinking but who have an open imagination and are able to take the plunge into the dark vision of Chan Wook-Park. The three principle actors are superb but Mia Wasikowska really gives the film a beating heart, as her character, India Stoker, emerges from her innocence into her latent self, her true nature. This movie is filled with images that are as disturbing as they are lyrical and open to endless interpretation. I've seen the movie three times in theaters and find that my impressions change with each viewing and that it has really haunted my imagination. ""Stoker"" is one of those unique and mysterious masterpieces that I'm sure I'll be returning to frequently over the years - it's as beautiful and poetic as it's nasty and sick.

189,Apex_P38,"Chan-wook Park's English Language ""Stoker""",8,2 March 2013,"As one of my most anticipated movies of 2013, I went to see Stoker on it's opening Friday with nothing but great expectations. Being a die-hard fan of Chan-wook Park's movies also had me excited to see his first English language effort that as I sat in that theater from the very first moment I watched this film without favoritism or preconceptions. By the end, this movie still reached my expectations but I left the theater replaying how it unfolded over and over in my head for the rest of the day.At the funeral of her father's death, India (played by Mia Wasikowska) for the first time meets and learns of the existence of her uncle Charlie. As charming and ominous Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode) seems to India, early on he seeks her friendship. Still India seems suspicious of him and his sudden reemergence to which slowly starts to unfold before her. As India slowly uncovers the truth about Uncle Charlie she unexpectedly finds herself drawn to him as not only she opens herself up emotionally but she opens herself up to what makes Uncle Charlie tick.The acting performances on this film are stellar. Mia Wasikowska who I am not a usual fan of, gives an amazing performance as India. Matthew Goode is also a star in the making who should be seen in bigger roles as he's proved in his other previous films (Watchmen, Leap year) and plays a great part on this one as well. Nicole Kidman also shines in all her scenes as a morbid mother to India and plays her role brilliantly. They couldn't have casted for a better cast for this film.Visually, this film is stunning as within the first couple of minutes you will be overwhelmed by this films visual style. Cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung really outdoes himself on this one. Compared to Thirst (2009) this film goes on to be a über ""close up film"" along with a standard usage of longer lenses not previously used in Park's earlier films, giving him perhaps a new visual aesthetics for his next films.This might be Chan-wook Park's first English language film, but this is not your usual Hollywood Thriller/Horror genre flick. Also had this film been shot in South Korea with the same budget and a Korean cast instead, this film might have probably gone over the top to be a quintessential Chan-wook Park film which Stoker did not entirely turn out to be.Don't get me wrong. This film had me throughout the entire movie and it's very well made, but Stoker end up being somewhat of a ""small"" film with a semi-rushed ending that you will see when you watch it. The direction on this film was fine but this is NOT a director's cut film which we usually get from this director and from what I have read online 20 minutes of this film was cut out of the final version for American audiences.Still I would've liked for them to have screened a director's cut of this film at the theaters or something close to it. It's a shame that it's not to say the least, but what can we do? Overall, I almost loved the film but I still really really dug this film and will go on to watch this again and again. I would have preferred for the studio to have allowed Chan-wook Park to make the type of movie he usually makes but this is Hollywood not South Korea. So it is what it is. 8 out of 10 stars.",Stoker
190,dazworthy,"Gorgeous, brutal and eerie. Like being punched in the guts by a beautiful goth",8,6 October 2013,"Hollywood has a history of creating misleading trailers for movies. It seems that when a film is a little left-of-centre, or deals with difficult subjects, they will attempt to ""mainstream"" the movie by making it seem more run-of-the-mill than it actually is. Often this does the film itself a disservice. A few months ago I saw an early trailer for Stoker and was underwhelmed. The trailer made it seem as if it was going to be another teenage drama with supernatural undertones. This could not be further from the truth. The film itself is a gorgeous, brutal and eerie thriller, filled with brilliant direction, cinematography and performances. The film opens with Evelyn (Nicole Kidman) mourning the loss of her husband in a car accident, along with her daughter India (Mia Wasikowska). India takes it particularly hard as she was close to her father, whilst being distant from the rest of her family and peers. The death also introduces an estranged uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode) whom India has not met or even knew of. It soon seems that Charlie's presence constitutes more than simply a mourning brother.Stoker is directed by Chan-wook Park (Old Boy) and is his first English language film. Park's direction is simply brilliant. His mastery of light and sound are something to behold. He also has the ability to combine the minute and the grand, the beautiful and the violent, all in one scene. It is with these vehicles that he creates an eerie foreboding atmosphere that permeates the whole movie.The performances are also first class, particularly Mia Wasikowska. I'm not a huge fan of Nicole Kidman, but her performance is subtle and convincing. And combined with Jackie Weaver, there are some great scenes between the three that show just how important Australian actresses are to Hollywood. Stoker is the most arresting film I've seen for some time. It's a unique, clever and sometimes confronting thriller that keeps you guessing until the end. And despite it's dark content it is also a film of great beauty.",Stoker

It's self-consciously giddy with blatant allusions to Psycho throughout as if the final result could possibly be the same. I thought the most disturbing aspects of this high school, home-ec project is Nicole's 1/2 note performance and awful plastic surgery. I could barely take any more of it's logic holes, nauseating camera spins and numerous Hitchcock visual ripoffs. Over half the film is of actors staring wide-eyed into space.

192,winston9109,Sensational !,10,24 March 2013,"Stoker .. You have here a visionary tale that tended masterfully to every facet of film. Spellbinding source music soaked into a high - saturation canvas, framed so you can feel the psychosis of the characters, often released in the intentional chaos of expertly executed angles. A ""hands on"" type of film, but not without the depth to let your own imagination explore the subject matter's malleable pathos. Movies succeed when they silence the critical voice in your own head, when they reel you in completely, enslaving you. When a movie is your master it can do anything to you, as this one does. The twist is both the diabolical and disturbing type you will not soon extricate, as it will likely permeate and fester in your consciousness and conversation. Not for the faint of heart or easily nauseated. The movie, however, is beautiful, and India is a heroine in every sense of the world. It bares supernatural undertones without unraveling in that particular industry. In the film's center focus are bold and traditional concepts of sexual repression, nature vs. nurture, and the inextricable bonds of beauty, blood and earth. Ultimately both mind-blowing and bending with a wholly original deliverance, films like Stoker only pass through the cinemas once or twice a year, if that. Don't miss it. The acting is seamless. The ending is absolutely killer.",Stoker
193,moh_hamade96,A psychopathic drama? Not categorized under the horror genre? A kind of movie where the pro-stokers would argue its placement in either the top 10 or top 15 movies of 2013.,7,3 July 2013,"A psychopathic drama? Not categorized under the horror genre? Still works! A kind of movie where the pro-stokers would argue its placement in either the top 10 or top15 movies of 2013. Stoker is Chan-wook Park latest project revolving around a family who have just lost the father to a car accident; leaving India Stoker –played by Mia Wasikowska- and Evelyn stoker –played by Nicole Kidman- fatherless and husband-less. The family, then, is surprised by the presence of the father's brother , Charles- played by Matthew Goode- as his existence was unknown to the family. He pays them a visit at the funeral is welcomed to stay for a while by the widowed Evelyn and on with the drama.This is a kind of movie where the anti-stoker fans would associate their arguments with the assertion of constant gloominess, coldness and ghosty mood! The point is not debatable as it is indeed a hiccup in the movie. The mood might be intentionally set by the screenwriter and the art directors, but it shouldn't have been the direction taken. There were moments when a character was asked a question and took ages to answer. No indication that the character wishes not to answer but the conversation was normal. The characters were in sorrow, and those moments should be there but not continuously and used consistently as the default mood of the movie. With that mood I saw no issue with the general character profiling of the movie; even though the character of Charles might have felt to be artificial at times, and India too gloomy. Nonetheless it was generally acceptable. The character Evelyn was probably the empirical and the reason why character profiling's case in this movie is arguable. A mother that hasn't been a proper mother-figure for India, and a wife that needs to let go of her emotions. She was attracted by Charles and tried to drag India with her (not literally off course.)The art direction and editing made it so amusing to watch. There were no special effects in the script nor it was needed, but the shift from scene to scene was done so artistically. The scene where India is combing her mother's hair and the camera movies down the hair and suddenly changes into a tree (again not literally;) moving to another scene in the woods. Those magnificent shots were maintained perfectly and did not exceed the limit. And yes I am hinting at an Oscar nomination!Another noteworthy aspect of the movie was the unpredictability and not knowing what (writer) has in store for us later. I'm not saying that it's a 'Christopher Nolan' type of thriller, it's thrilling in a way where the chain of events of a family are unpredictable, and not on a grand scale. Speaking of chain of events, in this movie it's quite noticeable that 'chain' isn't in their dictionary. A step by step handling of the scenes apparently is old fashioned in this movie. The bathroom scene where India's taking a a bath; the scene begins with a towel spread on the floor. Then she enters the bathroom then we see that she is spreading the sheet. That particular instant didn't have a significant impact on the film, but it is used widely throughout the movie. adding a new touch to the movie. that defines 'sitting on the edge of your seat;' in fact the opening moments of the movie is a flash forward.If you don't want a horror movie but enjoy a family thriller; then stoker is your movie!",Stoker
194,g-boyle3,Stoker is a gem,8,13 July 2013,"This was a very cool movie, unique in its fashion. The director Park - Chan Wook (old boy) made a rather smooth transition into English language film with this debut. The story wasn't all that intelligent, however the nature of it was sufficiently dark and perilous enough to shock its viewers. It was fairly predictable, obvious from the beginning that something sinister was going on yet it prevailed as an interestingly brilliant film. It was set at a suitable pace that left me craving that little bit more from every scene. The director couldn't help but indulge in some extravagant camera work that we are all too familiar with in Asian film. It gave some of the scenes and the overall film that extra dosage of substance it needed to be a success. It's a sick, twisted, beautiful nightmare that gripped me from the beginning and didn't let go until the end credits. Mathew Goode and Mia Wasikowska were phenomenal in their roles. They really captured the intriguing nature of their characters and gave stellar performances. This is the kind of movie you will love but you may not want anyone else knowing it. A disturbing masterpiece that left me truly satisfied.",Stoker

196,djinn667,Introverted & Engaging,8,4 July 2013,"A girl walks across a road. She's wearing her Father's Belt and her Mother's blouseshe's looking out into a fieldand this pretty much sets the tone for the entire film.Stoker is very much a slow burner, but an intriguing and engaging film all the same. We follow India Stoker, an introverted soul, mourning the loss of her father, living with her mother in a large house. It's not until her Uncle turns up, to throw the family into a subtle disarray, that we start to see their family life unfolding.Charles Stoker is besotted with India, taking a very keen interest in her in a way which constantly feels awkward and a little bit wrong, whilst forging a friendship with his Brother's widow.But it's India's character arc which is the main focus, and what a journey she goes on. I cannot say too much about her character without giving too much away about where the film goes, you'll just have to watch it for yourself.Director Chan-wook Park delivers a visual spectacle, with long sweeping camera shots, swift angle changes and a very typically clear colour palate to bring everything together. India is surrounded by blacks & whites and greys whilst her Mother is very much enveloped in a mustard and light orange glow, which fits in well with Nicole Kidman's hair colour.The script is also well written, and Prison Break's Wentworth Miller clearly knows his craft well, bringing a very slick text to these characters.Stoker is not a drift-in, drift-out movie, it's a ""watch and see what happens"" type, driven by great cinematography and dialogue. Matthew Goode's Charlie is sinister even when he's being nice, and Mia Wasikowska's downplayed part comes across well.Chan-wook Park brought us one of the greatest Korean films ever in ""Oldboy"" and he definitely delivers in this, his first ever English Spoken film.Enjoy!",Stoker
197,lisa-ravenclaw,A dark and inventive subversion of coming of age stories,8,13 July 2016,"The dead man's daughter is the only one who notices the stranger. He is standing some distance away from the funeral, watching her. Later, at the reception, her mother is immediately charmed. 'India,' she beams, 'come and say hello to your uncle Charlie'. The stranger turns around, smiling.What follows is a dark and inventive subversion of the coming-of-age genre, as eighteen year old India realises that there is something menacing about this uncle that she never knew existed, and that it is precisely this suggestion of the dangerous which draws her to him. 'Have you ever seen a photograph of yourself,' she explains, 'taken from an angle you don't get to see when you look in the mirror. And you think, that's me! That's also me!' In her father's younger brother India finds echoes of herself, and what she comes to understand about the two of them both fascinates and disturbs her.This tension of being attracted to something that you know is wrong is masterfully expressed through a camera which keeps zooming in as it moves away, and zooming out as it draws closer. Like India, we linger when we should be leaving. We hesitate as we approach. And the images that we see on screen are very beautiful, showing us the world from an original, compelling point of view. The opening of an eye is matched to the opening of a piano lid. Long hair transforms into long grass waving in the wind.What you end up thinking of Stoker largely depends on whether or not you agree with something Oscar Wilde said (about books, but he was writing before film was invented). According to Wilde, 'there is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written or badly written. That is all.' To say that Stoker is a well shot film is an understatement, but the subject matter that it renders so beautifully is as perverse as can possibly be. Violence is not only aestheticised, but sexualised. And those compelled to hurt others are presented as unique, almost elite human beings. 'I wonder if you too' Charlie tells his niece, 'can hear what others cannot hear, see what they cannot see'. Blood drips off small white flowers.Worst of all, Stoker ultimately concludes that destructive urges run in your blood – for India's mother is an outcast who can never truly belong to the family that she married into – and that the mature thing to do is to give up individual agency and simply accept your own biological determinism: 'Just as a flower does not choose its colour, we are not responsible for what we have come to be,' India whispers in the opening monologue. 'Only once you realise this do you become free. And to become adult, is to become free'.Nevertheless, I think those who decry Stoker for glorifying violence are missing the point. Chan-wook Park's film is really about seduction, and it is us the viewers who are being seduced. Wilde was writing at a time when an 'immoral book' was simply one with a hint of sex. Today, sex is all over the screen, and the bar for immorality is lower. But seduction is at its most thrilling if it has an element of transgression. What can a film still show us nowadays that, to our dismay, makes us realise that we like what we see? I suggest you watch Stoker for yourself and find out. I for one enjoyed it immensely.",Stoker
198,chrisx18240,Park in English is a win!,8,27 September 2013,"Stoker So this is a film review for Stoker and will contain no spoilers for the film, there are very certain moments in this film you will want to see without any previous knowledge. To start I would love to give major credit to Mr. Wentworth Miller for an amazing script, and this being his first script, he did an incredible job. With that said I would love to read his script, and then the version that was used after director Chan-wook Park got his hands on it. Anyone who had any worries or trepidation about him switching to an English language film set them aside. This has the feeling, look, tone, pace, and feeling of a Park film. This is also not to say Park made the script better, in the sense that it was mediocre before, but I think it would be lovely to see the changes he made to try and pry into his process and creativity. Since I am going to avoid details and plot points I am going to explain why I felt this was a Park film even though it was in English. The first major giveaway is still shots. Yes, these foreboding and beautifully placed still frame shots make their mark on the film, and only after you have seen the whole movie, twice in my opinion, do you begin to gather the weight they carry. Another major device is camera movement. There is just a specific way he likes to move and place his camera on his subjects, and this holds true in this film. From movement, placement, focus, angle, and height the camera is specific to each character and flows with their emotions. There is also recurring imagery. I will not give the specifics away, because it is half the fun discovering them yourself, but several small and large pieces of imagery show up multiple times in the film and interact with the characters and story in important ways. As in most Park films there is little dialogue. This may be more of one of his most severe cases, in that very little is said in the movie, but when characters do speak, the weight and power of their words are unmistakable. There was never a scene or moment where I felt I needed someone to say something, there was a genuine flow of dialogue that fit the mood and essence of the film. Just to be clear Park does not venture into Malick or Refn territory here with almost no dialogue, there is just less than most Hollywood films. The other big one for me are the characters. When I go to watch a Park film I have this preconceived notion that I am about to meet some very severe characters. Whether they are crazy, mad, vengeful, sad, or romantic I know that the characters in a Park film will not be there just to fill the screen. In Stoker there are very few characters, but they are all very big and complex people. One character in particular had me guessing the whole time, and it was not until the movie was over was I slightly sure I may have figured her out. To review this movie as a whole; the directing and cinematography were on the same level as some of Park's best work. All the actors are exceptional, and I do not say that lightly. These few actors have lots of screen time and very little supporting actors, so you are constantly focusing on the main three, and they do not disappoint, for me Nicole Kidman gives the best performance. I will put this last bit out there if you do not know a lot about this movie be warned; it is not a happy smiles and rainbows type of film. It is has a measured pace, does not shy away from violence, and the mood is extremely dark. However, there is plenty of room for enjoyment while watching this film, it is not so dark you want to go home and cry afterwards. If you have never seen a Chan-wook Park film go watch Oldboy right now, if you are a fan of his work Stoker will not disappoint.

I fail to see the importance, poetry or necessity of such a scene other than to make the viewer stop watching the film. In retrospect I must admit I should have stopped watching right then and there.The films title is misleading because it has nothing to do with stokers, its just India's surname which by itself is imo lame. Stoker is the story of a mentally disturbed girl India, who is getting more psychotic when her father mysteriously dies. Then she meets her uncle, a violent psychopath who enjoys brutally murdering people he ""loves"" and has a weird and unexplained fixation with her. Together they discover how much fun killing is. Finally India after discovering that her beloved uncle has slaughtered most of her family decides to go away with him, but at the last minute changes her mind, shoots him and goes away on her own, starting her own murderous mayhem. What is the point of this horrible movie?? An epic waste of time. Why do I have to watch a girl jerking off with strangling someone?

Rarely have I watched anything so utterly empty and devoid of purpose.The film tries so hard to be weird, suspenseful and disturbing, and it fails in all these respects. The characters in Stoker would have to be among the flattest ever to grace the screen. They are boring, every one of them, every single one, and not at any point during this film did I remotely care what would happen to them.

203,ianfarkas9,"Stoker: everything you love about Park-Chan Wook movies, just dialed down a couple notches",8,21 January 2013,"As a fan of Chan-Wook Park's Korean films, particular his gross twist on a vampire story in 2009's Thirst, I was incredibly excited to see his first English language offering. Stoker, the first film made stateside by CWP, defiantly doesn't disappoint. This is largely due to the director staying with what he knows, telling a story that has all the dark hallmarks from his Korean works. However, Stoker is also less extreme then one would expect from Chan-Wook Park, as many moments of violence and depravity that could have been much more over the top are toned down. Stoker focuses on the titular family of India, Evelyn, and Richard Stoker (Mia Wasikowska, Nicole Kidman, and Dermot Mulroney). When Richard dies in a mysterious car crash, his oddball daughter India begins to further distance herself from her estranged mother, Evelyn. After burying their patriarch, the family is visited by India's Uncle, Charlie. Charlie seems a little out there, and begins to form a sketchy relationship with India that suggests Uncle Charlie may desire more than family bonding. To elaborate any more would spoil the film, but needless to say it's an interesting premise. The story unfolds very slowly, with few dramatic developments until the second half of the film, which contains much more wizz-bang than the somber and meticulously paced beginning. This isn't a bad thing, largely because the characters are so fascinating from the get-go that accompanying them while they go about their day to day lives is a pleasure. Even when the movie seems to be resting on its laurels early on, the performances are great all around (in particular Wasikowska's performance as distant and on-edge India). Except for a few odd holes, the script stays strong throughout, providing plenty of great dialogue courtesy of Wentworth Miller (you read that right,the dude from Resident Evil: Afterlife. Who saw that coming?). Of course, the strongest link in the chain is Chan-wook Park. From the opening scene of fragmented shots with computer generated transitions that occur throughout the movie, his mark is clearly laid on the film. Stoker never has an ugly moment, and each shot oozes with that distinctive Chan-wook flair. My personal favorite is an early scene in a basement involving a swinging light fixture (think Once upon a time in the West). The only thing that feels absent compared to CWP's other efforts is a slew of neasea-indusing scenes whose only purpose is to shock the audience. Although Stoker has a few jarring moments (think showers), for the most part its very restrained compared to Chan-wook's other works. This is fine up until the last act, when the nature of the story demanded for a more powerful and shocking denouement then what was given. So despite not quite sticking the landing, Stoker is effectively creepy, well acted, and an enjoyable beginning to what I hope will be a long English language career for Chan-wook Park.",Stoker

The movie follows her, and is a bunch of fun to watch. Just like Park's other films there is a hint of comedy in the movie to keep your uneasiness at bay.After a day or two to decompress this movie....I loved it! It was a bunch of fun, and kept me hooked the entire time. I love the directorial style that Chan-wook Park brings to all his movies, they are visual masterpieces to watch. This is Park's English debut, and man did he nail it.I've seen complaints about the story, script, etc. and I have to say...I loved the whole setup. My only complaint was that they introduced a cool aspect to the family that is never explored in the film, and though it comes off as important, never goes anywhere.",Stoker
205,kathyh326,slow and boring and unpretentious,1,21 June 2013,I was ready to watch a good movie but I should have been for warned because it is a typical flop that Nicole Kidman should find herself in. The film starts out boring and gets even more boring as the creepiness starts to settle in... I got a bad feeling something like a bad touch as I continued to watch this film. I would not and will not recommend this film to anyone .. it is slow from start to finish and will leave you feeling as if there was supposed to be something there and there was and it wasn't good. The acting was mediocre and the actors certainly were menacing enough but the movie did not have enough content to hold the audience.

206,MattJJW,"Good, but not great, dark psychological thriller",6,3 March 2013,"This dark psychological thriller scores highly on IMDb (7.9 at the time of writing), but I found it a perplexing and frustrating watch.Directed by Korean director Chan-wook Park (previously best known in the West for the well-received Oldboy) the story, such as it is, revolves largely around India, a young girl, recently bereaved by the loss of her father. When her long lost Uncle returns, events in the family household take a sinister and mysterious turn (with more than a nod to Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt).There are themes of obsession, jealousy, sexual longing and hints of dark family secrets but the motivations for them are never explained or developed. All of the characters are cold, and emotionally closed, making caring for what happens to any of them difficult.Jackie Weaver, one of my favourite supporting actresses, is wasted as Auntie Gwen, who has little more to do than turn up unannounced to a less than warm welcome, say a couple of lines of dialogue, before leaving for a shorter than expected stay in a local hotel.Nicole Kidman, does pretty much what Nicole Kidman does best, mainly just hanging around looking beautiful, brittle but not really emoting much more than a cold, static detachment. To be fair, on this occasion she doesn't really have much to work with, and her performance is in tune with the sombre, repressed tone of the film.There are some things to enjoy, the cinematography is stunning, with some great outdoor location work in the woods and highways that surround the family house. There are several set pieces that are well conveyed, particularly when the Uncle and India play an emotionally charged piano duet.Mia Wasikowska puts in the best performance here as India, conveying both inner emotional turmoil and later in the film, an emerging sexual awareness and yearning. She also is a dab hand with a pencil.While interesting, ultimately, the lack of a coherent plot, or any desire to explain lose ends (the shoes, the key to the drawer), means it falls short of greatness.",Stoker

This movie was a total waste of my time, and I felt sort of angry after watching a piece of crap like this. Come on, couldn't someone have written a better plot or something? Don't we have enough sick people and sadists on earth? How could have a widow fallen for her late husband's brother shortly after the funeral when it seemed like she loved and missed her husband?

The directing and filming of the movie were both unique and aesthetically pleasing. What I liked most about it was the unpredictable plot. India Stoker is a girl with a strong hearing gift. Her uncle Charlie who she never knew about came to live at their house after the death of her father. I wouldn't recommend watching it with someone or with a group just because it's a movie that requires your focus and concentration or you're gonna miss it big time. It's somewhat funny that the whole movie was like a plot twist. Definitely a must-watch!,Stoker
212,joelcairo1941,Contrived and Strained,6,1 March 2015,"The storyline is really contrived, and it strains too much to be artistic and clever but with no purpose. I did appreciate the Hitchcock reference to ""Shadow of a Doubt,"" even to the point of calling the uncle Charlie. In 1943, Hitchcock toyed with the idea of evil that can lurk just on the edges of sunny pleasantness. The niece and uncle are mirror images of each other, but the niece is horrified by the distorted image that looks back at her in the form of her uncle. In the end, good wins out, and we are left to believe that the niece has successfully exorcised any evil that might have been festering inside her psyche by the death of her uncle. Hitchcock had to have such an ending to get past the censors of the day. I suspect he would have liked a much murkier ending.**SPOILER ALERT** Seventy years later writers and directors are not hampered by the constraints of censors and are allowed much more latitude in their creations. All through the movie, the writer and director lead the audience to see India's perverse nature and her taste for killing. Indeed, she has an orgasm thinking about the way her uncle murders her would-be rapist. An ending that would have helped to maintain the integrity of the storyline would have been for India to watch Uncle Charlie kill her mother and then go off with him to become serial killers in an effort to slake both their murderous impulses. I think Hitchcock today would have approved such an ending. Instead, the writer and director use a cop-out ending of good impulses overcoming evil impulses.",Stoker
213,tyluke,Thank you Mr Vengeance!!,9,13 January 2014,"Stoker is director Chan-wook Park (Oldboy & Lady Vengeance..) English language debut. Well worth the wait. He brings a style that is reminiscent of early 60's thrillers to life with Stoker. It is both beautiful and disturbing in nature. In the way of Hitchcock he takes a simple coming-of-age story of a 17 year old girl (Mia Wasikowska) turning into a women of 18 and wraps it into a evil coming alive and ready to unleash on the world ride along that keeps you wanting more. Park is a very stylistic director using visuals and imagery to make his points. The screen play is amazingly written, leaving a lot of interpretation, it does not answer all the plot questions so it leaves that up to the viewer. Please do yourself a favor before watching Stoker, forget that Director Park's nickname is ""Mr. Vengeance"" . You will be disappointed if you are expecting the action-packed, exploding scenes you are used to with Park. This is an escape for him and it is well worth the time to watch.",Stoker

215,potterus_25,stoker - watching born of psychopath,7,23 June 2013,"I've been waiting for this movie since saw the poster.It doesn't live much to my expectation. The plot is not new, and I guess everyone could guess who-is-what. the cinematography is beautiful. but growing up quite familiar with Asia director's work, it's nothing new. not worse nor better.I give 7 as these are kind of psycho characters I root for, a psychotic behavior with a little bit romantic side (in a movie, not real life. that will be too damn scary). Although, Charlie incest-like-obsession with his niece is quite disturbing. And India reaction toward his uncle weird behavior (e.g. piano scene)just wrong. or maybe the writer intentionally make it that way ? It's kinda annoying because the characters become stuck for me. Either thinking them as Dracula-Mina, or Bates-Mother. but it just messed up to mix them all (but again,they are psycho, who need a moral compass ?) Actings are good,but again, the cast already the best. I am glad their cast Mia as India instead of Carey Mulligan. Mulligan is a good actress, but Mia expression-less face practically won the character. Nicole Kidman does not much shine until the end of the movie. and it just perfect, because thru out the film everything focus with the two, and she just swoop in and established her position in 'the family'. a mother who envy her own daughter is psycho enough for me (poor Richard though. what kind of family he live with). Uncle Charlie remind me a lot with Ice Truck Killer character from Dexter (whom I like so much).The twist ending are not so twisted. But I do like the scene when India sit at piano chair, waiting, while a minutes ago her Uncle Charlie also sit there. It's like she's considering, and then make a final decision who she really want to kill.Overall, if looking for thriller with full suspense in every scene,Stoker might not be the one. Stoker is more like a story of 'psycho' telling from its human side.",Stoker

Start with a spider and ends pretty much the same as if this film lay-reason. A special surprise is one of the writers, even the main character in the series ""Prison Break"". It seems that he somehow made ​​its mark because it gives authenticity. They are disturbing images, one of them even shocked me that the girl in this story comes in a shower, at the same time masturbating. In fact, this story has a sexual connotation, rather, sensual. The one that started such a thing is exactly her uncle. It's something unusual, but such films all with the same theme there have been.

217,k-hosni,"Mia Wasikowska gives this film a beating heart, as she emerges from her innocence into her latent self",7,31 January 2016,"Stoker is Park Chan-wook first English-language film, which I found to be more on the tamer side of his usual work. Stoker is a psychological thriller, and the best kind you can ask for. The limited amount of characters and slow pacing of the movie gives the audience time to reflect and peer into the minds of the Stoker family.The story revolves around an 18-year-old girl India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska), whose father dies in a bizarre car wreck. Her Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode), who she never knew existed, comes to live with her and her unstable mother (Nicole Kidman). She begins to suspect this mysterious, charming man has concealed motives and becomes increasingly infatuated with him. The story isn't really that subtle or original but the film is stylishly made with Hitchcockian elements throughout the film. It was quite obvious 10 minutes into the film that the girl and her uncle are psychopaths. Thrillers usually build tension slowly throughout a plot until it gets to a point where everything unravels into a complete different direction. Instead of jump scares or whatever tricks that typical thrillers use, the film rather tests the anxiety of the audience and haunts the imagination. Mia Wasikowska really gives the film a beating heart, as she emerges from her innocence into her latent self. Matthew Goode had a quality about him that reminded me of Norman Bates in Psycho. I was quite surprised to find that the story was written by Wentworth Miller (Prison Break). This is he's first written and produced film on the big screen. I look forward to seeing more of his theatrical work including a prequel story to Stoker about the life of Uncle Charlie.",Stoker
218,zuhair_v,Poetry through film,8,10 June 2013,"It takes long to shrug off 'Stoker, 2013'. Having followed most of the director's films this is yet another omnibus in praise of Chan-wook Park and his forward thinking filming techniques; a method, where it leaves the concrete viewer wondering, smiling in the afterglow of movies he creates. This visual-stunner is a masterpiece, moving back and forth, in long shots that take you into the film's past,deliberately confusing at first but gradually making you realize the stroke of the brushes with which Chan-wook has painted this canvas. The only movie that comes close in terms of such captivating and enchanted moments on film is 'The Master, 2012' by P. T. Anderson. Stoker is an Americanized version of the Chan-wook anthology. A rigorous watch will show you all the signatures of the director, complete to the past scenes from earlier films. He treats you with long complicated, gliding and intricate shots of conversations that have to be closely watched(read: immersed)to be followed. From the Ray Bans to the ice- cream, everything has a meaning. The script is simple yet curvy and the end predictable but extremely well executed. This is not home territory,(although Scott Free Productions had given Chan-wook complete creative control) and this isn't Korea either. It does not matter because the film has been sculpted with such masterful intricacy that every scene takes you in its arms and lets you watch it unravel the rest of the poetry with wonderment. It is a beautiful film and yet another success for Chan-wook, whose 'Old Boy, 2003' and 'Thirst, 2009' have made 'the films' better, bolder, more poetic, tragic, riveting and satisfying. From non-linear, Kubrickesque lengthy camera-runs to daunting reflections in mirrors and shades, Stoker will leave you wanting more; not of the same but more from the director, who seems heavily influenced by Sophocles, specially his play 'Oedipus the King'. Stoker is a delightfully twisted film to watch right after you've come to notice the credit roll, because during the film it hypnotizes and the roll is a finger snap.",Stoker
219,redskyfilming,Style Over Substance,1,6 June 2013,"Having watched the terrible decline in many areas of movie making over the past 20 years, i think 'Stoker' is a clear example of a movie that is all style and little else. Chan-Wook Park seems to be idolized by the chosen few who seem to think his movies are pure art. Quite where this comes from i have no idea. Take the 'Stoker' storyline; Daddy dies, Uncle appears from his travels, Mummy falls in love with Uncle, Uncle has a crazed sexual longing for his niece, cue over the top killings. Add to all of this a collage of 'so called' cool scenes including the bursting of a foot blister in extreme close up, the spreading of tennis balls on a court, nicely placed boxes of shoes on a bed, an egg being rolled around a table with a weird crunching sound,the daughter dressed in strange 'Meeks Cutoff' movie leftovers,the Uncle who drives a sports car alongside a school bus of screaming girls, the horrendous eating sounds of the daughter at each meal time (maybe something to do with her super hearing) and on and on. A total mess of footage that we are meant to see as 'total Art-house'. Matthew Goode must have laughed his way through this garbage thinking of the paycheck. Nicole Kidman simply did what she has done in many of her previous movies by acting strange. Last but not least, the very over rated Mia Wasikowska who simply plays the oddball and is better known for her unpronounceable name and whiter than white skin. This movie is typical of today's output by directors making a name for themselves with sub standard crap pretending it is art.I have not been so bored since i watched the aforementioned 'Meeks Cutoff'. Straight in with a bullet as one of the worst movies of this decade.",Stoker

There was not a lot going on, but apparently a lot was going on inside the head of the protagonist, who is a young confused 18-year old girl. It seems as though she and her uncle are somehow mentally connected, but there is really no way to know for sure. I find it strange how the uncle thrives on sex in order to get what he wants, however at the same time he is not fund of being physically touched. The movie does make you think, and I like that aspect about it. I've been waiting for a good thriller or ""psychological-horror"", as some may call it, for a long time, and this half- delivers. It's a good watch, but I would definitely not pay to see it, I would watch it free online. The movie did however remind me of the TV-Shows Hannibal, Dexter and Desperate Housewives, as I feel that some of the fundamental aspects to this movie was derived from the three TV-Shows.",Stoker

Unlike parks other successes such as oldboy and thirst stoker was on the tamer side however it did not disappoint. it proved to be more intellectually developed and had style. after minuets of watching i found myself glued to the movie and drawn into the mystery.Stoker is a well developed intellectual physiological thriller, by far the best i have seen not only is the cinematography outstanding the story line and character development is mastered excellently down to the fine details. Park delivers ever scene perfectly with ever shot, emotion,music. He manages to deliver an sharp clean performance and adds a better scene of reality by using little music and focusing on acting and atmosphere to deliver emotion and the jist to the audience of how the characters feel and how they are meant to feel in that situation and it works fantastically. This masterpiece is not only a successful movie shot directed perfectly but is an art of which i cannot fault. This film is a rare find and is truly beautiful and hypnotic because it dives deep into the characters minds and shows exactly how they are thinking but yet still keeps hidden the darkest secrets and adds a dream like feel to this strange reality which yet feels so real yet so far from normality. This is by far the best and most unique physiological thriller and strongly recommend this unique and beautiful form of art.",Stoker

The acting is also superb. Mia Wasikawska is the most talented young actress out there and this is the best role for her to show what she's capable of. It is intriguing, stylistic, and sexy. And I love that it's also a coming-of-age story, but I don't want to go into more detail with that because of the spoiler potential. And it's also a mystery too. Where does she get the key?

223,jbmaverick,A Potentially Great Movie Totally Ruined by a Stupid Ending,2,31 January 2021,"This movie had me totally captivated up until the last 15-20 minutes...when it, unfortunately, turned stone cold stupid. If you make the mistake of thinking about it for, oh, 10 seconds, the ending makes no sense whatsoever - it's just BEYOND stupid and utterly unbelievable. (A) It's not in any way believable that the main character turned out to be the way she was in the end. Let's keep in mind, they hammered home the fact that she was a ""daddy's girl"". (A) IF that IS the way she was (the way she acted in the end), then it makes no sense that she did what she did in the end in relation to Charlie. The only thing that would have been logically consistent with that would have been her running off with him (which is the only thing that could have made the ending any MORE stupid than it is).
Great movie up until that utterly idiotic ending, but the ending is SO bad that I felt like I'd just wasted an hour and a half of my life.
P.S. Nicole Kidman's character, although very well acted, also made no sense at all. Again, just THINK for 10 seconds - her late husband was portrayed as essentially a good guy and good father - now, if they'd hinted that HE was evil somehow, okay, I might have bought her behavior - but they DIDN'T do that, and so HER behavior is - like the ending of the movie - totally NOT believable, does not make sense in any way.
FINALLY - spoiler alert - even granting the writer/director every benefit of the doubt, there's no way in hell that you can explain away the main character - shortly after they first move in (in other words, long before she could have been charmed and seduced by Charlie) - finding a BODY in the freezer and just walking back upstairs and going on with life - as opposed to, say, screaming, or calling the police, or running out of the house, terrified...

The content is so over the top and far fetched that by the end of it you feel like throwing up. PROs: The visualisation of the scenes is just brilliant. The viewer can seek the painstaking efforts taken to get the shots and expression right. The acting is good and all the actors do a fine job. CONs: The script is so far fetched and you just cannot empathize with any of the characters. The behaviour of Mathew Goode's character Charlie is just too much to believe as suddenly he is suave and the next like a little kid.

The characters in these movies had depth for an emotional connection. The screenplay was masterfully crafted and the cinematography was flawless too.However, I have mixed feelings for Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. Considering the director's previous films, I went for Stoker expecting something new,deep and gripping. But, the movie was beyond disappointing. It was borderline awful. While the shots and frames are beautiful in Stoker, the movie on the whole and characters lack soul. It appears that the director wanted to make something very abstract without delving into much depth. The characters open mysteriously which makes you wonder about who they are, but very soon they all become too cartoonish. The story of Stoker is wafer-thin and the director makes no bones about it. The director desperately tries to impress with his serene shots, refreshing soundtrack and shock-value but he remains desperate till the very end. The movie fails on both arty and entertainment values. There are way too many loopholes as well and the by time the movie credits roll, you're thankful that it's over. Make no mistake, this is nowhere near the director's best. The most disappointing aspect of it all is not the movie, it's that a great director gets a chance in Hollywood to showcase his talents and he fluffs it big time.",Stoker

Matthew Goode is almost getting away with murder and everything, you can almost understand why this is happening, that good he is in portraying a fascinating criminal man-child. Mia's interpretation is amazing in this becoming of age drama, really, with all of the complexity of the still scenes , almost unbearable to watch some times. Nicole is the best in balancing this wired love and hate triangle and I adore her scenes with Mia. The DP is a master of his profession for sure...I have never seen so much care for details in the frame and also the angles of filming are quite interesting (see the scene when uncle Charlie is moving slowly between what you realize it is a mirror and the hallway, beautifully shot and so well played by Matthew.

230,AndyMic,"Dark, Mysterious & A Freakishly Hot Mystery-Piece: Loved it!",9,11 February 2014,"This is Chan-wook Park's first American film and I sure hope it will not be his last. Like the most of his films it is a bit weird and sometimes violent. Have in mind though that the violence, disturbness etc, is Nothing compared to some of his earlier works.The script, written by Wentworth Miller (Prison Brake) is not flawless, but really really good.At the moment I am breath taken by the acting of the whole ensemble.Kidman delivers as always, Mia Wasikowska is as good if not better, I did not realize that I had already seen like five of her films until I checked her out on IMDb, hats off for this young lady, I am totally starstruck/in love/blown away, what a fantastic actress! And last but Definitely not least Matthew Goode, I didn't think he could deliver what he does in this type of film, I was wrong, I have always considered him a good actor but had only seen him in geek-like roles.If you the viewer are sensitive; this almost masterpiece might be disturbing for you to watch, I'm not gonna spoil why...But for all you mystery/thriller lovers out there it's a must see.The Only reason I did not give this film a ten star rating was because in my mind it was to short, I would have liked to see more/deeper character development, most of all between the cast as a whole. I seriously got a bit angry when I realized it was only ten minutes left, I didn't want it to end!!!I am trying to be as serious as I can (this is my 2nd review). Some of you might call this what I'm about to write unserious or freaky, but this film actually turned me on. Really turned me on. Watch it with your man/woman/girl/boy. You will Not be disappointed. There lives an evil demon in each of us, and sometimes we have to let them out to play.. Just like Park and the cast does so distinguished in STOKER!See it! And BTW; the Photo is also stunning.

231,josh-monie,Waste of my money,2,3 March 2013,"If you enjoy being distracted by unnecessarily complex cinematography and bored to death by the flat dialogue, go and see this film.If you are, however, a fan of films that actually somewhat entertain you, do NOT see this film. I am an avid film fan and filmmaker myself and am normally very open to different and ""quirky"" styles of filmmaking.STOKER, however, was something I wasn't willing to accept. After the first 40 minutes, all that appears to have happened was the cinematographer's 11th orgasm and a girl had played piano. The pacing was appalling, the script was unentertaining. I understand the need for simple, effective dialogue but this took it to another level. The lead named India was undeniably creepy yet was unable to provide any real momentum. The mother was quite frankly annoying to watch for any more than 10 seconds and Uncle Charlie just seemed to float around, occasionally uttering blindly obvious or stupidly confusing anecdotes, depending on the scene.Whilst a small number of scenes actually brought some tension to the story through the use of clever parallel editing, the remainder was unfortunately spoiled by the DP's obsession with shots that craned and tracked and racked focus at every possible opportunity - they say good cinematography should blend seamlessly with the story. This did the total opposite.",Stoker
232,Mubz,Stylish. Chilling. Unmissable.,9,29 November 2013,"After the death of her husband, unstable widow Evie Stoker (Kidman) invites his estranged brother, Charles (Goode), to stay. A complete mystery to daughter India (Wasikowska), what begins as an instant loathing of Charles, turns into a much deeper and darker relationship. Intent on gaining the approval of India, the paths of Charles and India intertwine leading to very grave consequences.From Chan-wook Park, mastermind of Oldboy and the acclaimed Vengeance trilogy, his first all English production is a superb one. In his relatively short career, Chan-wook has created a legacy for himself. True, legacy is a strong word, however we have come to expect a certain kind of film with him, films founded on premises of brutality that have lasting effects post-watch. These expectations are never uniformly presented and it is here that Park is assuredly deserved of auteurship. Stoker is no different, and from the very opening shot we are thrust into a world of mystery and strangeness, void of all emotion yet full of intensity. There is a distinct numbness to the film and the entire world created within it, one that is both disturbing but equally engaging. You may watch through squinted eyes or through your fingers, but watching you will remain.There is clear purpose to this film, great precision with every aspect. So precise that the film cannot be imagined without a single one. Every frame, every flash of colour, every look of horror and intrigue has meaning. The care that has been taken in making this film is obvious, but the real force of what is on screen comes from what that same care has been taken to create. Stoker is nothing short of a horror. Not a gory, blood-fuelled adrenaline rush, but a horror that silently creeps under your skin and is, at times, truly uncomfortable. The script, a sapling born from the meadows of Wentworth Miller's mind, is highly effective and works as an anchor for the dark mood created by Chan-wook's direction. Few words are wasted and real expression is left to the looks offered between characters; the crazy eyes, the morbid stares, they are the greater purveyors of evil and conundrum.But with a film as intricate as this, great responsibility rests on the cast, and they do not disappoint. Each adds something extra to the mix- be it the broody, unflinching persona of India, the charming, intoxicating nature of uncle Charles, or the volatility of Evie. With every interaction the plot thickens, forcing us deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. The film takes place almost entirely within the huge manor house of the Stokers, and with the manor house full of secrets all too familiar to the horror genre, it is testament to the successes of Chan-wook and the ensemble cast that Stoker feels fresh.Verdict: Incestuous, frightening and brilliantly engaging, Chan-wook Park has created nothing short of a masterpiece. A wonderful example of the scope and effectiveness that remains within the horror genre, given a mind as remarkable as Chan-wook Park's.",Stoker
233,morganstrk,Blood ties explored in a poignant and disturbing manner; striking; beautiful,8,6 February 2013,"I was privileged enough to view this film at the annual Sundance Film Festival and I must say it was well worth the time and wait. The cast itself includes some incredibly talented and experienced names, yet it is India (Wasikowska) and her raptor-like awareness, that truly sets the tone for the film when drawing upon the mystery and oddity of supporting characters who sink deeper into their roles like fangs in flesh as the film clicks along. The script itself could be rewritten with more depth and attention to the emotional wealth and strange sway of the characters, for all of them are skilled enough to operate powerfully under the shroud of mystery director Park Chan-Wook erects so flawlessly, yet the film could be much improved in tragic and horrifying value through a more tailored script. Editing must also be noted, for Chan-Wook's is very engaging in that it utilizes the temporal frequency to link certain events, building upon India's character and the internal struggles of those who surround her, as well as the realization of her uncanny ability to cope with the revelations that come about and fit so frighteningly together. The audience comes to realize that some mysteries are exclusive only to those who are bound to travel the same blood trail that links generations in infinite conclusion and everlasting despair and a terrible longing and love can be as exclusive in it's own forbidden and lonely way. The soundtrack is pleasantly surprising and fitting, with a piece from Clint Mansell (Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream) and the debut of Emily Wells's ""Becomes the Color"", which serves to chart India's multifaceted transformation. I strongly recommend this film and highly praise actors Mia Wasikowska, Nicole Kidman, Matthew Goode, and Dermot Mulroney, who all contribute to the initial and lasting allure.",Stoker

However, if you are a performance actor, this is a must see. There are many precious moments with almost no speaking lines where the actors give you goose bumps.

I sat down to watch the film expecting it to be bad and it was not. I loved it. The acting the was spot on, the characters flawless in their representation. The plot was extremely interesting. The movie as a whole was captivating. The only thing I hated about it is that it was over. It's not an action-packed, explode in your face kind of film.

I was a bit surprised that he chose Stoker as his debut in the states because the storyline is very simple. it has a few twists and turns and keeps you on the edge but just because it's not as dense as his Korean work does not mean it disappoints.

The main character, a just-turned-18 year old, should have been positioned as a 'coming of age' kind of story. But she was (and is) a mystery. I was always trying to guess what she is like - even after the ending with its twists and turns, I still have no idea.And then there's the disturbing parts which the only way I can reconcile it is to think that it is her 'awakening'. But I can't believe there are people who actually think this is 'art'. And very disappointed in such a high rating of almost 7 - do people really think this stuff is worthwhile to watch?

242,Chelsea-Guy,Simply Elegant and Evil,8,8 March 2013,"Stoker is done in typical Art-house style; Simple, Spare, Elegant and Diabolically Evil. Suspenseful throughout and never fully revealing it's purpose or plot. All the participants are moving casually to an uncertain conclusion, perhaps a fatal one. This could be said of most films but here it's used with skill to set a mood of a cool dance with the devil. Nicole Kiddman's portrayal of the disturbed unhinged widow completely without grief is tragic and lost. Her need for attention has led her into a deadly flirtation and has further alienated her daughter India, played in dour style by Mia Wasikowska. Their relationship and involvement seems disturbingly precarious and painful, this is not unusual for teenage girls and their Mothers, but here it is exceedingly so. A dangerous and charming Matthew Goode seems to go with the flow and is undeterred in his purpose. With his sexual advances and musical skill he pushes an already disturbed household far beyond the edge. This is a very special coming of age film, one with it's own unique flavor. A very dark macabre tale that has twists and turns that are both horrific and droll. Some of the cinematography is beautiful and the music is and excellent player in the drama. Simple but never dull !",Stoker

244,lianaki-imdb,Intriguing and disturbing,8,31 August 2013,"Without the appropriate cinematic skills, this film could have sunk completely, but thanks to Chan-wook Park being a master of psychological thriller, it came to be a nice work of art. A great manipulator of the audience's emotions, he meticulously constructs the movie in such a way to get you exactly where he wants you throughout it. He might be a little bold, but he knows how to keep the balance.""Stoker"" obliges you to stay fully conscious all the time to keep up with the symbolisms and invites you to use your imagination. The director wants a participating audience, is ambiguous on purpose, loves to make us wonder and speculate just as much as he loves leaving us room for interpretation when the film ends. Deliberate loose ends and cut scenes, designed to confuse the viewer and cause uncertainty.Much like with his all-time classic, puzzling masterpiece ""Oldboy"", Park wants to disturb you. An exciting, twisted story, very powerful scenes, even scenes that many people won't be able to tolerate. A compelling story about dark nature and sickness, about liberating yourself and becoming aware of your desires. Violence is portrayed with scenes focused on beauty, and sexuality is portrayed dark and repressed. I liked the script by Wentworth Miller (although I don't think the script gets full credit for the suspense created here), and I found Mia Wasikowska's performance superb.This film is dark and might make you feel disgusted or uncomfortable. But for me, the beauty of the scenes, the emotions it provokes and how it climaxes, made me think of it as a piece of music.",Stoker

An easy pace that allows you to enjoy the sets, locations, even the wardrobe works well and is, in some parts significant.Here we have a family that is unsure of the responsibility of the individual roles that would be expected of them and seem somewhat lost in there wonderful, carefree surroundings until the handsome Knave turns up, and applies the mustard to the delicate picnic blanket.

From the cast are excellent interpretations of Mia Wasikowska, a young actress with a career in downhill, and Matthew Goode, disturbing and fascinating at the same time, just as script requires. Nicole Kidman slightly subdued, especially for the role a little 'stereotypical widow's pathetic (although a ruling last monologue really intense and well acted on offspring). The content covered are by no means trivial and obvious: In fact the film in a nutshell explains how the violence and wickedness are inherent within each of us and although you do not notice skin can always resurface. Overall it is a great thriller, deliberately disturbing for some pictures, and traits characteristic of the genre recognizable tension, twists, cruelty and suitable music are present in a consistent manner.

It feels as though the actors were not given enough time to process the characters they were supposed to be playing. Even the performance of Mia Wasikowska, who I admire as an actress, was lacking.They have not changed the script very much but I feel as though the tone and setting have been changed - and not for the better. The car scene (where Richard Stoker informs Charles that he has to love him a little less now) which is greatly influenced by Miller's own experience, was completely messed up. Both Mathew Goode and Dermot Mulroney fail (miserably) to capture the intensity of guilt, frustration, anger, humiliation, hurt and anguish that I was hoping to see.It looks to me like the entire movie was shot hurriedly. It feels like the characters are merely reciting their lines - there is no emotion behind those dialogue deliveries. Since the cast has given amazing performances in the past, I can only deduce that they chose the wrong director.All in all, I would suggest that you read the original screenplay as written by Wentworth Miller rather than watch the movie.

It's a semi-slow pace film but you can't help but think that the story is developing a bit too fast. It also appears that Kidman didn't have that much space to show what she can truly do with a character.
Also, watching Wasikowska and her character's constant pouting with the 'I am an enigma' attitude, you can't help but draw a parallel between her and Wednesday Adams. In this film, she's Wednesday Adams from Stepford, focused only on being plain irritating, dressed in full color of course.

256,ilikeboringthings,Past-Present Park Chan Wook,6,4 July 2013,"This is the least of Park Chan Wook I have seen of himself in his own film. He kept his promise of keeping us entertained through his captivating visuals but something about the story was just so unexciting and predictable. Aside form Park's style, one of the elements that I like in his films is his ability to create a wonderfully planned story planted with many surprises that really will play with the expectations of his audience. It was Prison Break star Wentworth Miller who wrote the script for Stoker and I think he did pretty well with this suspense psychological film. I've been a fan of Park Chan Wook for quite some time now and I just felt that story-wise, there is only little of Park Chan Wook in this film. The most disappointing part (not that I hated it, it just didn't meet my expectations) of the film is its plot. Although strong and perfectly written in accordance to the scenes to match certain symbolisms and themes (there's the battle of good and evil, isolation and repression etc), I sort of figured out that uncle Charlie was the suspect here in the first 20mins of the film (I'm sure a lot of people thought the same way too). Uncle Charlie's character was well developed (guests at the event didn't know who he was and he was always framed to look like somethings wrong with him) or probably too developed that even at the start of the film, we already knew what was going to happen. One noticeable element of this film is that this has less action (strongly evident in Park's Vengeance Trilogy) and more poetry compared to Park's past works. What's great about him is that no matter if his films are action-based or now, leaning on a poetic approach, he always makes good films. I have to applaud the precision of this film's pace and ability to not waste a single frame. The use of shallow depth of field and slowmo was so perfectly used in this film. I'm sure a lot of people will regard this film as one with beautiful cinematography. I couldn't expect more from the actors because each of them portrayed their characters so well (It's mostly face acting wherein Nicole and Mia did a great job) Nonetheless, it was a good film. I was thoroughly entertained and I assure you that you will be drawn by the film's cinematography. The film also shows a great balance of cinematic elements (production design, sound and cinematography) that would be great if you're studying film production or making a scene analysis.",Stoker
257,Wendy1967,"Luris style can't cover meagre, far-fetched story.",2,9 March 2013,"With its evocative title and quirky Gothic horror tone, the first English-language film from Korean Park Chan-wook reads like an obvious companion piece to the director's 2009 vampire parable Thirst.The only monsters here, however, are unmistakably and unambiguously human. And yet despite this, Stoker's blood runs cold. The unfortunate consequence of an undeniably beautiful but weirdly hollow portrait of eroding family values.After the untimely death of her father Richard (Dermot Mulroney), just-18 Wednesday Addams clone India Stoker (Mia Wasikowska) is saddled with a numbing sense of abandonment. Not only has she lost her dearest pop but her best friend, the one person who truly understood her.India's grief-stricken mother Evie (Nicole Kidman) clearly isn't cut out for single-parenthood – her maternal inadequacy summed up in the line, ""Personally speaking, I can't wait to watch life tear you apart."" So it's to both women's relief when long-lost Uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode) shows up out of the blue offering solace.So far so Shadow Of A Doubt. Regrettably, however, that's where the comparisons with Hitchcock's superlative psychological thriller end.Before Charlie takes up temporary residence at the leafy family estate, from the moment India first notices him staring intently at her through the trees at his brother's funeral, we sense there's a hidden agenda to his sudden arrival. His intentions are signposted so early on, in fact, that we're braced for the mask to slip before he's even formally introduced as the urbane, enigmatic branch of the Stoker family tree.Genre hounds will lap up the literary references, macabre symbolism and occasional spatter of claret, not to mention the rich cinematography provided by regular Chanwook collaborator Chung Chung-hoon.But no amount of style can compensate the terminal lack of sense in Prison Break actor Wentworth Miller's debut script. The whole thing plays out like a Stephenie Meyer penned episode of Midsomer Murders in which each character's dramatic arc is offset by irrational actions and illogical judgements.The film's parting sin: a long reveal-all flashback that dampens any lingering glimmer of intrigue and leaves very little to savour on repeat viewings.Littlewhitelies.",Stoker
258,quektis,"Not his best, but very good",9,13 October 2015,"You could be forgiven for feeling a little uneasy about the prospects Chan-wook's transition from an industry that has birthed some of the most refreshingly unique cinematic gems of the last few decades, to a market oversaturated with insipid blockbusters. Coming from a country that allows total creative freedom to its directors, my first question was how will he fair working with studios that tend to pull the rains on creativity, when it does not suit their pecuniary vision? Well, fear not, Chan-wook's touch is well and truly alive in Stoker.Written by the Prison Break director, Wentworth Miller, the script is reminiscent of Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt. On her 18th birthday, India (Mia Wasikowska) has her life turned upside down after her father (Dermot Mulroney) dies in a car accident. In comes her enigmatic and excessively creepy uncle Charlie (Matthew Goode). Her unknown father's brother has travelled the world his entire life, and has come to stay with them indefinitely to support India and her mother (Nicole Kidman) through this difficult time. India's father was the only person she had ever felt close to. As a result, having been depraved of any emotional connection with her mother and not fitting in with the outside world, she has become an introverted recluse. She is understandably wary of her strange uncle who is trying hard to become intimate with her, whilst insidiously taking her father's place within the family. The setting leads us to feel sorry for India, who is portrayed as a rebellious outsider that has become the victim of her surroundings, though eventually her behaviour takes a turn in the most unexpected ways. India finds herself at an expedited crossroad of life: she must make the transition from the innocence of childhood to becoming a responsible adult. Will she decide to embrace the darkness within her heart or to replace it with positive influences? The two positive influences in her life are her household's caretaker, Mrs. McGarrick (Phyllis Somerville), and her great aunt Gwendolyn (Jacki Weaver). Eventually, both, Mrs. McGarrick and Gwendolyn, disappear from her life altogether, and India gives into her nefarious uncle's influence. From the outset it is evident that India and her mother lack any kind of emotional connection and that they are alienated from one-another. Her mother's egocentrism prevents her from understanding her daughter; she sees herself as the victim of her daughter's neglect, not realising that her daughter is in fact the victim of her own neglect. The tension between both characters escalates, until the mother eventually shows her cracks, and denigrates her daughter through a heinous monologue, that brilliantly epitomises her egomania: ""personally speaking I can't wait to watch life tear you apart India who are you? You were supposed to love me weren't you?"" The monologue is the final nail in the coffin, shattering any hope of India ever reconciling with her mother.Although the mother comes across as see-through, India and her uncle are anything but. You will spend most of the film picking your brain, trying to put your thumb on who they are, what they are thinking, and what their intentions are. These confounding thoughts are not only brought on by the characters' withdrawn inclinations, but also through their incredibly weird behaviour, that often leaves us stupefied and confused about their motives. Without trying to give away too much of the plot, these people have some serious issues.There are few characters in this movie and everything happens predominantly within the confined environment of their family estate, drawing the focus on trying to make sense of India and her family in a deep and thoughtful way. Although the film is fairly short (just over 1.5 hours), nothing feels rushed; the movie takes its time to breathe life and tension into every scene. Every camera angle, object, camera movement, gesture and sound is meticulously calculated. There is not a single frame that seems out of place or in need of improvement. Small details in sound, such as cutlery scraping a plate and entering the mouth, a wild animal screeching in the distance or India's steps synchronised to the sound of a metronome add greatly to the atmosphere. The film holds great artistic merit, though this is something I automatically expect from Chan-wook Park given his extensive C.V..This is a film that stays with you long after you have seen it, and makes you think about its characters and events on a much deeper level than most films come close to. After the film had ended, I found myself desperately looking for some kind of message to hold on to. It left me feeling so perplexed that I craved understanding of who these characters are, and why they are the way they are. It's a movie that makes you invest time and thought into its characters, with the thought that in the end you will be rewarded with understanding. Instead, the more you watch, the less you understand or relate to them. Every one of my apperceptions towards its characters was thrown back in my face until I had to admit that I knew nothing about them. This is not a fault but rather one of the movies strengths; it plays on your mind without ever giving it the fulfilment it requires.This is a great little movie with solid acting across the board. It is a story steeped in family secrets, ominosity, creepy characters and sexual tension. The worst thing I could say about it is that it is one of my least favourite Chan-wook Park movies, which is misleading as I absolutely love all of them. This movie does not try to be his best work, neither does it need to. It is humble in its execution and perfect in its own way.",Stoker
259,rugile-ka,"Nice cinematography, but storyline disappointed",6,7 June 2013,"I loved cinematography and was intrigued by the story at the beginning of the film. Actors were perfect for those characters, but sometimes I felt that acting was overdone and had moments when I thought to myself 'who would talk like that in reality? So many pauses and they are just staring at each other.' However, when crazy things started happening and I realised it's going to be one of the typical endings, I simply lost my interest. I guess it's a matter of personal taste, but I thought this was just too much and the ending was a little bit shallow. I still give it 6 since it kept me interested, intrigued and still excited for about two thirds of the film.",Stoker

261,damianlan,Good... could have been excellent.,7,8 February 2014,"This movie remind it me when i was a little boy, watching it with no expectations at all and just going along with it. it was just so good. the art direction makes the most part of it, every scene has it's own element of charm, it really captures what i feel is the core of the main character, India. Other thing that i loved about it was the use of sound, the cracked egg, hair being brushed,even silent steps are magnified, very minimal but always ""in your face"" kind of wayI wish the screenplay would've given more importance to the other characters as well to make the film a bit more believable, somewhere in the middle i felt like they were throwing me so many elements without logical explanations and, to be honest, they don't even deliver that to the end. For me, Kidman's character was poorly used, it could have made the whole story, instead they come up with this mysterious, almost fantasy character that makes an environment of old fashioned thriller.But like i said before, the way it's filmed and the art direction made me enjoy it so much that the screenplay wasn't so much of a problem at the end, but it could've been so much more, something memorable.",Stoker
262,Gostros,A breath of fresh air!,8,29 June 2013,"This movie is a breath of fresh air! It's very well made and it will make people uncomfortable because it's not your average Sunday night flick. The movie, i believe, pushes the idea that psychopathic killers can be clean cut well educated people and that evil can take so many forms. I don't want to spoil anything so i will just say this : The young India and her charming uncle Charlie share something , a dark and twisted characteristic, something beyond their control and they can't do anything but accept it. This is expressed in the beginning when India says in her monologue "" Just as a flower does not choose its color, we are not responsible for what we have come to be"" . Overall a decent movie, not a great one but hey, I'm happy that movies like this are still made, movies that make you think and put a little pressure on you. The cast did a good job, Nicole Kidman brilliant as always, you just can't go wrong with her and Mia Wasikowska was perfect for this role.",Stoker
263,dcfieldview-254-189249,Not at all what I was expecting,8,12 December 2013,"I just finished watching Stoker and I rarely feel compelled to write a review. This film is WAY underrated. It is NOT a supernatural/horror flick and has absolutely no obvious relationship to the literary name ""Stoker"".From the opening, it has a dark feel, without giving the sense that it's going to be another Nicole Kidman in a creepy old house movie (think ""The Others""). It was perfectly cast and extremely well acted. Kidman plays an ice-queen, dis-likable mother perfectly, Mia Wasikowska plays a young woman amazingly reminiscent of Wednesday Addams without any sense of camp (and believe me, none is intended). But Matthew Goode's portrayal of Uncle Charlie is absolutely charming and chilling - all I could think of was Anthony Perkins in Psycho. He is ultra-calm, innocent-looking straight on, but always just a little creepy when viewed out of the corner of a character's eye. The suspense with his persona builds all the way through,even though his purpose is made clear pretty early on, right to the unexpected end of the film.The movie also boasts an excellent soundtrack.I think the film suffered from it's name - people were expecting something else and those who were disappointed panned it. If you like suspenseful, tight film noir, you will not be wasting your time watching this movie.",Stoker
264,stephan-hofbauer,"no suspense, predictable outcome",1,7 October 2013,"Sorry for the wasted time. No idea where the good ratings come from. Repeatedly we see women taking a shower but unlike in ""Psycho"" they are just taking a shower - o.k., the girl masturbates, obviously turned on by the killings (or started the killing aftewards?). Its not worth talking about so I will not go into detail. Just another bad movie. To make it 10 lines (that's the minimum length, I've just been told): Is there or is the not a head in the freezer? How does the boy get on top of the girl (rape!) after he's been tied up by the uncle and kicked by the niece - did they just arrange it to make the neck-breaking more spectacular? So, that will be 10 lines if I manage to finish this one - I refuse to add anything more about the film.",Stoker

I thought, it will be some light, 1 afternoon movie, with no-name actors, creepy noises, and nothing special. And i was so wrong. Most of time i watch the films beside playing, or something else, but this piece of art chained my eyes to the monitor, and i had to see it fullscreen:) Its not really scary, i would use better creepy. The scenes are beautiful, the story is simple but dynamic, but the tone is first of all on the characters. And the cast was perfect. And The outcome is one of the most beautiful scary-creepy film, i've ever seen. I could compare the feeling with ""El laberinto del fauno"" scored by Guillermo del Torro.",Stoker
266,Ariae,Intriguing and unexpected,8,22 April 2016,"Stoker never lets you get too close, it always manages to stay one step ahead of you so that you're always left wondering ""what's going to happen next?"" This is the beauty of mystery type movies when they are made just the right way, so that the viewer has to think for himself and form his own understanding of what is happening.. and going to happen. But also why it's happening.Mia Wasikowska plays the Intriguing and mysterious character flawlessly.

When you keep watching you realize all the characters have and intriguing dark side. The movie is a roller-coaster, has a lot of intelligent twists which are perfectly shown by Chan-wook Park shots. The characters are all disturbing and confusing. You may get to like them but somehow you can't relate to them. In one scene you see India as a sad and lonely girl and on the next you see her as rude and aggressive. That is what makes this movie more interesting. The movie is a piece of art thanks to Park's style and the music that accompanies it. The slow pace makes it more gripping and give to time to think about what's happening. The end is awesome. This film is completely worth watching and personally, I loved it.",Stoker
268,fabiferro,Good and Different,8,24 September 2014,"Crazy and tense film. The director have been working in a different way to show his ideas in every movie he makes. in Soteker, at first, you think it's a common movie with the girl trying to save his family and everything goes wrong and impossible and dumb things happening etc. But as the history evolves, you find that nobody is a saint and hidden trues start to show up. The scenes are filmed in a tense way with the music. Expect the unexpected at least until the beginning of second half. I think the IMDb ranking is kind of unfair as I saw lots of other films with a better score with weak history and more of the same happenings. I like to watch many kinds of genres blockbusters, cults, oldies and the crazy ones. I liked this movie.",Stoker

Or perhaps it was not HER son, but a previous wife? None of this is explained, even in the imagery-opulent manner in which other mysteries are 'explained'. Whichever may be the case, either explanation rings hollow... at any rate, that made it unbelievable for me in the long run. Too bad, because otherwise I think it would have been a winner.",Stoker
270,antiwebspams-mail,A masterpiece,10,11 March 2013,"Another masterpiece by Park, who playfully, coldly and ruthlessly explores the darkness of the human psyche.The movie is not only as good as the trailer, but hugely better and even more mysterious and captivating. It simply blows your mind away. Fortunately, I ignored the negative Anglophobe reviews and watched it. It's the most complete artistic work by Chan-wook Park in his career so far, an ingenious masterpiece, with the only minor complaint being the lack of the explicit violence he depicts in his Korean movies; this is not his fault though, but the request of the American companies involved, and still he manages to make us shiver with the cruelty of the violent scenes depicted and insinuated.To fully appreciate this movie, you must have watched Old Boy and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance, and in general to be a fan of Korean and Japanese cinema. The script is excellent, violent, unpredicted, the plot mysterious and sinister, and not for those who love the silliness of American spoon-fed cinema. If you don't like or understand international cinema, then don't bother. This movie and Matthew Goode's performance are Oscar material, if Oscars were not political travesties.I have never watched such a cinematic masterpiece before. Highly stylised, every move, every word, the posture of the actors, every tiny detail has a meaning. The mansion filmed on location has an ominous air of decadence. The plot is clearly outlined: India is a strange girl, with something dark and off about her. Her mother is a depressed rich stay-at-home housewife, and we understand that her marriage has become a chore. When India's father has a mysterious car accident, uncle Charlie, an unbelievably handsome man, suddenly appears. And bad things start happening. Who, what and why? The movie builds up the plot and the suspension like a dance or the notes of a symphony! This is something I have felt with other movies by Park, and they are the only movies I watch again and again to fully take in and appreciate every detail, and the beautiful music throughout. Little by little, every nod, word, step, bring us to the climax, to the end, the answer to the questions and the harsh reality. There are no easy supernatural explanations here. Only the malevolence of the human heart.",Stoker
271,peter-lynes,A Delicious Feast,8,17 August 2013,"My first review, so here goes: It's a dark and intense tale which challenges the viewer. I'm not going to elaborate on the plot, but Wentworth Miller deserves a mention as he's proved that he is a most capable writer & passion driven producer. This is my first viewing of Chan-Wook Park directed film, his first English language offering & hopefully not his last.To me this film has a strong David Lynch feel as in Blue Velvet & very strong atmospheres created by meticulous design and attention to every detail. The lead cast; Nicole Kidman, Matthew Goode & Mia Wasikowska are brilliant, with the later two being particularly well paired. The supporting roles are also solid and believable. The plot pace is slow and often understated but well measured. It runs at precisely the right speed to take in the multiple levels of detail, it's a four course meal with all the trimmings. You would have to be a fool to rush that. The sumptuous detail in all aspects of the production are a feast, the atmospheres and particularly the interior design are beautiful. I'm not normally big on interior design, but here it's almost tangible with an outstanding selection of textures, patterns & colours playing an integral part of the film. The furniture, textiles and even the table lamps are to die for and all fit in perfectly. In the same way, the house is ubber perfect, albeit except little odd touches like where the old light switches have been painted over, which is somewhat at odds with this perfection. There is also the use of exterior macro filming that somehow adds a nice touch.I have't used the word surreal, but surreal it is, it keeps you engaged & thinking, it demands your full attention, which will richly reward you. Watch out for the hair brushing scene, you should be amazed at the skill of the editing at the end of scene.The sound design and mix are exemplary & has obviously had a great level of care given to it. It too reveals a great deal & adds to the atmosphere but is never over the top.The music score is pure class & with a cool memorable track from Nancy Sinatra & Lee Hazlewood. A quality piano track instantly identified itself as Philip Glass, what more could you ask for?This is not a pop-corn movie, you really need to get your teeth into it. I won't use the clichéd line about it becoming a cult, but will predict that with some passing time, it will be appreciated and hold up well as the years pass.I think it's a great movie and look forward to watching it again soon, although it's not going to be to everyone's liking. DON'T MISS IT",Stoker
272,leanneenzsol,Stoker (2013),10,6 January 2014,"Stoker. An imaginative narrative paired with an artistic cinematic view, would be the perfect description of this dark coming of age feature. Although the narrative took almost an hour to begin to coming out, I found the tension building journey nail biting. I have never seen any off Parks work before I already consider him and artist. Every shot was beautifully well planned, and every movement inviting. I found the end shots of India and they officers spayed blood very metaphorical or India's turn to the dark side. Parks repeated in interview about the narrative being a journey of bad blood, I have never agreed to the ridicules idea, that personality traits are inherited from the blood lines. However the traits that both India and her Uncles possess have allowed me to believe in this statement. It's not just the artistically brilliant shots that make this film, the trios under played performance added sense of mystery and poise to the film. Especially Matthew Goode's Performance of uncle Charley who's every movement had me on edge. Nicole, who played India's mother in a pathetic manor, never let the audience feel putty for her. Every cry for help later matched with a subtle out bust of vial behavior, and verbal disgust of the character daughter India. India to me was a more sinister version of one of Mia previous character of Alice for Tim buttons Alice and wonderland. Mia manages to portray both a vulnerable but ferocious personality from the same character. Although Mia is still young she's had the chance to work with amazing directors and actors and some very different role, her diversity made her in my opinion the only person to play India's strange character. No one can question that Mia is a talented actor, with most women cringing at India creepy sexual awakening, after the murder of one of her class mates.These actors would all have been granted awards if there performance was more over played and dramatic, however this film would not have worked in these circumstances, neither would it have created the strong emotion response which it did. The sound an music in stoker also helped in creating a nervous response in the controversial yet excellent crafted film. However I'm not sure who we should be feeling nervous for. The ticking of the metronome only lasted a couple of minutes but has set in my memory for a life time. In my opinion this film is a sophisticated horror, with no sign of a chain saw or screaming girl, and a lot more power than any horror film I have ever seen. Stoker is a must see film for any film studies student, as there are so Many inviting element to analyse. This is not for the faint hearted with tragedy and tension around every Corner. Stoker is the type of film created to generate a strong response in an audience, although most audience may not agree with the film and call in UN- necessary, anyone with the slightest bit of imagination can appreciate the feature for its pure artistic beauty.",Stoker

Well, at one point in the movie you feel like the story indeed starts revealing itself and you wonder why you wasted almost two hours of your life realizing that there is no story at all! There is no development of the characters, no logic actions. The only good thing in the movie is its cinematography.

And since I really like slow moving psychological thrillers I gave this move an honest chance. That should not be given.The movie is well shot, well acted, yet utterly uninteresting. The story does not build up in any straight direction, you never know what is real and what is not and there is just so much confusion in the storytelling that I never really knew where I was standing. I began to wonder if there would be some grand twist in the end, and was waiting for it through one pointless scene after the other, just to realize the ending could be seen a mile away and all that confusing storytelling really amounts to absolutely nothing.I would recommend this movie only to people who can sit through two hours of something they are not exactly sure whether it is what you are watching.

I happen to fall under the former category. The cinematography is gorgeous, almost distractingly so, and the movie is, in fact quite slow paced, but with lots of nice little details that managed to keep my attention. The introduction of Charlie as a more ""hannibal-esque"" serial killer, and the gradual breakdown into the more conventionally neuroatypical Norman bates-ey murderer was very interesting for a fan of movies about serial killers to watch, but what really shone was Mia Wazikowska's melancholy, eerie India and her discovery of her murderous capabilities. The reveals, while forshadowed a bit heavily, still do their job, and the soundtrack, or lack thereof, really lends to the mood.

This movie is a thriller and mystery, but I feel that it is a psychological thriller. So, I love it more and more. The story line is very good, but the reason I love his film, is that the sensual elements of all the shots were good. I think there are several reasons that sensual elements. First, artistically every shot was full. Particularly, the props and art in the house stood out. Second, the shooting techniques were special. The best thing was when uncle and India are playing the piano in the living room ; The camera movement made me excited. Lastly, the story construction of the film. This movie shows the same scene repeatedly at the beginning and the ending. However, the first scene is a little different. It shows the still image. So, it is more attractive. Also, I think the human is an animal. So, I think that the human is showing animal instinct or madness.

It just seems odd that the young girl or niece of the psychopathic Uncle Charlie turned out to be a psychopathic over-night with her love and desire for murder, even despite the fact that she had a stable up bringing. Even the mysterious murder of the nanny and the other lady in the phone booth made no sense at all. It occurred to me that the real reason why he wanted that India girl to go down in the freezer was to try to tempt her with murder even without knowing that if this is her thing or not. I found the ending scene and murder of the sheriff disappointing and unnecessary and the scene where the Boyfriend neck was snapped off with his belt just didn't make much sense in the forest. The movie was like a combination of the Fear 1996 movie with Natural Born Killers 1994. It also seems odd that the Charlie character who has spent his whole life in a mental institution would be capable of murdering his father in the most horrific way imaginable and show no remorse for his actions and then inflict pain and torture on his family to full-fill his own selfish desires. The bottom line is watching the movie leaves you with a very bad taste in your mouth and demonstrates what the human race is capable of and this is why I award the film with one star.",Stoker
286,derfball,Don't pay to see this one !,2,12 December 2013,"Yes, stylized, imagery, and technically okay. But the plot holes and many details make no sense. 1> Charlie would have little knowledge of India; since he was locked up as a child, well before she was born, he would only know of her by what his brother might have mentioned to him. 2> Not liking to 'be touched' is a sign of serious issues, like warped familial relationships (her mother, okay), sexual abuse, or mental illness. Why would such a girl 'love' her father dearly? IF that condition WAS known to Charlie, that's why he felt 'connected' to India, because, as it turns out, both characters are sociopaths, and he had and recognized that trait. But he started writing to her just after she was born, so how would he know? 3> Almost ALL Hollywood writers/directors/producers have little real knowledge of weapons, as do most 'low information' folks, and this film is ridiculous, 'as usual'. EVERY hunter knows you don't hunt birds with rifles, because, as shown @ end, you hit a bird with a rifle bullet, the bird explodes -- pretty hard to either stuff it or eat it after that! I could go on, but why? If you want to see a flash of Mia's right nipple during her masturbating scene, fine, but that's about the best this picture has to offer. To compare it to Hitchcock's masterpieces does the rotund fellow disrespect. 'Stealing' his ideas and techniques is for student films. We don't need any more 'homages'.",Stoker
287,Jacob_Dunstan_Autumn,A Hypnotizing Puzzle,9,8 January 2014,"Stoker was one of the most visually interesting films to be released in 2013, or the past decade for that matter. There are some truly haunting images and visual motifs. The direction too, was excellent. Oftentimes unsettling, but rarely in an in-your-face sort of way, it's elliptical, non-linear storytelling and original editing will baffle some and captivate others. With ethereal echoes of early Peter Weir and Nicholas Roeg work, Stoker works as an enchanting drama, and a lurid mystery, populated with questionable characters. The art design/cinematography is a sight to behold. Lingering shots of the family's cavernous manor and sunlit grass fields have a sort of (welcome) stupefying effect on the viewer. Tribute must be paid to young Australian actress Mia Wasakowski too, for pulling this role off. She really nails the taciturn, grief-stricken India and masterfully portrays the character's incredibly troubled psyche (and troubling predilections) with realism. Credit need also be given to Goode as the unctuous uncle with a vague history and sinister motivations, and to Kidman as the paternally ineffectual, capricious widowed mother. Park Chan Wook may be one of the most inventive directors working today, and Stoker (his first foray into English language film-making) only serves to further validate such claims.",Stoker
288,becky-legnaro,family sweet family,8,3 September 2016,"As soon as you watch Stoker, your opinion about family bonds will not be the same anymore.Since from the opening shot your eyes are pleasantly amazed by the stunning cinematography of this movie. Everything is surrounded by a dream-like atmosphere and once you discover more and more about the mysterious quiet India and her family you will understand why.Matthew Goode and Nicole Kidman, who respectively play uncle Charlie and Eveline, are both excellent at portraying their characters and the camera movements keep the audience's concentration high all the time. What many might dislike, though, is the script, which sometimes appears to be too predictable.I do not want to repeat myself, but the cinematography is wonderful, how the director manipulate the viewer through mirrors and light is a good lesson to learn for anybody interested in filmmaking.I encourage everyone that likes thrillers to watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.",Stoker
289,nolacrazygrl,People are weird...,1,12 June 2021,"Those would be the people that are giving such high ratings - were they high while watching this?!When we watched the trailer, I said, ""well I can safely say I have no idea what that's about."" We gave it 30 minutes then turned it off. I cannot stand knowing a movie is 90 minutes long, and it's so slow that 1/3 of the way through there's still no excitement or anything that makes me want to continue watching. In that 30 minute period, all I could see was a weird, creepy uncle and his niece - Alice in Wonderland (big dining chair, the key, everything dark, exaggerated noises & the weird intro scenes, etc...oh and Mia, of course). I can typically think deeply beyond the surface of a movie that warrants it - this was not one of them.Yes it's dark (as in the colors presented on screen), but sorry, it's neither suspenseful nor attention grabbing/holding.",Stoker
