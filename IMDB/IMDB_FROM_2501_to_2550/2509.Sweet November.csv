0,moonspinner55,A new low in romantic comedy...,1,4 September 2006,"Abysmal remake of a just-OK 1968 romantic comedy turns the scenario from post-hippie quirkiness to an atrocious ""examination"" of the modern yuppie lifestyle. Keanu Reeves plays a recently-fired advertising executive who moves in with quirky Charlize Theron, a free spirit who takes one lover a month. In truth, the original film (which starred Sandy Dennis and Anthony Newley) relied more on the actors' personalities than on credibility or logic; revamped and updated, that lack of believability makes the whole enterprise look like a house of cards. Reeves, waving his arms around and talking like he has a nose-cold, bottoms out in this role; Theron looks attractive but is sunk by the witless script. NO STARS from ****",Sweet November
1,Quinoa1984,"One of the worst films I have seen not only this year, but in a while",1,19 February 2001,"Sweet November has two actors who actually weren't bad in a few things- Keanu Reeves in The Matrix and The Gift and Charlize Theron in The Cider House Rules.  But here, they are bad, and are less intruiging than they were in the last film they teamed up in- The Devil's Advocate (partly also because this isn't helped by Pacino).  The film is about to very disturbed people (in more ways than you'd think) who join together so the woman can help the man be a better person, and it is painful to watch it, even as a chick flick.  Overall, I don't reccomend it to anyone, unless you guys think that by being dragged by your lady you'll get lovin afterward (I'm sure you deserve it anyway after seeing this drek).

2,michaelRokeefe,November can be doubting and daunting.,3,9 April 2003,"This is a so-so remake of the 1968 Sandy Dennis vehicle and possibly more interesting...and that is not saying a whole lot. A romantic comedy about an eccentric(Charlize Theron)who coerces a busy advertising executive(Keanu Reeves)to move in with her so she can show him how to enjoy life more. The bathtub scene is cute. Nothing redeeming, but if you love Theron as I do, you will tolerate this whimsical pile of fluff. Reeves manages to be putty in her hands and still manage to keep his macho dignity. In support are Greg Germann, Jason Isaacs and Lauren Graham.",Sweet November
3,anaconda-40658,Not Sweet in Any Month.,3,11 May 2015,"Sweet November (2001): Dir: Pat O'Connor / Cast: Keanu Reeves, Charlize Theron, Jason Isaacs, Liam Aiken, Lauren Graham: Dreary depressing pill romance about that faithful day in November when workaholic Keanu Reeves is forced to live with Charlize Theron for an entire month so that she may change his outlook on life. Soon her illness surfaces leading to a depraved ending. Directed by Pat O'Connor who also made the miserable Inventing the Abbotts. Who did he wrong in order to be stuck with those two awful titles on his resume? The ending is totally predictable so feel free to beat yourself over the head with a bag of rocks. The film also asks an age old question. What is Theron attempting here anyway? She could lug in Jack the Ripper for all she knows. Why doesn't she do a crossword puzzle on the back of a cereal box instead. She plays the biggest stupidest idiot of any romantic film while Reeves plays a complete moron who will predictably come to love this woman rather than pass time by firing darts at pictures of her. Jason Isaacs plays Theron's cross-dressing friend who is there for support. One might say she would need it after starring in trash such as this. This becomes an example as to why males often hate going to date movies because junk like this reduces one's intelligence. Great locations cannot save this pathetic and manipulative snot rag story. Score: 3 / 10",Sweet November
4,elo-equipamentos,"Sweet November is a beautiful movie, however too utopic!!!",7,27 February 2021,"It seems to me a fine movie if us regard it as a fairy tale, it doesn't pass by the sieve of realism, the proposal is chastely an fictional romantic drama in an parallel dimension, all elements are gathered to build up a message that the whole world is wrong, there's an alternative, however it doesn't pay bills, raise children, get knowledge, anyway an utopic picture.Keanu Reeves play Nelson Moss a hard working executive on marketing with a highly reputable and successful career, until meeting accidentally Sara Deever (Charlize Theron) an oddball girl, they get involve each other in an unorthodox way, Sara asking to already unemployed Nelson, due he had overstepped the boundary of the professional ethic, Sara asking for him lives with her for the entire November to disclose a new way of life.That's the matter, the picture enforces so many contrived situations as a boy which doesn't has a father, so the little one asking Nelson adopts him, wait a minute it sounds silly and unusual to expose in a short time of relationship, also a man that never has a dog suddenly finds in love by this fine creatures, another flaw, who really love dogs it's coming from tender age, worst Nelson coming from lowest layer of society, working hard reach on the top, left all this behind to lives a contemplative life sounds weird, the movie is beautiful and endearing, however out of reality.

5,Smells_Like_Cheese,Sweet Autumn in New York in November,2,12 January 2004,"I remember when my best friend and I wanted to see a movie, this is strangely enough the first movie we ever saw together, sad start as this was just a pretty bad movie. Sweet November is another predictable pointless romantic movie that is trying too hard on the saps. Now I love Chalize Theron and Keanu Reeves, Charlize is an academy award winning actress with an awesome career, Keanu well, woah. Their chemistry was on in The Devil's Advocate, so I guess they were looking for a similar chemistry in a more sappy movie. The problem is that we had the movie Autumn in New York that same year Sweet November was released, also A Walk to Remember, Love Story, they're all the same exact scripts with different characters.Nelson Moss is a typical businessman who devotes his life to his career. He meets Sarah, a woman very different from anyone else he has ever met. His arrogance and ignorance leads to her failing her DMV test and she decides to track him down to make him pay for what he did. She continually asks him to spend a month with her, to be her ""November"", on the promise that she will change his life. That night she sleeps with him and the next day another man arrives in the apartment, a friend of Sarah's, who is able to identify Nelson as Sarah's ""November"". Nelson believes, quite rightly, that something strange is going on and leaves. Sarah then runs after Nelson and finally convinces him to stay with her for as long as he can. Throughout the course of November the two experience very happy times together and some breakups. But there's more that Sarah is hiding from Nelson then he realizes other than just being her ""November"".I don't mean to bash the movie so much, just these movies do tick me off where like I said it just seems like they're insulting our intelligence and taking old scripts, using a red crayon and scratching out the names and changing them just to pass by. Charlize was very adorable as Sarah, but these characters really don't have many redeemable qualities as they're very self absorbed and selfish. No matter what the motivation was, I wasn't feeling the romance and I wasn't feeling sorry for any of these jerks. I wouldn't really recommend this movie, I promise if you've seen any of the other movies I mentioned, then you've already seen Sweet November.2/10",Sweet November
6,=G=,More sap than Vermont in Winter.,4,17 May 2002,"""Sweet November"" 2001, a contempo regurgitation of a sappy 1968 flick, tells of a woman (Theron) who sets about to humanize a materialistic machine-like ad agency yuppie (Reeves) and, of course, they fall in love in the process (kiss, pant, purrrr, etc.). Straight from chick flick hell, this contrived nonsense with an impossible premise offers a thin weepy story,  Kodak moments galore, some transvestite characters and a kid to fill in the blanks,  angst ad nauseam, and the ever popular - drum roll, please - PUPPIES!! Only for die-hard romantics who can suspend disbelief at the drop of a hanky.",Sweet November
7,blanbrn,Decent romantic drama that shows the love between two people that are polar opposites lifestyle wise.,7,13 October 2008,"True a film like this of a love story developing between two polar opposite lifestyles may not be your cup of tea, but yet I for one liked ""Sweet November"" as it can give any hopeless romantic hope as it proves people with opposite lifestyles can share some love and happiness. Set in the ultra liberal city of San Franciso, California you have Nelson Moss(Keanu Reeves)as a clockwork go getting timed hard working plugged advertising executive who runs thru life yet he's successful his job is working. Also Nelson has a very attractive girlfriend in the proper and prissy Angelica(Lauren Graham). Yet is he really happy so by fate and chance meeting as is so common yet unexpected in life he meets a spur of the moment and bubbly Sara Deever(Charlize Theron). And this little lady has a knack for loving and changing the ways of new guys she meets! A feel good loving journey begins, as the on screen chemistry between Reeves and Theron sparkles. Also a nice eye candy scene at the films opening is a very sexy scene of Lauren Graham wearing a black bra and panties that certainly added some sugar and spice. Overall ""Sweet November"" is a decent romantic drama that proves anyone can love and obtain happy memories.",Sweet November

9,inkblot11,"Sweet story, perfect for a crisp November evening, with a large tissue box nearby",7,29 October 2007,"Nelson (Keanu Reeves) is a hotshot, workaholic ad man in San Francisco. His numerous awards in the industry have come at a price, however. He neglects his lovely girlfriend, Angelica (Lauren Graham) and has few other close friends and no hobbies but more work, work, and more work. One day, he is forced to leave the office and go to the DMV to renew his license. It is there that he meets the beautiful, bohemian Sarah (Charlize Theron). Unhappily for Sarah, however, Nelson causes her to lose her license for 30 days, due to his own selfish actions. She is miffed and ""follows him home"" to demand that he taxi her around for awhile. Although he is very upset about the situation, there is nothing for him to do but adhere to Sarah's wishes. Sarah is an astute student of human nature, to say the least, and she sees at once that his life is totally out of balance. Therefore, she proposes that Nelson move in with her ""for a month"" and she will help him make time to smell the roses. Nelson is horrified, at first, for he likes his life just fine. But, after he is suddenly fired from his job and his girlfriend, too, says adios, he reaches out to Sarah for help. Can this very pretty, unusual lady help Nelson? More importantly, does she have a secret agenda as well? This is a lovely film for those who adore tales of romance and drama. Reeves, one of the most beautiful people on the planet, gives a touching performance in his own, quiet way. Theron, also an attractive performer, lifts the soul as the free-spirited, great-hearted Sarah. Frank Langella appears briefly but admirably as a loathsome businessman. The rest of the cast, although not well known, performs well, too. With a setting in San Francisco, the scenery is most lovely while the costumes, including Sarah's quirky clothes, are lively and fun. Production values, too, are of the finest. As for the script, it is polished and virtually guaranteed to give one big lumps in the throat. Do you long for tales of undying love, with plentiful doses of warmth and weeping? You should get this one now, even if November is months away from today.",Sweet November

All the characters are cool, and extremely likable, and I found the 2nd half to be great and very emotional, plus Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron are simply amazing in this!. I have not seen the original, but I must say I really liked this one, and it may take a while for you to warm up To Reeves's character Nelson because he's an arrogant jackass at 1st, plus he and Charlize had fantastic chemistry together!. I thought the ending was very well done, even though I wished it didn't end that way, and I feel this should be higher then 5.5, plus it's very well made and written as well!. It really took a sudden turn in the second half, but that's OK because I still enjoyed it and you will find Charlize to be utterly irresistible in this! plus I loved the music score as well, and found it to be very beautiful. The character development is pretty good, and you will feel for the 2 leads, plus I loved Keanu's Santa thing he did in the 2nd half. This is a very sweet romantic/Comedy,that I quite enjoyed, with top notch performances, and a really charming story, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Pat O'Connor does a great! job here with good camera work, and keeping the film at a fast pace. The Acting is top notch!. Keanu Reeves is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is jackass in the 1st half, but really turns out to be a likable guy once he falls in love with Sara, he also had fantastic chemistry with Charlize, brought charisma, and is a surprisingly good singer! (Reeves Rules!!!!!!!). Charlize Theron is also amazing as always, she is incredibly gorgeous, wonderfully perky, had a brilliant character, was perfectly charming, full of life, and was just amazing overall I loved her! (Charlize Rules!!!!). Jason Isaacs is funny as Chaz, he had a weird character but was likable and caring, I dug him!. Frank Langella is good as the ass I liked him. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5",Sweet November
11,lisafordeay,Very underrated gem with Keanu Reeves,6,20 May 2015,"Sweet November is a 2001 Romantic Drama starring Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron. Nelson Moss(Reeves) is a cynical guy who meets a young quirky woman named Sara(played by Charlize Theron) who he meets after she failed her driving test. She later asks Nelson that she wants him to live with her for the full month of November and then she will leave him after the month is up. Things get complicated however when Nelson starts to fall in love with Sara but she is hiding a terrible secret from him as he spots her taking pills and quizzes her up about it. We later find out that she has Hopkins disease and she's actually dying(almost like Nicolas Sparks A Walk To Remember).Bottom line I enjoyed this film as I always liked Keanu Reeves since Speed and the chemistry he had with Charlize Theron was good yet she comes across as a real nutjob stalking Nelson(Reeves) and forcing him to be her boyfriend for a month as she wants to do a project on breaking up with men due to her illness.I was surprised that it's a remake of a 1968 film of the same name. The movie is so bad it's even got an award for a Razzie. If you like City Of Angels, A Walk To Remember or even The Lakehouse do check it out.",Sweet November
12,noralee,Strictly for Fans of Keanu's Romantic Movies,2,6 December 2005,"""Sweet November"" isn't any more ridiculous with a slutty compromised lead woman than ""Pretty Woman."" But I assume this is not a date movie, judging by the constant, loud, annoying, derisive comments from the men in the audience who I assume were convinced to come by the presence of co-star Charlize Theron but were probably peeved that this is her first film with no breast-bearing as the producers chickened out of a ""R"" rating at the last minute. The toned-down practically Hays Commission sex we do see does hurt the slight plot, as the only reason we're really given that Keanu Reeves's character stays around at first must be due to this great invisible sex. That Theron is suddenly revealed to have a beautiful bout of non-AIDS Movie Star Disease has a long tradition, going back at least to the most gorgeous consumptive in history, Garbo in ""Camille."" Though the presumption that the gay couple down the hall (who in practically a first in movies have gainful employment) was better suited to take care of her than her lover was a bit odd -- why, because they have experience with chronically ill friends or something?The Mom in ""Gilmore Girls"" has a couple of lines where she manages to turn The Girlfriend role into a tart commentator.The soundtrack songs are a complete mish-mash from pop to Enya that make no selection sense, cohesion or commentary.Regardless, I'm someone who stayed through ""A Walk in the Clouds"" twice so I guess I just enjoy watching Keanu in romantic movies. Well, maybe in any movies. (originally written 2/25/2001)",Sweet November
13,MarieGabrielle,This film deserves a good review...,8,29 April 2006,"Especially since I am not really a fan of romantic comedies/drama. This is not really a comedy per se, as there is a dramatic element to it, and the performances should not be so easily dismissed.Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves look good together; Keanu is not playing a superficial action role, so the focus is not on him. This is a good thing, especially as we can then appreciate Charlize Theron's performance as Sara Deaver, a quirky girl who Nelson (Keanu) meets at the DMV in San Francisco. San Francisco is an interesting backdrop- the positive aspects of it are emphasized, and it becomes another character in the film.Jason Isaccs plays Chaz Cherry, the local cross-dresser who is Theron's friend and confidante. He does well in this, and last night I actually saw him in ""Friends With Money"", wherein his talent was literally wasted. Liam Aiken portrays Abner, who is quasi-adopted by Theron and Reeves, as their relationship develops.There are some funny scenes, like where Greg Germann (Reeves' co-worker at an ad agency) orders cappuccino and is told off by the waitress. Also where Reeves is presenting an ad campaign for hot dogs, and he eventually flips out.The film works because it is not a gushing romance film; I am not a big fan of Reeves but he was very good in this film. Theron was excellent, as always, and there are some beautiful shots of the Bay in San Francisco, a nice backdrop for a bittersweet romance.",Sweet November
14,Enchorde,"Great romantic drama, completely underrated",8,29 September 2009,"Recap: Nelson, a man in the fast lane, highly talented advertising consultant and workaholic to boot. Time is money, and success is everything. Anything else is second to that, even his girlfriend. Even his own personal life. She gets sick of it and leaves, but not before an overstressed Nelson manages to get fired. But then he has just met Sara. Sara is a down to earth, seemingly crazy girl with an odd set of rules. She just wants one month, to wake him up. To save him. But time is the one thing that is most difficult to give.Comments: This is a movie that really leapt on me. Or mostly it was Theron's character Sara that enthralled me. Such warmth, such joy de vivre is rarely seen and even more seldom actually felt coming across the screen. And, like Nelson, I find her totally captivating. She really is this movie.Keanu Reeves are more limited with emotions and do not come across the screen as well as Theron do. But for one he and his character is not supposed to, not until the end at least and he does warm up considerably. He also does provide a nice and almost needed contrast to Sara, as another character like her would be too much.Also well worth mentioning is Jason Isaacs that are really impressive in an odd but interesting supporting character.I find it surprising that this movie wasn't considered for any more awards than the Razzie. Especially Theron's acting was impressive, and she certainly didn't deserve a Worst Actress Nomination.If you haven't figured it out already I really like this movie. It was a movie that managed to captivate me. It was so full of emotion it was hard to resist. Also there is something mysterious and secret behind Sara's façade, and it is almost impossible not to come to care for this woman. In addition to finding out how the relation between Sara and Nelson developed (but that almost came to be secondary), I really wanted to know her secret.I think this is a movie that should be seen with a certain someone. With all the emotions flowing, some really nice scenes and a really fitting soundtrack it is almost perfect for a nice evening at home, just the two of you.8/10",Sweet November
15,rbverhoef,"A bad movie, but...",5,3 August 2003,"'Sweet November' starts as a predictable romantic comedy where you feel something will change and then it turns into a predictable romantic drama. The movie starts with a 50-minute introduction before the plot, well, ""plot"", really begins. In this first 50 minutes we see what kind of workaholic Nelson Moss (Keanu Reeves) is. We also see how he makes Sara Deever (Charlize Theron) fail a drivers license-test because of his cheating. He has to pay her back by driving her somewhere and after that he has to drink coffee with her. She discovers he is a not very happy workaholic and that he never does anything fun. She offers him to make his life fun, no work, for one month (November of course) but he has to live with her. Sure he declines but fortunately he is fired and he loses his girlfriend Angelica (played by the lovely Lauren Graham) on the same day. So he becomes Sara's November.Here we are almost halfway the movie and we feel that things are not as they seem. I will not reveal too much about the things that follow but it is all pretty predictable so you can guess it right anyway. There is also a silly little subplot involving a boy without a father (it must be very easy to guess this right) and a subplot involving two transvestite neighbors. You understand that the story is not that great, may be even a little stupid. So what about other things you might enjoy in a movie? The chemistry between Reeves and Theron is alright but I liked them better in 'The Devil's Advocate' and that movie didn't even require them to have much chemistry. There is a funny supporting role by Greg Germann, who is known from Ally McBeal, but he is pretty much the character he portrays there.I didn't like the ending as well but when you really think about it no ending would be satisfying in a movie like this. May be this was the best thing to do although you have to notice the setting for the closing scene. It is one of those quite beautiful places this kind of things never happen. Why not just any corner of any street? After reading all this you must think I really hated the movie but that is not true. I have a strange thing with romantic comedies, or just romantic movies, and for some reason I enjoy watching almost all of them. I can see how bad they sometimes are but I like them anyway. I definitely can't recommend this movie but if you can have the same feeling I have with this genre you might enjoy it.",Sweet November
16,PredragReviews,Keanu Reeves + Charlize Theron = Great Chemistry on screen!,8,11 January 2017,"There are very few romantic drama/comedies where the two characters part in anything like this way, nor does the illness of the Theron character get revealed until the middle of the film. Certainly, the approach of the Theron character to her life is very unusual. Charlize Theron brings on her charm, and Keanu Reeves turns in a surprisingly worthy performance in a movie that's as light as a fall breeze. Yes, the way in which the two develop their romance is a bit tough to swallow at first, but if you can ignore that and allow their growing relationship to touch your heart, then the movie succeeds on those terms. It seems preposterous, but with a movie like this, the events come in such an order that you can forgive these little pitfalls. Their budding romance really does have a kick to it, and despite the outside criticism, Theron and Reeves do have some good on screen chemistry that lights up the screen in moments and provides for some very touching moments.The film also has a lot of warm-hearted laughs. A scene in which Sara stands outside Nelson's apartment and begins shouting risqué comments at people in order to gain his attention will have you chuckling, while her neighbors, two homosexuals who host a dinner party for the four of them in drag, are a riot. And the overall sweet nature of the relationship between the two is something to smile about, as well as shed a few tears over. In one of his better roles, Keanu Reeves is convincingly emotional as Nelson. In the beginning, her perfectly portrays the egotistical attitude and outlook of his character, and then makes a very believable segue to someone who is so in love he is willing to change his whole life. Charlize Theron is, as always, a gem, bringing a touch of warmth and cheerfulness to her role as Sara. Her acting embodies her character with the zest for life needed to sell us on Sara's motives, and Theron captures that completely. It met all of my expectations, which were few, but the fact that it met them is enough to recommend the film! Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Sweet November
17,Vomitron_G,No fairy-tale is meant to last forever...,7,20 January 2007,"Apparently, SWEET November is a re-make from a movie originally made in 1968. I still haven't seen the original, and when I recently went into this 2001 version, I expected a rather superficial romantic comedy about a girl who changes boyfriends every month. Unsuspectedly, I got much more out of it (even on a personal level). The movie begins fairly light-hearted, but near the end you'll have to endure some pretty heavy-weight drama. The good thing is: None of it all ever becomes cheap. But if you're an emotional human being, it's almost a 100% sure that at one point or another you will feel the urge to shed a tear. Although the ending itself is the most obvious part that will cause viewers to swallow or make their eyes go all watery, my moment of feebleness was when Keanu Reeves brought back the little puppy to Charlize Thereon as a surprise gift.I'd describe this film as a moving romantic drama with touches of comedy. The screenplay itself is like a softly rippling stream that takes you on a gentle ride. And it never changes its ways... No storm will take you by surprise... No whirlpool will suddenly drag you down... But slowly, dark and ominous clouds will darken the sky above you. So, indeed, Nelson Moss inevitably discovers the real reason why Sara Deever wanted him to be her November boyfriend. My idea is that most people will see this coming from miles away (for one thing because of several subtle hints, both in the screenplay and visuals, are being given). And I also believe that the movie intended it that way. But what probably wasn't the intention, was me figuring out at the 36 minutes mark exactly what was wrong with Sara Deever, even down to the exact nature of her condition. It was in the scene where Sara was making eggs for breakfast, after their first night together, it suddenly hit me. So, that was sort of a little bummer there, me knowing it from then on. Instead of fully enjoying all the romantic stuff between them, and witnessing how they grew towards each other, a part of me was constantly waiting for the 'signs' to reveal themselves.Still, it didn't spoil too much. However, there was one big 'party-pooper'-scene. I won't go into it, but... how the hell did Nelson manage to walk out of a hospital unseen, carrying a terminally ill patient (who was on a heart-monitoring machine) in his arms without one single person of the medical staff noticing him? It was the one and only moment that I 'went out of the movie' and just shook my head going ""Yeah, right..."". But gladly, I quickly got over it and enjoyed the rest of the movie. The ending is just damn good. Even though some part of me didn't want it to end that way, it still was the only way I wanted it to end. And I'm aware that saying this might make me sound like as if I'm a barrel full of contradictions, but just see the movie and you'll understand it.I have absolutely nothing bad to say about the performances of the whole cast. Charlize Theron especially shone in this one and even Keanu Reeves was enjoyable in every way (from the go-getter he was in the beginning of the movie to the likable and caring person he became at the end). As far as the comedy aspects go in SWEET November, that scene where he explained his new ""hot dog campaign"" during the meeting was simply hilarious. I even re-watched that one scene the next day and was grinning all the way through it.So yep, I think this is a very good movie and it sure was a pleasant surprise for me. I'd probably be rating it even higher if it wasn't for those one or two little fun-spoilers I mentioned earlier... Hmmm... and maybe I also missed one truly hot and steamy sex-scene between Keanu and Charlize there. But still, SWEET November is a movie for all to enjoy, except maybe for those of you who have this way too cynical look on life and love. To them I can only say: Lighten up, you're deteriorating the quality of your life and the lives of people close to you.Have a nice day!*** Thanx to this special person (who wanders around on this site often) for recommending this movie to me. She knows who she is and I dedicate this review to her.***",Sweet November

19,mattymatt4ever,"Starts on a sour note, but sweetens up as it goes",7,7 August 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** ""Sweet November"" gets off to a bumpy start.  Charlize Theron's character is first established as sort of a...well...borderline psychopath.  Theron bumps into Keanu Reeves during a DMV exam.  The two of them have a weird encounter in the parking lot.  Later on, that night, she shows up at his apartment. He doesn't know how the hell she got his address.  Since she failed the DMV exam, she asks him for a ride.  Now, at this point, he should be terrified at this woman!  He barely knows her and suddenly she asks him for a favor? After a long period of arguing, he finally succumbs to this favor.  Then she breaks into this building and steals a dog.  At this point Keanu should be even more terrified!  But he keeps driving her.  She invites him up to her place for cocoa.  Again a conflict he finally succumbs to.  She explains the whole ""Spend a Month With Me and I'll Change Your Life"" deal.  Of course, at first he says no.  He's a workaholic with no time for this crap.  He makes a bad presentation for his advertising firm, he loses his temper and his job. Then he thinks, ""What the hell.  I'll go to this crazy b*tch's place and see what this is all about.""  He obviously can't stand her at first.  The way she lives such a simple life, totally contradictory to his.  Night falls, things heat up and the two of them are already in the sack!  Now that's just a cheap attempt to have two hot actors heat up the screen.  Keanu's character can't even stand being near her, yet he's suddenly ripping her clothes off and tackling her to the couch?  Another one of those only-in-the-movies moments.Luckily, the film's appeal increases as it goes along.  The performances by the two leads are strong, though I can't help but feel Charlize was a little miscast.  For some reason, I don't picture her nebbish character as a beautiful woman with no facial blemishes.  I mean, even Gwyneth Paltrow was convincing in ""Bounce,"" because they didn't try to make her look beautiful. Half of the film she's wearing hardly any makeup.  But that's a flaw I was able to look over.  The point is the two characters are so likable and the two actors have such a cute chemistry that I couldn't hate this movie (past the 30-minute mark).  The moments they share are genuine, and though I don't think Keanu's character arc would've been generated quite so successfully I was willing to look that over as well.  Yes, this is moderately standard Hollywood fluff, but it works.  And I was oddly captivated.
I also wish I could've been given a better explanation about Charlize's whole ""Spend a Month With Me"" deal.  It's a pretty strange concept, and something that should've been explained with more detail.  You mean EVERY month she can actually get a guy to live with her, no strings attached? As if she's a guardian angel and she just patrols the streets of San Francisco looking for her next customer, who seemingly needs help?  And I'm sure, out of all those guys, Keanu is not the first one she had actual feelings for. Women are more libidinous than you think.  I also wanted a better explanation of the Jason Isaacs character.  Was he gay or what?  Maybe I misinterpreted, but did him and Charlize use to go out?  Is he bisexual? And what was that whole family crisis that Charlize had to deal with? There's a good deal of loose ends in this story that were either not clearly explained or not explained at all.  And this is not a Hitchcock thriller, so you can't tell me the characters and plotlines were meant to be enigmatic.I have to say, I did appreciate the ending.  It wasn't overly sentimental, and I still found it sad and touching.  And it sort of left things open-ended.  One of those ""Where Do I Go From Here?"" conclusions.  But someone did point out something interesting--the trailers almost ruined the film!  You see, in the ads, Charlize lying in hospital bed with her face completely pale.  Geez, I wonder what to expect?  I assumed the plot was Charlize was dying and she wanted to spend the last days of her life with Keanu.  It's times like this I wish they stuck with the teaser trailers.
""Sweet November"" is not a great movie, but it's sad, touching, sometimes funny and contains two fine performances.  It has an odd appeal to it. One of those films you want to keep on watching for no explicit reason.  You don't know why you're into it, you just are.  Maybe it's a guilty pleasure, maybe not.  Who knows?  But I'd be a lying, pretentious snob if I were to say I didn't like it.  This is just my take.My score:  7 (out of 10)",Sweet November
20,petra_ste,"""Odious"" pretty much sums it up",3,11 September 2008,"Betraying a deep disrespect for its target audience and all the emotional authenticity of a cat food commercial, Sweet November is the kind of movie which piles up cliché after cliché in an obvious attempt to please people craving for a facile feel-good romantic comedy.Young, beautiful, rich people falling in love and fooling around all day? Check.He (Keanu Reeves) is a pompous jerk, she (Charlize Theron, deserving better) is a fun-loving gal who teaches him apparently-simple-but-actually-deep life lessons? Check.Cute dog? Check.Cute kid? Check.Gay confidante? Check.Romantic dusk? Check.Romantic dawn? Check.Cheap plot twist involving a deadly illness (Charlize is supposed to look like a terminal cancer patient because, in the last act, she starts crying a lot) in an ending which pretends to be bittersweet but only comes across as phoney? Check.However, I have to say Keanu is the usual genius of unintentional comedy. There is something hilarious about his performance - he has the mechanic, artificial body language of a puppet, even the way he moves his eyelids and mouth. Also funny is the way he talks: words come out in a staccato pattern which gives the impression of someone periodically pulling a string behind his back. 3/10",Sweet November
21,rainking_es,I didn't want to!!,3,14 September 2005,"Romantic comedy/drama... Well, I must confess those aren't my favorite genres. For me they're all the same: so predictable, so demagogic, always looking for your basic instincts. A girl which is seriously ill falls in love with a guy but she doesn't want their story to last because of her condition, blablablabla.... So sad! Poor girl.What to say about Keanu Reeves, the man without expression... and Miss Theron, well, she's a very beautiful woman. Hehehe... I don't know what else to say about this s**t! I think it is quite advisable for those devotes of the romantic genre (or those who love Keanu). Why did I watch it? It is so embarrassing... my girl made me watch it!

22,FlickJunkie-2,Lackluster romantic tragedy,5,8 August 2001,"This lackluster romantic tragedy is a weak treatment of a threadbare storyline, further diminished by spotty acting.  The story is shamelessly familiar.  Boy falls in love with girl whom he learns is dying, and he becomes transformed by his love for her as she wastes away.  Kleenex stock rises.Anyone who saw `Autumn In New York' with Winona Ryder and Richard Gere, released earlier the same year, probably had an overwhelming sense of déjà vu watching this film, right down to the season.  This film could very well have been titled `Autumn in San Francisco'.  It was basically the same film with different topography and local color.  However, while the first was well acted with sensitive and insightful character development, this is just a schmaltzy bouillabaisse of sappiness that is spread broadly but thinly.Keanu Reeves, who should have been perfect for the part, wasn't.  In the beginning of the film, he plays a high powered advertising executive with a presentation that is so forced it can only be described as robotic.  Once he wades back into more familiar waters and settles into the romantic role, he seems to be more comfortable and natural, but he still presents a character that is far to stoic to be endearing.  In contrast, Charlize Theron gives a charming and emotionally compelling performance and single-handedly keeps the film from foundering.  Theron gives her character great range and endows her with a kookiness that belies her depth.  Unfortunately, Reeves is so inert in this film that the romantic chemistry between them is as exciting as last night's dishwater.Director Pat O'Connor (`Inventing the Abbots') did what he could to enliven the film with some nice location shots around San Francisco and some well assembled romantic montages (that might have crossed the line into the overkill zone).  However, his handling of Reeves was poorly done.  I have seen Reeves give numerous performances that were far better than this.  When an accomplished actor comes off this uninspired, I put the blame squarely at the feet of the director.  Also, I feel that the character development was sorely lacking, with O'Connor content to present superficial skits rather than delve into anyone's psyche.Though not awful, this film requires a strong cup of coffee or an incredibly sentimental viewer.  I rated it a 5/10.  Anyone who liked Keanu Reeves in films like `The Matrix' and `Speed' should prepare to deduct a point or two. Worth a try for romance junkies.",Sweet November
23,famousgir1,Really Makes You Think....,10,17 July 2001,"*****SPOILERS*****Sweet November is one of those movies, that really makes you think. It's a great film which is very meaningful and quite sad too. Keanu Reeves stars as Nelson Moss. Nelson is one of those guys that works 24 hours a day and just doesn't have any fun. When stranger- Sara Deever offers him a chance to spend a whole month with her, he obviously refuses. I mean, it's crazy, a woman asking him something like that, but when his girlfriend dumps him and he loses his job, he decides to take up the offer and get's more then he bargained for when they both fall in love with each-other. Usually, Hollywood movies like this have happy endings but Sweet November sadly didn't. Still, the movie was great and Keanu Reeves was brilliant as usual. I've never really been to keen on Charlize Theron. She usually seems so boring, but I guess she did quite a good job here and you could see she enjoys working with Keanu. (Especially, since they've worked together before on The Devil's Adcovate.) Anyway, Sweet November is a great movie with lovely music and I give it a 10/10.",Sweet November

25,tributarystu,Predictable yet entertaining,6,28 April 2003,"I was floating through the web and landed as usually here, at the Internet Movie Database. I had seen this movie with Jason Isaacs(note-with Jason Isaacs not with Keanu Reeves) and I wanted to know the English name...and, why not, the user rating. To my surprise, this last one was much, much lower than I had expected in my wildest dreams. I don't like to refer to the imdb user ratings, but I can't really remember a time when the difference between what I imagined and what is was bigger. Oh well...let's jump to it.SPOILERSI can't say it's a terribly original story, but it ain't bad either. I have not seen any movies too similar to it, so I guess it does carry its share of originality...until a certain point. That's actually a big issue, something that really troubles me. The idea that people can't live their life unless they're dying or anywhere near. I mean, that's just plain stupid. Life can be beautiful if you ain't dying too! But I guess that's too plain to be worth showing...better show this melodramatic thing. To the story...well, it was written to please the majority of people. This was most obvious, not only as a whole, but at a certain scene: the meeting with Price. It's the ""inhuman"" character Price represents and its that big share of humanity in Nelson. The idea is that we should love Nelson so we get him take the side of feelings...well, predictable is the word for it.The acting is good...I don't see why I should complain. I especially liked Jason Isaacs. I am quite a fan of his, so it's not really a surprise, but I just couldn't believe my eyes and I kept saying: That's not him! I don't know why, but I didn't trust my instincts until the credits.Keanu was...Keanu. I like the fact that he can play as different type of characters and I think it fit him very well. It is strange if you think of all the things reality brings with it...but what we are presented is not reality...not our reality.Charlize Theron was amazing! She just had that charm with her that made her ""loveable"". This is a quality many stars lack...especially female ones. There's always a difference between ""hot"" and ""beautiful"". It's kind of nice when ""she's"" got both.About the negative parts...I think I'll stick with the predictability. But as a whole the movie is good. I especially liked the music which made you feel quite fuzzy. It was beautiful. I also saw some images which said more than a thousand words. Superbly shot. It's hard to express that much in a picture and I haven't seen it too often lately. Get to see this film...I think it will make you feel good. It's never good to be a constant critic. Kind of takes the charm away from the movies. Just relax and watch. 8/10",Sweet November
26,ssvikas,"Mushy and Predictable, but tells a story. Check out Charlize Theron.",6,2 November 2005,"Plot Outline: Nelson (Keanu Reeves) high-flying, cold blooded ad-exec bumps into free spirit Sara (Charlize Theron) in a DMV test. Sara spots Nelson as an overworked jerk who needs to learn more about life and offers him to stay with her for a month as her 'November'. Although reluctant initially, Nelson allows himself in after losing a campaign and his job in a fit of rage. Nelson sure comes to Sara's ways and falls for her, but against her expectations, she too ends up falling for him. Other characters include Sara's neighbor Chaz, a happier guy from Nelson's Industry, Abner, the neighborhood kid, a couple of transvestites, and Nelson's parasitical colleague Vince.Comment: I'd never heard of this movie till in late-2003 when a friend actually recommended this one as a must see. The story with its typical characters like an overworked-ambitious workaholic, a terminally ill carefree female who doesn't need to work, a cool headed and successful competitor from the same industry, a couple of weird people like the transvestites and a kid to whom Nelson plays surrogate father make the story quite predictable similar to the staple ones of Bollywood. What makes it different is a character like Sara who spots 'troubled' people and offers them to live with her for a month and change them. Well, if not in a movie, Nelson wouldn't have probably agreed to move in with a complete stranger, that too a clumsy weirdo like her.Although the movie is professed as a love story, I am yet to understand the Director's perspective of love in the movie. Nelson could have fallen for Sara just because he was in deep trouble in his life with career and relationship failures that he found an opening in a care free Sara who on the other hand dated people to feel the need for control. Should love be either circumstantial like for Nelson or the woman on top approach of Sara? By saying this, I'm sure the folks who would rather love a tear-jerker would be offended. The lead Reeves, with his usual confused look seems more like Neo than Nelson. Charlize Theron is the best thing about this movie who although clumsy is yet likable.Putting aside shortcomings in narrative and character development, the film makes some points. (i) Work, but do it for a living and don't live in it, (ii) Stop by to see life from another's perspective, (iii) Weird friends could be better than the parasitic ones, (iv) Stronger decisions need innate conviction like the way Nelson turns down Edgar Price and (v) finally, that life with all its limitations is much better than we usually think.

All of a sudden, one November she welcomes in Keanu and, surprise, she falls in love with him and doesn't want to let him go!  Now a twist in the story develops but you probably already know if from the television trailers that made it a point to advertise only the end of the film.Even if you find the set-up interesting, it's hard to find the execution of it all more than contrived.

Sure, the basic premise is rather outlandish, but so are the plots of Star Wars, Dirty Harry etc. What I'm saying is that despite the poor reviews from major the critics this film is filled with effective moments of both pathos and drama. I saw the original once many years ago and if memory serves, the producers should have re-created that films ending instead of the not quite satisfying finale in the remake.

Charlize Theron plays Sara, your standard eccentric stalker type out to save the world (and apparently independently wealthy).  Keanu Reeves plays Neo, a computer hacker pretending to be an advertising executive named Nelson.  It was not one of his better roles.  Anyway, Nelson meets Sara, Sara proceeds to play the lovable stalker and Nelson falls in love.  The fascinating theme they could have played with was the idea of a woman who has this habit of inviting a man into her life for one month, to help them and then to move on.  Had that been the theme of the movie this could have been an interesting character study.  But, they instead proceed to move into the greatest movie cliche of them all:  (spoilers here, so watch out)  she's dying of a non-disfiguring disease.  Actually, I figured it out pretty quickly, so I'm sure you will as well.  From there the coincidences, cliches, and plot holes begin to pile up so high you can't see the screen anymore.

I remember vaguely being a little dis-satisfied when I saw it on the big screen. It seemed to play a little better this time on TV, but there was a feeling I had that was beyond the obvious umpteenth remake of Love Story feeling.This one to me played a lot better than the previous copy, Autumn in New York, with Gere and Ryder that was bottom of the barrel. I could not put my finger on it until I got to the closing credits and saw that the writer was Herman Raucher who wrote Summer of '42.It was then that I realized that at the end of the movie I had the same pleasantly bittersweet ""things happen but life goes on"" feeling that I had at the end of '42. The difference was that the rest of the movie did not even remotely compare to '42 which is on my personal list of all time favorites.I was a youngster in '42. I have been to both Nantucket and many times to San Francisco. Whereas '42 captured the spirit and feeling of an age, place and an era very faithfully, November is a sham of portraying SF, the characters, or anything else.

A chemistry that worked pretty well in the Devil's Advocate is totally absent from Theron-Reeves here.  And here there is no Al Pacino to play off.This movie has no sense of direction, no real story, no characters you care about, and fails to explore anything with interest potential.  It cannot decide whether it is a comedy, a tragedy, a catharsis, or who knows what.The two attractive stars give perhaps their worst performances.  Neither character is believable or even likable.  Even the score pirates snippets of other pieces and does not see them to their musical maturity.Paths not taken:  1)The neighbor kid Abner is not explored or exploited and you wonder why the kid even remembers Nelson, 2)The wise gay neighbor is a powerful ad exec, but we hear no more about it, even though he is a direct competitor of Nelson's, 3)The dysfunction in Theron's family is manifest only by half a phone conversation, 4)It is never clear why Reeves relents and goes to stay with Theron for the title month.This is a real loser!",Sweet November

And why was this movie made in the first place? Poor character development. You really don't know why Sara takes strangers in her house. The movie just goes from scene to scene, throwing in all these additional characters involved in Sara's life somehow with again no explanation. I do not think the romance between the 2 main characters was played out well or developed strongly enough.Towards the end of the movie we learn she has been terminally ill then abruptly puts and end to their romance.

43,baba44713,"Awful, awful, and... yes, awful.",2,13 February 2006,"First of all, I didn't see the original movie. Based on this one, I think I never will.Here's the plot. Keanu is a hot-shot marketing agent. You know the type, working 24-7, mistreats his hot girlfriend, watches roughly seventeen TVs while doing his morning exercise. In other words, a regular prick.Charlize on the other hand is not. She's a free spirit, finds joy in small unimportant fuzzy little things, like walking 10 poodles by the beach or playing hide and seek. She also doesn't care about her appearance, she does her hair with a vacuum cleaner and dresses what she finds on the floor. Of course, that doesn't prevent her from looking spectacular and having perfect hair and make-up in every scene but let's not nitpick here. Oh, except when she gets sick which is indicated by her not wearing makeup.So anyway, Charlize starts to harass Keanu because he was responsible for getting her kicked out from driving exam. Hey, this looks like a perfect setup for some great romantic comedy, right? He'll hate her, she'll hate him, they will put practical jokes on each other and finally fall in love, right? Wrong. This plot goes right out of the window, and is changed with Charlize insisting of ""helping"" Keanu, which consists of moving in with her, doing fun things (including having hot sex with aforementioned) and generally getting more relaxed and being less, well, a prick.Now here we come to the basis of my intense hatred for this movie. I really hate this Hollywood ""free spirit"" characters who spread joy and happiness and try to tell me how to Really Enjoy Life. Well, listen up, miss Charlize or Sara or whatever her name in the movie was, I'd really like to play silly games all day and have long warm baths, and throw away my cell-phone and forget about my daily job but, get this, I NEED TO EARN FOR THE LIVING. Like I need some overpaid Hollywood actor to tell me that regular every-day routine is boring. Sure, give me ten million dollars, I'll walk the dogs all day and relax and have fun. Geez. Back to the movie. Keanu puts up a small fight, but since Charlize is kinda hot instead of calling the police or at least psychiatric hospital he falls for her and eventually accepts her ways. And, lo and behold, he becomes A Better Person. Wee. Thanks Charlize, your psycho promiscuous ways really DO help.But of course, all is not well in Happy Fantasy Land where you can goof around and run willy-nilly all day and still manage to pay your rent and bills and eat food in nice restaurants. There is a dark reason why Charlize lives like she does and has a one-month dating policy. And oh no, say it ain't so, this ""comedy"" turns into a sappy soap-opera. Like I cared, since I hated both of the protagonists anyway.There is absolutely no need to see this movie. It's not funny, it's not moving, it's basically a big nothing. I even skipped over some things and characters in this crap that are not just totally pointless but actually manage to takes this movie further down a notch . Take that kid for example. Or the utterly clichéd drag/gay neighbour. Look, that men is wearing a dress. Some prime comedic material there. Or what about.. but I'll stop here. Watch the movie and make your own I-hated-this list afterwards, so we can compare.2/10 P.S. Oh I almost forgot. If you need to move furniture around the house, please call Keanu Reeves.

The director's lack of interest, poor script, poor writing. The dialogs are plain even though there's a bit of insight from time to time. All the potential subplots that are left hanging prevent the viewer from bonding with the characters. Reeves is bad, Charlize is good and even though there's a little chemistry there, as a couple they fail to deliver.

After a small eternity of banter between these two losers: ""Let me help you!""/""Get away from me!"", Nelson gives in and wastes time with Sarah for 4 weeks he will never get back while the audience sits through this grueling torture for 2 solid hours which they will never get back.Somewhere along the way, Nelson has (surprise!) fallen in love with Sarah. He professes his devotion by climbing up the fire escape and crashing Sarah's dinner party to deliver 12(!) clumsy presents including live birds and lit candles and the film still doesn't have a happy ending.Incredulous storyline isn't bad for laughs if you've got enough Bacardi.",Sweet November
47,michaelthompsonmcgill,Wonderfully acted. A Superb Love Story. Definitely for the hard hearted.,10,8 May 2011,"I have read the reviews and agree with most. But there is something missing here regarding negative reviewers.There are people today who frown on sentimentality, because to some people, sentimental people are weak, and / or soft people.And the added truth is that behind every person who hates the average love story, is a person who cries inside when they are moved to tears by movies packing an emotional punch, just like this one did.Some people are afraid to show emotion because they feel it too much, because some people are emotional people.So when these type of people watch an emotional film they are forced to be critical, when what these people are really doing is being critical of themselves.Sweet November was very sad, very moving, and acted with absolute sincerity.It really would serve the world better if men particularly, were not afraid to show emotion for fear of being labelled soft, and weak.I think if we were not such a macho hard nosed capitalistic world, sentimentality would be accepted much more.Because Sweet November was superb on all those levels where human emotion cannot, not, be aroused.",Sweet November
48,phantom_pixie,"Another sappy story that is just not plausible, just stupid.",2,16 February 2009,"I know, it's sappy and all that. I watched it on Valentinesday and if I could rewind time and do it all over again.. I'd rather cut my cats claws with my teeth. With Mr.Stoneface not faced by anything and the obnoxious bohemian chick is never a match made i heaven.Let me list the things that are just so unbelievable in this movie and what really would have happened. ¤ At the DMV, Sara coming in with her bags spilling stuff all over the floor: result: She would be asked to leave. ¤ Nelson asking her for the answer to no 9. result: She would not answer him, instead she would focus on her own test. ¤ Sara get called to the desk and they rip up her paper. result: She points a finger at Nelson saying HE CHEATED! Possably telling the entire class the answer to no. 9, giving the desk-guy the finger and then walk out. ¤ Sara sitting on Nelsons car. result: He'd have hissyfit and tell her to get off it. ¤ Nelson offering Sara a month pay. result: She'd take it! ¤ Sara showing up at his house. result: He'd call the police. (before or after talking to her) ¤ Sara asking him for a ride. result: He would give her cab money. ¤ Sara breaking in stealing dogs. result: He'd call the police.¤ Sara inviting him up/threatening him to come back. result: He'd tell her to f-off and drive away. (and possibly have to call the police the next morning) ¤ Sara asking him to move in. result: He'd tell her to f-off and drive away. ¤ Sara sending him a dog and a key. result: He sends the dog back (possibly alive) and call the cops.Now even if all this STILL would lead up to him ending up at her place for a night of sex... ¤ Sara giving away his clothes. result: He slaps her across the face and leave. ¤ Sara trying to introduce him to everyone on the block. result: ""Sara, I just don't give at sh*t."" ¤ Nelson leaving Saras place and going home, and get bored. result: He would download porn, watch some and go to sleep.Now, if all of these things still would result in him returning to her to live... ¤ Living together... result: No one have a job = no one pay rent.. And besides from sex, what do they have in common?? ¤ Sara telling him about all the guys she had. result: He'd leave. Make a doctors appointment and check for STDs. ¤ Sara taking him to the boat-race. result: He'd be on the phone. ¤ He pay the guy to help out, and having Sara telling him it was wrong. result: ""Fine, you stuck up b*itch. Is there anything I do that is 'good enough' for you? Who died and made you queen of everything?"" ¤ Sara being selfrightious about everything. result: He'd pack up and leave. ¤ Abner telling him to come to fathers day while Sara is just released from the hospital. result: He'd tell the kid to ask his mum who his real daddy is and go bother him. ¤ Nelson getting an interview with the Price. result: Price-less! He would never turn it down!When Sara finally tell him about the illness, he would pay the hospital bills out of guilt and when she tells him to leave he would. There is no chance in hell that these two people would have a future together even if she wasn't sick. They have nothing in common and the fact that he give up his life to marry her is just not possible. I feel sorry for Angelica wasting her time on him, and for his pet goldfish that no one fed for a month and died wondering what he did wrong.. in his aquarium with one lousy plant and no sand.This is by far one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. It get two stars because of the soundtrack and ... There was a cute pet in it. The rest just plain sucks.",Sweet November
49,vintkd,Sara Deever changed my life too!!!,10,9 June 2012,"I don't even remember how many times I have looked this lovely movie and every time I'm experiencing a huge delight and flight of my soul. Charlize Theron is incredibly beautiful woman and startling actress, just to look at her it's already great delectation. ""Sweet September"" is prettily story about love, about life and cost of its every moment. Someone will think this film too sad, someone too sweet, but for me it's very life-asserting and inspiring story after which you just ready to fall in love to any stranger on the street and it's inexpressible feeling. I have seen a lot of similar films, such as ""Autumn in New York"", ""Griffin & Phoenix"", ""The Notebook"" and others, but in my opinion ""Sweet September"" is the best. Sara Deever changed my life too!!!",Sweet November
50,anacpcruz,Not the Average Romantic Movie,7,8 November 2021,"In my perspective, Keanu Reeves was always a great actor and I think he portrayed the character of Nelson amazingly well. In the beginning he had that aggressive behavior typical of a workaholic, narcissist kind of high functioning psychopath in the competitive work world, and then, with a gradient, we see the character change and unfold, and the behavior changes day by day in that November. Although I respect other people's opinions and reviews, I think Keanu captured brilliantly those changes. Of course not of that was possible without the charisma of Charlize Theron character - Sara Deever. The unconventional, in the opposite side of the social spectrum woman, with Nelson think he has nothing in common.Besides the roller-coaster that Sara turn in Nelson life, there's other themes that are debated and exposed. Firstly, the concept of bulling and moral harassment. And, the most important, in my eyes, was the bring up the question of animal rights, specially the questions of domestic animal testing, the potential slaughter for consumption proposes. Overall, the consideration that domestic animal are not objects, but beings with feelings and rights, and that deserve all unconventional love and respect. Their great purety is that they recognize it and give back all the love they get. So, Sara character expose us the relevance of those themes, and most importantly - the necessity of bravery and courage and to rescue those innocent animals of those terrible living conditions, so, even worse - those threats to their own lives. So, I felt very apprehensive in the adoption by a Chinese man in a decrepit van, that don't even show any requirements of love, respect, tenderness, affection or the slightest interest in the innocent dog, threat him like an object or a pice of something. Luckily, that was on proposed in the script, and I was very happy with the overcome, and the rescue of Ernie.Overall, I will have this piece 7 stars out of 10 available.",Sweet November
51,ezoelmansouri-58306,IT COULD'VE BEEN BETTER !!,6,9 September 2020,"I think in my opinion that there's nothing wrong with the acting at all, both of Charlize and Keanu were amazing especially Charlize she was wonderful, but the writing and the script ruined it.. also i found that the ending was absolutely UNNECESSARY, people who loves the romantic and emotions scenes will love it, but for those who focusing more on the story will have some problem getting it.",Sweet November
52,reblit,Romantic Drama,5,18 April 2005,"Keanu Reaves portrays the handsome, driven and hot-headed ad-exec Nelson Moss very well. His performance falls apart in how he changes from this workaholic so quickly. Perhaps that has something to do with how time is portrayed in this film but the only problem he seemed to have is using his cell phone and looking at his watch, this seemed totally unbelievable to me. I would have expected to see a lot more resistance to the change and/or anger about Sara wanting to change him. Charlize Theron as Sara Deever is an unconventional young woman who has set out to change peoples' lives one-person one-month at a time. Theron is excellent is this movie. The movie is also slightly unbelievable in that these two very different young people got ""together"" so quickly in the first place. Not a classic to be watched over-and-over but it is a nice movie.",Sweet November
53,SFLYNNLV,Sweet Charlize,5,5 August 2001,"Charlize Theron is the only reason to sit through this epic of sentimentality.Charlize meets Keanu, the yuppie ad exec and insists that he give her a month - November - to change his lifestyle.  All well and good.  Story is interesting.  But, it is so difficult to get around Keanu's inability to act.  He always acts sincere.  It is like watching a two hour audition tape. Fortunutely, he has Charlize to prop him up.I harbor great hope that Keanu will drift into character and supporting roles where he can learn more of his craft.  However, he is no longer the Hollywood pretty boy and needs to lose some weight.  Reeves is not Brando.While the story is sentimental - it is to the point and the ending was interesting and moving.5/10 for story, art direction, supporting cast and Charlize Theron.  I can only imagine a Matt Damon, or a Charlie Sheen might have done with Keanu's part.",Sweet November
54,bsamdahl,Both Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron give good performances in Sweet November,8,11 February 2002,"I thought Sweet November was an above average romance movie.  A few qualifiers are in order here.  First, I never saw the original, second, I normally do not care for romantic movies, and third, I am a big fan of Keanu Reeves. The reviews are quick to call Nelson Moss a self absorbed work-aholic. The movie does bring out a little of Nelson's past explaining how he feared he would end up like his father and the rest of the neighbors on his block. Combine that with the high pressure in today's society to get ahead, and you can understand why Nelson is obsessed with work.  Sara is very original and entertaining and makes you wonder if she's all there or what is she up to.  After almost 90 minutes into the film, you will see why Sara is the way she is and maybe enjoy the movie.  Keanu does a good performance with Nelson, creating a believable image of a single focused Ad Executive.  One can see many women saying ""typical male,"" and many men thinking of Nelson as a typical best buddy. As is true with many things in life, Nelson goes from one extreme to the other. In the end, Sara becomes his single focus in life. Trying to find the middle road is a central theme in many of Keanu's movie roles. I liked the acting in this film. It wasn't too dramatic nor was it bland. It was right down the middle.",Sweet November
55,Ed in MO,One of the worst films I have ever seen,2,19 July 2001,"I had to sit through this film on a flight from Tokyo to Minneapolis. Several times during the film I wanted to open the cabin door and jump out of the airplane.  The movie was that bad.  Keanu Reeves is proof that so long as you are attractive, you don't need to be able to act in today's Hollywood.  He had the same expression on his face and the same tone in his voice at the beginning of the film, when he was a high-powered advertising executive, as he did at the end, when he turned into a wimpy unemployed puppy waving ""bye"" at the disappearing Charlize Theron. 
Why is it in every movie like this, where a women is dying, there has to be a gay friend in her life who takes care of all her hygenic needs?  I guess this is something that women fantasize about.  Here it was Jason Isaacs as the cross-dresser with a heart of gold.  This was truly a wretched movie.  I was curious to see if anyone could actually like this film and of course there were a few who did.  I guess it just goes to show that there is no accounting for taste.",Sweet November
56,tingnting,Caught me by surprise,6,14 June 2006,"This movie was on TV last night and it took me off guard. It's a brilliant roller-coaster of emotions. It made me think about life in a different way.Charlize Theron, although not the main character, steals the show. Her talent is prevalent but this makes Reeve's acting look even blander than usual. He is clearly out-classed as a thespian. They do look incredibly good together though and share an extraordinary on-screen chemistry. They haven't aged a bit since Devil's Advocate.This movie will leave you thinking about what really matters in life. You will cry but you will also laugh a lot. Everything that makes a film worth watching! Rent this movie if you're together with your partner or on a date. Don't rent it if you're in the mood for a comedy.",Sweet November
57,mohdshafiulhaque,Beautiful!!! Sweet!!!,9,27 September 2016,"One of the best on screen love story. Keanu and Charlize were both good in their parts. The story line-up was nice. The pace of the movie was also nice. The location set-up was all in place and it deserve a good rating. Charlize looks damn pretty as always. This movie will make you cry and you will fall for the movie without doubt. It is a must see for Charlize fans. Music soundtrack was good. Had few cheesy lines but overall the script was good. Oh, and since I used to be someone exactly like the Reeves character is the start of the movie, I can relate to what it is to discover that there is more to life. His character is real alright, but in the surreal sort of way that only those who have actually been there and escaped, truly understand. Now, if only I had had someone as charming as Ms. Theron to show me.",Sweet November
58,micattak,Hollywood movie without a real happy end? (7/10),7,22 June 2001,"I must admit, I like, both Charlize and Keanu a lot. They were very good in ""The Devils Advocat"". You can see that they both like to play with each other. The acting is very good. The end was somehow disappointing. It seems like Keanu's character really evolved thru-out the movie, but she stood still.About the plot. A workaholic, who hasn't even got time to do his DMV test (to prolong his drivers licence) gets entangled with Sara, a girl with a rather suspect life-style. After he gets fired and looses his girl-friend he moves in with here. She normally stays with guys for no more than a month, and she tells him that upfront. But she didn't calculate on falling in love...
I give it a 7/10",Sweet November
59,lndc98,"Irritating, but with one lovely scene.",1,15 July 2001,"I did not like this film.  I am mainly irritated by two things.  First, Keanu R. always sounds so inept, so wooden.  I've seen amateur theatre that has better acting.  I don't understand how he's gotten so far in the movie business.  Plus he has some lines in this film that had me writhing because they are so trite.  Second, I was not convinced by Sara's unwillingness to try to get better.  I did not understand it and I did not get any insight into her motivations.Now, having said the foregoing, the last scene is a beauty.  It has tension and suspense.  But it is not enough to give this film weight.  It is just a gesture or flourish.",Sweet November
60,ACME_Horses,It could happen to you...not!,3,23 October 2004,"The whole premise is too far fetched. And Reeves and Theron have no chemistry together. Beautiful girl meets beautiful guy and goes out of her way to ""help"" him. Like she would have nothing better to do. We're supposed to believe she's really insightful and giving. And he's this awesome who guy is super successful and talented. Yes he's able to put together a ridiculous ad campaign...as opposed to just quiting his job and doing something he likes better.There's no real story here. It's just not very interesting. The guy is rich and good looking and he's a work-a-holic so his personal life sucks. Gee, there's an original plot. If you're a fan of the characters...or if you're bored on a Sunday afternoon, then maybe check this out. If not, skip it, read a book.",Sweet November
61,lmabadie,Cheesy and absurd plot,3,25 December 2017,"The plot in the movie does not make any sense. Why would Sara fall for somebody like Nelson to the point to want to expend her last time in this world with him? Her character clearly did not care much about looks.... and Nelson had not done anything special until they met for her to become so interested on him. Why would she be so insistent to the point of finding his address (and getting there without being able to drive) and FORCING him to give her a ride? Don't they have taxis in San Francisco? And didn't she have many other friends after all if she needed a favor? Anyway, no matter how much a workaholic a man is, not very credible that Nelson has to be FORCED give somebody as beautiful as Charlize a ride and then needs to be FORCED to go up in her apartment ""for a cup of tea"" (or whatever it was) ....that ended in sex. So, the plot really killed it, the beginning looked promising, but the last part of the movie (when Sara's motives are ""explained"") killed for me, and was boooring.",Sweet November
62,hirotohirotogackt,Warm and sorrowful!,8,8 August 2017,"This film is warm and sorrowful. I do not see much love story but, the lead that I watched this movie was that my favorite actor, Keanu Reeves, played the main character. However, as I watched it actually, it fixed my attention and I have watched it many times.The charming point in this film is that the relation between Sara Deever and Nelson Moss is not usual. They do not know each other. Especially, Sara unexpectedly appears at Nelson. Who is she? Nelson never knows and mistrust her at first, but he is gradually attracted to the woman yet she has a secret. Although Sara appears to be Nelson's girlfriend for a few time, she notices she has truly loved him. Then she decides to go away him because of her being reluctant to show her weakness him. There are pros and cons in her thought, but I disagree with it. She is selfish. Love can overcome some plights. Love can lead our good ways to live. I think so. Also, the soundtrack improves the quality of this movie. The music fits in it. It doubles the impression of the audience. Though I cannot agree with Sara's behavior, I like this film as one work.",Sweet November
63,po5mrk,"Bittersweet, it had its moments.",7,16 February 2001,"Sweet November is a romance, plain and simple, but with a twist.  Romance in a bizarre scenario makes for an interesting, if not bittersweet movie.  Of course, the romance aspect was well, romantic, but the story was a little far fetched.  Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves had little authentic chemistry, but both are such wonderful actors, that they faked it well. All in all, the movie had it's great moments, sad, funny and sweet, but the story can cloud them up a bit.",Sweet November
64,danielkeough,Wonderful movie,9,14 April 2007,"This is a wonderful movie because it is just real. Real people have things they are dealing with and are not always making their best choices--Nelson decides to come back a couple times. I really enjoy the effort of Sara to shine a light so Nelson can see simple pleasures in life, pleasures looked over when someone is so focused on getting an account and working long hours.I love this movie, own it, and have watched it several times. I find it rather coincidental that my refusal to watch, turning off the movie right before the end (on the morning of December 1) to remember the beauty of the movie--is the same action that Sara takes to remember the change in Nelson and the beauty of their loving relationship, right before the end.Sweet November is a fabulous movie. I hope the film reminds you to slow down and take a look at the important things in your life when you view it again.",Sweet November
65,leereed2009,A Sweet November It Was,8,17 June 2009,"Anyone who saw this movie and thought is was boring or corny, simply don't get the wonderful subtle elements within it. It was made to show how someone, completely devoid of sentiment can learn to love and appreciate the smaller and sweeter things of life. Everyone falls in love with Sara Deever (Theron) because all of us have some Nelson (Reeves) in us. We all wish and hope to be as youthful and loving as Sara. This movie is sad, but also a feel-good movie. It leaves wanting to appreciate life a little more. To quote the film, ""It doesn't get much sweeter than this"". This movie had all the elements of a great film. Great actors, message, and story. Just give it a chance and maybe you will get a second chance at life.",Sweet November
66,woodfrtillson,Stop to Smell the Roses,8,12 April 2002,"You would think since we use one third of our lives to sleep, one month of searching our souls would be easy to do.  Nelson proves just how hard it is to get away from the ritual of doing, without really living.  Sarah introduces him to the pleasures of walking in the sand barefooted, helping others and seeing the end in an all too clear perspective.  Let this movie be your guide into the pleasures of awakening that part of us that goes into a deep sleep as we wander the path of life.  In a search, you can only find what your looking for.",Sweet November
67,sempergumby,Biggest Waste of Time,1,15 August 2002,"Unlike many other movies made by the stars of this film, this was a complete waste of time.  The idea for the movie may have had some redeeming value before it was completely decimated in execution.  This is another disappointing film where you keep thinking it has to get better, and yet it never does.Sorry, to those who are fans, this is not even a good chick flick.If you want a good chick flick, go see Emma or better yet Princess Bride.",Sweet November
68,kathy5353853,Well...,6,15 October 2003,"OK, so with all the many, many comments already here, why bother to write? I just got done watching it for the first time, and remembering the 1968 original with Sandy Dennis, I thought I would check out some things on the IMDb. I am very mixed in my reaction to the remake. I actually thought that Reeves did one of his better jobs here. I like to watch him in the movies. I don't think he is the greatest actor around, but I think that he improved by miles after being directed by Al Pacino in DEVIL'S ADVOCATE (also opposite Theron, by the way). But I can not review this version without comparison to the original film version. In 1968 a lot of the general population was just trying to get used to people openly living together at all. So this lifestyle of Sara's really did put a different spin on an otherwise, sort of, normalish, kind of woman. But for her to be taking in a different man for every month made her definitely not ""normal"". The word used most often by the commenters of the '68 film was ""quirky"". That simply does not apply to the Sara of Charlize Theron's era. Live together, don't live together, come and go, and especially in a liberal neighborhood of San Francisco, and OK, so who is going to notice besides the little boy across the street. So, did Charlie('68)/Nelson('01') need some changing in their ""boring"" unfulfilled lives? Well, according to many, ""yes"", but according to the way our society works these days, if that kind of work and business is your choice, than it IS necessary or you don't have a job. But, OK, we will accept that premise, and on we go. My question is this: Does the perspective that Sara lives under really hold up in true life? Is it a valid and honest thing to do with the end of your days, to show people with holes in their characters, that life is full and wonderful and everyone should ""stop to smell the roses"". Make it sound altruistic as a better way to live up to the end, than continuing with chemos that she has already been through, and likely would not work at all this time  around. But then to push those that do love you away? And she loved her family and Charlie/Nelson too, but just wanted to be remembered as full of life! Is this not egotistical in the extreme?!? Is this not major fear of that inescapably absolute part of life, which is death?? Does this attitude and behavior in either film not belie every single thing she has chosen to do and live by, every time she takes and takes and takes again,  love from strangers for the REAL purpose of being remembered? I think that the very fabric and premise of the whole story is that of a woman NOT quirky, NOT brave and strong, NOT just wanting to live simply and give of herself. THAT is what I think is the major flaw of this story both times around.",Sweet November
69,ghajiniblue,Excellent movie,10,6 November 2009,"What can I say? it's one of my favorite movies. It has everything: love, romance, action, sorrow, and happiness. hero & heroine of this film have wonderful chemistry together, and it shows. It makes you feel like you want to become a better person, and not be so selfish, self-centered, and makes you realize that there more important things in life.This movie is so indescribable and unique.I have seen it many times. I will admit that I am a hopeless romantic and I love to watch these types of movies.I think that it is so romantic and so beautiful and i think that the movie was made very well",Sweet November
70,TheCooperVane,One BAD movie.,1,12 October 2001,"I really don't have much to say that hasn't already been said.  I will only take a moment to mention that people who like this film must fall into one of a select number of categories: - never seen a ""romantic comedy"" before this one. - is incurably sappy and thus willing to overlook the cliches that define this ""movie."" - enjoys it on a meta-level; out of some categorization interest or (alternatively) its satirical nature.I'm not a big ""romantic comedy"" person, but I feel confident in saying that if you're moved by this movie, you'll be moved by ANYTHING.  Sleepless in Seattle this isn't.  It isn't even Jerry Maguire.Pause this film at any of the 'plot points' and you can easily and accurately predict what will come next (I first noticed this when SPOILER Keanu got fired.  I thought ""now his girlfriend will dump him."" and voila! she did END SPOILER).On top of that, this film relies on contrivance.  Tell me, if you were Keanu's character in this movie, wouldn't you have called the cops at some point?  I know if I were a high powered, well-to-do businessperson with the kind of drive that they (vaguely) assign the character, any person who does what Charlie's character does would arouse suspicion (and a call to the cops for stalking, felonious theft, or any of a miriad of other things).Those of you with common sense... avoid this movie unless you're looking for another reason to get depressed at our national gullibility.",Sweet November
71,somnorosu2002,Challenges people to live more.,8,20 August 2008,"When i first heard about this movie many years ago, i thought to myself this is the kind of mushy romantic movie that mostly women and young girls like to watch while eating ice-cream and sobbing. I was proved wrong when i finally saw it.It is much more than a love story, it is a movie that actually challenges you on an emotional and psychological level. It makes you think about the phrase ""Not being dead doesn't mean you are alive"". Even though the acting is not at it's peak, Keanu and Charlize manage to impress by the pure emotion they seem to feel throughout the film.""Sweet November"" actually made me, at least for a while, to try and be more alive than usual.",Sweet November
72,veenusav,good romance. good ending. good course for 'professionals' from 'life'.,7,30 June 2015,"Yes the movie discusses somewhat 'normal' story-line. But the presentation made it different. Kudos to the director, editor and the actors. It shares situations like a fairy tale.surely romance is the only thing that you can make you unreal. eyes talk a lot. even the pets have a role to prove the existence of love. illogical world of love is there always. at some point the character has to ask ""have you been in sales?"". what a dodging which is normally cannot be fit in romancing movies. but factually it is always there in real romance. power of eyes. what else.Being a pro, those 'professional values' to 'life values' made me to think. Time, dollar all have been touched nicely. even the way things are being presented in career are nicely portrayed. And how badly a professional confidence is disproved. there comes the different dimensions of pro and love. Love which is not mixed with $ or time can have a lot of confidence There are points which will make your eyes wet. its okay. life values are worth for a cry. there could have more connects with his childhood stories. may be then he can find himself in more natural way. also the obvious skin tone changes must have made more gradual. am i missed it? is that really great? !! anyway I think the dark circles could have lighten. slow means more natural.So briefly, good romance. good ending. good course for 'professionals' from 'life'. Kudos to the creators",Sweet November
73,Commoner,Copy Cat?,7,14 January 2007,"I gave this a vote of 7 only because of Charlize Theron. She's a good actor and looks good on the screen. Reeves played Reeves. He was the same character as all his other movies.I was a little troubled and puzzled. I've seen a movie called ""Autuum in New York. Seems unusual to have two very similarly plotted movies so chronologically close together. I was troubled because I kept comparing the two movies as I watched.I was entertained by both movies. I liked Autuum in New York better though. Richard Gere seems so much more a varietal actor. I liked Theron more than Winona Ryder. Did Theron lose weight for this movie?",Sweet November
74,Miroslav-A,Nothing is what it seems,7,10 July 2021,"I interrupted my first watching of this movie after ~ 30 min. It's a common case with decent number of movies when I find myself bored within first half. When that happens, I'm leaving it for some time till patience serves me better.After a long period of time, I turned it back on, with the intention of 'stymiing' him as an example that Reeves could also take part in a scenario where his acting could practically be described as boring. Plus C. Theron next to him, whose movies I can count on very few, that I really liked them.Rarely, but still can happen to get completely surprised (positively) by second warching.The story is still relatively unconvincing - a wacky girl chooses boys to spend a month in a relationship with them, thereby changing their lives for the better.The month of November happens to get a young workaholic, 24/7 dedicated and extremely successful in his work, but emotionally 'dead'.This deficiency was noted by our 'fairy godmother' and after an accidental encounter decided to dedicate the current month to him. She succeeds in persuading him to move in with her, and to give her a chance to prove her positive impact on unhappy people.A perfectly logical outcome - expectations equal to zero, shutting down the film, looking for something more interesting?In the second half, however, the plot gains a different genre and weight. I'm not going to write about the same thing, so as not to spoil the experience to someone who after a relatively dull first half doesn't turn off the movie (like me). I'll just leave a comment- worth a look.The other thing was interesting to me, so I'm going to take this opportunity to briefly compare it to another Reeves drama, which very likely won't get its own review.'The Lake House' that I looked at right after this headline, from which I had certain expectations by reading a number of positive comments, as well as with very likeable (to me) Sandra Bullock next to K. Reeves...But the truth is, it left me completely indifferent. And when we look at the facts - much more charisma, especially from female protagonists; As crazy as the character that interprets C. Theron seems, there is much more energy, unusual (interesting) situations, as well as 'chemistry' between the main characters.Conclusion (better to say advice) : expectations to set aside (my chronic error no.1), because apparently the movie trailer and short descriptions of the film often create the wrong picture.For more movie reviews, visit my blog :

75,BenAordure,Not perfect but great,8,5 August 2010,"Nelson (Keenu Reeves) encounters Sara (Charlize Theron), a lunatic freak but generous and full life-living woman who surprisingly proposes him to help to improve his life by coaching him during a whole month ! Nelson eventually accepts the proposal and happens to feel love. But Sara has predictably got a secret ... Believe me, the end is sad, sad but beautiful, the kind of ending that can make you burst into tears !The scenario has got some imperfections. For example Keanu Reeves acts a closed-minded advertising manager, while this profession needs openmindness and creativity. I also want to be explained why Sara running from Protero Hill suddenly appears to Dolores Park in seconds ! :-) Also the ropes of the regular romance are all present (the public declaration, the perfect and minority-member friend, the little pet, the missing-father child, etc ..). So we could have feared something rebarbative. Happily this film must not be watched as a simple romance. Despite those weird elements, the film has value. The very purpose of the film is about the life value. And the film treats it well.Sara seems to be a freak, but she's not. And we learn from her. As she has only few moments left to live, she focuses on the most important things : savouring truly each moment of life. It's that simple. Sara's way to live, her choices, her complete devotion to others, even selfish jerks like Nelson, her truth, her rejection of money, ego, and work-devotion, make us realise that most part of our life is time-wasting and that relationships are about trusting, about making a free of charge step forward.We also learn from the relation with time : Nelson had not enough time for love, no time for family in law, no time to spare if a career opportunity occurs... while Sara spares time for making love, for playing with dogs, for the coaching, and think about the right time for making up with family (so do her friends). The film reveals us that doing plenty of things is not living fully and that the most precious gift we can share is no money but time. Sharing time with others, this is the point.And I like Sara's choice at the end. The need of Sara to be loved forever. This gives all the power to the film. As she says, memories are all we have. Don't we ? After all, isn't it the one thing even naked we carry everywhere ?Regarding the acting, Charlize Theron is really touching in the whole movie. And despite Keanu Reeves has a incoherent task as I said, he manages well to pass gradually from a controled and selfish behaviour to a receiving and open one. The soundtracks well follow the storyboard and we can enjoy some good views of the San Francisco bay (a fantastic city by the way).Just for those reasons the film would be worth a watch. I watched this film many times, and I definitely do not understand the general misloving of this film. I hope my review will makes you give it a try !",Sweet November

77,gedachtniskirche,The filthiest love-story,4,9 July 2013,"Hollywood with some special perverted love savors the snotty and tearful melodramatic plots, where the suffering an incurable illness hero/heroine is given the place of honor for. Directors in the different ways, with the most compassionate and touching paints present us the sufferings and uncontrollable regrets of fateful luckless persons, spice a plot with romanticism of all shades of pink, for more tragedy. We sincerely empathize and sympathize with their disasters, we rejoice and inspired with their will to live and we condemn, when they enervated obey the fate, reveling in their misery.But the heroine of «Sweet November» - an extraordinary and eccentric personality. Cultivation the victim of fate's injustice in herself – is not her inheritance. She invented her original way to paint with all the colors of the rainbow her remaining days. Sara Deever – is a daffy, wild young woman, prone to every kind of eccentricities. Beautiful, young, kind and energetic. But, alas, Sara has an incurable disease, and her days are inexorably beginning to wane. So why not to arrange the dying fairy show for herself? And Sara decides to have some fun in the end. She chooses fancy males virtually from the crowd, swoops on them, like a shattering tornado, knocks the poor guys down with one kick of her charm and sudden onslaught, after that she takes root into their life with imperturbable and pushy impudence, overturning upside down the usual orders and already existing vital ways. Sara sees exceptionally noble altruism and sincerely desire to fill a life of her next chosen with new, true significance in her action. Having tightly locked a door in the habitual life, Sara's chosen gets her as a kind of a gift. The deal is valid for a month. After the lapse of which brazen altruist Sara coolly turns her confused and love with her boyfriend out of the door, because the next candidate who dreams to quit his adjusted life for the sake of shady and ambiguous adventure, looms over the threshold. Such fate was prepared also to Nelson Moss, the character of Keanu Reeves. Nelson - the young and ambitious careerist living only by work. Discouraged by Sara's so gusty and extravagant impudence, Nelson all the forces resists to her invasion into his adjusted and vigorous life. Her delusional conditions, doubtful and alluring promises are not laid into the head of a pragmatic and self-assured young man by no means. Gradually, still continuing to go reflexively obstinate, Nelson does not notice as falls in love with this foolish, but such charming eccentric woman. Sara's plan, well developed by months, fails: Nelson casually discovers her illness. The tragic and romantic ending approaches. Sara can hypocrite to herself and others as much as necessary long, sincerely considering, that her lifestyle is a saving mission. Justifying her brazen interference in life of other people with desire to open them eyes on all its delights, to teach to enjoy all its displays, having removed from monotony and idleness routine, Sara, like a complete egoist, simply treacherously breaks in others lives, destroying the colorless and steady rhythm. Having been satiated properly with the next boyfriend, irrevocably making the poor guy to love yourself, she ruthlessly throws him out as the used discarded material. And she wanted to spit on the following sufferings and distress of her guinea-pigs. According to Sara, disease provides her with undeniable advantage, that gives her the right to play with human feelings and lives, to using any opportunities and circumstances to catch convulsively up for the missed pleasures of life.The nasty story. Even the considerable quantity of various romantic ""pieces"" and casting of my favorite Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron couldn't sweeten the sickening sediment. That's a distorted understanding of love and romance.",Sweet November

Honestly, this is one of the greatest movies I've ever watched. It's not just some sappy love story. It's a story about learning to live, the little things that give our lives meaning. And it gives us a good look at a very touchy subject, that being terminal illness and how those facing it as well as how their loved ones deal with death, which is just as important as how we face life. Now, I'm not one that cries at movies. There are very few that can bring a few tears to my eyes. ""Sweet November"" had me literally SOBBING uncontrollably for the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. I still cry and I've seen it more than a dozen times. Never in my life have I seen a movie so moving. It caught me off guard. I can't give props to any of the actors specifically as they all did a phenomenal job telling this tale. I've never found Keanu Reeves as being the type of actor to play emotional roles, he normally seems a bit stoic and those are the roles that best suit him. But I have to say, he surprised me in this movie. It's a must see!",Sweet November

Its just... too bad of a plot to digest... Talk about improbable!
The acting and the ridiculous plot make a seemwhat easy romantic theme (workaholic man meets crazy fun woman) feel embarrassing! I mean.. they go LIVE togheter? Out of the blue? She proposes a month internship at her place?

Oh, if only that were it.Here's what the trailer didn't tell you. She's dying. Of a treatable disease (come on, we all watched Party of Five). Why? Because she's so much of a free spirit that she'd rather ""enjoy the time she has."" It's no wonder ad boy Keanu never saw it coming. Just days earlier Charlize was doing cartwheels on the beach. All of a sudden, she's got a medicine cabinet to rival any hospital's.I like romantic movies. But nothing could make me sit through this one again.

84,CPAScott,"Why can't Americans accept anything but ""Happily Ever After""?",6,18 April 2002,"Based on the number of comments that complain about the ending, I'm convinced my point is proven -- Americans want nothing more from a film than raw entertainment with happy endings -- breaks from reality though they may be.Hey, it's ok for a move to be nothing more tha mindless entertainment, and it's ok to want to watch a movie that leaves you happy at the end.  But not all films are meant to be that way -- and not all should.When I was a kid I thought the best ending to a movie I ever saw was from 1982's ""Last American Virgin"" where believe it or not, the guy DIDN'T get the girl.  Ya know what folks?  It happens in life sometimes.**SPOILER AHEAD** The ending of this movie worked perfectly for me -- a bittersweet end to a tear jerker of a film.  Gripe about Keanu's acting if you want or the plot in general, but if you're rating this movie poorly simply 'cause the ending wasn't a happy one, then you're handing out less credit than you should be. I mean, what are you people looking for?  I know, you wanted them to find some miracle cure so that Charlize and Keanu could live ""happily ever after"", right?

Now, after watching it a third time and listening to your comments, I have revised my rating to a whopping 6 out of 10.  I will not repeat much here but did anyone else notice that when Reeves drove up to Sara's digs in the Mercedes and turned the ignition off and doused the lights that one fog light remained lit -- very weird!Basically, I love Theron -- like someone else said, I would have a hard time saying no to any request she made but then again, I am not Nelson, the hard driven ad exec - come on, this movie is out in left field.  Reeves is bad, but I thought he was not terrible - he did try hard.  The plot was just too much Hollywood crap for me but I did like the originality, I loved sound track, and since I live near SF, I loved the location.  The ending was made on MARS, I think.  Anyways, all summed, that is why I gave it the 6.",Sweet November

92,cerasea,A Bitter Pill,1,15 December 2003,"I could have forgiven a lot about this film. I always try to respect a movie's genre. This was a romantic comedy/fantasy so I wasn't expecting Kramer vs. Kramer. I could accept the melodramatic premise (beautiful dying girl falls in love with/tries to ""save"" handsome self-involved young man from himself) but most of the movie just didn't sit well with me. When trying to gather my overall impression, my mind can't help but ""bring up"" the scene where Sara is vomiting on the floor of her bedroom.I really don't think I was asking for much. Instead, I think the movie demanded too much. Suspending my disbelief was a fair requirement. I actually consider it part of the fun. However all the fun began to vanish when the movie decided to take itself more seriously than it had the right to. At this point, its demands became disturbing and somewhat devious.(As noted by other reviewers) The movie shamelessly plugged every cliché ever recorded on celluloid: rain-soaked confrontations, public declarations, cute animals, needy children, convenient diseases, gay/minority best friends with a heart of gold - but no real life of their own, and BAD SINGING! Yet the movie still felt that it could (and SHOULD) present itself as a somber tribute to the pain of life and love. The repeated and ridiculously heavy-handed diatribes about Sara's trying to, ""control her uncontrollable circumstances"" and, ""die with dignity"" seemed as if they were beamed in to give all the preceding romantic fluffiness weight. I have no problem with those arguments, but they belonged in another movie and appeared extremely contrived. Dying young is perhaps the ultimate example of life's unfairness, but to try to make a movie that is both eye candy and reality tale is almost as unfair.",Sweet November
93,guidecca,Great Movie - A Primer on Love Lost,10,27 July 2002,Every true love should be immortalized like this one.  Couldn't find a better movie to express the pain of love.  Love does not need rationality or perfection - it is perfection.  The movie really defies review - if you can watch it without crying...you've never lost true love and it is not a movie you could possibly appreciate.  Some movies do not require great acting or music...the story carries you away.  To me the acting and music were great and I howled in grief.  It will be a cult film for lovers.,Sweet November
94,how-64844,The story is a little far-fetched,3,7 June 2018,"Plot-wise it's already a little dumb. So this girl ""helps"" guys every month by sleeping with them and making them fall in love? All because she's dying? What help is that supposed to do? She squeezes herself into one's life, tries to change it in drastic ways, and then when he falls in love she drops the bomb? I think that's selfish. Nelson's transition from being all ""get away from me"" to ""I wanna be with you forever"" felt all too sudden and unrealistic. Also, the fact that he gave up a big opportunity for a girl he just met is crazy! Hey, love isn't gonna feed you. Wasn't he fired already? So he actually kinda swallowed his pride and tried to suck it up to get a meeting with this big guy and he just throws it away for what? Because Mr. Big guy got pissed and he politely told the waitress how he felt? And that waitress crying where the customers can see? That's weird and unprofessional unless, well, she's asking for attention and I won't feel bad for that.Another weird thing is if Sarah stopped chemo over a year ago and her cancer's in a late stage, she would have more physical symptoms that Nelson would have noticed and questioned. They were together 24/7! Keanu's acting was not that good. When he's not talking he looks alright.I don't like the movie overall but I'm not giving it a 1/10 because the ending scene was actually quite cute. It's got me a bit of goosebumps going on. Too bad the story didn't build up so well.",Sweet November
95,Clare-5,Living Life on your own terms,7,17 February 2001,"This is a bittersweet romance.  Sara knows she is dying, but instead of giving up, she wants to have as many experiences she can.

She doesn't want to be anyone's sad story.When she falls in love with Nelson, she is forced to choose between the world she has built for herself and the one she has always feared.  She chooses to do what is best for her.  She lives life on her own terms.  She refuses to let her impending death rule whatever life she has left. 
As much as you want her to let Nelson take care of her, you know that she can't let him.  Sara has to let Nelson go in order to focus on life.

The storyline is magnificent, albeit a tad old-fashioned, which is OK when you consider that it's a remake of a 1968 movie. The one to watch in this movie is Charlize Theron. The movie is all about her character, Sarah Deever, and she really lives up to it with acting that blows away all else, even Keanu Reeves' efforts. And who expected Jason Isaac to fit in a his role so well? All in all, this is a must-watch. The soundtracks are added bonus, with 'wherever you are' and 'only time' requiring special mention.

Nelson Moss(Reeves) is stuck in his work, when he meets Sara Deiver(Theron) and she offers to help him.  This movie was a very entertaining throughout.  It was a welcome change from some of the latest ""love stories"" i have seen(Save the Last Dance).  I absolutely loved this film, it shows us that we need to appreciate life and that we should not put to much importance on trivial things.  Reeves acting leaves something to be desired, but he has come a long way since Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and the story more than makes up for him.  Theron gives a great performance and being still in her mid 20's the best is yet to come.  This movie gets a 7 out of 10 from me.",Sweet November

113,Editor_Mandy,Good Actors Bad Beginnings...,2,4 November 2009,"I don't feel Keanu is a bad actor. I felt the actors and actresses in the movie did a good job for what they were given. I do feel the story was poorly done. The way he is ""convinced"" to stay with a crazy acting woman who he doesn't know in the beginning just didn't work. I shook my head every time he agreed. It was extremely awkward and unreasonable. She constantly claimed it was to help him but there was no reasoning given. He wasn't really fired (called boss the next day and continued). His life wasn't spiraling out of control. There just wasn't a good enough reason to stay with a crazy stranger for a month. They needed to make Nelson's like a little more shaken.It especially got bad when they added the ""guy from downstairs"" the night after she sleeps with Nelson. She treats the neighbor like a boyfriend in front of Nelson (stupid) then is surprised (more stupid) when he runs off like any sane person would.If they had worked what I have explained above I would have given it a higher rating but the other half of the movie had it's own problems...She gets this guy into her home after much harassing, begging and prodding that he do so for a MONTH. She sleeps with him and gets involved with him knowing full well she is terminally ill. Yet she freaks out him, beating him up and throwing medications like a rabid monkey when he finds out. This makes absolutely no sense at all. Even if she felt that he would leave her before he found out, SHE HAS CANCER. They shouldn't have given her something so drastic. Terminal cancer is way too big to be hidden.So the guy finds out the woman who forced herself into his life has been lying and will die. Yet she refuses to treat him like a human being EVEN WHEN HE PROVES HE WANTS TO STICK AROUND AFTER FINDING OUT SHE IS SICK. This again is stupid.I think the story line had good points to it but there was too many unrealistic and bad things that ruined it. Usually when someone dies at the end of a movie I cry no matter how powerful the story had been. I didn't this time.Again I think the actors and actresses did a good job with the story they were given. The acting is the only reason it got a rating at all. The story was bad.",Sweet November

O.k., so this may have been a bit of brain candy, but I REALLY enjoyed it. The film was entertaining, full of characters I could care about, and Jason Isaacs as  Chaz was worth the price of the DVD. He is (in my biased opinion) always magnificent. This was the first film I've seen Charlize Theron in where I appreciated her as more than  just a pretty face,  and Keanu is always pretty to look at even when he isn't giving his  best; I thought he was quite good here (not meaning to sound patronising there!), btw. Michael Rosenbaum as Brandon/Brandy was unrecognisable from his Lex Luthor in  ""Smallville"" - how versatile is he?

116,winningsteven,Not That Good Love Story,6,12 March 2012,"The act of Keanu (Nelson) was good, not great . But, I think Charlize Theron really made the character of Sara alive in this movie. The cinematography was nicely done. But i really quite disagree with the story itself. How come you appreciate life if you don't fight for it as Sara did? I think what she's done is a submission to her disease. Then, the way Nelson change his own character is debatable. For a guy who considered that his job is his life, it was so illogical for him to turned down the biggest job offer at his life. C'mon, He only met Sara for less than a month. No one can change so rapidly like that.Nevertheless, don't watch this movie if you are a good-ending movies lovers.

I can't say that this was a masterpiece set to score at least 7 Oscars, but it is surely one moving story, deeply human and touchy. And so truthful. ...It definitely made me re-consider do I want to continue with my life the same way I did... (or anybody of us)...

118,creativevivian,Sugarcoated...with brown sugar and white sugar and pink sugar and teal sugar and violet sugar,10,5 October 2014,"After browsing through critic reviews, and seeing the low 6.6/10 stars at first glance, I was starting to think this movie would be a failure and that Keanu Reeves might disappoint me for the first time after all the amazing movies I've seen of his.This movie is one I watched along with many other heartfelt romance movies (you know, the kind that ties your heart into knots and all you can do is cry and suck your thumb), them being A Walk to Remember (2002), The Lake House (2006), The Fault in Our Stars (2014), and of course, Sweet November (2001), with Sweet November topping the list.I've got to admit, the beginning was a little funky and not exactly promising, but it gets warmer and warmer just like the colors of the leaves in November. Keanu once again gets together with Charlize after their previous project Devil's Advocate (1997) and play a lovely couple. The smooth transition, yet maintaining its' eccentric, staccato, little surprises of the main character Nelson, a fatherly, manly, and full of potential character, teaches the valuable lesson also taught in other romance films. The lesson and art of being able to wait, and being able to let go. Every type of romance film in this area expresses it differently, this was a full on bittersweet tale with two lovers, both with great character and very diverse personalities (hey, opposites attract)I was drowning in tears like I've never drowned before (well I haven't, but... yeah) because Keanu is born with the natural gift of portraying a loving gentleman, with many different variations of course, but this film is when he uses his gift to its extremity.The beauty and romance of this film is truly unbearable. Be sure to have a mountain of tissues... maybe an 5 inches smaller than Mt. Everest height. It ties your heart into knots, and teaches you lessons that have never occurred to you before, and shows you how much you really care about things you never thought of as cared for before.",Sweet November

Else, this attempt at making a movie fails.

I didn't like the way the movie ended, but I think that there are too many happy endings.I have to admit that Charlize Theron was one of the things that attracted me to the movie, but I didn't like Keanu Reeves. His acting stayed the same, and his acting was almost the same as in the matrix, which is not very good for a romantic dramatic movie.

132,narniac,Typical with a slight twist,8,23 April 2006,"This movie contains a typical performance by Keanu Reeves and a really good performance by Charlize Theron. The story it depicts seems at first like the run-of-the mill romantic comedy, but an air of mystery and a cloud of charm hover around Theron's character, keeping you intrigued. You quickly realize that this is not ordinary. Sara (Theron)loses an opportunity to renew her driver's license and Nelson (Reeves) is to blame. How she collects on the debt he owes is only the beginning of the fun. You will want to see how Nelson and Sara change each other during one ""Sweet November.""

There's Keanu, the business man, straight, cruel, cold-blooded, very successful in what he's doing but -of course- very bad in enjoying a ""real life"". Very bad at developing senses. Then, there's Charlize, who's the exact opposite. She knows everything about how to enjoy life, seize the day, 100% all the time. And -also of course- she's able to read Keanu's mind in no time, knows about his miserable ""back-stage"" life. Charlize meets Keanu and offers him to live with him! Why? Because she wants to help him. Keanu accepts and -surprise- the two fall in love. Don't worry, movie lover, I won't reveal the entire storyline although it is very predictable anyway.Concisely, -I think you could already feel the sarcastic touch- it's a bad movie and IMDb's average 5.6 really surprised me. I voted 4 out of ten. Only because Charlize manages again to deliver a solid performance as Sarah. She's a fine actress but has to fight the battle on her own since the storyline of ""Sweet November"" and especially Keanu Reeves as Nelson are far away from being convincing.",Sweet November

Everybody who lost a close person due to an illness eg, will probably agree.

Excellent scenes that tugged me to 'feel' now - as opposed to later. Emotions of disgust, pure joy, and compassion were struck. The script, the acting, combined with recent family health scares allowed this film to personally speak to me. It is a testimony to how brief encounters can impact one's direction in life. Consider striking up a conversation with someone at DMV ~ Was it a divine appointment taken seriously? Did it take courage to LIVE every day as if it were your last?

148,su_blimo,So unrealistic,2,28 November 2006,"This comment contains spoilers!I saw this movie last night and didn't like anything about it. The whole plot and the characters are totally unrealistic. At the beginning of the movie, Sara seems to be a complete lunatic. A workaholic like Keanu's Character would just have called the police if she was bothering him, and wouldn't have wasted time on her. In fact, in the beginning of the movie, he seems to realize that she acts like a crazy women. But all of a sudden, because he lost his job and his girlfriend left him, he seems to think: 'oh well, free sex', and decides to stay with her??? So he gives her a day. They take a walk at the beach, help a kid win a boatrace, and all of a sudden he realizes that this was the most spectacular day of his life?? Come on. This must have been the most boring way I saw two people falling in love spend a day together in a movie.So he decides to stay with her (although i have no idea why), and falls in love with her. There is absolutely no chemistry between the two, so I couldn't understand why the hell a workaholic like him would fall for a crazy person like her. And it all happens too fast. One minute, he thinks she is a lunatic, and the next minute he would leave everything behind for her. Damn, this guy is easy to convince.Keanu acts like a piece of cardboard, like always. Charlize tries hard to create some chemistry between them, but it must be an impossible job with an actor like Keanu.The part of the kid in the movie adds to the surrealism. At first I thought: 'where does this kid live??', until he ran off to tell his mother that Keanu's character will join him on father's day to his school. She must be an alcoholic or a drug addict to agree with that.Sara is dying of cancer. However, she invites an unknown man to stay with her for a month, knowing that he is falling in love with her. But when she gets really ill, she kicks him out. Nice personality.And in the end, Keanu even performs a Mary Poppins act, when he magically gets a dishwasher out of his Christmas bag.Bad story, bad characters, bad acting: bad movie.",Sweet November

This IS in fact the sorriest movie I've seen to date and Sarah is probably the meanest b*tch on this earth. Keanu? - why didn't you just leave after the first night with her. Any decent guy with just a little bit of self respect would have done that. Wanna see Keanu perform? Go watch Speed or something. I hope this sorry movie will continue to be the worst I've seen. If I ever experience a movie similar to this I promise I will start watching Indian made movies over American. I mean it. Don't watch it and in case you do. When you feel the urge to press STOP on your remote - after 5 - 10 minutes. Do.. I didn't. And I'm sorry! - If you can find ""The Wraith"" - watch that instead. Just a tip.",Sweet November
150,imasry,My words can't describe this masterpiece,10,15 November 2020,It's the best drama movie I watched in my life. I watched this movie more than 10 times and every time I cried and noticed to something new in the movie it's a masterpiece and story very realistic. I recommend this movie to any one don't believe in love and see life is only business and money.,Sweet November
151,djwongdj,The script was two dimensional not the acting!,6,28 February 2006,"This movie was shown over the free channel last Sunday. I read up on the reviews for preparation to be unbiased and fair to it.I think the problem with this movie is a tired plot and a terribly two dimensional script. Keanu's and Charlize's performance was what helped to lift it out of a 4/10 rating for me. Jason Issac as a cross dressing flatmate was a heartwarming portrayal of how friendship does not always come in neat little packages hemmed in by our expectations. His loyalty and support for Charlize's Sara was the real cruncher in this movie for me. Nelson's initial shock and reaction on seeing Jason's Chaz in a loud dress was hilarious only because it does mirror the general population's.The other part of the movie that I find strangely revealing and therefore very endearing, was when Nelson decides Christmas should come a month early for Sara. He pops into her house via the window while everyone is having Thanksgiving and proceeds to give her twelve gifts for Christmas. Each gift and especially the last one, was obviously well thought out in relation to his feelings for her and their relationship throughout that November.I have read snippets of how Keanu is very fiercely protective, private, very loving and giving as a person to those he cares deeply about and that entire scene made me realize this is less acting the part but more a lingering snapshot of a small part of who he really is.I have so far watched ""Speed"", ""A Walk in the Clouds"" and the ""Matrix"" Trilogy, all of which showcases Keanu as a leading man. I must say that I do catch glimpses of what looks like the real Keanu popping up every now and then. So it's no wonder that Sandra Bullock should say that she was very taken by the way Keanu looked at her just before he kissed her at the end of ""Speed"".I think that many people are quick to rubbish Keanu's acting as wooden because they fail to notice that bit of his soul, often very obviously displayed on the screen, just because it usually isn't displayed on his face.Enjoy the movie for what it is, a simple love story with a bittersweet ending and you won't be disappointed.",Sweet November

On the other hand the acting is great. Its not about the remake or whatever people said about the movie,its the beauty that reflects the feeling of love and to do something for those who didn't know it yet.

It's was next Titanic, Charlize Theron is one of the best actresses and Keanu Reeves was also good. This movie was just great, It touched me,ha ha.Sweet November It was very sad for Keane that he was left alone, at that moment I was Thinking 'You can't do that to people, Horrible'. It was a great movie, have fun everyone seeing it. Sweet November had also a sad song in it, en ya - only time, you should listen to that song. Well I have to go now. Bye and everyone should see that movie. bye, I don't know what to say anymore. you know another movie is also great, like, The Da Vinci Code.

155,Witts,Not Bad at All,10,24 November 2001,"Let me just say first of all, that there are elements of this movie that are predictable and cliche, but this is true of 95% of movies - especially romantic comedies.The concept alone is certainly novel. Theron's character was daring, someone who knew what she believed in and stuck by it. Even if her plans were somewhat selfish, isn't everything we do a little selfish?
To me, true characters are the ones we believe. I believed in her character just because of her strong beliefs. Keanu's character was a bit two dimensional, but I think we got the idea. I thought their chemistry was good.I'm afraid that the true reason a lot of people didn't like this movie is because it's a ""feel good"" or positive type of film.  I hate for that type of judgement to happen, because our planet needs films that inspire and educate as well as entertain.This film examines several essential truths in our society.Script-wise a lot of people have bashed this movie. While the script is not the greatest ever penned, it's definitely good. Sure, there are elements of the story that are predictable, but they WORK. Also, there are a few scenes and speeches that are nothing short of literary.Performance-wise Theron was on the mark. Keanu has been better, but had good moments.",Sweet November
156,spools,Good romantic comedy,10,22 February 2002,"I know the story has been used before, two mismatched characters are thrown together and somehow fall in love with each other before the movie and the music ends.  But that is what makes for a good life and a good story.  My wife and I enjoy it very much and have probably watched it more than 25 times already.  Would we give it an Oscar? No, it isn't a movie on that level but next time it's on the cable we'll watch it again.",Sweet November
157,chrisrosek,Sadly disappointed,4,26 February 2001,"I thought this would be a really good chick flick for my monthly Girls Night Out...sadly disappointed. I had an extremely hard time believing Keanu at many points in the film! There were the few moments where he managed to get through a scene without seeming to wooden, but most of the time he struggled! I guess I haven't seen too many of his movies--the ones that pop to mind are ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" and ""Parenthood""--and I think he did a fine job in those. I also saw ""A Walk in the Clouds"" and in that he had me mesmerized, he was so believable!! I don't why, but he just didn't convince me in ""Sweet November""! Charlize Theron was pretty good. I loved the dinner scene with her downstairs neighbors--WAY funny! (Who was Chaz's date? He looked so familiar, but I can't remember the character's name to look it up--HELP)I came to IMDB right after the movie to see what others were saying, wish I'd come here before! You bet I will in the future! (I'm also looking for a rental of the 1968 version--leads anyone?)This movie reminded me a lot of ""Dying Young,"" which I'd watch over and over--""Sweet November,"" once is enough!",Sweet November
158,poetic_star,EXACTLY as it was meant to be.,10,1 April 2001,"I don't understand what everyone's problem is.  This movie was cute, romantic, and sad.  EXACTLY as it was meant to be.  So the acting wasn't up to some people's standards.  Does it always have to be?  So Keanu and Charlize didn't have a lot of ""chemistry"" and ""spark.""  Are they a real-life couple?  No.  Therefore, the realistic part of the audience doesn't expect them to be perfect.  This movie was thought-provoking, dramatic, loving and cute.  If you expected more, you are a complete idiot, because it's obvious you didn't really watch the preview.  I thought it was perfect for the movie it was supposed to be.",Sweet November
159,ruoz77,A wonderful movie!,10,24 February 2001,"This movie is definitely one of my favorites. Not only because the girl is a bit like me (hehe) but because the story really makes you just want to run around like an animal and just HAVE SOME FUN! Enjoy life. The movie is about a feeling-less workaholic named Nelson (Keanu Reeves) who meets a weird (in a good way), different, fun type of lady named Sara (Charlize Theron). Sara has this thing where she takes men into her home and life, and helps them with things. But, just for ONE month. Nothing more. Nothing less. With Nelson, she helps him realize the meaning of life, the feeling of love, and that work and money is not everything. After sometime, Nelson falls in love with her, and asks her to marry him. But, Sarah has a secret. A secret that she doesn't want Nelson to know about. And she doesn't want to marry him because of it. The secret has something to do with why she loves helping people. Why she loves life so much, and why she wants to enjoy life to the fullest as long as she possibly can. I will tell you no more. Go see the movie. It's definitely well worth your time. So drop the cell phone, throw away the neck tie, and get ready to enjoy life! (Note: Bring tissues, the end is a bit sad)",Sweet November
160,sashalee610,foot notes,10,10 May 2006,"I have watched this movie with a group of friends ranging from ages 21 to 32 and i must say it was interesting to hear what they had to say about it. Firstly, the romantic's enjoyed it and agreed that a valuable life lesson was learned when it pertained to the importance of our jobs and the relationships we loose when focusing on the ""self- want- need"" aspect of life however the non romantics where more interested in Charlize Theron's body and beauty, suffice to say the acting was not up for debate...Personally i thought that the Character that Keanu Reeves portrayed was in line with his acting . People who are in advertising aren't exactly the silent type and show emotions through looks and certain gesture s. They are in you face and very verbal i might add. So for the individual that so candidly suggested that the romance of the movie was not in the undertone or made by certain subtle gestures, here's food for thought when ever has love been and romance been subtle , it's loud and in you face, and is world wind experience.This is not Keanu's first romantic movie, ""a walk in the clouds"" as very popular and so was his performance. For my part, action movie's only detract from Keanu's ability because special effects is the worldsfocus, in the entertainment industry. Drama will be an actors turning point in whether or not they can act...",Sweet November

163,d-moonshadow,This was NOT quality cinema....,3,22 February 2001,"I gave this movie a ""three"" for the three funny scenes in it.  Reeves, never the good actor (only mediocre at best), proves once again that ANYONE can make it in Hollywood.  Theron makes a strong showing despite a weak script, but even she can't turn this one around.  With wooden delivery like ""it's a HOT dog...a HOT hot dog..."", Reeves embarrasses not only himself but the people unlucky enough to have spent hard earned money to pay for a ticket for this lousy film.  Enya lends another song to a film, this time ""Only Time"", played twice in the movie.  At one point, it's not really appropriate to what's happening, and the second time, you don't care enough about the movie to bother to make a connection.  Avoid this film at all costs.",Sweet November
164,beckerk,It sucked.,3,5 August 2001,"Easily one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.  The performances were terrible, the plot was extremely questionable, and the supporting characters ranged from obnoxious to unnecessary.  I cannot think of one good part of this film (and I use that term loosely).  Keanu Reeves delivers one of his worst performances ever, and that is saying a lot considering his past work (although ""The Matrix"" proved he is capable of something close to acting).  Charlize Theron was cute and delightful for the first 15 minutes, but she went way downhill after that.

165,tmf222,Give Keanu a Break!,8,23 April 2001,"I have read several reviews for this movie, and I am very upset by them. All they have to say is how Keanu Reeves is such a bad actor.  Frankly I am sick of everyone jumping on that bad wagon.  A few people say that he's a bad actor, then everyone has to jump in and say it too.  Sure, he could have done a few lines of this movie with more feeling, but that doesn't mean he deserves such awful critiques.  When I was in the theater, several people around me were complaining of how it was the worst movie they ever saw. Here I was, still sitting there, trying to let my face return to normal color (I had cried a little).  I was outraged.  The viewers should have enjoyed it for what the movie was, a light romance, nothing more, nothing less.  It wasn't supposed to be Oscar-winning, it was simply supposed to be romantic.  Movies aren't always believeable, but that doesn't mean that it will automatically get bad reviews.  It is really disappointing, because this movie was really good (and really sad).",Sweet November

Yes, I think there are some unclear points in the film but I think it is director's fault not players. I think film would be much better if the director had been more successful.

Don't criticize a film and an actor without the knowledge and the experience.  It's an excellent movie and i rate it 10! Keanu Reeves was excellent in this movie it seems that you can't see him play in a dramatic role because maybe there is too much Matrix in you.  I say maybe. It seems that some people in here didn't get the bottom line of the movie at all.  There's no such thing as perfect! some people even posted their comments without even spelling the actors names right so how can these people criticize the actors and the movie...That's why i laughed when i saw the comments in this page come on people as Ken said maybe if you see the movie again you will have a better understanding of it......That's all i have to say Another thing how many times have you seen a movie and it didn't make sense the first time i have seen plenty so far...like Pulp FictionSweet November was great and very touching i haven't seen such a great movie before.

I caught the film on TCM and fell in love and was so excited when I heard they were doing a remake, then began wishing they had never thought of it when I heard Speed's KR was being cast in the male lead, a part definitely too far above him. Watching his failure to carry the role was almost laughable. Other than that, it was a pretty dreary thing.

It's also incredible how one's mood can affect a person's reaction to a film.  In my case, the movie caught me in the right mood and at the right stage of life.  Thus, it completely hit the spot.  I judge a movie based on how it makes me feel, and to what degree.  I was falling asleep just before the movie came on, but once it started it woke me up immediately.  I then felt slight anger, then some healthy laughter, and at one point I actually cried, which for me (as a 28-year-old macho guy) is a rarity.

Otherwise, it's a pretty bad, rather clichéd sort of a film. I like Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves but this isn't really their shining moment in film. It's a bit of a soap opera. It has some other good actors in it, like Greg Germann and the gal from Gilmore Girls but they're pretty much wasted. If you like romantic soapy movies it's probably worth renting but otherwise I wouldn't bother. It IS interesting to see Reeves in something other than an action film.

188,Zooks_1388,Amazing Movie killed by a horrible ending!,8,1 May 2008,"After reading a few of the comments, I would first like to touch on those comments that lacked in intelligence. Someone made a comment about Abner going to father son day with Nelson Moss saying that it was creepy. Saying that Abner a very shy kid was an easy target for a pedophile. An intelligent viewer would of realized hey Nelson has been with Sarah for about 17 days (if I remember right) and what's funny is the writer made it very clear that Sarah had a strong relationship with Abner. Meaning that most likely Nelson and Abner have a pretty strong relationship as well. But if that isn't enough then what about how after the boat scene Sarah made a point of Nelson being a strong father figure for young Abner. That's why it wasn't creepy!There was another Comment about how the movie was dishonest and how it lead you to believe it was about love but in reality it was about Sarah having control over Nelson. To a point this might be true but it's not completely true because Sarah wouldn't of admitted ever loving him if it was only about control. The person also commented on how Sarah made him fall in love with her (you can't make someone fall in love with you duh...) and then just left him. Just throwing this out there is this the first romance movie this person has every watched? Because I'm pretty sure after the headache scene I realized that she was going to leave him because that's what would be the best ending. Watching her die would of just killed it. It would of caused the movie to drag out to a point no one wants! Seriously no one would want to watch her die, unless that's how the movie started with her dying!My personal view point.This movie was maybe one of the best romance movies I've seen in a long time (I just watched 27 Dresses last night as well). The acting was excellent, I thought that Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron did a wonderful job. They showed a lot of passion and a lot of love. Keanu Reeves from the very start did great being that money driven jerk thinking that his is the ""Big Dog."" (COME ON that's great stuff, they made a theme out of dogs). Charlize was beautiful on the screen and her crazy life loving personality made you want to fall in love with her yourself.This movie also did a great job in the other departments that make a movie great. The music flowed very well with the emotion of the movie. Music is what makes a love movie great and the music in this movie had a lot of it. Not only did the music flow well with this movie but also the lighting. Two key moments, when the movie just starts Nelson's apartment the lighting and the theme was gray and boring. Another key point when he first walked into Sarah apartment, the lighting was Bright and full of life! It screamed life is here! Yet another example of this would be when he first finds her vomiting in the bathroom, the lighting made you feel worried and sad, much like it need to be. Or what about the ending, If it wasn't such a horrible ending it would of made me cry because it had all the emotional lighting you could ask for. That grayish blue lighting that make you know that hey I should be crying right now, what might of made it perfect was if it was raining but they already did that so it would of been a bad idea!What made this great movie a piece of crap that it really is, was it's one fault, the downfall of it all was the ending. That last scene when she runs away and he catches her. Making a good movie drag out TOO MUCH! Personally I feel it would of been much better if he would of woke up and all that he found was a note explaining what she explained at the end. Although the Blindfold thing should of been a nice touch really it made is worse! If she was going to put that blindfold on him then he should of found her. BUT if he found her it would make it even WORSE! For this reason I truly believe that this movie would of been great if and only if the ending wouldn't of been so bad! Before that ending I was ready to say that it was one of my favorite romance movies but then the ending just killed it. Personally I feel that they could of ended when he confess his love for her and tell her that we can stay in November forever! Then it would be a happy ending but we would still understand that she'll die, but at least we would of left with the feeling of a happily ever after feeling!",Sweet November
189,thecairow,...I recommend this movie to everyone young and old...,8,15 April 2009,"Before I start, just wanna warn you that English isn't my native language, so sorry in advance. To put it baldly, this movie intrigued me only because of its ""starting lineup"" KEANU REEVES and CHARLIZE THERON, although in past few years Keanu seems to be taken over T. Cruise's egocentric ways, but lets better stick to the movie. Before watching I had no idea what this movie was like, the only thing I knew it was romantic drama and to be honest how many possible plots there can be for this kind of movie?! Despite this fact I had no prejudice, I simply was hopping to enjoy this movie as it seemed ""nice"", I mean entertaining and easy listening in a movie way. I gave this movie 8 out of 10 and I can clarify why, the beginning of this movie disappointed me a bit, as it was too precipitant (how could I know the reason for this in the start), but it definitely gave this movie a shallow look, plus some lapse did not saved the ""day"" (I mean the episode with submarine). As the movie went on it get a bit better, but all in all it was average impression. Only when everything became obvious, there's where it started to sting. The final scene really did gave me trouble breathing, no doubt the best episode and everyone should come up with his/her own thoughts about it, so I won't impose mine. I had never happen to go through something like this, so I can only imagine how hard (more like impossible) it is. The reason I wrote this is to help (I honestly hope it will) the ones, who base there choices on the IMDb rates, numbers are not the best advisers here. I simply judge by the way it affects me, leaving out all the movie standards and cannons, so take it into consideration. I recommend this movie to everyone young and old, fat and bold (no exceptions). You might not like it, but it will certainly leave an imprint. Thanks for your time, hope it helped.",Sweet November
190,CJKulju,Awesome Movie!,8,22 August 2003,"I rented the film one night, watched it, and I absolutely loved it.  It had comedy, drama, and a little bit of everything.  The ending was one of the best I've ever seen in a movie.  So I go to rate it later, and am shocked by the 5.4 rating.  I really wonder how it got rated so low, because it is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I'd recommend it to almost anyone.  If you haven't seen it, go watch it now, you won't be sorry.",Sweet November

The interaction of Mr. Reeves and Ms. Theron is almost flawless showing that having worked together before always helps! I too noticed the colour ""scheme"" of the movie as well and thought that aspect of the film was very well done as well.  I really enjoyed the movie and recommend it to all of my friends.",Sweet November
194,goodcharlotte_totallyrocks12321,Tear-Jerker,10,15 January 2005,I thought this was like the saddest movie ever Even if it was a bit unrealistic it was still very emotional Just the thought of a love so great and then it being shattered by cancer and soul mates taking to different paths never to see each other again is VERY sad I didn't really like how he was all businessman and then he turned all emotional because that doesn't happen but it was so very romantic a great movie to watch with a boyfriend or husband on a rainy day. I would recommend this movie to everyone i know because it is just so sweet and fun and romantic and then at the end soo sad . I rate this movie a ten its like my new favorite movie,Sweet November
195,melanied,Touching!,10,11 June 2004,"Have your tissues ready for this one girls! What a touching movie! I thought Keanu and Charlize made such a wonderful pair in this movie. Not the type of character that Keanu would traditionally play but let me tell you, he did a remarkable job! Charlize was once again a total hit in this movie, what a talented actress! Charlize's character was so full of life, so bubbly and fun-loving. Sarah (Charlize) had such a zest for life that you couldn't help but smile. I would recommend this amazing movie to anybody with a soft spot for romance! If I were to compare this movie to another movie of the likes I would say its very similar to A walk to remember, but I couldn't pick one over the other, I give them both a 10!",Sweet November
196,eschip-1,Not that bad,7,29 July 2006,"The movie is not that bad as some reviews suggest. Yes, Reeves is not playing a role that comes natural to him and is thus not performing as might be expected of him. Casting is an issue here. Theron on the other hand is excellent and makes up for the under performance of Reeves. Her character really comes to live.The script should have been better thought through. It sometimes gave me the feeling that corners had been cut (time constraints?) and in other cases just wondering why certain decisions were made.A love story yes but also a story how one wants to be remembered. This for me was what the movie was about. Certainly worth watching on DVD.",Sweet November

I have never been to a more romantic movie, or cried so hard at a fictional story. I think everyone should see this movie. I know I called the movie sad, but its not depressing. It's so lovely, and so romantic, that the sadness just adds to the movie, instead of taking away from it. I really loved it. Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron have such great on screen chemistry, and it shows through. Even without the touching storyline, this movie is artistically fantastic. Watching this movie, I felt like I was a part of it. It was this wonderful sadness. It was inexplicably sad, but the love between the characters showed through, making the sadness seem somehow worth it.",Sweet November

I'm a guy and i was really moved by the ending i thought that was real sad and i bawled like a lil baby. I was really impressed at charlize theron's performance and i only say that because she i a great actress and one of the most beautiful people ever and i also like this movie more than the movie (the devils advocate) which stared that same two people charlize theron and keano reevs. Now I'm not really into these kinda movies but this one is just terrific and i cant see why it got the rating it did. I did feel that the ending was a slightly too sad.I thought that he should have gotten to marry her because he showed his love and all his emotion to her and she said ""no."" Now i also say that she had a good reason to say no, because she wanted him to remember her the away he loved her. so i just wanted to say that this movie is in my top 5 favorite movies of all time, and that charlize theron is extremely hot (except in monster which they did an awesome job turning her into that kinda person)",Sweet November

The story is so funny, kooky, sweet and so desperately sad at the end, that I just watch it every time it is on television. We have formed a ""sweet November"" watch....when we know it is on, several of my friends and I will call each other so we don't miss it. It is wonderful when you just need that ""good"" cry. I guess it might be considered a ""chick flick"", but I do know men that loved it too. It is so touching, so real in the validity of her need to control the situation, ANY situation, to feel alive while dying. you cannot help but feel her pain, her love and her fear of loving him.

So now they live with each other happy and some day girl goes crazy and suddenly she is sick and no surprise she has a cancer and as she has mad rules and stuff she leaves the man and THE END.

I think that is was a very nice thing for Sara to do those things for Nelson, even though, yes i do know it is only a movie, but i just like the story to it, except i didn't like the ending, I mean what happens to Nelson after he leaves? What happens to Sara? What happens to Abner? Oh and by the way i thought Lliam Aiken did a phenomenal job in this movie, he was so adorable as a 10-year-old and such a great actor!!!",Sweet November

204,woh1hub02,I must have seen a different movie,8,12 March 2005,"I really fail to see in ""Sweet November"" the faults that the previous reviewer saw. His cynical review does not do the movie, its story or its message justice.The acting is excellent, no doubt, but ""annoying"" is a comment from someone with his emotions firmly implanted where the sun does not shine, and communicates more about the reviewer than it does about the film.Also, it is not a fault per se, that the ending of a film is predictable and I tire of this being used as negative criticism. The message is in the story, and a surprise ending is the last thing this charming story needs, or thankfully, has.Oh, and since I used to be someone exactly like the Reeves character is the start of the movie, I can relate to what it is to discover that there is more to life. His character is real alright, but in the surreal sort of way that only those who have actually been there and escaped, truly understand. Now, if only I had had someone as charming as Ms. Theron to show me :-) Anyway, this is not an ""epic"" film or even a ""great"" film - its just a film with a story a few messages and some excellent performances that will tug on your emotions - not altogether a bad thing in a cynical age.",Sweet November

The MOVIE was GREAT GREAT GREAT! Thumbs up!I suddenly bought this movie out of my curiosity. Seldom did I cried when I was watching any movie and Sweet November made me(exaggeratively speaking) dehydrated. The last scene and the flashback of what they've done in that month was SO TOUCHING!! Most importantly...the movie made us reflect on balance we have to take between Human Relationships and Work. There is no point to have all the money, wealth, physical enjoyments but losing all the relationships that a human ought to possess.I was moved by Charlize and I actually wonder why she's always in movies with sad endings.I am looking forward to North Country hoping that the Hong Kong cinema owners would buy it and show us in theatres.The storyline is simple, plot is not difficult to get but the sensation that it has given to me was a ""Waoh!"".Go and watch it and ignore the crap negative reviews.",Sweet November

""November is all I know & all I ever wanna know.""u can see how u can meet a woman & she makes u feel the life as Sara did, she made Nelson enjoy social life, family, build a life with a partner and all men don't see blesses in life until they met that special woman and say we gotta marry that woman & no one but her gotta be the mother of my child",Sweet November

Will Nelson change and turn into a peace loving vegan? Will Sara finally keep a man for longer than a month?Tired cliché after tired cliché makes Sweet November the worst movie I've watched in a good long while. Here you are enlightened and told that money cannot buy happiness, you should - every once in awhile - slow down and smell the roses, people are more important than your career, cross dressers are people too and - wait for it - women like foreplay. Shocker! One positive though. Usually, Keanu's acting is the worst thing about any movie he's in. In Sweet November he fits right in.",Sweet November
208,harry-262,Great Film,8,6 July 2005,"I've read all the reviews and some forums regarding this film. After seeing it I was impressed throughout the film. Although others say its a typical love story, you have to understand that its from a screenplay and thats how the director Pat O'Connor interpreted the film as. Give credit to where its do. The remake remains the 1960's style of the French New Wave. It uses bright rich colors that Chinese cinema used, the music and light alongside with the decor of the apartment all made this movie great. It a great film to kick back and analyze yourself on all the things that occur in life. If helps one realize how pre-occupied people can be with other things and miss life's finer moments. We all work to make a better life; but, who really has time to enjoy it? Great film Pat O'Connor!!",Sweet November

I didn't really get it then but thought it was very interesting though, so i decided to buy it one day. i don't think i made a mistake by doing so. The movie is actually great, i think Charlize Theron's acting is really good and Keanus is not bad either. In the middle it sometimes gets really boring and just too long but all together the story is really cute and romantic, but not that realistic, it all just happened much too fast. What made me cry so much was the end, i couldn't stop, even after the movie was over and it also made me think about life. That you shouldn't waste time with unimportant or less important stuff and concentrate on the really important things in life, and that is not the money !!I can really recommend this movie, but don't forget a pack of tissues ;)",Sweet November
210,tammy_fitzgerald-65705,I must have been on Mars I just saw this movie and it was amazing,10,14 June 2016,"I really had never, seen, heard, or even had a hint of this movie since 2001. I have about 300 channels, Kindle Video etc. The only reason it probably was off my radar was that my son was only six months old at the time. I am a sucker for love stories, and believe me I've seen my share of rotten eggs masquerading as a love story, and paid for expensive theater tickets because critics said it was a good movie, and then got disappointed. I saw this as a suggestion on my kindle and it intrigued me so I watched it. I can't understand WHY THE CRITICS DISLIKED THIS MOVIE. Chaz (Keaneau), acted the part exactly as it was supposed to be. An insensitive workaholic who never got a mirror shoved in his face. The Character Sara, (Charleze), Showed just as much compassion as desperation, to make a change in someone's life as well as trying to live her life to the fullest. I don't think I'd blame her because I think a lot of people would do the same, knowing the percentage of the cure of her diagnosis. Her choice was to stay in a hospital bed and hope for a miracle or try to live her life without remorse right up to the end. I worked in a nursing home once and saw people being kept alive much longer then their quality of life, which was drug induced pain induced machine extended time machine, as they waited for their lives to end. I wept like a baby at the end. I think the critics hated it because it didn't have a Disney ending like most love stories do, (ie: The Notebook, the Time Traveler, You've got mail ""which I thought the premise of that plot to be entirely ridiculous"", etc). There was some awkwardness in a couple of scenes but in the entirety of the movie I really didn't consider it important. I LOVED THIS MOVIE AND BOUGHT IT THE DAY AFTER I RENTED IT. If you like love stories like ""Somewhere in Time"". You'll love Sweet November.",Sweet November

And sleep with em on the first day? Most importantly why would she invites him to live with her! A complete stranger!! And what's up with the gay friend who kiss's her on the lips.

I couldn't believe that Keanu can play like that and convince me that Nelson fell in love for just one month.I like Sara's story and the way she chooses to live. Charlize, as beautiful as always, made Sara strong and weak at the same time.The great supporting role of drag queen Chaz Watley by Jason Isaacs. I never imagined he'd play something like this!This is the only movie that made me cry and that's why I ranked him with the highest mark. BRAVO!!!",Sweet November

Being a sensitive soul I like when men stand by their strong women but it could have used more of a dynamic script. I have been seriously ill and deserted by the man in my life so the movie is sweet. Keanu, who happens to be a friend of mine from way back, is almost type cast as an action hero. His fans were disappointed. I think most of his Neo fans found the movie ""corny"". Too bad. The Matrix Reloaded NEO is the 300 hundred pound gorilla of his career. People will always compare any of his work with that. I have spoken to him about that. Theron, won an Oscar for a completely different type of female lead. Freudian slip? The movie is really okay on DVD or VHS on a rainy romantic night!",Sweet November
217,ms602,Oh my god... Keanu Reeves can't act.,1,8 December 2005,"Oh my god... Keanu Reeves can't act. It's really horrible to see. I've never seen him in a non-action movie before now, and it's really bad. I'm watching ""Sweet November"" for the first time on TBS. Wait, I've actually seen this before and forgot about it. I only forget movies when they are unremarkable. But seriously, Keanu's acting... Oh my god... I remember really bad movies. Why the hell did I forget about this one? Wanna know the all time worst movie of all time? The Faculty, with Elijah Wood. I won't forget ""Sweet November"" again either.Charlize Theron is extremely attractive as always (probably the only good thing about the film) and fairly well acted. The general logic of action is completely, well, illogical and the dialog is corny as hell. I think I'm just watching for Charlize! But also... Ya know when there's an accident or train wreck, and you can't help but look? It's like that. I can't help but continue watching...The acting of many actors is just unnatural in general. Emotions and feelings are communicated verbally, rather than through body language, and it seems so fake and unrehearsed! Did they shoot this thing in a week or something? There are too many characters, not enough depth or development for any of them, way too many events, and the pace is just too fast for a drama. And Enya singing on the soundtrack? Nice touch of the dramatic, but it seems out of place on this film. The slow music just clashes with the fast story. This director tried to squeeze way too much into a small duration of time and did a horrible job instructing the actors! It's kinda sad to see professional actors doing work that is just so below their abilities. The flow and progression of events is disconnected and haphazard. And then Keanu singing? They really should have done a voice over...OK, I didn't plan to write a review for this movie, but it was just so bad, that I had to complain in some way. I couldn't help but notice that the director of this movie, Pat O'Connor, has not had a directing job since this movie, and that he used to direct TV. Coincidence that he hasn't made a movie or worked since? Yeah, that's a tough call...",Sweet November

Too many times people get wrapped up in stuff and glitz and all technology and everything else we have in this life that we forget that in the end... all we have is each other. For romantic suckers this is a must see movie, enjoy! Nelson is a man devoted to his advertising career in San Francisco. One day, while taking a driving test at the DMV, he meets Sara. She is very different from the other women in his life. Nelson causes her to miss out on taking the test and later that day she tracks him down. One thing leads to another and Nelson ends up living with her through a November that will change his life forever.",Sweet November
