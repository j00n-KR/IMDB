0,SnoopyStyle,Hanks is likable and funny,6,12 September 2014,"Rick Gassko (Tom Hanks) is a cool personable school bus driver soon to be married to Debbie Thompson (Tawny Kitaen). His friends Jay O'Neill (Adrian Zmed), mechanic Rudy (Barry Diamond), nerdy Gary (Gary Grossman), and waiter Ryko (Michael Dudikoff) throw him an outrageous bachelor party. Her old boyfriend Cole Whittier (Robert Prescott) aims to break them up. Her parents don't like him either. His brother Stan (William Tepper) is coming along eager to get away from his wife Tina (Wendie Jo Sperber). They invite drugged up Brad Peckerhead Mollen.This is a simple Tom Hanks vehicle. The problem is that he doesn't have good enough partners to play with. Tawny Kitaen is a reasonable hot good girl. There are some fun scenes. Hanks hitting tennis balls over the fence. The male stripper with the fake hot dog is hilarious. The party getting out of control is fun. The Oingo Boingo song is catchy. These are good individual scenes. There needs to be more of them. It should get to the group bachelor party sooner. At least, the group has some limited comedy bromance chemistry. Adrian Zmed is not good enough to be the best friend. Gary Grossman is good as the funny nerd. The rest of them are acceptable as the boorish friends. Robert Prescott is great as the douche ex. As far as 80s raunchy comedies go, this one isn't too bad.",Bachelor Party
1,lee_eisenberg,married to craziness,8,23 November 2006,"""Bachelor Party"" is a big, stupid, pointless excuse for a movie. And it's proud of being such. That's what makes it so great. One of the many examples of Tom Hanks's career before he started acting in serious movies, it portrays him getting a party thrown by his buddies the day before he gets married. His father-in-law-to-be may try to undermine the wedding, but this guy doesn't know what he's up against! So, while the critic-stapo may say that Tom Hanks is now a serious actor, so these sorts of movies are worthless, I categorically beg to differ. It's just a nice, wacky, not-for-children excuse to have a lot of fun. And when I say not for children, I mean that this movie isn't afraid to do anything that it wants! I assert that it's worth seeing. You're sure to like it.",Bachelor Party
2,BA_Harrison,"Parkview Hotel, room 1002.",7,31 August 2019,"Tom Hanks stars as zany motormouth Rick Gassko, who announces to his friends that he is getting married to his girlfriend Debbie (Tawny Kitaen) in a week's time. Determined to give him a night to remember, Rick's pals organise a wild bachelor party, with porn, drugs, hookers, and a donkey! Will Rick remain faithful to Debbie during the crazy evening of debauchery, or will he cave in and sow his wild oats one last time? Debbie and her wedding shower guests dress up as ladies of the night to crash the party and find out, while Rick's love rival Cole (Robert Prescott) does his best to sabotage the impending nuptials.Bachelor Party, directed by Neal Israel (one of the creators of Police Academy), is a wacky slice of low-brow comedy, a film so '80s that it not only co-stars tasty rock-chick Tawny Kitaen, but also features Adrian Zmed of T.J. Hooker fame, and American Ninja Michael Dudikoff. The very silly antics include Cole sending a pair of prostitutes to Debbie's wedding shower, the boys arranging for a well-endowed male stripper to surprise the women, Rick and pals hanging a naked Cole out of a hotel window (after he shoots at them with a crossbow!), a bestiality floor-show going awry when the donkey hoovers up a fatal dose of drugs, and Rick somehow resisting the temptations of a completely naked Monique Gabrielle (man, that guy has impressive self-control).There are quite a few serious laughs to be had with this delightfully deranged comedy, but I would have enjoyed it a bit more if Tom Hanks' character wasn't quite the massive jerk that his father-in-law-to-be says he is. Quite what Debbie sees in him is hard to fathom: he's an obnoxious, immature, and unrefined slob whose only redeeming feature is his fidelity. Still, even with Hanks' unlikeable protagonist, Bachelor Party is still a lot fun.7/10. Funniest and most quotable lines: ""I hope you like potato salad... it's chunky style... my favorite!"" and ""I wish I had someone I could really respect. Hey, look at the cans on that bimbo!"".",Bachelor Party
3,edwagreen,Bachelor Party is An Animal House *1/2,3,21 April 2010,"A very young Tom Hanks stars in this 1984 film with many familiar themes.As a school bus driver getting married to a girl from an uppity family, Hanks' assortment of odd friends plus his married doctor brother plan the usual bachelor party for him.His father-in-law to be dislikes Hanks so that he gets his daughter's former boyfriend on the case to get rid of our lad.The film is typical of what goes on at our wild, swinging bachelor parties. There is plenty of merriment and glee, especially when the girlfriend and her friends crash the party as hookers.While the very end of the film is hilarious when things get out of hand at the posh hotel where the swinging party is being held, the film is so typical and predictable.",Bachelor Party

5,preppy-3,Crude but fun,7,7 September 2001,"Likable, stupid, crude and very funny movie about Tom Hanks having a bachelor party before he marries beautiful Tawny Kitaen.  Naturally, things go barreling out of control.  It's incredibly tasteless (although somewhat tame compared to today's movies), silly and full of female (and male!) nudity...but damned if I wasn't laughing!  Most of the humor comes from Tom Hanks who's (I assuming) ad-libbing his lines left and right.  Very 80s in terms of clothes and hair.  Brainless but fun.  A perfect example of an R-rated 1980s sex comedy that would get an NC-17 rating today.  Also interesting to see Hanks pre-stardom.  Turn off your brain and enjoy!",Bachelor Party
6,Boba_Fett1138,Amusing silly '80's comedy.,7,23 November 2008,"This is one of those typical silly early '80's comedies, that features lots of immature teenage type of lame humor and nudity and sex jokes.No, this by no means is a great movie and it also is hardly the best the genre has to offer but it's a movie that simply serves its purpose and brings some good entertainment.The movie features dozens of silly and over-the-top characters, who are the main reason why this movie is such a maintaining and silly entertaining one to watch. It features Tom Hanks in an early comical movie role and it actually is sort of a shame he doesn't do movies like this anymore, since he certainly was very talented at it. Not that I mind the movies that he does now days of course but it at the same time is also a waste of his comical talent.The movie also tries to feature some more serious elements, that concentrated on what it means to be married. Not that this works out horrible for the movie but it of course is also distracting a bit from what the movie is really truly about; simple immature comedy. Further more there is very little story actually and it simply features on the events during and around a bachelor party.The movie is so silly, simplistic and immature that you just can't help being entertained by it all. No matter how bad and cheesy it all gets, you can't help laughing at this movie. Some comical moments are just plain great.A real enjoyable silly '80's comedy, starring a young Tom Hanks.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Bachelor Party
7,Aaron1375,"Your basic 80's sex comedy, but this one has Tom Hanks.",8,3 March 2010,"Yes, this one stars Tom Hanks, and from looking at the cast not to many other people I have heard of except for Tawnee Kitane. However, I thought this film was a laugh riot and enjoyed every minute of it. The plot is simple enough. An about to be married man is about to embark on the greatest send off party ever the bachelor party. Things are not so cut and dry though as the female comes from a wealthy family and she has an ex boyfriend who is a bit of a prick too that constantly tries to throw a monkey wrench into the works during the course of the movie. The father of the bride to be also tries to stir the pot a bit too. Well the party starts out rather slowly as the dirty movie has been censored and things are looking rather dull until one of Hanks' buddies finally comes through with the hookers and all bets are off. Drugs, nudity, and donkeys are all the rage!!! Yes, this movie is crazy and your basic sex comedy of the 1980's, but it is also one of the better ones of the era. I like it a lot more than Tom Cruise's ""Risky Business"" as that one takes itself to seriously at times while this one stays light and funny all the way through to the climatic battle in the movie theater where a gal gets punched in the face and thinks it is the 3-d.",Bachelor Party
8,mm-39,This story hits all the sterotypes,5,19 July 2002,"Hollywood can get away with certain sterotypes but not others.  This film like Caddy Shack  has the old established people (people off the May Flower) mixing with the ethnics (Irish, Polish Greek etc)  I am from East Kildonian, the ethnic part of the city, and can relate with this film.  Sure some of us can be loud, along with crazy, but not thin skinned and can laugh at our selfs.  Many of the 80's comedies play on these sterotypes.  My friend, and I remember events from the old neighborhood when we watch this film.  IT's fun to watch but no classic, like most of the 80's films it too cheesy. 5/10",Bachelor Party
9,elo-equipamentos,Tom Hanks introducing himself who afterwards becomes a true hitmaker !!!,7,3 May 2021,"Revisiting this early work of the still young Tom Hanks, with a keen eye we can see a promising star which he became later, reading some comments here, I've picked one that portrays the movie well, those rough jokes don't stands of test of times properly, a bit dated, also politically incorrect to nowadays's standards in many scenes, mainly using a harmful donkey at party that ends up dying for drugs overdose, too much roughhouse in exchange of a scratchy humor highly questionable taste, a true off-color that sounds so weird on current years, Tom Hanks pranksters friends is another low point, too much foolish.However the picture has countless remarkable moments, as when Rick Gassko (Hanks) mocking an old nun with lewd talking, also in tennis play when he hits all balls at a neighbor backyard, letting the owner pissing off, another re-letter moment is a supposedly a betrayal sequence when the head of that gorgeous girl became in old nun inquiring Rick's previous vows of chastity and his own fiancée Debbie (Tawny Kitaen), without forget his mate Gary (Gary Grossman) falling in love for drag queen that pee standing up, just unforgettable, further the plot exploits the nudity over the edge, therefore such thing took the movie be labeled as ""R"", today it should be smoothly a kid's movie in face a new wave of teenager comedies as American Pie's franchise.Blatantly Bachelor Party aged, remains his undeniable legacy of Tom Hanks's debut (Splash and the previous ones don't hold water) in this he really takes off to became a smashing hitmaker whatever he did or touched it becomes in gold at box-office.Thanks for reading.Resume:First watch: 1988 / How many: 5 / Source: TV-DVD / Rating: 7.5.",Bachelor Party
10,Smells_Like_Cheese,"So funny, one of my new favorite comedies!",8,16 May 2008,"I have heard of Bachelor Party a couple times, once on VH1's I love the 80's and also in Clerks 2 there was a small reference. The weird thing is, I'm more used to a dramatic Tom Hanks, other than Big and A League of Their Own, I've never seen him in a raw comedy movie, so it was a little weird to think of Tom Hanks as this very funny male lead in a movie. But I decided to go ahead and give the movie a look, I have to tell you, I haven't laughed so hard and so out loud in a movie like this in a long time. Then I check out the rating on IMDb, 5.7?! Are you kidding me?! This movie is just so beyond funny, I know that it is cliché'd eighties, but come on! I just couldn't believe that anyone else would not find this to be a funny film. If you're telling me you did not find Brad to be funny, you have got to get your funny bone checked because Bachelor Party is non stop laughs from beginning to end.Rick is about to get married to beautiful Debbie, his friends who live to party are throwing him the biggest bachelor party they can have. Debbie's rich and snobby family definitely don't want Rick to be apart of their lives, so Debbie's dad will do anything, including her ex-boyfriend, Cole, who wants her back, to split them up. But the bachelor party night has arrived, and things are going more crazy than the boys have expected.Bachelor Party is seriously funny, it's predictable and silly, especially the end, but it's all in good fun. This is perfect 80's humor, it's the humor I miss and I'm sure others do too, because it's raunchy but doesn't over do it and just has fun with the audience. This cast looked like they had an ultimate blast and Tom Hanks was just brilliant, his character could be a jerk, but such a great guy at the same time, so he's real and likable. This is just a funny movie that I would recommend, it's a lot of fun and the rating on IMDb is just too harsh. Come on, let's get this rating up.8/10",Bachelor Party
11,MovieAddict2016,Works as an amusing time-passer thanks to a likable debut performance by Tom Hanks,6,29 April 2005,"""Bachelor Party"" is very much like other films of its genre except that it is one of Tom Hanks' very early efforts and, as a result, is more fondly remembered than it probably would be without Hanks.Yes, before Hanks turned into Forrest Gump and an Oscar-winning heavyweight actor, he desperately starred in a 1984 teen sex comedy not unlike ""Porky's,"" ""The Last American Virgin"" or ""American Pie."" ""Splash"" had been a success by now so the marketers could rely upon his newly-created status to promote ""Bachelor Party,"" and it paid off -- this movie was an unexpected hit when it came out (albeit a small one).Tom Hanks is a fine actor but I have to say that he had a certain charm about his acting that made many mediocre '80s comedies -- including ""Turner and Hooch,"" ""The 'burbs"" and of course ""Bachelor Party"" -- immensely likable despite their flaws.Yes, this is a crude, lewd, rude movie but it has its fair share of embarrassing moments, laugh-out-loud segments and cheesy (but fun) segments. Good entertainment for a Friday or Saturday night, and a good glimpse at a much younger, thinner, more comedic (and slapstick) Tom Hanks before he got all weepy-eyed and serious on us.",Bachelor Party
12,ksf-2,updated version from the 1957 one,8,3 February 2020,"The original version was a pretty serious discussion of marriage infidelity with SO many huge hollywood stars... kind of a psychological thinker piece; the 1984 version is much more of a comedy piece, with a YOUNG tom hanks. the original was written by the famous Paddy Cheyevsky; this one is much more geared toward the younger crowd, and rightfully so. Even the 1984 version is a bit dated at this point, but its still fun, with TONS of humor along the way. the blue collar crowd rents a hotel room, and have crazy adventures. Tom Hanks, about to be married, needs to decide what's important to him. i HIGHLY recommend this version... skip the one from 1957. many similarities, but the newer one is so much more fun! fewer big names, but the script is so much better.",Bachelor Party
13,DKosty123,This is a Bachelor Party,7,1 July 2007,"When I first saw this film, I noticed a lot of raunchy humor, & this film is really one of a young Tom Hanks better early efforts. Because of it's R rating & some pretty soft core near porn it will not be work Hanks is remembered for.This film is a better film than most would give it credit for. The film sets a decent pace, employs some classic comedy techniques & overall when you watch it, you get the feeling the cast & crew actually had fun making the film & it spills over onto the screen.In a way, this film is the most like it's title. This is an adult bachelor party with all the raunchy that any adult party could have. There is a sequence near the end in a theater which borrows it's setting from some earlier comedy films but puts a different spin upon theater reality. Once in a while, this sequence shows up in some places as an example of a great movie comedy sequence as it is that good.Critics were too snooty to give this film much of anything positive because it is not a film for the kiddies, but even though some of the gags fall flat depending on the viewer, there are enough gags that hit the target that this is a pretty indecently delicious piece of entertainment. It is faster paced than PORKY'S but done with a different style.",Bachelor Party
14,The-Sarkologist,Old Style 80s Comedy,5,4 October 2021,"This is another film that I was rather surprised to find on Disney+, considering that Disney+ tends to be a family focused streaming service. Yeah, this film really isn't family focused, considering that it contains nudity, sexual references, and scenes involving drugs. Actually, the one thing that I remembered about this film from when I saw it last was the scene involving the mule, but because I hadn't seen this film in such a long time I simply couldn't remember all that much about it. Also, because I was a mere teenager, I really didn't get the drug references either.The film is about this guy that is about to get married, so his friends decide to throw a bachelor party. Mind you, he lived a pretty wild life, and there is all this discussion about how bad marriage is because it pretty much means that you can no longer sow your wild oats, and in a way end up being chained to another person. However, a lot of it has to do with how he is trying to be faithful in the lead up to the wedding, despite all of his friends, and his brother, trying to convince him to do otherwise.Mind you, there is the bride's family, who happen to be rather wealthy, and quite upperclass. The father, of course, doesn't want his daughter marrying him, but he realises that he has little power over his daughter's decisions. Instead he gets this other wealthy guy, who happens to be young and single, to do what he can to disrupt the wedding. Of course he fails, but the thing is that this guy is so inept, and so stupid, that he pretty much fails at every turn.Yeah, the film isn't too bad, and we do get to not only see a rather young Tom Hanks, but Tom Hanks playing a character that one generally doesn't expect him to play. In fact, I tend to associate Tom Hanks with more family friendly comedy movies, so seeing him in a sex romp comedy also is somewhat peculiar. Yeah, as a film it was okay, but nothing particularly great.",Bachelor Party
15,tomgillespie2002,Crude journey into the mind of jock-mentality,2,10 June 2011,"Man-child bus driver Rick Gassko (Tom Hanks) surprises his friends when he announces he is going to get married to his girlfriend Debbie (Tawny Kitaen), much to their horror. In his honour, they plan to throw the greatest bachelor party in history. Worried that Rick will be unfaithful, Debbie and her friends leave their own bridal shower to go to a strip club, and then to crash the bachelor party. Rick must resist his temptations, and deal with a psychotically jealous ex-boyfriend (Robert Prescott), a transvestite hooker, a mentally unstable school friend, and a coked-up donkey.When I watched this I really felt in the mood for a bit of 80's cheese. The sex/teen comedies that came out in that decade were hugely successful, and were usually funny in a guilty way. Films such as Porky's and Fast Times At Ridgemont High managed to balance gross-out humour, coming-of-age, and an odd vein of sweetness to good effect. Bachelor Party, however, is an unfunny, offensive and appallingly crude journey into the mind of jock-mentality.90 minutes of a group of middle-aged men with bad haircuts and even worse fashion sense grope and drink to excess does not a good film make. Apparently the idea of the film came from the director and the majority of the crew attending a similar bachelor party. I couldn't imagine a more nightmarish prospect. Apart from the odd funny line - ""Gentlemen, start your boners!"" - this is desperately devoid of ideas and inspiration. And Tom Hanks' character is one of the most annoying in cinema history. He plays tennis with his fiancé and his future in-laws and repeatedly hits the ball out of the court laughing like a child. Debbie's father hates him, and we're supposed to think he's a stuffy old man. If I had a daughter that was considering marrying someone like Rick Gassko, I'd throttle the both of them in their sleep.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Bachelor Party
16,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Some good screwball comedy instincts, but the misogyny is overpowering",4,19 November 2017,"Pardon the grumpiness, but ""Bachelor Party"" might be the most misogynistic comedy ever realized on screen. At least that I've seen. There's room to be forgiving of the attitude toward women that most 20th century films have, but ""Bachelor Party"" seems to bend over backward to make women the butt of the joke — or more accurately to this film, the t**s.""Bachelor Party"" sees bus driver Rick (Tom Hanks) and retail worker Debbie (Tawny Kitaen) deciding to get married, launching Rick's sad sack of a friend group — Jay (Adrian Zmed), Gary (Gary Grossman), Rudy (Barry Diamond), and Ryko (Michael Dudikoff) — into discussion of the hookers they're going to hire. Meanwhile, Rick's disapproving future father-in-law (George Grizzard) convinces his preferred choice for Debbie, Cole (Robert Prescott) to sabotage the party and the engagement. The film is the series of gags that ensue, which also includes what happens at Debbie's shower.So many films of this era are patterned this way, with sex-themed debauchery the primary objective. What sets ""Bachelor Party"" apart — in all the wrong ways — is its one- dimensional (that dimension being sex-crazed) characters whom it holds up as being cool and clever despite programming them to do nothing but objectify women. Of course Rick is written to be the exception — and serve as the film's argument for why it isn't sexist.Bob Israel, with writers Neal Israel and Pat Proft —who just a few months before this film released their first ""Police Academy"" movie — write a funny screwball comedy in many respects, but so many jokes are contrived and tailored to sexual situations, i.e. laughs that come at the expense of women (and in one case, a trans character). That it even flirts with a character having sex with a donkey is sad. Other things can be funny.The film's ambition to be the next ""Animal House"" is so transparent that it borders on pathetic. There's its use of Mozart to create irony similar to the opening of ""Animal House,"" but the coup de grace is when Rudy, the character with rocks for brains (aka this movie's Bluto/John Belushi), is seen chugging a bottle of Jack Daniel's. Only ""Animal House"" can be ""Animal House."" That film at least made up for its treatment of women with a unique quirkiness, charming characters and a greater purpose in evoking the nostalgia of the vintage collegiate experience.Israel and Proft do a killer job in one respect — Rick's dialogue. In spite of everything around him, Hanks might give his funniest performance of all time in this movie. His lines are razor sharp and display incredible wit and Hanks oozes with charm. His work and character salvage the movie and then some.It feels harsh to go after a film from 1984 for being misogynistic; ""Bachelor Party"" was far from the lone perpetrator. Yet the design of this movie calls particular attention to its penchant for exploitation and sours the experience of revisiting this comedy in a way it doesn't for other similar films. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

17,jadavix,"Some funny moments, but hard to sit through",7,11 May 2016,"I wanted to like ""Bachelor Party"" more than I did. It has a few genuinely funny moments, which is a few more than most sex comedies, but I found it really hard to sit through.The problem is that the characters are screamingly obnoxious. Literally: they spend most of the movie screaming. Everything they do involves screaming.The plot is about a bus-driving goof, played by Tom Hanks, who is set to marry a rich babe who he could never have conceivably met. Her family isn't pleased and enlists a jerk to take Hanks out of the picture. Of course, the jerk has blonde hair. Why do rich jerks always have blonde hair in these movies?Actually, that's more of a subplot, I guess. The real plot is about the party. The goof's obnoxious friends plan a party in the first half of the movie, and hold the party in the second half. It just gets crazier, so credit to the filmmakers for delivering.Aside from Tom Hanks, the only memorable character in his group of friends is a suicidal drug using weirdo who attempts to drown himself in the bathtub and gives cocaine and quaaludes to a donkey. None of the other friends have discernible personalities, which is disappointing considering we spend so much time with them. They just scream and shout and make messes. The movie is trying to depict a party we'd all like to go to, and I wouldn't even want to be in the same building.",Bachelor Party
18,drqshadow-reviews,"A Wild and Crazy Warpath of Drugs, Sex and Alcohol - That's What I Call a Great Bachelor Party",8,20 June 2014,"Raunchy, easygoing frat boy entertainment that could only have come from the 1980s. Crammed with all the hallmarks of party films from that decade - glaring fashion choices, oodles of saxophone, frequent gratuitous nudity and tons of recreational drugs - it's wafer-thin and proud. The title pretty much tells you all you'll need to know about the plot, which frees up the rest of its running time to go nuts with blasphemous humor and increasingly inebriated acts of questionable legal standing. It's a perfect fit alongside the wild-eyed greats of its generation; Caddyshack, Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds, make some room. Tom Hanks sometimes presses too hard to look crazy, unruly and cool, and often leaves us wondering how anyone could agree to marry such a slob (this may be the first time I've ever agreed with the pensive father-of-the-bride in this kind of movie), but when the music starts blaring he makes for a great master of ceremonies and that's really what the role called for. Pointed and unpredictable, balls-out and funny as hell, it's fantastic at what it sets out to do.",Bachelor Party

20,jimbo-53-186511,A painful overacting shouting contest,1,18 March 2017,"Rick Gassko (Tom Hanks) is getting married to his partner Debbie Thompson (Tawny Kitaen). As a last hurrah, his friends decide to make his last few days as a bachelor a memorable occasion by throwing a 'bachelor party' for Rick, but predictability things get out of hand.To criticise a film like Bachelor Party for being lewd and crude is probably a little unfair; after all these things can work in a film as long what you're seeing is funny, but very little actually works in this film.The script is rather shaky and at times a lot of the plot elements seem unlikely or hard to believe; I found it difficult to understand why someone like Debbie would want to marry someone like Rick in the first place? What exactly does she see in him? OK, he has some likable qualities, but that aside I found it hard to believe that any respectable woman would want to be with him and nothing that we witness gives us any reason to believe in their romance. There is also a sub-plot involving another guy trying to sabotage Rick and Debbie's relationship which seldom raises any laughs and is just plain stupid. He spends his whole time trying to make Rick look bad when Rick is seemingly perfectly capable of doing this himself which, to me, seemed like a lot of wasted effort.You know what though, this is a film so therefore I can genuinely roll with the story, and perhaps suspend some disbelief for how the story unfolds, but what really grates here is that the film is generally unfunny as a whole. There are no real jokes or gags in the film and what we're left with are a lot of gross-out scenes with all of the actors shouting at each other in some kind of embarrassing 'overacting contest'. There are a couple of minor chuckles in this film, but these moments are drowned out by the director's own indulgence and excess. As well as being irritating, many of the characters are unlikeable making this film hard to tolerate over its 100 minute running time. I think one of the biggest missteps here was portraying one of Rick's friends as being a depressed man who hates his marriage - this was presumably intended to be funny, but this character has no dimension or depth and as a result he comes across as being a whiny annoying jerk (like all of the other characters).The failures in this film can be attributed to both writer and director; the script is generic and weak, filled with one dimensional characters who are given nothing to work with. Likewise the director is also to blame for allowing all of the actors to embarrass themselves in what is nothing more than a painful exercise in overacting and shouting with very little spark or imagination. It's a horrid, humourless, indulgent piece from start to finish.",Bachelor Party

As for the rest of the cast (including Adrian Zmed and Tawny Kitaen), they progressed just as far as their collective talents would take them, nowhere.As for Bob Israel's story (adapted to the screen by Neal Israel and Pat Proft), it isn't enough to describe it as bad taste. Even the foul comedy is foul, and the camp humour just isn't funny.

24,PredragReviews,"""It's time to put Cochise out of business""",7,12 July 2016,"Back in 1984, before Tom Hanks became Mr. Oscar-Award, he made a little film called Bachelor Party, which to this day is one of the all-time funniest movies I have ever seen. There is something about early-to-mid 1980's comedies like these that you just don't see anymore. On a personal aside, I don't know what it is about actors with a natural gift for slapstick and comedy (Jim Carrey is the latest example), that turn serious and only go after roles that are only potential Oscar winners. Tom Hanks has made some excellent movies since 1984, no doubt about that.Also adding the enjoyment of the film are the supporting cast, especially Adrien Zmed as the best friend and bachelor party ringmaster and Robert Prescott as Cole, the competitor for Hanks' bride, a warm-up for his hilarious role as Kent in ""Real Genius"". Tom Hanks sometimes presses too hard to look crazy, unruly and cool, and often leaves us wondering how anyone could agree to marry such a slob (this may be the first time I've ever agreed with the pensive father-of-the-bride in this kind of movie), but when the music starts blaring he makes for a great master of ceremonies and that's really what the role called for.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Bachelor Party

He's made quite a name for himself as a serious actor.Then, there were the early years.As a guy whose friends throw him the ""Bachelor Party"" of the title, Hanks wisecracks right and left, making fitting comments on all he sees while the script (by Israel and Proft of ""Police Academy"" fame) even manages jokes about hookers at bridal showers, OD-ing donkeys, hotel windows who have TOO GOOD a view of the moon and baby photographers who forget the kid and concentrate on the mom.If the guys from ""Animal House"" ever got married, this would be what to expect, with Hanks as a genial, raunchy ringmaster of this comedy of errors.

The title pretty much tells you all you'll need to know about the plot, which frees up the rest of its running time to go nuts with blasphemous humor and increasingly inebriated acts of questionable legal standing. It's a perfect fit alongside the wild-eyed greats of its generation; Caddyshack, Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds, make some room.

Let this movie serve as warning to anyone even THINKING of throwing a party as this seems to confirm Murphy's Law: If Anything Can Go Wrong, It Will. The movie has a great soundtrack and Adran Zmed really wails on ""Little Demon"" as the craziness occurs around him. Hanks' character, no matter how nuts he seems to act, turns out to be quite, sensitive and reserved as he hides in a corner and finally retreats to a back room as his buddies keep having the fun, but they keep dragging him back into it. For my tastes, Tawni Kitaen, now or then, is not much of a beauty, but Wendi Jo Sperber (Tom's Busom Buddies co-star) is also on hand as his sister-in-law. This movie does win the ""Scary Movie"" award for unnecessary sex jokes, but the scenes at the photo studio, the garage and the 3-D theatre are some of the funniest.",Bachelor Party

But back in the 80's Hanks was an extremely funny actor. It might be hard to imagine after movies like Forrest Gump and The Terminal, but he used to be an extremely hilarious guy. One way to prove it is this movie Bachelor Party. This is honestly one of the funniest movie of the 1980's. This really was a movie that ushered in the whole party movie genre which continued throughout movies like Dazed and Confused and recent films like Superbad.

You can start telling that it is ununderstandable that Hanks ever chooses such roles but that's not the point as not only the talent from Hanks is there and this is a very funny movie, nothing more but also nothing less... This isn't a timeless classic it is just supposed to make you laugh. Mr Hanks tell his friends he will marry but before that his friends wants him to organize a bachelor party...and the standards of Hanks friends only see a god party when there are hookers around... Well yes, everyone has their own taste and the funny thing is that Hanks is not only chased by his forthcoming bride (Tawny Kitaen) but also by her parents who think Hanks is a looser of the highest category. Some will be offended by it as after all this movie only has sexjokes (even bestiality) but if you just wanna have a laugh and forget some scenes with stupid overacting, Bachelor Party is quite nice...",Bachelor Party

36,Gideon24,One of my favorite Guilty Pleasures,6,8 March 2015,"My list of guilty pleasures would not be complete without mention of 1984's Bachelor Party, a raunchy, laugh riot that made the world sit up and take notice of a young actor by the name of Tom Hanks.Hanks plays Rick Gassko, an aimless but funny guy who is engaged to a beauty named Debbie, who, upon learning that Rick's friend's are throwing him a bachelor party, makes Rick promise not to have sex with any women at the party and it is on that thin thread line that this comic riot hangs. Throw in an obnoxious nerd named Cole, who is also in love with Debbie and adored by her father, who can't stand Rick, you have all the makings of a classic comedy.Don't get me wrong, this film is no classic...the actors playing Rick's buddies, including GREASE 2's Adrian Zmed, give forced and over-the-top performances that tend to grate and when the actual bachelor party happens, it's not nearly as raunchy as we are expecting, but this film does have a lovely leading lady in Tawny Kitean as Debbie, fun supporting performances from Robert Prescott as Cole and George Grizzard as Debbie's father, but more than anything else, this film brilliantly showcases the commanding comic presence of Tom Hanks, who appears in just about every scene and never makes you regret it. Usually in a film like this, the leading man plays straight man to his supporting players, but Hanks is the show here and makes this not-so-great comedy seem a lot better than it really is.",Bachelor Party

40,MetalGeek,Classic Raunch!!!,7,30 March 2010,"I was 14 years old when ""Bachelor Party"" was released...therefore I was too young to see it in a theatre as it was rated ""R,"" and of course Mom and Dad weren't going to take me to see such a film. About a year after that it happened to come on HBO one night while my parents were out for the evening, so I excitedly sat down to watch this forbidden fruit. I laughed my ass off for the entire movie, of course, and the experience was heightened by the knowledge that if Mom and Dad came home before the movie was over and caught me watching it, they would've kicked my butt. Fortunately the film ended before they returned, so I got away with my little indiscretion. That's my main ""Bachelor Party"" memory and why the film remains so special to me all these years later.Seeing it again after a quarter of a century (! has it been that long?) I was confronted with a blast of nostalgia. ""Bachelor Party"" is now a true time capsule of the '80s and as soon as it started I was transported back to my junior high days. Hard to believe that Tom Hanks -- yes, THE Tom Hanks -- got his start in goofball comedies like this, ""Volunteers"" and the sit-com ""Bosom Buddies"" before becoming an award winning serious actor. Hanks is likable in just about anything, and ""Bachelor Party"" is no exception. His character, a goofy slacker named Rick who drives a school bus for a living, has somehow lucked into marrying the gorgeous Tawny Kitaen (who would become famous a few years later for her turn in several Whitesnake videos, then infamous after that for her drug and alcohol fueled activities), to the horror of her rich parents. Rick's party-animal friends (including Adrian Zmed of ""Grease 2"" and ""T.J. Hooker"" fame) want to send Rick off into married life with the bachelor bash to end all bashes, and so the characters descend on an upscale hotel suite with all the class of a horde of Vikings on the attack. The party has all the sleazy trimmings you'd expect (drugs, hookers, booze, porn, strippers, etc.) plus a few hilarious asides such as a pimp who ""looks like Gandhi"" and a well endowed male stripper who goes by the stage name ""Nick the Dick."" Rick's fiancé, afraid that he will be unfaithful to him during said party, decides to crash the proceedings with her friends, leading to predictable '80s raunch-comedy chaos. (A naked guy hung out of the hotel window! A Marilyn Monroe lookalike stripper who turns out to be a guy in drag! A cocaine-snorting donkey that dies of an OD!) I laughed just as hard as I did when I was a teenybopper! This movie still holds up as one of the best low brow comedies of the 80s, if not of all time.

Only one-third of its jokes work.  The gags came so fast and furiously however that that was fine.  I still ended up laughing throughout. This movie is definitely crass and vulgar (and dates from an era before network tv sitcoms regularly stooped to the same level) but, for those of us who can except such slimy humor, it's ding dang funny.  The film-makers understood humor, how to make a film, and how to make a film funny.  Most of the other teenage smutfests are NOT as competently made as this.

I expected there to be the standard character introductions and build up to the bachelor party but all of that stuff really worked and was very funny, and then the bachelor party happens and this is where the film is at its weakest. Hanks spends almost the whole movie delivering wisecracks and while he can be funny and charming doing so on occasion, and while this was a early career flick and he was trying to find his niche as an actor this type of comedy on the whole doesnt best suit him or his character. It seems to be a much better fit for someone like Bill Murray or Chevy Chase, and given this is the period where he was a straight comedy actor I am sure he took a few lessons from those guys for this flick. There is a subplot involving Hanks' fiancee's ex-boyfriend bribing him to end his relationship and then Hanks tries to get even with him by having him and his friends pull pranks on the ex-boyfriend. This subplot has some of the biggest laughs in the movie and the movie could have worked a whole lot better if it was about a love triangle between these two guys and having to fight over this woman's affection. That could have had real potential. But the bachelor party stuff provides very few laughs and the set up for the jokes surrounding it just doesnt pay off. The movie is called Bachelor Party so wouldn't it be fair to expect most of the laughs to come from it? They dont really. Not a bad movie by any means and I definitely did laugh at times but not for the reasons I expected to. The bachelor party itself should have been much funnier than the other subplots involved but proved to be the least interesting thing which is ironic as that is what the whole movie's focus should be.",Bachelor Party

Very pleasantly surprised to find that it really was still funny, even if Hanks himself is so over the top that it makes the central storyline (Tawny Kitaen wants to marry him) unbelievable. Its silly, low brow, and yet exuberant and consistently funny throughout. One of those movies where everybody is having such a good time that its hard not to yourself, and the jokes are fearlessly tasteless. Not a classic, but still fun nearly 30 years later (has it been nearly 30 years? wow!).",Bachelor Party
48,eti55,THE Funniest Movie I've Ever Seen,10,9 November 2014,"I often compare Bachelor Party to the Hangover movies to illustrate the right way and the wrong way to do a raunchy comedy. Then again, the Hangover movies did a lot more box office biz, so what do I know? The Hangover is a crude and raunchy attempt to be funny. Bachelor Party was also crude and raunchy..along with being infinitely more clever and laugh out loud funny. The first time I watched it all the way through I wondered if it was physiologically possible to literally bust a gut from laughing so hard.Rick Gassko (Tom Hanks, who was never funnier), a wise cracking bus driver for a Catholic school, is about to get married to rich girl Debbie (Tawny Kitaen), and her parents are none too thrilled about it. Neither is her anal-retentive, rich ex boyfriend Cole, who's still obsessed with her (at one point he ultimately offers Rick his new Porsche in exchange for Debbie). Rick's hard partying friends don't much like that their buddy is settling down either. They want to make sure Rick ""goes out in style,"" and throw him the bachelor party to end all bachelor parties at a super swank hotel, complete with hookers. This prospect doesn't sit too well with Debbie, and she forces Rick to promise he won't cheat on her. All kinds of wild stuff ultimately ensues..including an outing to Chippendales (where the gals in his fiancée's bridal shower end up showing up..and the guys subsequently pull a prank on them), a donkey that arrives in disguise, a hilarious exchange with a Hindu pimp, and Cole taking pot shots at Rick with a crossbow from an adjacent hotel.A number of things work in Bachelor Party, starting with a really funny script (supposedly this was at least partially based on the real life bachelor party of one of the writers). Something else this movie achieved was that it drew me right into what was going on. I actually felt like I was right in the middle of this epic bachelor party with Rick and his wacky friends, for whom depravity and debauchery are virtues. But the centerpiece is Hanks, who took what could have easily been a shallow character and made him three dimensional. Rick shows genuine worry about the prospect of perhaps cheating on his fiancée, and also shows concern over Brad, one of his friends at the party, who believes in better living through chemistry..while at the same time is suicidal over the breakup of his own marriage. But mostly he's an irrepressible wise ass (i.e. picking up the school kids: Sister, you look terrific today! What have you done with your hair? Later, over the bus intercom: Attention passengers, we are now leaving nun central on our journey to hell and beyond. The captain has turned off the no smoking sign, and you may now move about the cabin freely. Thank you for being Catholic, and for choosing the St. Gabriel school bus).The guys who round out Rick's motley bunch of friends are perfect in their respective parts, particularly Adrian Zmed, who plays Rick's best buddy O'Neil and is damn near as funny as Hanks. The female characters (along with Debbie's father and the aforementioned Cole) are overall a humorless bunch..which makes the guys' antics that much funnier.Some pretty raunchy and potentially dark stuff happens in this movie, which might have even offended my sensibilities had it been handled wrong, from Brad's suicidal tendencies (which had the potential to not be funny at all) to what happened with the aforementioned donkey. But even the really crude stuff was handled deftly, in a way that left me laughing rather than cringing (conversely the Hangover mostly made me cringe). Again, it's Hanks' flawless comic timing which ultimately makes this film. There are one or two scenes where I'm sure he improvised dialog. Warning: This movie is raunchy..lotta nudity and graphic sexual references, and definitely deserving of its R rating. And there are elements about it which by today's standards are a bit dated. But this is one funny movie..they don't make 'em like this anymore, alas.",Bachelor Party
49,FunnyMann,Classic sophomoric romp,7,25 October 2001,"WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERSOne of the things I enjoy about this movie is the mere fact that it exists. I'm thinking Tom Hanks scratched this one of his resumé long ago, along with ""Dragnet"" and ""Volunteers."" I delight in the notion that some folks who love Hanks from films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""You've Got Mail"" might stumble onto this puppy and give it a shot based on more recent work. Boy are they in for a shock. Even this early, in 1984, it's obvious Hanks had the capability of spinning gold from pewter. Because the script is nothing more than an endless series of low-brow gags and d*ck jokes. But in Hank's hands, it all comes out much better than you'd think.I think the second-most famous person in this film is either Tawny Kitaen or Adrian Zmed, so what does THAT tell you? (By the way, think they get Christmas cards from Hanks?) But the odd assembly of buffoons and horndogs here team up to do some surprisingly funny work.Sometimes I'll take one scene and let it sum up a movie's entire mindset. I can definitely do that for this flick: In the middle of a donkey show at the bachelor party, the donkey wanders off, snorts a lot of coke, munches a bunch of pills and drops dead of a massive coronary on the spot.
So ask yourself this: Am I the type of person who thinks a sex-show donkey OD'ing on blow and pills is funny? If no, steer clear. If yes, you may proceed. I might be nuts, but I say...7/10.",Bachelor Party

Also, it narrative that he tries to moralize his obnoxiousness is so infuriating. No one calls out the guy for literally making fun of his in-laws. And I know that guy also hits below the line but I oddly sympathize to him more.The film also losses a lot of point because it is very dated. Since it chose to shy to go full 'obnoxious', it does not necessarily have the pass that films like Ferris Bueller had. Its awkward seeing them go full idiot and have seemingly infinite passes, topped with a moralizing message that he is just any guy.Overall, I hate this film.

It has boobs, and while Tom Hanks is not missing a red shoe (wink wink) his performance is funny enough. If you want to laugh, look no further. And of course, since we have stated that this is going to be a silly movie, do not expect anything serious on it.So why the 7 points? Well, the biggest problem is the music. It is everywhere and it serves almost no purpose. Then is the shouts. The guys are shouting almost all the time. Hey! I lived thru the 80s myself, and I did some weird things and being on parties not that dissimilar than the one portrayed, but the amount of shouts is just excessive, both for a movie and for a real life event. Finally, there are some plot holes here and there, some parts that need not to be there, and some parts that could have been further developed.So, my verdict is to go watch it if you are on a lower Wednesday night and need to raise your spirit.

There are many funny moments throughout the film, but the funniest is probably the scene at the male strip club with Nick the Dick.  Also funny is Brad, a childhood friend of Hanks and his buddies.  As you can guess from the title, the movie is about a bachelor party for Hanks thrown by his friends to celebrate his impending marriage to sexy Tawny Kitaen.  Her elite snob family disapproves, of course, with her ex-boyfriend determined to put a stop to the union.  The film is in the tradition of ANIMAL HOUSE, PORKY'S, and the like.  It does tend to get a bit too silly at times, especially the climax at the movie theater, but no big deal.  The only time the movie goes wrong is when it gives the incredibly sexy Monique Gabrielle a criminally brief cameo.  Her role should have been much larger.",Bachelor Party

I must have been 5 or 6 when i first saw this and I loved the Racy and zany humor I didn't know it wasn't for kids but I didn't care. Tom hanks Roots are built on movies like this and big the Donkey scene was too funny so was the guy being wrapped up in sheets being lowered from the hotel. I am not for censorship so i would not mind any one seeing it My sister and cousins like me could see it and others like it at a young age. Like one crazy summer moving violations It's Under-rated and doesn't get the acknowledgment it deserves. This is an 80's classic and a big part of tom hanks early career. I give it 7/10.,Bachelor Party
54,jennie0409,Fun Saturday Afternoon Flick,5,30 November 2002,"""Bachelor Party"" may not become your favorite movie of all-time, but it's great when you have some extra time to waste, say, on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Tom Hanks is hilarious in this film. His female co-star, Tawny Kitaen, is a great match for Hanks. They have a chemistry with each other, and play off each other well. This movie is quite crude, but what else can you expect from a bachelor party? Hanks is the only well-known celebrity of today to star in this film. I don't think this takes too much away from the movie, however. This movie is enjoyable. Try it out sometime!",Bachelor Party
55,JohnMcClane88,The Greatest Party Movie Ever!!,8,2 June 2000,"Anyone who critiques this movie on its acting, story, or redeeming values, well then forget it! They just don't get it! This movie was made for laughs and that's what you get! There are only a hand full of movies you can play at a party where everyone will stop what they are doing and watch, some are (and take note, these movies must be seen unedited!) ""Animal House"" ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Airplane"" But the greatest one of all is ""Bachelor Party"" I know I have thrown a few parties where everyone is dancing, partying, but you put this movie on and slowly a crowd forms in front of the TV and people start laughing and have a great time. I heard once a few years ago that Tom Hanks said in an interview that this was his favorite movie to make because he had so much fun making it, well it shows! I do have to say that if you have only seen this movie edited on TV and not on video, you are missing out! This is one of those movies that must be seen unedited!",Bachelor Party
56,Shan-12,Regardless of what you think of the film as a whole ...,7,25 December 1998,"... this has one of the funniest scenes of all time involving a carsun roof. Crude, rude and highly vulgar but still hysterically funny.",Bachelor Party
57,elpresidente-4,Fails to live up to the expectations,2,16 April 2020,"I've known this movie for many years but only got to watch it recently. I've always heard what a good comedy it was and how funny it was. I realized that all this is a lie in the first scene with Tom Hanks and the nun. The jokes are forced and rely mostly on shouting and obsession with sex. There are many scenes in this movie with people partying and having ""fun"". It looks very fake and from their forced cheerful expressions it's obvious most of these extras consider this experience a very low point in their career. There were only two moments where I laughed in this movie, so that's why I give it two stars. Avoid this movie unless you are a man-child with low threshold of amusement.",Bachelor Party
58,CptPtnia,Underrated,6,23 January 2000,"OK...so the content is sophomoric, and essentially aimed at the teenage party crowd.  And it has Adrian Zmed in it.  But despite these shortcomings, the humor in this movie is actually quite good, and in the right frame of mind one would consider this a very funny movie.  It's no surprise that Hanks didn't get an Oscar for this one, but it's still worth a look.",Bachelor Party
59,jerrilynnbthomas,1984 was a very good year,10,19 March 2010,My boyfriend took me to see Bachelor Party during my senior year in high school. It was the most fun I had in a long time. I was scanning Encore an hour ago and came across Bachelor Party. I immediately turned to it. I was curious to find out what it was rated on IMDb since it is one of my all time favorite movies. How can it be just 5.8? Bachelor Party has everything you need in a crazy 80's movies. The hilarious scene with the female strippers who show up at the Bachelorette Party. The bathroom scene where one of the friends of the groom tells him that he's met his soul mate only to find out the hooker who serviced him is a man so he jumps into the shower to scrub his privates. How about the scene with the hot dog bun at the male stripper club?Don't even get me started on the donkey? Bachelor Party is a movie that satisfies every time. It never gets old.,Bachelor Party
60,betty-9,Funniest dirty movie of the 90's...,9,29 September 1998,Classic movie of the 80's. Tom Hanks is charming as the soon to be groom.. A treat for those seeking 80's nostalgia and dirty slapstick humor. Highly recommended!,Bachelor Party
61,markjayaweera2003,I wish I was old enough in 1984,8,23 November 2018,"Warning...Spoilers
In 1984 I was a 11 year old kid. In 1985 I visited the U.S. and loved it visited Florida, New York and Disney World etc. The U.S. in the 1980s was an exciting place. With great movies, great music etc. In short it wasn't boring for a 11 year old kid. However after recently watching Batchelor Party. I only wish now that I was born five or six years earlier and was living in Los Angeles in 1984. Watching Batchelor Party, I am actually envious of the good times that those Los Angelinos in 1984 were having. What with hilarious friends, sexy attractive horny women. With Batchelor Party you see Los Angelino Tom Hanks character and his friends have one last party before he ties the knot. The Party is gate crashed by all types of Characters that make up the decadent Los Angeles society of the early to mid 1980s. Which adds to the hilarity as they engage in a no holds barred baccanalian sex romp party of debauchery in a Los Angeles hotel. Complete with hookers, booze, drugs and loud music and live bands. Who were actually pretty good.
Even though it was made in 1984. The humour of that era is actually funnier than the more serious cynical times we now live in. Everybody including the conservative middle class family of the bride of Tom Hanks character are having a riotous good time and we are too for two hours.
The movie doesn't take itself seriously, as it knows it is giving nothing more than two hours of inane entertainment as we peer into the lives for two hours sex crazed Los Angelinos throwing a big party as they celebrate their batchelor party while having sex with beautiful women.
I might buy this movie. A very entertaining movie. I only wished I was living in Los Angeles in 1984 and invited to a party like this and have as much good fun as these people did in Batchelor Party.",Bachelor Party
62,JunkieJoe,Romeo and Juliet.....?,7,12 April 2003,"If we could have known then, that Tom Hanks was going to be ""Tom Hanks""... (I recall watching the SAG awards tribute to Tom and they simply ignore the fact that he did this movie, too bad because it is   absolutely one of the coolest movies from the 80's.)A twisted Romeo and Juliet complete with guns, and drugs, and hookers, and beer... yes, something for everyone in Bachelor Party.  Any MAN that is married can relate to this movie.Bachelor Party has a good, workable cast, and a very funny story.  Hanks was at a great period in his career, a fresh face at the time, with good timing and delivery.  This is a ""guy"" movie all the way.  If you appreciate bathroom humor, this is a great flick; It is the bachelor party EVERY ONE OF US wanted to have!!",Bachelor Party
63,militon,"not exactly one of tom's best, but still",7,31 January 2006,"Far from being one of Tom Hank's best movies (as previously stated by a reviewer), this is still a very entertaining movie. I'm a fan of Tom's work. All of it. I love him, he's a great actor. Big is one of my favorite all time movies, as is Philadelphia. There seems to be nothing this man can't do, acting-wise that is. Back to this movie, while it may not be excellent, it still is very entertaining, and if you haven't seen it and are a fan of Tom (or just like over the top comedies), please go and rent it now. It will give a few good laughs (if it doesn't, blame me for the time you've lost watching it but i don't think that would be the case).",Bachelor Party
64,sogs,Brutal Crap!,1,18 March 2004,"I lived through the Eighties as a teenager and this film tries to pass itself off as a ""teen"" movie. Believe me when I say that the Eighties were nothing like this trollop! The actors excel themselves as being inane morons. Adrian Zmed must be the worst actor ever his awful undressing scene is sickening rot. He even attempts singing in this movie! It is dire! Hanks was always rubbish but he really shines as true garbage here. The so-called ""sex scenes"" are laughable to the point of extreme. The clothing and hairstyles are Eighties all right. The comedy is pure gutter trash and totally unfunny. Every new scene is worst than the last. Give it a miss! You will feel better for it.",Bachelor Party
65,trappjl,even for a dumb movie this is pretty dumb,4,12 May 2003,"While I can appreciate the fun 80s movie vibe trying to be achieved in Bachelor Party, it just doesn't cut. The movie is more loud and obnoxious then funny, and while the cast is allowed to over act, they over act just a little too much. Sorry Tom but this character and plot device just aren't good enough.",Bachelor Party
66,desertskies,Universal HD showed it a few minutes ago.,8,15 June 2008,"While striving to equate the movie to Animal House, I must admit it comes very close. The scene with the donkey eating the drugs and snorting the lines of coke, invoked the heart attack scene of the horse in Dean Wormer's office. The elevator scene confirmed it.Tom Hanks has come a long way from Bosom Buddies to Bachelor Party to Apollo 13, Saving Private Ryan and Cast Away. This movie shows one of his best comedic moments.While Adrian Zmed or Tawny Kitaens career didn't advance as far as Mr Hanks, they both made an impact in this movie. Wendie Jo Sperber was, well, Wendie Jo. May she RIP.If Bachelor Party isn't of cult status, I won't be upset, but I will be baffled.",Bachelor Party
67,jam-goldstein,Hilarious,8,14 September 2020,"This is Tom Hanks at his funniest. Even funnier than The Money Pit.

68,Chasey,Classic American eighties humour,10,13 October 1999,"I saw Bachelor Party for the first time in a long while last night - and I forgot just how funny it was.  If you like Porkys type Caddyshackesque humour, you must see this film!!Hanks is superb as the Bachelor boy who finds himself in a tug of love with his fiancee's ex boyfriend who would do anything to have her back before she gets hitched.  His friends throw him a party of a lifetime with booze drugs and hookers included which in turn leads to some memorable antics.  But not to be left out, the bride and her buddies are intent on having a good time too - all the time trying to resist the temptation to drop in on the Bachelor Party.....This is mid 1980's crass American comedy at its best, and the vastly underrated smooth operator Adrian Zmed turns in a great performance as Hanks best friend.Miss this film at your peril.....",Bachelor Party

73,fisherhifi,Favorite actress,10,19 August 2009,"What a bawdy wonderful reminder of my college days in San Diego. This film is funny, funny! Reminds me of the Lampoon style humor, which is my favorite. Who would have guessed at the time that Hanks would become so famous? I think I'll buy this DVD which I never do but this one should be kept around to loan to friends who've never seen it. It makes me wonder what kind of bachelor life the writers had. Makes me envy them. We use to head for Tijuana for bachelor parties in those days. My favorite character in the film was the girl with the donkey. How come she isn't in the cast list? How come the donkey isn't in the cast list (himself)? Is this racism?",Bachelor Party
74,Addivv,very bad movie,1,27 February 2003,hmmm... this is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't understand why it has such a relatively high rating. Maybe some people think it funny because it is so bad... but even that is not possible with this 'movie' in my opinion. The best I can say about it is that it is a continuous stream of VERY silly jokes. Don't watch this!,Bachelor Party

76,tenohtwo,A great comedy that deserves more credit,10,31 March 2004,"Tom Hanks' career began in comedy, and this film is a shining example of his comedic talents.  Hanks delivers a satisfying and enjoyable performance as groom-to-be Rick Gassko, and his supporting cast couldn't have been better selected.  Many of the film's co-stars had worked with Hanks in the past, most notably on TV's Bosom Buddies.  The chemistry is apparent here, as the actors are all very comfortable in their roles, as the dialogue is executed with a smooth, yet expedient wit.  The jokes all work in this film - outlandish as some of them may be.  There is never a dull moment in Bachelor Party, as each scene is well-constructed to deliver an inevitable laugh, without the premeditated one-liners that seem so forced in today's trash comedies. The events of the film were based on Producer Bob Israel's real life bachelor party experience, and the realism of the story can be felt in the film, as the viewer rarely has to suspend disbelief.  This movie can best be appreciated by the movie fan who enjoys witty, smirk-inducing comedies such as Porky's, Animal House, Police Academy, Summer School, and Weekend At Bernie's.",Bachelor Party
77,xmikex,Classic,7,10 September 2003,"A classic ""below the belt"" comedy. All the good things a mid 80's comedy needs. I'm sorry to see these kinds of movies not being made anymore. Hanks in his his prime, forget Saving Private Ryan.. this is the Hanks I wanna see.",Bachelor Party
78,R_Jentsch,Tom Hanks greatest work,10,13 June 2004,"I think this is one of the funniest movies in the history of comedy. Tom Hanks was a phenomenal comedian at one point in his career, and I would watch this over any of his other movies (even Mazes & Monsters). I don't know what I can say about this movie other than as long as you don't try to take it seriously, it will leave you in stitches for 2 hours, and if you are going to plan a bachelor party, this is your handbook.The general plot line is Tom Hanks is a blue collar worker (school bus driver for a Catholic School) as are most of his friends, but he falls in love with the rich girl, whose parent's can't stand there daughter dating an uneducated slob. Many of you will say that this plot has been seen numerous times, but this was the original comedy that did it, and did it best. If you haven't seen this movie, take the time to watch it, you don't know what you have been missing.",Bachelor Party

THAT was supposed to make the movie even more hysterical, but of course that would have changed the rating of the movie so it was cut out. I did wonder though if that was about to happen when I saw that seen for the first time! I mean, she was yanking so hard I thought the guy was going to fall over.

Now flash back to 1984, when movies were inane and entertaining--solely for entertaining!!! As far as raunchy 80's humor goes, you won't find anything better that Bachelor Party. Yes, the humor is predictable. Yes, the sight gags are predictable. But this movie does it better than anyone else in it's genre (that would be raunchy comedy). Good girl falls for bad boy, plan to get married, but first the guys must be guys. ""Let's have a party with liquor and drugs and guns and hookers and cops!"" and they do. Don't ask for more than this movie can deliver, yet appreciate it for what it is!",Bachelor Party
