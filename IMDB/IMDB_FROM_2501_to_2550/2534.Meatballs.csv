0,MartinHafer,Strictly for the 12-16 crowd.,6,15 November 2019,"""Meatballs"" is Bill Murry's first starring film and it did incredibly well at the box office...making about 35-40 times more than it cost to make! I never saw it back in the day, but probably should have as I was 15...the perfect age for the movie. Now, at 55, I'm too old...not nearly the target audience for the picture. And, I must add, that I've seen very few films with such a narrow age range that would enjoy the movie--probably only about 12-16. Older folks won't be all that impressed and younger ones probably won't understand a lot of the innuendos.The film is nearly plotless and follows a bunch of kids at Camp Northstar. And, on occasion, the camp battles its rich and spoiled neighboring summer camp. Some of the kids seem like real ones...but several are also one-dimensional and lazy stereotypes--such as 'Spaz' (the super-nerdy kid with tape all over his glasses) and the fat kid who walks around with a cooler filled with candy and other snacks.Some of this film is funny...some is disturbing. The funny mostly would appeal to younger folks and most adults would simply stare at the screen and wonder why they're watching it in the first place. The disturbing is both intentional and unintentional. The intentionally distubing stuff involves teen sexuality...though the film is not inappropriate THAT often...just occasionally. The unintentional stuff is because times have changed. Nice-guy Tripper (Murray) befriends a lonely 12 year-old (Chris Makepeace) and they spend a ton of time alone together...which was meant to be sweet. But today with a greater awareness of pedophilia, I could see people raising eyebrows. Sad.Overall, a film with only a few laughs but sure to please the right age group...and I'd rate it higher for them. All others....well, Murray has done many other wonderful films which should appeal to you much more.",Meatballs
1,Leofwine_draca,Rather sweet,6,13 August 2021,"One of the big American comedies of the era, this one charting the lives and loves of a number of camp councellors at a typical summer camp at the lake. This is far less raunchy and explicit than most similar teen sex comedies, and it's actually a surprise in that it turns out to be the heartwarming story of the relationship between a sweet guy and the awkward kid he befriends. It's notable for being Bill Murray's breakthrough cinematic debut and he's quietly wonderful in the part, stealing all of his scenes. The rest is moderately amusing and paints an affectionate picture of a different era.",Meatballs
2,SnoopyStyle,bringing Reitman and Murray together,6,7 December 2015,"It's a new summer at Camp North Star for kids from six to fourteen. Morty ""Mickey"" Melnick runs the camp and Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray) is the irreverent senior counselor. He keeps flirting with fellow lead counselor Roxanne. Spaz is one of the CITs (counselor in training). Rudy Gerner (Chris Makepeace) is a lonely kid who doesn't fit in. He and Tripper form a close connection. They have been beaten by neighboring Camp Mohawk for the last 12 years. In the annual competition, they are getting crashed by the cheating Camp Mohawk on the first day. They rally with Tripper's sarcastic chant ""It just doesn't matter.""This movie suffers from a lack of solid secondary actors. Murray is doing his utmost. He and Makepeace provide the heart. Spaz and his chubby friend have a few moments. Most of the rest are simply amateurs unable to deliver the jokes. For example, Roxanne needs to be either hot or funny. The actress is neither. Matt Craven is probably the only one out of that group who would go on to do more stuff. Director Ivan Reitman does his best with who he had. It's a small Canadian production that is most important for bringing together Reitman and Murray early in their careers. It's cute innocent fun.",Meatballs
3,mark.waltz,Not really much spice in this meatball.,5,13 September 2017,"Ah yes, the years of summer camp. Intermingling with kids from other schools and being lead around by adults you pray you'll never see again. Ridiculous activities designed to test your exuberance and stupid prizes that end up in the trash as soon as mom and dad see them. This coming of age comedy explores all that, adding in the twist of some of the camp counselors being high school students and their efforts to get laid over the summer.Not quite leading the group is Bill Murray in his film debut, combining his trade work silliness and mentoring a pre-teen kid desperate to fit in. Murray may be the only name star in this film, but there's interesting casting for the typical archetypes you see in pretty much every film like this. Harvey Atkin, a veteran actor I've never heard of, plays the much put upon and harassed camp head, the way too serious older man, perfectly fitting the description of camp worker that I prayed I'd never see again.At times, the film becomes a touching memory of the style of Saturday matinée I grew up with, combining the fads and attitudes of my high school years, the perfect summer movie. Some of these characters might not be relatable to younger generations due to changes in acceptable cultural behaviors. I would like to have seen more moments between Murray and the sensitive young kid, and less focus on the overly hormoned teens. More exploration of the great outdoors would have opened up possible laughs at the expense of these slobs dealing with nature.",Meatballs
4,gavin6942,"Not the Greatest, But a Predecessor, If You Will",6,25 January 2011,"So, this film is not the funniest or the best directed or the film with the most stars or hot teenagers running around... the late 1970s were an awkward time.Here is how to approach this film: as a predecessor to other films, notably ""Ghostbusters"". This was Bill Murray's first starring role, it was partially written by Harold Ramis and directed by Ivan Reitman. Five years later, this same combination would bring us the best horror-comedy of the 1980s.Beyond that, I do not know what to say... it is a decent film, a fun film. Maybe it has no real merit, and maybe summer camp was never like this -- have you ever even been to a summer camp? But a good film.",Meatballs
5,lee_eisenberg,"meat's meat, and man's gotta eat...or rather, man's gotta watch ""Meatballs""",10,15 September 2006,"Once upon a time, Bill Murray didn't play serious roles, just goofy ones. ""Meatballs"" is one of the best, funniest examples. It's basically and hour and a half of complete silliness, with Murray as a counselor at a Canadian summer camp. If the movie has any problem, it's that the movie spawned a seemingly infinite number of movies about summer camps - and a lot of those were about kids trying to save their summer camps. But anyway, this one is a real hoot, especially what results from Murray's telling of the hook-handed-killer-tries-to-attack-teenagers urban legend. And of course, director Ivan Reitman later directed Murray in ""Stripes"" and the ""Ghostbusters"" movie (unfortunately, Reitman later backed Arnold Schwarzenegger for governor). A really fun romp.I wonder what ever became of Chris Makepeace.",Meatballs
6,Woodyanders,A delightfully sprightly and zany hoot,8,10 July 2009,"Wildman head counselor Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray in peak nutty form in his first lead role) presides over the various wacky hi-jinks at North Star summercamp. Tripper befriends sad and lonely misfit kid Rudy (a nice and affecting performance by Chris Makepeace). Director Ivan Reitman relates the amusingly off the wall comic vignettes at a ceaseless snappy pace and maintains an engagingly good-natured tone throughout. This film astutely nails the breezy'n'breezy essence of summer: making friends, first love, pulling pranks, competing in sports with a rival camp, campfire singalongs, and, of course, the inevitable scary urban legend about the escaped psycho killer with the hook hand. The sense of gleefully raucous fun this picture generates is positively infectious. Moreover, the humor is always goofy and occasionally gross, but never too nasty or mean-spirited. Best of all, there's a winning surplus of pure heart to go along with said humor (the warm relationship between Tripper and Rudy in particular is genuinely touching). The cast have an obvious ball playing their likable characters: Murray's gloriously gonzo and galvanizing presence keeps things constantly humming (his crazy PA announcements are absolutely sidesplitting), plus there are sound contributions from Harvey Atkin as hapless camp owner Morty, Kate Lynch as Tripper's sassy old flame Roxanne, Russ Banham as the amiable Crockett, Kristine DeBell as the sweet, foxy A.L., Sarah Torgov as the feisty Candace, Jack Blum as klutzy bespectacled nerd Spaz, Keith Knight as tubby slob Larry Finkelstein, Cindy Girling as the fetching Wendy, and Matt Craven as the hip Hardware. Donald Wilder's cinematography gives the movie an attractive sunny look and makes nifty use of wipes. Elmer Bernstein's lively and melodic score likewise does the trick. A real riot.",Meatballs
7,paul_haakonsen,Mediocre at best...,3,17 September 2019,"Alright, well oddly enough I have never seen or heard about ""Meatballs"" before this late in 2019. I stumbled upon the movie by sheer chance, picked up the DVD and saw that Bill Murray was in it, and it looked like a typical comedy, so of course I sat down to watch it.""Meatballs"" wasn't really a movie that brought about any laughs for me. Sure, the movie was watchable, but it was just lacking something fundamental to make it interesting and enjoyable for me. Perhaps it was because of the humor that was to be found throughout the course of the movie, it just didn't really appeal to me. And I also found the movie to be a bit too generic and not really standing out from other similar comedies.This 1979 movie was hardly the brightest moment in the career of Bill Murray, but he does add to the movie with his usual charm and goofball demeanor.For a comedy, then I found ""Meatballs"" to be a bit too generic and just lacking contents to make it a worthwhile movie. And while I did manage to sit through the entire movie, then it is hardly a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time.My rating of ""Meatballs"" is a very generic and less than mediocre three out of ten stars. There are far better late teenage comedies readily available out there.",Meatballs
8,tavm,Meatballs was a wonderful initial starring showcase for Bill Murray,8,28 June 2010,"A year after John Belushi hit it big in the movies with Animal House, fellow SNLer Bill Murray would do the same with Meatballs with help from director Ivan Reitman-who was a producer on AH-and that film's co-writer Harold Ramis. Also from the Belushi picture was music composer Elmer Bernstein who would provide scores for other Reitman/Murray/Ramis movies like Stripes and Ghostbusters. Anyway, Murray provides great laughs with his charismatic wild-man persona as a camp counselor who helps a shy young boy (Chris Makepace) get out of his shell and a fellow female staff member (Kate Lynch) fall for him. Another staff member is Morty (Harvey Atkin) who falls victim to many of Bill's practical jokes. Then there's Spaz (Jack Blum, brother of the movie's co-writer Len Blum) and his buddy Fink (Keith Knight) who provide a touchingly humorous nerd-&-tubby vibe. There's also some sex appeal in the person of Wendy (Cindy Girling) and a girl-next-door one in A.L. (Kristine DeBell though she's probably best known for being Alice in the X-rated version of Alice in Wonderland). In other words, there's a nice mix of one-liners, slapstick, and sentimentality though it doesn't go overboard on the latter. Not everything works but Meatballs is still-all these years later-a good comedy worth watching especially for the first starring role of Bill Murray. Oh, how I loved hearing ""Spaz! Spaz! ""Spaz!"" and ""It just doesn't matter!"" once again...",Meatballs
9,wes-connors,Are You Ready for the Slumber?,5,20 June 2011,"Canada's ""Camp North Star"" is the setting for summer fun. In the opening scene, groggy camp counselor Bill Murray (as Tripper Harrison) doesn't seem up for the job. He perks up fast when the new crop of school-aged kids arrive. The main co-star is sensitive Chris Makepeace (as Rudy Gerner), a lonely boy who may bond with Mr. Murray before the closing credits. Otherwise, we focus on ""the CITs"" (counselors-in-training). A lot of youthful co-ed skin (but no nudity) mixed with sex talk (but no action) made ""Meatballs"" a safe hit at the box office. Later camp films lowered the bar.***** Meatballs (6/28/79) Ivan Reitman ~ Bill Murray, Chris Makepeace, Kate Lynch, Russ Banham",Meatballs
10,BandSAboutMovies,Are you ready for the summer?,8,10 April 2019,"After appearing on The National Lampoon Radio Hour and several seasons of Saturday Night Live, Bill Murray was poised for stardom. This is but the first of the many starring roles he'd gift us with over the years. His role as camp counselor Tripper Harrison is basically him playing the role of Bill Murray, an exaggerated version of himself, that he'd been doing on SNL for some time.The first of four films that Murray would make with director Ivan Reitman, this is pretty much one of the ultimate hijinks ensue films. That's my theory of what makes an imminently watchable film: start with a simple concept, create some great characters, place them into some funny situations and let the hijinks ensue.This is also the first of six collaborations between Murray and writer Harold Ramis. Incredibly, Ramis claimed in interviews that he and Reitman had no idea if Murray was going to be in Meatballs until he showed up for the first day of shooting.This was also the first movie that Ramis wrote after Animal House. Originally, Reitman was going to produce and that film's director, John Landis, was also going to work on Meatballs. He decided to do The Blues Brothers, so Reitman decided to direct.Harrison (Murray) is in charge of the counselors and kids of the cheapskate Camp North Star, which has never defeated the rich Mowhawk in twelve years of Summer Camp Olympiad competition. There's young love, pranks and Murray's continual camp announcements, so many of which were part of my childhood and teen years as our local radio station WDVE played them for years.The film's best segment is Harrison rallying the troops to win the big game with a speech that seems to go nowhere. ""And even if we win, if we win, HAH! Even if we win! Even if we play so far above our heads that our noses bleed for a week to ten days; even if God in Heaven above comes down and points his hand at our side of the field; even if every man woman and child held hands together and prayed for us to win, it just wouldn't matter because all the really good looking girls would still go out with the guys from Mohawk because they've got all the money! It just doesn't matter if we win or we lose. IT JUST DOESN'T MATTER!""Five years later, Meatballs Part II would be released, which has no connection to this film but does have an alien named Meathead. Meatballs III: Summer Job catches up with Rudy, played here by Patrick Dempsey instead of Chris Makepeace. This time out, he's haunted by the ghost of Roxy Doujor (Sally Kellerman), an adult film star who can't get into Heaven until she helps Rudy lose his virginity. Finally, the movie Happy Campers became Meatballs 4, bringing together Corey Feldman, Sarah Douglas (Ursa in the Superman movies) and Eraserhead star Jack Nance.Finally, some interesting Reitman and Murray trivia. In the early 1980's, Tom Mankiewicz (the writer of Live and Let Die, The Man with the Golden Gun, Superman and Ladyhawke, as well as the director of Dragnet and the creative consultant for TV's Hart to Hart) wrote a script called The Batman. Reitman would have directed, with Murray has Batman, David Niven as Alfred Pennyworth, William Holden as Commissioner James Gordon, and singer David Bowie as The Joker. After Reitman left the project, Joe Dante took over but nothing ever happened. Most interestingly, this movie would have been based on the Steve Englehart/Marshall Rogers/Terry Austin run of the comic.",Meatballs
11,Scarecrow-88,Meatballs,8,23 June 2007,"Camp North Star and it's Camp counselor extraordinaire, Tripper Harrison(Bill Murray)sure would like to end a decades long losing streak to rival Camp Mohawk, an ivy league type place where only the wealthy kids can attend. Meanwhile, we watch as Tripper tries his hand at love when he flirts aimlessly with fellow female counselor Roxanne(Kate Lynch)as other teen counselors pair up and also fall head-over-heels. The film comes to head at the Camp Olympiad as the rivals square off in competitive athletic contests with Tripper almost realizing their doomed to fail yet another year. The film also shows the growing bond between Tripper and a quietly lonely, puppy-dog eyed Rudy(Chris Makepeace of ""Vamp"" fame), whose dad is often away all the time. Rudy doesn't seem to fit in with the other kids his age and he seems to spend most of his time either jogging in the mornings with Tripper or taking his peanuts at Blackjack. The film mostly contains hi-jinx of fellow teen camp counselors cutting up and goofing around.You have hottie counselors, total nerd Spaz(Jack Blum)with his taped glasses and bad acne, beak-nosed ""Hardware""(Matt Craven)who likes to blow things up, fat kid Fink(Keith Knight) who is often stuffing his face, amongst others in the film. There's a basketball game where poor Spaz can barely bounce the ball against rival Camp Mohawk much less shoot an accurate shot with poor Fink tossing underhanded, between-his-knees fly-balls that sail over the back-board. There's camp fire coupling(with a spirited scary tale by Tripper about a hook-handed killer)and boys drooling over the lovely ladies.Yes, I know it's desperate at times trying to squeeze out every laugh it can and occasionally indulges in lapses of sentimentality(such as the scenes with a sad Makepeace and Murray), but just as much as this recent viewing, I found myself giggling away. I'm licked and just can't help loving this. It's a summer camp movie through and through which simply wants to entertain you. I can't explain, or reinforce enough, the overwhelming joy that floods forth when I see a sleepy Murray's hand reach from the covers for the alarm clock that's piercing loudly pronouncing a summer camp movie is about to begin. His intercom jokes are especially amusing. But, the flick is, let's be honest, a series of comic vignettes with Murray dead-panning endlessly..not that there's anything wrong with that. The film, though, couldn't quite survive without him, could it? Hard to even think of this movie without Murray in the lead. It's a happier time and I think nostalgia of that summer camp experience plays quite a hand in why we grown-ups still connect with ""Meatballs"" warmly. And, poor Morty(Harvey Atkin), the camp head who so badly wants things to run smooth, and to beat Camp Mohawk for a change, is the constant source of Tripper and gang's amusement as they often play gags on him..especially when he's sleeping on his bed! Great enthusiastic cast who seem to be having as much as us.",Meatballs
12,Hey_Sweden,"The kids are brats, and the food is hideous...",8,13 July 2013,"""Meatballs"" does pretty well at milking laughs out of a rite of passage for many American people, the summer camp experience. True that the script isn't anything great, this functions on an often juvenile level, and not all of the jokes are terribly funny, but it works because of a basic likability. This viewer thought it was pretty harmless. Maybe in the scenes between Tripper and Rudy does it get too maudlin, but these scenes are effective at humanizing the Tripper character. Overall, it's a solid vehicle for SNL star Bill Murray, making the most of his first lead role. It's hard not to laugh at some of his morning announcements, the TV interview, and his big show stopping ""It just doesn't matter!"" speech.Murray plays Tripper, the head counselor at Camp North Star, a man with a wacky approach to life. There's not much of a story here (screenplay credit goes to Len Blum, Daniel Goldberg, Janis Allen, and Harold Ramis), but among the antics are the pranks Tripper and his fellow counselors (among them, Jack Blum (""Happy Birthday to Me""), Keith Knight (""My Bloody Valentine""), and Matt Craven (""Crimson Tide"")) play on camp director Morty (Harvey Atkin), Tripper reaching out to a shy and lonely young camper, Rudy (Chris Makepeace, ""My Bodyguard"") who just wants to make friends, and the final Olympiad where Camp North Star competes with the more macho and aggressive Camp Mohawk youngsters.It's not too hard to identify with many of these characters, especially during their more awkward moments. By the end you really are rooting for them, and are enjoying the big finale involving a race through the woods.In addition to Murray, the rest of the cast does well, with Kate Lynch able to hold her own opposite the comedy star, playing the object of his affections. The lovely Kristine De Bell also appears as one of the counselors.Best of all, director Ivan Reitman keeps the gags coming right through the end credits.Overall, this is good natured fun and something that I can't believe anybody would hate.Eight out of 10.",Meatballs
13,preppy-3,Predictable summer camp comedy,3,17 August 2007,"Completely ordinary movie about an exclusive camp called Camp Mohawk. The program director Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray) provides most of the ""comedy"" as we see predictable PG rated shenanigans of the kids. We also get two violent, unfunny and stupid games with rival camps. To make it worse they throw in yawningly predictable romances and Murray helping a young kid (Chris Makepeace) come out of his shell.For some reason this was a huge hit and made Murray a star. I can't see why--I didn't even smile, let alone laugh, once. None of the bits are funny--just boring or raunchy (in a PG way). Murray's pronouncements over the camp's loudspeaker are eye-rollingly bad. In fact I never liked Murray. He's just not funny! This isn't a total washout. It was well-done and the acting (Murray aside) was pretty good. Kate Lynch especially was good. Also the good song played at the camp social--""Makin' It""--was later used as the theme song of a similar named TV series. For this I give it a 3 but it just wasn't funny at all. If you like Murray you probably will like this. If not, stay away. Give me ""Little Darlings"" over this any day.",Meatballs
14,view_and_review,Weakballs,2,22 November 2019,"It's a summer camp movie so what does that mean? Horny teens looking to get laid. They did throw in an adult with the same mindset (Bill Murray).That's the one constant, but the variables are:A.) They can have sex and Jason Voorhese can kill them all.B.) They can have sex and do funny wacky pranks.This movie was option B. It was rated PG so even though there was talk abound about making out, scoring, getting laid, etc. they never showed anything beyond kissing and bikini clad girls.Bill Murray did his best John Belushi Animal House impression as he acted wacky for laughs. That included aggressively pursuing a girl, several sexual jokes, and other absurd behavior. In other words, not Murray at is best.",Meatballs
15,Uriah43,One of the Better Juvenile Camp Comedies Prevalent During this Pariticular Time-Period,6,9 October 2020,"This film begins at an economical summer camp known as Camp North Star which has a practical joker by the name of ""Tripper"" (Bill Murray) as its head counselor. As a result the entire environment of those in the camp is both relaxed and fun-which the kids pick up on right away. This is especially important since Camp North Star doesn't have the immense resources of its nearby rival Camp Mohawk which hosts a physical competition between the two of them every year. To that effect, the counselors try their best to keep the kids actively engaged in athletics and it's at this time that Tripper notices one extremely shy young lad by the name of ""Rudy"" (Chris Makepeace) who seems to be having a difficult time fitting in with the others due to his unfamiliarity with sports in general. Since none of the other kids will have anything to do with him Tripper decides to befriend him and--little by little--Rudy begins to come out of his shell. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was one of the better juvenile camp comedies which were prevalent during this particular time-period with the acting of Bill Murray as a major factor. Likewise, the fact that it was so commercially successful led to three sequels-none of which were nearly as good. In any case, while not a great comedy by any means, this film had its moments and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Meatballs
16,AaronCapenBanner,It Just Doesn't Matter!,7,3 September 2013,"Nostalgic and funny comedy has Bill Murray playing Tripper, a wacky summer camp counselor who, when he isn't trying to romance all the female counselors, is trying to help a sad boy(Chris Makepeace) who doesn't want to be there, and who isn't popular. Also features other assorted characters like ""Spaz"" for instance. Then there is the rival summer camp where the rich kids go, and whom Tripper badly wants to show up.This could have been just another crass, predictable comedy, but this has a surprising amount of heart and empathy, and by the end, you may get just as misty eyed about it being over as the campers! Of course, all the viewer has to do is replay the DVD.",Meatballs
17,movieman_kev,Murray saves it,6,26 May 2005,"A typical summer camp film with the prerequisite fat guy, nerd, hot girl and the corny but fun-spirited song is saved by Bill Murray as Tripper Harrison the head counselor, making this film humorously enjoyable, if not laugh out loud funny. Not Murray best movie by a long shot, but an enjoyable enough time waster. Sadly Kristine DeBell who happily showed everything in the mid-70's sleaze classic ""Alice in Wonderland"" (tis a pity, trust me) Followed by three dire sequels, with the bottom of the barrel being the 'meatball' the alien starring ""Meatballs 2"" My Grade: C+",Meatballs
18,Aaron1375,Would set the tone for most summer camp movies to follow.,7,12 April 2009,"I liked this movie for the most part, but have to say had there been anyone else besides Bill Murray in the lead role it would not have been as good. He brings an energy to the role that steps this film up a notch than it would have been otherwise. I mainly enjoyed the pranks pulled on the one counselor and there are other humorous things in this movie too such as the hot dog eating contest. This movie would also set the stage for summer camp movies with the competition at the end. Nearly every camp movie has either this or the unruly or troubled kids plot, or a combination of both. This series also would take a rather strange shift in tone as this one and two are both family friendly movies while part three and four are more adult oriented, more like the old teen sex comedies of the time. It kind of did the opposite of the Police Academy movies that went from R to PG-13 to PG movies. This series goes from the opposite to R. Still this first one and only good one is worth some chuckles largely due to Bill Murray.",Meatballs
19,Wuchakk,Amusing and harmless misadventures at summer camp with Bill Murray,7,7 October 2018,"Bill Murray (who was 28 during shooting) stars as an eccentrically droll camp counselor at Camp North Star who ""trains"" CITs, counselors-in-training, as they oversee the hordes of kids and face challenges with teams from preppy Camp Mohawk.""Meatballs"" (1979) is a fun and innocuous summer camp flick. It's not great but it's entertaining enough, although if I'm going to view a summer camp film I prefer the Friday the 13th movies (practically any of them), mainly because they feature superior women. Here, Cindy Girling as curvy blonde Wendy is by far the most alluring, although Sarah Torgov as Candace is decent.In light of the license plates, the camp is presumably located in upstate New York, but was shot in Camp White Pine, Haliburton, Ontario, which is only about 125 miles from the New York border.The movie runs 1 hour, 34 minutes.GRADE: B/B-",Meatballs

21,GOWBTW,Summer camp has never been more fun!,10,1 September 2008,"Imagine spending the summer without your family or friends from school, and meeting new people. Or yet, it's your first time where you're a nobody and the only person you can count on is somebody from camp. ""Meatballs"" packs lots of comedy in this film. In camp, there's a eccentric counselor(Bill Murray) who knows how the boys and girls can have a good time. Enter a kid named Rudy(Chris Makepeace) who has no one to look up to. He doesn't fit in with anyone, only Tripper can make him have fun. The rest of the can are just as crazy as Tripper. Camp Northstar is an average camp with an above average team. One the other hand Camp Mohawk is an elite camp that has them running for their money. In the basketball game, the Mohawks got pantsed! And in the Olympiad the Northstar teal got the revenge they needed when one of the members take out the saboteur. And Morty(Harvey Atkin), this poor soul can never get himself in gear if he tried. A very, VERY funny comedy, and it's a big keeper I'll say. This movie shows that camp can be fun, if you wanted to be! 5 stars!",Meatballs
22,hellraiser7,Wacky Camp,9,29 July 2018,"This is another childhood gem of mine, it's probably number 9 in the vacation comedy subgenre since it kind of falls into that category, it takes place at a summer camp, so it counts. This is one of those film I like to watch as summer is starting up or sometimes around the other seasons, so I can remember summer time and the good times at that time or remind myself it's not that far off. What made it unique at the time was that it was a comedy that was focused on summer camp which we never really had at the time. This film defiantly got the camp comedy genre going as afterward there have been numerous others that have followed and might have been a partial inspiration to the TV show ""Salute your Shorts"".This film in a way is kind of like ""Animal House"" but in summer camp as Camp NorthStar seems to consist of the rag tag bunch which I like because that kind of group is health as it consists of people that are all unique and real community. What I really like about most of the cast in this film are they all look like ordinary everyday people so you're not going to spot anyone from the CW around. This I feel gives the film feel grounded in reality and really helps the relatability factor. This film also in a way is sort of like a journal as we watch it we can easily recall some of our past times when we gone to camp, from seeing some of these characters engage in a wild antic or two or even the games that camps engage in, just a lot of things that really bring you back.The only bad thing about the film is lack of a solid memorable ensemble which I felt the film could have benefited from even more. Not many characters really stand out, they're not bad there are a few that are memorable like Spaz and Fink both are a good comic duo, there is a good back and forth. Kate Lynch she was alright as Roxanne whom is Tripp's significant other and was someone that was trying to keep things running right. Harvey Atkin as Morty whom sort of looks like Groucho Marx is always getting his authority undermined and Tripp and the rest of the colorful councilors they play some pranks on him to give him grief.To me the character that really stands out and I also feel really drives this film is Bill Murray as Tripp. This film was practically his debut in the lead role and it was a good start as it really shows his comedic chops, which he does so flawlessly well. I really like that his character is one that doesn't like or want to follow the rules except his own. He really does care about the people in the camp and want them along with himself to simply have a good time which is what summer camps were built for anyway. However, one other thing I like about him is he never wants anyone to feel down.There is this little plotline on the rivalry with Camp Mohawk which are supposedly the camp that is better and higher up, which also means it's jerk central. There is a scene where camp is playing Basketball against Mohawk, I wouldn't really call it a game it was more like a massacre as most of the personal in camp lets just say make novices in the game look like champs, it's sad but true; however despite their losing dilemma Tripp doesn't let this get them down as they all let's just say made Basketball history.There are lots of great memorable scenes like Tripp telling an urban legend on the campfire which I'll admit got me going for a while, it was just a good scene on build up and pay off. The dance social seeing him do some dance moves which he improvised. And of course, there is the inspirational speech scene which you have to see for yourself Bill is just at his best in that one.
Like any good summer camp this is a film worth visiting.Rating: 3 and a half stars",Meatballs
23,jimbo-53-186511,Bill Murray is great but his performance alone isn't enough to carry this plot less and laugh-free shambles,2,9 September 2016,"Having just watched Meatballs I was struggling to decipher what this film was trying to be or what it was trying to say; clearly it has a coming-of-age aspect to its story, but it's given very little focus or development. It's also clearly a film about the trials and tribulations of a bunch of youths whilst they're at a summer camp whilst they are being mentored by their crazy leader Tripper (Bill Murray).The problem with this film is that it has no definitive structure and no coherent plot line; it moves from scene to scene and from person to person but never in a way where it feels as though a story is being told - it felt like I was watching a series of goofball sketches lazily edited together rather than an actual story. Up until about the 60 minute mark the film doesn't seem to have any kind of point (although to be fair it does establish one in its final third) but to be honest I found myself kind of bored; nearly all of the characters are boring clichés that unfortunately remain this way throughout the film - there never seems to be any revealing moments or irony with any of these characters making them feel rather dull and one-dimensional.There is one interesting aspect of the story (involving the bond between Rudy and Tripper) which is quite endearing, but it's never really given the attention that it deserves and sadly Reitman seems more interested in creating several chaotic and random moments which never seem to manifest themselves into any kind of story and many of these moments seemed to serve little purpose.When I looked at this film I was actually hoping that it would be similar to Animal House but the thing with Animal House is that it was silly but funny whereas Meatballs is silly without being funny and that's the key difference. There were no big laughs on offer at all and very few small laughs (the only thing I found mildly amusing was the scene where they strap Monty to his bed and leave him outside strapped to the bed overnight).One thing that is great about this film is Bill Murray and he does bring this dreck to the life whenever he is on screen. Granted he does overact occasionally, but in fairness he probably felt obliged to because nobody else seemed to be making much of an effort.The film has a nice feel good ending to it (albeit a predictable one), but truthfully Meatballs isn't a particularly fun film to sit through and its 'Are you ready for the summer' theme song is pretty annoying as well.",Meatballs
24,RavenGlamDVDCollector,stick to the poster,3,9 November 2019,"If you are a guy and can find the poster, the poster is a hundred times more fun than this movie. That says it all.

25,slokes,Easy summer fling,6,20 October 2003,"Between Peter Sellers and Eddie Murphy, you have to mention Bill Murray when you talk about filmdom's best comics. He doesn't have the range or talent of either Sellers or Murphy, but Murray has better taste in scripts and a stronger core comedic persona, that being the flip, slightly askew, occasional drooly fellow who debuts here, in Murray's first film.""Meatballs"" is not sophisticated, it plays to the conventions of its period with routine sex jokes and raunchiness that (for 1979) stays just where it needs to be to avoid an R rating, but it does amuse. There's a dozen lines worth quoting as the film zips along, switching gears nicely from scene to scene. Brainless, yes, but not as stupid as ""Stripes"" or as boorishly snide as ""Caddyshack."" Discarding the experimental ""Where The Buffalo Roam"" and ""Tootsie,"" where Murray's role is minor, I'll say ""Meatballs"" was not only a solid debut feature but Murray's best film all the way through to ""Ghostbusters.""The best thing about ""Meatballs"" is it lets Murray be Murray, and he doesn't disappoint, running the film from front to back with his goofy ramblings, even sticking himself into the soundtrack during the Olympiad sequence (where he can be heard scatting phrases like ""communist nymphomania"" and suchlike.) He has many killer moments, like his ""just doesn't matter"" rant and his sideline pep talk during the basketball game. Even his tiniest asides are funny, even when they aren't witty, because his delivery is so on. Obviously he had something to prove back then, and this film benefits a lot from that.Would it be worth watching if Steve Guttenberg was playing Trip? I don't know. ""Meatballs"" comes across at times as an ensemble film, but Murray has all the good lines, all but Fink's earnest congratulations to Spaz (""you old make-out artist"") after Spaz holds a girl's hand for a couple of minutes. Still, the rest of the cast has energy and play off each other well. I liked the little I saw of them. If they never had any recognizable post-film career outside Canada (i.e. no film career period), they display solid charisma. Perhaps director Ivan Reitman should have showcased them more, but credit him with getting an improvisational feel to their line readings atypical for this sort of film. Even the fact they're not movie-star attractive isn't a negative. You accept them as ordinary people, the kind you might enjoy spending a summer with.The Rudy Gurnier subplot is odd. Maybe it's just me, but Chris Makepeace, who looks like Karen Black mated with the guy who played Scorpio in ""Dirty Harry,"" gives off a too-creepy vibe. Even with that, his character might be worth more attention if the film wasn't just about getting laughs. But he's merely there to give Murray some time to develop his human side, and the touchy-feely subplot feels pasted on. Doesn't Trip know giving a camper special attention like that will make him more of a target for cabin abuse?Morty the camp director is annoying whether or not he's the victim of ridiculous pranks, and the soundtrack tends to grate (though I think it's supposed to, as with ""Are You Ready For The Summer?""). But ""Meatballs"" is funny, and it deserves extra credit for being such a nice introduction to Bill Murray the movie star. Love those Hawaiian shirts, and his PA announcement helmet. And lines like his one about sending Mohawk kids off with $2,000 cash and a thermos of coffee for ""Sexual Awareness Week."" Sometimes you just have to laugh.",Meatballs
26,Sandcooler,Are you ready for the summmeeeeeeeeeer,7,12 April 2013,"""Meatballs"" is the ""Citizen Kane"" of cheesy summer camp comedies, and you can interpret that any way you want to. Every cliché you know and love about this sub-genre originated right here. The good wholesome camp having to compete against a cheating camp: it's in here. The rebel camp counselor who's constantly playing pranks and for some reason always looks at least 10 years too old for the part: ""Meatballs"" did it first. The hapless geeks that get to do something heroic before the credits roll: well that had probably been done before, but ""Meatballs"" does is very well too. Is ""Meatballs"" actually good? Probably not, but it does fill you with a sort of nostalgic feeling to whenever the hell people thought wearing those shorts was a good idea. And it's pretty funny too, particularly all the absurd stuff Bill Murray says over the intercom. Some characters are very bland and could have been written out altogether (I would call them by their names if I remembered them), but the whole Tripper/Rudy dynamic is actually done very well and really makes the movie stand out among its countless copies. One thing though: anyone know how I get that goddamn soundtrack out of my head?",Meatballs
27,MartianOctocretr5,Summer Camp Shenanigans,9,13 January 2006,"This is easily the best of the summer camp movies. In fact, few of the others are even fair, let alone anywhere near as entertaining as this one is. The film is just simply out to have some good, clean, fun. Many people who went to summer camp as kids will see that it is presented here faithfully to the way it usually was, but with slapstick comedy mixed in. Bill Murray, as the chief counselor of the camp, Tripper, leads a fine ensemble cast, and is usually at the center of the riotous nonsense. Tripper has great one-liners throughout, usually broadcasting his jokes as pseudo-announcements over the camp's public-address system.Several great supporting actors played the campers and counselors to build a myriad of fun and interesting subplots, all the while sprinkled amongst the many incidents of camp hi-jinx. Spaz (Jack Blum) and Fink (Keith Knight) were two characters particularly well done. The adventures (and misadventures) of these two are hilarious. Each has classic lines, and they are characters you like and root for. Look for Spaz in the scene of disco dance pandemonium.The girls in the story are realistic characters, too. They're not dumb, naive, freakish, oversexed, nervy, or any of the other overused, abominable teen character stereotypes. Kristine DeBell, Kate Lynch, Cindy Girling, and others make these characters believable. The requisite pranks abound, usually at the expense of camp director Morty (Harvey Atkin). The nature of these pranks start at outrageous and progress from there. However, with all the silliness going on, Tripper and the others have their serious sides. For example, Tripper befriends a shy, lonely kid, Rudy(Chris Makepeace), and takes him under his wing.The story culminates with a sports competition against a rival camp. It's a great ""root for the underdogs"" finale. When the chips are down, Tripper's motivational ""It just doesn't matter"" spiel is inspired, and one of the best moments in the movie. And get ready to root: ""Spaz. Spaz! Spaz!!!""""",Meatballs
28,Howlin Wolf,"It's a simple enough dish, but it tastes good...",7,23 May 2007,"... The reason I like this movie so much is because of the spirit it has. It's a genial summer camp movie, so the jokes aren't mean minded in a lasting way that makes one character the permanent butt of ridicule. Pranks do take place, but you get the feeling that the respective fall-guys would be able to look back and laugh, having been dopey enough to fall for them - and without being too cheesy, it's actually kinda nice that everyone still remains friends in the end!It's an extra special bonus when the ringmaster of all these jolly japes is Bill Murray. For me, he's still looked upon as the comedy god without peer when he gets a chance to cut loose. No one's better at generating a sense of freewheeling wacky anarchy without really hurting anyone. The tone of the entire film has the same style as its leading man, established with a great opening scene showing the Murray way of getting ready for the day. Everything's silly, yes, but more important than behaving like an adult is to have a whole lot of good-natured fun. ""Meatballs"" promises such and ultimately delivers a nourishing watch.",Meatballs
29,sarastro7,"Nice setup, but doesn't quite deliver",5,18 December 2006,"I am a huge fan of Bill Murray, but Meatballs is not in league with classics like Ghostbusters or even Scrooged. The idea of having a racy comedy set in a kids' summer camp is not bad, but the great gags never really materialize. For one thing, the movie is too short; barely an hour and a half. Maybe if there were an extended cut with an extra half hour things would turn out better.The plot element with the inter-camp olympiad that takes up more than half the movie is not that interesting. I just wanted more old-fashioned gags and cool one-liners. As summer camp comedies go, this one is inferior to Addams Family Values, which is much stronger in every area, including as a political satire.Meatballs can be rated no higher than a 5 out of 10.",Meatballs

31,TOMASBBloodhound,Murray makes it work.,8,17 June 2007,"Luckily for Bill Murray this is such a light-weight project since he pretty much has to carry it. Meatballs is the story of low-rent Camp Northstar and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another. Then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named Camp Mohawk which culminates in a two-day Olympiad competition. Above it all is Bill Murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut.The film is sprinkled with medium-sized laughs, chuckles, and more than a few guffaws along the way. The biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director. Three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while he's sleeping. Morty, or ""Micky"" as everyone calls him, wakes up along the side of a road, strung up in some trees several feet above the ground, and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake! There are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another, but this is a PG rated film with little in the way of raunchiness.The film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named Rudy who is played by Chris Makepeace. Of course it's up to Murray to teach the kid how to open up, and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the Olympiad. The sentimentality of Rudy's situation seems tacked on to a great degree. Notice how when Murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him, ""you must be the short depressed kid we ordered."" Makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or Murray was just ad-libbing while the cameras were rolling. In other words, Murray might as well have said to Makepeace, ""you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesn't fit in."" But before it's all over, Murray's performance makes this plot device more than bearable. He really seems to have some good chemistry with Makepeace.The film culminates with the games between the two rival camps. Very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable, but ""it just doesn't matter"". This is a pretty good film on many levels. Don't let the absurd 5.6 rating this film is currently getting scare you off. Murray will keep you laughing throughout. Just be warned..... avoid the sequels!!!! Especially the one with Corey Feldman!! 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Meatballs

Time has not been kind to this one. It even tries to be sentimental at times, which also fails. I realize that this comment will probably be placed near the bottom, because whenever I write a negative comment it always gets voted as ""not helpful"" which is understandable I guess.

Meatballs, a summer camp 'romp' starring Bill Murray and directed by Ivan Reitman, is a complete waste of time. It takes a considerable effort for four screenwriters to produce a movie (the word 'comedy' infers a work with mirth aforethought) as witless, anaemic and boring as this.Murray evidently reached the same conclusion during filming, but his usually reliable powers of improvisation escape him and his flailing attempts to inject life into proceedings just add to the embarrassment - the ""It really doesn't matter"" chanting scene is excruciating. It doesn't help that the supporting cast is bereft of talent - the funniest thing about them is their hair, but then Meatballs was made in 1979. (""And introducing Chris Makepeace as Rudy"" announce the opening credits. No, not THE Chris Makepeace?!).Mercifully, Reitman rectified his mistake two years later for Stripes.

You have competing summer camps in this one: the rich kids vs. the underachievers competing for ""bragging"" rights in the typical camp contests, while the kids and consolers pursue pranks, sex, and ""a good time!"" ""Are You Ready For The Summer?"" Meatballs is the first (and best) summer camp movie for feel-good comedy. As others have posted, it's no Citizen Kane, but this type of movie isn't meant to be. The film works because of the wonderful comic timing and classic one-liners of Bill Murray. His scenes with a camper where he tries to raise the kid's self-esteem are very good. Bill's one-liners throughout the film are very funny.I also like that this movie isn't dirty or explicit like so many other ""teens at camp"" movies today. There is some mild sexual innuendo and maybe one or two cuss words in the entire film. But Meatballs is the type of teen movie that is actually appropriate for the younger crowd. It's rated PG.This is a movie that you have to see a few times to get all of the jokes! When Bill Murray is on the screen or making one of his classic ""PA Announcements"" you are drawn to the film. Bill seems to carry the movie all by himself. But he does it so well, that when you see Meatballs, you will realize that this is the film that made him a star!

In my case I, at the time this film was released, was the same age as some of the junior campers in the film.  For me watching this film brings back the memories of my camp years.  While some of the pranks that takes place in this movie, like carrying the camp director out in his bed and leaving him on the side of a road, strung up in the trees or out on a lake, are a bit over the top some of the other pranks are not.  When I went to camp the campers and counselors pulled similar stunts such as running underwear up the flag pole, canoe battles and boys raiding the girls cabin.  As I grew older I realized these night raids to the girls cabin that I participated in were carefully orchestrated by the counselors so that we wouldn't find the girls in embarrassing situations but at the time I thought it was real and it was fun.  That's what MEATBALLS (MB) is.  MB captures not only the scenic beauty of camp surroundings but the beauty of being young and carefree.  MB give a great example of pre-teens, teens and young adults living their summer with no concerns other than guys hooking up with girls and girls hooking up with guys and booth having as much fun as they can before they head back to junior high & high school and college.  The opening title song that goes ""Are you ready for the summer?...no more homework no more books, no more teachers dirty looks..."" describes exactly how summer is viewed by school kids. 
I personally enjoyed the two campers Spaz and Fink.  What boy, nerd or jock, didn't spend all camp trying to cozy up to some pretty girl camper? What guy didn't want to be accepted by the other campers and counselors?  While these two characters are somewhat over the top I bet everybody who watches the film can't help but to like these two guys.  These two characters are a mix of Charlie Brown from PEANUTS and Jack Tripper & Larry Dallas from THREE'S COMPANY.  I would bet that most viewers even cheer for Spaz in the egg carrying competition and for Fink as he attempts to ""beat the stomach"" in the hot dog eating contest. Lastly, this movie had normal looking kids and counselors.  No super models for counselors or campers that wore trendy clothing.  It is fun to just kick back and watch this film and remember when life was as fun as this movie.",Meatballs
49,cadfile,You must watch this movie or Morty will be sent to the state penitentiary.,10,11 February 2005,"""Meatballs"" is an ode to summer camp. Those of us who got to go to camp will see many of the scenes as we remember or wish they could have been.Bill Murray plays senior boys counselor Tripper Harrison, who really runs the camp. He reminds us of the funny cool staff member who everyone loves. Young campers gravitate toward him and if he speaks to you, you feel like you are family. This is one of Murray's best roles. He drives the film with his one liners and ad-libs.Chris Makepeace plays Rudy, the loner camper who is taken under Tripper's wing and breaks out of his shell.The rest of the campers and staff in the film were excellent as well.The overall theme of the movie is the underdog overcoming obstacles to finally win. From Rudy to Spaz to the Camp and even to Tripper himself, the underdogs of the film are the stars. The movie has heart.The film is fun and funny without being cruel or oversexed as some teen movies are today. The cast look and act like real people.The comedy and heart draw you in to the point that at the end, just like at camp, you are sad to leave.In my summer camp experience we had underwear run up flag poles, mystery meat, trying to sneak a peek into the girls cabin, the lunatic-with-the hook stories around the camp fire, and moving sleeping people out of their cabins and putting them elsewhere. But we also had a dedicated camp staff guiding us to be the best we could be.My favorite scene is the CIT overnight when they are canoeing across the lake singing a goofy song.

I was amazed at how bad it was.Not sure if it's the editing, directing, or screenplay but almost every scene made me cringe, I felt embarassed for the actors. Not a single funny joke or set piece came off. Not one!! Also the pacing was atrocious, the scene when Murray convinces the kid to stay being the worst. That should have been a 30-second or a 1-minute scene but it was probably around 5 or 6 minutes. Brutal!The reason I wanted to watch this is because I'm sure that either consciously or unconsciously this movie was in the minds of the creators of Friday the 13th and The Burning.

It's hard to believe thats it's almost 20yrs old.A young 29yr old Bill Murray was great in it.If you have never seen Meatballs, I highly recommend it. All of the other sequels that followed it are a big waste of time. Meatballs got my 10 vote... I want it to come out on DVD soon...",Meatballs
52,Axiom-2,Best Camp Movie Ever!!!,10,28 March 1999,"This is a true classic comedy. I can watch it over & over again & enjoy it like I'm watching it for the first time. Bill Murray was great in it. His line: ""To be in top physical condition, you gotta pay the price "" Is one of my all-time classic lines. A great film that brings back a lot of memories for me. Meatballs is a real winner.",Meatballs
53,Seller7862,Bill Murray's star went supernova,9,2 November 2020,"As some others have said, this movie works because it captures what summer camp is when we remember it years later.
Growing up, twice I went to summer camp. Once as an innocent pre-teen. the second time as kid in the grip of puberty. Created a lot of fond memories as well as some painful awkward ones.
Because of the time of life we experience these social interactions they leave a lasting impression, and this movie captures that magic, and leaves it's own warm impression. Of course I saw this movie a couple years after I had attended my 2nd and final summer camp, so the nostalgia worked on my young mind in a way I think Reitman was hoping for.
Speaking of Ivan Reitman. I assume that he was a big fan of the film ""Bad News Bears"", because this movie borrows much of its sensibility from that movie. Just the right mixture of comedy and tenderness.
I gave it a 9. It deserves a 7, but the 6.2 rating convinced me it deserved a bump. So ...",Meatballs
54,DEPRESSEDcherry,Are you ready for the summer?,6,12 March 2021,"Probably of more appeal to those who went to summer camp during the 70s and 80s, the value is high for anyone seeking a hit of nostalgia.
It's more amusing than laugh out loud funny, and the plot follows a standard road in a fairly loose fashion.
Bill Murray in his first starring role makes this a more interesting watch, as does the realisation that it was filmed during an actual camp season.",Meatballs
55,VCRanger,Are you ready for the summer?,7,23 April 1999,"Meatballs is an EXTREMELY dated but very entertaining film.  It tells a story about a summer camp that is the ""red-headed stepchild"" to the ""rich kids"" summer camp which gets all the breaks.  It also tells a story of a ""loner"" who has very little self esteem, but is befriended by the head camp counseler.  Bill Murray is the true star of this film and without him, it would be a bomb.  Fortunately, he is in it and it is a good movie.  A rating of 7 out of 10 was given.",Meatballs

58,FilmStalker,Should be Forgotten in Time,4,16 September 2003,'Meatballs' is the typical hi-jinx comedy that would come out during the late seventies and early eighties. Bill Murray leads a whole bunch of unknowns as one of the camp leaders of North Star. Across the way is evil and rich Camp Mohawk. Most of the humor is innuendo with most of the cast being kids.Bill Murray offers the only highlights in this one and can even be observed as cute when he helps a young boy suffering from low self esteem. Had even more forgettable sequels following it's release.,Meatballs
59,tavives,Why do all the movie critics miss the boat on this?,8,9 October 2011,"I'm pleased to see so many good comments on this movie here. What I don't get is that Meatballs is always advertised as this kind of bawdy, teen sex comedy when you see a write up on it. Even IMDb in it's description goes there.Meatballs is really not that kind of movie. It is a very sweet little film about a bunch of misfits who find that they are not so bad after all. It also is the story of how one boy goes from outcast to hero after he is taken under the wing of a caring counselor.Sure there are jokes and highjinks, and a few teenage sexual references, but nothing over the top and they are all characteristic and true to form for summer camps.I love this movie. I loved when I was a kid, and I love it still today, and think it should almost be mandatory viewing for any young kid who feels like an outsider.",Meatballs

As an adult in the present sex- obsessed American culture, it doesn't have enough nudity to be called tame. If you are looking for American Pie-type lewdness, vulgarity or fart and feces jokes, Meatballs will disappoint with impunity and a guarantee. If you like Bill Murray, and you like good clean fun, you will probably like and enjoy this film very much. Similarly with Stripes, Ghostbusters, Caddy Shack, etc. Enough said, just go watch it, and stop intellectualizing it. It's Meatballs, for crying out loud! Why read a review? Just enjoy it and have fun. And ignore the trash talk by others. Films, like so many other things in life, are subjective. To each his own.

This one could be seen as a refreshing blast from the past. It's worth watching, and I don't believe it would be dated in any significant way. Classic humor is classic humor, and good writing is good writing regardless of the era in which created.I would love to see this film again; it came to mind after having seen the somewhat similar ""Summer School"" on television recently. Like that slightly newer film, ""Meatballs"" is funny without being cruel, overly sexual or indulging in bathroom humor. The key, of course, is how the adult character makes such a difference in the life of the teen character -- maybe even a virtually life-saving change -- and how they both grow up in the space of a summer.",Meatballs
63,treemarc,2 flicks in one,7,2 July 2007,"I just saw this for the first time in 10 or 15 years...maybe close to 20. In some ways, it was better than I remembered...in other, it was MUCH worse.First of all, there's the music. It's just plain awful. There are only 5 songs in the movie, most of them used more than once. The opening song is shrieked by a chorus of annoying children, and the disco-y title track is performed by Rick Dees. It doesn't get any worse than that. Even the background music is terrible, with much of it repeating the themes of the other nauseating tunes. We also get some truly lame slapstick, mostly in the opening credits.On the other hand, Bill Murray is spot on brilliant as usual...you have to wonder if he ad-libbed the whole thing, or if the writers just gave him all the funny lines. Or maybe he's just that great- turning a weak script into comic genius. The best part are his surreal PA announcements. (""Lobsters...get out of here...you're a menace!"")You also get a lot more character development than you have any right to expect in a movie like this. At least half the characters seem like real people...and mostly real people you would like to have around. Even ""Spaz"" gets to do a more than any other Eddie Deezen-type character ever did, and when he gets the girl, it's plausible. (She's not absurdly hot, but he doesn't automatically pair up with one of the nerd girls- see ""Revenge Of The Nerds"" for examples of both cinematic phenomenons.)And when the plot seems clichéd...well, ya gotta wonder if it wasn't a cliché yet when they made this. While it wasn't the first summer camp movie- ya gotta go back at least to ""The Parent Trap""- it's certainly the movie that made it it's own genre. In fact, I was surprised that there was no Talent Show scene...""Wet Hot American Summer"" spoofed the summer-camp genre so perfectly, I just assumed everything in it came straight out of Meatballs. (I also half-expected Jon Cryer to pull up in a convertible with a chimp, thanks to ""Mr. Show's"" epic camp-olympiad spoof ""Monk Academy"") Anyway, this one seems to be vanishing a little as far as the late-70's/early 80's comedies- it's not a cable staple anymore, and certainly doesn't have the cult following of Caddyshack or Animal House. I was pleased to catch it on Showtime today- and in High Definition at that! Sure, it's pretty awful in spots, but you could do a lot worse in a 70's/80's teen comedy. And again, Murray is a genius.",Meatballs

Yassir Arafat is gonna come out, spend a weekend with the kids just rap with them.""These and many other great lines make Meatballs a hall-of-fame comedy. Only in Caddyshack is Bill Murray funnier.

65,Plumpkin,It just doesn't matter,8,7 July 2004,"When I was younger, this movie always aired on Friday night in the summer on Channel 40 (this was the years before Fox was a network and took over the programming).  I always looked forward to it.  I'd go grocery shopping with my parents, then sit down with my Swanson's TV dinner and a Lady Lee Cola(the only time of the week I was allowed to drink cola, and enjoy. Sure, the script is predictably late 70's (like Little Darlings), but it's a fun movie, and I loved Rudy and Tripper.  Bill Murray coasts with little effort in the movie, but he is charming.  Gotta love Spaz and those taped glasses (pre Revenge of the Nerds).  Chris Makepeace is pretty much the same character he played in ""My Bodyguard"" but he does it so well.",Meatballs

67,vancecheek,"If you've not seen this movie, what is wrong with you!",8,21 July 2019,"This is pre-""Stripes"" and ""Ghostbusters"", Irving and Murray. That said, it still shows heart which is their trademark. Murray is Tripper, the official No. 2 guy who really runs the Camp although the uptight geek Morty spends most of his time trying to be recognized as the leader of this group of college age delinquents who spend their Summer chasing tail under the guise of teaching little kids the lessons of summer camp.Everyone is likeable at this camp which catches crap from the snooty rich kids camp across the lake. The end of the movie entails the annual camp competition between the snots and the juvies and I'll let you take a wild guess who wins THIS year.The heart comes in the form of a healthy, Big Bro/Little Bro relationship forged by Murray's Tripper and camp outcast ""Rudy"". Rudy is a good kid but smack dab in his awkward phase and he's immediately hated by the other kids because he sucks at sports. Tripper hangs with him and instills a self-pride is cool lesson in Rudy as they daily bond over early morning runs and late night poker games.Tripper's relationship with Rudy is clean, brotherly and cool. They way they ought to be. Tripper slips Rudy into a crucial role in the Camp Games and you know Rudy will come through for himself and for Trip. Good stuff!Jokes are corny, the CIS are horny, but nothing is shown - just implied. The nerd and the fat guy get pantsed and their boxers are the most skin shown apart from a hot chick in a bikini glance here and there. I let my daughter see this movie at age 8 before she went off to camp so it's not an '80's t&a flick. Even the language is tame, considering.Watch this flick every May 31! Have fun for 90 mins, and then have a good summer! Watch it again on Labor Day as it will help you reflect on the Hi's, Bye's, and fun of your summer - maybe get you ready for next year.

The perfect mix between a movie that children can watch with adult details that only adults can understand, and the so-called sequels are only a swindle. This movie is only overcome by 'Revenge of the Nerds', one step beyond it in sexuality but the same esence at last.

I was a teenager (14) at the time of the release of this film so I can identify with many of the same problems/dilemmas that the campers/CIT's in this movie have. I enjoy seeing the clothes that were worn at this time and hearing the same old urban legends such as was told on the overnight canoe trip. The film is also full of funny one liners.

81,CineCritic2003,One of The Best Summer Camp Movies Ever Made,10,30 April 2004,"Yes, it feels, and for the most part plays like an ""after school special"", for a slightly more adult audience, alright maybe a teen audience.   But add in Bill Murray (already showing some dramatic as well as his usual comedic talent), a nice supporting cast, and an unexpected sweetness about growing up, and remembering those great, or not so great days at summer camp, and you get a heartwarming, funny, sleeper hit.It does get a little too smarmy for its own good, but that is also one of its charms.  When you hear the title ""Meatballs"", and see the poster, you expect a teenage sex romp, but what you get is a sentamental, yet sometimes sexy look back at those formative years at summer camp.  The sentamentality, and the remberances of simpler times reminds me of ""A Christmas Story"", which I also love.  The rememberances of summer camp were never so well stated.  The only movie I've seen that comes close, is ""Indian Summer"", which I like almost as much as ""Meatballs"", and also stars Matt Craven. Let's hope he completes the trilogy.  Maybe he could come back for ""Return of the Meatballs"", and bring some dignity back to the franchise (Meatballs 2 through 4 bare no resemblence to the original classic).""Meatballs"" is easily on my Top 10 Guilty Pleasures of all time (not really guilty either).

I know many of the movies from that time were cheesy, but they were genuinely funny, e.g., Stripes, Revenge of the Nerds, Strange Brew. I love Bill Murray but hated ""Tripper"". The movie did do a good job in defining the ""summer camp movie"". I hear about people recalling this fondly. It has developed a cult following.

Not that the supporting characters aren't great. But Bill's early comedic genius (and really a little dramatic ability) really shines in this movie. The friendship between him and the boy brings some substance to the plot. It's interesting to know they came back and filmed additional scenes with him and Rudy. And of course his inspirational speech during the Olympiad is a classic! There are lot of quotable lines he brings to this movie that are still popular to this day.

Bill Murray is hysterical and you gotta love that 4-mile trail race at the end! A total classic and one of my favorites now for about 20 years. It brings back fond memories of camp and deals nicely with the experience of being rejected by foolish peers and the empowerment brought one by being rescued by a sympathetic adult. Tons of great one-liners and quite an assortment of wacko counselors. This is the kind of movie where you repeat key phrases among friends for years afterward. Also nothing overtly crude and what a sweet late '70's soundtrack to bring on just the right amount of nostalgia. I can't say enough about Meatballs; it's a classic. Be forewarned!

Bill Murray is, well, Bill Murray, in life and in the movie. Sweet, funny, considerate and embracing, Bill never disappoints. This is a slice of life/coming of age movie that represents so many aspects of youth that are difficult but survivable.

Good clean fun for the kids and mindless entertainment for the older folks. The story line is simple and easy to follow. Murray has done better, but this is his first film. The movie reminds me of a time when we didn't need blood and guts to be entertained. Morty is the head dunce and plays the part perfect.

The cast of characters are fun and zany and you really come to care about them and the relationships they have with each other. This is not another sleazy, dumb, teen sex-fest. It is funny and sweet and just all-around fun. Anyone who sees this will enjoy themselves. It is a must-see. Watch out for Spaz - he is by far the best character!

It's one of the experiences that make me smile when someone says ""Bill Murray."" I almost always like movies involving the underdog, and this movie has more underdogs than you can count. It's overall a kind movie--some of the adults are not wrapped tightly, but the laughter is accepting rather than brutal like so many teen movies these days. The rich kids across the lake take a beating, but no one I know minded at all. I never went to camp, but I did some things that were somewhat parallel and most of the ""bits"" and tricks ran true. They were even understated at times, but I'm sure that was an accident.The cast performed well, with Bill Murray showing hints of what he would become. It's not Groundhog Day or Broken Flowers, but, hey, a good goofy laugh should be appreciated these days, but then...it just doesn't matter...............................",Meatballs
