0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not the easiest watch, but hugely rewarding",9,9 June 2017,"Alejandro González Iñárritu to me is an immensely talented director, with not a bad film (from personal opinion) in his filmography. Some films are better than others, 'Babel' to me is his weakest though still very good, but even when Iñárritu is not at his best he is still significantly better than many directors at their best and worst.It is easy to see why '21 Grams' won't appeal to everybody. It is not an easy watch and there are many other films that have better replay value, but it is still a fine film, with so many great things, that both challenges and rewards those who love the film. '21 Grams' has a non-linear structure that can feel fragmented, and there are a couple of parts that are not as clear as it could have been and cause a little confusion. The ending also could have been better rounded off.'21 Grams', as always with Iñárritu is a visual and technical marvel, with photography that's gritty, atmospheric, beautiful and intimate, clever editing and striking scenery. Iñárritu's direction is exemplary, with a breath taking vision, mastery of mood and taking risks and not holding back. The music is not amazing but it fits well.The script in '21 Grams' is tense, poignant and thought-provoking, while most of the story is thematically and dramatically gripping with plenty of intensity and emotional impact as well as a suitably bleak tone. The characters are compellingly real.Have nothing but praise for the acting, which is some of the best acting of that year. Sean Penn is splendid in one of his best performances, while Naomi Watts' performance is very close to a career-best. Best of all is Benico Del Toro who really gets into the complex meat of his character, an intense and moving performance that in no way falls into hamminess. Melissa Leo and Charlotte Gainsburg are fine too if not in the same league as the three leads.Overall, challenging but rewarding. 9/10 Bethany Cox",21 Grams
1,SnoopyStyle,remarkable performances,9,20 August 2016,"This is an interconnected story of tragic figures in a non-linear time line. Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts) is a recovering drug addict, a suburban wife, and mother. Her husband and girls are killed by ex-con Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro). The husband's heart is donated to Paul Rivers (Sean Penn). Paul breaks up with his wife Mary (Charlotte Gainsbourg). He tracks down the donor and begins a relationship with Cristina who returns to drugs. Jack turns himself in despite his wife (Melissa Leo)'s objection. Cristina refuses to press charges but then talks Paul into killing him.The acting from the three leads and everyone else is top-rate. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu's use of non-linear story telling can be controversial. For me, it sharpened my attention as I disentangled the narrative. It heightens the intensity. Also this method of story telling had yet to wear out its welcome. It does get overused after this. The acting is simply remarkable.",21 Grams
2,claudio_carvalho,"A Depressing Story, One of the Saddest Movies Ever",10,4 September 2004,"Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts) is a well-married housewife, living with her two lovely daughters and her husband in a comfortable house. Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is a mathematician, married with Mary Rivers (Charlotte Gainsbourg) and having troubles with his heart, needing an urgent transplantation and waiting for a donator. Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro) is a former drug dealer and small time crook, married with Marienne Jordan (Melissa Meo) and having a son and a daughter, who found his salvation in Jesus, becoming a good man and a fanatic religious. A horrible car accident joins the lives of Cristina, Paul and Jack, affecting their families and friends. In order to avoid spoilers, I do not intend to go any further in my summary of the plot.""21 Grams"" is a movie supported by a great screenplay, magnificent direction and wonderful interpretations. The screenplay presents the story in non-chronological fragments, like in ""Pulp Fiction"", disclosing in pieces like a puzzle a depressing story, certainly in one of the saddest movies ever. The direction of Alejandro González Anirritu is impressive. This is the second movie directed by him that I saw (the other one was ""Amores Perros"") and both of them are excellent films. The greatest reference I can mention is the IMDb User Rating: ""Amores Perros"" (top 250: #139, with 8.2) and ""21 Grams"" (top 250: #188, with 8.0). Therefore, many viewers share my opinion in this regard. The performance of the cast is something unique: Naomi Watts proves that she is not only a beautiful face and body on the screen, but also a terrific actress, being nominated by the Academy for the Best Actress Award. Benicio Del Toro, who was found some years ago, has another great performance in an important role, the trigger of the situations exposed in the story. Sean Penn is an outstanding actor, always a synonym of high-quality performance and it is not necessary to say thing else about him. Melissa Meo, Charlotte Gainsbourg and the rest of the cast have inspired acting. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil):'21 Gramas' ('21Grams')",21 Grams
3,classicsoncall,"""Life does not just go on.""",8,14 April 2018,"Even devotees of non-linear story telling movies might have some difficulty with this picture. The very early sequences of the movie tend to leave one confused and disoriented, seeming as if the principal characters have an established relationship to each other. That idea gets quickly negated as the film moves forward, and you're left scratching your head over something you might have just seen that doesn't make sense any more. It goes on like this for a while until the pieces of the puzzle eventually fall into place, by which time you begin to understand that none of the central characters is particularly appealing and the kind of people you want to root for. A good part of that is owed to the exceptional performances of Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio del Toro, all of whom demonstrate a wide range of thought and emotion demonstrated by their characters. Naomi Watts in particular delivers an outstanding performance in the role of a widow who's lost not only her husband, but two young daughters as well, in an accident that eventually brings all three figures together in an astonishing climax. The '21 Grams' the movie's title refers to dates all the way back to a pseudo-scientific experiment done in 1901 by a physician named Duncan MacDougall, who was convinced the human soul had weight, and that it could be measured at the time of death by taking the before and after weights of people about to die. Though the experiment was highly flawed, the result the experimenter came up with has lived on as an urban legend of sorts. Upon thoughtful consideration, that really has nothing to do with the premise of this story, as it's thrown into the script one time for matters of association but with no bearing on anything that actually happened in it. Before watching the film, '21 grams' sounded like it could have referred to a quantity of drugs involved in some fatal overdose scenario, but instead it might be the amount of brain power required to concentrate on the film until it's baffling conclusion. Anyone else wondering whether Sean Penn's character shot himself accidentally or on purpose?",21 Grams
4,gavin6942,This Film was Inspiring,8,10 March 2006,"This is the way to make movies: a decent plot, a few twists, characters you can identify with, and a director who actually gives a hoot about what he's doing.21 Grams is the story of three people (Benicio Del Toro, Sean Penn, and Naomi Watts) whose lives intertwine when another man dies in a car accident. The connections between them grow and twist like vines, leaving you and your heart trapped in the middle, like a mouse caught in a vice.My biggest fear was Sean Penn's over-acting (see ""Casualties of War""), but it was luckily absent from this film. Naomi Watts was excellent as usual (see ""Mulholland Drive"") and she was filmed in such a way to make her acting stand out better than her beauty, which I think did wonders to the story. Benicio Del Toro? Heck, I have nothing bad to say about him.One thing I really liked was the use of hand-held cameras. Not all movies can pull this off - we, the audience, like a nice polished look. But this worked, adding to the reality of the situation and the grit of the story. I think a clean, touched-up camera would have ruined the masterpiece I saw.Some people compare this movie to ""Pulp Fiction"" and call it a ripoff. Quite frankly, I think they're on crack cocaine. These two films have nothing in common, other than the use of scenes shown out of order. Does that make all films a Pulp Fiction ripoff who use this technique to slowly unravel a tale? There was no other connection -- no mafia, no drug deals, no Royales with Cheese.This film is so recommended you should put it on your Easter want list or maybe your bridal registry.",21 Grams
5,lee_eisenberg,good grief,8,13 May 2006,"First off, I should identify that ""21 Grams"" is not the easiest movie to watch; specifically, it's all about grief. Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro play some people whose lives get intertwined following a car wreck.A previous reviewer said that the movie's non-linear structure makes it somewhat confusing. I guess that it does a little bit, but that misses the overall point of the movie. The movie is showing the gut-wrenching existences that these people live. As it is, Penn's role here pretty much mirrors his role in ""Mystic River"".All in all, it's a well done movie. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu gets down and dirty the same way that he did in ""Amores Perros"". I do recommend the movie, but I should warn you: don't expect anything light and fluffy.",21 Grams
6,jboothmillard,21 Grams,7,7 July 2016,"When I first heard the title of this film, I assumed it was something to do with drug dealing or something, in fact the title refers to the amount of body weight supposedly lost at the moment of death, directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu (Amores Perros, Babel, Birdman, The Revenant). Basically the story is told in a non-linear manner, and focuses on three unassociated and well-meaning but flawed characters who are brought together by a tragic car accident that changes their lives. Paul Rivers (BAFTA nominated Sean Penn) is a critically ill mathematician in a loveless marriage to English emigrant Mary (Nymphomaniac's Charlotte Gainsbourg), he has a fatal heart condition, Mary wants him to donate his sperm so she can have a baby after he dies. Cristina Peck (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Naomi Watts) is an upper-class suburban housewife and happily married homemaker with two young daughters, she is a recovering addict with a secret past of drug abuse and alcoholism. Jack Jordan (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Benicio Del Toro) is an ex-convict who has turned to the Christian faith, and in doing so has found strength to recover from drug and alcohol addiction, and he has raised a family. One evening the three are tied together when Jack kills Cristina's husband and children in a hit-and-run accident, her husband's heart is donated to Paul, who begins his recovery, Cristina is devastated and returns to drugs and alcohol, Jack is stricken with guilt and starts using drugs again, and while incarcerated he unsuccessfully attempts to suicide. In the time that follows, Cristina does not press charges against Jack, leaving prison Jack cannot incorporate himself into normal life, and leaves home to work in manual labour, and Paul finds an opportunity to meet Cristina, she is unaware of the heart donation, they form a close and eventually ignite a relationship. Cristina is furious when she finds out the surgery, and forces him, but eventually reconsiders, needing each other they continue their relationship, but his new heart is rejecting the heart transplant, the outlook looks grim, Cristina starts to dwell on the tragic past, and becomes obsessed with exacting revenge on Jack. Paul is goaded by Cristina to murdering Jack, using the same private detective that found Cristina, Paul finds Jack, but holding him at gunpoint he is unable to kill him, Paul tells him to ""just disappear"", but Jack later returns, still feeling guilty for the heartache he has caused, he wants Paul to kill him, there is a struggle, it ends with Paul collapsing and shooting himself. Jack and Cristina rush Paul to hospital, despite telling he shot Paul, Jack is released by the police, Paul dies, and the conflict between Cristina and Jack stays unresolved, Cristina finds out she is pregnant and prepares for a new baby, and Jack returns to his family. Also starring The Fighter's Melissa Leo as Marianne Jordan, Eddie Marsan as Reverend John, Clea DuVall as Claudia, Danny Huston as Michael, Paul Calderon as Brown and Denis O'Hare as Dr. Rothberg. Penn, Watts and Del Toro are fine acting talents, and each give splendid performances, the story with three lives brought together by an accident is cleverly done, with good themes of faith and redemption, it is unusual to have events before and after the event not playing in chronological order, but it is edited in a way that you can still understand what goes in what order, an interesting drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay and Best Editing. Very good!",21 Grams
7,moonspinner55,"Ironic, brave, intense...",8,10 December 2005,"Snapshots of tragedy: the lives of three people--a wife and mother of two, a dying man in need of a new heart, and an ex-con turned counselor at a religious center--intersect after a tragic car accident. ""21 Grams"", directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu from an original screenplay by Guillermo Arriaga, consists of dramatic episodes involving these characters (both before and after the accident), with scene after scene presented--one may assume--in random order; yet, there's a method to this editing madness, and the film's narrative actually feels much more linear in retrospect. Iñárritu is visually addicted to squalor (he sees the lonely beauty of it) and his film is unrelentingly gritty; this ambiance is matched by the performances of all three principles--Naomi Watts, Sean Penn, and Benicio Del Toro--each of whom perform totally without vanity. It is a remarkable achievement, with a few sequences of textbook dramatics completely recharged by the style, the desperate energy, and Iñárritu's emotional handling. An intense, gripping couple of hours! Two Oscar nominations: for Watts as Best Actress and Del Torro as Best Supporting Actor. ***1/2 from ****",21 Grams
8,Quinoa1984,Absorbing and powerful direction & acting; the story structure was less than great,8,3 January 2004,"Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu made a well-deserved leap into the renown film-making pool with Amores Perros, and his follow up 21 Grams shows him with plenty of talent to spare. He also gets three (or more, depends on how effective one thinks the supporting performance were) forceful, compelling performances out of Sean Penn, Benicio Del-Torro, and Naomi Watts. They're involved in three interlocking stories- Penn as a mathematician with a rottening health and a near-rottening relationship; Del-Torro's found Jesus Christ after being in and out of jail for part of his life; Watts is a house-wife who may have some deep troubles within her mind. Each of the three leads doesn't go for cheap drama, and each one plunges the depths of their own abilities to find truths that might not be possible with lesser material or a lesser director. I won't say much more about the stories, however I do have something to say about the structure of the film. The script brings some mesmerizing scenes, ones with great tragedy that bring out a viewer's compassion. Never-the-less, there was something about the structure that I didn't think was all that great. In films like Once Upon a Time in America, Reservoir Dogs, and even Memento, the scrambled story structure had a purpose, adding appropriate twists and turns for the audience. 21 Grams (like Amores Perros in a sense) has that non-linear basis to it too, and sometimes it works for the audience to react. But I think there would be a lot more power to how these characters' fates and tragedies unfold if it was told linearly from start to finish. In many moments in the film I found myself knowing a little too much before a particular scene unfolded, or I found myself guessing about something that I didn't need to (one of the points of non-linear storytelling is answers first, questions later). It wasn't an aspect that made the film bad, yet the stock that writer Guillermo Arriaga and director Inarritu put into this structure over interlocking the stories in order, or perhaps telling each story separately, is the film's only drawback.",21 Grams
9,michaelRokeefe,What is life?,8,14 June 2005,"Stark and deeply dark. 21 GRAMS is the telling of three disparate people who become linked as a result of an ill-fated auto accident. Jack Jordan(Benicio Del Toro)is a born-again Christian ex-con, who accidentally kills a family on his way home from work. He turns himself in and finds himself behind bars again guilt-ridden. Cristina Peck(Namoni Watts)is a woman fighting her drug addiction as she is given the news of her husband and two daughters being killed in the car accident. In the midst of her grief, Cristina agrees to donate her husband's heart to a math professor, Paul Rivers(Sean Penn)suffering congenital heart disease.Upon release from the hospital, Paul hires a detective to seek out Cristina. Soon they enter a doom-stricken romance and future that is shared with the self-loathing Jordon. Through the pity and remorse, the self righteous ex-con feels Paul and Cristina should not be together.This is a real passionate movie that suffers the distraction of darting back and forth from past to present to past. 21 GRAMS is very volatile, animalistic and no less riveting. There is so much self-hatred guilt and urgent sexual expression it is hard to find just a glimmer of hope or optimism. Tragedy kills ambition.",21 Grams
10,sunwarrior13,A Movie In The Tradition of Memento,10,13 October 2011,"21 Grams is movie that in the tradition of movies such as Memento. It involves three characters namely Paul, Christina and Jack and how their lives have been interlocked with one another. Paul, portrayed by talented actor Sean Penn, is living in bad health and having a bad relationship with his wife.Jack ,portrayed by Benicio del Torro, is person who has been in and out of jail for lot of petty crimes and who has been a Jesus Christ fanatic. While Christina, played by Naomi Watts, is a wife who has been recovering from the murder of her husband and children that were victims of a hit and run car accident and that of a drug user. The story is told in FRAGMENTS that one has to watch attentively to the film. It is not a traditional film that is told from the beginning to end. The best comparison is probably a CD player playing song tracks of a CD at RANDOM. This is the story of three gentle people: Paul,Christina,and Jack.They will be brought together by a terrible accident that will change their lives. By the final frame, none of them will be the same as they will learn harsh truths about love, faith, courage, desire and guilt, and how chance can change our worlds irretrievably, forever.Personally,I have to watch the movie twice just to fully understand the movie and the development of each character. But the film proved to be worth watching for it teaches us lessons about life and spirituality. Also, the acting proved to be great and worthy of Academy Award nominations especially for Del Torro and Watts.I recommend this film to anyone who wants movies that tells stories in a NON-TRADITIONAL manner or anyone who has seen and enjoyed Memento.",21 Grams
11,jotix100,Three lives,10,13 December 2003,"Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has come out with another winner with this new film. The movie is co-written with his collaborator, Guillermo Arriaga, the one also responsible for ""Amores Perros"".In a way, this film, if one compares it with the previous work, is a variation on the same theme, as in the other picture. Mr. Gonzalez Inarritu evidently has a knack for the kinds of stories in which fate is at the center of the action, or is it coincidence? What brings these three different lives together? He seems to be telling us these characters are very much connected, even though no has a knowledge of the others.The acting is first rate. Naomi Watts is brilliant in her approach to Cristina, the young mother who is at the center of the story. This is a very talented woman who loses herself in whatever woman she plays. She is never boring to watch. Also, Melissa Leo. What an incredible actress! I have seen her many times on stage, but in this film she goes beyond our expectations.The other incredible work in the film is by Benicio del Toro. He gives life to this Jack Jordan, a loser, who has seen the light and is trying to redeem himself.Much has been said about Sean Penn's acting in this film, but his Paul Rivers is an enigma. By the end of the film we keep wondering about him, but only the other three keep haunting our mind. Mr. Penn is very good in the movie, but my feeling was that we never knew him, or perhaps the other characters are stronger and therefore one's reaction to this tormented soul he plays.Let's hope the team responsible for this film won't make us wait very long for their next collaboration. Mr. Gonzalez Unarritu proves he is a talented director in his native Mexico as well as in the American cinema.",21 Grams
12,lastliberal,Film Magic,10,19 March 2007,"2004 was a great year for films. This was one of the very best. Don't just take my word for it; look at the 27 nominations and 20 wins it took.Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu must have been practicing for Babel. They have a similar style of telling three interlocking stories, but Babel flowed a little more smoothly that 21 Grams. That is not a criticism of this film. You need to invest your time to follow along. It takes a little more work than most movie goers are used to, but it is worth it. I got distracted the first time I tried and had to stop and start all over. I'm glad I did.The acting by Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro, and Naomi Watts was over the top. All three put in first-class performances to tell a story that was intense from start to finish.What can I say that all the film critics have not said? Invest your time in this film to see great actors and a great director work magic.",21 Grams
13,grantss,"Confusing, tiring, disappointing, anti-climactic",4,22 February 2015,"Confused, tired, disappointed, left hanging, that is how I feel about 21 Grams. Another feeling I had was a headache from trying to figure out all the supposed hidden meanings, and the closing monologue. The back-and-forth-in-time scene sequence didn't work for me. I don't necessarily believe movies should be linear (two of my favourite movies are Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, and they are not linear in their scene sequence), but 21 Grams overdoes the non- linearity. I kept feeling like I was cheating, as if I was skipping forward in the movie. A linear storytelling would have worked a lot better, and made me feel more surprised when the story took a twist.There were too many loose ends in the movie (I won't mention them, to avoid spoiling the movie for others). I just felt like I was left hanging.I couldn't grasp the implication of the 21 grams concept, even though I thought I understood the idea before the movie started. I left the movie feeling confused, and quite bitter, as I felt ripped off as the supposed deeper meaning was fairly lame or unfathomable, and the movie fairly pretentious.",21 Grams

15,Boba_Fett1138,Pure movie making at its very best.,10,18 October 2005,"This is pure movie making at its very best. The non-linear storytelling works perfect for the movie.The story is difficult to describe, also due to the fact that not everything is told chronological. The movie sounds difficult but it never becomes confusing. Everything is making sense and connected brilliantly to each other. The movie has three main characters played by; Sean Penn, Noami Watts and Benicio Del Toro. Each character has an own storyline that are all in one way or another connected to each other. The movie is brilliantly put together and are once more proof of it that all you need to make a brilliant movie is a brilliant story.But it's not just only the story that is brilliant in this movie, so are the actors. Mainly Noami Watts and Benicio Del Toro are superb and chilling in their roles. Both were also nominated for an Oscar for their roles in this movie. Also keep an eye on Eddie Marsan he is a great new rising star and has already played in some great productions and has some more great production in the pipeline. All of the characters feel very warm and realistic. They're all like normal everyday persons, until one event chances all their lives differently and they are bound to do things that they normally wouldn't. ""21 Grams"" is a powerful, confronting, gritty, realistic movie.Director Alejandro González Iñárritu makes with this movie a wonderful impression. If he continues to make movies like this, he'll grow into becoming one of the best directors in the business, at the moment.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",21 Grams
16,view_and_review,21 grams of fat,1,16 January 2007,"I know I'm in the minority here, but I really didn't like this movie. For the most part I like Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, and Benicio Del Toro and I even felt they did a good job in this film, but I just didn't like the movie. For one thing, it was too depressing. It seemed like nothing was going right for anyone. The three main characters were linked by tragic events that not only affected them, but affected the lives of their loved ones as well. Then, after linking them all I didn't see a point in continuing the movie. I mean... where was the movie trying to take me? What point was the movie trying to make? 21 grams? We lose 21 grams when we die? Who cares? OK, OK, I am not a fan of dramas, but I can stomach them if they are good. I just didn't feel this was a good movie.",21 Grams
17,evanston_dad,2003: The Year of Revenge,7,29 April 2005,"With the 2003 movie year behind us, it's clear to me that a major theme film makers explored in that year's releases (most certainly 9/11-induced) is that of revenge and, more importantly, the inability of revenge to right committed wrongs. ""21 Grams"" is a bleak, sober story about a grief-crazed woman seeking revenge out of desperation, the man who volunteers to help her carry out her desires and the ex-con who serves as the object of her revenge. The story has all the simplistic sadness of a tragedy, but that's not to say the movie itself is simplistic. Thematically, it's actually quite complex. In addition to the idea of revenge, the movie explores the ideas of fate and how one's own fate can be tied up in the fates of others; the value of life and the existence of the soul; and the fragility of physical and mental states. The acting is uniformly solid. People have seemed to single out Naomi Watts for praise, but that seems unfair to Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro. Indeed, the movie is so evenly divided into thirds, each third belonging to one of the principal characters, that it takes on an ensemble feel, with no one actor shining above the others.The film was criticized somewhat for its unnecessarily complicated structure, but that didn't bother me. Once you get through the first disorienting ten minutes or so, the pieces begin to fall into place, and loose ends are tied up deftly. It may be a bit pretentious--the fragmented narrative reflecting the fragmented souls of the characters--but it could have been handled much worse.Finally, kudos to the editor, who had the daunting task of assembling this film into coherency, and especially because of the fragmented approach.Grade: A-",21 Grams
18,ferguson-6,Jesus gave me that truck ... and 5 nickels,7,20 November 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  White hot director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarrita has fallen head over heels in love with his camera.  This is a strong character study of pain, heartbreak and guilt with an amazing cast delivering very real lines.  My only real problem is that the film runs 15-20 minutes longer than necessary.  Presented in non-linear (Memento-ish) style, you will find yourself caring a great deal for 3 lead characters who are basically not likable people.  The leads are three of the best actors working today: Sean Penn, Benicio del Toro and Naomi Watts (""The Ring""). Just as impressive is the supporting cast lead by the excellent Melissa Leo (TV's ""Homicide"") and Clea DuVall (the best thing about ""Identity"").  The script is very unique as the story lines are interwoven so as to help the audience feel the roller coaster of emotions that each of the characters experiences.  There is so much pain in each of their lives that none of them are really able to seize the positives.  Each searches for answers in different ways and avoid the confrontations necessary to find salvation. I said it in my comments from ""Mystic River"" and I will say it again: Sean Penn needs to work more often.  I read where he wants to give up acting and concentrate on directing.  I am begging him not to deprive us of his true talent.  There are very few chuckles in this one ... it is a very tough movie.  The dialog is realistic and almost nonexistent in parts.  This adds to the realism of the situations.  Hopefully next time out Mr. Innarita will show a little more restraint with the camera and be a bit more judicious in the editing room.  He does however, have an amazing eye for storytelling.",21 Grams
19,The_Void,Just another drama,3,25 March 2005,"A year or so ago, I saw a film about a horrible accident that affected three different parties. This film followed these three lives, and we saw how the accident caused their lives to intertwine. The film was directed by a man named Alejandro González Iñárritu, and was notable for it's gritty styling and downtrodden acting. The film was, of course, called 'Amores Perros'; but from the information given so far, it could easily have been 21 Grams. The only real difference between the two is that the first version of this story was massively superior to this retelling. 21 Grams has all the ingredients to be considered a great film by today's standards: a tragic story, lots of shouting...sorry, I mean ""powerful performances"" it's gritty, it's downbeat and it's even got the split method of story telling. However, there's just one problem; having these things in place is not the way to a great film. Ingeniuty, interesting stories, great acting - these are the things that make cinema great. I don't know what's wrong with people these days, why does stuff like 21 Grams always receive a strong critical reaction? The acting in this film is really great...or is it? Are you sure it's not just dull? One of the side effects of these gritty dramas taking over is that the art of acting has been cut back and cut back again until all that's left is a dreary residue; of which so many actors are more than happy to wallow in. And why wouldn't they be? Anyone can mope, and these guys are getting Academy Award nominations for doing it! Death and tragedy has always been a favourite of Hollywood, and the dreary and depressing nature of this film takes advantage of that fact. 21 Grams attempts to explore the subject of loss and personal trauma by way of the soul, which is shown by the '21 grams' that we lose upon death. This is extremely ironic when you consider that this film has no soul. It's backbone is dissolved into the tedious screenplay, and 21 Grams doesn't offer us a single reason to care for any of the characters on display, meaning the only reason we should get behind them is because they're the protagonists; and that's no reason to care for a character. The characters in 21 Grams can kill people, be told that they have a month to live and lose their family until they go blue in the face - but if I don't have a reason to plug into their plight, I'm afraid I simply don't care.All in all, 21 Grams is a tragic waste of film stock. It's a product of it's time and reflects the way that cinema has changed this century. It's a shame that films of this nature will continue to get strong critical reactions, and as long as that keeps happening, the studios will continue to churn them out. 21 Grams is nothing but another film.",21 Grams
20,zetes,"Drop the gimmick, and you would have had a much better film",7,1 April 2004,"SPOILERSA film that, the more I think about it, the more dissatisfied I get. My main problem with it is the achronological structure. While it works perfectly in some films (The Sweet Hereafter) and is absolutely necessary for the existence of others (Memento), I can't help but think that there is absolutely no point to it in this film, and that it could have been so much better if told in chronological order. The revelations would have been more powerful, and I think the themes would have stood out better. The structure comes off as a total gimmick, and a harmful one. For a long time, it stands as an entertaining and somewhat involving puzzle film, but the story deserved to stand on its own this time. The film also suffers from some very weak key scenes  like the plan which Watts and Penn develop (doesn't even seem in the realm of the characters' behavior). And the central event of the film is hard to swallow. No matter how big Del Toro's Jesus truck is, it's impossible to believe that he could accomplish such an impressive feat of vehicular manslaughter. Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, and Benicio Del Toro are all very good (Del Toro deserved his Oscar nomination, Watts didn't, and Penn got his for the better performance), but I also think one shouldn't overlook the lesser known actors in the film, like Charlotte Gainsbourg and Melissa Leo. This movie really survives on its acting alone. I never did get around to seeing Iñárritu's debut film, but 21 Grams doesn't inspire me to do so. 7/10.",21 Grams
21,whpratt1,Great Masterpiece of Work,8,21 February 2009,"Enjoyed viewing this film from the very beginning of the film to the end. Many of the actors gave outstanding performances in their roles and Sean Penn,(Paul Rivers) and Naomi Watts, (Christina Peck) were super stars in this story.There are many quick flashbacks, from one person to another and the director leaves the audience to solve the problems each man and woman is facing and some of the characters have deep dark secrets, with heart transplants and an ex-con who tries to find a more spiritual way of life and convert the towns he visits.There is love scenes and some very romantic scenes with Sean Penn and Naomi Watts along with other strange couples and families.

22,namashi_1,Confusing & Complicated...,4,3 March 2010,"Alejandro's '21 Grams' is a long, complicated, confusing and abstract film. Agreed, the writer-director attempted to tell a new kind of story telling, but let's not forget that ""WE' ""Regular Cine Goers' are not to used to such stuff. There is no spoon-feeding here, half the time you're wondering what's happening when and in what time lapse. It's a poor show!'21 Grams' is a tragic story of three people, who are willing to die if given a chance. The film has a confusing start, a complicated middle and an absurd end. It's the writer Alejandro that let's the director Alejandro down. The writing is flawed, that's the truth! If there is something note-worthy about '21 Grams' it's undoubtedly the performances by it's star-cast. Penn is superb, as always. He deserved all the awards he got. Naomi Watts also won a lot of awards for her performance, and rightly so. Del Toro however, is the real scene-stealer here. He's Incredible! Melissa Leo is excellent as Del Toro's wife. These performances are the sole-saving grace of this dark venture. '21 Grams' disappoints as a film, but as mentioned, the performances don't.",21 Grams
23,Smells_Like_Cheese,There's no point to it,6,18 March 2007,"I just didn't understand how this movie was so raved about in 2003, I remember it was up for some Oscars, I believe, and I heard about it from several people on how dark it was but interesting. Well, I rented it the other day and decided to give it some time to think about it, still I came up with the same conclusion, it had no point. Normally most movies have a moral or some kind of meaningful conclusion, I'm not saying that some films could be different, and we've had those types of films, but still this one just made absolutely no sense. I think because the pace was just so slow and really couldn't get to the point, I lost interest.Cristina has just lost her husband and her two daughters in a horrible hit and run accident, realizing that she would loose her husband due to massive brain damage, she lets him go and donates his heart to another man who is dying and needs a heart transplant, Paul. Paul looks her up and instantly falls for her despite being in a loveless marriage, he would do anything for Cristina, including killing the ex con who is now a religious freak who killed her family and part of her life.There's more to the story, but that is the summed up version of pretty much what it is. The acting was not bad at all, in fact I would say that is very decent, it was the story and how it was edited that didn't work for me. I think the story had some kind of meaning that could have been better explored or told in more sincere way. Doesn't make any sense I know, but I would just warn you that this movie is somewhat a waste of time.6/10",21 Grams
24,=G=,Excellent unpleasantness,7,17 March 2004,"""21 Grams"" tells a story of three people: A man who needs a heart, the widow of a donor, and the man who killed the donor. The film has critical plaudits aplenty, a couple of Oscar nom's for acting,  a fine cast, and the work of budding ""Ameros Perros"" director Alejandro González Iñárritu. Unfortunately, the latter plus is also a minus as  Iñárritu force feeds us two hours of pain and suffering with sledgehammer blows while chopping up the story a la ""Momento"" and never giving us anyone we can really care about. I double timed the last 30 minutes in X2 mode reading subtitles because I was disengaged, didn't like any of the characters, didn't care what happened, and was only interested out of idle curiosity. Good stuff if you don't mind a heavy handed approach to a morose drama of wall to wall unpleasantness with poor character development. (B)",21 Grams
25,MovieAddict2016,The nonlinear storytelling is unnecessary and the film as a whole is just so-so,6,28 April 2005,"I loved ""Memento."" The nonlinear storytelling was key to the story itself and as a result complimented the overall nature of the film; however, ""21 Grams"" features the same style of nonlinear narrative without having an actual point. This movie could just have easily been told in chronological order and it would have had the same effect. In fact, if one were to unravel it and place the scenes in order, I'm sure they'd find nothing to be surprised at: it's a fairly basic drama and the nonlinear elements, I think, are just a way of making it seem cleverer and more important than it actually is.The performances, on the other hand, are superb. Sean Penn is excellent and Naomi Watts delivers her best yet. Benicio Del Toro is quite good as well (even if his character seemed a bit reminiscent of some earlier ones he'd played) and I felt sympathy for all three, especially Del Toro, as we realize everything that happened was a result of his trying to be wholesome and ""clean."" And it backfired enormously.Overall ""21 Grams"" was a rather large disappointment when I saw it as I had heard so much hype about it. I didn't find the storytelling awe-inspiring or important, it just made the film seem showy and artificial, as if they were afraid it wouldn't be able to stand on its own as a motion picture without some type of gimmick.Recommended, but don't expect too much.",21 Grams
26,paul2001sw-1,Structure over unity,7,23 November 2007,"'21 Grams' tells of a number of loosely interlinked characters in an achronological fashion, jumping backwards and forwards over their stories. There can be reasons for doing this: for example, to reveal the plot in a way that offers an extra kick, or to enable the plot to conclude with a scene from the middle of the story that gains impact from the viewer's prior acquaintance with what happens next. Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' justified its own complex plot structure on both of these grounds. But in the case of this film, I couldn't see how telling the story in such a broken way was supposed to add anything; and the fact that most of the leading characters possess a death wish (or at least, very little will to go on living) hardly aided my emotional involvement. At times, the film appeared to be shaping into a story about the possibility (or otherwise) of redemption; but it never quite grew into anything more the harrowing tale of a number of people who suffer and (in some cases) die. The pretentious voice-over from Sean Penn's character that ends the film (and accounts for its title) felt to me like a desperate (and failed) attempt to inject some meaning into a movie strangely devoid of it.That said, the acting is good, and the film is undoubtedly skilfully made. But ""people die"" is not, in itself, an adequate or interesting unifying theme.",21 Grams
27,bowmanblue,"A hard, but rewarding watch",9,20 July 2014,"There are some films that you can watch while you do the ironing and still understand everything that is happening. Other times you can pop out to make a cup of tea and still return to the film without missing anything important. Those sorts of films have their place. They're easy-watching and won't strain your brain. '21 Grams' is NOT one of those.You have to pay attention here. For the story of '21 Grams' is also NOT told in chronological order, therefore you will frequently see things that are at the end of a two-hour movie when you're only ten minutes into the film. I mention this now because most people who talk about '21 Grams' normally mention how well acted it is and how good the story is. And, to be fair, I would agree on both those points. The acting (from the three primary leads: Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro) is as good as you would expect from three such stalwarts of modern cinema. Plus the story, regarding how the said three leads are brought together from very different backgrounds/lives through one tragic event, is also told well.However, the story and acting is second to how the film is told. Like I said... it does get a little confusing sometimes. It jumps from here to there and, not matter how much I like it (which is a lot!), I still have to be in the right mood to watch it. If I'm in any way tired or not in the mood to really think about a film's story, then I skip this film all together until I'm ready to appreciate it.Basically, it's a great drama, just told in a way that requires you to really concentrate.Also, although the three leads I mentioned get much deserved praise for their acting, it's also worth mentioning the three supporting actors (Eddie Marsan, Melissa Leo and Charlotte Gainsbourg) who all turn in equally compelling performances.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",21 Grams
28,dromasca,Best film of the year (so far),9,18 April 2004,"I enjoyed '21 grams' and it is IMO the best film of this rather dry cinema year. The film is smart, sensible, human and touching. The script tries to play with the time line, but far from being dogmatic and cold, as 'Memento' was the time line games make sense and builds a logic of the story telling that catches the attention of the viewer. Acting is very good also. Del Torro gives his best performance yet, and Naomi Watts is all you can expect in the role of a middle class woman whose life is turned into hell by accident. Sean Penn succeeds to overcome some of the clichees in his previous roles, and his act is complex and dark, fit to the pessimist vision of the director. Charlotte Gainsbourg and a few other supporting actors fill in the rest. The director of the movie, at his first American big studio movie does an original and different thing, close to the real art European cinema style. Taking a mid-level melodrama he turns it in a sensible and credible story. I can just hope that he will continue to innovate and will not fall into the traps of the commercial American cinema. The film gets 9 out of 10 on my personal scale.",21 Grams
29,ThomasDrufke,"21 Grams Lost, a Great Film Gained.",9,30 September 2014,"This is the first Alejandro González Iñárritu film I have seen. And it certainly wont be the last. He meticulously weaves several characters and plots together in this crime thriller. There aren't many people who are able to direct a film like this. The story isn't completely fresh, but the way it's put together and the execution is brilliant.Iñárritu put together a magnificent cast led by Naomi Watts, Sean Penn, and Benicio Del Toro. It was nominated for two academy awards and very well could have been nominated for 5 or 6. Watts gives another heart breaking performance and Del Toro is once again fantastic. It's the scenes in this film without any dialog that stick with me the most. The emotion or lack of emotion on the faces of the actors is unparalleled. With Watts in particular she is given several moments to show her true acting chops and give us one of the best performances of the decade, in my opinion.The plot is a bit confusing at first but Iñárritu sucks you in with each scene. There really aren't any long scenes which is one of the reasons it's impossible to step away from the film. It's a real crime thriller, but it also gives us a look at people dealing with true despair and how hard it is to instill hope again. Watts is involved in a tragedy, and subsequently Penn has begrudgingly benefited by this tragedy, all caused by Del Toro. But the great part about this film is that each character you grow to care about even at their worst moments. Iñárritu gives us a good and bad side to each of the main characters.Iñárritu truly breaks ground with this film but in the end it's almost too sad to ever watch again. His intentions are not to depress the viewer but to give us a different perspective. 21 Grams is a masterpiece of a film, but it's hardly re-watchable.+Watts is gut-wrenchingly good +Del Toro's torn character +Refreshing take on the plot twisted crime thriller +Iñárritu's perfect execution+Plots weave together nicely...-...But it does take awhile -Impossible to watch again 9.2/10",21 Grams

32,johnnyboyz,An interesting narrative and some great acting is blended in with some annoying and often obvious flaws.,7,22 October 2006,"With a twisting, entwining and entertaining narrative with some strong acting performances throughout, '21 Grams' is close to an ideal film yet there are still some things that I had problems with.The opening segments of this film are ridiculous. The film has obviously been made in a way that the viewer is going to have to see it for a second time; in fact they're pretty much forced to see it for a second time as the film gradually announces itself as a twisting, turning mess. You get the feeling it stands up and just demands to be re-watched which I really didn't like. The beginning is random, disjointed and slightly grotesque in a way. The hospital scenes are alright for a while but do we really have to see lingering, extreme close ups of breathing apparatus going 'up and down, up and down' and another shot of a human heart in a jar? It was grotesque and unnecessary.Once the film slowly gets going, we are shown scenes of what will happen in about half an hour's time. This was annoying to me as some of these 'scenes' are really, really short but there's enough to remember (be it the setting or how the character(s) looked) to spoil the surprise when the equilibrium catches up with itself. I really didn't like this at all. I think the film was challenging us to try to remember them and piece it together whilst the longer scenes were taking place but in the end; it wasn't difficult, and nor was it shocking.If it wasn't difficult or shocking, one thing it could have been was 'interesting'. I did like the way one story was starting to pull away from the other during the middle of the film. This is reference to the story around the run over family which is lagging behind the breakthrough in the replacement heart story. It fitted in well with the film and there were no silly five second long 'surprise' scenes to try to tempt you to work it out, in fact this section was probably the most formulaic of the films narrative and I enjoyed it the most.However, just when things seem to settle down a really laughable plot point crops up to do with the heart transplant story. I'm not going to spoil anything although even if I did, it probably wouldn't matter as it was such a blatant piece of writing to propel the plot; it makes me grin even now. But, following this; the film settles down into a new groove after it has deployed its scapegoat or 'parachute' of a plot device and merely sits there, holding out until the end, still showing us a little bit of character development here and there but to be honest  it's a little limp.I can't work out whether this film would be so much better or if it would be a lot worse if it was in chronological order so bearing that in mind, it's probably a good thing it was done like this, albeit it's a little weak overall. Good acting, though.",21 Grams

It used the same winning formula of ""Amores Perros"" and that was enough for me to think it was a carbon copy but with a higher budget and Hollywood super stars.To be honest, I made a big mistake. I re-watched this movie not so long ago and it totally impressed me with it's emotional content and moving sub-plots.The characters are extremely well explored and it makes you care about them and even suffer from their respective pain. The word cliché is not necessary this time because EVERY character in the movie is unique and deliver features I haven't seen before. Del Toro is fantastic as the religious freak who has lost his faith and even questions God's will. But let's face it; the main reason to watch the movie is the heart-transplant situation involving Watts and Penn. You can actually feel their pain; Watts suffering the loss from her husband and Penn's guilt suffering because of taking somebody's place and the physical consequences.This is a moving, intriguing, clever, and deep movie.

However, `21 Grams' does get you `hooker' I mean hooked right from its commencement. The film is told in a non-linear fashion that rouses viewer curiosity. It was directed by Alexander Gonzalez Inarritu whose quaint directorial techniques are of exceptional status. This `Alexander the Great' Director is one that will conquer Hollywood in the near future. `21 Grams' focuses on 3 central characters, and how their lives intertwine because of a fatal automobile accident. Sean Penn stars as a heart transplant patient , Naomi Watts as a grieving mother, and Benicio Del Toro as an ex-con turned preacher. This triumphant trio deliver 3 of the best performances of the year and all in one film. Watts & Del Toro were nominated for Oscars and Penn probably would have been if not for his Oscar-winning run in `Mystic River'. However, it was Miss Watts who has mesmerized me once again with her artistry. Wattsa a great actress she is! Also, the film's fervent screenplay by Guillermo Arriaga is vivid & heart-wrenching. Mr. Arriaga is not your ordinary `Guille' mimicker screenwriter. `21 Grams' is one the most inconsolable films of the year. In fact, any one under `21' might be too distraught by its subject matter (ok, maybe not `21'. I just had to throw that 21 in there somewhere.) I will end my review of `21 grams' before it runs to 21 pages. However, I must say that this `21' is one winning hand. See it 21 times! ***** Excellent",21 Grams

37,Chris_Docker,Successful new techniques - an interesting movie,8,17 March 2004,"Lots of awards and nominations went to this film - which is basically a fairly unimaginative story told in a very imaginative way (and with outstanding acting from heartthrob hunk Benicio Del Toro, the skilful Naomi Watts, and a remarkably restrained Sean Penn).The 'imaginative storytelling' involves a definite goodbye to linear storytelling. This is not an assortment of flashbacks, or flashbacks within flashbacks, but a jigsaw pattern of pieces from different timeframes in the characters' lives that the audience has to piece together to find out what has happened.We see Sean Penn on a ventilator, criss-cross to him a respectable cool-dude, criss-cross again to him as gun-toting nutter(?) . . . and re-criss-cross till you are forced to start thinking laterally. What happened to him to encompass such contrasts?Same thing with Naomi Watts (who played the wonderfully mysterious character in Mulholland Drive). We see her as stressed out druggie, as beautiful, well-balanced wife and mother in standard well-to-do American household, one minute her husband is there and she's obviously devoted to him, another minute she's having sexy kit-off love scenes with someone else. What???? Arrrrgh!!21 Grams however, unlike Mulholland Drive, all comes to form a whole in logical order and without repeated viewing or intense study. The pieces fall together with dramatic clarity. There's been a hit and run, Benicio is a convict turned born-again Christian, and there's a heart transplant that figures pretty centrally. 21 Grams is, we are told, the weight of a chocolate bar, but we are given to understand that everyone loses 21 Grams at the moment of death (these philosophical stretches of the imagination are a bit harder to take in, but poetically they add up, also as the 'weight of true love' for instance.)Virginia Woolf once said ""My difficulty is that I am writing to a rhythm and not to a plot . . . though the rhythmical is more natural to me than the narrative, it is completely opposed to the tradition of fiction and I am casting about all the time for some rope to throw the reader."" The same might have been said by the writer of 21 Grams. It is not obscure or impossible, but it is very creative cinematic style - be prepared to concentrate hard.But remarkable and accomplished piece of film-making though it is, the length of two hours plus is slightly overkill. Having grasped the (ultimately fairly hackneyed) story I didn't really need the point laboured for the last half hour or so, but at least it was continually enlivened by fabulous acting and script. A film I'm pleased I didn't miss, but more the entrée for a new type of dish than a sophisticated example.",21 Grams
38,MaxBorg89,"A raw, powerful, harrowing masterpiece",10,1 November 2006,"Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu first grabbed viewers'attention with his strong debut, Amores Perros (2000). He follows that compelling movie with his first English-language effort, 21 Grams (the title is explained by Sean Penn's character at a certain point of the movie), which is every bit as daring and gripping.Amores Perros is considered ""the Mexican Pulp Fiction"" due to its fractured, episodic storytelling. 21 Grams takes that narrative device and brings it to the most extreme level: the film's events are told in ""emotional"" order rather than chronological, the audience being forced to watch until the end to fully understand what's going on.Like in Iñarritu's previous movie, the main characters are connected by a car crash, although it takes about half an hour to completely figure out how: Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is a sick teacher in need of a heart transplant, and, as he subsequently discovers, his new heart comes from the deceased husband of Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts), whose two young daughters also died in the accident. The third person involved is Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro), a deeply religious ex-con who was behind the steering wheel when the tragedy occurred. He's trying to make sense of his life, a thing that won't be easy after the crash and Paul's decision to make him pay for his actions.21 Grams is more complex than Amores Perros, as scenes are played in seemingly random order (except for the sucker-punch ending). After giving it some thought, though, we realize that's actually the point, Iñarritu and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga's narrative decision serving a cathartic purpose: by seeing the movie like this, the emotional connection between audience and characters is stronger, thanks to the director's unflinching, unsentimental vision and three extraordinary performances. Penn is as intense as ever, in a turn with the same raw, brooding power he had in Mystic River. Watts delivers what has to be her best work to date (tied with Mulholland Drive), her heartbreaking portrayal of a grieving woman proving she's more than just a scream queen (as seen in The Ring and King Kong). Del Toro, playing the most difficult character, conveys the sense of vulnerability that made his Traffic performance Oscar-winning (coincidentally, 21 Grams and Traffic also share the same editor, Academy Award-winner Stephen Mirrione).Unlike other foreign directors moving to America, Iñarritu didn't pander to Hollywood conventions, but was allowed, and deserves credit for it, to pursue his own personal projects, which led him to making one of the best pictures of 2003. Like Amores Perros, 21 Grams is a harrowing, but also undeniably rewarding experience, though it isn't recommendable in case you're depressed.",21 Grams

40,EUyeshima,The Ramifications of a Hit-and Run Brought Forcefully to Life in Iñárritu's Time-Juggling Drama,9,24 January 2007,"Filmmaker Alejandro González Iñárritu's penchant for non-linear chronology in his cinematic storytelling is perhaps at its most heightened in this powerful 2003 drama. Having seen the other two superb films in his trilogy meditating on death, 1999's ""Amores Perros"" set in his native Mexico and last year's ambitiously international ""Babel"", I fully expected Iñárritu and screenwriter Guillermo Arriago to deliver something as audacious. Indeed they have with a gritty, heartfelt look at three disparate lives brought together by a single twist of fate and how each copes uniquely with the aftermath. Executed with even greater abandon than the other two films, the sequencing of plot developments in ""21 Grams"" is initially confusing, but the out-of-kilter pacing actually fits the jagged contours of the desultory story which deals with the unpredictability of life.The relentlessly downbeat tone can get wearing at least until the plot threads start to come together with greater force in the last third. The plot follows three people facing deeply personal challenges - Paul Rivers, an academic awaiting a donor for a life-saving heart transplant, as his impatient, English-born wife wants his sperm to have a baby by artificial insemination; Jack Jordan, an ex-con and born-again Christian struggling to keep a job to support his wife and two kids; and Cristina Peck, a happily devoted wife and mother who has a history of drug problems. Their lives intersect through a hit-and-run which results in fatalities and burgeoning flows of anger, guilt and resentment. Brief, time-juggled snippets of their individual lives are interspersed with obviously later scenes when the three come together under dire circumstances. Divulging any more of the story - which was apparently filmed chronologically despite the final editing - would dampen the propulsive dynamics generated by the constant second-guessing by the viewer.Fortunately, the three principals act with such fervent commitment to their characters that it is hard not to be compelled by the film in its entirety. In the most subdued performance of the trio, Sean Penn effectively plays Rivers as a dying man hoping to find some level of redemption for second chance he gets, often reacting with quiet force to the actions occurring around him. As Jack, Benicio del Toro is unafraid to exhibit the character's ugly side while sharply conveying his inability to cope with what he sees as his accountability in the tragic event. With a series of bravura moments, Naomi Watts lends palpable ferocity and a liberating lack of vanity to Cristina's inner torment. There are a couple of sideline performances worth noting as well - Charlotte Gainsborough as Paul's insular wife Mary and especially Melissa Leo as Jack's tough-minded, self-protecting wife Marianne.The film has an intentionally bleached-out look thanks to Rodrigo Prieto's atmospheric cinematography, but the most impressive achievement is the filmmakers' insightful presentation of complex, multi-layered characters in ways that make these even their more unsavory actions understandable. Unfortunately, the original 2004 DVD offers no extras, but the 2006 Collector's Edition DVD does include the theatrical trailer and an interesting behind-the-scenes featurette, ""21 Grams in Fragments"", which spends a lot of time on the director's fascination with death and his motivation in making the film.",21 Grams

We get to see episodes (not in chronological order) of their lives, prior and after the accident that intertwined their lives.There is lot of guilt, angst and drama as the characters are forced to deal with the events that follow. There are lot of feelings and stories of how you deal with such feelings. And this is the main strength of the movie. The actors perform really well, making the story plausible, interesting and above all I felt like I was a small part of it. It felt real.

Story is about three central characters who are thrust together by tragic events and must come to grips with the fate of their own actions. Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is a man who desperately needs a heart transplant or he is going to die very quickly. His wife Mary (Charlotte Gainsbourg) wants to go through with an operation to be artificially inseminated so that she can have Pauls child before he dies. Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro) is an ex-con who has found religion to help him get through life and he is married to Marianne (Melissa Leo) who is suspicious of his thinking that religion is the answer. Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts) is a recovered drug addict and married to Michael (Danny Huston) and together they have two daughters. One night Jack is driving home and runs into Michael and his children but Jack leaves the scene and goes home. After talking to Marianne he turns himself in and at this point he starts to question if Jesus is watching over him. At the hospital Cristina learns that her children have died and her husband has no brain activity. Cristina donates his organs and Paul gets a call from his doctor that a new heart is ready to be installed in him. Cristina doesn't want to press charges because that won't help her get her loved ones back so Jack does a small stint in prison. Paul is curious as to who the previous owner of his new heart is so he hires a private investigator to get the information. Paul learns of Cristina and what happened to her family and he starts to follow her and make small talk. They become fairly friendly until he tells her who he is and that he has Michael's heart. Meanwhile, Paul has started vomiting on a regular basis and his doctor tells him that his body is rejecting the heart and if he doesn't get a new one soon he will die. Paul doesn't want to wait in a hospital bed and he tells Cristina that he is going to kill Jack for what he has done to her.This film was directed by Alejandro Inarritu who caused quite the sensation when his first film ""Amores perros"" was released just a few years back. That film also had three main stories that had one event that they all shared. This film probably didn't need to be told in separate flashback sequences out of order and if Inarritu had just stuck to telling this story in the usual manner the films effectiveness would still be potent. But even if the style of the film should bother you this can't detract from the absorbing performances from the three leads. Del Toro is very strong in his role and you can see that his character is at odds with himself. He wants to be a changed man and just be a loving husband and father but trouble just seems to follow him wherever he goes. In a very good scene when Jack is in his cell he tells a priest how God has left him and Del Toro shows real rejection in his eyes. The film ""The Ring"" gave Watts tons of fame and opened a lot of doors for her and she was smart to choose this role. Here she shows that she is the real deal and can handle herself with the best actors. She's asked to do some soul searching for her character and I think she gives an excellent performance. Along with ""Mystic River"" Sean Penn gives one of the better performances of the year and its my opinion that his performance here is even more qualifying of an Oscar Nomination. The only flaw to his character is that he's supposed to be a mathematician. This does not come across as believable but its just a minor detail that has nothing to do with the actions his character carries out. Penn delivers arguably one of his best performances and it just adds to his growing legacy. Inarritu shows once again that he's one of the more interesting filmmakers to come from Mexico and his career should prove to be fascinating to follow. The superb actors that have been assembled make this film riveting to watch from start to finish no matter what order the scenes are shown.",21 Grams
44,nycritic,From the Director of Amores Perros,8,10 April 2005,"An unlikely freak accident progressively brings three people together to a gripping yet tragic conclusion.Using a non-linear exposition we are led through the three leads' existences and how one key moment changed their lives completely, and while this approach at times might hinder the film's emotional impact in lieu of cinematic technique, the story told in 21 GRAMS is nonetheless powerful thanks to the performances of Naomi Watts, Benicio Del Toro, and Sean Penn. Of the three there are no stand-outs: all bring their heart and soul into their roles and Sean Penn could have easily won the Academy Award for Best Actor for this film since here, his role is rather difficult as his is more a plot device that effectively develops motives to act the way he does later on, but since his approach is so underplayed and profoundly sad, lost at times, we feel for him even when we are led to understand his condition is fatal regardless. Watts is all-out powerful, and anyone who can recall her beginnings in grade-Z horror films will certainly see a strong actress here: to see her receive the news of her husband's death early on is a stand-alone (as an equally good Clea duVall looks on, horrified), haunting moment. Del Toro, on the other hand, has an incredible, unique way of communicating his great inner torment through little more than his sleepy eyes; I've never seen acting this subtle yet moving. Even though he's done something clearly horrible, we care more for him because of his absolute, sincere change: this is an essentially good man who made a wrong turn and has a lifetime to pay for it.21 GRAMS is a very strong movie, but at times, it comes too close to becoming too pessimistic to watch; however this is only a slight quibble.",21 Grams
45,PredragReviews,This is for those who want their grams back...,9,12 May 2016,"21 grams is an underrated gem with a splendid cast. It is one of the best movies that I've ever seen and is also one of the most original. It has a brilliant cast including Sean Penn, Benicio Del Torro and Naomi Watts. The acting alone is worth the watch but the movie..wow.. 21 grams is a deep movie and will require the watcher's full attention. It won't all make sense until the end because of the way that it is formatted. The movie is so original because it throws random scenes at the screen. One might be from the past..one from the future..etc.. For example, one scene you see Benicio Del Torro in prison, the next in a church, the next as a construction worker. One scene you see Sean Penn bleeding to death, the next smoking, the next driving his car. Now that's what is so original and genius about the movie...it makes you open your mind and the script is brilliantly conceived. You will be scratching your head at times and be like ""What is going on?"" because the movie's goal is to connect all of these scenes in the end. It makes you watching till the wonderful conclusion. The movie simply shows that fleeing in face of bereavement is as hard as fleeing in the face of death: there's no escape from it. Life just doesn't go on. There is no religion, no hope, no everyday life that can make up for the fact that one person to whom the meaning of our own person was so intrinsically connected is not there any more. Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",21 Grams
46,eric262003,Where The Emotions Grab You And Keep You Seated,8,2 November 2009,"If your looking for something standard-fare, then I advise you to look elsewhere. The movie ""21 Grams"" is a feverishly chilling and intense thriller that will lead you grasping for air, while being marvelled by the heart that was put into making this movie. The three leading performers are faced in limbo that only you and I can only dream about. But through their dilemmas, we are able to follow them through without blinking for one blooming second. The imagery and situations each of them face can be both indecipherable but also capable to keep one's brain in full effect. For those people who are dosed on Ritalin, should find another way to occupy their time because this movie isn't zooming in the fast lane. For those who are able to sit through to this psychological thriller about just how vulnerable the human race is (me guilty!) you will be left in stitches and the the story will linger on after you've finished seeing the movie. Sean Penn was absolutely amazing in this movie and was sadly robbed of an Oscar win here. A bow of shame is an order to the Oscars. Naomi Watts though she was nominated for her performance which will absolutely leave you breathless. That breakdown scenes is one of the best deliveries I have seen in a long, long time. Benicio Del Toro was also stunning as a born-again-Jesus-fanatic. I guess depressing stories bring out the best in actors, performance wise. I knew coming into this movie that I was bound for a potential tear-jerker and surely enough, this one hit the nail on the head. Even though it's unhappy and somewhat unsettling, ""21 Grams"" has some of the most believable and emotional characters ever brought together. They say this movie is best suited to its audience for the ages 16 years and up. However, I strongly suggest those who are 21 and up mainly because of the heavy graphic nature, and a long-going sex scene and the mature elements goes the far reaches of the sky. This is one film that stands on its own two feet and keeps it planted there. A film that's heart was in the right direction at the price of its loaded content.",21 Grams
47,pc95,"Good acting, but uneven",7,17 June 2006,"21 Grams has some great performances which is why it deserves to be rated a solid movie. There is a gambit of miserable emotions on display, and some interesting characters in heavy anguish and isolated emotionally. These emotions are convincing, a sign of good directing. However, the editing and the way the story is put together is intentionally uneven and is distracting. There is a clamoring for more novelty in the structure of story-telling ala movies like memento and such - which while certainly novel become laborious to watch. This movie sort of follows a puzzle piece structure - time being jig-sawed around when perhaps it wasn't needed. Nevertheless the movie is worth a sit-down for the acting.",21 Grams
48,lewiskendell,One story woven from three.,7,27 April 2010,"I didn't have many expectations of 21 Grams before I watched it, I just knew it had Naomi Watts in it and it was received reasonably well critically when it was released. What I ended up seeing. was an interesting and layered movie, that featured some great performances. 21 Grams could be compared to something like Traffic or Crash. The similarities between those three aren't really in their content, but instead stem from the way each weaves a larger story from the intertwining lives of several individuals. This kind of drama isn't really my thing, but occasionally I stumble upon an example that draws me in more than normal. 21 Grams is one of those examples. Its non-linear storytelling makes you actively think about what's going on and constantly adjust the way you look at the characters, and that's a surefire way to keep me interested. Everything rests on the performances of the admittedly impressive cast, and they deliver exactly what's asked of them. Most impressive is Naomi Watts, who continues to steal nearly every movie that she's in. She's just a great actress. And you can't forget Sean Penn, Benico Del Toro, Charlotte Gainsbourg, and Melissa Leo. You'd expect quality acting from a cast list like that, and that's what they provide. No complaints from me. As I said before, I'm not a huge fan of this genre. But I ended up liking 21 Grams more than I expected to. It's gritty and depressing, so don't bother with it if you like tidy endings or have a low tolerance for watching others be painfully miserable. Themes of faith, revenge, grief, addiction, and despair are explored extensively, but by the end of the movie there's a glimmer of hope awaiting the viewer and the characters. Just be prepared to follow them a long way down, before they find that silver lining.",21 Grams
49,Lady_Targaryen,How much does life weigh?,8,30 August 2006,"I watched ''21 Grams '' after many people (friends and dad) suggested me that the movie was great. Well,the movie is intense, depressing, but it is good for sure: all the actors were great in their roles,specially Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts. Naomi, by the way, really surprised me for good, I am so used to see her in 'cute roles', and when I saw her as a young mother, crying in the hospital scene, when she finds out that her family died, I thought that she wasn't, after all, just a pretty face on the screen. The message of this movie, is that we can lose our loved ones at any moment, and of course, we'll miss them eternally, but we must be strong and realize that life goes on, like when Christina's father suggests for her to move on,at her husband's and daughters' funeral. (And he knows what he is talking about, since he also lost his wife) Also how much we are all connected to each other and how accidents can affect all people's life, some to worst (Jack's and Christina's case) and others to a better condition(Paul's case, with a heart donated after the accident)what is the big irony of life.''21 Grams'' is a movie which interweaves several plot lines and it is edited in a non-linear arrangement, that can bother many people and make us confused in the beginning. (A good choice would be to watch the movie 2 times to get it well)The plot shows the consequences of a tragic automobile accident that changed the life of the three main characters: Jack Jordan, a former convict,Paul Rivers, a mathematics professor with a heart condition and Christina Peck, a young mother who is recovering from a drug addiction with a supportive husband and their two daughters.",21 Grams
50,bandw,I put more into it than I got out,7,14 January 2008,"This is an intense story of how the lives of three unrelated people and their families are dramatically changed by a tragic accident that links them together. The story is told in a fragmented non-linear matter that keeps your interest, but can try your patience as well.With ""Amores Perros,"" ""Babel"" and this movie Iñárritu has proved himself a master of telling stories connecting disparate people as a consequence of a random act. It is with ""21 Grams"" that he carries non-linear storytelling to a new level. It keeps your attention as you try to piece it together, but I ultimately felt that there was more technique than substance. Thinking about how the story would have come off if shown sequentially makes you think that it's not too original. So, the thing that engages is how the story is told and how much you like this film will depend to a great extent on how effective you find the method of presentation.If I am expected to have to put such an effort into following a movie, I expect something in return and I felt a bit cheated by ""21 Grams."" We take away messages that: random events can change our lives, Jesus is not always looking out for us, drug addictions are difficult to kick, heart transplants are not always totally successful, and relationships are complicated and unpredictable.The acting and cinematography are uniformly good and Naomi Watts deserved her Oscar nomination - she really put herself into her role.Iñáarritu's talent is of a high order and maybe that is why I felt, impressive as it is, I wanted more from this.",21 Grams
51,stensson,A Masterpiece,10,12 June 2004,"Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárrita now is qualified as one of the world's leading in his profession, because this is the best movie of this century so far, together with ""Requiem for a Dream"".This is a composition, both for heart and mind. It puts questions about morality, religion, ethics, conscience, bad and good, that you will be thinking over for long time, perhaps the rest of your life. Still, you feel for the people in the film. This is real life, this is people who do exist in the world of God, or in the world of nothing.Sean Penn is marvelous as he always is, but even better are Naomi Watts and the great actor and artist Benicio Del Toro.

52,valadas,"Life and death, love and marriage",8,4 August 2014,"How a sudden accident can change three families' lives. An ex-con strongly converted to religious faith knocks accidentally down and kills a man and his two little daughters while driving a van. The man's heart is donated by his widow for a transplant to another man who is at death's door thus saving his life. This fortuitous event ends by connecting the three families (one member of each one with the other two) and this develops itself in subsequent events which soon become rather dramatic mainly for the psychological consequences that the accident had for each one of them more or less indirectly. The story progresses through a very fluent succession of images, scenes and sequences in a broken chronological line with constant flashbacks and flash forwards making a very vivid and dramatic narrative as according to the plot disclosure. A very successful cut indeed. Undoubtedly one of the best movies of that year.",21 Grams
53,DeeNine-2,Intense and stark,9,26 August 2005,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Intense performances by Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro, not to mention some fine work by Charlotte Gainsbourg and Melissa Leo, make this almost too much to bear. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu throws out a line of tension and keeps it incredibly taunt from beginning to end while exploring the most fundamental human emotions: fear, love, lust, and tragic loss. He uses a technique being seen more and more in film, a technique in which the story is not told in chronological order, but temporally scattered. This technique is similar to that used by, for example, Christopher Nolan in Memento (2000) in which the story is told in reverse chronological order. Here there is a mixed pattern as the story unfolds, sometimes in sequence, sometimes out of sequence. At first it is disconcerting, then intriguing, and finally everything is abundantly clear. I don't think this technique is necessary, but it does have the virtue of forcing the viewer to become engaged in trying to figure out what is going on. And perhaps this heightens the cinematic experience.There are three stories strung together on a single strand of fate. First there is the story of Jack Jordan (Del Toro) a petty macho criminal who has found Jesus. Second there is that of Paul Rivers (Penn), a college professor of mathematics who is dying because of a defective heart. And third there is that of Cristina Peck (Watts) who has found what she wants in life with a husband she loves and two young daughters. And then there is the tragic accident that seals their differing fates, and brings horror into their lives. The story is told in starkly realistic scenes spliced in jarring juxtapositions, skipping from one character's story to the other. The effect is to give us relief from the terrible events of one part of the story only to lead into another, and then to pull away from that story and into a third until the stories appear as one.I cannot say enough about the performance of the three leads. Sean Penn is brilliant in an understated way as he projects (by turns) charm and tenderness, desperation and hope, and a kind of hopelessness headed for a flat line. Naomi Watts is electrifying in the intensity she brings to the most emotionally-wrought scenes. She is one of the most amazing actresses working today, and if you haven't seen her, see her here. You won't forget her. She was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress (losing out to Charlize Theron in Monster). And much the same can be said of Benicio Del Toro who was also nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (losing out to Tim Robbins in Mystic River). Del Toro's portrayal of a fated man who both found and lost his faith because of tragic events and his own failure of character was totally convincing and very sad.If I had to nitpick I would say that Cristina's initial feeling that she couldn't be bothered to help prosecute Jack Jordan for killing her family did not square well with her later feeling that she wanted to kill him. Yet, I suppose, one's feelings can change. I also didn't think Jordan was the kind of character who would hit and run. He takes responsibility for his actions. He turns himself in and says that he has a responsibility to God.As far as the ending goes, note that Cristina is dressed in bright, almost happy colors because of what was discovered when she donated her type O-positive blood to save Paul's life. Obviously I can't reveal what was discovered in a review, but I'm willing to bet some people found it redeeming and hopeful while others found it ironic while still others may have found it cheap and easy. Personally I thought it worked because everything in this movie revolves around very physical human events.Bottom line: may be too intense for some viewers, and put the kiddies to bed.",21 Grams
54,sme_no_densetsu,"A stylishly told story, though not entirely successful",7,7 June 2008,"""21 Grams"" is like a puzzle. The pieces are continually being put in place but until it is complete you don't know exactly what you're looking at.I won't synopsize the story in any way because putting it together for yourself is half of the film's appeal. However, I will say that, in the end, the story did not fully realize it's potential in my opinion. I got glimpses of interesting ideas throughout but the ending didn't really hammer home any kind of revelation for me.The three principle actors (Sean Penn, Benicio del Toro & Naomi Watts) do a fine job of bringing the film to life with vivid, passionate performances. It is worth noting that both Watts and del Toro received well-deserved Oscar nominations for their work.The direction by Alejandro González Iñárritu is well done, even though he favors hand-held camera-work, of which I'm not much of a fan. There is some striking imagery and one must also credit the editor in a film that uses such an unconventional story-telling approach. Also worth noting is the soundtrack which abounds in spare, dreamy instrumentation.I would have rated this film higher if I could really connect with the story but I guess that, for me, some of the puzzle pieces are still missing. Perhaps others will be able to take away from this picture what I could not.",21 Grams
55,Howlin Wolf,Pretentious and 'artsy' in the worst sense of the word; but the sheer 'force' of the storyline and performances pull it through.,8,8 July 2004,"Let's be clear; the fractured narrative added nothing, and the title is more a showy statement of sensibility on the part of the director, rather than acting as a piece of profound philosophy.  In perhaps the greatest backhanded compliment I will ever pay, though, these missteps left the actual 'tale to be told' unblemished.  Credit for that must overwhelmingly go to the three leads - this 'Wolf' singling out Naomi Watts for special praise in light of her tour-de-force performance.So don't let the fancy tricks distract you from the emotional truths herein. ""21 Grams"" is a film people are falling all over themselves to honour, and whilst I remain a little more 'circumspect' in my praise than most, I nevertheless felt enriched after choosing to watch.  Now if we could just divest Innaritu of his self-conscious habit whilst also doing the same to Scorsese and Aronofsky, we'd be set!",21 Grams

57,KUAlum26,Discordant pieces to a puzzle that the viewer must put together,9,14 January 2006,"The title might mislead the casual non-viewer. One might be led to believe the title is in reference to drugs. In fact,it is a reference to what is purported(an I have no reason not to believe)to be the amount of weight that a person loses when they die. Fitting enough,because this movie seems to be all about death, both literal and spiritual.The lives of three strangers:a dying math professor(Sean Penn),a happy but fallible housewife(Naomi Watts) and a small-time con who has found Jesus and earnestly is committed to living on the straight-and-narrow(Benicio del Toro) are about to cross paths in one terrible event. When the housewife's family is wiped out in a hit-and-run,she is mortified and crippled by this,but the by-product of this event allows for a much needed heart transplant for the professor,whose obsession with the life that gave him his new leas on life sends him searching obsessively to find it. The con,of course,is the culprit of the horrible event and is overcome with guilt and grief,even as his family and close friends try to remedy the problem and,in essence,rescue the man himself.I won't lie:the order and editing of this film by the director Irriratu is as unsettling as it is fascinating. One will either be drawn to figure this out or will be repelled by it. Sensational,gut-wrenching performances by Penn,WAtts and del Toro make this film as real and reflective. This movie will reward the viewer who wants to see human frailty and the bad choices made from it,told in believable,unflinching form.",21 Grams
58,bobsgrock,"Not what I expected, in more ways than one.",7,28 August 2008,"Having seen Babel, another film from director Alejandro González Iñárritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga, I was interested in this since that film showed they could take serious situations and turn them into a compelling and moving drama about human beings. 21 Grams does that, but not as well as Babel and in the end it isn't as moving or gripping. That is no knock against the acting which is brilliant in all departments. Sean Penn is strong as always, Naomi Watts is unbelievable to watch as a woman falling back into a life she thought she had left, and Benicio Del Toro gives the best performance as an ex-con who has turned to God for redemption but finds it hard to live that out.What really gets under the skin of the audience here and keeps you from understanding and ultimately appreciating this movie is the plot structure. In Babel, there are multiple stories as there are here. They are told out of order, as they are here. But, in Babel the stories were always moving forward, and by cutting back and forth between the multiple story lines, Iñárritu was able to build tension as well as interest in how these stories would interconnect. In this, he cuts back and forth between scenes which makes it very confusing and by the end, it's hard to remember how the stories started out. In the end, you end up not feeling the way the filmmakers want you to. It is more upsetting than convicting. Dazed and confused by the time the credits began to roll, I could only think that this was trying to be something it couldn't be; a Tarantino-like story that is more moving than entertaining. Unfortunately, only certain directors can pull off the mixed-up plot structure. Tarantino did it in Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. Here, it does not and deservedly should not work.",21 Grams
59,PatrynXX,"Powerful , though not perfect movie.",10,23 June 2004,"(spoilers)Just finished this movie from movielink.  It's a powerful movie.  I'll give it that.  It does have a few problems.  Which I'll list first.Penn's girlfriend is flip floppy.  First he wants to dump her then it's the other way round.  This is confusing.  I can't even figure out where or when she came back to him.The heavy nude scene between Penn and Watts I thought wasn't needed.  Though as a guy it obviously gave me a bit of a high ... oops.  I thought it was a little overdone.  That and they bother to show this and not the father and two kids getting nailed, or glued to the street.  So we are left wondering about that.  Yet the supposed love scene certainly leaves little to the imagination.I also didn't like (though didn't hate) the Memento style editing.  Memento was a good way to edit.  Though I still find such editing technique to be of use.  And we are left guessing what's going to happen next until the very end.  Where two surprises await us.  I think I fairly knew Sean wouldn't last.  But the other two were a surprise.This was a difficult movie to watch.  Very depressing.  Though some smiles occur towards the end.  It's gonna make it even harder for me to like Monster or Charlize.  Because so far I've found Keisha of whale rider and naomi watts to be keenly better than the stuff I've seen so far of Monster.

60,hall895,If only they'd put it in order,6,2 June 2005,"21 Grams has a very compelling story to tell. Unfortunately that story gets lost due to the frustrating way in which it is revealed to us. The story unfolds completely out of sequence and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to it. We're at the end, we're at the beginning, we're in the middle someplace, then we're back at the beginning then at the end and then somewhere back in the middle...basically we never have any idea where we are. Other films, notably Memento and Pulp Fiction, have skewed their timeline to great effect. The difference is that in those films there was some semblance of order and the viewer could always get a sense of the natural order of things. That is not the case in 21 Grams as for much of the film the viewer is well and truly lost.If put in any kind of order the story in 21 Grams would be a very powerful one. The film is very well acted. The three leads-Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro-all do a fine job. They each have very interesting characters to play, each has a lot of depth. Penn plays a man slowly dying of heart disease waiting for the transplant which could save him. Watts is the typical suburban soccer mom but we will find there is much more lurking under the surface. And Del Toro is terrific in his portrayal of an ex-con who has turned to religion and now counsels troubled youth. The circumstances that bring these seemingly disparate characters together make for a fascinating setup. But the power of the story is lost in the confusion of the way the story is told. The great performances and the great story (once you can get your head around exactly what went where) make this a worthy but ultimately frustrating effort.",21 Grams
61,gregsrants,One of the best of 2003,8,28 December 2003,"Watching the audience's response to Alejandro González Iñárritu's new film 21 Grams, I was not surprised. The theatre patrons comprised of mostly elderly individuals (probably attracted like a bug to a blue light by the press headers showing 21 Grams with multiple Golden Globe nominations). There were probably about 70-80 people in all. In the first half hour, my peripheral vision was picking up various indiglo watches with people checking the time. In the next half hour, people were talking, asking questions to their dates and escorts about what was transpiring on the screen. And by the end, the audience was about 7-10 people lighter than when the trailers were shown. Not that this is a bad thing. Actually, the exact opposite. 21 Grams, with its dark and dispiriting subject manner is one of the best films of 2003. Just don't expect to understand everything that is going on in the first 45 minutes. Shot out of sequence and using a color pallet of greys and blues, the first half of the film is as hard to follow as anything you are likely to see this year. Fortunately, the acting is so engrossing that you can't take your eyes off the screen, and slowly, your brain will begin to put the pieces together like a 1000 piece jig saw puzzle.The story in its linear sense is a familiar one. Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is an ailing middle-aged man who receives a heart transplant from a donor that was in a hit-and-run accident that also took the life of his two daughters. Paul, with his new found lease on life, looks to discover the origin of his new organ and eventually finds the grieving widow, Christina Peck, played in an Oscar worthy performance by Naomi Watts (Mulholland Falls). The two don't fall in love as much as they find a reliance on each other to help them adapt to their new environments, and within days they are living with each other, resembling two broken crutches trying to hold up a 300-pound man.On the other side of the story, Jack Jordan (played by Oscar winner Benicio Del Toro), is a religious ex-con who was behind the wheel when three quarters of the Peck family were struck down. Living a life of depression, Jack turns himself in and after a stint in prison is back on the streets working in dead end jobs, trying to get his life together while looking for meaning in his existence.It is not long before Paul's new heart begins to fail, and with his mortality staring at him head on, he abets in plan with Christina to kill Jack Jordan to bring justice and closure to all involved.This was the first English language film for writer/director Alejandro González Iñárritu who directed one of 2000's best films, the Academy Award nominated Amores Perros. As in Amores, Alejandro is able to weave multiple stories and complex characters threw a plot that eventually shows how the lives of all those involved intercept. Alejandro also has a talent for de-glamorizing his actors and in 21 Grams, he gets arguably the best performances of Sean Penn, Naomi and Benicio Del Toro's careers.The shooting of a film out of sequence has become a bit of a pattern as of late. Quentin Tarantino began the craze with Pulp Fiction in 1994, and variations have been thrown at audiences like artistic genres culminating in Christopher Nolan's 2000 backwards film Memento. But in 21 Grams, the format is both exhausted and perfected. The movie does not just flashback, but contains constant timeline jumps from past to present to future that requires a viewers full attention if they have any hopes of piecing it all together before the final credits roll.So if you don't mind paying to sit through a film that is filled with grief, despair and death, through the holidays, then treat yourself to what is one of the best of the year.www.robertsreviews.com",21 Grams

In fact, I'm thinking it's probably a waste of time to try to do so. I'll just say this:  it's not an easy film to watch on any level, starting with the confusion you will feel because of its fractured structure, and the subject matter is no picnic in the park either,  given the staggering depths of anguish that the three main characters are in throughout.

But Naomi Watts steals this show hands down. The fractured presentation works. Del Toro runs over Watts' husband and two daughters killing them. This is why the plot had to be presented in a non linear way. This gives the viewer a chance to breathe while jumping back and forth. When one's entire family is killed the plot has no where to go unless it is broken up. Past, present and future time is the plot and questions the relativity of all time.

65,ajs-10,An intense drama with stellar performances from Sean Penn and Naomi Watts,7,10 December 2011,"This film has touched many lives buts sadly not mine. This is the second time I've seen it and I must say it still hasn't gripped me in the way is has many. I can see how it might, it's a very touching story, but I guess I find it hard to sympathise, in particular, with Sean Penn's character. I will explain after this very brief summary.A group of seemingly unrelated people are brought together by a tragic accident. A man with a heart condition, Paul Rivers, is given new heart and he seeks out the family of the person that donated it. It turns out the donor was the victim of a hit-and-run accident that took both him and his two daughters. Rivers finds his wife, Cristina Peck, and together they decide to seek out the man responsible for the accident. He was called Jack Jordan, a religious man who had given himself up and had served time for this deed. His wife had hired a lawyer and got him out early. What will happen when these three collide? Well, I really can't tell you here or the Spoiler Police will be having me up for jaywalking or some other trumped-up charge.There is much I missed out of my summary, but that's the gist of it. I must admit I did find it quite confusing to watch at first because the action jumps from one point in time to another and from one set of characters to another; this makes it all pretty intense. Great performances from both Sean Penn as Paul Rivers and Naomi Watts as Cristina Peck, they both deserved all the praise they got! Also worthy of note was Benicio Del Toro as Jack Jordan, he really nailed it too! I will also give honourable mentions to Charlotte Gainsbourg as Mary Rivers, Eddie Marsan as Reverend John and Melissa Leo as Marianne Jordan.I mentioned at the beginning that I had a problem with Sean Penn's character, Paul Rivers, well, for a man who has had a heart transplant, he seems to have a death wish. Not only a death wish, but absolutely no respect for the person whose heart he now carries. What makes me believe this? Well, he spends much of the film smoking and drinking which; and I'll be very pleased if someone can tell me otherwise so I can take up the evil weed again; is really not what anyone would recommend, particularly for a heart transplant recipient. He is so self involved that he doesn't see that he's killing himself all over again Sorry, but no respect for him! Aside from that, I found this film very intense and quite compelling at times. I'm sure there are many that liked it more than me, but it still I deem it Recommended.My score: 7.0/10.IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 97,983 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 81/100 (based on 175 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

66,FilmOtaku,Not very effective,3,6 November 2004,"*Possible Spoilers*Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's film '21 Grams' is not a film that should be watched in a couple of different situations; If you are tired, if you are depressed, or if you are not feeling very tolerant of drug-addled basket cases that day. '21 Grams' features Naomi Watts as Cristina, a recovering drug addict whose picture perfect life falls apart when her husband and two daughters are killed in a car accident precipitated by a born again ex-con, Jack (Benicio del Toro). Cristina donates her husband's organs, and the heart goes to Paul (Sean Penn), a mathematician who has a dissatisfying and shallow relationship with his wife. Paul goes in search of Cristina, and the two begin their own relationship, while Jack goes to jail. In the film they say that when one dies, they immediately lose 21 grams because that is supposedly the weight of one's soul. Mine felt like it weighed about 21 tons because this film was so damn depressing. Rather than being struck with a sense of pity or sympathy however, which is probably what I was supposed to feel, I was appalled at the messes that were created by the characters. The one main character who ironically was the most blameless ended up being Jack, who murders three people. I had an overpowering urge to shake Cristina, make her blow her nose and then take the cotton out of her jaw. Paul, a man who gets a second chance at life does everything in his power to destroy it again after he meets up with her.Compelling story these actions do not make.Besides the nose-blowing and cotton-distracting thing, Naomi Watts was okay, though her whole body seemed to be set on 'vibrate' the entire movie because she was forever talking through gritted teeth and shaking. Penn and del Toro, as always, were damn good. Unfortunately they just had a non-compelling script to work with, and a confusing film to helm. Inarrito tells the film in a non-linear manner, which is normally an excellent concept, but in this case I was left saying, 'Now WHEN is this?' every time the scene changed. The confusion I experienced took away the last of anything about the film that I could have truly enjoyed.I feel the same way about this film as I did after I saw 'Monsters Ball'. I have no idea what the big fuss was about, and even though drama is my preferred genre, I had absolutely no tolerance for it in this case. I'm not entirely sure why the film was as lauded as it was, but I did not consider it good, powerful or intelligent. Stick to 'Mystic River' if you want to see Sean Penn in a good drama from the same time period. 3/10Shelly",21 Grams
67,gelman@attglobal.net,Kaleidoscope in Motion: Possible Spoilers,8,3 January 2009,"The film reminded me of nothing so much as a kaleidoscope -- shards of a story, shifting backward and forward in time, maintaining a mystery about what is actually happening until very near the end. It's an interesting approach, keeping the viewer off-balance, uncertain of where each fragment fits into the story...and when it occurs. Excellent performances by Sean Penn, Del Toro and Naomi Watts carry the viewer across the gaps until the finale. It is the cutting and assemblage of the film that makes it different. Although Penn is the principal character in the film, I thought Del Toro and Watts equaled him in the intensity of their acting. Indeed, in her grief, intermittent violence and desire for revenge, she is vulnerable at one moment, almost terrifying the next -- a perfect wreck of a human being after her husband and children are killed in a hit-and-run accident. The final scenes in the movie, set in a shabby motel, are spectacularly improbable, but necessary, I guess, to precipitate the outcome, the second death of a single heart, transplanted from the dead husband into Penn's chest.",21 Grams

The media focuses on the good news -- but for that good news some other poor person (left usually as an abstract statistic) has to die.Words, words, words. Some people will love this film because it is good (and I agree it is!) and some people will love this film because it allows them to get across their own agendas on tragedy, modern life and the search for order or sense.21 Grams is such a bleak picture that you need to watch it at the right time and in the right mood. It has a non linear technique that while clever, the film could live just as well without it. The hand held camera work and natural light work well too -- let us spin, twist, grab at information and sometimes half miss things.The acting of the three principles Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro could not be better. I don't know what this was like onset, but it must have been a hell of a movie to focus on. Tears, breakdowns and sweaty desperate sex. Where, when and how would you dare shout cut in all this -- I would love to know the director's technique.Penn is supposed to be a professor of mathematics and we learn this at a point in the movie when we have him pegged as blue collar worker. It hardly matters though. His actions in this movie show a selfishness that you couldn't really put on the written page without making him out to be a monster. Leaving one regular g/f in the middle of the night in order to spend time with another.(Yet here you can just about see his logic.) People are different people at different times. We see glimpses of the old (healthy) Penn in a scene at the table where his yuppie friends make bad jokes and then laugh at themselves. However I don't believe that these people were ever his friends -- any more than I believe that he is a maths genius.Torres won god knows how many awards in this. For him this is like Richard Harris in This Sporting Life: There won't be another part like this for him in his lifetime and he better just accept the fact! The jumpy and repeating scenes don't always totally match (should they? -- they are from differing viewpoints) and I didn't like the way the medical profession was portrayed much. They are not as clumsy and cruel as they are portrayed here.(Maybe they are in Mexico where the original script was set?) Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu has a touch of genius in his fingers -- Amores Perros is just as good as this and maybe better in having to work from his native Spanish.Where is he going to go from here? What can he produce next? I really don't know but he has a massive talent and I only hope he can find material that lets him expose more of it.",21 Grams
70,oneloveall,Powerhouse dramatics of sublime proportion,8,7 July 2006,"Riveting, deadly serious drama does not exhibit hardly a dull frame as writer/director dream team Iñárritu and Arriaga weave a potently absorbing puzzle of a narrative arc, engaging viewers until the very climax as to the chronological order of things. Never has a plot been so lovingly chopped up and edited to form a larger all encompassing whole while not seeming completely arrogant or unnecessary. Viewers might argue that the heavy reliance on out of sequence pacing yields nothing more then masked gimmickry, but to me the filmmakers clearly used this element along with the myriad of other techniques in order to support the movie's grand thematic and spiritual weight. The technical realism and immersion are masterfully complemented by the pervasive emotional integrity displayed through the drained trio of lead characters. Everyone is in top dramatic form here, but it is the unspoken moments between words that show across Benicio Del Toro's eyes and face that truly carried the weight of this film most. Ultimately this movie can work in so many different ways depending on your viewer's disposition, but at it's most base level, it is the unflinching honesty and dedication to that mysterious 21 grams itself that will carry the most weight with viewers.",21 Grams
71,jdkraus,A movie that draws us deeply into its characters and inter-weaved story,10,14 October 2012,"Inarritu is a master of depressing movies. His themes center on death/life, chance/fate, and tragedy/hope. Though dejecting, his films for me are thought provoking and masterworks. Why is that? Because they relate to life—the scenarios he puts his characters in can happen to any of us. ""21 Grams"" focuses on three lives that are affected by a tragic car accident. There is Paul Rivers (Sean Penn), a dying mathematician that is married to a heartless shrew. Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro), an ex-con who wants to set his life straight both for himself and his family. And there is Christina Peck (Naomi Watts), a stay at mom whose only existence is to look out for her husband and two daughters. All the characters seem like people any one might know. Through the course of the film, we watch helplessly as things spin out of control and these people's lives are turned up-side-down, inside-out, and then some. Rather than shown in the traditional, chronological order, ""21 Grams"" is presented in a non- linear format. The movie starts where it ends, and then jumps around, creating a sense of disorder and chaos for the viewer. This may have been done on purpose as a means to keep the film more engaging (it still would have been a great movie if it were edited in a chronological order). In my opinion, this style of editing was used to establish and re-establish the characters. It makes them more complex and mysterious for us. Bit by bit, we get to understand them a little better as the film draws to its conclusion. The performances are what really make this movie standout. I always regarded Sean Penn as a great, dramatic actor. Here, he goes through a roller-coaster of emotions that rivals his Academy Award winner performance in ""Mystic River."" It is rather unique that he does two grand performances in the same year. Its even harder to compare both roles, for he plays two completely different people, yet at the same time, he is so flawless and natural, that it makes me wonder whether he should have won the Oscar for this instead (at least he won something in 2003). Naomi Watts presents her character as the most sympathetic. Her performance no doubt will bring repercussions for anyone who has suffered a horrible tragedy in their life. Like Sean Penn, Watts displays a variety of emotions throughout the film and each one is to hilt of being realistic, whether it is fear, grief, or even bliss. She was nominated for Best Actress for this film, and she should have won. Benicio del Toro's performance pops out at as the most complicated for me though. He is rehabilitated through Jesus, yet as a father and husband, his character is borderline abusive. At the same time, he is also driven by a powerful conscience that debates whether he is good or bad for his sins. Is he worth living or dying? A question that at one point in our lives seems to haunt us and is never answered in this film. Del Toro is neither good nor evil. He is simply human. That is what I like so much about his character, and he delivers a powerhouse performance.When I finished watching this movie, I sat for almost an hour, piecing everything together; letting the story and characters sink deep into my mind. Most movies I tend to shrug off after just watching them. This one did not. ""21 Grams"" is not for everyone. The topics explored maybe too intense and the non-linear story may be a put off for some people. While this movie blew me away, it has reminded me with the notion that life is too precious and we cannot take it for granted. Unfortunately, like the characters in this movie, we do not appreciate this wonderful gift.",21 Grams
72,RJBurke1942,"Life's not only a bitch, it's not even rich, for most...",7,2 January 2007,"This narrative will not appeal to some, perhaps many. The story is interesting but the plot is fractured totally  it's as though all of the events in the story have been thrown up in the air and land to form a jumbled jigsaw. You, the viewer must then sort it out in your mind as you view each scene.To make crude comparison, it's almost like a Tarantino narrative  but high on drugs!Now, I approach each movie with my twenty-minute rule: if it doesn't grab me in that time frame, I walk away. In this case, that almost happened  but by then a sufficient number of discordant scenes had been shown, such that my interest in the characters was finally awakened.And I'm glad it was, because the acting by the three main characters is uniformly excellent, but the performance by Naomi Watts (as Cristina Peck) is outstanding. That's not to downgrade Sean Penn (as Paul Rivers), or Benicio del Toro (as Jack Jordan) at all, both of whom excel. See the movie just for that, if not the story itself.Now to the story. Once again, the director uses a tragic accident to bring these unconnected people together  three people who would have never otherwise met (Amores Perros [2000] was the first, and most recently Babel [2006] with a similar narrative hook). But, here's the crucial aspect: after the accident, the only reason they did meet came as a result of River's obsession with the identity of the man who was killed. In other words, there would have been no story if not for one man's perseverance to discover the identity of another.Is that too artificial? You can decide, should you see it. Granted life is full of coincidence and the need to know but, in the course of the narrative, Rivers seems to be doing nothing but trying to find out that truth. None of the characters appeared to be independently wealthy, especially Jordan, so the realities of the daily need to earn money appeared to be glossed over, at least for Rivers and Peck. Am I being too picky? I don't think so because if you want tell a realistic and believable story, banal questions like that must be either implicitly or explicitly answered. Hey, even a drug pusher must be shown earning his daily bread, right?Putting those aspects aside, however, the story is unrelenting with its raw emotion, psychological turmoil from all three, and the breakdown of core principles about how humans relate to each other.As you might expect, the technical side of production was handled very well, particularly the editing, and necessarily so with such a fractured sequencing of scenes. Sometimes, it was a bit of a jolt at the pace of scene change, but it is manageable for the viewer. If you get past the first twenty minutes, persevere because it is a well done movie.As to the title? Well, the rationale for that you get in the last few seconds: it's poetic but was disappointing for me. But that's the realist in me talking...",21 Grams
73,ThurstonHunger,Complexity versus complicity...,6,2 May 2004,"People who rarely if ever want to see gritty films, should skip this film.Young people who've seen few if any gritty films but were drawn to them, will feel this is a classic.People who've seen too many gritty films, will be a little underwhelmed by this.Do people whose lives already have had more than their unfair share of grit even get time to see movies?? This is one devoted agnostic who counts his blessings...and they tally up to......exactly.......21 gramsI've not seen ""Amores Perros"" yet, I had intended to catch it a couple of years ago at Cinequest and wish I had seen it then before it was coronated by so many positive reviews. High expectations are a strange sort of damnation.Meanwhile ""21 Grams"" presents its own trinity of the damned. Evidently the shuffle-edit style here was also used by Iñárritu in his first film too? About a third of the way through this, I thought it was a device (common in books well before films) to make something simple seem less so.Spoilers of sorts will follow...I remember thinking ""simple story, complex performances"" and being irritated by the incessant intercutting to scramble the story. There were some times I thought a juxtaposition forced us to make an analogy or analysis. For example, Sean Penn falling asleep in bed with one woman, waking up in another time thread with another.There were a couple other poignant points where the time tracking tricks worked, but excessive use of those tricks undermined the treats. Partially as it forces us to focus on the plot as a puzzle, rather than the characters and their tribulations.The only other thought I had regarding the jumping across time tracks was that maybe in life, and certainly in times of crises, this is how we remember what occurred. In disaster, our linear processing is thrown into disarray?Too bad the DVD I had did not come with commentary, it might have supported that theory, or shown the thought process between various cuts. But I would bet most people will grow annoyed with the style here.Others will be put off by the grit, or as some call it a sense of nihilism. I've got a bit of a different take on that, as I actually think this film was trying for a bit more redemption amidst the ruin. In fact, the way I see it each of the main three characters gets a second chance.More definite SPOILERS come now, so STOP if you have not seen the film.Of course the obvious second chance is Penn's change of heart, but that's a false and flawed second chance as we learn. Instead the real second chance for Penn is in the relationship he develops with Watts as opposed to the one with Charlotte Gainsbourg (Serge's daughter!) as his wife.The other two main characters arguably also have false second chances that are dispatched. Benicio Del Toro's real second chance comes as he grabs the wounded Penn, and drives him pell mell to help, as opposed to his earlier hit-and-run. And Watts second chance comes with her pre-existing pregnancy, and she wrongly thought she had lost her last daughter as a result of Del Toro's avoidance at the accident.But these flickerings of optimism are lost in what another reviewer here wittily posed as a veritable checklist of woes. Abortion, drug abuse, child abuse, suicide, manslaughter, allergies to hamsters, etc...The film does have enough going for it though to reward us in other ways. The acting is well above average, of the big three Del Toro took the prize. His face is severe and interesting, and did well to reflect the inner grapplings of his character. Watts when she cries out (shrieks really) for a hit on Del Toro seemed to undergo a sudden shift in her character. But her Christ-ina already had a rift built into her from her early scene at a Narc-Anon meeting. Meanwhile Penn on a bad day is riveting, and this is neither a great day nor a bad one.I do think this is a decent day for fans of Cassavettes, as this film seemed to draw from a similar well. I'm curious how much improv was allowed into the dialog. The shot centering on the grating leaf-blower worked very well, suburban unrest. Overall the cinematography was harsh, especially when using unnatural glaring light sources. The harshness complimented the film.As did the stellar soundtrack, at times I confused what I guess was Gustavo Santaolalla with Astor Piazolla. And as for tricks, the most diabolical may have been tricking me into listening to Dave Matthews. His solo song at the end, devoid of all traces of frat-funk, was quite a nice tonic to the film.As mentioned, I did see this via DVD at home, but the hand-held ""shaky camera"" is something I warn folks about since on the big screen it is a major problem for my wife and others. But she opted out under the first paragraph of this review...With characters names like ""Rivers"", ""Jordan"" and ""Christ-ina"" I had hoped we might get more of a passionate view of the gospel according to Iñárritu. Del Toro does challenge Jesus in spirit/prayer and in flesh/tattoo...but I think this film's look at complicity gets lost in the edited shuffle for complexity.6/10An unoriginal sin, but one with promise.",21 Grams
74,movieguy1021,21 Grams: 9/10,9,11 January 2004,"How do you accurately judge a movie that's not meant to be viewed as it seems? 21 Grams, by Alejandro González Iñárritu (Amores Perros), is told in a non-linear storyline. Now that's nothing new-many movies today are told like that, the most famous of which include Pulp Fiction and Memento. I had rented Amores Perros recently so I could understand Iñárrtu's style, but it was worthless. The style of 21 Grams is like nothing I have seen in film before. I'll get into it later.Three very different people are brought together after a terrible accident. Paul (Sean Penn) is a mathematician who needs a heart transplant. Cristina (Naomi Watts) is a mother mourning over the death of some of her family. Jack (Benicio Del Toro) is a born-again ex-con. All three of them, like Amores Perros, are brought together either directly or indirectly by a car accident. And, instead of dealing with love and hate, which Amores Perros did, Iñárritu deals with life and death, and how imminent death is to each of us.Instead of just holding our hands through the odd chronology (Memento) or letting all hell break loose (Pulp Fiction), Iñárritu makes everything flow in a logical sequence. He shows events that will happen: not just any, but pivotal events. Then, he takes time to show us why those events happen. What makes it even more interesting is how there no character development yet you still find yourself feeling for each one of the three main characters. In the beginning, before any of the three had met, there was probably not even four minutes spent on one character at a time before switching over to another. That's crafty filmmaking.I enjoy narration in movies. I especially enjoy deadpan narration. Although there are only a few instances of it, by Penn, it tied everything together. Another little thing I liked was the opening credit: it reminded me of older, foreign, moody movies, where the mood was dark, setting the tone for this movie. Like the theory that if you go back in time and ruin anything, it will drastically change everything in the future, 21 Grams examines people's choices, and the regret and grief that they must feel. It examines the human life.Penn, as he also did in Mystic River earlier this year, is a strong leading man. Watts is really the core of the movie. Although she cried as much as Jennifer Connelly does in any of her movies, she's the rock. However, the best actor is without a doubt Del Toro. His various changes from hardened criminal to family man, and places in between were so forceful and believable.If Focus Features plays its cards right, they might be able to take over the Oscars. They have acting for Lost in Translation and 21 Grams, along with directing, so maybe they'll knock Miramax out of their winning streak.My rating: 9/10Rated R for language, sexuality, some violence and drug use.",21 Grams
75,WriterDave,Best Picture of 2003,10,14 April 2004,"As we head into the summer blockbuster season of 2004, I am looking back now on 2003 as one of the weaker years for films in recent memory. Luckily even in an arid wasteland there can be an oasis, and for 2003 it was 20th Century Fox's art-house film division Focus Features thanks to their delightful ""Lost in Translation"" and the years most accomplished film, ""21 Grams.""At its core a motion picture is a series of scenes. Shown in a seemingly haphazard manner at first, ""21 Grams"" is a series of scenes shown non-chronologically but with an undercurrent of connectedness. Thanks to a thoughtful script and bold and highly competent direction, the jumbled scenes here involving a teacher waiting for a heart transplant (Penn, more compelling and real here than in his over-the-top scenery-chewing Oscar winning turn in ""Mystic River""), a Bible-thumping ex-con (Del Toro excellent as always), a tortured housewife grieving the loss of her family (Watts in a powerhouse performance), and the tragic car crash that brings them together, build up to a crescendo of suspense where sin, redemption, love, loss, and hatred are shown in all their gritty, hazy, and messed-up glory. Some of the early scenes reveal much, but we the viewers aren't quite sure of what we're seeing or the emotional depth involved until later scenes shed light on our previous experiences. This is definitely a movie to savor watching at home over and over as each viewing will add a deeper level of understanding.What makes ""21 Grams"" so special aside from the awesome performances (especially from Naomi Watts, my favorite actress since her career making turn in ""Mulholland Drive"") and innovative story-telling technique are its quiet scenes of stark emptiness (the abandoned leaf-blower scene) and frank intimacy (any of the love scenes) that often become blurred and interchangeable (witness the loneliness of Clea Duval as she quietly weeps in the background while her sister breaks down wailing upon news of her children's death or Penn having a post-coital smoke at the edge of the bed while Watts lies naked beside him). In the end, for all the grief and tragedy we experience, ""21 Grams"" becomes the most heartbreaking and ultimately beautiful film about loss since Egoyan's ""The Sweet Hereafter.""",21 Grams

They are, Paul Rivers (Sean Penn - Mystic River) a terminally-ill patient in desperate need of a heart transplant to live, Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts - Mulholland Drive) a recovering junkie turned happy suburban SUV-driving housewife, and Jack Jordan (Benico Del Toro - Traffic) an ex-con who is now a born-again Christian and believes God has a specific plan for him. None of these people know each other, but they all get drawn together following a horrific and harrowing event. Cristina's husband and kids are run over and killed by Jack, after a his mistake of turning a street corner too fast. Jack stricken with guilt and in commitment to God, turns himself in, but later gets released since Cristina decides not to press charges since persecuting Jack wouldn't bring back her beloved husband and daughters. Paul gets his heart transplant from Cristina's deceased husband, and later gets involved with Cristina (after Paul got information on who his heart transplant donor was). Paul feels it's his duty to do everything he can for Cristina, while stricken with grief she gets drawn back to beastly old habits. Cristina decides she wants to exact revenge on the man who took her family away from her, so Paul and her go on a mission to do that, while Jack re-examines his life as a born again and falls out of touch with god.As crafty and fabulous as '21 Grams' is, a great deal of people won't care for the film's jumbled storyline that jumps from past to present to future non-stop. The picture doesn't come together until sometime after it's over. In a way, '21 Grams' is like a jigsaw puzzle. During the movie's run you are randomly handed puzzle pieces, then at the end you are forced to put the all the different pieces together as fast as you can. The average Joe-Schmo with an I.Q. of 100 will detest this, but those like me, who appreciate, admire and adore the art and dexterity of film-making will find '21 Grams' to be a wonderful treat. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu does a fantastic job directing this masterwork, while Gulliermo Arriaga, who scripted 2000's foreign indie phenomenon 'Amores Perros', provides an exemplary screenplay that should have ripped the Academy Award out of Sofia Coppola's hands for 'Best Original Screenplay' at the Oscars two years ago, but it wasn't even nominated! The three leads turn in spellbinding performances. Sean Penn's performances oozes with painful realism, Benico Del Toro provides us with a scary but ultimately sympathetic character (that only an actor of Del Toro's caliber can do), but the feature is stolen by Naomi Watts, who near-perfectly nails the mental and emotional state of not only a struggling junkie, but someone who has lost children to tragic but ultimately uncontrollable circumstances. The movie's film editing and music score is great also.I whole-heartedly believe '21 Grams' isn't a film for everyone. If you want to see an unrealistic and uplifting movie, avoid '21 Grams' at all costs (don't even look at the cover in the videostore). However, if you don't mind a sad and painful to watch motion picture, I highly recommend you hi-tail it to the videostore (after you've seen Clint Eastwood's 'Mystic River', a similar but ultimately superior drama). '21 Grams' is about as realistic and gritty as films come, so if you are up for the task I think you'll find a lot to love about it just like I did.

78,PyrolyticCarbon,"Bear with the style and just get into the story, it's excellent.",8,2 February 2005,"I had heard a lot about this movie before it was released and was really excited to see it. The Director, the story, the stars, it all pointed towards being an excellent movie. Thing is, I never saw it in the cinema, and it's taken until now to see it on DVD.In the meantime many of my friends have seen it and I've heard differing reports, but all ranging from really good to excellent. So when I finally got hold of it on DVD I was slightly disappointed.The big problem I found with the film was actually following the story. The director and writer have chosen to make this movie quite disjointed, leaping around the timeline of the story for dramatic effect. Now at times you can understand why, and it actually aides the storytelling, there are some moments where you suddenly make connections and there's truly a wow factor. Yet for the most part of the movie there's just a feeling that this style is just totally over done.If you can put that to the side and watch the rest of the movie, you are rewarded for it. The story, disjointed or not, is really strong and engaging. As for the acting, well I'm never surprised by Sean Penn as he's excellent in everything he does, he's such a natural and restrained actor. Benecio Del Toro was just as inspiring, giving an excellent lost performance. What was the most surprising for me was Naomi Watts, I had only previously seen her in Ring and she carried the role well but for me didn't really have a chance to shine. This showed she can positively beam, and she outshone Penn in a few scenes.",21 Grams
79,tastyhotdogs,Brilliant,8,30 December 2005,"I'm not a big fan of drug movies that ending up making drugs look like fun and not that dangerous- you'll get into some wacky adventures but things will turn out OK (see ""Go"", ""Pulp Fiction"" etc). 21 Grams certainly doesn't fall into that category.The movie is built around an extremely strong story, excellent directing and an excellent cast, most notably Del Torre, Penn and Watts. The story is told out of sequence, and as the movie develops we start to see the three separate stories seem to be intertwined. Essentially the movie is tragic, and shows how lives can be ripped apart by drugs, either through addiction or even a one-off hit.It's pretty full on, but I think it's worth enduring for the powerful messages it tries to bring across.",21 Grams
80,smakawhat,Hauntingly unforgettable.,9,12 December 2003,"Alejandro González Iñárritu's 21 Grams, is a look into the lives of three ordinary people that takes the viewer on a memorable ride and leaves you with characters you will remember for a long time.  This movie already haunts me just thinking about it again.Sean Penn plays Paul Rivers, a man who is in need of a heart transplant. In an unusual set of events he tracks down the wife of the donor Christina (Naomi Watts) even though she demanded to remain anonymous.  Her husband and two children were killed by an ex-convict named Jack Jordan in a drunk driving accident (Benicio De Toro) who is trying to get back on the wagon mostly through the help of finding Jesus.  Three incredibly different people from varying backgrounds, all end up meeting in a microcosm of events, inter cut with Iñárritu's impeccable direction as the story line jumps forward and backwards, with grainy cinematography and a haunting score that sets the perfect mood.The characters all have vices, which somehow give them instant tragedy. Jack is dealing with his alcoholism, Christina returns to snorting cocaine unable to handle the loss in her life, and Paul ends up on a mission that while compassionate and caring is inherently self destructive.To make this film work, since it is so character focused, you need top notch actors and 21 Grams delivers that in spades.  The audience at times is ahead of the story than the players involved.  Then at other times you think you know what viewpoint you are watching and then realize as the film progress that you were wrong about what you witnessed (with regards to Paul's hospital bed scenes).  To some the jumping of the scenes can be annoying, at times you already understand it's effect, and some viewers will take the film knowing the ending before the film is even over.  But even with this great use of direction and it's giving away of secrets to the audience, it is truly the acting in this film that will leave the viewers wanting more. When the telling of secrets plays out the talent of the actors shines through with such impeccable precision that it is pure genius.Naomi Watts was robbed for a nomination for her role in Mulholand Drive, and if she doesn't get nominated for this performance it is going to be another tragedy.  In fact the performances by all 3 players is pure Oscar caliber and to ignore them would be an even bigger disgrace.  How these characters ache, and deal with their tragedy stretches cinematic convention like nothing I have ever seen.  It is painfully real, and brutally honest without resorting to cheating the viewer or insulting their intelligence.This ensemble performance hits with a sledgehammer of incredible tragedy and Iñárritu's masterful direction makes it one of the best films of the year. Make an effort to see this film.Rating 8.5 out of 10",21 Grams
81,flicklover,Too artsy for its own good!,6,8 February 2004,"A dying man gets a donated heart from a man that is killed with his daughters in a hit and run by an ex con.that is more or less the story.This film's story is basically soap opera, but it is told in the trendy amores perros/pulp fiction out of chronological order style. It is used too much these days, this film is a tragedy, it is told in such a heavy handed, artsy style that it is hard to watch.It's as if real emotion couldn't come thru, it has to be done with grainy photography and showy editing. Yes, the three main actors, Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro give good performances, but the movie cold and too tragic, the tone made me feel numb after a while, and it probably the directors intention.

I discuss the plot too much would give away too much of the movie, but it is basically the intersection of three lives that result from a horrific personal tragedy.The story is told out-of-order, which makes the movie - especially in the beginning - a little hard to follow.  I have always liked that out-of-order story telling device, so it didn't detract from me.  It creates an interest and anticipation to see how the characters get to the place that you have just seen a glimpse of.The story telling itself is well done.  The pacing, editing, acting and cinematography - which looks like it was done with a handheld - all add to superb cinema.It is a depressing plot line and this is likely to be disqualified from being a great ""date movie"".  If you like hard-hitting, genuine drama with no audience manipulation, you will love this movie.If you like this movie and don't mind subtitles - for those of us English speakers - rent ""Blue"" with Juliette Binoche.

Question: Who is Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu? Answer: A young, internationally acclaimed Mexican director who comes to Hollywood and gets the opportunity to produce a film where he directs three of the finest actors around with a flawless and powerful script.Going from a reported budget of 2 million dollars for Amores Perros to 20 million dollars for 21 Grams, Inarritu succeeds in his transition from Spanish to English film in every imaginable aspect. Amores Perros was one of those hip breaths of fresh air which wooed audiences across the planet, swept the Mexican Ariel Awards, won twice at Cannes and was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film both at the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards. 21 Grams is simply better.Using a nonlinear approach pioneered by Quentin Tarantino [Reservoir Dogs (1991), Pulp Fiction (1994), Jackie Brown (1997)] and seen more recently in Memento (2000) as well as Amores Perros (2000), Inarritu digs deeper with a very explorative and emotion-filled script. Life, death, guilt, regret, love, lust, religion and redemption. All themes intertwined so sublimely in the three merging storylines. Supported by terrific acting and a rock-solid script, Inarritu builds up a crescendo of thoughts and emotions in a visually pleasing experience. Very life-like, very intense.Oscar buzz? Sure thing. Best Film (Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu), Best Director (Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu), Best Editing (Stephen Mirrione), Best Original Screenplay (Guillermo Ariaga), Best Actress in a Leading Role (Naomi Watts), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Benicio Del Toro) and maybe even a nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Sean Pen) or Best Cinematography (Rodrigo Prieto). The only category it can't be nominated would be. Best Foreign Language Film.Well maybe with his next picture when Inarritu decides to direct in. French or Japanese. why not? This guy is talented.Enjoy and cherish this gem.

For some, this shuffling of time events may be irritating , and once the everything is revealed , the completed picture might not look quite as impressive as its out of order timeline originally may have promised. But the process is all, moments of horror and bleakness maybe best told in this way. Great movie.",21 Grams
86,Pookyiscute,"Very, very enticing",8,8 February 2006,"After the first thirty minutes, you might want to turn this off, because it's a little confusing and the editing goes here and there, and doesn't exactly stay in one place at one time. However, after those thirty minutes, you start to understand what is going on, and how each scene effects the story.It's hard to explain just what this film is about without actually ruining the plot, but it's good enough to sit through those first confusing thirty minutes. Naomi Watts was outstanding, and right on in every single scene. Sean Penn was excellent as usual, but Watts and Del Tero were the stars of this film. I know that they were both nominated for this movie, and in my opinion they both should have walked away with the Oscar that year, for their performances, because they were so amazing. I haven't seen a performance like Watts' in a long time, and she was terrific to watch.I give an 8 and not a 10 because there are scenes which are a bit confusing, and there are times when you are totally lost and it's hard to follow, but I liked the fact that there was very little music, and more focus on straight acting, and story telling. The directing was good, but it could have been presented I think, in a little less of an artsy aspect.I'd say if you're a movie buff, like I am, you should definitely check this out. No one under eighteen should see it, for drug use, nudity, sexual topics, and other things that aren't suitable for underage adults.",21 Grams
87,tnrcooper,"As the Guinness ads say ""Brilliant!""",9,6 March 2004,"Excellent film.  Inarritu is gifted.  I'm always on the look-out for his next project.SPOILER ALERT
The one note that rang a little falsely for me was how quickly Naomi Watts' character got together with Penn's after she had initially rejected him when he told her he had her husband's heart.  Then again, certainly when you are traumatised as she was, perhaps that is reasonable.The acting is second-to-none.  Glad to see Benicio del Toro back to his top form which he displayed in Traffic.  He was excellent and played his character with some restraint, as did Sean Penn, which only increased my appreciation of him.  Both underplay to allow the stage to Naomi Watt, who holds it superbly.  Her performance is fabulous.  The scene that stands out the most to me is when she was standing in her living room by herself after her husband and kids had died and breaks into tears which seem to take over her.  Were it not for Charlize Theron's performance in Monster, she'd have been the fave for Oscar this year.I don't see the need for flashbacks in this film.  A couple of times I was mildly thrown off trying to determine if the scene had happened before or after something else.  Having said that, it works anyway.  Excellent film.",21 Grams

Respect due to Sean Penn , Naomi Watts , and Del Toro for giving burning performances that stay fixed on the mind for long time after to come , the film never tore away from its theme at all which made it even better and not confusing at all but however it also created such a huge level of empathy that I personally found it very difficult to pick a favourite character - NOT MANY FILMS CAN DO THAT .

The heart of that man will save Sean, but Mrs Peck has lost her husband and wants revenge, thing that Sean will give to her. A very sad film where religion, fault and duty are mixed in a very complex film with a very daring making. Actors are very good (two Oscars nominations prove it) and the story is touching and catching. The way of telling us the story, with continuous flashback, back and forth, can make it very difficult to understand completely, as we cannot follow very well what is happening at every moment.

90,CineCritic2517,like a 20 year old can of beer: it's flat and it stinks...,4,7 March 2007,"5 hours of my life I'll never get back.Just having seen Babel only last week, I was looking forward to Grams as many claimed Babel was only a poor sequel to it. The reason I find this in error is not a redeeming feat to either one of the movies.Grams is pretentious and as flat as artsy movies get (or Soap-opera's for that matter). And it is my profound conclusion that the lack of any substance in this movie and the strong hint that it really is there, is the reason people think this is a good movie. There is a name for this phenomenon and it's called attribution.Unlike the Pulp Fictions, the Magnolia's and what more, Grams's non linear build up seems random and contrived in a way Nolan would have done it, which is not a compliment. A relative simple story is being cut into some dozen scenes and are numbered. The numbers are placed in a hat and are taken out to determine the order of the scenes and voila; Gram's is born. Face it, without this artsy scene cut up, this movie falls flat on its face whereas e.g. Pulp Fiction or Magnolia would then still be enjoyable.Aside from this, the stories which this movie deals with and much of the screenplay are truly just on par with any Soap. I can safely say I have more fascinating or otherwise interesting situations at my place of work on a daily bases, and I work in IT for crying out loud. What is so interesting about a hit and run tale or a guy with an other guy's heart when everything about these people's lives, thoughts and God knows what else, is being spoon-fed to you in an over-dramatic way? No wonder it took Iñárritu close to 5 hours to get it all across. Oh, it was only 2 hours? huh, really??Seeing Babel, I liked the scenery, and the soundtrack in combination with the cinematography was incredible. The three tales in it spoke for themselves although much of it was pretty black and white. But at least it wasn't pretending to be more than it was at the cost of enjoyment.Grams is a completely boring and uncompelling story about people who are instantly forgettable because we have seen them all before. Much of the character's actions are either clichéd or too unsympathetic to be gripping. The movie plods so much that it actually slows down real time, the story jumps around like a frog on speed and the soundtrack, if you can call it that, didn't take more than 1 guitarist recording some feedback from his guitar while he was taking a nap on it.3/10 for the otherwise fine editing and acting of a pretentious mess.",21 Grams

At times showing a movie in mixed parts can work, but this one was not one of them. This movie was shot chronologically but split up and chopped up and shown at various times. The ending is told before the beginning trying to build up your interest, but for me all it did was tell me the ending and made me wait to be told what I basically already knew.****possible spoilers **** Sean Penn plays a man who is dying and needs a new heart, hes sad and miserable and lives with a woman who he no longer loves. Benicio Del Toro plays an ex-con who has found god and tried to change his life around,. He has gotten so religious that he has put god before even his family, which makes his wife and their 2 children feel secondary. Naomi Watts plays a former junkie who found love and now raises her two girls and has changed her life around and is finally happy.One day while walking home from an outing with his children Watts' husband and children are killed by Del Torro in a hit and run. Watts' husband was a donor and suddenly Penn ends up with a heart.Penn becomes obsessed with finding out who his heart belonged too, Watts turns back to drugs and Del Torro turns himself in against his wife's begging him to stay and be a father and husband. He turns his back on his family and ultimately feels god has betrayed him....This is where the story gets good and all three lives come together...bad thing is you know from the first scene of the movie that these people knew each other...***end of spoilers*** The acting is good Sean Peen, is always able to pull off a role, Benicio Del Toro is once again brilliant and Watts might've possibly given her best performance here.. All the acting was great and I thought the best acting was done by Melissa Leo. Leo had auditioned for the role and lost to Katrin Cartlidge, but Cartlidge died and Leo got the part.. she was the best here, really seemed to nail that character on the head, perhaps one of the best casting choices EVER in film history.Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and writer Guillermo Arriago team up again, they gained a massive following after Amores perros (Love's A Bitch). Most of this film was shot with a hand held cam and I loved the gritty look it had, it was very beautiful and different.My favorite thing about this film was the religious aspect... A man in prison finds god and then realizes later that you can still screw up, you will still be judged, you will still have anger, you will still be human, and although having god in your life may make you better in many ways, it wont save you or protect you from the ugliness of the world..It was a good movie as far as dramas go, not loving the way it was presented to me, but I did enjoy it, absolutely great job with casting, the look of the film was good.. 4 out of 10 stars, because I do feel it could've been better.",21 Grams
92,JoshtheGiant,"Horrible to Watch, But You Can't Turn Away",10,13 January 2006,"21 Grams is likely the most disturbing film I have personally ever seen, and one of the most powerful. It is filled with wonderful performances. Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro give powerful performances but it is the wonderful Naomi Watts who blows you out of the water. Her performance is easily the best of the year and one of the best of the 2000s. She brings her character of Chris to life so perfectly, and so wrenchingly it is almost impossible to watch but like the rest of the film you just can't turn away though you want to so much and it almost hurts to watch. The direction is also some of the best in years, maybe since Schindlers List. He directs it like all the foreign films he did before this, in fact its so much like a foreign film that you sometimes think about how well dubbed it is, and then you think about it and you realize. The screenplay is also wonderful, its character development is flawless and the plot is nearly so. The editing and cinematography are both also flawless as is the dialogue.

93,grahamclarke,Marathon Master Class in Acting Anguished,6,3 March 2004,"Taken scene for scene, 21 Grams has much to offer being well shot, directed with an assured hand and boasting three outstanding performances from Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro. The problem however is twofold. There's the method as to how these scenes are strung together and then there's pacing of the film as a whole.The story is straightforward and simple. There simply is no justification for having it served up in a jumbled and illogical chronological order. Nothing is gained by this other than annoyance to the viewer.The three main characters are people who have been traumatized by the hands of fate and all pretty much at the end of their tether. There's no let up in the intense and feverish emotions on display. After 125 minutes you might find yourself close the end of your own tether. It's like hearing Jennifer Holliday singing ""And I'm Telling You..."" in a constant loop. There's no way any kind of climax can be effective since the entire film is played at such a high pitch. It's exhausting and frankly tiresome watching what is in effect becomes a marathon master class in acting anguished.The performances are flawless, but director Inarritu does not allow the viewer to muster up enough sympathy for these characters in order to make one really care. When all is said and done, not much is gleaned from 21 Grams other than what we already know; life for some can be an unfair hell on earth. The question remains as to just how necessary it is to sit through 24 Grams to have this reiterated, despite the clear merits of this exercise.",21 Grams

The movie takes you to the journey of three souls who collide into each others' lives coincidently. These are the lives driven by different factors; loss, loneliness, guilt, love, revenge etc.. It is a philosophical journey, slow moving, following a non-linear narrative requiring your full attention and patience. What makes it outstanding and unforgettable is the unmatched performances by its lead actors especially Naomi Watts. She makes you feel pain that sucks your bones. It is another ground breaking performance of her after Mullholand Dr. Dialogues are written with special care on what they mean and you would like to rewind few times to listen them again and understand their deep rooted meanings.Don't miss this moving drama if you are interested in understanding the ironies of life.",21 Grams
96,blakiepeterson,A Superbly Acted But Maddeningly Edited Drama,6,2 May 2015,"21 Grams is about sad people doing sad things, wishing they could be a different sad person for just a minute so that they can escape the pain they so constantly feel. Their lives never pick up — they were never that great to begin with — and so the film acts as a mangled study of truly messed up people, sometimes compelling and sometimes so downbeat you may as well give up and moan into a judgmental pillow. It is not a film to lift your spirits; see it for the emotions it brings, the jaw- dropping performances it contains. When reflecting on our pampered lives, the fact that people like the characters in 21 Grams may exist reminds us how lucky some of us are, even if our ease is short-lived or tinged with a little bit of depression. We don't look down upon these people; we emphasize with them. Told in a non-linear fashion, 21 Grams focuses on three characters with the fixation of a subtle Altman film. They are Paul (Sean Penn), Cristina (Naomi Watts), and Jack (Benicio Del Toro). Paul is unhappily married to Mary (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who longs for a baby but is rendered hopeless due to Paul's dangerous heart condition. Cristina, once a happily wed woman with two lovely young daughters, has lost her husband and kids in a bloody hit-and-run, turning back to past drug addictions to make herself feel something besides nothing. Jack is an ex-convict who is trying to curb his criminal and alcoholic ways through faith, but is failing miserably. These people are all connected in some way or another, but to reveal the source of their crossing paths would strip the film of the pleasures you won't have.Despite being one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen, 21 Grams is still one of the best acted, bringing together a magnificently emotive ensemble and giving them what are perhaps the most rewarding (at least to watch) roles of their careers. Penn is a man torn between two equally devastating lives: in one, he is a sick man with a desperate wife clinging to his side; in the other, he is the co-dependent to a mentally unstable drug addict. Watts, in a performance so harrowing it would be a wonder if she didn't suffer while piecing together her characterization, is gut-wrenching as a woman so broken that we can only ask ourselves why she isn't shattered into a million pieces below our feet. And Del Toro is an embodiment of human suffering as a man who wants to atone for his sins but falls immediately after he stands up once again.Everything about 21 Grams is phenomenal, but despite its triumphs, I still have reservations about González Iñárritu's decision to edit the film in inconsequential order. Some movies have done it well (Memento, without a doubt), but in 21 Grams' case, it's a loud concern that undermines the connected stories. Because we don't get to see characters develop in the usual sense, it's harder to grasp them as people, grip their personal stories as if they are our own.If 21 Grams isn't perfect and isn't tempting to embrace, that's beside the point. This is a frustrating but visceral film that overwhelms us with its sorrow, its despair. It doesn't feel good, sure, but one rarely gets the opportunity to experience something this exhilarating.

97,ozjeppe,The gritty jigsaw puzzle of life in a tour-de-force to remember,8,4 August 2004,"There's enough grief, pain and anguish to smother any audience in this first American feature of formidable Mexican team of writer Arriaga and director Iñarritu. Again, as in the screen immortal 'Amores Perros', the concept of the impact of a car accident, and how horrifically it affects the people involved, serves as the forceful- and totally credible catalyst. We are immediately drawn into its complex serpentine story of the gritty jigsaw puzzle of life, and the ride is a tour-de-force to remember for a long time.Not for the sensitive- there are few moments of escape from the dark rawness of emotions pouring out. Although dour and heavy, it still carries a final torch of light in the blackness for us to leave the theater shaken and moved, yet not in total resignation.Grainy, gritty visuals, and full of tilted jump cuts- long gone is the splashy flamboyancy and scenery of 'A. P', but it fits the intensity perfectly; the images breathing us right in the face.

A very dramatic movie, not over saturated with many different actions, but interestingly put together by using various scenes from the past, the present and the future, so the viewer can keep guessing and trying to figure out the movie while watching.The movie definitely has style, the story is nothing if told plainly, the director shows you the events before, then lets the viewers form associations later on, when the story unfolds. The plot itself is just that of a typical love - revenge movie and wouldn't be interesting, if not for this idea.Big plus for the movie was Naomi Watts and Sean Penn in two of the three leading roles, not to say Benicio Del Toro wasn't good, but these two were just excellent, this kind of movie really needs to have strong actors, since it isn't basic and linear.All in all not a typical movie, definitely not for everyone, i can imagine the first half of the movie putting many people off, because of the unclear plot and direction of the movie, it might seem boring for some. Couldn't say i am a huge fan of this film. There were some parts i didn't really enjoy, but anyways it came together into a beautiful and dramatic movie, so it was worth watching after all!",21 Grams
99,ilovedolby,"An astonishing blend of outstanding performances, superb direction and a remarkable story.",10,27 January 2004,"Alejandro González Iñárritu, acclaimed director of `Amores Perros,' brings us `21 Grams'-a film so utterly moving and shocking that we cannot pull ourselves away from it. Its story questions so much of a persons choices from guilt to shame to love. Moreover, the filmmaking style is terrific. The story does not play out from point A to B. Rather, it is a series of scenes that are flashbacks, not in correct order. The end result is an astonishing blend of outstanding performances, superb direction and a remarkable story.	Through the intermingled scenes, we piece together the story of Paul Rivers (Sean Penn), who has to undergo surgery for a heart transplant. The heart that he gets was formally of a man who died when he and his two daughters were struck by hit and run. Paul feels it necessary to find the donor's family as a matter of respect and thanks. When he does, he does not let the widow Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts) know specifically who he is, or what he wants. Rather, he offers his help as a friend as she struggles with the pain of so tragic a loss. As time goes on, he finds himself falling in love with her and admitting that he carries her dead husband's heart. Naturally she feels a great deal of anger about it, but she cannot deny that she finds herself falling in love with Paul -the conundrum being that Paul holds a piece of her former loves being. Wanting nothing more than revenge, they seek out the man who committed the hit and run. He is Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro), a man who admits to his wife that he committed the crime and feels shame and guilt for his act. Being a reformed Christian, he turns himself into the authorities for his act and after his sentence ends, he goes home but cannot escape his guilt. He decides to leave his family and find something in life that can help him come to terms with his unending shame. But in order to find that, he will have to face his past one more time with a confrontation with both Paul and Cristina. Although it may seem confusing, the filmmaking style is a puzzle that must be solved by the audience. At some points, we jump ahead by several scenes and see the future before we find out how it happened. It is a remarkable form of editing, unconventional as it is. 	The performances in `21 Grams' are marvelous, in particular Penn whose performance in `Mystic River' was equally engaging. It seems that no matter what the man acts in, good or bad film, he handles it with such grace and effort that sets him apart from so many other actors. Penn is in fact, one of the best actors in the whole film industry. 	Thank God that Del Toro and Watts have finally returned to making goods films. I was especially disappointed with Del Toro in one of 2003s worst films, `The Hunted.' However, he is such a wonderful actor that forgiveness must be applied. In `21 Grams,' we can feel his anguish and his internal struggle to forgive himself for the horrible acts he committed.	As for Watts, she delivers such a powerhouse performance that it drives the audience to tears. Her past haunts her and will not let go and we hope that she can find some resolve for her loss. 	`21 Grams' is a must see film that is easily one of 2003s best and beyond. ****",21 Grams
100,lotus_chief,"Tough to watch, but you MUST WATCH",9,9 January 2004,"***SPOILERS BELOW***The trailer was VERY interesting...and seeing that Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro were in it, I just had to see it.  Needless to say the acting is absolutely first class.  I have a hard time deciding which Sean Penn performance was better between this or Mystic River, but I would have to say Mystic River.  Naomi Watts was wonderful in her role...her scene with Sean Penn talking about killing Del Toro was VERY powerful and heartbreaking...she really got the role down.  Del Toro was VERY GOOD as well, reminding me of his Traffic days.  He was wonderful as the troubled ex-con.  The one scene that stands out with him is the one when he is in jail talking to his reverend/friend.  He REALLY got me with his performance there, as with the whole film.  Sean Penn was again marvelous, but in a more subtle way than in Mystic River.  All three actors balanced each other very nicely and they all carry the film effortlessly....it's really a sight to see.I asked my girlfriend what she thought of 21 Grams as we were leaving the theater, and she said, 'depressing'.  That about explains it.  It's very tough to watch, physically and emotionally.  The jigsaw puzzle style takes a while to get 'used to', and I will admit that it rendered the film a little slow and uncomfortable for me for the first 20 minutes or so.  In retrospect, this tactic is ingenious, as it slowly builds giving the audience little bits of information, teasing the viewer with hints of information relevant later on.  People may criticize the broken aspect of the film, but its not as drastic as one would think it is.  Overall it helps the film, and definitely gives the viewer the depressing, confused, hazy, disjointed feeling exhibited so well by the characters involved.  It's really something to experience.Sadly I feel this film will be snubbed come Oscar time.  Penn practically has his Oscar vote for Mystic River....at least the National Board of Review recognized his efforts for BOTH Mystic River and 21 Grams.  Naomi Watts deserves a Best Actress nomination, and Del Toro deserves another Best Supporting Actor nomination...he was magnificent.  The acting carries this film, but the story is very touching and grabs you in the most personal, deepest places; its unrelenting on the soul.  A must see...one of the best of 2003.***1/2 out of ****",21 Grams

There is a untrustworthy academic with a terminal heart condition, a soccer mom with substance abuse history and an ex-con who is reborn through faith.

102,Gideon24,An Undeniably powerful story,8,16 December 2015,"An undeniably powerful motion picture experience, 21 Grams is a blistering and mesmerizing look at the lives of three people whose lives are affected by faith, power, courage, addiction, the consequences of moral choices and above all, the power of guilt.This 2003 film centers on three characters: Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is a mathematician who has had a heart transplant which has affected his decision to have a child with his wife (Charlotte Gainsbourg) via artificial insemination; Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts) is a suburban housewife and mother of three struggling with cocaine addiction; Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro) is an ex-con trying to start his life over again through his discovery of born again Christianity. The story brings these three characters together through a horrible accident, which affects all three people in profoundly different and surprising ways. Reviewing this film without including major spoilers is difficult.Director Alejandro Inarritu and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga have constructed an initially confusing story because in the style of Quentin Tarantino, the story is told out of sequence and the screenplay takes a little too long letting us in on what parts of the story are the past and what parts are the present. But as the story begins to come into focus, we can't help but become completely invested in this tragic story. Another effective storytelling tool is that the accident that is the linchpin of the entire story, is never really seen, just giving the life-altering event even more power. Every scene of the film provides importance information, no superfluous waste of screen time here.This film had my stomach in knots for most of the running tine, had me on the verge of tears, but most important of all, never allowed me to take my eyes off the screen.This gritty and uncompromising drama is anchored by three superb lead performances. Watts and Del Toro both received richly deserved Oscar nominations. Del Toro is especially brilliant, in a performance that easily trumps his Oscar-winning work in Traffic. Penn actually won the Oscar for Lead Actor the same year for Mystic River, but I am now wondering if he should have won for this film instead. Not for every taste, but fans of Tarantino and Robert Altman will have a big head start.",21 Grams
103,nigelmacdonald-97173,Overrated pretentious twaddle.,2,31 October 2021,A waste of a good cast. The editing is all over the place which makes it unnecessarily confusing. Add to that a boring and depressing story and of course it'll win loads of awards. Doesn't make it a good film though.,21 Grams
104,Ronin47,"No ""Amores Perros"", but a hell of a movie (***1/2)",8,8 January 2004,"""21 Grams"" is the second film by hugely talented Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, his first film being 2001's ""Amores Perros"", one of my favorite films of the last 5 years. Like that film, ""21 Grams"" is an incredibly tough and gritty drama about a few disparate characters whose lives are unexpectedly united by a horrible tragedy. Like in ""Amores Perros"", that central tragedy is a car accident. Christina (Naomi Watts) finds out that her husband and both daughters were hit by a car and are dead. This sends her spiraling into a self-destructive depression, and back to her cocaine addiction. Watts gives what is by far one of the best performances of the year. You can literally feel her pain, her rage, and her suffering coming through the screen.
There are 2 other central characters, played by Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro. Penn plays a mathematician with serious heart disease, and Del Toro plays a born again ex-con trying, and mostly failing, to put his life back together. I would go more into their characters, but I think to reveal how they fit into the story is giving away too much. The most challenging aspect of ""21 Grams"" is its structure, which is literally like a puzzle. It's made up entirely of short scenes, no longer than a minute or two (and frequently less) each, that are completely out of order. Meaning that we are seeing the beginning, middle and end of the story all at once. It's incredibly confusing at first, but once you get used to it, it's exciting to watch all the pieces fall into place, especially once you realize that it's all building to a crucial, violent encounter in a dingy motel room. We've seen what leads up to it, and what follows it, but what exactly happened in there? While in my opinion ""21 Grams"" is not quite as amazing as ""Amores Perros"", it is still a hell of a movie, with 3 of the best performances you've seen in a while. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is on his way to greatness.
But be forewarned: this is no easygoing popcorn movie. It's a depressing, heartbreaking and raw film, and an extremely powerful one, too. Perhaps the guy leaving the theater in front of me said it best. ""I was drunk when I went in there, and now I'm sober.""",21 Grams

106,arthera09,here we see that movies can have,8,22 April 2007,"I loved this movie. There was almost nothing wrong with it. The only reason I gave it an 8, was the movie had little to do with the title and I feel as if it has added for nothing. The movie had enough brevity that it did not need it. Trying to make Sean Penn a mathematics professor was almost laughable. I am currently working on a PHD and I do not see any type of personality of a mathematician in him. The speech he gave Niamo Watts was silly and not convincing at all. I could have written a better math speech, but other than that the movie was amazing. This is one of the few movies where the editing made the movie. The acting was totally unbelievable and I think we see a whole slew actors really showing their acting muscles. It was extremely powerful and was envisioned in the perfect way. My favorite scene and this may sound perverted but the scene where Sean Penn and Niamo Watts have sex. I though Niamo Watts did a fantastic job acting in that scene. You could really see her pain and pleasure. I think it was a sex scene that was necessary and well done. I cannot wait to see Babel and I hope to see him growing up as a director. Del Toro was top notch in this and I think I may watch Traffic for the soul reason that he is in it.

Naomi Watts gives a breathtaking performance about a woman who lost her husband and two daughters in a hit & run accident, and Sean Penn (in a performance far superior than his award winning turn in Mystic River) portrays an ailing man, who receives new life with the help of the late husband's heart. It's this chilling reality that brings the two closer, while the collapsing Watts seeks revenge for her loss.

But as the film continues the story comes into clearer and clearer focus, the characters get more interesting, and when you see the ending, especially the film's last speech, you suddenly ""get"" why the director chose to do this to you. All the flipping around is suddenly given an excellent context.It does have some really good performances by pretty much everybody in it. Sean Penn, Naomi Watts & Bennicio del Torro (sp?) are the big names, but all the supporters are strong too.I do recommend it, simply because it exercises your attention span.

Oh, and now its in the face of the distraught man who has done the hit and run. Welcome to grief tourism. The bus leaves in half an hour. Amores Perros, the director's previous excellent film, worked because Mexico City is clearly somewhere he understands. That film was about life, and the camera just let the story go. This film has as its backdrop an independent cinema America of suburban isolation and working class squalor, and characters who tell people about their jobs but don't ever seem to be doing them. In short, the film has no sense of place - and this dislocation only highlights the real problem.  The difference between real life and film is a script. As we know, life doesn't have one. Trying to hide this by modern cutting and soap opera style big sob situations does not make the film anymore real. The plot tries to go to a couple of places where reality just wouldn't follow, and what we are left with is a lot of good acting and a sense that this should be a strong film. You might lose 21g when you die, but I'm sure I weighed the same leaving this film as when I came in.",21 Grams
111,highwaytourist,"Well acted and intense, but too long and hard to follow",6,27 May 2012,"This story was very moving at times, but the good scenes and performances are undercut by pretentiousness. It's about three very different people whose lives collide due to a tragedy. The main protagonists are Paul Rivers, a seriously ill math professor in a failing marriage (Sean Penn), Christina Peck, a beautiful, affluent wife & mother who is a recovering addict (Namoi Watts in the best performance of her career), and Jack Jordan, a devout Christian ex-convict (Benecio Del Toro) who is struggling to support his family. The tragedy involves the death of Christina's family, which devastates her and threatens her sobriety. The themes of struggle, despair, and lost love are beautifully captured. All of the actors give great performances, especially Melissa Leo as Jack's devoted and pragmatic wife. There are other good touches, including Spanish music score and bleak, faded photography which suits the mood ideally. The big problem is that the filmmakers decided to be ""artistic"" and jumbled the time sequence. There are so many flashbacks and flash-forwards that I had difficulty keeping track of the stories. The fact that this is a multi-character ensemble drama made the technique even more exasperating. Add that to a running time of over two hours, and much of the impact is muted. If they had told the story in a logical way and eliminated a few flashbacks, it would have been a classic. Instead, it's a near-miss that cheats both the cast and the audience.",21 Grams

Using the same plot device, the pair make a less showy, more deliberate return to the themes of love, loss, despair and redemption.It takes a while to get used to the story as it jumps between beginning, middle and end, but the rhythm is easy to pick up simply by tuning into the performances of Penn, Del Toro and Watts. The acting gives the movie its power (the only duff note being the irritating Charlotte Gainsbourg), and though its as sombre as hell, it never allows the audience's attention to waver.Unlikely to have anyone rolling in the aisles, then, but a thoughtful drama that deserves all the plaudits it gets.",21 Grams
113,Panterken,Brilliant acting,8,27 November 2006,"21 Grams is a film by the ambitious Spanish director Alejandro González Iñárritu, who made the masterpiece 'Amores Perros' Or 'Love's A Bitch' ( loosely translated) some years ago. Although 21 Grams at no time reaches the level of brilliance Amores Perros reaches, it's still a good film. In 21 Grams, Iñárritu plays with a lot of heavy moral questions but they're all pretty much up in the air. The director doesn't seem to have any particular views or statements he'd like to envision via his film, but uses the time shifting as a way to confuse the viewer into thinking he has. If the film'd been framed chronologically, everyone would see what a thin story it is and that the film really lacks heart (non-intended pun). Basically the story revolves around 3 very different people: an ex-con who seeks redemption in his faith (played by the excellent Benicio Del Torro) , a widow who recently lost her husband in a car-accident and is having trouble dealing with the loss ( portrayed by Naomi Watts)and the third person is the man who just received a hart transplant and is having trouble handling the 'second chance in life' he has received (played by Sean Penn). The main characters are brilliantly portrayed and 21 Grams is worth watching for those acting achievements alone.I gave this movie 8/10 even though it is flawed. Reason for this is that I was genuinely impressed by the performances, they felt so real that I was genuinely moved in some scenes. Something which I haven't experienced since Amores Perros, Requiem For A Dream, House Of Sand And Fog and American History X.",21 Grams
114,FilmSnobby,Saved by the actors.,5,15 May 2004,"I didn't have nearly as much of a problem with the fractured time structure of  *21 Grams*  as many of the reviewers did here.  The fractured lives on display receive a fractured point of view -- it makes sense, really.  But then, I'm used to Alain Resnais movies, which make the back-and-forth shifts of time in this film seem pedestrian by comparison.  For instance, it's pretty clear very early on that the Watts character and the Del Toro character are headed for an unpleasant rendezvous.  That only leaves one to wonder exactly how the Penn character fits into the grim melodrama, but even that detail is resolved less than halfway through the picture.  By the way, it should be noted that Hollywood actually made a romantic comedy a few years ago about a widower hooking up with a girl carrying his dead wife's transplanted heart:  can't remember the name of it, but it starred David Duchovny and Minnie Driver.  In  *21 Grams*, this plot is mirror-imaged: the heart of the widow's dead husband resides in a man, and the ensuing romance is played for tears rather than laughs.  Either way, Hollywood seems to have this weird assumption about transplanted vital organs engendering romance.  Well, what do you expect from a place  (Hollywood)  where nobody's organs are real, anyway?The movie is equally balanced with faults and virtues.  Virtues:  the acting (Del Toro, in particular, is excellent); the intensity of the pace  (every scene is important); the courageous willingness to be unremittingly bleak. Faults:  the tragic circumstances ARE perhaps piled on too thickly, almost to the point of farce; the abrogation of Ideas about faith, metaphysics, fate, et al., for a pumped-up revenge scenario that we've seen done countless times before  (the direct result of too many tragic turns to the plot; the trendy camera-work  (jittery as all-get-out)  and the even-more trendy washed-out photography.  If you can get past the faults, or indeed, if you don't see those  ""faults""  as faults in the first place, you'll view this movie more favorably than did I.  As for myself, I stopped worrying about the time-line and the plot, and instead was drawn-in by the great performances.  (The way Penn shrugs to his wife while saying, ""Time passed, I got better, and we still didn't change,""  is just perfect:  We've all been there.)  All in all, *21 Grams*  is worth the effort.  5 stars to 7 stars out of 10, depending on your tolerance for Big Drama.  I'm leaning to 6, myself.  (This is a good rating from me:  10 stars are for things like Ray's *Apu Trilogy*).  The restrained acting from Penn and Del Toro keep things from becoming too hysterical -- no small feat, given the overheated tragic plot.Worth a look.",21 Grams
115,Lupercali,Bleakest thing I've seen in a while,7,5 June 2005,"There's a reason that most stories have more or less linear narratives: because though memory is reconstructive and random-access, life as we live it is generally linear. Films that wish to explore the nature of memory and how we remember events - for instance, from the POV of the protagonist - are fine, but films that try to present events as we LIVE them, in a radically non-linear way are always going to be on thin ice.There is a balancing act. The more work you give an audience to do in terms of wrestling with structure and chronology of events, the less capacity remains to comprehend the characters. That isn't to say every film should be like a soap opera, but if you want an audience to concentrate intently on one element of a film, you will inevitably have to give up their concentration on other elements. For me, '21 Grams' goes just a little too far in this regard, and at the end there is really no pay-off. There is no real reason why these events couldn't have been portrayed in a linear way, other than to impress us with the film's non-linearity. Or, dare I suggest, to cover up the fact that if you actually piece together the plot in a linear way, it turns out to be pretty insubstantial (as well as containing a coincidence so silly, that I was telling my TV ""Please tell me that's not going to happen. That would just be too corny."") I wanted to like this film, and I came close. The acting is quite stellar. With every outing Sean Penn continues to persuade me that he is the best English language actor of his generation - or at least I can't think of someone else OTTOMH who would obviously deserve that accolade. And in this movie his performance doesn't even outshine th others. The whole cast is wonderful. But I'm sorry, call me a pleb, but this did seem a somewhat needlessly jumbled film, which ultimately doesn't reward us especially for sitting through two hours of very grim cinema. I wished the writers had backed off a little and given the actors a bit more room to shine without the distraction of trying to work out which timezone they're in at any given moment. To be honest, this kind of thing is just starting to get a little old.What would the film have been like if it had been a little more conventional in structure? I don't know. As is stands, '21 Grams' impressed me in many ways, but I can't say I really enjoyed it. Perhaps it caught me on a bad day, and I was just after something stupid. No, wait - I watched something really stupid last night; I guess it must be something else. Hmm, this really wasn't a terribly good review, was it? Well, too late now. I had to sit thorugh the movie.

While I was watching this film, I kept thinking ""If Burroughs made a bleak, depressing crime/revenge thriller, it would be something like this.""

Resembling an overlong, low-life Gap commercial, 21 Grams has mock pretensions of being another Memento-style offering but lacks that film's visual and technical panache. Constructed like a jigsaw that when complete doesn't provide a unitary image, 21 Grams touts its anti-linear narrative as revelatory and insightful. Conversely, such tactics undermine the story's context and is baffling to viewers. Not that such a device shouldn't be used - here it's just a rambling mess. As for the acting, del Toro plays his usual lowlife roles and Penn meanders through the tale like driftwood on sand. The film's supposed saving grace, Naomi Watts, is a disappointment. Having shown such promise in Mulholland Drive with a multi-faceted performance courtesy of David Lynch's masterful direction and coaching, here she does acting-by-numbers; the kind of method touted by the Academy.

If it weren't for this neat little trick keeping me rooted to my seat, I'd have left the cinema or fast-forwarded to the end (if it was a DVD).There is some *serious* acting in this film. Everyone is having a tough time and showing it by acting their socks off. I'm normally over-sensitive to sob stories, but this time I didn't need my hankie. I failed to feel much sympathy for any of the characters, despite their trials and tribulations.Yes it's a good film, but I don't think it deserves all the kudos that it's been getting in the press or the huge number of 10/10 votes on IMDb. In fact, this time-slicing technique is now becoming a bit hackneyed. Coupled with the ubiquitous hand-held camera, it's all a bit disorientating and vomit-inducing.Oh, and finally I have to add one little sexist comment. I must praise Naomi Watts for her perfectly formed - er - golden globes.

This film, thought noteworthy in its attempt to show us a novel way of telling a cinematic story, is not nearly as compelling as the players therein.   Real film fans, and I number myself amongst them, love a pretty complex story that interweaves many characters with a common bond.  It is that bit of mystery - that these same characters do not seemingly know each other - that always draws us in.  But this film is a bit fractured in an obvious ""Memento"" way and suffers from this rather than draws the same energy as the aforementioned great film did a few years back. Nonetheless we find three key characters moving towards some outcome, or more correctly towards some beginning.  The audience is properly led through a pastiche of flashbacks (seemingly), disjointed clues are strewn about and yet we are satisfactorily to find where it is going (or has been).  The audience never stirred, a good indicator of how successfully the need to see a conclusion was felt by all present.   Sean Penn is a mathematics professor as it turns out, a point I never really got from the movie.  He shows us only a moment of his expertise with theoretical math, and it could be as easily concluded he is just smart.  So revealing only a little of who a character is does not detract but doesn't add much either. What is undeniably powerful is how the pain of each character is conveyed. Physical and emotional pain - grief and illness are explored - are really brought home.  Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts both play stellar parts and should be considered in Academy voting.  And so also this film will be considered as one of this year's more avant-garde demonstrations.",21 Grams
121,travisimo,Gripping Drama,9,26 March 2004,"I've just read some user reviews, and the term ""powerful"" is used a lot. While I enjoyed this movie, was gripped to it throughout the film, and was impressed by the acting, I just didn't find it all that ""powerful."" It's an interesting story, but I wasn't moved to tears or anything like that. In my opinion, ""21 Grams"" is a solid, intriguing drama.One of the things that sticks in my mind is how director Alejandro Iñárritu had the story jumping all over the place. Now, I'm not a prude that demands all movie plots be completely linear, but I was puzzled at times on why he did jump around. What exactly was the point of going to the point of the accident where the camera is centered on the yard worker and his leaf blower?Nevertheless, Mr. Iñárritu still did a fine job. I thought Benicio Del Toro shined the most out of this very talented cast. He definitely deserved the nomination; although, I still prefer Ken Watanabe's performance in ""The Last Samurai."" Naomi Watts' performance was also stellar and maybe deserved the actual Oscar (although I haven't seen Charlize Theron in ""Monster"" yet). As for Sean Penn, he did a fine job also, but his performance was more quiet and subtle than the others.So overall, ""21 Grams"" is a fine movie and worth seeing. To me, it's not groundbreaking, but other viewers may find otherwise.My IMDb Rating: 9/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A- (Almost Perfect)",21 Grams

But it gets away with it.Once I finally got a handle on the Directors approach I really started to enjoy it.I felt for the characters and I enjoyed the different approach to the film making.The acting was great.I would recommend this but I would also warn off all those who like a black and white shoot em up action flik, this aint for you lot.

Is it over yet? Get on with it. WOW. This just got good! Naomi Watts can act! Keep it moving. Sad. Thank god it's over.All of this went through my head in that order. I had NO IDEA what this movie was about and then it all started and I wondered what the heck I was doing there but in the end, it was all worth it. An interesting story of three lives intertwined. Told by a master in a way unlike Hollywood. Take antidepressants before going. You'll need them. In the end, it all makes sense and ends on a positive note.7/10",21 Grams
125,tomrito,Very good acting by all,8,27 December 2003,"This movie has some really good acting by everyone in the cast.  I don't know if it is because of the writing or direction or if all the actors fed off each other.  The thing is, the film is very very heavy, it tells the story of a group of very tragic people and the very bad things that happen to all of them.  I know that these kind of things happen every day all over the world, but to see it put on film like this is disturbing.  I sat there numb but could not take my eyes off the actors.  The feeling was almost like watching ""Raging Bull"" for the first time, or ""Taxi Driver"".  The difference is that in this film there is no hope for anyone. It is a very sad film, a very dark film, all the people have some good qualities about them, but there is no redemption for anyone.  It reminds me of a line from the movie ""Unforgiven"", We all got it coming.",21 Grams
126,Equalizer16,A Difficult deep drama about what death really brings to the table.,9,2 December 2016,"Alejandro González Iñárritu's 2003 drama hits the heart and examines world where death has infected the lives of three people, who are all connected to each other.As part of Iñárritu's death trilogy, 21 Grams is most certainly not a barrel of laughs, but a hard hitting emotional depiction of death. Also shot in the very appropriate visual presence of Rodrigo Prieto, the film is made up of a saddening and deep expression Exploring the lives of 3 individuals: Paul Rivers (Sean Penn), Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts), and Jack Jordan ( Benicio Del Toro) who all get affecting by the same tragic car accident that brings massive change into their lives and leads them down dark depressing roads. Rivers is an ill mathematician who needs an organ transplant and struggles to maintain a healthy relationship with his wife. Peck lives a peaceful life, until her husband and children die in a terrible car accident. Jordan is an ex convict seeking salvation in the Lord Jesus, but gets sent down hill when he gets involved in a terrible ordeal.What is at the center of 21 Grams is the powerful consistent performance of the three lead cast members pulling all their weight to carry the dark tone of the film. Watts particularly shines as the struggling widower and breaks all our hearts through the soul stirring portrayal that deserved her an Oscar nomination. Del Toro also brings a very convincing character of the broken man and his desperation to be forgiven by God, which also gave him a nomination at the Academy.Bottom line is that this is not an uplifting film, but a spiritual journey into grief and what life leaves us when death enters the world. Still more is to be discovered further in Iñárritu's Babel and Amores perros. What only flaws the film is its non-linear display which I think does very little to the structure and would work just as effectively without it.Not a cheery film for a Friday night, more of your Monday Morning film, but a very sophisticated and sad piece of work. 9.2/10",21 Grams
127,aratron-00391,Excellent drama,8,5 February 2021,The movie is an experience I will not forget.

128,hoxjennifer,A Masterpiece Told in Fragments,9,9 July 2014,"I was always curious about the movie 21 grams. Trailers had made the film seem a little on the abstract side - an unclear picture of what exactly the plot would be. Similar to ""Crash"" (released a few years later) - 21 Grams tells the story of how 3 completely unrelated people find their lives intertwined by a fatal accident. The first twenty minutes of the film are told in bits and pieces - the viewer can be fairly confident that the scenes are not in chronological order, but it takes some time to figure out which pieces are the past and which are the present. The story could've have also been easily as intriguing told chronologically, but editing the pieces and putting them together in fragments keeps the viewer engaged. The segments are like pieces of a puzzle that the viewer tries to put together in order to see the big picture. And in the end, 21 grams is about loss. It's about how people change when a crucial part of their life is taken away - or given to them. It's about the impermanence of life. It's about negative and positive change, it's about contradictions, it's about old habits that die hard. With incredible performances especially from Naomi Watts, the message hits home. Truly a masterpiece - not many dramas like this out there.",21 Grams
129,winstonsmith_84,amazing film,9,15 April 2004,"Although it left me seriously depressed, i gotta say... wonderful film.  The way the film cuts back and forth is a bit jerky at first, but it doesn't matter after 30 min. into the film.  The story is gripping, real, and deals with some really harsh stuff. I don't know what to make of this brilliant film yet, but all i know is that it left me really deeply hit.  It affected me emotionally, and if a film does that well, you gotta give props to the makers of that film.  Now I've seen the other films by the same director, and visually speaking he has a very nice grainy, shaky style to his cinema.  It's grittiness suits the script's and story's grittiness.  Acting was amazing, by everyone.
Wow, a masterpiece.  10/10",21 Grams
130,alexx668,No more Mr Nice Guy,6,21 August 2007,"Problem 1 with ""21 Grams"": the plot is terribly far-fetched.Jack Jordan is an ex convict and born again Christian who's trying to raise his family. However, while returning home with his car he accidentally runs over a guy and his two daughters. Jack doesn't stop and goes back home. But later on and while full of guilt he surrenders himself to the police.Christina Peck is the middle-class housewife whose husband and two daughters were killed by Jack (though we learn that one daughter would've made it if only Jack had stopped and called an ambulance). Following the accident she donates her husband's heart for one grave-ill patient.Paul Rivers is the grave-ill patient. Close to death due to an ill heart, his wife wants to have his baby before he dies. Though it's difficult because she has sustained damage following an abortion (done when she and her husband were on the verge of breaking up). In any case, Paul gets the new heart and starts his life anew.Despite clinging to his wife while he was ill, Paul doesn't really love her. So when he hears about the abortion he finds the ideal excuse to break up with her. Instead he forges an affair with Christina (who at that point declines into alcoholism and drug abuse), despite telling her it was her dead husband's heart that saved him. In the meantime Jack abandons his family, while his beliefs in Christianity get shake-y.Upon learning about Jack's whereabouts, Paul and Christina go on finding him and intending to kill him. Paul gets a gun and faces him. But he doesn't have the heart to do it, though he advises him to leave immediately. Instead Jack returns and faces them, asking them to kill him. At that point and while Christina gets a rage attack and hits him uncontrollably, Paul (who's once again close to a heart failure) is trying to commit suicide by shooting himself. In the end they rush to a hospital trying to save him, while Jack surrenders to the police blaming himself for the whole thing. But it is not be, as the police this time finds him innocent. Finally Paul dies, while we learn that Christina is pregnant.Simply put, this kind of stuff doesn't happen.Problem 2 with ""21 Grams"": the meaning.Come to think of it, what is the meaning exactly? I'm hard pressed to come up with anything.Jack is the eternal loser and self-destructive. While a born-again Christian, he's trying to re-establish himself in society but that's not easy for an ex convict. While all too often getting violent relapses with his kids and some low-life neighborhood thugs. His weak character is emphasized when he leaves the scene after running over the guy and the two girls. But even that doesn't last, as consumed by guilt he surrenders to the police, another weakness of character. He then loses his faith, abandons his family, becomes an alcoholic, and even fails at making himself a martyr in the end.Christina is a loser also, whose life paralyzes after the tragic death of her husband and daughters, rapidly becoming a drug-addict.Paul is the scientist (a mathematician), cool headed and detached. Though this is not compatible with his agreement to follow Christina's plan to kill Jack. He also seems to have trouble combining mathematics and life, at times implying that the way things happen is miraculous. In the end and while he's dying, his meditation on life and death sounds implausible.There's not really a clear focus on what the film is trying to say.While finally we get some satisfying atheist twists, it then contradicts itself by following a perverse continuation of life (Christina's husband's dies, but that saves Paul, who then saves Christina from her depression, and eventually gives her new meaning by leaving her pregnant). So what? The film is also at times really boring, while the most interesting stuff is minor details, like the disjointed narrative, or some atmospheric takes of life in the city, or Jack's violent upbringing of his children (his young son already becoming like him). Obviously that's not enough to save the day.",21 Grams
131,levybob,"Putting a puzzle Together, and doing it Just Right",8,5 April 2017,"There are films with bad or no stories that benefit from the way that they are made; the scenes strung together out of sequence, a shaky hand held camera, a voice over narrator. Twenty One Grams is a film that benefits from a good story (no matter what other reviewers might say) and director Alejandro González Iñárritu's artfully piecing that story together. Though the scenes are, in fact, shown out of sequence, it is extremely rare that the viewer does not have some idea of what is happening, what is being forecast, and what must have happened just before this scene is shown. Naomi Watts is fantastic; when she 'loses it' out of anger and despair, you believe every word, every motion. Likewise Benecio Del Toro. Sean Penn plays against his normal roles; here he is a more quiet, introspective, instructor. If there is a weak spot in this film, perhaps it is Penn. On the other hand, perhaps not.

Rivers died Friday morning, though not due to blood loss, a hospital spokesman said.Slain UCLA Prof Recent Recipient of Heart TransplantThe Bakersfield Bee has learned that murdered mathematics professor Paul Rivers, 43, had several months ago received a heart transplant.Admitted Killer Ex-Con Jordan Released From JailThe Bakersfield police department released Jack Jordan, 38, admitted killer of UCLA Professor Paul Rivers, 43, who died this past Friday morning at St. Francis Hospital. Reporters who inquired about how a suspect with numerous arrests over a 20 year time period, who also had confessed to the hit and run killing of a L.A. man and his two daughters in October and who also was not charged in that case could be released in the death of Rivers, would only say that the physical evidence gathered at the crime scene indicated that Jordan wasn't the shooter.Jordan's Hit and Run Victims the Spouse and Children of Cristina PeckIn a dizzying turn of events the Bee has learned that the three people run over in a hit and run incident last October in the fashionable Brentwood section of L.A., were the husband and children of the woman who shared the same motel room with shooting victim Rivers.Jordan Drove the Car That Brought Rivers To St. FrancisReleased ex-con Jack Jordan was the driver of the car that brought the badly wounded Rivers to the hospital.

Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio del Toro head a stellar which includes the great actress from the French film ""My Wife is an Actress."" The Mexican director of this film proves ""Amorres Perros"" was no fluke. The film's structure is at first confusing, as was the case with ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Memento"" but it as it all comes together the results are spellbinding. This is yet another great film about America from a director from abroad, along with the likes of ""Petulia,"" ""Midnight Cowboy,"" ""Paris, Texas"" and well ""Once Upon a Time in the West."" Penn should win the Oscar this year. I never thought I'd say this, but I am rooting for him! This may not be a Frnak Capra film because of its' very dark, harrowing themes but it is a marvelous gem just the same.

134,mwendel,"A Harrowing Story of Life, Death, Rebirth, and Renewal (Possible Spoilers)",9,6 January 2004,"Filmed in an unconventional manner, with all the events out of time sequence, the amazing acted film is not for the faint of heart or weak of will.  The film details the events that occur as a terminally ill teacher (Penn), a housewife (Watts), and a reformed convict (Del Toro) cross paths because of a motor accident.  Their lives are changed forever and each of them struggles to move forward.All of these characters, as you will learn watching this film, are flawed in one way or another.  Each at the same time possess a deepness that makes you hope that the best will come to pass for each of them as they struggle against personal darkness.  The meticulous acting by the main cast brings into clear view the weaknesses and strengths inherent in each of their characters.  Their performances also don't leave you wondering if these people could be real or not - quite possibly in someone's life, somewhere at sometime, these people are or were real.  These are roles/performances that can't be described adequately enough in words.The movie's attention to each detail and frank manner will be appealing to some and appalling to others.  This movie is worthy of all the attention that it is getting and each of the actors deserves all the kudos they get for this gritty, realistic, and harrowing film.  I think anyone who watches this film can take something away from it, and learn something about themselves as these characters are as much a reflection of the society-at-large around us and the people you never meet when you walk down the street.

135,deadsenator,Wow... - 8 of 10,8,30 March 2004,"...I've just been kicked in the stomach.  This is a powerful film.  I'm a fan of Benicio del Toro already, but this role suited him like a glove and did nothing to dissuade me from appreciating his skills further.  He's come a long way from Big Top Pee-wee!  Speaking the words from a fabulous script alongside Benicio, we have stellar performances from Sean Penn and Naomi Watts.  The acting amongst them was sublime and I could go on about it, but I won't.  Not only do we have wonderful performers to enjoy, we have a fulfilling story told in a very interesting and imaginative way.  Fans of Memento will appreciate the similar style.  But it can leave you fragmented too, and that's possibly the intent.  Life can be like that, eh?  It takes the viewer on an emotional roller coaster ride, but this ride isn't very positive.  So, this coaster goes down and savagely side-to-side mostly, with some whipping of it's tail and wrapping about on itself at times.  But never really up. The word 'powerful' keeps leaping out of my head when I think about this film.  'Gripping' and 'moving' are others.  It'll make you thankful for what you've got.I had figured out some of the film, but it's quite able direction and editing had me guessing in the end.  Do NOT miss this movie.  8 of 10",21 Grams
136,reneweddan,21 Grams... 2 hours of great suspense,10,4 October 2010,"The biggest flaw of this film is also its greatest attribute... the film plays the past, the present, and the future (or one could see it as all of it as the past). This causes confusion at times, so you must be paying full attention. It caused me to want the ending to be sooner, but not in a bad way since not being concerned about the outcome would mean the film was poorly done.The acting, the script, and the execution were all great. This is worth a watch, just look at the cast list! This film focuses on the value of life, different perspectives of those involved in an incident (or the reaction from the incident), as well as the decisions that we make. It's a dark film that I'd consider to be the opposite of Crash, but just as good.If you have two hours of undisturbed time, spend it watching 21 Grams, or have the remote (or mouse for computers) ready to pause when you need a quick break, miss a second and you'll find yourself rewinding.Cheers",21 Grams
137,Manthorpe,"Great acting, confusing screenplay, and a weak story pretentious.",6,12 January 2004,"21 Grams is about three people and their obsessions including religion (Del Toro), the dead (Watts), and the living (Penn) and how they tie into each other. I loved the acting in the movie from all of the three main characters including Penn, Del Toro, and Watts, but the screenplay was intentionally confusing to hide a weak story, which makes it fairly pretentious in my eyes. Had this movie been played in sequence, I probably would have fallen asleep.Spoilers herein:When I heard the director for Amorres Perros was making a new movie with Penn and Del Toro I got really excited. While Perros was hard to watch at points, I enjoyed it quite a bit. So naturally, I expected this movie combined with the great cast to rock my socks off. Maybe I was expecting too much.The story is told in a jumbled Tarrantino sort of way, but seemingly less masterful. I believe the screenplay was written to confuse the audience as much as possible in the beginning to hide a weak story, one not to be figured out until the end. However, 45 minutes before the end I had already figured out what was going to happen and it was just a matter of when. Fairly predictable (with the exception of one utterly ridiculous event), and I think it would have been better if they had avoided that, obviously. Ironically, they did try, but in doing so, they shot themselves in the foot. So in that sense, the movie fails to deliver. Towards the end, one is simply waiting for the movie to end, which makes it easy to get bored. Not good for a movie. That combined with some of the most depressing events one can put in a movie, makes me feel that the creators missed their mark with this one. At times I kept asking myself how it could get more depressing, but it always seemed to somehow. That's not necessarily bad for a movie, but it's shoots the replay value all to hell. Much like Requiem for a Dream.great movie, but I doubt I'll ever watch it again. But unlike Requiem, I felt this movie was just trying too hard and missed it's mark.The acting is top-notch. All three main characters are excellent in this movie and is the main reason I won't rip this movie to complete shreds or give it a lower rating. I can't imagine having to play Watts' part and having to express the emotions her character was going through, but she did an excellent job and deserves recognition. Del Toro's character is simply hilarious as an ex-con holy-roller gone way too far. Penn plays basically his usual self, but it's a good character and he's very good at it.Whoever wrote the script for this movie needs to find another job or stick to B horror flicks. There were several lines in this movie that were simply unforgivable and didn't work at all. One that comes to mind is when Penn's character, who has received a heart transplant from Watts' husband, tells her, 'I've got a good heart.', while trying to get in her pants was just retarded. Actually, a lot of the bad lines in the movie come from that interaction between those two characters. Why he can't stand to not be with her baffled me and didn't work, but that's just what I thought. And his whole motivation for getting to know Watts' character is because he, 'wants to know who I am now'??!! Please, spare me. Dude, you're you, it's just a heart. I think I laughed at this part. I know he was supposed to feel guilty for getting his heart transplant from such a terrible accident but come on now, keep the love story out of it for crying out loud.And the ending, jeez. That preachy crap about 21 grams at the end was really lame and is no doubt a multiplier of why I think this movie was trying too hard and came out pretentious. I hate pretentious movies, and there's very few that I hold in that regard, but this is definitely one of them.Great acting, questionable script, weak and overwhelmingly depressing story that comes off pretentious. 6.5/10.I recommend this movie to those who would like to become clinically depressed and to those who enjoy good acting. But not for those looking for a movie to blow them away.",21 Grams
138,DVR_Brale,Troublesome lifes at most realistic,8,10 February 2017,"After Inarritu had blown me away with Birdman I had to see this one. Birdman is abstract - you can interpret it one way or the other. 21 Grams is super realistic. Nothing in this movie hides life's brutality; every detail only reinforces it. You don't have to putter with 21 Grams even though the story is told in a non-linear fashion. There are no hidden narratives or elements which may distract you from understanding the main plot. You've completely missed this movies point if you think otherwise.Acting is superb. If it wasn't, this movie would rate lower. You can almost read from protagonists faces how they reflect and respond to issues life throws at them. That's why noticing for example how Jacks home interior is designed can make you understand his mindset better.Non-linearity has a double function I believe. First is that it emphasizes how life can unfold in ways nobody could ever anticipate. Viewer can understand that better than any character in the movie because viewer sees how everybody had to respond in order to lead to the final effect. Non-linearity elevates you over protagonists and over time itself.Second is that it makes more vivid what every protagonist had to go through internally. For example: first you see a healthy character but you don't know what happened prior to this. You create a certain picture about him or her. Then you become familiar with what happened before. Put in that perspective you know how it will end but don't know what ways will a character choose. After it all plays in front of your eyes you'll probably realize that you had your prejudices which always blur our sight and ability to empathy.21 Grams is hard to watch and sometimes even scary. But it thought me two important lessons: don't be quick to judge and stay away from immediate pleasure. Hope you get a good lesson from it as well.",21 Grams
139,SILENCEikillyou,Life/death serious pulp fiction,8,30 August 2004,"This movie's format reminded a lot of pulp fiction which worked well for this story.  I think high marks go all around on this movie.  Visual, acting, direction, casting, and dramatic script.  You know, I really don't care for Sean Penn and Benecio Del Toro all that much.  Or haven't in the past.  I like Sean with less lines and Benecio with more, I guess.  They both did superbly.  Sean Penn should've earned his Oscar for THIS film and not for Mystic River.  In this one he was much more convincing and brooding. When he doesn't talk, it's almost more moving.  And Benicio was actually a likeable character and not at all overblown as I've thought of him in the past.Naomi Watts is always good.  But in this film she was really great.  Other than being a mix of many sad stories... I'd watch this film over and over again, because it's so powerful.  I recommend anyone watch this movie at least once.  Talk about a VERY different (in a good way) movie!  Where did this one come from out of all the cookie-cutter movies that keep coming down the pike.If there's ONE thing I take from this film, it's NEVER judge a person.  Not by their past, not by how they speak, and not even by their actions.  You just can't judge a person because we ALL lose ""21 Grams"" at the time of our death.

Del Toro's kids are no better, you can see ""trailer court"" and ""meth user"" written across their foreheads like it was a Twilight Zone episode. The wife of the dead guy-- prideful and wallowing in self-pity. At first, when you might forgive her for seeking revenge, she's all ""Pressing charges won't bring them back"". Months later she wants to kill Del Toro. Is this trying to say drug abuse or maybe having Sean Penn's dick inside you makes you vengeful? Sean is a real piece of work himself, the math geek who is an adulterer and user of women. What a pig. They should have used a pig's heart for the transplant, it would have taken fine. He is also a deceptive, trying to let his new girl think he had the balls to whack Del Toro but he is too much of a pussy to really pull the trigger. I read about a carpenter that lost his hand and the doctor told him they could sew it back on in an 8-hour operation but the guy had to stop smoking. And yeah, the carpenter goes back to smoking 6 months after his hand transplant, and they have to cut it off anyway. See, all the toxins in tobacco smoke kill healing tissue, that may be why Sean's transplant didn't take. And how about Del Toro? Frank Zappa said ""The only things that will screw up a kid worse than drugs and alcohol are parents and religion"". Del Toro is a typical a-grade slimebag, and rather than let us respect him for at least being man enough to steal, he pulls that Jebus act. And just when he realizes the whole Jesus thing is a con, and we think he might, just maybe, grow up like all the rest of the punk criminals do when they hit 35 years old, noooooo, he has to go on an even more massive self-absorbed drug/booze/hobo jag. From criminal to convict to Jesus Freak to hobo, yeah, that's an inspirational story ark. Sean Penn's first girlfriend is a typical co-dependent nut-case. Yeah, my old man is on the transplant list, hey lets discuss a baby, since every single second of the universe is all about me. Hey you dumb bimbo, why don't you go sue the doctor that botched your abortion and live in San Moritz for the rest of your life? You can go buy a couple African kids like Madonna and Angelina Jolie.Movies need a protagonist. I wanted to personally kill the entire cast of this mess. The plot is wildly implausible. First off, near as I can figure, not a single person in this film had a job. Think about it. The widow was going to the health club and the dope den. Just how did Sean the mathematician make his ducats? And we see Del Toro get fired and did his white-trash wife, a felony accomplice in hiding the hit and run, did she ever mention a job? Maybe if these idiots had to work for a living they would not get sucked into such wildly implausible plot scenarios. Geez-O-Pete, the widow, the middle-class soccer mom with the biggest support network and circle of friends is the one that goes off into a dope-addled murderous lusting for revenge. Del Toro, the ex-con scumbag is all turning himself in and wanting to die for his actions. Real life-- Del Toro would have stopped at the scene, maybe two blocks down. I rant about scumbags, but when you have nothing to lose it is a lot easier to stop and face the music. He was an ex-con, he knew he would skate on the thing-- he was clean and sober for crying out loud, he would not have been charged. The widow would have been remarried in about a year, to an ""associate"" of her dead husband, the only person that held a frigging job in the whole movie. That would be the first job for the rewrite team, make it be Mr. goody two-shoes that kills Del Toro's wife and kids. Upper-middle-class goody goody would definitely flee the accident. Then have Del Toro go an a carefully crafted revenge rampage. Have him bang the wife for revenge, shoot her husband and then con her into running away with him, leaving her kids to social services. I'd pay 9 bucks to see that.What about craftsmanship? All hand-held camera work, and a soap opera has better lighting, but the real crime is editing. That chopped up time-line is a sure sign of a bankrupt story teller, but I have to hand it to the director. He turned a 5th-rate revenge flick into art house fare by editing this thing with a dartboard. I am just getting damn tired of chopped up time-lines. All it does is take peoples' mind off the story and the characters. They say that voice-over is a sign of story telling bankruptcy but this hop-around crap is way worse. I read that you know when a sit-com is bankrupt when they have the amnesia episode. Well, this screwed up time-line crap is just an artsy version of the amnesia episode of a sitcom. I understand that something really dramatic has to happen in the first ten minutes of a film. OK, so pull up something dramatic and then carefully show how you are going back to a chronology. The Bible starts at Genesis and ends at Revelations. That should be a clue as to what constitutes good story telling.",21 Grams
141,Magenta_Bob,Crushing,10,15 January 2012,"How much is lost? No words could express desolation as well as Sean Penn sitting along in front of an empty swimming pool. It is about killing, dying, and coping with the death of others. How much fits into 21 grams? It also works as a symbol for its characters' fragmented lives. Alejandro González Iñárritu has made good films before and since, but to me, 21 Grams is without a doubt his magnum opus – a relentlessly bleak study of broken people, brilliantly supported by a broken narrative. Furthermore, the chronology hardly strikes me as random, since the ones that need to be in the right order to make sense, are. Sean Penn is the fatally ill man who gets obsessed by the desire of knowing who saved his life. The awkward scenes with him and his children reminds me of, but far surpasses, some of the scenes in this year's The Tree of Life. Also, they are interlaced in the least contrived way. However, mainly through del Toro's character, faith plays an important part as well.How much did 21 grams weigh?This is sometimes conveyed through dialogue, but often, words are not needed. The three different stories are probably the best and most poignant three to be featured in the films of Iñárritu, who used this kind of Short Cuts-esque style in all three of them. The best of them all is perhaps Benicio del Toro, whose character wants to do good but is always drawn back into misery. The three of them, while no model citizens, are all completely relatable and sympathetic without being presented in an overly good light. Admittedly, 21 grams might be a bit contrived on paper as well (a woman falls in love with the man who carries her dead husband's heart, really?), but perhaps the complex structure hides any potential shortcomings, because it all seems very effortless. While Iñárritu has yet to make a bad film, the center part of his death trilogy is by far the bleakest, most hard-hitting, and most rewarding.Some of the supporting characters are a bit less flattering; if I had to raise any complaints, I suppose Charlotte Gainsbourg's character, whose only goal seems to be to have a child, is a bit one-dimensional. The yellowish, ""ugly"" in a sense, visuals, and the sparse score help to create the feeling of despair and desolation. By putting the scenes out of order, the film gains intensity by somehow giving more weight to certain scenes that might have been neglected otherwise. Take, for instance, one of the early scenes where Benicio del Toro is trying to teach a young criminal the ways of god, and later finds him in the church. This film offers no less than three absolutely outstanding performances.Some have criticized the structure of 21 grams for being merely a gimmick, but I think it transcends that. Thematically, death plays a large part of course. Benicio del Toro is the relapsing criminal who finds comfort in faith, but later struggles with it and feels abandoned by god. Naomi Watts in the mother who loses her husband and two daughters and struggles with drug problems and grief.I very much doubt that it would be a superior film in the ""correct"" order – quite the contrary. How much is gained?",21 Grams
142,ks4,An amazingly deep drama that puzzles together slowly,10,25 December 2003,"This movie is at first divided into about 3 different stories, it follows each of the main characters and in the end combine them, the plot starts with Benicio Del Toro driving down Naomi Watts husband and daughters by accident, Watts husbands heart is given to Sean Penn and that's where it really starts. From here on i will reveal nothing else, you can watch it yourself, because it's so worth it!At first this movie seemed very confusing and i thought i might had made a mistake watching it, but that's generally because you have to understand that it's a puzzle that needs to be put together in your mind, from about 20 mins into the movie when i understood this i was speechless. THIS MOVIE WAS,IS,WILL ALWAYS BE AMAZING! I don't know how to describe it, it brings alive any feeling you could possibly have, it's a very deep story so if you're not into those then stay away, this is not for the people that thinks dump humour is cool, it's a very intelligent look into how it must feel to feel guilt, loss etc.. I was literally blown away, and i sat with the feeling of almost crying from 20 mins until the end.Comment on the acting i must say, Naomi Watts is amazing, really amazing, i have never seen her play this fantastic, boi she has talent, and this movie really gives proof for that, well done Watts, but also Del Toro and Penn gives a fantastic performance, the movie is really kept alive by an interesting story brought perfectly alive by amazingly acting and some beautiful pictures that is kept amazingly alive by the music.I can only recommend this, 10/10!",21 Grams
143,Aditya_Gokhale,All jumbled up for nothing!,4,19 December 2005,"I had heard a lot about this movie. I had also gotten to love Naomi Watts after her brilliant performance in Mulholland Drive. And of course, there was also Benicio Del Toro who is a terrific actor as well. So I decided to rent the DVD of ""21 Grams"".Never have I seen such a waste of great talent before! The movie tries hard to look like ""Pulp Fiction"" with the chronology all shuffled (this is not a spoiler..it becomes pretty obvious in the first two minutes). Only ""Pulp Fiction"" is a masterpiece, with some of the best dialogue, best acting, and excellent narrative that is directed brilliantly by Quentin Tarantino! ""21 Grams"" fails miserably in telling the story it has to tell or the point it is trying to make! This is also one of the sappiest tales ever in film; just that it doesn't create an impact it is supposed to create! What with the immense sorrow in Christina's (Watts) life, I just didn't feel any connection.So.... Penn gets her husband's heart, and so he feels he owes her...she weeps on knowing this fact, and they end up having sex! And Christina is supposed to be suffering and grieving a lot over her husband and daughters' death! I give this movie some credit for the brilliant performances by Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro and maybe a couple of good scenes. But that's about it! There is nothing else to write about. Sean Penn didn't seem right in this role; he was ten times better in ""Carlito's Way"" and ""Mystic River"".""21 grams"" is below average!",21 Grams
144,rsmolin,Wow!,9,31 December 2003,"Wow indeed. I've seen very few films in my life that contain such amazing character and story development, with astounding acting skills, led by Watts, Penn and Del Toro. The nonlinear approach to story-telling works well here, as slowly but surely are we sucked into a powerful and gripping plot that mesmerizes and holds our attention from beginning to end. The raw and grisly cinematography complements the story lines. I have a feeling that film students will be writing about this production for years to come. It's a gem.",21 Grams
145,Queen_of_pentacles,What exactly do we learn about Jesus Christ ?,5,21 February 2007,"The character of Jack Jordan, enacted by Del Toro, is shown trying to erase the tattoo, Jesus, with the sign of a cross, by heating a knife with the flame of a lighter ! On other occasions, he is shown singing with others, the praise of God, in the church, preparing for the mass, etc. Rev. John's character is on the louder side, almost overpowering, and some what annoying. Besides Del Toro, none of the other characters seem to have any thing to do with religion. Naomi Watts, as the woman who has lost her husband and daughters in a car accident, never prays to the Lord, for peace of mind or any thing, instead , is shown doing drugs, indulging in erotic sex with that annoying Penn, and overdoing her frustration act, a way too much ! Mary Rivers, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, is the most practical of them all ! walking out on her husband, who is more concerned with some other woman's problems, than his own wife. Since the title refers to the belief, that we lose 21 grams on death, was this movie trying to pinpoint the importance of Faith in our life, or the uselessness of it all ? Compared to his Amores Perros, the technique of scrambling the events, and then finally connecting them together, or taking off the lose ends of the threads, from where thy were left off, seems unnecessary. Perros was undoubtedly a very powerful film, with Octavio's passion for his brother's wife, those dogs fighting each other to bleed, and even die, by breaking off their necks, transition of all the characters, to a pathetic state, due to accidents, contract killing, bank robbery etc. And importantly, the steamy sex scenes between Octavio, and his sister-in-law, Remos and the salesgirl, though on the basic, rougher side, were most natural, and instinctive. Whereas, Sean Penn is absolutely miscast, and his sexual encounters with Naomi, are simply nauseating ! His guilty, thief-like side glance to Naomi, are also inexplicable. He seems totally confused, as an actor, and also as a character, why the hell is he mingling with this drug addict, howling lady ! Couldn't Inarritu find some body else ? Was he trying to show that believing in Christ is helpful, or meaningless, and just superficial ? Though much hyped, except for Del Toro's acting out a degenerating, confused ,weird character, overall, the movie does not give the feeling of having sen some thing great. Enough of those accidents mingling people together, Inarritu should think of some thing else now, and no Penn, to give us pain, please !",21 Grams
146,jmc4769,The Least You Need to Know,3,16 February 2004,"1. This is a thoroughly depressing movie. Like Mystic River and House of Sand and Fog, it starts off sad and goes down hill from there.2. The cinematography looks horrible, even worse than in 28 Days Later. All the shots are dark and dismal with a slightly blue tint. I could do better with my 10-year-old camcorder.3. There is a relatively explicit and totally gratuitous female nude scene.Naomi Watts took her clothes off in Mulholland Drive, so why not in this movie?4. The scenes are not presented in any kind of chronological order. This mixed-up editing is a gimmick more than anything. Unlike in the movie, Memento, here it doesn't serve any real purpose. Plus, it gives away the ending about half way through.5. The acting is pretty good, but that doesn't make up for rest of this mess. Bottom line – 21 Grams is one of the most over-rated movies of 2003. I give it a 3 out of 10.",21 Grams

149,med_1978,"Decent, Worthy but Ultimately Very Overrated Drama",5,21 November 2007,"I watched this film last weekend on TV. Due to the amazing reviews read on here and the extremely bad reviews from people I know, I went into this with mixed feelings. After 20 minutes of viewing I felt ready to turn it off. The movie deals with very gloomy subject matter and although it was well acted, the chronology of this film was strange in that a lot of the scenes seemed unconnected at first and appeared to be out of sequence. It was not so much the jigsaw puzzle like nature of the scenes that disturbed me but the pace and slowness of the film & the dialogue, also it had a sort of documentary feel to it. I decided to stay with it and was partially rewarded in that I witnessed some incredibly good acting from all three leads in particular Naomi Watts who was fantastic & Sean Penn was also excellent, Benicio Del Toro turned in another good performance, and the story all came together in the end. The only problem was that it was quite difficult to feel anything for the characters involved, the way the film was shot made you feel disconnected from the film and therefore it made it quite difficult to really care for the characters, probably for me Naomi Watts managed to elicit some sympathy but still the film left me with a bit of an empty feeling. So although I witnessed a decent film with a fairly good story and excellent performances, I personally would not want to sit through this film again and would not really recommend it to anyone. I can see both sides of the reviews here as it is a film that some people will like and others not.",21 Grams

I give him 5/10.If a film weighs 21 kg, for this film it is too much...But even if the history is idiot, technique (audio, image, etc.) is good. And excellent actors and actresses.In fact the history is very simple. We have a couple which does not like and whose man is in the search of a heart. A truth.We have another couple which likes and whose Marie and children will die.The heart of this man will be used for the other. There is a ex-prisoner which believe in darling and who test to be in the right way.

151,HardKnockLife210,A Small Taste of Tragedy and Beauty,9,20 December 2004,"When lives collide, often no one is around to witness the effects of the collision. Alejandro González Iñárritu, however, has captured the profound effects in 21 Grams. How much does life weigh? Iñárritu may not answer that question directly, but he does indirectly answer the question darkly and beautifully in 21 Grams.21 Grams tells the story of three lives brought together by tragedy: the life of a very sick man (Penn), a mother who has lost much (Watts), and a Christian who has recently reformed his ways (Del Toro). Really, these characters and their once-""simple"" lives are the focus of this film, and all three characters are mysterious and deep. Each of the three actors gives an excellent performance, but it is Watts who stands out in all her angst. All of them deserved Academy Award nominations, and Penn would've received one along with Watts and Del Toro if not for his incredible performance in Mystic River.Arriaga's screenplay is incredible too, leaving the outcome inexplicable enough to be real and to make sense. Santaolalla's score is odd enough to fit the dark atmosphere that pervades the film, and stick around for the credits to hear Dave Matthews' fitting conclusion. Also, Prieto's and Procopio's cinematography is gritty enough to depict the unbearable anguish of the characters.I would praise the direction as well, except that I do have one complaint regarding it. It is often so choppy and irregular that it causes the story to lose a tiny bit of its impact. Perhaps this choppiness fits the film too, but to me it was distracting.Yet you should definitely check this one out for a sorrowful picture of torment, disgust, and a strange beauty.Final Grade: A.",21 Grams
152,wereuat06-1,1 Crash Three Lives,10,10 December 2006,I found this movie very strong and making a point how death can lead to so many different aspects of life. In this movie there is Jack Jordan(Benicio Del Toro) the changed man trying to put food on the table for his family. There is Christian Peck (Naomi Watts) the drug addicted ex parent who lost her children to a deeply tragic crash. And there is Paul Rivers (Sean Penn ) the man looking for the person who gave him a heart. This leads him to Christian Peck and her husband who was hit who gave him the heart. They fall in love and look for the tragic killer of her children Jack Jordan who is changed and wants to do the rite thing and turn himself in.Paul Rivers is faced with a decision. But when confronted by Jack things turn and Rivers is wounded and looses his life along with 21 Grams. This movie is great with Tarentino proportions. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 with a great script by Alejandro González Iñárritu.,21 Grams
153,Zulfmanauthor,Remarkable journey of tragedy and redemption!!,10,18 May 2014,"After being a life long movie buff who has pretty much seen it all, its not very often you come across a real gem. '21 grams' is just that, a strange name for a film and not really connected to the story but it cleverly lures you into watching it. Once you sit down to watch it, you get a tremendous journey into the lives of three people who are connected through tragedy forever and each character has a compelling story. The film may jump from past to present and back again but that only adds to the atmosphere and intensity generated by the high calibre stars; Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro. This is a film you will feel, it's a story that reaches deep inside your soul and stays there and the characters are people you get to know, live through their eyes and shed their tears. This film is one you will never forget, that's if you understand true cinema.",21 Grams
154,kylopod,"First engrossing, then moving",9,5 November 2005,"Many movies in the modern era have experimented with fractured chronology, but most of the time this technique is used for entertainment purposes only. ""21 Grams"" is an intense and thoughtful film enriched by this technique, taken to an extreme I've never seen before. We're not talking ""Pulp Fiction"" here, where a small series of vignettes are arranged out of sequence. Every individual scene in ""21 Grams"" seems to be distributed almost at random anywhere in the film. You have to concentrate when seeing this film for the first time, because you'll have trouble figuring out what's going on, and even as a plot starts to emerge, some of the details won't be understandable until the very end. But it pays off: this isn't like ""Memento"" or ""Mulholland Drive,"" where you may need multiple viewings to understand it all. By the end of this film, the story turns out to be quite straightforward. It's like seeing a gigantic jigsaw puzzle gradually pieced together.Unlike many other films that use this sort of device, ""21 Grams"" is a character drama, not a psychological thriller. The story would still work if it were told in chronological order. Why the scenes are arranged as they are is not altogether clear, on the surface. I felt like I was watching a mystery, but after everything came together it became evident that none of the mystery was contained in the plot itself. This fact has led some critics to suggest that the scrambled scene arrangement is nothing more than a cute gimmick designed to make the film more engaging. But I believe that the device does serve a legitimate purpose, by drawing out the complexity of the characters and their situations.Life is not good for the three principal characters, and it isn't getting better. Sean Penn plays a 40-something man with a failing heart, Naomi Watts plays a young woman facing great tragedy, and Benicio Del Toro plays an ex-con consumed by guilt. Penn and Watts come off as ordinary individuals reacting as anyone might under the circumstances, but Del Toro's character is particularly fascinating. He's been rehabilitated through religion, but he's still far from perfect. As a father, he has a scary presence that makes him seem borderline abusive at times. But he has developed a powerful conscience. Is he right to hate himself for what he did? The movie never answers that question. I just appreciated that the film resisted the temptation to make him into a caricature. He is neither hero nor villain. He is simply understandable on a very basic human level, as are the other two characters.We have the feeling that Watts and Penn are wrong to condemn him as strongly as they do. They do not understand his situation, or that he's suffering just about as much as they are. On the other hand, we as viewers can perfectly understand where Watts is coming from. That's what makes the scrambled scene arrangement so effective: it never allows any one character to gain our total sympathy. By the time we've sorted out the plot threads, we've identified with all three characters on an emotional level while at the same time understanding their faults. These people are trapped in their own limited worlds, and with our omniscient viewpoint we can scarcely blame any one of them for their feelings or actions. We can see clearly what these characters cannot, which is that they are more victims of cruel fate than people who are truly guilty of anything.What is the movie's message? That people shouldn't be so quick to judge others? That could be one interpretation, but what's nice about the film is that it doesn't hammer this lesson into us. It just tells a moving and stirring tale about complex characters, and viewers can take from it what they please. The title refers to a parapsychological belief about the weight of the human soul, and it's used in this film as a metaphor for the fragility of life. If life is fragile, then it's also precious, and people need not waste their time on vengeance.",21 Grams

This film's disdain for chronological storytelling makes it all the more compelling and in fact brilliant! I know of people that saw the film who had no clue what happened but I was moved by the unorthodox screenplay and entranced throughout. Do we lose 21 grams of mass at the moment of death and is that 21 grams our soul? Does our soul continue on? I can't know, who can know, but it's intriguing to theorize and discuss. I rather like the idea that our souls do survive then inhabit some other life form (reincarnate souls is a comforting thought), but I've been knocked cold for a prolonged period of time and I can tell you from that experience the only thing I experienced was no experience at all! However I've had other experiences that convince me malevolent other world forces are at work which suggests there is other worldly good forces as well.

157,Teebs2,Outstanding Film,9,3 May 2004,"I went into this film with high hopes and wasn't disappointed. I'm not going to go into the plot, just a quick summary. To begin with the quality of the acting in this film hasn't been exaggerated. Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts are all fantastic in this film, especially the latter two. Naomi Watts in particular is proving to be one of the best younger actresses working, with her dynamic performance in this film and Lynch's Mulholland Dr. (2001).The narrative of the film is fragmented in what seems to be a random fashion, with past, present and future uncertain. However watch carefully and you will notice many of the scenes are linked either verbally, visually or thematically. My only doubt regarding such a structure is that, apart from a few ""teasing"" moments, I'm not really sure if such a structure is necessary when coupled with such a melodramatic story. It is more than a little distracting in the first quarter of the film, until you eventually learn to go with it and get involved with the individual scenes. For example, without giving any spoilers, the first few scenes are very relevant to later events, but I'd forgotten them because I was trying to unravel and reorder the narrative as it progressed. More impatient viewers be warned, this film can be frustrating and is quite demanding. The film may have failed because of this experimental structure, had it not been for the powerful cast and intense hand-held camera-work.9/10 - A very powerful film",21 Grams
158,the-evil-cult,Very Realistic,9,12 February 2004,"The emotional scenes in 21 Grams are very genuine. No soft music plays in the background. The actors don't seem to be wearing any makeup. The whole film has a documentary-like realism that contrasts against the more artificial and forced emotional scenes in great films like In America or even Schindler's List.The non-chronological timeline, although confusing at the start, is not too much of a problem near the middle of the movie when everything starts to fall together. The sense of confusion and alienation the viewer may experience is similar to the confusion and alienation the characters experience after their involvement in the car accident.Why 21 Grams didn't receive a Best Picture nomination is beyond belief. Without question 21 Grams is much, much better than the special-effects laden, commercially-driven The Return of the King and equal if not slightly better than Clint Eastwood's Mystic River.10/10",21 Grams

160,ashi-lance,21 Grams Lost as I Died,8,7 February 2013,"The title might mislead the casual non-viewer. One might be led to believe the title is in reference to drugs. In fact, it is a reference to what is purported to be the amount of weight that a person loses when they die. Fitting enough, because this movie seems to be all about death, both literal and spiritual. Snapshots of tragedy: the lives of three people--a wife and mother of two, a dying man in need of a new heart, and an ex-con turned counselor at a religious center-intersect after a tragic car accident. The film consists of episodes in their lives (before and after the accident) which are shuffled about, with scene after dramatic scene served up-one may assume-in random order; yet there's a method to this editing madness, and the film's narrative actually feels much more linear in retrospect. In masterpiece movies like Once Upon a Time in America, Reservoir Dogs, and even Memento, the scrambled story structure had a purpose, adding appropriate twists and turns for the audience. 21 Grams has that non-linear basis to it too, and sometimes it works for the audience to react. But I think there would be a lot more power to how these characters' fates and tragedies unfold if it was told linearly from start to finish. In many moments in the film I found myself knowing a little too much before a particular scene unfolded, or I found myself guessing about something that I didn't need to as one of the points of non-linear storytelling is answers first, questions later. It wasn't an aspect that made the film bad, yet the stock that writer and director put into this structure over interlocking the stories in order, or perhaps telling each story separately, is the film's only drawback. The acting by Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro, and Naomi Watts was over the top. All three put in first-class performances to tell a story that was intense from start to finish. I do recommend the movie, but I should warn you: don't expect anything light and fluffy.My Rating - 8/10",21 Grams
161,Aam_Aadmi,A film about 'extreme pain' is an extreme pain to watch,5,18 February 2006,"The story in this movie is decent in its originality however it suffers extreme damage at the hands of the film-makers due to a convulsive, non-linear format. At least two viewings are required before any of it can make sense. It may even be argued that the reason for using this method could be a weak story which is very boring if 'simply told'.Whether the director is responsible for jumbling up the script, or the editor used too many jump-cuts to suit his/her whim, its just not clear what they wanted to achieve. Past, present and future intermingle in a wacky hand-job that isn't easy on the eyes. Ultimately the non-linear / hand-held combo becomes ineffective for such a complicated plot.Aesthetics are OK. Acting and dialogs are great. Naomi Watts' character is totally miscast and she absolutely doesn't look like any 'mother of 2 kids' you've seen before. There's no explanation for the woman's body lying belly-up in the swimming pool, and few more continuity gaps. What finally happens to Charlotte's (Mary Rivers) character is not known.Nonetheless in this post-Tarantino world, where Hollywood is constantly looking for something 'new' and pretty labels are a dime a dozen, this kind of fare is an instant hit with critics who gobble it up as fresh (read: asinine, but we'll save that for your next release) and original (read: there was nothing else from Dreamworks, Miramax or Tristar).Such movies are great to watch on DVD so as to pause, rewind or forward anything that doesn't make sense at first go. Such movies also go well with 21 grams of favorite drugs, 21 ounces of favorite booze, 21 pounds of favorite food or 21 tons of favorite whatever....",21 Grams
162,showgirl626,So heart-wrenching moving in so many different directions,7,1 May 2006,"Sean Penn (as much as I hate to say it) is a brilliant actor. Naomi Watts usually annoys me, but I loved the character she portrayed in this film. And Benicio Del Toro - the poor tortured soul that he played? Wow. All incredible, and the way they were all tied together was genius, and the way it was presented even more genius. A bit hard to follow if you don't watch it from the very beginning, and I recommend that you watch it with no distractions. It is rather convoluted, but well worth it if you hold on to the end. WELL worth it.I highly recommend this film.Enjoy.",21 Grams
163,said-buet10,A piece of art,8,13 July 2017,"Without a doubt this is one of the best I've ever seen. I'm writing this after watching it for the third time...I guessThis is another great movie from Iñárritu who i think is one of the best directors of recent era. If the story is stripped down to it's basic form its simple and we've seen movies showing that before but here it is turned into an extremely good screenplay and Iñárritu transformed it into an art.The acting is so good that I often felt like I'm witnessing real emotion screaming out of the screen. Everyone in this were amazing. Sean Penn, Naomi Watts & Benicio Del Toro was great at their roles. This is the best performance of Watts in my opinion and I was shocked to see her not winning an Oscar. I haven't seen Charlize's Monster. I hope its mighty good as she came on top over this amazing performance at the Oscar. Penn and Del Toro just increased my respect for them even more with their works here.The editing,the music and the cinematography was extraordinary. The sharp change of visual and musical tone corresponding to what's being told at this nonlinear storyline was just great.I liked everything about it. This is very good and I think every movie lovers should watch it at least once in their life",21 Grams
164,Red7Eric,Sobering & Relentless,9,3 April 2004,"If you rent ""21 Grams"" (and I think you should), know that it won't make any sense at all until about 40 minutes into the film (a half hour if you're really sharp).  Don't worry about it -- just watch the scenes as they unfold, and wait for it all to crystallize.  Theatre plays have been bopping around chronologically for some time.  ""Pulp Fiction"" was the first mainstream film that I ever saw that was presented out of chronological sequence -- but ""21 Grams"" takes the practice to a whole new level.  And yet... if you give it enough time ... it all works.  It's a gritty story that gets really ugly at times.  Naomi Watts and Benecio Del Toro were nominated for Oscars for more-than-deserving performances.  Sean Penn won an Oscar in 2004 for ""Mystic River"" but probably should have won it for this movie instead.  Melissa Leo gives an expert performance as Del Toro's wife (in a perfect world, she would have been nominated as well); Charlotte Gainsbourg is slightly less effective as Penn's wife, partly because the character and her motivations are so inscrutable.  Clea DuVall (""Carnivale"") and Tony-Award winner Denis O'Hare (""Take Me Out"") have small, supporting roles.",21 Grams
165,jb0579,Worth it?? What's your attention span?,6,18 April 2011,"It should be noted, off the bat, that every actor in this movie is marvelous...like Oscar good. That's not my problem. My problem is this: too many directors think they have to get cutesy with intertwining plots, and of that's not enough, jumping back and forth in time while they intertwine the plots. To a certain degree, yes, this adds interest, but at some point you go back and forth too much and what was supposed to be a nice leisurely movie turns into an insurance seminar wherein your undivided attention is required lest you lose your place. The plot idea is phenomenal, and again the performances are as well. Even the directing is great - it's the editing and sequencing that sometimes is too much, and this movie walks the fence, teetering too close to the confusing side. Yes, the divergent plots emerge toward the end, but I within inched of pulling the plug on what, otherwise, is a gem. So....be patient, pay attention, and have the rewind button handy!!",21 Grams

167,joaocruzferreira,Underrated,9,13 June 2007,"21 Grams is, undoubtedly, Alejandro González Iñárritu's finest movie. It is also his first English language film and his second movie ever, after ""Amores Perros"".It is a complex sobering drama of survival that follows the shattered lives of three helpless individuals irresistibly brought together in one single moment of tragedy.This is arguably Sean Penn's finest performance after his Oscar-winning role in ""Mystic River"" and after portraying Sam Dawson in ""I Am Sam"". In addition, it is also Benicio Del Toro's second nomination since ""Traffic"" and Naomi Watt's strongest performance ever, which earned her her only nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role in her career so far.21 Grams is an intelligent and thought-provoking film deserving much more of the praise and nominations that have been heaped upon it. The film represents a remarkable mainstream debut for both its director and screenwriter! Unique. 10/10",21 Grams

169,LG72387,A powerful film,7,21 March 2004,"21 Grams is a powerful film with powerful performances by all three of its stars. Sean Penn is nothing short of brilliant once again as Paul, a man who only has one month to live because of his bad heart. Penn gives extraordinary depth to a character who has lost the will to live. The only way he is able to get by during the day is to have a cigarette in a bathroom. He finds life redeeming when he meets Cristina, played excellently by Oscar nominee Naomi Watts, who is a woman on the threshold as well. She has just lost her husband and two girls who were run over by Jack Jones, played by Benicio Del Toro (I'll get to him later) and she is dueling with herself over whether or not to commit suicide or just let life go on. As she tries to answer that question, she gets back in the habit of using drugs and literally doesn't know what she's going to do with herself. However, that all changes when Paul comes into her life and she is able to find comfort in the fact that he is a lost soul like herself. Now, to Benicio Del Toro, whose performance in this movie certainly rivals what we saw in Traffic. He plays a religious guru who tries to find happiness in life by leaning towards the word of God and Jesus. He believes that everything in life happens because God wants it to happen. So when he runs over Cristina's family, it was because God had wanted him to. Jack Jones is a messy character to play and Del Toro plays him perfectly enough to make us care about what happens to him. The characters are all intertwined together because Cristina asks Paul to kill Jack. What results is a climatic scene that is in itself unforgettable and totally genuine. The film itself is a tribute to another great film called Memento, which, like 21 Grams, zig-zags through the story and leaves us all dazed and confused at the end. The directors of both films depend on us to rely on our intellectual capacity to follow what is going on and it works successfully. 21 Grams ends up being a powerful film with some of the best acting I have seen in a long time and a fine script to go along with it. Lenny's Grade: A-",21 Grams
170,DennisH,Masterful editing and performances,9,28 December 2003,"Minor Spoilers:One of the most discussed features of the movie is the non-linear timeline. I've read several reviews stating both the positive and negative attributes of the technique, but as of right now, two hours after I've seen it, I have to admit the story would not be as effective if told in a linear fashion. However, I had guessed the ending long before it happened, they gave away a little too much before the climax to maintain the mystery.I think I am beginning to see a trend...any movie that has a shot of Naomi Watts' nipples is probably very good (ref Mulholland Drive). But I'm not trivializing her performance, IMO, she acts with much more talent than her contemporaries.Sean Penn gave a subdued performance that actually was more convincing than anything I've seen him in before (I haven't seen Mystic River). I usually find him talented, but I always feel like that I'm watching Sean Penn act like a stoner, retard, drug-addict...in this movie I was watching a math professor who survived a heart transplant that looked like Sean Penn .Benicio Del Toro, as usual, delivers the goods. His religious intensity, pain, as well as his mood shifts, are entirely believable.One little note about the ending monologue of the movie. A nickel weighs exactly five grams, so the comparison to four nickels instead of five would have been more precise.",21 Grams
171,LawnBoy-4,"""Powerful"" is an understatement",9,20 March 2004,"What a truly amazing film. Incredible acting, fantastic direction, brilliant screenplay - best film I've seen in the last 2 years, at least.A word of caution: This is not a ""happy"" film. It WILL depress the hell out of you - but this is a good thing. It speaks to the ability of the story, characters and subject matter to effectively move you.
The film contains some of the most powerful (as well as difficult to watch) scenes that I have seen. The scene in which Naomi Watts enters the hospital waiting room just as Penn is being wheeled out of it is so stunning and surreal that I couldn't get its magnitude out of my mind. I won't give any more specifics on that because the viewer needs to piece the story together for him/herself. It's one of those films in which the story slowly begins to make sense about 30 minutes into it.The scenes are pieced together in a non-linear format (some compare it to Memento, though I hesitate to do so because the reasons for each film's scene formatting is entirely different), which played a huge part in the film's effectiveness. As fantastic as the story is, its presentation would not have been nearly as effective in a standard, linear format.Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts give incredible performances. Penn again proves that he has no equal in Hollywood (yes, that's a strong statement, but I'll gladly stand by it) and Del Toro puts in yet another powerful, understated performance. The characters feel very real and the interconnected stories of their lives are extremely engrossing, especially given the subject matter.The ending reminded me a lot of American Beauty, though it didn't hit me as hard as the latter's final scene. However, it was a great and effective way to close a very powerful, emotional and, in some cases, disturbing (in a good way) film. This is the most moving film I've seen since American Beauty, which is saying something since I've never been as affected by a film as I have by AB.",21 Grams
172,jhmb2003,Mexican-American soap opera,4,20 April 2004,"`21 grams' is a movie about suffering and redemption, second opportunities and something that appears to be `a religious experience' without God. Seems deep and it is not. If you take a closer look, is a very stylish Mexican `Culebrón' (soap opera), with every single cliché: devastating accidents, love stories, abortions, cheating, sex and violence. You can find everything there. The `metaphysical' factor is nothing but rhetoric. But this movie is also an exercise of manipulation: You will get confused by false clues, crazy editing, flashbacks and all the paraphernalia used to dress an `adult' flick. In some moments, 21 grams reminded me another overrated movie, Memento, tour-de-force trying to demonstrate how moron you are if you do not understand the plot. However, 21 grams still manages to be powerful and entertaining. Three big issues collaborate with this unexpected conclusion: photography, performances and music, all of them top-notch. As Jorge Luis Borges said, there is not writer, even the worst, unable to write a beautiful paragraph or page. This movie has some beautiful moments. 7/10",21 Grams
173,kdavidbushnell,Intense Drama,9,17 July 2009,"If you like drama films, you should like this. I see it as a story of redemption and love. All acting performances are GREAT and genuine. Benicio probably was well deserving of the Oscar. Penn is great, easily one of my favorite Penn performances. Naomi Watts is fantastic she shines in this one, I assume it's performances like this that is getting her in good good movies lately (Eastern Promises). The movie is an awful lot about family and how you should and shouldn't treat people. REDEMPTION is the main idea I'd like to think this movie expresses. Del Toro's character is not likable in the beginning but I had a soft side for him at the end. I used to be an advocate for the death penalty-after 21 Grams, I had a change of mind because of his character. It doesn't involve the death penalty or anything like that but I believed more so than ever (after watching this) that people can change in many ways. The love stories are extremely dramatic and moving. Good movie if your ready for some deep Sh#t.",21 Grams
174,lazur-2,What's necessary?,7,24 November 2005,"Much of the disagreement on 21 Grams concerns the 'mixmaster' order of scenes. Some viewers found it to throw the viewer into the emotion right from the beginning, while others found it distracting from what would still be quite affecting as a straight-line narrative. My question is; is the non-linear scene order really needed? Perhaps another version should be available to make the comparison, but I believe that the strange scene ordering was -not- needed to fully immerse us in the mood of the story. There's another site where the reviewer states that two of the characters have had a previous affair...was it worth confusing this poor soul?",21 Grams

Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and all other casting also really good. About the story, it's very simple. Benicio killed Danny Hutson and his daughters accidentally on his birthday. Due to this Naomi become widow and lonely. In hospital Danny's heart is replaced to Sean Penn who is suffering severe heart problem and which is not suitable for him. So Danny heart is replaced to Sean. Sean has met Naomi who is suffering her loneliness and she wants to kill Benicio for killed her husband and daughters. Remaining part whether she killed Benicio.

178,Tiny T,Lame story in a defragmented time line is still lame,5,22 October 2004,"They're going to be spoilers here. I don't know what's got in to the director but I have never seen so much crap in my live. The whole story: writer has heart condition and waits for a heart transplant. Somebody got killed in a car accident and the wife gives the heart up for transplantation. She asks if she might know who gets it. Off course not. The writer gets the heart who he doesn't deserve because irresponsible behaviour (putting his live more at risk by smoking while waiting on a new heart). After getting the heart he wants to know whom it's from. Again, privacy prevents getting that information so he sends a PI on a chase. Now the guy who was responsible for the accident fled the seen but gave himself up the day after. Although the wife had doubts for prosecuting the guy all of a sudden wants to punish the guy after he is released from prison (a bit strange). The writer start getting in touch with the wife after he found out where the heart came from. Even after telling the wife that he has the heart she still wants to have contact with him and ask him to kill the guy from the accident. He fakes the kill and the accident guy decides to go back to the writer to be killed after all (how can you believe that). Off course the guy was already a rehabilitated criminal and not a normal person so its normal to have such stupid wishes specially when he believes strongly in the lord. So off course these very strange moments the writer decides to shoot himself as a solution to everything and maybe a little bit because the transplant seems to be unsuccessful and he needs a new heart. So in short: guy kills father and 2 kids in car accident. The heart of the father is given up for transplant. Other guy gets heart and gets into contact with widow of father. After a while they decide to kill the guy from the accident but it didn't work out so the with the new heart decides to kill himself leaving the wife again behind grieving. We forget that there might be a different guy why appreciates the new heart and count its blessings when he gets it and goes on with his life. So all and all a very thin story try to made interesting by using memento techniques. Very cheap if you ask me.",21 Grams

I can totally see why they might like it.The Good: All the performances were good to excellent. Naomi Watts in particular.  The Cinematography was very effective and the sound track and audio also very good.The OK. The premise of the story was ok. Had nothing to do with the 21 grams. I know they try to make you think it does but they only do it by tying to get you to believe the story has something to do with the weight loss that occurs at death. You could have watched ""Cinderella"" and said the same thing to get some people thinking ""woah dude, that was deep"".  Not very thought provoking or profound for most adults though.The Bad. The Editing and direction.  Why they decided to try the ""Memento"" thing and go back in time, I have no idea. It was borderline insulting and aggravating. There was absolutely no rhyme or reason for having it in the film other than to make it more artsy. In Memento, it was brilliant. Now all these film makers who didn't get the reason why it was a necessity in Memento, try to use it to enhance a bad story. It does a great job of taking you to the wrong conclusions early on but the trick to a good movie would be to lead you to a great ending.  This ending was not only drawn out, but a complete let down.",21 Grams
180,charlesem,Unenlightening,6,11 March 2017,"An egg is an egg no matter how you scramble it. You can whip it into a meringue or a soufflé or an omelet, but it still retains its eggness. The same thing, I think, is true of melodrama: There's no disguising its improbabilities and coincidences, its short cuts around motive and characterization, its intent to surprise and shock. Mind you, I don't have anything against melodrama. Some of my favorite films are melodramas, just as some of our greatest plays, even some of Shakespeare's tragedies, are grounded on melodrama. It's just that you have to approach it without pretension, which is, I think, the chief failing of Alejandro González Iñárritu's 21 Grams. The melodramatic premise is this: The recipient of a heart transplant falls in love with the donor's widow, who then persuades him to try to kill the man who killed her husband. It's the stuff of which film noir was made, but Iñárritu takes screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga's premise and scrambles it, using non-linear narrative devices -- flashbacks and flashforwards -- and casting an unrelievedly dark tone over it, as well as reinforcing a pseudoscientific message in the title, which is explicated at the end of the film. In 1907, a Massachusetts physician named Duncan MacDougall tried to weigh the human soul: He devised a sort of death-bed scales, which would register any loss of weight at the moment a patient died, thereby demonstrating to his satisfaction -- if not to the medical and scientific communities -- that the weight of the soul was approximately three-quarters of an ounce, or 21 grams. I suspect that Arriaga and Iñárritu meant the allusion to this bit of nonsense metaphorically, but it doesn't come off that way. By the end of the film, we are so weighed down with the misery of its protagonists that it feels like sheer bathos. This is not to say that 21 Grams is a total loss as a film. Iñarritu is one of our most celebrated contemporary directors, with back-to-back Oscars for Birdman (2014) and The Revenant (2015) to prove it. I just don't think he's found himself yet, but has become too caught up in narrative gimmicks that prevent him from delivering a completely satisfying film. There is much in 21 Grams to admire: The performances of Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, Benicio Del Toro, and Melissa Leo are as fine as their reputations suggest they would be. The narrative tricks are done with great skill, especially with the aid of cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, who uses color to make each of the narrative segments distinct from the others, so that when the film cuts from one to another, the viewer feels better oriented. And there's no denying the emotional impact of the film as a whole. It could hardly be otherwise, given the pain suffered by the protagonists: Cristina (Watts), who lost her husband and her two little girls; Jack (Del Toro), the ex-con who accidentally killed them and believes that it was all because Jesus wanted it to happen; and Paul (Penn), who finds his chance at a new life marred by knowledge that it was at the expense of other people's happiness. But in the end, all of this suffering is off-loaded onto us without any compensatory feeling of having been enlightened by it. (charlesmatthews.blogspot.com)",21 Grams

Well, I could at least have saved time by walking out after the first 30 minutes. Sure the performances are OK to good, (but not outstanding) and who cares anyway? I felt nothing for any characters in the film, and the confusing jumps between scenes and forwards and backward in time are irritating and pretentious.

I say you'll lose 2 hours of your life and thank god you've got more optimism in your makeup than the messages drilled home here. This may just be the most cloying, overbearing, and pessimistic film ever made.***Spoilers ahead***The film is jam-packed and brimming with over 2 hours of tragedy, misery, and generally depressing themes. There isn't a single solitary moment of optimism or happiness shown in this film except for what you might speculate or conjure in your own mind after the film decides to end and leave you guessing what might happen in the future for these people. Murder? Got it covered. Suicide? Yep. How about drug addiction, slow death from illness, the denouncement of one's faith, or abortion? It's all here! It's as if the film maker went down a checklist of all the darkest themes he could think of to stuff into this film. Granted, I wasn't looking for a sweet hollywood ending, but come on! What's the ultimate message here? Certainly not perseverance or how the human spirit rises above adversity and life changing tragedy, because nobody really does in this film. In the end, the film poses the questions: when we die, what do we gain, what do we lose, yet by all accounts it makes no attempt to answer these questions thoughtfully other than what it's shown you for 2 hours prior: a very one sided, depressing view of little hope with seemingly no redemption or light at the end of the tunnel.Granted, the film is not without it's merits. The acting is superb, the non-linear telling of the story out of sequence is interesting (though no longer a unique style of film making and done much better in films like Memento), and the grainy, drab, washed out shooting style gives the film an interesting look and helps maintain the consistent theme of dread. Hell, it even managed to keep me engaged 3/4 way through before I decided that it was unbearable and painfully apparent that the film was prepared to give up on itself (similar to how main characters chose to give up on their lives). And that's really the problem I have with the film. It's downright fatalistic! Overall, a stylish yet shallow, one-dimensional, downer of a film.",21 Grams

Unlike some others I do not think the unchronological storytelling hurts the movie, on the contrary I think that the pieces that the viewer has to put together in order to get the picture of the whole story just make it more interesting. On the other hand, no matter how good the movie actually is it is one step short of masterpiece. It is like you are climbing to heaven but you cannot make it over the last step. The story is good, the filming is good, the acting is good, but there is still SOMETHING missing for this movie to be added to my hall of all time faves. Maybe it is the music, this film does not have a strong score, maybe all the components do not add up well together...

187,enicholson,Funky arthouse melodrama weakened by one-note characters...,5,25 November 2003,"21 GRAMS is the most disappointing film I have seen in a while.  It has a very crafty and engaging, layered narrative style and it has a pretty interesting story -- but there is something about this film that struck me as arthouse cliche while at other times contrived melodrama.  Mainly, though the acting is quite good (especially Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts), the characters are not interesting.  They are flat, with few fleshed out human traits, and they never say anything real or interesting.  Instead they mostly quote scripture, cry, moan, shout, scream, complain, shrug, etc. They are there to quiver and cry and exist to hang the story on rather to live and breathe and seem real.SOME SPOILERS FOLLOWFor example, Paul's (Sean Penn) courtship of Christina (Naomi Watts) is not only creepy and boring, but it feels contrived and hollow.  Why does he wait so long to tell her that he is carrying her deceased husband's heart? What is the point of him following her around like some weird stalker?  When he does reveal to her that he is carrying her husband's heart, it feels staged and false because the timing feels too on the money.  His revelation feels like maximum melodrama -- an actor speaking to another actor.  It's all there for effect.As far as credibility factor is concerned: related to Paul's courtship of Christina, I found it somewhat hard to believe -- or at least a bit repulsive -- that Christina -- presumably a good, considerate person -- would insist on driving home from a bar completely stoned and drunk not long after her family got creamed by a hit and run driver.  What's the point of making her character suddenly so unstable when after this scene she's never really so unstable or self-destructive at all again in the film?  Again, Paul offering to drive her home just felt like a contrivance for the story -- yet he inexplicably keeps delaying telling her who he is.  The cloying melodrama thickens.  You can feel the whole project turning in to a soap opera despite the cool camerawork and layered storytelling.Moreover, the scene where the doctor accidentally reveals to Paul that Mary (his girlfriend) once had an abortion is also unconvincing.  If the scene is supposed to make us see the lack of a real, trusting relationship between Paul and Mary, it doesn't work.  Instead it simply makes Paul seem like a phony -- a huge jerk; and the scene is just a writer's idea to make their relationship unworkable and on the skids.  This whole scene feels like a device to get two characters in a movie script to break up -- rather than two real people to break up.  If there is any deception here it's not the abortion in Mary's past but instead it's that we are lead to think Paul is an interesting, provocative person simply because he is a college professor with a bad heart who has a hard time quitting smoking.  For such a supposedly smart, fascinating guy, he never says or does anything smart or fascinating.  He simply walks around looking cool -- looking like Sean Penn. The one time he does sort of sound like a smart person with some personality is when he is having lunch with Christina and he starts muttering something vague and perfunctory about Fractals.  But even then he just seems like he is trying too hard.  Only Naomi Watts' great acting ability rescues the scene from embarrassment.In fact, just about everything about all the characters in this film feel generic and perfunctory (somewhat more generous terms than ""cliched"" I suppose): the American working class characters are conservative, religious, drive pick-ups and wear shirts with American flag decals on them.  The educated, upper middle class characters dine and chat like they are in a wine commercial.  These characters exist to define their class and background and to act as vehicles for the story -- but they have hardly any identity beyond that.  If Sean Penn seems interesting it's because he is Sean Penn and has the coolest hair in the history of movies, but he isn't believable in this role as a bedridden academic nor is he believable as selfish prick (at least not here).Benicio Del Toro's character, Jack, feels the most real of all the characters in this film.  But even he feels like some kind of representation or ""type"" -- another angry bad man turned religious good man.  However, even though he feels typical in many ways, at least he is mostly sympathetic and somewhat fascinating.  But his sidekick, the community preacher always shows up at next to him like some shrill guardian angel/evangelical golf caddy. Doesn't this guy ever have any quiet moments?  Doesn't he have a life of his own?  The way he forces himself on Jack is the way this film tries to force itself on to us, the hipster moviegoing audience.  A lot of forceful attitude, but little personality.  It all feels like acting, not living or being.One last thought: haven't there been a number of films recently involving heart transplant patients and the relatives of the organ donor?  It seems like it.  I guess it's a great melodramatic premise with great thematic and emotional potential.  But soon enough the melodramatic elements in this film began to feel routine.  It's revealed someone has had an abortion, then later someone else is pregnant after such and such person, the father, just died.  All of this without a hint of irony.  I have to admire the director's strong sense of sincerity in this wound down age of cheap, cynical irony, but here the melodrama feels like a oft-repeated Catholic morality play emptied out in to the streets of white and blue collar America.  A killer video style of editing and narrative layering provides a cool way to relate a decent melodrama, but the limp characters wallow and drown in all of these layers of crying, remonstrations, revenge plots and noisy pity for little reason other than exaggerated effect.",21 Grams
188,sl-pierce,Mind-blowing!,10,11 May 2011,"21 Grams is a tremendous feat, an emotive film that explores the depths of life and death and everything in between. Sean Penn, Benicio del Toro, and Naomi Watts give outstanding performances and truly reveal the measures we are willing to take in the name of love, revenge, forgiveness, and death. The way Alejandro González Iñárritu connects the lives of these three characters is mind-blowing, as he challenges the viewer to piece together the narrative as the film continuously flashes from the past to the future to the present. Although I found this fragmented style confusing at first, it slowly begins to unravel and make sense, and I believe it is the only way these tragic stories can effectively and artistically be told. The characters in the film, and in turn the viewer, wrestle with a deep variety of emotions and issues that have the potential to change their lives forever. At least it certainly had a profound impact on myself.",21 Grams

All the cheers are for the director from the off-scene crews, he has so meticulously designed the movie into a classic one. He has also worked quite hard for each and every scene and everything that is shown in the movie is intentional and planned. I think he has done quite a many retakes to make the movie so much ecstatic.Background scores and sounds are good eg. Penn's breath sound is too good.Sean Penn as always has done a beautiful job but the scope for acting is even better for Naomi Watts and she has proved her excellence in acting.

Perhaps it is because they all deal with such shattered characters - in this case we are given a man who has just undergone heart replacement surgery which temporarily alleviates the strain between him and his separated wife, a born-again man who suddenly finds himself responsible for running over and killing a husband and two girls and the woman who has lost her whole family in that car accident. Each of these characters are faced with the idea of moving on with their lives; as we watch them adjust, we see that the difficulty isn't overcoming the past - it's the realization that they don't even understand what their lives are anymore. The serious performances from the three leads (Sean Penn, Benicio del Toro and Naomi Watts) are really what give the film its depth, and even make up for Inarritu's completely unnecessary nonlinear style, which seems to serve no purpose other than to make the viewer pay more attention.",21 Grams

The film doesn't have the integrity of films such as ""Before the Rain"" or ""Memento"" although it tries hard and certainly has some value. I am surprised at the intense reactions some people have to this film as though it's earthshakingly new in concept.

196,Elori,21 grams makes me want to die,2,2 September 2006,"Despite my instincts telling me otherwise, I took to watching 21 grams at the recommendation of a few misguided friends. The movie is supposed to root in the myth of the human soul weighing 21 grams, the weight that a human body loses at death. It is indeed a myth, without any scientific proof behind it. It is unfortunate, then, that this movie manages to add nothing to that myth nor use in any significant way. It is just a cheap trick to try to make this movie appear a little more high-flying than it actually is.The subject matter of the movie is supposed to be death and fatality, but the handling is very superficial and banal. What's more unfortunate is the pervasive religious theme brought in through one of the main characters, played by Benicio del Toro. The sickening religious propaganda spouted in his scenes would be pleasant hearing only for the most enthusiastic Christian zealots.This movie is neither enlightening or enlivening, and it offers zero insights into the themes it handles. The plot line is held together by thin threads, and noticing this, director Iñárritu has jumbled the chronology of the movie to try and give the viewer a little less obvious understanding of the story, but with such thin material, the method is put to waste. ""21 grams"" is an overrated movie, and only those in desperate boredom and need to kill time might find any value in it. The film is pretentious yet banal, a run of the mill story that gets lost in the mire of thousands of movies without anything to say.",21 Grams
197,crooked_spoons,"A Choppy, Disjointed, Tangled Mess.",5,4 February 2010,"21 Grams should've been good. It follows that 'gritty' vignette-type formula that has worked so well in the past. It has all the elements of a good story, especially the type of story so many intellectual types are into these days. The eclectic music, the slam against religion, long silences etc. Sadly, it falls short in just about every way imaginable.Nonlinear story telling only works if there's an actual story to tell. Sadly, aside from some shouting, quite a few tears and forlorn glances this movie had absolutely nothing to say. The acting was neither bad nor good, or maybe the characters we just so unlikeable that I didn't bother to really examine their ability. Del Toro gave a pretty good performance though, however his actions/past was never really explained so I couldn't really tell if, at times, he was overacting, underacting or spot on. And there was quite a good deal of mumbling or jumbled lines that forced me to rewind, and even after several viewings, some of the dialogue was utterly lost on me.Things that maybe would've shocked you are given away early on, thus leaving no element of surprise or feeling of epiphany in the end. The wheezing man walking through the desert...you already know what's going to happen, and you can pretty much guess why. The crying woman...again, no surprise.21 Grams seems to at one point actually HAD a point, but in the end, it loses steam and eventually sputtered out into a disjointed mesh of nonsense.",21 Grams
198,Devans00,Tedious and Predictable,3,13 December 2003,"Even though this movie was tedious (I could swear I was in the theatre 3 years) and predictable there were a couple of shining lights.    Melissa Leo as Marianne Jordan was the biggest stand out of the film.  Whenever she came on screen it would just grab my attention (and wake me up). I've known ""Marianne Jordans"" in my life. Melissa gave so much depth to the character that her   And I'm not just saying that because I loved her Sgt. Kay Howard on the Homicide series.The other character I loved and perked up when he came on screen was Eddie Marsan playing Reverand John.  It was criminal that they didn't use him more and give him more screen time.  It would have been easy to play Reverand John as a stereotypical benevolent outsider paying for his sins by running a church in a tough neighborhood.  Instead you got the impression that Reverand John went through the same trials and tribulations as his flock. He was one of them instead of above them.Even by the end of the movie when all the strings tied up, I didn't give a fig about any of the main characters (Christine, Paul, Jack), their motivations or what would happen to them.  They were unappealing and without depth.  The hyper-realistic photography didn't help.  I felt like I was watching the movie through a 3x magnifying mirror without enough light. Benicio Del Toro drew me in to watch the movie, but he wasn't the best thing in it.",21 Grams
199,tetractys,Amores Bathos!,3,22 April 2007,"A mediocre story dressed up with non-linearity, fragmented cinematography and extreme close-up faux-intimacy. A thoroughly humorless presentation, this has all the hallmarks of a student film, like some of Robert Rodriguez's poorer presentations.There are at least three scenes that were so poorly acted, directed and edited that it was embarrassing to view them. Sean Penn tries to pick up Naomi Watts by telling her that ""eating alone causes kidney damage."" This line is so lame that when she brushes him off, we wonder why she doesn't sneer. When he shows up again, saying he's ""still worried about those kidneys,"" we wonder why she doesn't call the police. When she discovers he has her dead husband's heart, she frantically tries to kick him out of her foyer, screaming, ""You make me sick!"" but it doesn't project, so she says it again. As Penn leads Benicio del Toro at gunpoint to the supposed place of his execution, he overacts his unfamiliarity with a weapon and thuggery with such ineptitude that he would have failed Beverly Hills High acting class.As the hapless hangdog stalker Penn shows up time after time in Watts' life, she ignores him, as she should. But suddenly she calls him on his cell phone in the middle of the night, telling him, ""I need your company!"" or some such rubbish. Say what? They have had zero meaningful interaction, he appears to be a wacko, and now she wants to wash his tonsils? The drug-taking for Watts is totally unmotivated. It's just a thing she does. The images that are motivated -- Del Toro's abusive behavior and Watts' breakdown upon learning of the death of her family -- are very unpleasant to witness. That is the main problem with this film. We are watching unpleasant people do unpleasant things. Watts' hysteria is well-acted and appropriate, but do we really want to see what happens to a wife and mother in a hospital waiting room when she hears her husband and children are dead? I don't. Her reaction -- to become emotionally isolated and deadened, to take drugs, and to sleep with Sean Penn -- are not enjoyable -- or edifying -- either.At the end, I couldn't care less about any of these people. They can do what they do, but I don't want to see it.The audience knows within a few minutes the outline of the jigsaw puzzle which will be filled in by the director. It is not a 500-piece puzzle. It is a child's 16-piece puzzle. But Inarritu cuts each of the sixteen big pieces, large to fit a child's small hand, into smaller pieces to give the appearance of complexity to please a supposedly adult audience. Instead, the result is a movie that is 45 minutes too long, pretentious in its inability to stop dwelling on points made an hour previously, and painfully unable to subtly imply the intimate pain the characters are suffering, instead insisting on shoveling bushels of pathos at the viewers, like gallons of hot sand.This movie should be titled Amores Bathos. I ended up turning to my companion and making comments. When Naomi Watts tells Sean Penn, ""I am afraid ..."" I said, ""... this movie will never end."" When he kisses her for the first time, I made sucky noises on the back of my hand. Finally, we both left to breathe free air. Neither of us cared how it ended. We knew. The corner and side pieces had all been put in place, along with the fragments of the final piece that Inarritu dangled repeatedly in front of us. But we didn't allow him to mess with our heads. We walked out on his movie instead.This film is a disappointment in the career of the director. Amores Perros was a wonderful departure from the nonlinear action films prevalent at the time it was released in 2001. But Inarritu uses the same technique here, and it fails. I was reminded of the Saturday Night Live Mexican soap opera parody where the characters ask for ketchup at the dinner table. The camera zooms in on their nose hairs while their nostrils twitch with extreme emotion. ""The ... ketchup!?"" Or the FedEx commercial where all the actors are doomed if they don't get the shipment off on time.It makes me fear a promising director is either a one-trick pony or has fallen for the Hollywood reward syndrome. ""You did that real good and it made money. Go do it again with stars in the cast. Here's a wad of cash."" Oh, and don't even ask about the accordion music.",21 Grams

In ""21 Grams"" three different story lines are woven together and joined by a freak accident. At first watching the film is a bit frustrating because the you are very confused by the various characters and plot lines, but once it clicks you feel accomplished, like you solved some sort of puzzle. Then it becomes a guessing game of what is coming next and how all the pieces of the puzzle will fit together.The characters of the film struggle through the big questions about love and life and how we are all connected.

At times it was hard to follow the fragmented storyline with all of the jumps forward and backward in time and the ending was expected but unsatisfying. It is an intense film with many unexpected twists and turns; there was also a lot of violence and nudity, some of which could have been omitted without detracting from the film. The name 21 Grams seemed to be unrelated to the film even after its meaning was explained but that had no bearing on the actual movie. 21 grams was good but I preferred Biutiful and Amorres Perros over this movie by far.",21 Grams
202,Axel-9,"Great performances, nice cinematography, but what happens?",6,21 November 2004,"21 Grams is a hard film to like. The first half hour or so is inaccessible and at points the editing leaves one bewildered. You don't get a chance to know or engage with the characters because you are buffeted between stories at an incredibly fast pace. I'm just about to learn about Jack Jordan's faith then I'm suddenly thrown into Paul Rivers's marital strife. At times this works well, like the cut from Jordan giving his son a slap, into Cristina Peck's kitchen where she is baking a cake with her kids. There is a certain fluidity to it that makes sense, aside from the fact that those events are actually taking place in the same time frame.Ah the time frames. As I said at times the cutting between them is quite bewildering, but then I stopped to think what the movie would be like without them, as in the editing cleverly disguises what it really is. Yes it could have been a feature length episode of British hospital drama Casualty, with superior acting. Seriously, we've got the family of to meet mummy, the guy who's just been sacked and the guy who needs a heart transplant, what catastrophe will it take to get them all in the ER room? And that in my mind is where it all falls down, this is just a bit of melodrama, that is technically brilliant, contains powerful performances, but is at best a very dull story.That's not to say I disliked it. The pay off at the end is very good, and seems to provide a philosophical twist to events, and gives Rivers a noble slant to his character's arc. Sean Penn IMO gives the stand out performance, measured, calm, at times enigmatic and never showy. He makes Rivers feel genuine. I believe in him when he 'stalks' the wife of his heart donor. Del Toro's Jordan is very good, he conveys the genuine anguish of his character, as he falls from the born again Christian he has fought to become. Watts as Cristina I felt was the weak link. There are moments where she gets angry, that I felt were incredibly contrived. For example when Paul first hits her with his revelation, her explosion felt stagey. I've seen angry, I've been angry, and know what it should be like. Melissa Leo as Jordan's wife is very good in the scenes she gets, but again it's a character conveying anguish. There's a lot of that in this film.The director says it's a hopeful film, and I'd agree to an extent. The ending offers some hope for the characters, as they resume their lives. I don't think life is as simple as that though, they've seen and lived some pretty bad sh*t and I imagine they'd be scarred no matter how they approach the future. I did like some of the symbolism Inarittu finds with some of the cuts. For instance there's a shot of Jordan leaving his truck, and as the camera lingers it captures in the frame a number of religious symbols in his car. Then when Cristina leaves her kids' room after she gets the call, the camera focuses on a mobile hanging. In each case it lingers for a second or so, giving one the chance for some reflective thought.Overall it's an interesting film, it will make you think, but whether it will really engage your emotions I don't know. Certainly didn't engage mine and left me pretty cold. It's hard to find specific things to criticise it on, I suppose if I was struggling to say why I liked something I'd say it was the 'je n'ai ce quoi' so this is reverse 'je n'ai ce quoi' if you like. That and the fact that it's a glorified version of a bit of British kitchen sink drama!",21 Grams
203,rosepol,No awards deserved,6,31 January 2004,"Critics, actors, and film fans may love this move, but viewers in touch with the real world do not. The movie is superficial in every respect and technically excellent in most aspects. As usual, the actors and fans are drawn to a plot and characters they believe to be realistic and dramatic, a delusion easy to sustain if your point of reference is Fargo, Tarantino, and Michael Douglas. The characters are not believable and we care nothing about them. They lack coherence and individuality. The college professor has no personal characteristic or outlook that could be grounded in a life of research and teaching -- how many college professors are still completely addicted to cigarettes? The happy housewife who is an ex-addict has no connection between what led to her addiction and what led to her domestic bliss. The ex-con who got religion has a problem with impulse control but that has no connection to his angst or faith. The film merely juxtaposes different qualities within a single individual, but real people blend opposites in complex and individualized ways. This movie just combines stereotypes. Moreover, the lack of a coherent story line or sequence is an attempt to hide the incoherence; it provides an intellectual hook but not an emotional one.The film's message is both trite and somewhat odd. Delusions (religion, drugs, cigarettes) provide temporary pleasure but are no basis for lasting happiness, which stems from human relationships. However, most relationship are unsatisfactory because of faults in individuals, faults that can only be corrected fictionally in the rushed ending to an entertainment.",21 Grams

205,jasonsurety,A Reminder,7,7 June 2004,"21 Grams is an excellent film.  Marked by raw, emotional performances, a caliginous atmosphere, and a dissevered timeline, this is one of the best films I've seen for some time.  Director Alejandro Inarritu is certainly a talented filmmaker with style galore.  Many have questioned the relevance of telling this story in a non-chronological order.  Others have said it adds value to the narrative by forcing us to pay attention, thus helping character development.  I have to agree more with the latter.  This film would have been moving told in a traditional fashion, but placing the events in a strange pattern heightens emotion in certain scenes.  We see something happening that we don't understand, then we are taken back to an earlier time, then we're told more about that earlier event in the film that actually happened later in the lives of the characters.  We sometimes know what is going to happen, we sometimes do not know what happened.  It sounds confusing, but it isn't that bad.  By the end, we know everything important and even tidbits that are quite endearing.
Each of the headlining actors are incredibly passionate in this film.  Namoi Watts especially does a wonderful job exemplifying pain and anguish.  Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro each do outstanding work as well.  The supporting cast is also top notch with Charlotte Gainsbourg playing Del Toro's troubled wife who struggles to hold her family together, and Clea DuVall does great as a friend to Watts.  
The story revolves around Penn, Del Toro and Watts.  It is fairly easy to start to see how they are interconnecting.  This is another reason why I think Inarritu decided to use a skewed order.  The story is fairly simple and relies on coincidences for much of its interest.  The disorder adds interest.  I was reminded of Magnolia, a movie that seemed to be about coincidences but was ultimately about forgiveness.  21 grams ends up being a movie about redemption, although it really drags you around to get there.  I would rather not reveal any specific plot details, because a little information can go a long way in a film like this.
This was a reminder to me about the influence Christopher Nolan's Memento has had on movies.  Since that film there have been many attempts to use a disjointed sequence of events to add value to a film.  While this film does not measure up to Nolan's masterpiece, it was a brave attempt.  More people are taking from Nolan than any filmmaker since Tarantino released Pulp Fiction, and you'd have to say Nolan was probably influenced a bit from Quentin, too.  Memento stands as a landmark and will only grow from here.",21 Grams
206,shinymc_shine,21 GRAMS OF FAT,7,26 May 2004,"""21 Grams"" is a puzzle of a film. Your brain works overtime trying to piece disjointed scenes together in your mind. It's difficult to judge a film that infuriates it's audience for no reason other than drawing attention to it's director. If you enjoy brainteasers and jigsaws, then this film's for you. Others beware.A mathematician (Sean Penn) is given a second chance of life due to a heart transplant. The heart's from a father of two who, with his girls, were the victims of a hit and run. An out of work, convicted felon (Benicio Del Toro), who has found comfort in the lord Jesus Christ while incarcerated, is the driver. When Penn hires a private investigator for information on the donor, he begins to spy on the widow (Naomi Watts) who can no longer cope with her loss. The two strike up a friendship and soon they turn their attention to the man that brought them together (Del Toro).This confusing film is extremely complex in it's narrative. It jumps around with no rhyme or reason. There are other films with non-linear story lines, eg. Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"", but they have specific, obvious reasons why they're told in that fashion. I can find no justification in it's order of scenes.Due to its complexity, the film begins to drag, the audience becomes uncomfortable and we feel that by the film's conclusion that maybe there'll be some little nugget that'll explain its unorthodox storytelling. But there isn't. You have to ask yourself whether the screenplay was written exactly as it is on screen or whether it was the director's choice in post-production.One explanation that does come to mind is that this dramatic tragedy, due to its complex narrative, becomes a mystery. Within the first quarter of an hour, Penn's walking and talking with no difficulty, in another scene he's breathing with the aid of an oxygen tank and, somehow, in yet another scene he's a near vegetable lying in a hospital bed hooked up to several life support systems. You begin to ask yourself, how does Penn get into these situations? It creates a sense of mystery that wouldn't be there if it wasn't edited in this fashion.Ultimately, this is a simplistic story. I'm reminded of the Oscar nominated ""In The Bedroom"", another overrated, overlong film with an extremely ordinary tale. This is an actor's piece, similar to a kitchen sink drama. Why the director would draw attention to himself and not his actors shows that he's more interested in the auteur theory than his oeuvre.""21 Grams"" is gritty in it's production design. Del Toro lives in a cluttered, lower class, suburban home which is more realistic than most American settings. The jail sequence is sickening and it genuinely disgusts you that people can be imprisoned in such squalor. Production designer Brigitte Broch should be commended for this darker more realistic look at America. It also helps to have a non-American director, as foreigners have a fresh and non-patriotic eye which helps capture the reality of their chosen setting.Another thing that stands out is it's view of religion. Del Toro's character's a little freaky in his total faith in the Bible. He can recite passages verbatim and truly believes that his life is in God's hands. But the film also shows how the Bible can be misinterpreted, leading to a biblical showdown between Del Toro and his local priest.It's difficult to judge an actor's performance when the film's told in a non-linear way. Most people know that a film is shot out of sequence because of locations, availability or weather. So it's an achievement for an actor to give a measured performance even though their work schedule doesn't follow the script's sequence of events. To then release the film with a jumbled narrative limits our respect and admiration for the actor because their performance hasn't been brought to the forefront. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has, through his egotistical stupidity, taken what is the best thing about this film and subdued it.From what I can piece together, Penn gives a quite restrained, quiet performance of a man who's been given a new lease on life. Watts plays a kind of damsel in distress, throwing her life away with drugs and alcohol. But her decent into a personal hell is pointless if we don't see her gradual decline. She, more than anyone, is let down by the director's vision. Del Toro is the true saving grace of this film. He's certainly more coherent and audible than most of his past performances. This performance is full of sorrow and regret which seems to be written all over his face. The Academy Award nomination is certainly worthy of his talents.Overall, this film is neither entertaining nor informative in a good way. It does inform you on what not to do and should be shown to film students as a lesson an how to alienate your audience. With some scenes, I couldn't figure out where they were set? Penn lives in a hovel of an apartment yet his luncheon's set in a well to do house. Is this his girlfriend's house? Where is it? Continuity problems would never be noticed if all films were made this way. This is criminally overlong for such a simple story and will cause arguments among the audience as to the relevance of it's non-linear storytelling. If I was one of the people involved in this production, I would feel betrayed and angry over the finished product.",21 Grams
207,Mengedegna,We (sigh) get the movies we deserve,4,11 December 2003,"Alejandro González Iñárritu's ""Amores Perros"" was an intriguing and in places gripping film. It took three essentially unrelated plot lines and, through unashamedly arbitrary dramatic twists, caused them to link and overlap in interesting ways, rather in the manner of stories like Marguerite Yourcenar's ""A Coin In Nine Hands"". This formal device gave the film a substance that helped it transcend the individual plot lines, two of which at least were in themselves rather banal, making the film as a whole more remarkable than the sum of its partsThe danger of such an approach is that plotting and editing come to reign supreme, pushing aside the natural and the human. Gus Van Sant has shown in ""Elephant"" that formalism in the service of a commitment to truth can become transcendent: that, with the right mix of technical devices (camera angles, pacing, subtle juxtaposition of images, sounds and character cues), and with honesty and clarity you can create a work of shattering emotional impact. The trick lies in allowing the material to seem to be developing itself, in giving it room to breathe and come to life. This particular trick is strikingly missing from González Iñárritu's otherwise overstuffed bag.Any film that evokes the death of children (as do both ""Elephant"" and ""21 Grams"") is taking huge risks. The use of a car crash as the agent of fate with which to link divergent characters and plot lines takes the risk further, and using a transplanted heart to link the recipient to the donor's survivor poses a defiant challenge to the viewer's credulity. Screenwriters and directors who abuse their anointed license to serve as the hands of fictional fate weaken their material and risk seeming opportunistic and manipulative. That's what they all are, of course, by definition, the point being that they're supposed to make you suspend disbelief by forgiving, or at least forgetting, this original sin. '21 Grams' flaunts its suit of directorial emperor's clothes with predictably unappetizing results.None of this is helped by the cinematography: in 'Amores Perros', the grainy and sometimes ugly images could be blamed on technical and financial limitations in Mexico (though the subsequent 'Y tu Mamá también' showed that it doesn't take much to achieve visual near-perfection). '21 Grams' was made on a Hollywood budget, so we have to assume that the ugliness, the graininess, the washed-out faces and greenish-hued long shots (as when Benicio del Toro and the wonderful Melissa Leo - who gives what is by far the finest and most honest-feeling performance in the film - meet in a prison visitor's lounge) are all deliberate (and probably done in direct-digital video). The willful achronology of the editing - the way in which the action is sliced and diced, tossed in the air and jammed back into 'Memento'-like intercutting segments - is irritating, confusing, and badly overdone.These technical faults play directly into and thereby reinforce the film's dramatic shortcomings - the over-the-top high-emotional-decibel ranting, particularly by Naomi Watts (who spends most of the movie's second half shrieking and wailing in ways that would be embarrassing at an undergraduate actor's studio), the studied anomie of the Sean Penn character, smoking away before and after his heart transplant (Penn is incapable of being uninteresting, but you sense him going through the motions and remaining detached, in contrast to the depth and richness of texture he gives to his role in 'Mystic River'), the gratuitous condescension and simpering sympathy toward Del Toro's evangelical-lumpen character and all he represents: all this is hard to take. It's the kind of movie at which I just switch off and leave the director and cast to hammer away, hoping they'll all calm down so that something interesting can happen.So what has become of the talent that infused so much of 'Amores Perros', for all its obvious flaws? It peeks through occasionally - the sequence depicting the fateful car crash is done with real mastery, for example, though it comes too late in the film to have the (pun intended, sorry) impact that it should. But on the whole, the baby of 'Amores' is unceremoniously tossed aside the better to wallow in the tepid bathwater. One of the great strengths of 'Amores' had been its sense of place, it's rootedness in Mexico City and nowhere else (even - perhaps especially - where it tellingly evoked the ways in which Mexico City is at risk of becoming like everywhere else). '21 Grams' is supposed to have been filmed on locations in and around Albuquerque(there is even a quick pan of that city's rather nondescript skyline), but no sense of place impinges, other than some generic chaparral. For the exterior shots of the characters' homes, the producers must have spent hours finding the only blocks in Albuquerque without a single adobe house, and not a hint of Mexican culture, New or old, is allowed to penetrate the film's generic Americanness, complete with post-industrial flotsam.In 'Amores Perros', Gomez Iñárritu came across as torn between being a highly gifted existential ironist in the noble tradition of Buñuel and being a boorish, sophomoric emotional manipulator. The latter, of course, was what Hollywood chose to notice and encourage him to exploit, and the result is a film in which his genuine talent flickers only occasionally while his unpleasant high-handedness is given its full head. We Americans are being condescended to en masse in this film, and, given our movie-going proclivities, we probably deserve it. In its cheap emotions and phony virtuosity, this film is worse than bad: it's insulting to its actors and its audience, and the enthusiasm with which it has been greeted in so many reviews speaks for itself: like our politics, we get the films we deserve.",21 Grams

209,rhoughton,A badly edited hotch potch,4,9 February 2004,"If there is a story here, I couldn't find it. It constantly jumped into flashbacks and flash forwards without any reference points at all which only served to confuse. Some people will think this is a clever film, probably because they don't understand it, and what they don't understand, they think must be very clever. The purpose of a motion picture is primarily to entertain. It may make you laugh, it may make you cry, it might challenge you and make you think, it may even do all of the above at the same time. But, a director needs to learn how to tell a story. I wonder if this guy has learned under David Lynch? He's as pretentious and confusing. For me, this film was a waste of time, because it had nothing to say at all.",21 Grams

Usually this kind of story telling is used for the thrilling factor, but this is not the case here, as this movie falls in the genre of drama. Be patient as the the whole picture will be clear at the end-and not before the end. Actually, Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu used this technique to deliver the puzzling situation and coplexity of characters, that they carry their pasts which stands as stumbling blocks infront of going on living their futures. For performances, Sean Penn is fine as always, Del Toro is great, but Watts in incredible(she got the nomination of the academy award for best actress). All the charactershere have their faults that they do not deserve your full empathy. 21 grams is about grieve, revenge, conscience and the fragility of life. It is said that life weighs 21 grams only, so what does it deserve from us? It is rated R for scenes of bloody violence, pervasive language, drug use and sexuality/nudity.",21 Grams
211,janne_w,From the girl who really tries hard to LIKE movies!,2,22 May 2004,"Okay... I'm usually easygoing when reviewing artistic endeavors. I like differences. I love trend setters in movie-making technology. I even like off the wall... and I like creative license belonging to the artists. In some instances, I'm willing to be force fed garbage to get to the meat of a flick, and I've actually ended up loving movies I initially hated.Not this time.I usually try hard to see what someone has tried to convey, and if there is a good message anywhere there, I can find it without a lot of coaxing, but this movie was a big fat waste of time in my DVD player.Even my popcorn and snacks couldn't get me into it.I don't know what the NY Times is using for their rating system, but I did NOT think this was the ""crowning work of this year."" I thought it was probably the worst example of movie making of this year. I'm not a dumb person, and I can follow a tough plot... but when too much of what's going on has to be pieced together or I have to take mental notes along the way and continually rewind the DVD to see where what fits, it's just too darn much energy to spend on a movie that is supposed to entertain me that only ends up befuddling me. If I had gone to the theater to see it, I would've walked out, and I don't walk out on movies.As often happens in Hollywood, once again, the children out-acted the adults here many times over. I've seen a Lot of offerings by Sean Penn in my time, and found most of them to be at least good examples of acting ability. This movie did not challenge him at all. It didn't challenge me, either. I hated it, and would not recommend it to anyone I know. Why? I felt that the lives of the people were too confusing... You couldn't figure out for a long, long, long time how they were even linked together, then when you finally figure it out they keep flashbacking the heck out of you where you feel like you are being jerked in and out of a time machine repeatedly. I really don't like that unless you're dealing with a movie about time travel (for that, I recommend ""Timeline""), not when it dominates every single scene, and it does. I honestly started to believe that Sean Penn's character had a twin brother somewhere, because he kept coming to us from different stages of his life and it was up to us to figure out the stage.I won't say it was boring. I was too busy trying to figure out the point of the movie, and whether or not there was a plot to get bored. I just don't believe plots should be something that are unveiled in the final twenty minutes of a (very long and very confusing) movie. Another thing: The music. There really wasn't any music. Just sounds. Very grating, annoying sounds. Sounds that made me feel angry and irritable, like being trapped in the car with a kid that has a horn or other annoying noisemaker and he keeps blowing it just to get on your nerves. No wonder I was so grouchy by the time this film (finally!) ended.Two thumbs down... If I had more than two, I'd share them too.",21 Grams
212,bangban_tribudiman,"Too depressing, too deep but a strong story",2,30 June 2006,"21 Grams has great acting from start to finish. Sean Penn leading the way as the heart transplant patient, Naomi Watts as the leading actress putting up a stunning display as a grieving widow and Benicio Del Torro as a run down father. Not surprising all of them were nominated for BAFTA's, Golden Globes or Oscars. The story line follows a very grim tale of drugs, depression, murder and revenge, and filmed in a very awkward way. Every cut takes you to another point in time without any clear identification of where you are. The film is mainly all dark and leaves you depressed yet relieved that the characters have done what they set out to accomplish. If depressing movies about drug abuse and shattered minds are your thing then 21 Grams is definitely for you. But if your like me and enjoy the odd depressing tale, I'm a great fan of Mystic River and The Assassination of Richard Nixon. You should perhaps leave this one alone and pick up something lighter. Not really an evening flick with your folks but perhaps something to study for an essay piece. My rating of 2 stars is due to the depressing theme of the movie which leaves you silent for many minutes after watching. The acting is top notch but the plot is very confusing.",21 Grams

It's a bit like Memento in that aspect.Acting is great which is no surprise seeing the cast: Benicio del Torro and Sean Penn are veterans in my opinion, but also Naomi Watts manages to play her role as drug addict annex widow with great depth and conviction. I wasn't impressed by her performances in The Ring and King Kong (but that's maybe because I wasn't that fond of those films themselves) but this is definitely a job well done!",21 Grams

216,arlened324,"A Brilliant Movie is as light as a feather, heavy as a tank, and simply unforgettable",10,8 December 2003,"First I must review the reviewers.  Sunday night in our house it is ""tradition"" to watch Ebert & Roeper.  Will we agree?  Will We disagree?We just happened to see 2 movies this weekend, ""Bad Santa"" (an Ebert & Roeper 3-1/2*) and ""21 Grams"" (an Ebert & Roeper 3*).  My husband and I just shook our heads in disbelief (not to mention disgust).""Bad Santa"" is simply a BAD MOVIE - gross, unsavory, and, in some instances, disgustingly vulgar...a scraggly bearded Santa, always boozing it up, unable to control his bladder, sodomy obsessed = with some dialogue that is not only R but most probably X rated.  After the 2 or 3 times we laughed in the beginning, and we did laugh, the gross vulgarity and sophomoric ""humor"" began to weigh heavily on our psyches.NOW - ""21 Grams"" = a film I thought I would want to walk out of -- surprise, brilliant ensemble acting, incomparable direction, and unbelievable editing that brought each and every particle of this movie together to its unexpected finale...A dark, compelling story of disparate lives brought together -- to kill, to heal.  This is an exceptional film with acting so true and focussed, you stayed with it, following each story and, little by little getting to know each character, inside and out.  Believe me, it all comes together beautifully.I'm still unsettled by the Ebert & Roeper reviews.  I truly believe that comedy is highly subjective - funny to you is disgusting to me and vice versa.  But as far as BAD SANTA goes there just doesn't seem to be an upside - unless it's NOT GOING TO POLLUTE YOUR MIND with that junk!Naomi Watts' performance in ""21 Grams"" is Oscar material.  Benicio del Toro and Sean Penn are magnificent.  Don't let ""21 Grams"" leave your neighborhood before you let it take you on its journey to hell and back again.",21 Grams
217,ildimo1877,"Mr. Inarritu's, so far, finest",8,18 October 2010,"The far superior entry in the Inarritu trilogy of irrevocable despair (could be quadrilogy, etcthough) includes powerhouse performances (an unusually restrained Penn, a usually magnificent Mr. Del Toro and a pitch perfect borderline cataclysmic Ms. Watts) and a theme that won't leave you be. You see life ""doesn't go on"" when certain traumas never heal. This absolutely rare idea goes against the stream of our good old practical times and positively (strange adverb to use in an Inarritu film review, I know) exceeds the ""God laughing"" idea of Amores Perros. This is a film about men of strange, sometimes otherworldly tendencies, to overreach, to sublimate, to love, to find faith, in short to discover the particular texture that differentiates men as species. Mr. Inarritu's direction is never short of impressive – despite his frequent lapses into emotional sadism (his have got to be the gentlest versions of emotional porn we 've ever encountered in the movies) – and his choice to break down the chronological order represents a fine example of beneficial modernism.",21 Grams
218,ivanm-5,Art-house editing can't disguise a turkey!,3,1 July 2005,"It says a lot about this film that at one point I was suddenly reminded of Ed Wood's ""Plan 8 From Outer Space"". I'm referring to the scene when Cristina (Naomi Watts) decides to look for Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro). Done in ""silent movie"" style with an organ music soundtrack it was just like the Bela Lugosi scenes from ""Plan 9"". The only thing lacking was Cresswell's deathless voice-over.Actually, that was probably the most enjoyable part of the movie. Although the director tries (and succeeds at times) to reproduce the look and feel of ""Amores Perros"" the style doesn't sit well with the story. Not that the story is tragically interesting in the first place, as far as it's possible to judge anyway. In any case it seems that the film-makers had so little faith in it that they opted for a bizarre editing scheme that presents the plot in what seems like a random order to try and add a little interest. Sadly this only makes things worse.Okay, the acting is , for the most part , good - though a little over-wrought at times. The visuals are striking (but we've seen them before in Inarritu's previous film) so it's difficult to see how this film got so many awards.

220,berrorg,The most stupid way of making a movie...,1,10 January 2006,"... or how to destroy your own movie trying to be inventive (and fail).It goes like this: If you want to watch this movie (which is 2 hours long) in 50 minutes, all you need to do is watch the first 40 minutes, then fast forward to minute 110 and watch for 5 minutes when a ""revelation"" happens, and if you really want to have ""closure"", fast forward to when the credits begin to roll (ignore the dedication, it's way too pretentious).Normally, I don't comment on movies I hate, why waste time, right? But this one is different because it bothers me that IT COULD HAVE BEEN GOOD in the hands of a real director, not a spoiled baby like this moron from Mexico.The acting is what you can expect from Penn and Watts, very good. Even Del Toro, who I normally don't like, gives an excellent performance, despite the flaws in his character's script.But why, oh why, did Gonzalez (the ""director"") choose to try and ""pull a Tarantino"" again like he tried (and also failed) before in ""Amores Perros"". Can someone please explain to him that the way he edited the movie looks like a freaking 2 hours long trailer of a movie that we actually may want to see? In the first 40 minutes you know 98% of what the whole movie is about. There's only the question of ""Who shot Paul in the end?"". That amounts to the missing 1% of the movie, and the other 1% of the movie is the ""revelation"" that happens in the 110th minute, which I already mentioned.Why would I care for Jacks struggle with his conscience if I already know that he will make it to the end of the movie without killing himself? Why would I care for Paul's wife's strange desire to have his child if I already know that he will end up with Cristina? ... Wait! Do you think I'm spoiling the movie here for you? No! You can see all that in the very first few minutes!Most of the movie you spend it having this mental exercise of trying to identify if this 30 second scene belongs before of after what you just have seen. Its fun, believe me, but it does NOTHING for the movie.Tarantino KNEW how to do it with his Pulp Fiction. Nolan PERFECTED this kind of weird narrative. But when Tarantino decided to go for it as a kind of imaginative and innovative way; and Nolan used his backwards narrative with the justification of getting us into the characters reality and the way he perceived his world (which IMHO is the best example of how to get the audience INTO the movie); this idiot apparently wanted to do it JUST BECAUSE! There is NO justification for ruining a perfectly linear story of life, death, sin, and redemption, with these cheap gimmicks of ""pseudo-cinematography"".But don't get me wrong, the story itself is not so great either; I'm just saying that it would have been ""not so bad"" if they would have treated differently. There are too many senseless sub-plots to consider it a good story, especially when you get to know who shot Paul (that was plainly ridiculous).Tell you what, rent any Jennifer Lopez movie, stick it into your DVD player, and play it with the ""shuffle"" function on, and you'll get an Alejandro González Iñárritu movie.Then you won't have to mourn for all the wasted talent of real actors.",21 Grams

222,bencsik-laszlo91,A powerful and thoughtful drama,9,27 July 2015,"If i have to sum up 21 Grams, i would say: it's very human. It is able to authentically represent human features, feelings and every character has a reason to sympathize with. We witness 3 fates which are inexplicably connected with each other. Each storyline is tragic in its own way, they may originate from different sources but tragedy is the main element that all of them have in common.In this case, the nonlinear narrative works very well. In spite of it's length, the movie is capable of maintaining interest from the beginning till the end. Jumping back and forth in time can be confusing in the first 20 minutes but those who pay attention will see the relations and presume the whole image. Furthermore, this technique has the ability to avoid boring and long-drawn moments (because of the shortness of the scenes).There's not much to talk about the story. The plot is basically the frame and it's main purpose to ensure a ""breeding ground"" for human emotions and relationships, it did it well. The 3 basic story lines are logically connected with each other and this is the evidence of a well constructed story. However, we receive only small pieces of information about each character, so the final outcome still remains unknown.There is no typical good or bad which makes each character very human. Their actions are reasonable and understandable, there is cause- effect relationship behind every act. All of them have positive and negative features as well, so everyone has the chance to find a character that he/she can identify with.21 Grams deals with global and common subjects like : loss of a beloved person, seeking redemption, overwhelmed by anger which leads to revenge, power of regret, an old injury from the past, faith as the key to salvation etc. It visualizes many well-known positive and negative human features which authentically came through thanks to outstanding actors.In the end we all have to face Death sooner or later, it's just a matter of time. This topic raises questions like : Where does life begin and where does it end? What will happen after death? Is there anything? 21 Grams ended with an unanswered question and Iñárritu entrust the decision to the audience. This final scene makes us think and wonder... What is out there?",21 Grams

227,honkus,An Overwhelming Work of Art,10,27 April 2004,"If you're not moved by this film, you might need a heart transplant. Three of the greatest actors of our time (Sean Penn, Benicio del Toro, and Naomi Watts) take an extremely tragic script that could have so easily been turned into overbearing pretentious claptrap, and instead create an ultra-realistic, natural, and utterly heart-wrenching film. A lot has been made of the non-linear presentation, but although it may at first seem confusing and unnecessary (and it may not fit the plot as well as a non-linear masterpiece like Tarantino's Pulp Fiction), it soon becomes apparent that the emotional power of each scene would be overwhelming without timely breaks and setting changes. This and other fine stylistic choices from the director create a consistent mood that is inescapable and soul-shaking. But by far the strongest part of this film is the acting. I simply can't remember a film in which all of the major performances were so believably, stunningly, done. Each of the three stars threaten to steal the show, but I was most taken with Naomi Watts's work. She impressed me greatly in David Lynch's Mullholland Drive (especially the soap opera audition scene), but her performance here is nothing short of spectacular. Her reaction to learning of her family's death at the hospital is the most realistic reaction to life-changing loss I have ever seen in film. Coming early in the film, it was at this point that I realized I was watching a masterpiece. If you are a person who goes to the theater to be influenced and moved by art, as opposed to just having a good time, you MUST see this film. Of course, make sure you're in the right state of mind -- you have to drop your defenses, make yourself vulnerable to the film, let it in and scrape your insides out, and accept its heartbreak as your own.",21 Grams

In a nutshell, is any other film's narrative  so badly fractured that you don't even care about the various dramas/melodramas played out:  divorce, failed rehabilitation, the loss of a husband and two innocent children in a car accident, etc. etc...you just view everything with a detached confusion, and you're left outraged that you lost any opportunity to connect with the story and the fine acting because of the pretentious, heavy-handed direction.(I never considered myself a great fan of Clint Eastwood, but compare this movie's narrative to that of Mystic River.  In Mystic River, you care so much about the three main characters, and all of the supporting players -- the theme(s) are disturbing and compelling enough, and the director allows you to know the characters to a great extent as both the mystery and suspense build to a crescendo.  In Grams, you have none of that --you are just jerked around, maybe to hide how ridiculous the story would be if presented more conventionally?)To this point, I have seen no other film(s) by this director.  He may indeed be talented, as perhaps it takes a talent to misfire so badly on a film. And, I do not mind a non-linear device if it serves the story.  In Memento, this device works because the sudience is processing the mystery as the main charcter himself is.  The non-linear projection also heightens the plot and irony of Pulp Fiction.In Grams, it felt like the scenes were shot in whatever order (that's ok), and than the director numbered them, and threw them into a hat for the order they would be presented to the audience.  As such, the movie lost any sense of continuity with the themes and the characters.  It made for a singularly frustrating movie-going experience.  A majority of critics have praised this film as both intelligent and respecting the same intelligence from the audience.  I'm sorry, but is it audience participation when the questions you are compelled to ask are on the order of: ""When did this happen?""  ""Is that the same lady?""  ""Did she change her mind?""  ""Why did she change her mind?""   ""When will this pretentious exercise be over?""Speaking for myself, this movie was a terrible misfire, and the directing style robbed us of any chance to connect with the characters and the themes he was trying to present. Instead, I was angry that I could not enjoy the performances (especially Watts'), as the movie had already lost me so much earlier. By the time we get to Penn's ending narration (a la American Beauty?), I just laughed at the pretentiousness, and almost wanted to cry about all of the lost opportunities to make a decent film that you cared about.Somehow, 21 Grams made imdb's top 250 of all time. For me, it may not have been one of the Top 250 of 2003.",21 Grams
229,tgemberl,Deeply compassionate view of human life,10,6 May 2005,"If you only watch movies for entertainment, this is clearly not for you. But if you want to deal with the human condition, it is. I had to see it twice to appreciate it completely, and of course it takes some endurance to do so. It had me bawling for days. I think Guillermo Arriaga intended some very deep symbolism here. Sean Penn's character appears to be a ""Christ figure"" in the movie. Towards the end, he grabs a gun and shoots himself while Naomi Watts and Benicio del Toro are fighting on the other side of the room. If he had done what we would normally expect and shot Benicio del Toro, the signs of reconciliation that we can detect near the end of the movie would not have been possible. He and Christina (Naomi Watts) would have spent the rest of the film running from the law or otherwise trying to hide the fact that they'd killed him, and, I suppose, justifying the act to themselves because ""he deserved it."" But as it is, there is room for reconciliation at the end because of what Sean Penn does. I'll admit that my idea that there's reconciliation might seem doubtful to some of you. The reason I think there's a bit of reconciliation is that in one of the very last shots of the film, while the narrative voice-over is on, you see Christina turn to Benicio del Toro while he speaks to her. I think that in a film like this, written by someone like Arriaga, there is reason to read even small details like that in such an optimistic way. And actually, because the film is giving us what we could call a ""God's-eye view"" of these people's lives, the exact degree of Christina's reconciliation with Benicio del Toro's character is not that important. What is important is that Arriaga has shown us there is potential for reconciliation. And as you might guess, I interpret Christina's pregnancy at the end as being a sort of resurrection. She lost her family, and Sean Penn's love has given her another one. At the very end, you see her in her daughters' bedroom, cradling her pregnant abdomen and holding one of her daughter's stuffed animals. Earlier in the film, she had said she could not bear to step into their room. I also wonder if Arriaga intended Penn's wife to be a sort of representation of Law, given that she's always trying to ""manage"" his life and get him to do sensible things like not smoking. Much of what she demands seems sensible, but in the context of his life, it doesn't seem to work. And you might notice that later, when he attempts to get Christina to stop using drugs, he is more understanding of her position than his wife had been of his. What finally gets her to stop using drugs (I assume) is the new life he has given her, rather than someone browbeating her. Another real powerful character in the movie that might seem rather minor is Christina's drug dealer in the bar. The actress, whose name I couldn't identify because IMDb's page doesn't seem to identify her as a drug dealer, did a real good job of depicting that sort of role and its place in the life of someone like Christina. I think it's also interesting to notice that Christina does not disclose any of her sorrow when talking to her. She can just smile and nod affirmatively when she asks if she ""married that hunk"" and whether he's ""a good lay."" This is a purely commercial relationship, so Christina feels no need to disclose her inner life. Some of you might be thinking, ""you're ruining the movie for me,"" but this film is so hard to watch that if you don't think there's going to be something of a ""happy ending,"" be it ever so tentative, you might not be able to get through it. And of course I understand if you decide it's not for you after watching a few minutes of it. It is real tough to watch.",21 Grams
230,Abdo0079,Amusing like a Puzzle,8,9 January 2017,"I liked this film so much .. The story is good but Iñárritu style of telling the story makes it more interesting .. I didn't feel bored during the movie . You try to catch up with the events and what happened first and last , Who the hell are those guys , Are they good or bad !! makes you think the whole movie and even in the middle of it when you think you've got the event sequence and the story is told , it's still interesting , you can just enjoy the acting of the actors especially Naomi .. The film gives a meaning about what death and its circumstances bring to everyone around .. The story telling style is different and interesting ; it's not pure backwards ( like memento for example ) .. Scenes are shuffled in a way that makes you work your mind and enjoy this piece of art .. The only thing I wished it had been better is the music , That could have been more and more touching than what it is alreadyAbsolutely watchable , no regrets ..",21 Grams
231,kaibab-2,Be a careful driver,6,21 January 2004,The most I took away from this film was a reminder to drive carefully.  I found the film ponderous and self-conscious.  The most interesting part was the picture-puzzle editing. The most disappointing was the under-explained and poorly developed relationship between Penn's character and Watts' character.,21 Grams
232,GJBStar,Some flaws in this ambitious film,7,21 March 2004,"After the 2001 Mexican smash ""Amores Perros"", Inarritu follows it up with his English language debut.  21 Grams is a story told in a non-linear form connecting the 3 protagonists stories together around a car crash.  To this end, it is likely that 21 Grams will draw parallels to Inarritu's previous work.  However, one should look beyond comparisons.As for the protagonists, it is Penn who is the central performance in this picture as the ill Maths teacher in need of a heart transplant.  He is brought closer to Naomi Watts' drug-addled grieving mother, Christina and they in turn, are both related to Benicio del Toro.Despite Penn being the central character, his story is perhaps the least satisfying.  In a stale and somewhat unconvincing relationship one minute and close to his deathbed the next, it is possibly his story which is least served by the director's non-linear approach to the material.  While we do feel his suffering physically, emotionally Penn's character bears far less than either of the other two protagonists.Instead, the emotional pivot of the film is Benicio del Toro.  Clearly a troubled soul from the beginning of the film, he gives an excellent, multi-faceted performance, whether the backdrop be church, jail or at home. His character is underpinned by a strong set of beliefs and an uncompromising personality which makes his character fascinating.  Equally strong and deserving of recognition is Melissa Leo as del Toro's suffering wife, unconvinced of her husband's conviction of belief and at a loss as to how to counterbalance this in her family's upbringing.  Her emotionally frayed performance makes us really feel for her and her children and we feel her despair.Somewhere in the middle of the two leading males performances is Naomi Watts who certainly holds her own against the two fine male leads on show.  Her character is also one who has previously been somewhat troubled and has flaws.  However, her slightly detached approach to  her family at the beginning makes it hard for us to be completely sympathetic to her plight as the film progresses.  However, she is at her best in some of the hospital scenes and her grief seems real.21 Grams is unusual in that it is a film based on its strong acting which is equally noteworthy for its structure and narrative.  Whilst the direction and cinematography are both solid and in particular, the cinematography stands out, both are destined to be overshadowed by the editing and narrative of this film.  Whilst del Toro and Watts are served well by the editing, Penn is not and it is indeed, mainly Penn's role that suggests that the non-linear is designed to hide the fact that the narrative by itself is not enough to sustain the viewer's interest for the whole film.  I felt in places the substance of the piece was somewhat thin and was padded out by the necessity of review because of the structure.Ultimately, the acting is far superior to the other elements of this film particularly the narrative.  Whilst the narrative itself left me somewhat cold in places, the acting still drew me in to the protagonist's lives.  21 Grams is said to be the weight of the soul departing the body, yet in places I felt that the soul had already left and that, the film was little more than an editing showcase.  Despite its flaws, 21 Grams should be applauded for its ambition and Inarritu's ability to draw out top class performances from his actors.  A strong effort. 7/10",21 Grams
233,xiayun,A powerful movie with great acting,9,8 November 2004,"The first 30 minutes confused the heck out of me until I realize it's following a Memento-like style of story-telling and editing. Then I rewinded and started again, and the back-and-forth scenes started to fit a lot better with each other. It is not just one way backward or forward; instead, it's like a jigsaw puzzle. You really have to pay attention to piece everything together. The movie is filled with great performances. Sean Penn had more to show off his talent in Mystic River, but what he did here is equally amazing. Naomi Watts and Benicio del Toro deserved their nominations as well. The story is as depressing as it gets, but I was hooked to it the whole way. Very powerful. 9 out of 10.",21 Grams
234,richards1052,Lost Souls in a Grim Land,7,31 December 2003,"Spoiler Alert! My wife & I saw ""21 Grams"" and were extremely disappointed.  I'd been enticed by Elvis Mitchell's glowing review, ""Hearts Incapacitated, Souls Wasting Away"" in the New York Times:""It's too early to call it a crowning work of a career - this is only his second film - but it may well be the crowning work of this year.""  I think not.  The film's premise might have made a deeply powerful piece of art.  Casting too, promised many wonderful performances from the likes of Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro.In the film, a woman's family is wiped out by a hit and run driver.  Her dead husband's heart is given to a dying heart patient who is drawn to her because of her tie to the heart donor.  But the execution of the concept in this film is not successful for me.Let's talk about tone: this film is GRIM, GRIM, GRIM.  I have nothing against 'grim' in films.  Some of the greatest films are fundamentally grim. But this one is unrelentingly grim.  There isn't a single character major or minor for whom I felt any sympathy.Let's take a single scene featuring Benicio del Toro's ravaged ex-con turned angry Christian.  Sitting at the dinner table, del Toro's son smacks his sister.  When she tries to hit her brother back, del Toro tells her menacingly that she must learn to turn the other cheek when someone hits her.  He jumps across the table and holds his daughter's face and screams at his son to hit her.  When the petrified boy refuses, del Toro bellows at him to hit her.  He finally does.  But then both daughter and son collapse in tears and his wife leaves the table, disgusted to console them.  Nice fellow, don't you think?Now, let's talk about implausible plot developments.  Just after the funeral, the widow declares that she doesn't even have a desire to press charges against the hit and run driver saying: ""What would it prove?"" Yet after meeting and falling in love with Sean Penn's character, she suddenly develops a burning, unquenchable thirst for revenge: ""We've got to kill him,"" she says.  A little discongruity you say?  Sure is.And in the climactic scene in which Sean Penn, del Toro and Naomi Watt each struggle with a loaded gun, Penn's character decides to end the fight by shooting himself in the heart.  If I killed myself in the middle of every argument I've ever wanted to stop, I'd have at least nine lives if not more.Finally (and this to me was one of the more annoying features of the film), the editing.  It appears the film editor and director wanted to jumble up the scenes so that you couldn't tell when the action took place.  Is this Sean Penn scene after the heart transplant or before?  Is this Naomi Watt scene before her family's death or after?  Unlike ""Memento,"" in which the action is shown in reverse chronological order, the jumbled chronology in ""21 Grams"" seems willful and perverse, as if it were thrown into the film to throw the viewer's 'center of balance' off.We left the theater feeling very unsatisfied.",21 Grams
235,DubVersion,"If you don't have a story to tell, DON'T try covering it up with idiotic editing",4,18 January 2005,"The acting in this movie is great. The scenery was good. However two very irritating facts crush this movie: 1. The editing is simply bad and only there to try to confuse the viewer 2. the story is way too thin for a 2+ hrs movie. 4/10**** SPOILERS AHEAD *****The director tried to mimic ""Memento""; a far better movie in every sense. In this movie, the editing makes no sense. It is very incoherent in the beginning and there's not much to invite you to want to know more about it. Some scenes are put at a very wrong place, because it reveals EVERYTHING. There is no surprising moment at all in this movie, and i never read any reviews or plot summary I watch it unbiased. So the movie just drags on telling its story...and what really is the story ? A man is ill, gets a heart from a victim of a freak accident. He falls in love with the widow and then fails to kill of the killer. That's it. There is no hint on why they was on bad terms with their life before the accident. Del Toro had a very supporting wife; the widow seemed to have a loving husband and children and Penn remarried his first wife. So there's no incentive leading to the over dramatized world of these people. Get a life !But by the time you know the accidents happen, you're just wondering where each scene fits in. Did we just have a flashback or we back to present again ? This thought keeps you so busy that you forget to actually enjoy the scenes. If you want to see how NOT to edit a movie, go check out this one.So despite the editor and director, i give this movie 4 out of 10, because the acting is convincing. So one point for each actor. I just wasted 2+ hrs of my time on this one though.",21 Grams
236,Penoyer1,Well worth the effort,8,11 April 2004,"I had to endure the first 30 minutes or so before this movie made any sense, but after that it really hooked me.  This is not a movie to rent if you want an easy watch, but if you're in the mood to intensely watch an intense study of people's interactions and figure it out bit by bit this is well the time.  One negative is the lovemaking scene between Penn and Watts.  It is very clear what their relationship is without this scene which sort of breaks up what is otherwise a tightly structured story.  Clearly thrown in simply for the sake of the nudity, which is not a bad thing but always irritates me in what is otherwise a well made film.",21 Grams
237,rserrano,brilliant editing central to meaning,7,25 August 2004,"Many reviews have commented on the films' unique editing style, viewing it as negative to neutral. This style is however at the heart of how we experience the movie and its' central theme of personal transformation from tragedy. It is what makes it great, as opposed to simply very good.In a typical ""linear"" movie, the audience is at liberty to go along for the ride, standing at an emotional distance, until the pay off at the end. If the payoff is satisfying, we feel that it was worthwhile. In 21 Grams, the editing style, which is composed of choppy, short, seemingly disjointed scenes, does not allow this. It mimics the frantic, haphazard way we remember painful events. It forces us into a different type of involvement. We find ourselves puzzling over ""What's past, present and future? How are the events interconnected? Who are these people and how are they interconnected?"". By engaging us intellectually we can not help but be drawn in emotionally as well.The pay off is in the closing moments of the film when each of the three main characters undergo a subtle but important transformation as a result of the intense suffering that they have endured. Having been pulled in, we too can experience a glimpse of this.",21 Grams

This movie might be a bit confusing in the beginning, but after some twenty minutes, the became so gripping and didn't let me go until the end.It is a very exciting story told in partly opressing pictures, which really make you share the character's troubles. When the movie is was over and the credits began, I had to remain sitting for a few minutes. 21 grams is the most riveting as well as the best acted movie I've ever seen.",21 Grams
239,doom-ca,Excellent movie - you'll need to pay attention,8,24 April 2013,"Profound is probably the word I would use to describe 21 grams. The basic plot of the movie one man gaining the heart of another through transplant and his subsequent interest in finding out who the donor was makes for excellent adventure and thick drama. That said this is not an action adventure film by any means, it is a profound retrospective of life, that tries to tackle the big questions, what is the meaning of it all? Is there a God, what's the whole purpose of this adventure, why take away the life of one person only to grant it to another? And why given all we've grown up to believe is life taken or granted seemingly on a whim? (btw not Taken as in Harrison Ford Taken - not that kinda movie) Some large questions that are attempted heroically by the writer of this movie, while he/she attempts them be sure to note they are humble enough to realize that only through the cinema and a chronological quagmire of ambiguity and balanced tension do they attempt to answer them. You'll notice this plot formation keeps you aware and wondering where is this movie going, who is doing what to whom and for what reason? The acting is excellent, in only a few spots was I removed from the lines delivered by the actors, and thought, that didn't seem realistic or that felt forced. Most of the time you will be engaged, questioning, feeling some emotion and most of all come away asking more about the big questions. Enjoy the flick if you've never seen it and your a serious movie buff you'll love it. If you are looking for something comparable - I'd say theme wise ""Tree of Life"" action wise name any IMDb movie with a solid seven rating. Take care and enjoy Seebs",21 Grams
240,tkleeman,Nice acting but a mess,5,22 March 2004,"This seems to be a perfectly nice film that the director decided to cut into little pieces and rearrange randomly.  There is no pattern and what is left is simply confusion.  Things become clearer by the end, but there is no excuse for this sort of self-indulgent narcissism. Great performances all around, and a beautiful love scene, but who wants to solve the director's crossword puzzle just to understand what is basically a pretty straightforward story? I found it difficult to connect to the characters because their stories are presented in such a piecemeal and distracted fashion.  On the whole, a rather overrated movie, but redeemed by great performances by Naomi Watts and Benecio del Toro.",21 Grams

The casting, the scenes, the script, the music, everything seemed in harmony.Inarritu's directing needs no words for this movie. It was a work of art. The story-telling was almost perfect with one or two certain points where I felt what was coming, but hey, nothing is perfect.The acting is good enough for me to watch without breathing. Sean Penn is enormous. I have been a fond of his acting as well as his character and it has been a great feeling watching him in this movie. Also Naomi Watts has been improving as she aged and I hope she will use this in better ways in the upcoming projects.One more thing is about music. The music is so effective in the movie.

When I left the cinema, I had to take a few deep breaths at what I had just witnessed for the past two hours or so.  21 Grams follows three characters who are brought together after a tragic accident.  The movie jumps around chronologically throughout and at first was difficult to understand the main plot of the movie because of the frequency of the time jumps, however it all came together in the end.Sean Penn gives a brilliant performance in the lead role as a terminally ill Maths Professor.  Benicio Del Toro plays the role of a criminal who is trying hard to follow the religion that he has turned to to improve his life and similiarly it is a very good performance.  However for me, Naomi Watts steals the show with an astonishing performance as a drug addict who's life is destroyed following one tragic incident.  Her acting throughout this movie is extremely realistic, powerful and emotional.  During some of her scenes, the silence in the cinema was deathly, you could have heard a pin drop.All in all this is a brilliant movie, very dark, powerful and brutally confrontational with human emotions.  It will stay in your mind after the credits roll and you will have to breathe deeply at what you have just seen.",21 Grams

Either way, I was under the impression that the 21 Grams was a drug reference. Apparently, 21 Grams is supposed to be how much your soul weighs. This is based on a few occasions where someone was weighed immediately prior to, and immediately after death, and the 21 Grams difference between the two weighings was thought to be the weight of the soul. I had never heard of this before, but it is interesting. There *is* drug use in the movie, but I think it's coincidental. I liked this movie, which I watched because I like Naomi Watts, but I have to admit, this movie would be really depressing except that there is so much irony in the tragic occurrences that they are funny. Not that I laughed, but the humor in the irony, helped balance out the tragic events. I don't know if I've explained that clearly enough, but I liked the movie.

246,ghostofdaniel,21 grams : a stupid title.,5,15 June 2004,"The advertisement said : ""21 grams : the weight of a soul"". So, I was waiting for a fantasy movie about the controversial theories on the ""after-death"". (A movie like ""Poltergeist"" or ""Brainstorm"").What a disappointment ! The ""21 grams theory"" is evoked only during the last minute and I must say I don't see any link between this theory and this movie.In fact, the story is about the relationship between 1/ a man who has been transplanted with the heart of a man, 2/ the wife of his ""saver"" and 3/ the man who has killed his ""saver"". The beginning of this story is boring and conventional, but the director have the good idea to use the flash-backs method to give suspense and interest to his story. The flash-backs work like ""trailers"", and I really was unable to stop viewing the movie !But when the movie ends, I asked to myself : ""So what ? What's the fuzz about the ""21 grams"" ? What happens to Jack ? Where is the conclusion ? Is Christina forgiving to him ? Is Jack forgiving to himself, and finding the force to live ?..."". No answers ! What a frustration !Well, I'm disappointed by this movie, but only at the very end.

247,nikecjc,The Three Top Actors Shine...,10,29 January 2004,"Simply put, you'd be hard-pressed to find three actors (actresses are actors in my mind) than those of Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, and Benicio Del Toro.21 Grams united them all under a rising, brilliant director. It gives them a story that interlocks the lives of three desperate soles, searching for the answers to the brutal questions life has asked them.If that sounds a little cliche, I apologize.Plainly put, see this movie. Rent it, download it (gasp, did I say that?), and when the time comes please purchase it.Thee storytelling is that of Tarantino brilliance. A dash of Christopher Nolan (Mememto) can be seen as well.And in the end, it's the Oscar-caliber performances of Penn, Watts, and Del Toro that take over the movie.Sean Penn's performance is, if not equal, surpasses that of his award-winning turn in Mystic River. (Which I easily compare this movie to with its amazing sense for plot and character co-development.)Naomi Watts takes the final step (Mullholland Drive thrust her to the forefront as is) to becoming one of the finest actresses in movies today. If you don't agree, watch her during the movie's most vivid and touching scene (there we so many to choose from) in which she receiver grave information at the hospital. (No spoilers further than this will be found in this post.) Watts not only delivers every emotion that character is feeling, but shows you nearly face-to-face with what she is dealing with. It's mind-blowing.Del Toro. Well, the guy put out a top 10 performance of the past twenty-five years in Traffic...and he doesn't dissapoint here. In fact, several times throughout the movie you almost believe that he was the only star worth watching.Again, this movie is brilliant. If you desire deep, powerful acting...check this movie out. If you desire plot development that shifts around, much as life, leaving you only more and more intrigued...check this movie out.I could do this for days.Just, check this movie out.",21 Grams
248,erialc,"powerful, meaningful, thought-provoking",8,7 April 2004,"Immediately after seeing this movie, I didn't know what to think. I wasn't blown away by it, and the film experience was so intense that I couldn't fall in love with it instantaneously. During the course of the two hours, I've been presented with too many emotions, too many draining and intense revelations that I felt exhausted. I needed time to think, to absorb it. Now, days later, I can still envision scenes, specific episodes, from the movie vividly. I'm still haunted by the power that `21 grams' exudes.Much has been said about the movie's simple plot, so I hesitate at disclosing more only because much of the film experience is actually the process of putting together the fragmented pieces yourself.
With that said, we come naturally to perhaps the most talked about subject regarding this film: its non-linear structure. Though presented in a non-sequential manner, the film is not without a clear delineation of logic and chronology. Scenes from the beginning, middle and end are shown during the course of the movie. But as time progresses, the originally short, episodic lapses are turned into longer and more organized divisions that follow a more sequential order to finally bring a closure to the film. I don't think comparisons to other films such as `Memento' are necessary and they'll not do justice to the one in discussion. Here, the fragmented structure serves to add interest to an otherwise potentially clichéd and overly simplistic story line. As oppose to concentrating on `what will happen', we find ourselves knowing the endpoints but are intrigued in seeking the course in which these ends connect. In other words, the structure allows the audience to focus more on the process, the `How's' and `Why's' rather than the results, the `What's'. By doing so, it also gives the stage to showcase the tremendous talents of its actors.The acting is the bulwark of `21 Grams.' Though powerful, the performances are not overly explosive; yet, in their subtleties, a range of heart-felt emotions are expressed, revealed. Grief, sorrow, the pain of losing your loved ones; guilt, remorse, the fear of living after experiencing a life-changing tragedy; frustration, despair, but also love, and the hope that offers one the strength to cling onto life. All three leads (Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, Benicio del Toro) give extraordinary performances. Penn proves himself to be one of the best of his generation, if not the best. Del Toro displays his talents once again in giving such an emotional and realistic portrayal of Jack. Yet, I have to say it was Watts who captured my heart the most. Cristina, the vulnerable, grief-stricken mother caught in a downward spiral that almost led her to destruction, comes to life through Watts' portrayal. Her ability to convey raw emotions so uninhibitedly and so convincingly persuades me to say that she has, in her fairly short career span, proven to be one of best actresses working today, and certainly a rare thing in Hollywood.The film's effective structure and its first-rate performances, however, do not automatically mean that it is without flaws. But to me, its strengths more than enough made up for the weaknesses. So my advice: See it, think about it, and take away from it what you will. Though you probably won't be entertained, it'll not be a waste of time for your mind. The haunting effects of `21 Grams' will leave you emotionally drained for days.",21 Grams
249,rsmall1806,A compelling motion picture,9,20 May 2012,"21 Grams (2003) Iñárritu from Mexico directed this film. 21 grams is the amount of weight a body is said to lose at the moment of death. Paul (Sean Penn) plays a seriously ill mathematics professor, before and after a heart transplant. Christina (Naomi Watts) takes the part of a recovering drug addict with two small girls and a loving husband. Naomi Watts and Sean Penn make full use of their acting skills. Spoiler alert stop here. Benicio del Toro plays Jack, alcoholic. Christina loses her husband and children in a tragic accident caused by Jack's careless driving. I got tired of Benedicto del Toro's overdone mea culpa behavior. Paul gets Christina's husband's heart. Heart transplant recipients may acquire personality traits of the donor from ""cellular memory"". Paul is strongly attracted to Christina. He approaches her gently. The opening scene shows Christina asleep and Paul sitting on the bed smoking, both naked. Flash backs confuse or add an avant-garde touch depending on your point of view. The film includes hate, guilt, suicidal depression, anger, fear, confusion, helplessness, violence, love, addiction, sex, etc. Christina discovers she is pregnant with Paul's child. Paul dies. Jack goes back to his family. The credits list Penn, Del Toro and Watts in that order. I list Watts, Penn and Del Toro in order of good acting.",21 Grams

But all he seemed to do was either sit around smoking or sit in a car stalking Naomi Watts ( I do not blame him for this, she is major talent) and when the film got really 'exciting' he did both.The film did not go anywhere and was so slow I thought time had stopped. I found myself nearly sobbing in frustration of this depressing tale. Not even seeing Naomi Watts in all her glory could not save this dire waste of film. This film should come with a hazard warning as it is dangerous to my health.2/10",21 Grams

I would say that everything about it is perfect, but i was especially impressed by the way the story is told. The fragmented scenes that jump back and forth in time, slowly build up the complete picture, making clear how everything relates together. Yet, the movie does not make a fragmented impression, it is a perfect mosaic of topmost artistic quality. The acting is phenomenal, with no exception, giving extra power to an original and gripping story. I was glued to the screen and could feel the emotions of the characters. Also a special note to the sound, that is done very well and plays an important role in the whole atmosphere that is created. With the changing of scenes the soundscape also changes, sometimes from noisy to total silence, or the other way around. And always in perfect sync with the visuals. A real piece of art, that certainly deserves a 10",21 Grams

How much does 21 grams weigh?"" The violence, when I turned my head, was worth it first to see Melissa Leo again, her natural power so missed from NYPD Blue, and the signature understated grasp of Sean Penn.

254,yiNXs,Very disappointing.. wrong title..,3,3 January 2005,"When I started this movie I was expecting an interesting theory of the 21 grams mystery. Especially since the rating is so high I expected something very thought out, but I could not me more disappointed after seeing it.The story is a simple dramatic story, nothing special. It's a nice story, but something for TV. They tried to make it more spectacular by the way it is put together, like: no linear timeline, which can be good if it had use for the whole story, but in this movie it was useless and just annoying. Or (even worse): scenes where nothing happens, somebody is just sitting and thinking (could have a function, but hasn't in this movie). Clearly all put there to make it seem like more. To much ""sauce"" to cover up the bad taste. It didn't fool me.I'm sure the ""21 grams"" name is made up just before finishing it, because it has nothing to do with the whole story. Just at the end something is said about the 21 grams. It's clearly quickly put in there and it's nothing more than the known fact. It was quite stupid. The creator definitely had no clue what to think or say about it and just said something to have at least something to justify the name of the movie. He probably just read an article a few days before finishing the movie.It's such a cheap way of making a movie more interesting. ""How much does life weigh"". Well, I can think of a dozen of those silly questions: ""What is the color of life"", ""What is the volume of life"", ""What is the dimension of life"", ""What is the density of life"", etc... Then create a movie (could be about anything), and put that as cover question. Than ending it with just some recently read fact about that question, and voila! Pseudo artistic movie made! Good reviews received, because mingling the timeflow of the scenes makes a movie so much more ""artistic"".. I would have also made it black and white... That would probably beat godfather.. Oh please..Worth a 4..",21 Grams
255,jordandw,10/10 on the sheer basis of outstanding acting,10,26 December 2005,"I saw that this film was ranked #249 out of 250 on the IMDb all-time list, and felt compelled to add a 10 vote to keep it on the list. This is a very troubling and difficult film to watch (a la Requiem for a Dream) but, like that film (also excellent), it is the riveting characterizations of the lead actors that just sends the film over the threshold of greatness. I can never think of Naomi Watts and Benicio del Toro again without remembering their outstanding jobs in this film. Melissa Leo, a lesser role, but a great contribution also. And as much as I grapple with the question of how good Sean Penn is an an actor, he forces a nod here in a tremendous job of acting that, I believe, overshadows his role in Mystic River that year that landed him the Oscar. This is the better acting job. Small time hood with violence near the top of his repertoire is not that much of a stretch for him, but terminally ill math professor for whom violence is unwelcome but seemingly made inevitable by the onslaught of life's turns (Straw Dogs, anyone?) certainly is. Difficult subject matter, masterfully done, and with a tremendous line-up of acting talents that carry it off memorably.",21 Grams
256,WWFStern,"A weighty, but mysteriously draggy, melodrama",9,24 January 2004,"WARNING:  Newspaper-style movie review, including plot discussion.If one sets the bar for a movie being ""long"" at two hours, more and more movies are moving into long territory. When a film is lengthy, it bears an extra responsibility to the audience to keep us interested throughout the running time. Certain films, like Mulholland Dr. and Fight Club, are so mesmerizing that the hours fly by. Other films, no matter how good they may be, feel every minute of their length, and perhaps more. 21 Grams is just such a film. Though it runs just a few minutes more than two hours, it feels about 20 minutes longer. Therefore, despite powerhouse acting and a good story, the film simply cannot reach A-level.Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro are at the forefront of the film throughout and each deserves an Oscar nomination for the riveting performances this film boasts. Penn plays Paul Rivers, a former playboy who now, while dying from a defective heart, is dependent upon his wife for the first time. Watts portrays Cristina Peck, a former drug abuser who falls back into her dangerous habit after a personal catastrophe. Del Toro completely morphs into Jack Jordan, a lifelong criminal who has been taught to embrace Christianity as a way of turning his life around.
Each of the stories is tragic, and each intersects. Rivers receives the news that a heart donor may be available, but at a hefty cost to another key character. Jordan throws all his soul into reforming himself and becoming a true family man, but a tragic accident leaves him more alone than ever before. His newly discovered conscience bears down heavily, while his wife urges him to forget the overpowering guilt. If this film is a mood piece, that mood is unquestionably tragic. This being the case, the film ends the only way it can--with a death.The film is laid out in a nonlinear fashion for the first half, and a more chronological way after that. Flashes of the concluding scenes are shown in the beginning, but audiences are initially working so hard to get their bearings that little is actually given away. Rather, our interest is piqued by the drama we are sure lies ahead. Some may argue that the nonlinear technique is unnecessary here--and it probably is not needed to maintain the story's power--but throwing audiences into the middle of the action while moving back and forth in time is a great way to immediately involve everyone in the story. It works that way here.Alejandro González Iñárritu, who helmed the critically popular 2000 picture Amores Perros, directs the film. His visual style is very interesting, and similar to Jane Campion's in her recent misfire In the Cut. The image is grainy and gritty, but not in a way that is distracting or hard on the eyes (like Soderbergh's Full Frontal was). Iñárritu's two films also share the same screenwriter, Guillermo Arriaga. His dialogue is particularly good here, and the characters both interesting and fully realized.
Many people may wonder what the title of this film means. There is a closing monologue by one of the characters that tries to relate it to the film itself, not entirely successfully (though Arriaga's words are poetic as usual). ""21 grams"" refers to the amount of weight that a person is purported to lose at the precise moment of death. Some believe this is the weight of the soul, and others a natural, physiological occurrence; the actuality is unknown. But this good, weighty film speaks for itself, title aside, and is just a step or two shy of being great.Final Grade: B+",21 Grams

Basically all the main characters were impressive, but what I wasn't impressed with was the story.  I thought it was ok, but the way it was told made me wanting to turn off the movie.  You figure out the connections between the characters pretty quickly and for the rest of the movie your watching the characters meet each other.  I didn't see any new developments coming after a certain point and I would have been just as satisfied if I turned the movie off halfway through.  The ending monologue was good, but it took too long to get to and by that point I had already made my judgement of the movie.  Great job Sean, Naomi and Benicio, wish the acting had a story that interested me along with it.",21 Grams
258,spludwig26,Exceptional acting + strange approach = knock-out,10,16 January 2004,"****slight spoiler alert****21 grams is a knock-out of movie which only succeeds because of it's incredible cast. Sean Penn, who has done his best acting ever this year in both ""Mystic River"" and ""21 grams,"" heads off the amazing cast. Niaomi Watts, playing a woman who has just lost her husband and daughters, deserves an Oscar for her performance (but will probably lose to Theron for Monster). Del Toro, playing a man who believes Christ has betrayed him, is very dark and convincing.The director's (I can't pronounce his name so I'm going to avoid writing it down) approach of putting the scenes in a random order makes your head hurt a little bit. Although, the puzzle of a movie works because you understand the gist of it, which makes you able to connect it all together.I left the theater in wonderment and wondering what new things have we not done in film to make our head spin. I can't wait for another movie from this director and screenwriter. But, please, make another American film, instead of ""Amores Perros"" again.

It is starting to make sense and your interest increases.  This is the best way I can describe this unique movie ""21 Grams"".  This movie is made up of puzzle pieces of basically three separate lives which eventually come together with a tragic conclusion.

No real plot outline. I mean, if you were to put all the script on a linear judgement, you'd probably give it a 1/10. The director went all in on the fact that the movie is assembled as a puzzle, different time frames mixed into one, letting you, who watch it, to get together all the facts.

This is meant to be confusing and not to come together until near the end. You might consider renting ""Amores Perros,"" last year's movie by the same director (and writer) using roughly the same storytelling tecniques. 21 Grams, however, has a unforgiving interplay of stories to tell. This is about tragedy as in Tragedy. There is no happy ending. The acting is uniformly superb. Penn should win for this one, even if he is nominated for the other one (Mystic River).

And as much as I like the independent style of film, i found this one to be monotonous and trying too hard to be sad and an emotional downer.

I guess the story itself is not that new, but the way how it's done is simply excellent. The first, say, 30 minutes are just scraps- moments in the lives of the three main characters that mean absolutely nothing to the viewer (yet). Adding to that initial confusion is the fact that these scraps are not in temporal order so that in the beginning personally I wasn't sure I'd be able to follow- it was more like a music video that's just not making any sense at all. But then the pieces begin to come together just beautifully until in the end you can see the whole picture. Usually in these episode movies everything comes together at once somewhere in the middle of the film, but in ""21 Grams"" the viewer puts the pieces together one after another- like a jigsaw puzzle, and every bit as satisfying when everything's completed. This truly is a masterpiece script-wise, and I've never seen anything like it.That brilliant script is supported by excellent actors. Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio del Toro are delivering the most convincing acting performance I've ever witnessed. Like when Christina (Watts) screams at Paul (Penn) trying to get rid of all of her anger, frustration, grief and hate: I usually think these emotional outbursts don't seem real on screen, but in this movie it is just deeply touching. I haven't seen ""Mystic River"" yet, but if Sean Penn was as good as he is in ""21 Grams"" then the Oscar finally really went to someone who truly deserved it. And Benicio del Toro really is every inch the wonderful actor his reputation claims (I saw him for the first time but had heard a lot of him before, so I was very curious).Finally, thank you, Mr. Inárritu for putting everything together this nicely.

It's been done before more effectively; Pulp Fiction, Citizen Kane, Rashomon, Memento, the list goes on. At the beginning it's quite annoying. I'm screaming in my mind,""I just want to know what the hell is going on!!!"" Once the story progressed and I fit the pieces of the puzzle together, the characters truly began to shine. That's where this movie triumphs.Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro, and Naomi Watts all give incredible performances. Del Toro's character is one of the most complete human beings ever depicted on camera. Themes like life, death, love, god, and redemption all make their way through this film. It's good to see a movie that actually means something and has so much to say about our own lives.

269,Michaelroger,"The emperor isn't naked, rather in dirty rags",3,15 December 2003,"There are directors that say their job is to provide actors with a good script and get out of the way. I like that idea but it's tough to prove true. Here, in 21 Grams, I sensed that there was the illusion of a good script: plenty for any actor to bite and lovingly chew on and a director that surely got out of the way. I've heard him interviewed and all he seems to talk about are the myriad problems of extras or supporting players ruining scenes by being a little out of place in scenes. But that's beside the point. I don't for a minute believe that the writer wrote such a chopped up story. I don't believe that the movie we see is the script that was written. I do believe that at best 21 Grams is a mediocre cry therapy of middle aged fears as understood by a young person, not unlike the far more imaginative, amusing and humane Magnolia. I believe this half baked film was cut into shreds that were casually strung together to dress the emperor. He is not naked, only in dirty rags.I found this film to be tedious and pretensious. The on-screen wailing, while true and honest seeming, never touched my heart. In the end I wished I had tomatoes to throw at the screen.

270,Thisguy622,Acting masterclass,10,16 January 2013,"I don't know how Alejandro González Iñárritu did it but he was able to not only get one, nor two, but three great performances out of his leads. Naomi Watts, Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro are examples of how well good actors/ actresses can collaborate when they are giving the write material and the right direction. The film starts of a little confusing for the audience, not much is revealed because of the non- chronological way the story is told. For the first 20-30 minutes I found myself guessing and grasping at which event takes place when and where. However, for me at least, this made the experience even more enjoying, being able to piece these puzzle together. By the second act of the film we get a look into the character's lives, so without spoiling anything critical let me start by saying that Naomi Watts's character, Christina Peck is a woman with a troubled past involving drug addiction, married with children. Benicio Del Toro's character, Jack Jordan, is an ex-con who aims to reform himself through Jesus and God. Sean Penn's character, Paul RIvers, is a mathematician whose wife is trying to get pregnant whilst he has only a short time to live. These three entities are brought together by, as quoted in the plot summary above 'a freak/ tragic accident'.The situation's these characters are placed in are tense, to say the least, however. where the director's skill is shown is the way in which he draws away from the tension and rather focuses on the character's emotions and sometimes in the most unlikely situations, makes us feel sympathy for them. It's in those subtle, noiseless moments where the audience is really able to care for the characters. Don't get me wrong though, this film has moments were you will get edgy on your seat. This film isn't for everybody as it will be confusing at first and some people will find this off- putting. However, I urge you to watch this film, as the character's learn about their hardships we also learn more and more about the directors message. And also from a technical point of view this film isn't bad either, there are some great camera angles and some great usages of cinematography with symbolism. The sound effects during one particular scene are very notable as effective. 21 grams = 9.1/ 10",21 Grams
271,Sarie26,Extremely powerful.,9,8 March 2004,"In all honesty, I thought this was the best movie I saw this year - of course, it's just understood that this is totally a matter of opinion. I loved it. I was absolutely blown away by the riveting performances of the three lead actors: the electrifying Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts in the best performance I have ever seen from her.The story is a jumbled puzzle of events that, when put in sequence, tell the intertwining stories of three strangers who are brought together by a horrible tragedy. Naomi Watts plays Cristina Peck, mother of two young daughers who, along with the father, are struck by a car and killed. Sean Penn plays the critically ill mathematician Paul Rivers, whose recent heart transplant provides him another chance at life. Del Toro is Jack Jordan, an ex-convict who takes solace in his newfound Christian faith.In a style that is at first confusing but ultimately profound, the movie jumps back and forth between its three main characters, mixing the timeline so that sometimes we see scenes from the end of the story at the beginning of the film and etc. Also confusing, we sometimes see two characters in a scene together who, if we go by the timeline of the story, have not met yet. This can be very confusing, but in the end the movie plays like the memory of a dream, with different scenes coming in more vividly than others and seeming to haunt the viewer.All three actors are, as I have already stated, mind-blowing. I'm trying to think of the last time I saw a film in which the entire cast was so universally dynamic - honestly, there wasn't a weak link in the film, and it's what made it so good. I can't imagine how I would have received this movie without the three leads. Sean Penn should most definitely have received his Oscar nomination for this film, as his performance here far outweighs that in Mystic River. Naomi Watts is stunning and heartbreaking as a grieving, vengeful mother, and Benicio Del Toro is simultaneously tragic and frightening in his role.",21 Grams

I wanted to see everything come together even if I'd already guessed what the ordered sequence was, which by the way, I'd done for some parts but not all.The acting was great.

Sean Penn can be a great actor, but men, in this movie he makes you scream of appreciation. While the plot -in a weird circle- builds itself up, one beholds this strange stream of consciousness that is 21 grams. The structure of the narration is similar to the one seen in Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, with separate stories coming up to form a One, but this time it's outrageously magnificent the work of art that cam out of this technique.

That was then, and in our present time, the concept of a higher being is used for simply emotional and spiritual matters, rather than for scientific progression. It's not a proposition to dismiss, but something that can't be tested in ways to draw valuable conclusions. The title of 21 Grams, is based on the research of Dr. Duncan MacDougall, a twentieth century physician who tried to prove the existence of the immortal human soul. His experiments involved using patients who were on the verge of death. At the time of death, his first patient lost three fourths of an ounce, which Duncan felt was more accurate, as it accumulated to twenty one grams. The other patients had varying measurements. Skepticism was drawn as to whether his research was accurate, or in the proper direction, but aside from the measurements, 21 Grams is more of a philosophically themed film, rather than one basing its premise on a scientific hypothesis as though it were an accurate fact. It is a brilliant and captivating drama nevertheless, directed by Alejandro Gonzalez, and it examines the lives of three individuals who are all brought together by a tragedy. Very much like Innarritu's directorial debut Amores Peros, 21 Grams is told in a nonlinear narrative, with more disorientation, and with equally compelling performances that test the true potential of its lead actors, as they capture the pain and dysfunction of characters, who often crumble when faced with the notion of death, in a world where life will always be a mystery worth questioning. The film's plot centers on three characters, who are all on the verge of death. Paul (Penn) is a mathematics professor who needs a heart transplant, otherwise he'll die. Christina (Watts) is a recovering addict who is shown to be going back on drugs. And Jack (Del Toro) is an ex-con who finds solace in Christianity, regardless of how extreme a path he follows, so long as it suppresses his animalistic nature. At first each character's life seems basic and stable, given their circumstances, but as the result of a horrid car crash, a chain of events is triggered that brings all three of these characters into confronting a truth that sill baffles human beings to this very day in the focus of its acceptance. Being a recovering addict, Christina is shown at an A.A. meeting, expressing her gratitude for her two daughters and husband Michael (Huston), believing that without them, she would never have been able to conquer her addiction. Sadly that reality comes to pass as they are killed in a car accident, with Jack being the driver. As a result, Michael's death does not go to waist, as his heart is donated to Paul. Despite his fortune though, Paul feels forever changed with his new heart. He tries to brush off the feeling, and continue his life, but it initially continues to reemerge, given that he now questions his identity, which is something we constantly do within our existence. After turning himself, Jack's faith is tested, and even decimated to the point of an attempted suicide. At times, he believes he was chosen for a purpose. Other times, he curses God enough to quote the most sinister verses in the bible, and reinterpret the mind, rather than the flesh being hell. Christina on the other hand turns back to drugs, while reacting with violent aggression. Her family tries to help her cope with her loss, telling her that in the face of death, life still goes on. Christina rejects this, believing it to be nonsense, while succumbing to her own paralysis, while frequently using drugs to numb her pain even more. Paul simply follows Christina, out of a curiosity to understand who he is now, knowing that he has someone else's heart, as if that person's essence lives on inside him. When these characters do collide, then more chaos ensues, as they embark on their own paths of self-destruction. The resolutions are left with open ended conclusions, and simply the idea that regardless of how much tranquility and suffering takes place, life must go on. It is the circle of life and the face of death. It all goes in that of a cycle. But then again, 21 Grams doesn't really answer any questions. It merely supplements its ambiguity with its complex and disoriented narrative as a means of strengthening its chaotic theme. The performances by Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, and Benicio Del Toro are so dysfunctional, that to believe their suffering has an actual point would be an obtuse way of looking at the story. It seems as though Innarritu's intention is to create a film where there is no definitive answer, other than, this is how things are, and the only thing people can do, regardless of the circumstances is accept them and move forward. A film like 21 Grams does not give a more clear and concise answer. It simply plays on the mystery of the question, using the weight of the soul as one of the factors of our curiosity. Where it originates from, or where it goes after is a compelling mystery indeed, as it sums up the notion of existence to a dilemma that involves love, joy, pain, and suffering beyond comprehension. In the middle of the film, Jack's wife, played by Mellissa Leo says that, ""life goes on with or without God."" It's a sad, but true statement, and a film as depressing as 21 Grams does offer a sense of hope in this cluster of confusion, but merely within the questioning we still endow upon ourselves as we continue to seek answers and experience the sensation of life.",21 Grams
277,andreas_soerensen,"A magnificent gem of a film, which will leave you drained of emotion.",10,6 March 2004,"This is one of the most profoundly honest, real and emotional movies I have ever seen. I feel all the characters deserved oscars for their performances. The problem, of course, is that the oscars don't cater for films of this caliber and style.It doesn't have any typical film structure, such as tension build-up, which is subsequently released, or comic moments balancing out the sad parts. This movie is fully and trully based around the emotional beings of the main characters, and that's what you must expect, and judge it through. It is very hard on you if you allow yourself to be drawn in by it's haunting performances, I left the movie emotionally drained. It does not have a happy ending, and soundtrack only appears a few times. This may not be the kind of movie you allways want to see, but if you're ready for it it will reward you with an unparalleled experience, and leave you thinking about it for a long time.",21 Grams
278,Roanka,confusing,4,18 January 2004,"I usually love weird movies, but this movie isn't weird.  It is just confusing.  It took me the better part of the first half of the movie just to figure out who the characters were, what  with all their appearance changes and the time-shifting.  Even after I could identify the characters the non-linear storytelling was out of place in this movie and rather than enhance the suspense it just confused me.Additionally there are scenes in this movie that border on pornography.  The filmmakers stretch these sex scenes out for far too long and they serve no apparent purpose.Furthermore, none of the characters are sympathetic or likable.  In the end I couldn't care less whether any of the characters lived or died.I went into 21 Grams with high expectations, but this was an extremely disappointing movie.  4/10",21 Grams

This is not definitely a film to see looking for having some fun But if you are looking for great acting, try this one! Sean Penn , Benicio del Toro and Naomi Watts working well in a movie is one thing that is better not to miss. They give the necessary power to make this movie to be more than watchable in despite of all the sadness involved. And for those ( like me ) who like a story told in a not linear way, but with a lot of editing quality and interesting and satisfactory connections , this is also a must see. Enjoy it (or better saying.. suffer it!... )",21 Grams
280,cknippenberg,Melodrama about self-pity saved by good acting.,4,21 January 2004,"It was a pleasure to watch the actors and actresses perform.  Superb underrates them.  There are some very powerful emotional scenes in this movie.  The grainy presentation seems to make sure the viewer knows it's a film and keeps the film and viewer emotionally distance from each other.  It draws an emotional veil over the movie.  Try imagining them as non-grainy.The story is presented in scenes that are out of sequence, so the film seems to be presented as if we the viewing audience already know what has happened and are merely remembering it.  Because of this some of the scenes appeared overacted to me, whereas the intensity of these scenes fits perfectly in the context of the story, if it were shown sequentially.  (If you do see it, try imagining this movie as sequentially presented and compare it to any soap opera.  Without changing the sequence of how the story develops, I can see being asleep in 15 or 20 minutes.)The glue that holds this movie together for me are the superb acting for the main and supporting character roles, and 21 Grams is worth seeing for that alone.",21 Grams

Editing - backbone of the movie. the way it was presented is absolutely awesome . watching this movie is like placing many piece of puzzles in a right way. it means you have to do the editing in your mind with correct coordinates and place it in a correct order. Lead characters in this movie are look so real . they never acted in this movie, they lived in it. Once again Sean Penn ,Naomi watts stunned me with their unbelievable ,realistic acting. Benicio Del Toro resembles Brad Pitt ( may be just for my eyes). Even though it's a different presentation I see this movie as a sequel of Amores Perros(2000). because both the movies are directed by the same director and have same story impact . A 2 line story was narrated in a different manner and produced in to the screen with different way of editing and storytelling. Mind blowing movie.",21 Grams

283,gobbles_the_penguin,Masterpiece,9,18 May 2006,"21 Grams is just one of those films that you can't help but be affected by. With the power of Oscar nominated actors Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro, and a magnificent screenplay, this movie is incredibly touching. This movie proves beyond all reasonable doubt that Watts and Del Toro are a couple of the finest actors on the planet (which is only reinforced by Watts in Mulholland Drive and Del Toro in Traffic!), and they turn in their best performances so far. Sean Penn isn't so bad either, but i find it hard to associate with his character. The beauty of this film is definitely the content, which shows three characters (all linked one way or another, but anonymous before the event that links them) in complete and utter desperation. Del Toro's character looks to God in times of trouble, but is left to turn away from God because fate has gotten him into nothing but trouble. Watts is the widowed women who lost her child in the same accident that made her a widow, and Penn is in need of a heart transplant. The film is so beautifully structured, that the director can give a sneak preview of what is going to happen at the end of the film, but you still have no idea exactly how it is going to end, and you are so attached to the characters that you can't move away from the screen. The ending is beautiful, and congruent with the general aesthetic of the rest of the film.A subtle masterpiece, the kind of movie that won't always receive the big wraps, but deserves every compliment it receives.",21 Grams

Sean Penn gave an economical performance, limiting himself to two expressions, one showing how serious and miserable his character was, and the other how devastatingly attractive to women he could be. Naomi Watts was about as unsympathetic as possible as a self indulgent, drug popping white bread yupster, and her sex scenes, particularly her idea of passionate kissing, were enough to make you swear off. The only interesting characters and performances in this improbable dreary mismash, were the Jordans, played credibly by Bencio Del Toro and Melissa Leo. Look forward to seeing them again.P.S.  Greek tragedy requires a hero of great statue to bring about his own fall by virtue of a tragic flaw.",21 Grams

287,dtleonard,"Rather strange, somewhat thought provoking, but mostly unsatisfying.",5,1 February 2004,"I had to go to quite a bit of trouble to see this film, since the closest theatre showing it was 30 miles from my house. I knew a little about the film, and was anxious to see, what I expected to be, exceptional performances from the three main characters.However, I didn't really care for the film. I don't particularly care for the type of vehicle that was used to tell the story, and I didn't like the way the film looked; all grainy, but in thinking about my feelings for the movie, I realized that I just didn't really care about the characters. I wanted to care when Naomi Watt's character collapsed in the ER upon learning the fate of her family, and I wanted to care that Sean Penn's character needed a heart transplant, and I wanted to care that he finally found ""true love"", but I didn't.Of all the main characters, Benicio DelToro's reformed addict was the most convincing, but I think even his character was too sketchily drawn to draw real compassion from me. And the supporting characters were nearly cardboard characters with the exception of DelToro's children and Penn's wife's characters. His children did a good job of playing children who both love their father and at the same time are not quite sure how to react to him. Penn's wife took a small part and made me feel that she was flesh and blood, and complicated.I'm glad I saw it; these actors are great, to be sure, but this is not a movie I would particularly recommend (or the real acid test for me) want to see again.",21 Grams
288,PhilipLRuss,Why bother?,6,27 April 2004,"I came to this movie with high expectations after reading Elvis Mitchell's very positive review in the New York Times.  I was gravely disappointed.It seems the director had this idea about a triangle involving a man who accidentally kills a man and his two daughters with his truck, a second man who receives a transplant of the father's heart, and the surviving wife of the dead man.  OK, but what then?  It seems the director couldn't work out a real story, so we are given lots of time spliced scenes of these characters and their families suffering and not doing too much.  We, the audience, are kept busy trying to figure out the straight line time sequence and admiring the moody and sometimes interesting photography.  We are never made to care about any of these people.  In fact, they are so sad and dull, one just wants to get away from them.At this juncture I could not help compare this film with Mystic River, which is a great film.  Like 21 Grams, we have a seemingly chance death, the characters are related, their families are involved.  The characters are not always attractive, but we can understand why they do what they do and sympathize.  We see people taking action compelled by their up-bringings, their family circumstances, and the necessities of the situation.  It is a powerful mix of acting, directing, and writing.21 Grams has none of this.  The actors who, you can see, are trying to make something of this, have nothing to do but represent suffering while they hang out.  They have nothing to say/think thanks to the writer.  The director can't find any meaningfully motivated actions for them to perform faced with their suffering.Why bother?",21 Grams
289,sheamart,Spoof of this movie at Cinequest Online,8,8 May 2006,"There's a short film called ""21 Carbs"" and it's especially funny if you've recently watched ""21 Grams"". It's a comedy about fad diets shot in the same hand-held style with the out of order narrative, and all the characters reacting to ""an accident"" just like the ""21 Grams"" characters. It's online at: http://www.cinequestonline.org/2006/theater/detail_view.php?m=859 (If you like it, you can vote for it.) ""Grams"" certainly pushes the misery effect and doesn't let up, especially during the last half. So intense and everybody loses. Watch the spoof and you'll get a great laugh (it's a good statement on diets and body image too) and the comedy is only fueled by the misery of ""grams"".",21 Grams
290,hobbitonroad,Excellent acting Great direction,8,8 January 2004,"21 Grams is a great film. The three actors, Penn, Watts and Del Toro should get strong Academy recognition for their efforts. Ms. Watts is astonishingly great. The direction is superb, and the back and forth in time scenes seem to reflect the way people really think about things and remember. This is how the film's story unfolds, and there is no character who drops out of no where to tell us what is going on with the story. This type of acting and direction takes hard work and intelligent thinking, which is why this is such a good film. Moral and ethical dilemmas unfold too, and there are no easy answers for these characters. This film is very close to real life, and totally believable. Highly recommended for anyone with a conscience.",21 Grams

However, call me unsophisticated but the randomness of the scenes is a turn off for me. I would love to see a cut of the movie with all the scenes in chronological order. Penn, Watts, and Del Torro all are extraordinary. I just think the story could have held up on its own without the tricky flashbacks and foreshadowing. The movie has no real beginning, middle and end as you the scenes seem to be on 'shuffle' all the time. However I would recommend it to anyone that can handle something out of the ordinary with powerful acting. You really ended up caring about the characters. I give it 6 out of 10.",21 Grams
292,WordsNest,"Jagged and overrated, this alleged masterpiece was painful to watch in the worst sense of the phrase.",3,27 December 2003,"Our local paper gave this film an A+, noting it was a masterpiece that required patience and concentration, but would ultimately reward. For me, alas, it did not. I swear, I was patient. I'm quite used to films with nonlinear set ups: Memento, Betrayal, The Conversation, as well as the twining nature of most Altman films. 21 Grams was plain old annoying, although some of the actors and scenes were standouts.Ultimately, the skipping around of events was not worth the energy and challenge. Comparing the strength in performance of Sean Penn in Mystic River to the blabber of his opening and closing musings in 21 Grams leads me to be even more bewildered when he was cited for giving two remarkable portrayals. He surely deserves an Academy Award for Mystic River. In 21 Grams Penn appeared lost as an actor, not just playing a loser of a character.",21 Grams
293,bendipa,At Last Sean Penn's acting is brilliant,10,19 November 2007,"I have to admit I haven't been the greatest fan of Sean Penn. Much of the time he appears to overact, or he seems to be pretty well typecast as an unsavoury character. Dead Man Walking and more recently Mystic River are 2 examples where his acting felt OTT and unconvincing.But 21 Grams is the first film I've seen of his where his acting skills really hit the right notes big time. Because Penn has the central role, and that the subject matter dealt within the film is sensitive as well as emotional, it was vital that Penn could nail the role of Paul Rivers with conviction to make the film succeed, and thankfully this time he comes up trumps and I ended up feeling considerable sympathy towards his character. The whole cast contribute strongly, especially Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro, the other 2 main actors.It's also refreshing to watch a film that can succeed on a downbeat dramatic level without resorting to excessive violence, car chase sequences and the usual clichés that so many Hollywood films feel the need to rely on these days. A good storyline and great acting will always win through in appreciation over time if not necessarily the box office.Highly recommended.",21 Grams
294,tayman104,Very Unique,8,18 December 2005,"21 grams was one of the first movies I've seen filmed in such a fashion. The entirety of the film was shot in quick scenes and fragments which gave intimations of what you could expect later, or foreshadowed things to come.Naomi Watts, Sean Penn, and Benicio del Toro all gave solid performances. In my opinion this was Benicio del Toro's finest acting role he's ever done, playing a Christian who left his old life of crime and drugs. Sean Penn rivaled performances he has done in films such as Mystic River. Naomi Watts is just about good in everything, she doesn't let you down in this film either.What makes this film even more interesting is that it was based upon real actual events that took place. This movie is extremely good.Bottom line: If you hate movies that jump around a lot and aren't as linear as normal films, you might not like this one. But rest assured it all ties up in the end. 8/10-Tayman",21 Grams
295,jackalchow,life is assessed in quantity,8,29 August 2007,"In common feeling, heavier weight is equal to more power,useful being. It reflects on Newton's law, force is directly proportional to the mass. It seems that low weighed substance is being ignored.""How does the life weigh?"" 21 gram is a negligible weight?However,the story pointed out that human being just lose 21g in the process from birth to death. It indicates that the life is so small and weak according the meaning in 1st paragraph.Somethings in the world can't be measured, it is surprising that once to be quantized, life can be so invaluable in the view of some people. Even though most of us regards life has no replacement by any other things.It is ridiculous but reflect the truth. The 3 mains characters in the story:Paul, Christina and Jack, processing the cycle of the destiny, just like a joke: Paul got the heart disease again even got a new one;Chisitina lost her new love(Paul) after his husband dead; Jack still face the fate of jail, and to be a criminal again. All of their results are the same. The rule of Cause and Effect totally show on the screen, no one can change the fixed result, no matter how hard they try, the expression of Nihilism.The only difference is the process after their trying to challenge the God. For instance, Paul reveal the new meaning of love, by taking the action of revenge and self-sacrificed. Is it enhance his pain in the survival pathway?Or making his life more meaningful, rather than doing nothing as a fresh paper? Except for himself, no one can comment on this.About the narration, the director also tried to minimize the influence of cause and consequence.The timing barrier is broke by such narration. When the audience watch the scene that Paul stayed in the hospital and waiting for death, the illusion has been made that he can't got a donated heart for transfer. Who can suppose that he finally waited for the hope but drop afterward due to the repulsion of his body? The fate is the same, it may be the life.......",21 Grams
296,agaluro,personal tragedy and car crashing obsession,3,4 November 2003,"This movie is a way for Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu of doing catharsis for their own sorrow lived years ago when he suffered the lost of a family member. He explored the grieving and lightness means of life through not only the three principal characters but the people surrounding them. But besides the the plot that has a strong moral message, the thing that rescues the movie is the way it was edited to unwrap and to tease simultaneously three stories. Sadly again, the director used the devise of a car crash to tie the lives of three characters as he did it in Amores Perros. Time to try something else, please.

298,ereg24,I did not like it... I REALLY did not like it,3,21 May 2007,"Let me start by saying I did not like this movie, I realize that I weakens my credibility to the subject, and those of you that have committed some emotional investment into it probably are probably going to dismiss every thing negative I'm going to say well IMDb has never been a place for intelligent discussion.I saw this movie when if first came into the rental shacks of Florida. Having heard nothing but rave revues I was elated to see it. I was 4 years younger then and found it boring. Four years latter and four years wiser I watched it again after hearing a lot of people say how great that 21 grams movie was. Needless to say I still wasn't impressed.My biggest problem with the movie is the story. Stylistically I find the novelty of out of order sequences fun, and it's nice to piece them together, but there is a problem when the end result to your puzzle is a lack luster picture. The story is not that good (and don't give me that ""you just don't/aren't smart enough to get it"" crap, because I get it, there's just not much to get) the cinematography is good, excellent even, kudos to the director, but if the best painter (in reference to actual painting talent) paints a picture of excrement, you are still looking at a picture of excrement.The next issue I have with this movie is the acting; Sean Penn is not good in this movie. I realize this actor has a little cult that loves him in everything he touches (which might be why some like the film) but the man is not a good actor. Penn's acting in this film is wooden, emotionless, forced and drains the soul from all who hear it. It is almost as if he was pumped with tranquilizers before each take. But I digressI think the reason this movie has the rank it does, (an undeservingly high one in my opinion) is because it tries so hard do be deep. In reality the movie offers dime store philosophy with an interesting presentation, but as I said before, just because the presentation is good, doesn't make the film good. I think the people who defend this movie as art do so because they eitherA: don't know better movies out there that do the exact same thing more effectively.B: have seen this as there first ""deep"" movie and hold some emotional investment to it. C: really REALLY love the works of Sean Penn.D: are faux intellectuals elitist that love to place themselves on planes higher then other people, and see this boring, trite, and altogether bad movie as something they can pass off as artsy brilliance to people who don't like it/haven't seen it. They then rap themselves into excuses that the movie is good, and Sean Penn is a great actor in it, and the shallow puddle of a story means so much more then it really does etc, to the point ware they become blind to trash when they see it.",21 Grams
299,sheycavin,If you like Traffic....,10,28 November 2004,"This is a very intelligent movie. There's no way a studio could open this film on 2,000 screens on Memorial Day weekend and expect to rake in $50 million. It's just not that kind of movie. But having said that, I'm very grateful to the makers of this film. My chest tightened, my lips smiled, and my eyes watered throughout. In other words: it was moving. Without getting into the ""it's sucks"" vs. ""it's great"" debate, I'll just say that movies, like every other product, are made for target audiences. Some are refined to a very small target, some are refined to a very large target. I'd say 21 Grams had a pretty small target. A short list of films to compare would be: Monster's Ball, Taxi Driver, Traffic, and Momento. If you enjoy these, then 21 Grams will appeal to you, more than likely. I'm quite sure there are people like me out there who will fall within the target and be blown away by it, but I can't promise it's you. I don't even know you! :-) My only complaint about the film would be the same complaint I have about every film I've seen in the last seven years: it's too long. I'd guess that's a result of supply and demand. Good directors are in short supply and high demand, so their value (power) is way up. Most directors hate leaving scenes in the cutting room so less is getting left out these days. Overall, 21 Grams gets 9/10 from me.",21 Grams
300,Aloft,The weight of a moment.,9,29 November 2003,"Told in an ever increasing pile of fragments and chronologies, the message of this film is how the weight of moments resounds out and around in our lives, and the lives of those touching ours. Thus, instead of building characters and story arcs, as we've grown to expect from the tellers of stories for centuries now, this film focuses entirely upon the actions of the involved people, and the consequences of those actions.The fragments are from all over the story. Some are fairly long, others are faint and short, more like the small types of things a lover might remember about their past. Indeed, much of the movie feels as if you, an outsider to these involved people, have been granted the ability to hear all of their thoughts and cries. As if this moment has been transposed upon you, each fragment of that moment screaming to the surface, jostling those around it for your attentions. Only towards the latter half does a degree of linearity form, but never to the point where you lose this sense of being the ultimate observer to an unfolding cacaphony.Another interesting effect this accomplishes is that it never grants you any moments of catharsis. Instead, the relaxation is embedded within the grief of these characters; each existing simultaneously, almost throughout the entire duration of the film. This is not a movie where you cry once, twice, or even a few times -- but a movie where the tears are lurking behind every scene, spilling out when you least expect it, when you've been caught blindsided by another facet of the story. Yet, it does this without ever once feeling manipulative, or contrived.As I walked the grey streets after seeing this movie, relishing the fading memories, the single, simple, haunting score stayed with me until hours later. I had touched upon a Moment in the lives of these people. And while the people were not terribly important to me, they are only fictitious characters in a movie after all, it was the weight of their presence, the weight of the mirror they cast into the lives of us all that sparked within me a reverence of tragedy. Was it heavier than this movie, or lighter than that one? I don't know, but 21 Grams seems just about right.",21 Grams
301,eth78-623-599166,An Incredible Combination,10,25 May 2012,"I may have never seen a more impressive core acting ensemble than I witnessed in this movie. 21 Grams is a project that is utterly blessed; Guillermo Arriaga's outstanding script and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's powerful direction aside, the trio of lead actors does what they must do: they draw us in, they keep us in, and they give us no choice but to feel complete and total empathy with the calamity that their respective characters are going through. Naomi Watts, Sean Penn, and Benicio del Toro give the performances of their careers, forcing us to experience their pain, their grief, their hope, and their love. The non-sequential storytelling makes the plot all the more intriguing; we get plenty of foreshadowing, which adds to the story and enhances the lead-up to the climax tenfold. See 21 Grams; I defy you to not be completely absorbed by an amazing tale of three people in individual and collective upheaval.",21 Grams
302,mrpink000,"An extremely powerful, dark and heavy drama - originally put together and quite brilliantly acted",7,23 January 2004,"21 Grams is the second film by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, the director behind the brilliant 2001 Mexican film, Amores Perros.In his second feature, he keeps the same style of a fragmented narrative style and the same themes, which are mainly death, tragedy and the importance of relationships. 21 Grams is a heavy and dark drama which follows the lives of 3 characters. Paul Rivers (Sean Penn); a college Maths professor who lives with his girlfriend and suffers from a rare and serious heart condition. Christina Peck (Naomi Watts); a loving wife and caring mother of two, maturing as a young adult after a reckless youth with the help of her family. And Jack Jordan (Bencio Del Toro); an ex-con who has devoted his life to his faith, finds it hard to remain in the same job, a husband and a father of two.These three different characters lives are entwined when a tragic and fatal car crash significantly effects each in way one or another.
21 Grams is an emotionally draining and at times depressing film and is definatley not for the faint hearted. The fragmented narrative style is at times confusing for the audience but also intriguing, always making the viewer think.The performances from Penn, Del Toro and in particular Noami Watts are quite outstanding. We probably wont see any other film this year which offers such amazing acting by three actors in the one film. A solid and very originally made film - 7/10",21 Grams
303,fivedimensionalmanifold,Intense character study,8,10 July 2005,"I found this movie very moving and very well written. The performances are almost all great, especially the leads. Several disturbing scenes are shown without being ""milked"" too much for their gut wrenching impact. This keeps the movie from playing out like an episode of CSI or Cold Case. I generally am a sucker for movies with non-linear exposition, and this one sure has it. It would be interesting to hear if Tarantino has seen this, and if so whether he felt that the non-linear exposition worked or not. As I said, the lead actors all give excellent performances. Penn is great, playing another introverted, restless, and ultimately well-meaning guy. Naomi Watts does a brilliant job playing a widow who lost not only her husband but also her children, and who struggles to maintain a normal lifestyle. Benicio Del Toro's character is trying to lead an upright life but seems to be in recovery from alcoholism and possibly other personal problems. I enjoyed watching the interactions between Del Toro and the other members of his born-again religious group, because usually born-again Christians are depicted as completely nutty in movies, and here they were shown to be mostly earnest. The minister or priest seemed to be trying very hard to encourage Benicio Del Toro to live life the right way, but he still finds himself struggling to maintain his job and family life during the movie. The separate narrative threads eventually all intersect and it manages to work without seeming overly showy or aesthetic. That is to say, I was still very involved in the storyline even as the characters come together and the narrative threads interweave. The director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, is quickly becoming one of the most mentioned names in drama, and he will most likely provide his audiences with some other interesting work in years to come. I've also seen Amores Perros, which I thought was pretty good too. 21 Grams seems a little more daring in my opinion, so I think of it as the better movie. Overall, it was an extremely provocative film with some great and nuanced performances.",21 Grams
304,thegouch23,Putting the Pieces Together,9,4 November 2004,"A movie directed in inimitable style, Inarritu's 21 Grams is a provocative, deeply moving filmic work that explores several fundamental questions: What is a life, what is its value, and can we place a value on it? Directed in a series of small, seemingly disconnected fragments that come together as the film progresses, the film is thus shot in a style deeply unfamiliar to American moviegoers. At the beginning, most American viewers will find the choppy, nonlinear timeline distracting and frustrating - a cinematic form of coitus interruptus where once on the verge of revealing an underlying plot concept, the fragment abruptly stops and is picked up at an unrelated point. This style continues throughout, but don't worry. The answers do come after a while.It is worth noting that the actual storyline, when told linearly, is not as gripping as when told in this style. The linear form would resemble a typical mindless story of the wounded seeking revenge. The way Inarritu constructs the story allows him to give the viewer a sense of where various characters are at the same time without the appearance of repetition. It allows moviegoers to see actual events first, then form associations later. There is a sense of, ""Oh, now I get it!"" that would be conspicuously absent if 21 Grams were told linearly.Moving on, the performances of the actors and actresses in the film are incredible. All are believable. The animalistic hatred of Christina Peck (Naomi Watts) for Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro), the deeply troubled father who regrets his big mistake and has become a born again Christian, is palpable throughout. Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is genuine in his efforts to repay, literally, a life debt. The performances breathe further life into the series of events that 21 Grams attempts to chronicle.By the film's ending, the entire tale of what has transpired is revealed to the viewer. Since key plot elements often appear in several of the disconnected sequences, they come to be points of reference that astute moviegoers can use to sort the rest of the plot. By the end, everything is complete. The title is finally put into context, and the attempt to answer the three previously mentioned fundamental questions is made. Yes, at the beginning, this movie may not seem to make much sense, and it may even be frustrating to watch. Still, resist the temptation to get up and leave the theater. Stick around and watch the whole thing. The pieces do ultimately fall into place. I promise. And besides, there's only one way to find out.",21 Grams

If you watch carefully this movie, you see it's just your average soap-opera but the writer decided to cover up the over-dramatized thin story by mixing all the scenes in a random order, only the end was put on its classical place.The cast : I think Sean Penn is much better on a director's chair (except his role in Woody Allen's ""sweet and lowdown""),Benicio Del Torro didn't convinced me as well and Naomi Watts ... no really... i had the feeling the director was waving with a academy award behind the camera.Is bringing together random characters by unfortunate events becoming a new genre ?

306,vadim_k,"A great, great story..",10,5 September 2014,"A great, great story.. to me, as a Christian, it speaks volumes of my own struggle, but what an amazing abstraction that brings in so many different dimensions, ways of reading and associating with the heroes - a true story of redemption, of finding a proper time and place to die.. to be born! I am sure everyone will find in this movie a character to associate with, to share fears and doubts. Amazing thing is that doesn't matter how weak or wrong people are everyone finds their strength, although maybe not in the way they might have expected. Movie wonderfully reminds how fragile our lives are, how wrong we may be.. and very convincingly, not in a moralistic, forceful manner, it shows that despite this rather hopeless and desperate situation there is hope, there is beauty and meaning - there is life.",21 Grams
307,Neil_McCauley1,So much to think about....A truly brilliant film!,10,15 February 2007,"21 Grams was a very emotional ride for me, as I expect it was for all viewers. The film brings to life the struggles that exist in all people. The things that happen in life bring people together and push others apart. When tragedy strikes, all people cope in different ways. The three characters, all fabulously portrayed by Penn, Watts, and Del Toro gave me the stark realization that life weighs a lot. Life weighs more than any of us can imagine, and it is something that some people take for granted. The relationships people develop for different reasons have meaning, and all actions and decisions have purposes, regardless of when or how they are made. Upon reflection, this film represents the idea that no matter how deep into a downward spiral someone may be, there is always hope at the end. There is light at the end of the tunnel. For Cristina and Jack, they received the light in the form of Paul's death. It gave them each hope that they could turn their lives around, for Paul and for themselves. How much can fit into 21 grams? Well, this film showed that a lot can fit. Two lives can fit. That is clear. Cristina and Jack's lives fit into those 21 grams that Paul let go of when he died. It is up to them to carry Paul's 21 grams with them, and to never forget what happened to them. The film showed me that life can go on even after brutal tragedy. Cristina was able to move on and raise her new child. Jack was able to come to grips with Paul's death and the accident he was responsible for. By receiving forgiveness from Cristina, the burden was lifted and he was able to resume his family life. This film featured some of the most powerful scenes I have ever watched, and the way the puzzle unraveled was an amazing experience to watch unfold. Paul's death gave 21 grams to both Cristina and Jack. His death gave them life. The film is bleak, but it shows that hope exists in the world. Even when events transpire that leave people in the dark, somebody or something will come along to turn that light back on. That light was Paul's death. The thing is, though, that we have to hold on to the idea that the light is coming. If we let the darkness consume us, we will never know what would happen the next day. That is why I think suicide is so tragic, because those people never knew what was ahead of them. What was going to happen that next day? We must keep on living, if only for the idea that things will change. This film offered a tremendous amount of depth, and it is hard to digest everything it presented. It will take several viewings for me to fully appreciate it I think. I want to re-emphasize the point that, to me, this movie showed that life weighs a lot. Life is precious. We have to cherish every moment we spend alive, because things can change in an instant. The three characters all faced adversity, tragedy, and despair, but they all ended up with new perspectives on the lives they led, and for two of them, the lives they will lead in the future. This is one of the most meaningful films I have ever seen. It has given me much to think about. It has become an instant favorite of mine.I give this film a very enthusiastic 10/10. I look forward to seeing some of Inarritu's other work as well. Penn, Watts, and Del Toro each put forth their brightest performances in my view.",21 Grams
308,jgstclair,Deep subject,10,26 May 2015,"Gave this 10 stars because it's such an involved subject. Sean Penn is fantastic, and Naomi Watts is one of my favorite actors now because of her chilling delivery here. She is raw, unbalanced, everything you'd expect from a woman who lost everything. Benicio del Toro is amazing -don't think I've ever seen him in a bad movie. An excellent actor & here he is as human as one can get. The woman who plays his wife is such an interesting counterpoint to his moral character and she, too, is excellent in her portrayal. The subject/theme is probably one most of us have never considered -is it possible for us to receive a part of another human's life force when we have a body part transplanted into us? Deep subject. Also deals with human emotions on a level that I found completely engrossing. It's three stories in one, all threads being tied together by the end of the film. The kind of film where I'd like to shake the hands of the producers, directors, and actors for rendering such a fine cinematic piece.",21 Grams
309,smurf-6,Major Disappointment...,1,28 March 2004,"MILD SPOILERSSorry, but I don't get it.  The film was all over the place.  You really had to concentrate to have any clue as to what was going on.  People keep mentioning Memento, but I thought Memento was 1000 times better.  Half the time I was trying to figure out if the scene we were watching was in the past or in the present.I couldn't help feeling that all the jumble of time cutting and editing was really just gimmickry. Totally different from Memento where the the approach was genuinely clever and integral to the plot.And a lot of padding in this film - no need at all for Sean Penn's relationship with the dark haired woman who wanted a child. This must have taken up about half an hour for no reason.  Sometimes I found myself spinning my finger trying to get the scenes to happen faster.There a huge number of things about the movie that were totally unrealistic. Naomi isn't going to be ""alone"" after such a devastating loss.  Family would be there.  The change in her persona was WAY TOO DRAMATIC.  I just couldn't believe it.  I won't press charges  KILL HIM!  Do you really think she'd go from Soccer Mom to drug user to sleeping with a practical stranger?Naomi Watts was the best thing about this movie but overall it was very disappointing and unrealistic.  Hollywood's has one wierd view of the world.",21 Grams
310,Dick-114,More seriousness and fine filmmaking but less profundity than meets the eye.,9,2 January 2004,"The final question asked isn't what's lost (21 grams, yeah sure) but what's gained -- presumably by a lifetime of living and muddling through moral issues of guilt, conscience, revenge, self-justification, hatred, evasion, you name it -- given accidents that happen and the inappropriateness of virtually any response to those accidents, instinctive or deliberated, violent or forgiving.  ""Life goes on"" and the characters -- if they survive -- bear up (and the women bear the next generation if they can).  If not for the disjunctive time frame this would be a straightforward gimmicky though heavy melodrama (heart recipient seeks to avenge donor's wife's loss and muddles his own moral rectitude all the more), a ""fatal and bloody mischancing of events"" as Wm. Faulkner put it.  I recall Faulkner also used disjunctive time frames to disengage the audience from a sense of fatality, affirming that we each make and endure our own lives as best we can.I like the hard lighting and grainy texture, an unpretty world filled with unpretty people trying to be better than that and sometimes by grace and luck managing it.",21 Grams
311,eddyx77,Less could have been more...,7,4 December 2003,"21 Grams is the new film from the director of ""Amorres Perros"", and its got some of the best acting I've seen in a long time, especially from Naomi Watts, who is making it rapidly apparent that she's an amazingly talented actress.  The film uses the same time shuffling storytelling that was in ""Amorres Perros"", but this time the film is edited so that it jumps around very rapidly, often times from scenes that are 30 seconds long or less. The film is based primarily on character-development surrounding several climactic events, and the viewer can piece more and more of the whole story together as the film goes on.  The problem is that the film, which clocks in at over 2 hours, ends up showing us too much of what we've already figured out, and as a result the emotional impact of the film is mitigated.  In a film like this, with such interesting characters and talented actors, the editor should have held to the adage that ""less is more"", giving the audience just enough to make sense of everything but still keep an air of mystery around the lives of the three main characters.  Instead, there are countless scenes that feel like they are treading water, filling in small gaps in the story that the audience already has a grasp on.  I would still recommend this movie based on the brilliant performances, but unfortunately it can't hold up against ""Amorres Perros"" because it gives away a little too much.  7 out of 10.",21 Grams
312,wjbates3,A powerful piece of cinema!!!!!,8,13 February 2007,"Wow were to start, I have just watched 21 Grams for the 3rd time and I am still blown away by the whole film. The script is fantastic but the way Inarritu has put on the screen is magnificent, the cinematography is beautiful ans ugly as is the editing and characters, the steady cam that gives realism and grit. I found it to be a film of questions, what can you fit into 21 grams? Thats the first but also the question of loosing 21 grams when we die. In this film Penn dies, again and again, Watts dies again and again, Del Toro dies again and again. The raw emotion in this film is one of it's true triumphs, not in recent times have I felt emotional ripped apart as I did after watching this film. The editing was a major player in this, we knew what had happened for over half the film, we even nearly new the ending, but all we are given is little shots. This kept us imagining the crash, the gun shots, and nothing is more powerful than our own imagination and Inarritu uses this brilliantly, even when the crash happens we are left to stir in our own minds as the leaf blower is relentless, just as the film. I am in awe.",21 Grams
313,minataur,What's All the Fuss?,4,21 March 2004,"Someone please tell me what all the talk is about this movie.  OK, let's say the acting is good, I guess, the plot line weaves in and out of everyone's lives that for the longest time you're not sure who knows who, who is living with whom, what the point of this exercise is futility is and who really gives a diddly-squat about any of the characters, their experiences, their lives, their emotions, their problems or their addictions.  It is without a doubt a waste of some very talented actors and the editor must have been on some type of drugs when the movie was being edited.  Are the performances really Oscar worthy, not really, but then I never believed that Halle Berry deserved a nomination for Monster's Ball, and she won, I guess if you take your clothes off now-a-day it qualifies as an Oscar worthy performance.",21 Grams

This is a facile recipe for  'powerful' movies--throw in as many melodramatic elements and situations and scenes as possible, some decent actors, rip Dostoyevsky off for bonus points, and, voila, you  have a 'powerful drama', of  the Hollywood kind. Sean Penn is decent for once. DelTorro is pretty good as the Dostoyevskian criminal tortured by his sins. I've always liked Naomi Watts, and it was very nice to see her semi-naked.So: OK movie, but too blatantly and cheaply manipulative of the viewer's emotions to be really good.",21 Grams
316,Evil_Bob,Destined to become a classic but overrated,7,24 February 2004,"At the time that i am writing this the film has yet to be released where i am from. I saw it last week at the Dublin film festival. i went along because i had heard good reviews and I like all the actors involved. I don't recall being so disappointed before. I don't think its a spoiler by telling you this but the film is one of those films that start showing you the end and then cut back to begin the story and then cut to the end again. This process has irritated me for quite a while because its generally unnecessary (fight club is a good example of how it works, this and house of sand and fog are bad examples). There really was little point in putting the majority of this story out of linear order. By showing us how the film is going to end we know in advance that certain things cannot happen to the characters because we know that they have to survive to reach that point in the film.Therefore all tension is gone. Had this film been in linear order it would have made it better, We would have seen the natural development of the characters and the ending would have been genuinely shocking. The fact is the film is just a bit boring and a little overlong. Great performances all round though. And by the way the title and the tag line. The relevance please???",21 Grams
317,sjeannep,"Revenge, Grief, and Christianity",7,22 March 2006,"The critics loved this non-linear, realistic film about the convergence of three lives due to a tragic accident. The non-linear format contributes greatly to the suspense and mystery of this heavy drama, unfortunately it also causes it to drag. There are some very impressive performances by Sean Penn, Benecio Del Toro and Naomi Watts that make this ambitious effort worth watching. The themes are compelling; however, in the end, the director ultimately missed an opportunity to actually make a statement about true Christianity, revenge and grief. In a way, the title is similarly failing. I knew what 21 grams referred to before I saw it, but the more I heard the title ""21 Grams,"" the more meaningless it became. I kept having to remind myself that it doesn't refer to drugs.",21 Grams

This movie just goes on to show how everything we do is SO interconnected...and then makes us realize that even the smallest of actions are of significance, if not to us, then to someone else...kinda like the 'butterfly effect' theory It also portrays what happens when we take something as critical as religion to an extreme...

319,david_griffith,Too clever by half!,5,10 December 2003,"Constructed in a reverse mosaic of scenes in a manner similar to ""Memento"", ""Irreversible"" and (the best of them all) ""Bad Timing a Sensual Obsession"", the rather pretentiously titled ""21 grams"" is gritty and hard-hitting movie with some excellent acting performances but an empty heart. What the movie does well is to show the extreme intellectual, educational and moral poverty to be found in many parts of the United States. It also gives the viewer an intense bodyshock as the filmmakers take us on a 'Caravan of Pain' through humiliating situations and a gruesome sequence of events both seen and implied (car crash, abortion, fertility treatment, transplant operation, self-mutilation, gun-crime, child abuse, drugs, family violence, etc., etc.). Unfortunately, the visceral power of individual scenes is not matched by credible plotting (twisted heart transplant man becomes obsessed with widow of his donor and together they decide to murder the loser driver). The result is an increasingly offensive and 'pronographic' clash between gritty realist style and melodramatic plot that ultimately belittles its subject matter and undermines the audience's genuine emotional responses to horrific situations. Too clever by half!",21 Grams
320,El_General,One Beautiful Puzzle,9,3 January 2004,"Independent films are rarely ever shown in my area of the world, but when one decides to the pop its sweet low-budget, grinding face into my home, I'm going to greet it with as much respect and loving as any family member. Such is the case of 21 Grams, a twisting and unnerving look at the effects of death on human beings.  Three people, through coincidences I shall not reveal, conflict and react to various degrees of death or closeness to death.  What the movie says about religion is not seen on the surface, but if one decides to dig deep enough, a religious message can be seen. Paradoxically, the movie fails when it decides to send this message.  21 Grams director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, shows off his visual skills, shattering the whole linear plot into shards of time and jumbling them through a two hour jaunt.  This effect is what keeps the movie interesting. Put end to end, the plot of the movie isn't anything special, and the lunge for art would seem even worse had it been set end to end.  However, Inarritu shows such zest for the jumbling time.  His ability to keep the audience interested in this movie is the salvation of the film itself.  Given this, if the movie wasn't time-contorting, I still would have paid my money to see this movie because of the acting.  Naomi Watts is harrowing as Cristina Peck, a mother who experiences death in her family.  Her crying spells, combined with drug and alcohol abuse, create such a wrecked character that one wonders how she can be saved at all.  Such a wreck she is, and yet Naomi portrays her with such realism and emotion that it may bring a tear to your eye.  Although Naomi is fantastic, I think the star of the show is Benicio Del Toro as Jack Jordan, an ex-con who seems to have been given salvation by Jesus Himself.  Jack tries to live an ordinary life, but the past haunts him.  Through a disturbing event, his life is tossed upside down and his faith is tested.  Just like in Traffic, Del Toro gives a quiet but haunting performance.  One can just see the internal agony of such a character, and just like Traffic, one doesn't know whether Del Toro will end up good or bad.  In terms of pure haunting effect, Del Toro can make your heart skip a beat with just a glance or a moment of silence.  That's a true actor.  The other actor in this movie who has been given praise is Sean Penn as Paul Rivers, a Math Professor who needs a heart transplant.  In Mystic River, Sean Penn's harrowing stares gave his performance life and gusto.  In his role here, however, he has nothing much to do but make the audience feel sorry for him and for his instances.  He's a man that can't let go of his habits or of his way of looking at life.  Although a central character in the movie, Penn seems to playing the twin of his character in Mystic River, and frankly it's not entirely believable.  In a mediocre year in acting performances, this one might stand out.  His ""nothing special"" attitude towards his character, along with the straightforward storyline, may be the only flaws in an otherwise flawless movie about the flaws of human beings in the face of great peril.",21 Grams

The writing was superb with all of the twists of fate and sheer coincidence. The directing was very good especially with his vision of how he wanted the story to be told through flash backs from the climax of the film then back to earlier in the story and so forth. It was a unique way to put a movie together and it worked. Then there was the acting, which was outstanding. After watching the performance of Sean Penn I can understand why he is one of the top male actors of the day. He brings so much to the role, you feel the pain that his character is feeling. Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts were both well deserving of their Oscar nods. The one thing that I felt was over done, however, was the sex scene. I felt that it was over the top. I feel that there has to be a limit even when the director is reaching for realism. I like a movie to be realistic but the audience should still be allowed to rely on his or hers own imagination.

Its almost like this movie wants to be like pulp fiction what with the random people being involved in one another's life and the non linear presentation, but fails incomprehensibly. wait, thats an understatement. this movie is more like the aftermath of a nuclear explosion.its too bad because the movie dealt with some powerful situations. you have a wife who just lost her husband and children in one incident, basically ruining her life. you have a born again Christian who isn't the most decent guy around who accidentally kills said husband and children. then you have a guy who's heart is failing and receives a brand new working heart from said dead husband, and falls in love with his savior's widow. but like i said, any potential this movie had (if it had any) was nuked by the totally randomized presentation. its as if the director closed his eyes, pinned the scenes on the wall, spun around 10 times, and threw darts at the wall determining the scene sequence.towards the end of the movie, i didn't care anymore what happened to anybody, i could have cared less if a giant meteor struck the earth and destroyed it. and i laughed at the pathetic narration at the end of the movie trying to make sense of the abomination i had just watched. i would have found greater entertainment in staring at a blank wall for 2 hours.remove this movie from the top 250. immediately",21 Grams

328,ssfandad,Powerful Drama,9,1 March 2004,"I am not sure what people mean by this being too melodramatic, but the three main characters are strong and convincing in this brooding and intense drama.  I really felt like you were able to get inside the characters, and the non-linear storyline really added to the suspense and drama despite much of the conclusion being foregone.  I thought de Toro was magnificent.The treatment of death was also very thought provoking, with several different angles being explored through the accident and the illness. There was also some exploration of the relationship between parents and children, abortion and loss.I recommend it, though I thought the sex scene was unnecessary.",21 Grams

It seems to be working.4/10",21 Grams
330,agharwaen,21 grams: the weight of reality,10,4 February 2004,"21 grams is a film that makes people to think... for more than you try to be out of it, you finish involved in the tram.  After you see it, you get the reality impression of it, here and now.  It is a film that must be seen more than one time, is impossible to catch all the aspects of the film in its nervous edition, that by the way deserves an Oscar.The tram is so real that it gave me the will to vomit in the hour that I got out the cinema... you know (urgh.. my heart... - to understand this, go see it).  Tragic things that don't stop to happen... and that simply nobody is guilty and you can't stop the events.  The script also would have to take an Oscar (written by Guillermo Arriaga).  I feel for The Lord of the Rings, but although Peter Jackson have done the last one of its trilogy, his best one... you can't compare... and I discover that 21 grams are superior in diverse aspects.Clearly that it doesn't have complex special effects, but is a more involving film, deeper.  The sound of the shots, in the cinemas is heard for the first time as a high and dry, metallic shot, real and mortal.... Point for the director Iñárritu.  Well it's a good movie... is a typical kind of film from outside Hollywood, that has a strong central line and new type to face the pictures and frames (rare thing in Hollywood, where everything isrighty...).  The celluloid gives an impression of real film... it isn't a false cinematography.  10 of 10... many has filmed before with this kind of subject, but this one is amazing.",21 Grams
331,braulioramirez90,Naomi Watts might just have lost 21g. for her performance!,8,26 June 2006,"Alejandro González Iñárritu gives his best into this compelling, real story of three misfits in some very deep trouble. The audience gets three genuine, insightful performances from Sean Penn, Benicio del Toro, and Naomi Watts. Sean Penn's portrayal (I think) is far greater than his portrayal in 'Mystic River'. Benicio del Toro's acting is very exact, keeping it at the right level, so he doesn't overdo it. Naomi Watts...Wow!...I left a whole paragraph for her. What an actress. I've never seen her before this film, and I have to say she immediately became my favorite actress of all time. She was born to be one. She is very consistent in her role, making her very professional. She gives every emotion coming from a grieving mother/wife. You can't just resist from shedding at least one tear for her throughout the film. The work is all her; Not the screenplay's, not the director's, but all hers. She is at the top of her game. I'm not an Oscar judge, but I'll say, she just as rightfully deserved the Oscar as Charlize Theron. They should have at least, in the bare minimum, have given a tie, giving them both Oscars. I think what really robbed her from it was the way the film was presented, I mean the sequence. She's cut in scenes, limiting her performance. And, she got no make-up (at least not compared to Charlize Theron) so... She, without a doubt, is about to beat every single actress out there. About the plot: I would have given it 9 stars because it is not chronologically in order. I'm still giving it a ten. This is a masterpiece!",21 Grams
332,bessey,"Gritty, Stylish, and Mezmerizing",10,2 October 2006,"What an awesome puzzle. From the first scene it sucks you in. The Performances from Naomi Watts, Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and all the other people were so realistic and true. It's a shame that movies now can't reflect on this film as a work of art like the Sistine Chapel. To me this movie deserved more Oscars than just two. The were Christina (Watts) learns that her children are dead is so powerful and realistic that the Academy should have given her the Best Actress award without and deliberation. Can any other actress have played the role as well as she did? I think not, Naomi Watts was born to play roles like these that are dramatic and gritty with softness around the edges. I loved this film and it is hands down one of the best movies ever made in the history of movie making",21 Grams
333,mike62481,Great character film,9,23 March 2004,"This is a very realistic film about human beings and their ability to handle difficult life-altering situations.  It is a great character film.  The 3 major characters are brilliantly portrayed.  I like the director's decision to have this film in non-chronological order.  It adds to the dimension of understanding each character.  The story revolves around a car accident which alters the life of 3 characters:  the man (Benicio Del Toro) who hits the pedestrians, the woman (Naomi Watts) who loses her husband and 2 daughters, and the man (Sean Penn) who receives a heart from the dead husband. It is beautifully done:  the dialogue, the acting, the filming, everything is superb.Just like Amores Perros they all are connected through a car accident. It is much more captivating than Amores Perros though, with the same storyline, and same type of chronological shifting.  It is also realistic in the sense that very little music is used at intense dramatic moments where one would think music would be necessary.  It has the reverse effect though. No sound is as dramatic and powerful as sound at times.
Del Toro and Sean Penn are as good as it gets as two men battling inner demons .  Naomi Watts is almost as good as she is in Mulholland Drive (she is just more incredible in Mulholland Drive).  Watts turns to drinking and then drugs after death of her husband and two daughters.  She is in a downward spiral.  Del Toro's character continually raises the ultimate question about whether God is the cause of things and has an ultimate plan for everyone?? 3 great character actors with 3 great written characters.  The director has gone into a different and altogether more effective direction with his use of music.  The shots of the film are pieced together but pieced together in a realist way.  Faded blurry shots, use of light is sometimes all encompassing, a dominant, burning anchor in each character's minds.  The ending is quite  close to perfection, and throughout the film the events are revealed almost backwards (kind of like Memento).  Overall, this is a great character movie and psychological study of people in traumatic conditions.",21 Grams

In the beginning, you don't understand anything, you have to pay attention to the movie, there are three connected stories, a dramatic accident and charismatic characters, you just have to follow the plot. Iñárritu uses by second (And won't be the last) time his unique method, turning different stories into one.""21 Grams"" defines perfectly what ""Drama"" means, at the end, you get a bitter taste in the mouth.The actors were correctly dedicated to their characters, causing a realistic and sad vision of the story. In conclusion, a masterpiece. Oh, I forgot to talk about music, music was one of the best things in the movie, I liked it a lot. Now I've finished., and I must say: Congrats Iñárritu, you did it again.",21 Grams

Every element of this movie is great, cinematography, director, edition, and most of all, actors performances, and in this specific topic, the one that is sublime and awesome is Naomi Watts, what a performance!!! i'm still in shock, though it's been almost a month since i saw this movie. Naomi is simply great, and proves that's she's is for real. She really deserves the Oscar in a leading role for this year. Watch out for upcoming movies of this actress.",21 Grams
336,Spike289,a gripping suspense that won't let go.,8,3 June 2004,"21 grams is a great movie if you don't mind being confused for half of the time. Even though the movie is all jumbled and scenes are repeated and flashbacks are constant throughout the whole movie the director did a good job of keeping it all in order there was only a few times that I had no idea what was going on and even though I was confused for a minute I caught up within the next minute. I think that this movie ruffly resembles Pulp Fiction which I think is one of the best films of all time and far out does this movie. However I believe that this film was made brilliantly and that both Sean Penn and Naomi Watts should be recognized for there performance, I mean they should't have gotten a Oscar or anything but I was glad to see Naomi Watts get nominated and the only reason that Sean Penn wasn't nominated was because he had already been nominated Mystic River. However lets get back to the movie there are still some of the scenes that I'm not sure how they got there but overall I think that this film was a staggering performance by both the actors and the director.",21 Grams

Lack of knowledge allowed me to watch this movie without high or low expectations.My conclusion: An excellent movie in terms of acting, aesthetics and story, but somewhat vague when connecting to the last thirty minutes.""21 Grams"" definitely seems like the sort of movie worth a second viewing. There was such an abundance of tiny details, and the sequencing out of order, I feel any attempt at further judgment will be hindered. I would recommend taking some of the other suggestions on this board with a grain of salt, because they seem to be misinterpreting the movie in various ways. No fault of the authors of prior posts, I simply think this is a movie you should judge for yourself.",21 Grams
338,tengis45,Powerful movie,9,27 January 2006,"21 Grams is very powerful movie  it'll touch your feelings on a deep level. The story itself is not so special, it is the way the story is being told that makes this movie so special. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu films this movie in a very unconventional way. By so filming he delivers some moments of extreme raw emotional impacts that other movies fail to show.The first 20-30 minutes of this movie seems to have no purpose or story. But as the movie goes on the script provides answers and we get rewarded for watching this movie till the end.Sean Penn plays a sick man who has a dying heart and a rotten relationship with a girl. He plays his part brilliantly and proves again that he is a great actor. Del Toro gives also a genuinely raw performance as a reformed Christ. But to me, Naomi Watts gave the most intriguing, raw and emotional performance. After watching Mulholland Drive I knew she was a great actress, and her performance in this movie justified my thought 100 percent.The nonlinear directing of this movie was maybe a little too much for me. I thought it didn't reach the greatness of Memento or Reservoir Dogs. But the single scenes of this movie were outstandingly acted and delivered the punches their own ways.I highly recommend this movie",21 Grams

341,malaclyptic,why Acting is an art form,9,18 April 2005,"Three lives are connected by a tragic car accident in Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu's riveting film about the confusing prisms of life, love and the promise of happiness.Iñárritu's debut, Amores Perros, gave the world notice of his talent, and some detractors of 21 Grams like to cite that film's shared elements: three characters connected by a car crash, as if every film-goer had seen it and spends their days dwelling on these things. 21 Grams stands alone as a unique, powerful examination of the small and large events that bring people together.In a fractured, non-linear narrative style that sometimes jumps ahead of itself and then backwards, we meet three principle characters, flawed people with deep wounds both physical and psychic. Paul, (Sean Penn, in a much different, but equally brilliant role from his other acclaimed 2003 performance in Mystic River) is a mathematics professor with a bum heart--a condition he doesn't exactly appease by sneaking a cigarette every time his wife Marianne (Melissa Leo), is out of the house. Only a transplant will save his life, but maybe he doesn't care. Penn plays Paul with a subtle shiftiness. We gather from certain looks and exchanges that he's had a history of infidelity, even with his female students, and that Marianne has left him before--and come back. She stays with him now, warily devoted, and intends to have his artificially inseminated baby, whom he'll likely never get to meet.Naomi Watts, in a justly Oscar-nominated role, is Christina, a former druggie (the first times we see her she is alternately in a Narcotics Anonymous group and then doing up coke in a bathroom) married to Michael (Danny Huston), and raising two little girls. Her stability seems anchored on her family, but something in Watts's subtle performance hints that this woman could come unhinged at any time.Perhaps the film's most powerfully conflicted character is Benicio Del Toro's Jack, an ex-con and recovering alcoholic who has seemingly channeled his penchant for addiction into an almost demented Jesus-freakdom. Like many addicts who replace more tangible drugs with the one called faith, Jack comes unglued when tempted. In one scene, his son and daughter fight at the dinner table, and his son slaps his sister on the arm. Jack has her hold out her other arm, saying ""Frank, slap the other arm."" He tells his daughter that when someone slaps your left cheek, you let them slap the other one, too.It's Jack who triggers the tragic events, some of which we glimpse early, with no idea how they fit together until the end. He accidentally kills Christine's family, all at once, and while Michael lies in a hospital bed, his brain slowly winding down, Christine authorizes the transplant of her husband's heart into Paul.It is Paul's need to know where his second chance came from that will eventually undo him, as Jack once again questions his faith, and Christine turns to her old habits. The director and his collaborator, screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga, obviously took pains to carefully construct their story in its non-chronological way. The biggest question, repeated endlessly, is whether or not the story would have been as powerful if edited into a more linear style...and it's irrelevant. Whatever their intent, the fractured style more closely resembles the messy confusion of our own lives, and seems to be asking itself if there's a meaning to all of it. As Paul eventually tells Christine, ""It takes so many little things for two people to meet."" The small things, as much as the more dramatic events of life, resonant through time, building up to something that may or may not lead to some kind of redemption. ""Life doesn't just go on,"" Christine says, but the power of 21 Grams may ultimately be in the assertion that life has to. You can't stop it. Whatever ""meaning"" can be gleaned from this remarkable film, it would be hard to come away from it unchanged.",21 Grams
342,KenVeryBigLiar,One of the best movies i have ever seen...,10,12 May 2005,"This is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen. It starts out with fragments of the lives of the main characters, chronologically mixed, which makes it difficult to follow at first. Kind of reminds me of Memento or Pulp Fiction, when at first we don't understand what's going on. But as the movie progresses, all the pieces start to come together and it starts to make sense, bit by bit. We can then see how the lives of all the characters are interconnected. This is a very powerful movie that deals with the lives of several very different people, each with his own complexity, as some tragic events happen...I definitely recommend it. As a final note i would just like to say that the actors were brilliant and the script is fantastic.",21 Grams
343,malwong,shuffled scenes,7,6 May 2005,"I flipped by this once -- on cable in Tokyo -- and then came back to it when I couldn't find any of the NBA playoff games on. There's something sad about having 100 stations and nothing's on, except for 21 Grams which I picked up in the middle.Much has been said of the non-linear narrative style of this film, but I found that I quickly understood the entire story and the relationships even having missed the beginning because of the flashback and forwards. Extrapolating from the other comments, it may have even been easier to understand the story having missed the beginning. Usually, I hate missing the beginning of movies, but not in this case.I think that the narrative structures of Amores Perros, Momento (especially brilliant), and Pulp Fiction worked better -- if I were to rate them.Sean Penn and Naomi Watts were great. Their love/sex scene was short but pretty intense and left me pondering about where the line between ""gratuitous"" and ""what is necessary to propel the story forward"" (see: Monster's Ball vs Swordfish) should be drawn. If a story's all about sex and violence, you will need to show it and if it is not, then you should cut away? Or is it: I can't tell you what it is, but I know it when I see it? Hmmm.",21 Grams
344,kenhighcountry,Dead People Walking,10,27 November 2003,"When we got home from seeing 21 Grams last night, my fiancee said: ""I don't know why we went. We could have just stayed home and hit each other with hammers instead.""It is that powerful.Almost every review that I've read of the film managed to use the word ""wrenching."" They're understating. It is not an emotional film. You will not shed a tear. You may, at times, forget to breathe.Life does not always go on. What happens when the soul dies, but the body doesn't? What is death, and who carries the weight of it? These are questions asked by the film. It also explores the way that lives, and deaths, intersect - bringing people together, or sending them spinning away out of orbit. I suspect that I will be thinking about this film for weeks, or months, before I can put it to rest. I won't give any spoilers here. There really are none. Even if you know everything that will happen, you won't be prepared for the power and the impact. Benicio Del Toro, Naomi Watts, and Sean Penn all turn in performances which are breathtaking, both in their depth, and in their restraint. Sean Penn has somehow evolved into one of the finest performers of a generation. He is without vanity, or even self, and has become, in the truest sense of the word, an Actor. And Melissa Leo (who you may remember from the TV series ""Homicide:Life On The Street) turns in an Oscar caliber supporting performance, nearly walking away with every scene she is in.21 Grams left me stunned, thinking, and a little bit out of breath. And though the ending holds out hope for life, and even for redemption, it is not an upbeat happy ending. It is more like the feeling of finishing a marathon.This is a film which will not leave your mind, or leave you at peace. I would not recommend that you go see it if you are feeling at all emotionally fragile, or if your Xanax prescription has lapsed. But in a cinema world full of fluff and crap, this is a dark jewel waiting for you to mine.",21 Grams

Sounds dramatic and gives you the idea that this film is about dying in some higher level.. Well it was nothing like that. This just gave the idea that when doing a heart transplant, including the heart, one gets this heart's former owner's ""soul"". The film was tried to film like Memento. It did not work at all. Very confusing, I had to watch the film 30minutes before I understood all the characters, and the rest. After I realized that , I guessed how the movie is going to end. Ok, transplanted heart did not work, problems, falls in love to the wife of the heart's former owner, makes a child with her, tries to kill the former owner's body's murderer. I can not believe that this film was even nominated for Oscar's, this probably gives some idea about the taste of American's.  Grade:5",21 Grams

The director left gaps in the narrative to allow my imagination free fall - and even at the finale, I was like...wow! Did that really happen? Though I was not emotionally driven through a catharsis, my brain was made to work hard in every scene. The film keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat, partly because of the powerful script and also because the actors are driven and charged with electricity.

The excitement lasted about 5 minutes of the movie. It was a total mess, nothing made any sense, the time frame was completely random and had the most stupid ending I've had ever seen in a movie. After the movie ended, I just wanted to go beat the people who sold me the ticket and get my 5 euros back. The characters acting was not bad, but the script, the filming, everything else was just too bad to even look at. The creators themselves must have realize the movie was crap, so they decided to cut the film and glue it together randomly, so that it would look different and people wouldn't notice how bad the movie is, and looking at the score that it has here on IMDb, it looks like their sad and unfortunate plan worked.

354,skisox24,Acting Outweighs Its Heavy Spirit,8,22 January 2004,"21 Grams is an engrossing movie watching experience.  The cinematography complements the mood perfectly with its muted colors, dark shadows and grainy scenes. This is a dark movie with a storyline as naked as your daily newspaper account of a tragic accident, so don't see 21 Grams if your spirit needs uplifting.Director Alejandro Inarritu unfolds his story unconventionally, with flashes of video bites without reference to story chronology.  And like a jig saw puzzle, the story eventually builds at a geometric pace until the pieces begin to fall into place.  Curiously, it works, and for some unexplainable reason, perhaps even more effectively than a conventional telling.Much is owed to the acting skills of an excellent cast.  Naomi Watts is so complete and absorbed by her character that one forgets that we are watching a portrayal.  Sean Penn and Benecio Del Toro, the other two main characters, are incredibly in synch with the movie's mood and the characters that they play.  This film is worth seeing for the performances alone.Yet something is missing.  The movie seemed too unnatural with its mood. All of the main characters carry a demeanor reminiscent of that of many of Bergman's films of years past.  Yet it seems forced, perhaps because it is hard to accept that three unrelated characters from such disparate roots and social standing, somehow find themselves adopting the very same look of introspection and hollowness.On an intellectual and entertainment level I was pleased with 21 Grams. However, as one who sheds tears at Hallmark Card commercials, I found myself emotionally detached from these characters in spite of the tragedy suffered by them all.This is not a cookie cutter movie, nor is it a masterpiece.  It is compelling and many will appreciate its positive values on many levels, nonetheless.",21 Grams
355,bbdk,An average movie that managed to annoy me again and again.,4,3 March 2004,"Great actors, mediocre screenplay, poor editing. This should have been drama of the decade. The director had it all. The story and the actors. Unfortunately the editing is something that my 10 year old son could have done. I realize that the director and the writer wanted it this way, but for gods sake.. What's wrong with just telling a great story as it is? The story and the actors would have brought the art out in this (nearly) no matter what. I suspect that the screenwriter is a very charismatic person and dropped his script on the way to the director. It got totally intermingled and he didn't have the time to put it in the right order, so he just convinced the director, that taking random chapters out of the script and filming/editing in that sequence is all the rave in Hollywood nowadays. I can safely say that I for one, couldn't dream of buying the DVD, much less see this movie again. I'm amazed at how high the score is for this movie. Either people vote entirely for the story as a whole and the actors, or most people see confusion as an artform to be admired. Time is linear and so should most of a movie be. 3 timelines/flashbacks in a movie is ok, 20 is not.",21 Grams
356,sammyjohnson71,"great acting, superb direction, pretentious movie",8,14 January 2004,"This is one of those movies where all the parts of it are quite good, but the sum of those parts is pretty blah and blase. Inarratu's shot selection is superb and his editing is flawless. But the film suffers because the story is rather implausible and pretentious as can be. Without giving anything away, let me just say that it is easy to make a movie that amounts to a parade of horribles - that tries to push viewers to think it is about something because it is depressing and in fact says nothing.Put simply: What's the point?The answer: there is none, other than to show off as a director and fail as a storyteller.",21 Grams
357,consultant_liz99,Interesting,8,27 January 2012,"21 Grams features performances by Sean Penn, Benecio Del Torro and Naomi Watts that are remarkable not only for their believability, but also for the range of gut wrenching emotion they bring to bear. Telling his story almost violently out of sequence, Iñárritu makes no apology for presenting information in a manner that is often abrupt and/or confusing. His choice to juxtapose a myriad of images to reveal the complexities and subtleties of the characters challenges the viewer even as it elevates the story.Each of the three main characters faces a series of crises that unfold in the fullness of Iñárritu's version of time. By so carefully painting characters' surroundings along with their reactions to the events that change their lives, lead characters are stripped to the bone. The supporting cast is nothing short of miraculous (notably Clea Duvall, Charlotte Gainsborg and Melissa Leo) and completes a wonderfully complex series of portraits of the three main characters.Like few films in recent memory, 21 Grams fully reveals what it is to be human in the clutches of life's most challenging moments.",21 Grams
358,randall-32,It felt like this movie was missing something.,7,14 June 2004,"When I went into the film I thought I would be watching a movie that gets more involved with the meaning of life and mathematics. Unfortunately, the title is a misnomer, and doesn't apply to the movie at all. The fact that Penn is a mathematician doesn't play any significant role in the movie.The format of the movie flashes forward in time, back in time, forward in time, back in time, so you never really know where you are until about halfway through the movie. I suspect they did this because it would be too boring to watch from the start to the finish. They did a good job with the editing, but this type of family crisis drama movie isn't deserving of using so many flashbacks.All the actors did a pretty good job, but I couldn't help feeling like I'd be able to watch this on TV in about a year. It felt like this movie was missing something.7/10",21 Grams
359,ssloan,Complex film with no empathetic characters,3,24 April 2005,"This film took a complex approach in which scenes were presented out of sequence, a la Pulp Fiction. This added to Pulp Fiction's intriguing and complex plot. In contrast, it significantly detracted from this film which was much more about the characters than the plot.Unfortunately for a film that was centered on the characters, this film had no characters with which one could empathize, except for one female character, and even she was hard to feel for. In fact, very few of these characters were easy to understand. The acting for the most part was good and at times exceptionally good. But the script was not written well - the characters motivations and responses to situations did not make sense at many times. And when they did make sense, one just ended up hating the characters more. When one dislikes almost all of the characters, how can one care about much of anything in this film?",21 Grams
360,khobor2002,lazy movie making,2,14 February 2008,Another commenter said that the time scrambling was done to make a very boring and bad movie interesting. I absolutely agree. I could not understand why this time scrambling was essential for this movie. The other commenter's comment made me realize the reason. It seemed like the movie maker was being lazy and instead of tell the story as simply and clearly as possible (which I think is always the most difficult thing to do) he decided to incorporate a whole bunch of movie making tricks to make it look like it is a great movie. Like in an exam when you don't know the answer to the question and you use beautiful language to obfuscate that.,21 Grams

The screenplay and cinematography is quite unique..U will be puzzled initially saying whats the hell is going around..!! But soon you will realize that 3 stories are running in parallel and stitched together wonderfully. Some scene will make you CRY and some will force you to think about life...

362,weaselco,Am I the only one who hates this film!,4,14 August 2005,"So its starts out with a tit. So far so good. Then it follows with a scene. Followed by another scene. And another. Now the problem is they seemingly have nothing to do with each other. You know why? Because this film tries to be tricky. It doesn't want to be the same olé, same olé. The problem being it is. Just because you show a manipulative drama in a scattered order of events doesn't mean you have a masterpiece. It means you have an average plot, boring ass, movie thats hard for old people to follow. If you were to watch Pulp Fiction in regular order it would still be a masterpiece, but this film would be a mediocre, talking heads piece, without any real outstanding dialog. The fact the filmmaker tried to be so pretentious and all you pretentious critics who thinks the editing can make a movie need to stop being so full of crap and give this film what it really deserves.",21 Grams
363,charcoalphoto,Brilliant,10,7 February 2006,"This is one of the most brilliantly acted films I have ever seen. I've seen a lot of films from all different decades, but this one tops them all in the performance category.Benicio Del Toro plays Jack Jordan, an ex-con who is a born again Christian. He goes on to doubt his own belief in Jesus when a terrible tragedy happens which ties in the lives of the other two characters. His performance is subtle and incredibly effective as a man tormented by the events in his life. Del Toro is able to convey bare emotion with just his eyes.Sean Penn plays Paul, the man tormented by his health. He needs a heart transplant and he gets it through the donation of Cristina's husband. Sean Penn is one of my favorite actors simply because it doesn't seem like he is really acting. All of his performances ring true. He has a raw talent that seeps into his work.To me, the bravest performance in this film is done by Naomi Watts. She plays Cristina Peck, the grieving mother whose family is killed in a tragic accident. Her performance is so brave and she captures every tormented emotion brilliantly. That's the only word that can describe it. You simply have to see it in order to fully understand what I'm trying to say. It will blow you away. Stun you.The film intercuts between the three lives, showing key moments in each. It cuts from the past to the future to the present. It's like a puzzle that you have to solve. To hear it spoken may make it seem confusing, but the drama inside is so raw that it's not noticeable. You become completely absorbed within the lives of these people as they try to survive the tragedies that have overcome them.Depressing though the film is, it is also a movie of hope. Every character has a moment where they realize that life goes on. Life never stops. It keeps on rolling. The people within it stops. But once enough events happen, those people begin rolling again and life goes on.",21 Grams
364,cedricc,Traffic + Pulp Fiction = Rip-Off + Headache,1,11 January 2004,"This movie had a good idea, wait... no it didn't.  21 grams is better explained to someone in 5 minutes than shown for 2 hours 5 minutes.  It super-played with time -- how things were presented -- but was too too much and didn't present them in a way that kept my interest... if you want something interesting like that, see Memento, Pulp Fiction, or Run Lola Run.The camera use was handheld, grainy, with filters, which made me think immediately of traffic, but point is, its use was fun regulated here and was more distracting because I kept thinking of what the director wanted the movie to be.The acting was good (by Penn and Watts), but Del Toro looks awkward and his accent was horrible (is that his real voice... wait... does it matter?)... Too bad there wasn't a solid substance behind the movie for it to be worth an oscar or my time or money... what lesson is learned, what was gained. The whole ""mathematics of life"" deal doesn't really play in at all (where's the correlation)... and what was amazing was that I had a 6th sense about that... after the first 2 minutes, I was p***ed off because I saw that the movie had no point.I definitely would not recommend this movie.  There are so many other better movies this season.  Check out In America or Mystic River instead.",21 Grams
365,chrismik,Interesting journey through time...,8,23 March 2004,"This film is a really interesting journey through time. The start of the movie leaves the viewers somewhat confused as to what is really happening, but once one starts to understand the lack of chronological events, the film really gets exciting. Every scene helps the viewer solve the mystery piece by piece. The actors all deliver great performances.The feel of the movie is very depressing (as intended), and the entire movie is lacking of bright colors or happy environments. This is adding  to the overall impression.I really recommend this film to other interested viewers. This might not be the film you sit down and see when you want some fast entertainment though - some patience and focus is required.",21 Grams
366,SAYSI,"An intelligent, sensitive and human portray of fatality",10,26 June 2004,"Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, becomes with "" 21Grams"" a master craftsman  that can push psychological boundaries and proves that to understand  the Americans, you don't have to be one. And very often foreign  directors that tackle American psyche do so in an intelligent and often  very accurate and sensible way. Even though this film could have had  characters from any country. Of course this is the case with the  director of this brilliant film. I had to see it twice under very  different circumstances and both times i left with a profound  satisfaction of watching a great film. The work of Sean Penn, Benicio  Del Toro , Naomi Watts and Charlotte Gainsbourg is superb. Overall for  me, the best film of 2003",21 Grams
367,passetemps,Even better the second time,10,27 January 2004,"I will not explain the movie plot or comment about how exquisite the acting was, just one look at all the users' comments and all I could say has already been said.But after a second viewing of this movie (only 1 month later from the first) I'd like to say that yes, the work of the 3 lead actors are good beyond definition, I was still engaged in the movie from beginning till end even though I already knew the story, and all three deserve the acting Oscar for this year.Sean's work was every bit as good as his work in Mystic River, but I guess he got the nomination for the latter only because it's a more standing out role. In 21 grams, his role is more subdued, but he played it so well it made Naomi's acting stand out more.Benicio's acting was so moving, my heart just ached for his character and his limitations.I'd be very happy if he wins another Oscar (Tim Robbins was excellent in Mystic River too, frankly it's hard to tell who's better but I'm so partial to Benicio, he is just a joy to watch).",21 Grams

You will see several pieces but you can't see the whole thing. In the beginning it is very confusing and exhausting. But the more you get into the story, the more you understand the characters and the time line you will be shocked by the tragic story. It is a story about relationships, broken persons, starting a new life and a story about letting the past behind. But as we all know, letting the past behind is not easy. And so this movie gets more and more tragic and depressing. You will see the failure of those persons and you feel with them. I most admit this movie made me nearly cry and personally I would say about me that I'm one of the hard guys who is hard to be moved emotionally by movies.In the end you will be depressed on the one hand but on the other hand you will be fascinated by the amazing style of the movie and the amazing and tragic story.

Very very dissatisfied with the overall effect. Editing sequences differently and creating a collage doesn't mean that a great movie has been made. Somebody has to tell these directors that non-linear is not an equation for greatness. You first need to come up with something ingenious. Don't peep at the lives of these people...they are really nothing characters who are not sure what to do and who are jumping thoughts per second...Poor story,poor screenplay Acting,direction and editing are not to be blamed for this disaster",21 Grams

I absolutely loved the way the films final cut was not in chronological order. Having the movies' scenes totally random, added to the feeling of the movie. The three main actors, Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, and Benicio Del Toro all gave satisfying and moving performances. I adored the fact, that Naomi Watts didn't look perfect, and gorgeous throughout the movie. Actually, she looked like crap throughout most of the movie, but she was still Fantastic as Christina Peck. I personally never liked Sean Penn, but this movie, mad me fall in love with him, he is such an amazing actress. Benicio Del Toro. Wow. No words to describe how truly, truly, blown away i was by his performance. All in all, ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, i watched it over and over again, and probably will for years.

Cast is great, acting is fantastic, plot is good... but why ""time-travel""? Perhaps I wouldn't recommend watching it if you're sleepy, but still a great movie.But, no matter how good it is, the fact that they keep ""time-travelling"" to me is just a way of trying to make it a ""different"", original movie, which is pretty annoying, and doesn't make much sense, and that's why I'm giving this a 5.",21 Grams
372,Alexey-Bogoslavsky,"Not too bad, but there's something extremely irritating about it",4,13 March 2006,"The strange thing about the movie is that I can't decide whether I liked it or not, and that doesn't happen often to me. On the one hand, I enjoyed every moment of Penn's brilliant performance. I liked Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts very much, too. The plot is original but consistent and doesn't seem artificial at all.But on the other hand, I can't think of words strong enough to describe the irritation I felt because of the wildly distorted chronology in the movie. From the very beginning and all the way through the movie, scenes related to the middle and the end of the film are interspersed randomly between other scenes, developing in what distantly resembles the natural chronological order. The technique is disturbing, disappointing and above all - unjustified. It serves no artistic purpose whatsoever. In my case, at least, this has taken out most of the potential pleasure and damaged the overall experience gravely. And, naturally, I couldn't resist the sneaky suspicion the whole thing was merely designed to add to the movie's uniqueness, a goal that by itself I don't consider legitimate.Yet, when you've seen all of the movie, it is not too tricky to figure out the intended order of events. Well, at least that.",21 Grams

I won the tickets and to be honest didn't know what to expect going into the film. From start to finish the film oozes class, from the cinematography to the direction to the top notch cast. Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro are excellent but for me, Naomi Watts stole the show for her excellent portrayal of Christina.The style of the film reminded me of the also excellent Memento in that events occur and are then explained later in the film. This works to excellent effect as it keeps the audience engaged and guessing as to quite how the 3 central characters become interlinked through the films core concept of life, death and revengeThis is Alejandro González Iñárritu's first feature film since Amores perros and his first English film to date, I hope the academy recognise 21 Grams and overlook the overly sentimental tosh that is Sea Biscuit.Naomi Watts for best actress, I guess I'll have to wait and see",21 Grams

I must push my mind very hard to figure out the story. I see that directors are began thinking that if they shuffles the scenes the film would be more complicated and more better. I think that is very wrong. Directors please just do as usual okay. Don't play with the scenes and say what ever you want straight.I think if the film was in a normal order than i had more pleasure watching the film. Its very simple. But the director put it in the hard way. Maybe he was too lazy to put the film in the right way. Plus i saw very much duplicated scenes.

The only redeeming factor is the quality cinematography.  21 grams steals ideas from films like Magnolia and Memento.  It tries to make a simple story about people who make their problems worse, interesting by reordering events in time.  This is a popular fad in films these days which reminds me of choose your own adventure books, because this is how I imagine these films are created. Instead of providing real content the movie is a hodgepodge of gimmicks. A little life and death drama, some action, some mystery, some blood and guts give it a big budget -- Hey we've got a blockbuster.  To top it off the 21 grams premise is weak and never developed and has very little to do with the rest of the film.  You can leave this movie with the impression that you learned something about life, but just what was it?  Instead watch Amores Perros a quality film by the same Director/Writer duo.",21 Grams

But I would disagree with both of those comments.  The plot was perfect for the non-linear story telling because there is so many twists.  If the acting alone wasn't captivating enough for you to call this a great movie, you have serious issues.  Furthermore, although it is told in non-linear fashion, it is not like anything anyone has ever seen before.  It is completley random from scene to scene. in the beginning you felt a little bit lost, but then it all comes together eventually.  due to the confusing beginning, i gave it a 9/10. but truly a masterpiece.",21 Grams

Sure there some great performances but even with these outstanding actors there wasn't enough there to keep me hooked. I liked the cinematography. Maybe the problem was that I went expecting to see a dark thriller or something with some bite? Unfortunately it wasn't there.

I was extremely disappointed with this film, it appears to me that the Director has tried to be overly artistic and the story is weak. I must admit that the actors are good in their roles, but that is because Del Toro & Watts (and i guess Penn) are all top notch actors. It seems people like to say (as well as the critics) that this is a movie all about hope and despair and tragedy etc. etc. That does not in its own make a Good film, i thought that the characters were all bad people i had no sympathy for any of them.

The performances are believable and compelling.  The storytelling device, on the other hand, is a different story.There's a reason for the film to be out of chronological order, but it hangs by a thread and isn't essential to the story.  Just like Pulp Fiction, the device is interesting, but unnecessary and ultimately distracting.  The story itself is very predictable, and I found myself wondering numerous times when it was going to end.It was worth seeing to find out what all the hype was about, but I left the theater angry and disappointed.",21 Grams

I felt like Grams does the same disjointed storytelling to much more confusing effect.Multiple storylines, in multiple time frames, never sure what came first or which way is up. I found it grew frustrating the longer it went on. By the time all was revealed, I had a headache.That the story line is so bleak and depressing surely doesn't help matters.But if you are sitting around one evening and you are just too happy, then pop this sucker into the DVD player and prepare to go down it's miserable trail.

383,anser316,Very Good,7,18 April 2004,"21 grams is a film I very much enjoyed. The plot was original and worked well. The film overlooks three different lives (a critically ill college professor, a grieving young house-wife and a religious ex-con) and how they are brought together. I found the film slightly confusing at first but the story kicks in later and from then it is very intense and enjoying to watch. Alejandro González Iñárritu's direction proved he can do it in Hollywood. The three actors made powerful performances, especially in my opinion Naomi Watts. Her performance revealed what a formidable actress she really is. Benicio Del Toro shows again his remarkable talent and Sean Penn yet again displays total mastery of his craft. 21 grams is one of the best films I have seen this year, if you like 'dark' type films, you will love this! A must see film.",21 Grams
384,ccxsen,Outstanding from all aspects,10,15 October 2006,"It is difficult to imagine how this film escaped more acclaim. The acting and directing are done with passion and exceptional talent. Although the film requires attention to put the story together, the characters are portrayed so well and the scenes and dialog are so riveting that it comes together as intended: The movie provides a wonderful glimpse of the many sides of humans, our interconnectedness, the unpredictability of everyday life, and the mysteries of the soul which for all cause wonderment. The movie dedication at the end, roughly translated, sums it up best: A lost woman, who burns with passion, comes back to life. The footnote here, perhaps, is that there can be hope where and when we least expect it. The clerk, the homeless person, the bus driver, the couple on the street are all sharing the same journey and perhaps also are carrying the experiences and inspiration to help each of us in our own personal travels.

385,maximusjakeus,Sean Penn should have gotten an Oscar for this movie,10,11 May 2004,"An incredible movie with superb acting, 21 Grams is, in my opinion, one of the best movies of the year. Certainly not for everyone, especially for those who like to see the plot shape up really quick, this movie makes you sit and think, and the acting is incredible. Though Sean Penn was great in Mystic River, I think he should have gotten the Oscar for this, instead. Benicio del Toro had stiff competition with Tim Robbins, but in my own opinion, I think Benicio did the better job. Naomi Watts continues to impress me, with movies like Mulholland Drive and the Ring. This was like icing on the cake for her as far as I'm concerned.Overall, brilliant acting and emotional storyline make this movie one of my top 5 from last year. If you haven't seen it, go rent it.

Sean Penn, he really a good choice for this film. I couldn't think of any other person than him for this role. Benicio Del Toro, he is the best.

I read a few reviews and they all suggested it was excellent, so I let myself be persuaded. Big mistake.Without giving too much away, the film is shown deliberately out of sequence - something that's been done before to much better effect.I can't help feeling if this film was shown in the proper order, it could have been over in about 20 minutes - the plot reminds me of an episode of Casualty or ER.Three of us watched the film together, and all had the same opinion - a boring film, average acting, limited plot, and creating no sympathy for the characters at all.Please don't waste your time.",21 Grams
388,cashhoney2000,Confusion meets Perfection,8,22 September 2004,"Guillermo Arriaga definitely had me confused at the start of the movie. the way he writes this story is absolutely one of a kind. At first I thought the scene with Christina and Paul where Christina is lying naked and Paul is smoking was in another life. I started to think the movie was about destiny, which it is, but I thought it was like Sliding doors with Gwyneth Paltrow. When the plot starts to unfold I was so excited. What a complex way to write a screenplay. That complexity marks difference. I love seeing different movies. Not the every day blockbuster kind. Everything comes together at some point in the movie. Like when Christina's sister Claudia tells her bye at the pool, in the end we realize that its at this point her family is being run over by Jack. The theme seems to be that life goes on, Christina's fathers says this to her and Paul also says it at some point. The movie is a dark expression of life going on, but it still shows this especially with Paul dying in the end, leaving Chrisina with no one. however she is pregnant so again the theme shows that life goes on. Guillermo is an exceptional writer. I heard he teaches. I only wish there were teachers like that at my school.",21 Grams
389,ckaupp,I watched most of this movie convinced it was directed by Clint Eastwood,2,6 October 2005,"Making a movie jump around from scene to scene does not add anything to a linear story like this one. This movie was about the most boring piece of film I've sat through since I sat through Mystic River... maybe it was Sean Penn's overacting that made me think of Clint Eastwood's boring directorial style. Hard to tell.The story was interesting enough: guy needs heart, other guy dies, guy gets heart, or whatever. It wasn't until about 45 minutes into the movie that I figured out who was who and what their relationships were to each other. Usually in one of these twist-plot-based movies, they leave the twist out until the end, but like Clint Eastwood's movies, the twist was revealed about halfway through, then the other half was the falling action. Geez, I couldn't keep my eyes open.Anyway, I highly don't recommend this movie, not even if you're trying to kill time.",21 Grams

The heavy drama is poured on so thick that you quickly become numb to it. Amorres Perros had a more elaborate and interesting plot, so if you want to see three narratives intertwined by a horrific car crash, watch that one instead.

I now understand why IMDb users has been praising it since it was released in 2003, not to mention people I know who've seen it.21 Grams reaches many themes during the movie, and has some of the best acting you'd find in a movie like this.The movie is not to be understood to start with, you get a story in bits and pieces, that you get to put together through out the movie, you see flash backs, flash forwards, though this might seem a bit confusing, it is put together by the writers, in a way that I've never seen before.If you haven't seen 21 Grams before, do it as soon as you can, I promise, this is not a movie to miss out on",21 Grams

But by the time the credits were playing out, I wasn't sure what had come over me, why I felt the way I did. The film had basically blown me over. This is by far the best movie I have ever seen, second only to Shawshank Redemption. It affected me for days. The actors, all of them do complete justice to their roles. The utter helplessness that the three protagonists feel is so discernible. A hit and run brings three people together in ways they never imagined. Naomi Watts is spectacular. Every scene is chiseled and better than perfect. The narration at the end along with the credits is chilling. What if something as innocuous as this accident happens to any of our loved ones? Man! that thought was scary. Its a piece of art. This film should be rated among the best movies of all times. You would regret it if you let this movie go by. I hope more such movies come by.",21 Grams

395,Juan80,Cause and effect,9,13 June 2005,"First 20 minutes of ""21 Grams"" made me a little confused and lost in space of director's imagine, so watching this movie needed a highest careful to not sink in waterfall of several theoretically unlinked plots. First impression that came on my mind was, that the structure reminds ""Memento"", however ""Memento"" was definitely clearer to handle, because we disposed a knowledge about reverse tribe of following events. Here, the chaos dominates through the first part of movie, but afterward you may persuade yourself, that anything happens without reason. Every single cut is clearly caused and I had no feeling that something is redundant, that something doesn't really make a sense or is put without certain reason. And if you feel that plot keeps itself in one piece, then you may concentrate yourself on feelings and depth. Some people talk, that ""21 Grams"" is indeed a simple story and the cutting that has been exerted was actually only an artistic whim. You may like it, you may not, but I know one simple thing. Once I have watched this movie, I believed in that and I believed in what actors wanted to create and give us in an artistic remittance. Naomi Watts made his best creation, with dramatic passion, with authentic mimicry, expression. It is really unbelievable how often had she changed: once she was a mother for children, wife for husband, once she let things slide plunging in narcotic vision to be finally determined and furiously directed on bloody revenge. Sean Penn had been slightly eclipsed by Naomi, however it can't be said that he's average or poor. Penn is a type of actor, that all the time looks neurasthenic, so he doesn't really need to radically change his behavior. Actually I don't think any other actor would have been played his role better, it isn't even his fault, but it is Watts' acting who was absolutely tremendous and in fact on her arms almost entire plot's weight rested. The third link in movie was Benicio del Toro, and I may only say that he definitely made a good job and when you ascertain that a movie had been really good acted and screenplay was written by ""Guy of Amores Perros"" you receive a simplest comment of ""21 Grams"" which I absolutely recommend.",21 Grams

You cannot but weep for the truth it shows. Every actor belonged to their part. Every scene was meant to be there Every line was spoken as if it was life or death An epic worthy of Puzo with such sensitivity as to tear you in opposites. The story can be given to many maligned persons. The personal detail that has been put to film. Until the Godfather I thought the investigations to the phsych were fictional, this is so amazingly real I was scared.

There is general agreement that the quality of the performances of the principal actors is very high. The editing style seems to be the issue. My initial reaction was one of confusion and a little irritation but I was intrigued enough to stick with it, so for me at least it succeeded in drawing me in. Non-linear story telling of this sort is surely not the same as the flash-back technique of Citizen Kane, which by modern standards is pretty linear. What makes this film more challenging, more stimulating is that it dips back and forth in the timeline in a way that forces you to pay attention and suspend judgement on the characters and what they are doing/have done/are about to do.My final judgement is that this a work of cinematic art, and whether you love it or hate it is determined by whether or not you are prepared to suspend your disbelief, accept what you are being shown and how you are being shown it. Bottom line - it's a serious film, not just another glossy story like so much of what we see. Art, not simply entertainment.",21 Grams

No one star shone above the rest.I also liked the ending as much as I wanted it to end differently. It was real, heart-wrenching and honest. Not a sappy, feel-good predicable ending.

The audience is introduced to the lives of a few individuals throughout the movie. The story is told such that the audience does find themselves actually caring about what is happening to these people. The movie starts out as a puzzle but as the movie progresses, it effectively pieces the puzzle together for the audience. The revelation of the meaning of ""21 grams"" at the end of the movie effectively ties the entire story together.",21 Grams

I spent the whole film constantly adjusting the volume. When no one is speaking, the background noises - or music - are deafening. You can almost see a sound technician pushing up the sliders. When someone speaks the volume is right back down again. I wish film producers would test the soundtrack on people who have nothing to do with the film - to see if the dialogue is clear. I listened to quite a lot of it several times, increasing the volume each time. If, after doing this several times, I still didn't understand what was said, I gave up.",21 Grams

405,brendanjmalloy,"Worth the Eight Bucks, But...",7,4 January 2004,"Well, I just saw 21 Grams.  After having seen Amores Perros I was really excited.  The story revolves around a transplanted heart and three characters that are all hell-bent on self destruction.  Because of the way the movie sets itself up, I'm hesitant to give any great detail about what actually takes place.  In my opinion, the plot isn't really as exciting as the visual experience anyway...so, I'll just leave it there.First, the cinematography was really...slick.  I thought it added just the right amount of ambient emotion to each scene.  When the characters are in self destruct mode, the film goes grainy and washed out.  But when Christina (Naomi Watts) is happily sailing along, the tone is light and bright, full of color.  I'm not a huge fan of the pseudo-Dogme 95, (dare I say) MTV style, but it looks like it's here to stay and for the most part I think it is used effectively in 21 Grams.Watts, del Torro, Penn, all give really good performances.  Watts is one of those rare actresses that once you've seen her, you just want to keep her a secret so she doesn't end up selling her talent out in something like Terminator 10.  Her performance in Mulholland Dr. was so well done that I don't know if she'll ever be able to live up to it in my eyes.  She doesn't disappoint here; her performance is above par.The direction seems a little...I don't know.  A little over the top maybe. But I'm not sure if it's a result of the story, the non-linear narrative or what feels like the total narcissism of all of the characters.  I couldn't connect with these people, so the scenes that called for strong emotional interactions with the audience left me feeling like they're a bit melodramatic.The same sort of narrative technique was used in the film Amores Perros, but much more effectively.  I don't mind working for satisfaction after having seen a movie, but if the connections between the scenes are so nuanced that the audience is left feeling disconnected from what's taking place on the screen, I don't think the director has succeeded in conveying his vision. I'm all about non-linear narratives, I love David Lynch, but while Iñárritu gets away from traditional style, I think he would have done better if he had had a more compelling reason for using the method.  Stylistically 21 Grams feels like watching an action movie that emphasizes a noirish use of shadow for the sake of making it, er, shadowy.  I don't mind the attempt, I just don't think it works well here.However, I'd absolutely recommend seeing this movie.  This is cutting edge filmmaking, by an up and coming filmmaker.  The style (while not that effective in this particular film), the cinematography, the acting are all very good.  The story just doesn't mesh well with any of the above.  I expect we'll be seeing many, many more movies that will start to take greater liberties with narrative and this is an exciting, if unsuccessful, addition to that movement.",21 Grams
406,nonis,Good acting in dull movie,4,9 February 2004,"Maybe it's just me, but since Memento, movies telling events in chronological order seem to be outnumbered by movies filled with flashbacks and weird timejumps. Some succeed in still telling a gripping story, and some, like 21 Grams, don't.After about a half-hour of this film you know pretty much everything that's going down, and the rest of the time is spent waiting for it to happen. Personally I think it would have worked much better in chronological order.. certainly couldn't have been worse. There's not even any logic to the ordering of events, it just seems very random.Strong performances by especially Benicio Del Toro, but also Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and all the others, are the only thing that kept me from walking away from this one.Boycott this one, and Cold Mountain too, so we might get some proper movies again. If you're really into the new style of storytelling, try the french Irreversible. At least that one has some structure..My vote: 4/10",21 Grams
407,caverlydw,Acting overcomes somewhat inane plot devices,7,14 February 2004,"**SPOILERS**In total, I enjoyed 21 Grams, mostly for the performances, score, and cinematography.  The basic plot is without a doubt, the weakest aspect of the movie.  The dialogue is borderline at best, and it is only due to the credit of a great cast, that is does not sink into unintentional comedy. The best of the group is Benicio Del Toro, as I was always captivated during his on screen moments. A close second was Naomi Watts, who, while being only average while playing a ""normal"" housewife and mother, excels as a grieving widow who has also lost her 2 children and eventually seeks revenge. Sean Penn plays his oft replicated brooding character, a little most subdued than usual thus avoiding his penchant to overact.I cannot help but comment on what I believe is an inherent underlining statement being made by numerous films today - that being that the weakness of woman directs man to bad choices and cause tragic events. (very biblical). It is Christina who pushes Paul to attempt the killing of Jack. The script goes out of its way to let us know that she was seriously into drugs prior to her marriage to Michael and thus hints that it is her failings that may have caused the tragedy - she does not deserve happiness. It is Marianne who wants Jack to not own up to the hit and run, to hide his guilt.  It is Mary who only seems to want Paul for his sperm, not really caring about the man himself, his emotions, his soul. Without support from his wife, Paul's path towards tragedy is transversed much more easily.  In general, men are depicted as much more tragic and sympathetic while women are shown as petty, shallow, and in general, having no moral depth. Does Alejandro González Iñárritu believe this?  Does Guillermo Arriaga (writer) intend this?I must comment on the editing/chronology of the film.  To me, the various time frames worked quite well for the first 70-90 minutes of the film.  However, after this, the audience , unless very dense, is fully aware of the eventually outcome and the circumstances leading up to same. Because of this, even with exceptional performances, these 30 - 50 minutes seemed to take forever to realize themselves. The audience knew what scenes were needed to complete the film and waited impatiently for them to occur. Thus a 125 minute movie feels more like a 150 minute movie. I got very impatience over the last 30 minutes of the film. ""Spoiler Alert"" -- I am also left wondering that the revelation that Christina is pregnant means that Paul is the father and that this child is the reason God allowed all the previous tragic events to occur? Overall rating 7.5 out of 10",21 Grams
408,zarsch,a cheap copy of amores perros,3,9 December 2005,"I was sorry to see a good movie as ""Amores Perros"" adapted to the horrible, pitiful ""Hollywood style""... Both Benicio and Penn are believable and moving but the female actress should stick to ""hits"", not serious acting. She is very, very hard to believe. The chronological break down of the story reminds me of Vargas Llosa writings and enhances the story. Let's hope the director can keep true to himself and doesn't start working to make ""hits"", instead of movies.

It's amazing the way Benecio has been given the chance to fill up the entire screen with his presence in this film. It's a tough film to watch for anyone who has lost someone, because it hits upon all those small components of a person's life that you notice once they're gone.

The editing was sub-par, jumping around aside, often we would have no idea what we were looking at or why, and several completely useless scenes are include perhaps to confuese the viewer even more, or perhaps bore them. The dialogue is simplistic, and often seems unreal, no matter how hard the actors try to make it their own. Penn is great, while del Toro puts on a mediocre performance. Naomi Watts is her usual uninteresting self, with her appearantly contractually-obligated nude shots. Oh, and for other useless things in this movie: useless characters.

417,juan_valdez,This is terrible,3,3 January 2004,"Well, what I WANTED to see was Cold Mountain.I was conned into seeing 21 Grams for a 4:30 show because my friends insisted that a Civil War movie was too violent. I watched...and watched... and after what must have been a long time, I figured the movie would end soon, so I asked what time it was. It must be at least 6:15.IT WAS 5 O' CLOCK.It is a real sign of bad filmmaking when Inarritu has this caliber of cast - Penn, Del Toro, and Watts - and still can't make a good movie out of it. I gave this movie a 4 only because Del Toro pulls off what may be his greatest performance yet, and Watts and Penn and etc. you know what I'm saying. The movie, when it was done, felt as if it lasted a month. The disjointed chronology is something many directors like to play with - invented and perfected by Tarantino - but the general goal is to draw someone in to several different areas of the same story line, and end by tying them all together. What 21 Grams does is switch every 10 seconds or so, rendering the beginning only a few hairs shy of incomprehensible. Yes, it's easy enough to understand - but to care about? That takes about 90 minutes, if you ever feel it at all.Throughout the feature, one's mind will occasionally pause and wonder at the meaning of the title. In the last two minutes, this is resolved by a voiceover that reveals a scientific mystery most people haven't heard of. It should be meaningful - the melodrama almost convinces me that it is - but '21 grams' isn't a symbol of anything. It certainly COULD be - but it was never mentioned before, so how can we believe that there's anything to it? The entire notion (that is, the notion of losing 21 grams at death, who/where/whenever) is irrelevant to a storyline preoccupied with what happens to the lovers/friends/relatives of the deceased.I do apologize for going on at such length. But it does take several words to properly dismantle something that is seen by so many people as a deep concept. To any potential responders, I would ask that you not accuse me of ignorance.

At the time we have to try describing what was happen actually. At last we try to figure out who is who and what is relation between one character to the others. Not like (but almost) Amores Perros, this movie is telling about synchronicity, unpredictible situation, and mutual paradox. Alejandro has a God concept related with human perception and ambition. Sometimes it's not happen as we want but sometimes it was. So it is so naif when we try to explain something (that so unpredictible) only with human perception.

This film truly was an emotional rollercoaster, and one that was difficult to watch at times. ""21 Grams"" had many running themes of guilt, forgiveness, pain and the search for catharsis in each of the characters.  It wasn't that the film was visually disturbing, but the stories of the three main characters and their families were so brutal at times that the viewer cannot help but sympathize with them, and truly feel their pain.  Wonderful and provocative (in the truest sense of the word)performances by Del Toro, Penn and Watts only added to the brilliance of this picture.  Real dialogue that never seemed forced or trite in its content really made this film more appreciable for me.

The movie makes you piece a puzzle together which may be distracting to some but personally, I believe it's a brilliant technique. It just requires a bit of patience for the first 30 minutes or so, afterwards, the pieces start falling into place. The most gripping aspect of the movie(IMO) was the questioning of the existence of God and why God chose to put such difficult obstacles in the paths of these characters. Benicio del Toro plays Jack Jordon flawlessly, with such guilt and despair visible through the glare of his eyes alone. All in all, a sad movie with a ray of light at the end of the tunnel.

A movie about real people, dramatic but very human.",10,22 November 2003,"This is not a commercially orientated action movie, it has no invincible kicking stars, no car chases or cars in flames, no wizards or monsters, this is a movie about real people. The acting is superb, out of the ordinary. All are very good, but at least Del Toro deserves an Oscar. It makes you think of real life situations that makes you feel a part of it. You end up by loving each character.The Direction and editing are very good. Hard to understand at first, as changes are made from one character to another and to different time frames, but you soon see how the stories are intertwined. These changes increase the dramatic impact, as does the wonderful photography. Obviously hand-held camera work with well framed and lighted close ups, the Director of Photography interprets thus the drama that the Director and the Script Writer wanted. You either love this movie or dislike it. No middle ground I think.",21 Grams
423,burgundyfiddler,Is plagiarism valid?,3,26 November 2003,"Both of Gonzalez Iñarritu's flicks (Amores Perros and 21 grams) steal blatantly from other movies. The first time around scenes were shoplifted from Quentin Tarantino, among others. Now we are seeing Kieslowsky's ""Blue"" looted in ""21 grams"", albeit without the Polish director's talent.  Atom Egoyan's ""Sweet hereafter"" is also written over the screenplay.This kind of practice is common in TV commercials, the media Iñarritu hails from, but was usually frowned upon in feature films.  The odd thing is that nobody seems to mind or even notice.Even disregarding these aprehensions, ""21 grams"" is far too long and thematically akward.  Truly good film directing, such as Kieslowsky's, can never be imitated.And yes, Naomi is way over the top in several scenes.",21 Grams
424,BearishBo,I hate to say it but I really disliked this movie,1,7 May 2004,"I really don't get why so many people loved this movie.  It was extremely dry and boring, people say it deals with grizzly situations but I did not find them grizzly at all.  The thing that really bothered me is the fact that I did not care for any of the characters which made it just annoying to keep track of the jumping around (past present and future).  I would say memento did a much better job at skipping through time this movie, about 10 minutes in to the movie I had it all figured out which just made the last 1 hour and 55 minutes extremely tedious.    I don't get this new movement people seem to be doing where a lack of plot and character is acceptable if do an ok job of setting the atmosphere.  For me it just makes an extremely dry and boring movie, seems like people who make movies like this are just trying to hard to be artistic.  For some reason this movie reminds me of Gummo.  Now I know a large majority of the people here don't feel the same way, but I thought I would speak up for the small majority of the people who have seen this movie and disliked it.  That is just my opinion.  Although don't say it is wrong because opinions cant be wrong they can just differ from others.",21 Grams
425,colleenclare82,Overrated,1,9 December 2004,"This film is one of the most emotionally manipulative films I've ever seen. It is also one of the most insulting. It is just awful. It attempts to be profound with the 'great' revelation that born again Christians aren't necessarily the greatest people, and that ex-cons really have a bad side underneath it all...uh really? You think? My patience was wearing with the highly overdramatized character of Christina Peck (Naomi Watts), as she wallowed in her own self-pity, skipping the normal process of grieving. And there was no more pathetic character than that of Paul Rivers (Sean Penn), whose obsessive, dying, math obsessed character made me wonder why any woman would find him attractive. The only character I felt any sympathy for was the beautifully acted and portrayed character of Marianne Jordan (Melissa Leo), who perfectly acted the pain of keeping together a family torn by abuse and alcoholism. The biggest problem with this film is that it fails in what it sets out to do. It wants to be a piece to show the dark side of human beings by bringing to surface contradictions that we wouldn't otherwise notice. But it reveals little that isn't already known, and it does not show the faults in everyday people in any sort of entertaining and refreshing way. It simply shows us their lives unfolding backwards, a feat that Seinfeld already accomplished, yet with such better results. In the end it is just dark and dreary, and leaves little to be gained from the experience. The dialogue is trite, the scenes are dreary, and this drama about life reflects nothing more than a teenage angst-ridden attempt to make sense of the world.My life is worse off for having seen it.",21 Grams

And if you liked this overrated steaming pile of merde de chien then I bet you'd love other such gems as ""Punch-Drunk Love"" and ""Lost in Translation"". But seriously, this movie had a very uninspired and pointless plot as well as plenty of gratuitous sex and nudity. The tone of this movie is exceedingly miserable and cynical to the point of being unrealistic. I can't believe I actually sat through the 2+ hours of this abomination. Every character was absolutely repelling and towards the end I wished for them all to DIIIIIIIE!!!!!! This is by far one of, if not THE worst movies I've ever seen.",21 Grams
427,joescrilla,"very good movie, drags itself down towards end",8,2 January 2004,"21 Grams was one of the most excruciatingly emotional films i've ever seen...the performances were spectacular, especially sean penn and benicio del toro. the back and forth style used in the film, which has been somewhat controversial, is not as bad as some people would have you believe.  I feel it works because it gives each scene a unique emotional impact, rather than an emotional impact that builds throughout a film presented in chronological order.The reason i gave this film an 8 instead of a 9 or a 10 is the fact that it really starts to drag towards the end.  you can only stab your viewer in his or heart so many times before you begin to naturally want a resolution...the  resolution is satisfying, but i can't help but feel it should have come about 15-20 minutes earlier.  the director, though very, very talented, needs to learn what to leave out.8 out of 10",21 Grams

429,adtyler,An astonishing piece of work (possible spoilers),10,9 April 2004,"Life is fragile. You can be so sure of something, and then hours later it is gone. Just like that. Never to return. One rash action, one mistake by one person can change everything. Years of steadfast devotion to your religion turns to dust as you take a corner too fast in your truck and kill a man and his two daughters. You rise out of your drug addiction to raise a wonderful family, only to hear that your husband and two daughters have been killed in a hit and run accident. You finally receive a heart transplant less than a month before you are going to die, but you become agonisingly plagued by the guilt that an innocent man had to die in order for you to live. 21 Grams is not just a film. It's a painfully intense study of human emotion, of what happens to people when life goes bad and there's no way to get back to the good. Of the lengths people will go to, trying to get rid of the guilt, the remorse, the pain, the anger, the endless, biting sense of loss. This film graphically documents all those things - every sob can be felt, every scream cuts into you like its the scream of a close friend. You are forced to care about the characters, because you know that deep down they are all innocent, so when you see them tearing each other's lives mercilessly to pieces as a result of what has happened to them, it hurts a lot. I have never felt more uncomfortable watching a film than how I felt watching this film, but equally I don't know if I have ever been more impressed with the overall product.The structure of this film is astonishingly complex. It does not play out as a continuous narrative, but instead leaps about across time - for example the opening shot, the only one which precedes the strikingly stark title, is taken from two thirds of the way through the film's actual chronology. Rarely do two scenes run together logically, more rarely still is a scene longer than a couple of minutes. Hence, as the film progresses, you find yourself looking at the build-up to events which you have already seen, heard about and know the consequences of. This is used to heart-rending effect, particularly with regard to the car accident itself, that which sets the film's events in motion.Early on in the film we are shown the accident from Christina's (the wife and mother), point of view. We hear a message left by her husband with the noise of the girls giggling in the background, then we watch as Christina recieves the phone call informing her of the accident. Later on we are shown the husband leaving the message as he walks along the street with the girls, and immediately we realise that they are a few minutes away from death. It is a harrowing thought and a frightening one, but mercifully we are spared watching the accident... yet. Half an hour later we are back, watching the same scene from a new angle. Our focus is on a gardener which the happy family passes on the way to their doom. They walk out of shot and we wait, we wait, we wait, as the gardener blows dead leaves off a lawn. The wait is agonising and by the time the truck screams through the shot we are both hating and praising the director for the same reason - he has performed the incredible filmmaking feat of making us hold our breath in horrified anticipation for around ten seconds. Not just me - the friend I was watching the film with gasped for breath as I did when we finally moved on to the next scene.The non-chronological structure also makes the film a very gripping experience. As it progresses, you feel as if you are filling in a blank storyboard piece by piece but in the wrong order, and only at the very end do you have a complete picture. It is a very clever technique indeed.The look of the film makes it all the more real. The cinematography is gritty, it has the same base quality as that of a film I might make with my hand-held digital camera. It looks almost dirty, and these visual imperfections are both striking and mirror effectively the imperfections in the lives of the characters. The direction itself is excellent, and Inarritu's too frequent use of close up on his cast adds to the audience's sense of discomfort.This leads me on to the cast themselves. No words of mine can do the performances of Penn, Del Toro and Watts justice. They are without doubt the three best dramatic performances of the year, probably of the decade. My respect for the Academy has fallen again following their failure to supply these three with those coveted golden statuettes they deserve. But that really doesn't matter at all. These three actors have put on a truly unforgettable show. You feel their pain. Not many actors have the ability to do that. Yet, unbelievably, the supporting cast is not outshone, and they too are worthy of great praise.The music, while beautiful, is powerfully understated and used in moderation. This has great effect, enhancing image and dialogue when it is present, and sharpening picture and speech when it is absent.In conclusion.... In fact, every single minute aspect of this film is brilliant. It has simply no weaknesses, and if there is any justice it will become a classic and a benchmark, and young filmmakers all over the world will aspire to recreate its quality. I know I will.Adam",21 Grams

Shows how we can be mistaken about others and that we have to believe in good surprises life can give us. I think Sean Penn should win an Oscar for this film, as his performance is much better than in Mystic River. Another Oscar should be for the argument.Other thing: the end of the movie is the only possible for this story.",21 Grams
432,tariqie,21Grams is a real masterpiece.,10,21 March 2004,"21Grams is a real masterpiece. Even though the story is told in the first few minutes of the movie, the director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is still able to keep interest of the movie by mixing his scenes strategically and through jump cutting. I think that he has given `Memento' another life. He takes us through lives of three totally different people who have connected together through a series of unexpected events. The three major characters are played by Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro. The move has a typical Christian theme. Benicio Del Toro is playing a born again Christian, devoted to spread this feeling to his acquaintances but ends up questioning some of the very basic of his own believes. The mastery of movies lies in the subsequent motifs running side by side in the movie. I was able to pick up on quite a few of them. The movie suggests possibility of life after death (death motif), abandonment by God and how people can affect each others without knowing them (chance encounters).By elaborating on Benicio Del Toro's part I do not want to take emphasize off of Sean Penn's role as a mathematician and a heart patient.  He was messenger or a whole different theme in the movie that related to how people affect each other without ever knowing about it. I think that this is the best movie to be analyzed for angles, lighting and dialogue. The whole movie is mostly shot on the eye level view giving us the sense of story telling. A classic scene from the movie is Benicio Del Toro's dinning table shot which illustrated the story telling style. The sense showed the distance of the family from each other, like in Orson Welles showed the incompatibility and distance of husband in wife in Citizen Kane.Movie is a must see. Directing and acting is just superb. Shawn Penn should have gotten an Oscar from this performance. This movie is out story as we tend to blame God for all the mishaps that we encounter.",21 Grams
433,tupertay-1,A great film. A must see.,10,3 April 2004,"Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu has put himself on my favorites list with this movie. I haven't seen Amores Perros in it's entirety, but I sure hope it's as good as this movie. These are the reasons why I LOVED 21 Grams:1. The acting was awesome! The characters in this movie were OWNED by the actors... Sean Penn made a better performance than in Mystic River, Benicio del Toro really made me feel for his character, and Naomi Watts did well, it's the first movie I've seen her in.2. The directing was really awesome, it was gritty and in your face, and it really captured the actors and sets honestly, there was nothing hollywood about it, it seemed really authentic and real. Not to mention it was directed by a Latino and had an all LATINO crew working on the film. (I'm hispanic so I had to give props, lol)3. I was really impressed by the way the story was told. Lazy minded people are the only ones that wouldn't understand the plotline. I mean c'mon the entire movie flows so GORGEOUSLY this is where this movie REALLY shines! They didn't just film the movie and then jumble it into out of order sequences, it honestly plays out correctly and you figure things out just fine.4. The score for this movie is so effing moving, I just love it, yummy.I just really loved this movie and I thought I should express it. :)",21 Grams
434,replyhouse,Gets old fast,3,2 April 2004,"Once you become accustomed to the time jumps in this movie, it gets very mundane and easy to see what's coming. I am appalled that this dreck is in imdb's top 250 at the time of this writing.None of the characters are particularly deep. While I felt some sympathy or empathy for a few of them now and again, by the end I really did not care about them at all and just want the credits to roll.Benicio del Toro does his usual solid job as a struggling ex-con. I am not a big fan of Sean Penn; he meanders through another role here, never really giving the viewer insight into his character. Naomi Watts is ok in most scenes, a little over the top here and there. Most of the rest of the cast could have been replaced with mannequins or other props and it would have been difficult to tell the difference.Bottom line: 21 Grams is dull; spend your money on something else.",21 Grams

Benicio Del Toro's performance though I was repulsed by his actions I felt a true sympathy and empathy for his character.  The torment at the hands of his children, his son confirming that his father, his idol, was a murderer. His betrayal by God, left there and forsaken.  A Test that no mortal could endure.  Living on his own with his own demons, eating away at his soul. And the true irony  of the whole situation the man who benefited from Benicio Del Toro's heinous act is tormented and feels the guilt and the spirit of the murdered husband.",21 Grams
436,BrainDamageEclipse,"Not a masterpiece, but viewable...",7,3 May 2004,"I have just watched '21 grams' and, well... it's not a masterpiece, but it is viewable. It surely desires one viewing, and may require a second one, if you want to really taste the story in every little detail. (I may just consider myself a second view of it, but not very soon, anyway...)In the beginning (the first 15 or 20 minutes or so) the movie is hard to watch, because the 3 narrative threads are mixed together, and leaps are made forward and backward in time. But when one starts to get the main idea (who's who), one may relax a bit. In the end it gets a little predictable and boring (sorry). And it's a little too long to watch (2 hours and some).I will give it a 6.5 out of 10 (I've seen better).___SPOILERS BELOW___The plot is quite simple, but is complicated by breaking it into little pieces, that are presented in a non-chronological order. Basically the plot is this (in chronological presentation): Michael (Danny Huston) and Cristina (Naomi Watts) are the average american couple with two little girls and a happy quiet life. Jack (Benicio Del Toro) is an ex-con, now settled down, who became very religious, but has trouble in keeping jobs because of his tattoos. He is also married and has two children (a boy and a girl). Paul (Sean Penn) is a mathematician (?) with a very acute heart disease, who is dying because of this disease. His ex-wife (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is coming back to take care of him, but she wants to have a baby with him (although artificial insemination seems the only way), because she believes that this is the way to get close to him again and to make him live on, when he'll be dead. Those 3 separate stories mix up one day when Michael and his daughters are coming home and Jack accidentally hits them with his car, killing them. Jack first runs off from the place of the accident, but later, in spite of her wife's implorations, and although there are no witnesses to identify him as the doer, he gives himself up. Cristina starts taking drugs, in hope that this will kill her pain, and agrees to donate the heart of her late husband. Paul gets this heart. Paul wants to know the name of the donator, but hospital's rules are strongly against it. So Paul hires a detective to find out the name. And so he finds out the story of Cristina and of her dead husband and daughters. Paul approaches Cristina, at first not telling her that he is the one with Michael's heart, and as he gets more acquainted with Cristina, he gets more cold with his wife (Paul is disappointed when he finds out that his wife, at a certain point, when they first broke up, aborted their unborn child). In the end Paul and Cristina become lovers. After Jack comes out of the prison, Cristina asks Paul (now that he has Michael's heart, his place and that he 'f***s his wife') to kill him. Paul tries, but cannot do it (out of weakness). Since in the mean time the doctors said that he will die anyway, even with this new heart, he tries to commit suicide. He shots himself, but not mortally. Cristina and Jack take him to the hospital, and Jack - still feeling guilty - assumes the shot. He is released, because the police cannot verify that he is the shooter (which he is not). In the end Paul dies in the hospital. He has a final meditation, just before his last breath, where he reveals the 'secret' of the movie: when you die, your body loses 21 grams in weight (soul's weight?). And he wonders about the meaning of these 21 grams (what we gain by losing them?), and of life, in general.I don't know if chopping up the plot was really necessary. It gets much more complicated that in, say, 'Pulp Fiction', and the technique seems (here, _not_ in 'Pulp Fiction', too), quite artificial. Maybe if they made it more 'philosophical', if they pushed more on the elements used in the final (Paul's meditation), it would have been more interesting. 'Fight Club', which is one of my favorite recent movies, does this. In '21 grams' they preferred the action, and the plot, to the idea and the thought. Pity!",21 Grams
437,markfcline,"Very powerful, thought provoking, outstanding movie.",9,29 May 2004,"I am typically an action movie fan and not often does a drama catch my attention but this one did. I was caught up in the story from the opening scene and by the end of the movie I was sobbing. This movie really touched me. My emotions really welled up and had to be released by movies end. This is definitely a must see movie. Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro were outstanding. This is an Oscar caliber movie and both Penn and Del Toro deserve a nomination. This script was well written and executed even better. Kudos to Arriaga on taking a storyline that has been presented before, but not as well as he has done. His storyline keeps you on the edge, interested and anticipating the outcome. At times I was confused, but he did a marvelous job tying it all together at the end. I highly recommend this movie.",21 Grams

Although quite confusing at first, with multiple timeliness to contend with, it begins to clear up and track well and from that point on prepare yourself for one of the most emotionally drenching thrillers you're perhaps to ever see. Well worth patience in the beginning. Sean Penn is mesmerizing as usual in his portrayal of a man bent on discovery and battling a fatal illness and Naomi Watts is shockingly convincing as the wife/mother facing the ultimate loss and dealing with the aftermath. Bionici DelTorro is at his usual best as the burnt-out, ex-con who just found Jesus and is now facing something that shakes the foundations of his new found faith. The directing is spot-on and the cinematography haunting and spell-binding.",21 Grams
439,Tom_Ryan,Surprisingly great,8,5 January 2005,"21 Grams looks like a European independent classic : weird, good, intense. It's an experience you have to live. After watching it, you feel like you're older because you've just gone through some ""emotionally-strong events"".Those events have a powerful impact on you because of the way it is shot. The realism catches your eyes and there's nothing else to do but to have compassion (especially for Naomi Watts' character).The actors are brilliant, special mention to Watts who is simply breathtaking. She's one of the few actresses who can make me cry (she deserves an Oscar for that...).The story is simple but intense. In reality, the strength of the movie is in the unconventional editing. It's a puzzle : we go back and forth in time. It's like a game.Some people may find it kind of annoying or confusing.For me, it was intriguing, the director was just catching my attention. When you are given pieces of information, you just want to figure it out. Anyway, I guess he wanted us to be as lost as his characters...Finally, it's a little hard to watch this movie but easy to feel it. Just be patient, focus on the facts, try to discover the truth then you will be rewarded with one of the most original and emotional movie of the latest years.",21 Grams

However, I was quite disappointed. Actually, I was very disappointed. For the first thirty minutes when the actions of the film were shown as small snippets of film, I found myself hoping that this would stop and it was only like this for the opening credits. When it didn't stop, I found myself gradually getting used to it. Penn and Del Toro were amazing in the film. I felt for Del Toro and hoped things would be OK for him. Although Watts is an amazing actress, in this film the character she was portraying was irritating and self-obsessed and quite frankly, a horrible person. If she had been granted less screen time, i might have found the film more enjoyable. I also found the story hard to relate to, which wasn't helped by the jittery directing. I have spoke to others though, who have thoroughly enjoyed the film. Myself and my boyfriend (who fell asleep!) didn't.",21 Grams
441,phillipellis,Getting to the heart of the matter.,7,14 February 2005,"21 Grams! Must be another slick drugs movie right, not so, apparently that's the amount of bodyweight lost the moment we die; but is it the soul, or something else that leaves the body in a hurry. This intelligent complex drama that's hard to follow at times puts the case for both and what better way to tell this tapestry of intrigue than leaving it in the hands of the excellent Sean Penn and Naomi Watts. With a run time of 160 minutes though and more twists than a James Bond cocktail its best not to watch it with the girlfriend or the misses, guys :>.A Penn movie had already scored a nomination for this years Oscars with the over rated film version of the book in' Mystic River'. But it was his performance here in this intriguing drama by the director of the superb Mexican film in 'Amores Perres' that earn't both of them an Oscar nomination that has put Americas finest method actor back on top. The emerging Watts also puts in a cracking turn as the bereaved young wife and Benicio Del Torro,the cheap mans Brad Pitt, also does the business as the blue collar ex con going straight in what for me is a film that's going into my top ten of the year.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>THE PLOT<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Reformed ex con, Jordan Jarr (Del Torro) is just trying to go straight with the help of Jesus and a lack of booze to bring up his young family. Paul Harris (Penn) is lying on a hospital bed awaiting, as yet, an unspecified operation in the arms of his English girlfriend. Laura'. Christine (Watts), a busy suburban housewife, married to an architect, is preparing her young daughters birthday party in their comfortable middle class home. But a tragic event is about to entwine all their lives in the way no one wanted or expected.We then learn what operation Paul's having and how the event came about through a series of Pulp Fiction style plot hops, a tactic also used by director Alejandro Gonzalez in his previous work. Paul's girl Laura wants a baby through proxy by sperm donation if the procedure goes wrong whilst the doner is increasingly distracted by his own mortality as we again flash back, and forward, to find out why he's in different states of health throughout the film. But it's his empathy for the architect's wife's situation that really unwinds the films intriguing tapestry as we are slowly given the remaining pieces to the puzzle. By then the viewer understands the different characters torment, completing a memorable piece of film making when the final thread woven in reveals all. ""So many things have to happen for two people to meet and fall in love. If that acquaintance happens whilst one person is somewhere they don't want to be then the other must realise that they wouldn't have met if they weren't where they were"".>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>THE RESULT<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Where as Mystic River was over rated this is seriously underplayed and a cracking piece of cinema for Penn. The Italian American just has that ability to wear his emotions and pain on the face like no other and at times becomes De'Niro and Brando on demand. The movies is put together exquisitely so you have no real idea what its about early on and then everything becomes intriguing as the journey develops and your misconceptions tidied up.It's very much an acting led movie set in the correct context of the daily grind and routine and how we are all destined by other people's actions. It just has that real stamp of gritty realism that we go to the cinemas to escape in our everyday life and it seems to express just how fragile life is and how it can end so suddenly, destroying many other lives and families. I really do recommend this to any fans of seriously intelligent and engaging film that's not going to patronise you with obvious hints and obsequious endings.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>EXTRAS<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<A look behind the scenes is pretty good stuff as the exciting Mexican director in Alejandro Gonzalez tells us all about this intriguing story and how he went about putting the story on screen. As a committed Catholic he seems fascinated with death, and if there's life after it; whether the soul does go on to another plane.",21 Grams

Unfortunately I'm sorry to say that I cannot say the same about Benicio del Toro, who plays a central role in the plot. In the opening scene Jack Jordan (del Toro) attempts to straighten out a youngster.

446,tntran,Rather annoying at the beginning and completely disappointing at the end.,4,3 June 2005,"First some positive comments about the movie: The actors and actresses (both lead and support casts) were decent, with realistic portrayals of human weakness and pain. Also, the fragmented, jumping time-line was a device that actually held my attention. If you do not wish to read any negative comments, do not read on: To summarize, this is a depressing movie dealing loss, grieving, revenge, and the struggle with faith from 3 different viewpoints of one interconnected event. Sadly, I cannot say that the movie was either heartrending or poignant. The main reason for this are the characters. First, there is Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) who has a failing heart and needs a heart transplant. From the beginning, who proves himself to be self-destructive: he smokes, risking his chance of staying on a transplant list. OK, he is the lead character, maybe even the ""hero"" of the movie. However, from beginning to end he epitomizes selfishness. Besides the fact that he has a medical problem and wants to help the woman whose husband gave him a new chance at life, he has no other redeeming characters at all. Anyone in who is a transplant patient or in the field knows how priceless a transplanted organ is. The majority of the children and adults die while waiting on the transplant list. So no, anyone who smokes, drinks, and takes illicit drugs to ruin their current organs do NOT deserve transplantation. It is very frustrating when Paul, who continues to drag on those cigarettes post-transplant, yells at Jack Jordan (Benicio del Toro) that he is a murderer. Even at the end, I don't think the character Paul understands that he himself could have been a murderer, by keeping a life saving gift from another deserving candidate. In the rest of the movie, he stalks Christina Peck (Naomi Watts) and has an affair with her (of course, since his wife who remained with him throughout his sickness was such an overbearing character who only stayed with him because she is lonely- absolutely realistic). Christina Peck certainly should be suffering, painfully- she lost both her daughters and her supportive husband in one sudden blow. Her instinct for revenge is not far-fetched. Even her self-destructive grieving is a reflection of what commonly happens in the real-world. But remember this is Hollywood. So when she returns to her drug habits, gets in her vehicle and belligerently damns everyone who tries to help her, she only bumps the car in front, ""...no damage done."" If Innarritu wanted to reflect gripping reality, he should have had her kill 2 innocent boys and their mother. However, responsibility for one's actions should never get in the way of self-absorption in Hollywood movies, so let's move on. Jack Jordan was actually a complex, scarred character trying desperately to figure out the world that leaves him scratching his head in every direction that he turns. I guess I kept on watching the movie to see the outcome of Jack.Without the characters and the fragmented scene device, the plot was stale. At the conclusion of the movie, you sort of shrug your shoulder and say, ""Yeah, life is *expletive"".""",21 Grams
447,danasamsone,"Great movie, wonderful acting",10,31 August 2006,"Definitely one of the best movies I have seen in years. It left me a very powerful impression and most of the people who see it cannot forget it very easy. I love the fact that this movie seems so non-hollywoodian, looking more like an European art movie. The plot is superb and the fact that the happenings are not presented in their chronological order makes it even more impressive. It's almost impossible not to sympathize with the characters, not to mention the fact that Watts, Penn and especially Benicio del Toro are at their best. I made quite a few suppositions until I realized, after the first 30- 40 minutes what was actually going on, but then, the puzzle fits perfectly and you realize that all those hallucinating images make perfect sense, and everything is very realistic, even if, at a certain moment you may experience the feeling that you are watching a David Lynch adaptation of a Kafka book (which would actually be very interesting to see). A film hard to digest by those who go to the cinema just to see light funny movies you can forget the moment you walk out of the room, but a ""must see"" for all the real cinefils, who enjoy an exquisite, total cinematographic experience.",21 Grams
448,Sniff_My_Cologne,My View on 21 Grams,8,3 July 2005,"This movie is definitely one of the best films about death in a long time. A subject i feel that does not get touched on as often as it should in film. Most films that do touch on the subject are usually war films and death in a war is a 'casualty of war', but 21 grams shows the 'casualties of life' so in short this film took a whole new approach. Benicio, Sean, and Naomi where all fantastic, when watching this film i was looking at a screen full of inspiration, and i feel it was some of Benicio's and especially Naomi's best work to date. 21 Grams a film that took a chance with a unique plot and prevailed. A Definite worth the money worth the while purchase. 8/10",21 Grams
449,dragonbait9,Powerful,10,15 June 2019,"This movie was hard to watch and stayed with me for days after. It was exceptionally acted, beautifully shot, and the script kept you enraptured. I'll watch again for sure, I know I missed things while crying.",21 Grams
450,shadowvid,21 grams a sad and slow experience.,7,17 December 2020,"21 grams gives us great perfromances from Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts, it really puts emphasis on every chracter struggles and how they deal with the internal problems they got, but as much as i loved seeing the actors giving their best. I think the linearity of the scenes is what pulled me out of the experience, moving back and forth killing a bit of the momentum, i was able to follow them but they didn't stuck with me as they should've. Overall great movie , i wouldn't recommend it unless you like a lot of drama.",21 Grams
451,PEsteves8,Makes us think in how lucky we are,9,24 December 2005,"I never thought it would be possible to join so many sad events in just one movie. It makes us think in how lucky we are. Naomi Watts is perfect for her part as you just feel terrible with the fact that such beautiful woman that had it all, suddenly loses everything. The mixed scenes directing makes that you only get to know everything just in the very ending of the movie. It's hard do smile just if for once during this movie. When I got out of the cinema everyone was pale and serious. Although it's very sad, it still can maintain a small amount of hope thus not making a movie that only wants to show disgrace in our world. Extremely well directed, and with stunning acting by both Naomi Watts and Sean Penn.",21 Grams
452,the_bearded_oneder,disjointed nonlinear presentation,7,15 October 2005,"The seven vote is all about the flow of presentation ...During the first 45 minutes a fragmented picture begins to gradually emerge from the puzzling pieces of background presented by the director's non-linear process.After that the plot and time line clear up just enough that the remainder of the tale is comprehensible. Evenso, characters bounce from scene to scene without an immediate understanding of what they are doing or how they arrived there. Rather than setting up each scene, the director delegates the responsibility of deciphering them to you, the viewer.Is this a great movie? In my opinion no. However, if you have 45 minutes worth of patience to follow the disjointed opening, and the attention span to decipher the scene bounce, it does eventually unfold into an above average movie.",21 Grams
