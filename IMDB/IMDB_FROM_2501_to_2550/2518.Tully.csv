0,SnoopyStyle,one minor issue,8,2 August 2018,"Marlo (Charlize Theron) is very pregnant. Her husband Drew (Ron Livingston) spends his spare time playing video games. Her son's tantrums are causing problems at school and they demand she hire an aide for him. After the birth, she is overwhelmed by the new baby. Her wealthy brother Craig (Mark Duplass) casually suggests a night nanny ignoring the costs. The arrival of Tully (Mackenzie Davis) is a salvation and they slowly become more than friends.Charlize is stripped of her Hollywood super gorgeous idolatry. She's great. I wasn't sure with the addition of Tully. It takes one particularly strange turn before it goes full crazy and I bought into it. The reveal is a little muddled and I would subtract Drew's comment about having a night nanny at the hospital. That little comment causes some issues. I'd revise it in a specific way. No matter what, that's a minor bump in an otherwise terrific movie.",Tully
1,Horst_In_Translation,Tully certainly no Dully,6,18 June 2018,"Two years after Clint Eastwood's Sully, ""Tully"" is a new 2018 movie from America and the most recent collaboration between Oscar-nominated director Jason Reitman and Oscar-winning writer Diablo Cody, both around the age of 40 now. And it is also not the first time that Oscar-winning South African actress Charlize Theron plays the main character in a Reitman/Cody film and yes it is true, even if the film's title includes another character who is admittedly a co-lead here. I cannot deny that I am quite a fan of Reitman's works with ""Up in the Air"" being one of the finest and most contemporarily relevant movies of the decade in my opinion, maybe the best film on unemployment that has even been made. But Reitman wrote that one himself and when he lends the pen to Cody, his efforts may not be as top-notch.Still, what we have here is a solid movie in my opinion that is certainly worth seeing. Theron plays the part better than probably pretty much everybody else would have and her dedication, also in terms of weight gain, is admirable. She makes the role her own really quickly. Mackenzie Davis is a fresh face and she is convincing too, even if she definitely does not have the quality and material to shine as much as Theron. The two have pretty good chemistry and as a consequence this relatively short 95-minute movie flies by. The only essential problem I had with it that I can think of right now is probably the inclusion of two key scenes. The first would be how Theron's character gifts Tully to her husband from a sexual perspective. It's never graphic and you cannot be 100% sure if there was intercourse or just stripping leading to ejaculation perhaps, but it felt a bit strange for a married couple and the explanation to spice things up and wake the man's instinct did not feel entirely convincing to me. Yes he loves his wife, but this moment also could have turned him into someone who experiences interest in other women again, not just Tully. And the second scene, that was even working less for me was the mermaid scene at the end. I assume the protagonist was just hallucinating somehow here, but then she still got out of the car, so she cannot have lost her senses or consciousness. This is really where the film tries to be too much in terms of significance and the impact it is trying to make. I don't think we would have seen that with Reitman penning the story.But well, these minor flaws should not take anything away from the pretty good character study the film is most of the time. It's a good watch with your parents, your significant other or your family in general, maybe your kids not so much. Also real greatness is missing aside from an occasional pretty good Theron moment. Livingston was good too and so were the two who played the brother and his wife. But it's not a movie that will make a huge impact come awards season, also because it simply misses moments of true greatness or something like the contemporarily significant story parts I mentioned earlier that somehow feel like they have an impact on society overall. The release is also not perfect and will destroy Theron's chances who could have been there for some nominations at least had the film been released half a year later. But this should not keep you from watching it. I think it is very much worth seeing, especially for the dialogs between the characters and basically everybody's acting from start to finish. If your wife is pregnant, especially with her second child or so, then you are almost obliged to check this one out with her. Don't miss out here. I give it a thumbs-up of course. A really rock-solid mix of comedy and drama.",Tully
2,kosmasp,Grow up,9,31 August 2018,"Phenomenal performance by Charlize Theron once again. And a story to hold it all together. You may know where this is heading (morality or just plain story wise), I didn't, but I don't think this will impact how much you will like this. So well played and if you like a drama that depicts a certain issue very well, you could do worse but not much better in the overall package department.Well directed and shot, well scripted, this gives us an insight into the mind of a person that might not be ready yet. And I would argue that most know that feeling. Some can work better with it others less so. It's really a rollercoast ride and one that while I wouldn't call entertaining generally speaking, it does hold a lot of light moments. Which is quite the achievement and also necessary if you think about all the moments that might feel like they drag on ... the pacing is key and it works, if you let it",Tully
3,oscaralbert,This flick cleverly avoids the need to pay . . .,10,17 May 2018,". . . any sort of rights fees to the WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN folks, by changing a few minor details about that 2011 ""T. Swinton"" vehicle. Despite fiddling with the names of some characters, and moving the filming location from the U.S. homeland to Canada (where there's apparently NO street that resembles Brooklyn, NY, in the least), it's plain as water that ""C. Theron"" is playing the Swinton mom character during this KEVIN prequel, ""R. Livingston"" is portraying the doomed serial-killer enabling neglectful husband\dad, and that ""Jonah"" has an extended role as the kindergarten-age ""Kevin"" briefly seen during the 2011 movie. In the past decade or two, many if not most of the notorious Real Life school shooters have evinced the symptoms that TULLY nails to a ""T"" with Jonah. In a brilliant casting move, Ms. Theron--who's already garnered one of the coveted Gelded Statuettes as the title serial killer in MONSTER--reprises her role, adding additional layers of schizophrenic scariness to her award-winning performance. ""With moms like (Ms. Theron's) Marlo, who needs enemies?"" TULLY asks. In one of TULLY's most compelling scenes, Marlo gets all PSYCHO at Jonah's ""St. Vitus School."" Since St. Vitus syndrome is the medical term for Dancing Death Disease, this episode seems to be telegraphing a sequel in which an older Jonah dispenses with Kevin's arrow affectation, and uses the more traditional assault rifle to make the future students and staff of the school which expelled him perform their own Dance of Death.",Tully
4,george.schmidt,Funny and well-conceived dramedy with Theron in top form,8,5 May 2018,"TULLY (2018) *** Charlize Theron, Mackenzie Davis, Ron Livingston, Mark Duplass, Elaine Tan, Maddie Dixon-Poirer, Asher Miles Fallica. Funny and well-conceived dramedy with Theron in top form as a frazzled mother who's third birth results in having her well-meaning brother Duplass hiring a 'night nanny' (Davis in a skillful turn) to help her decompress. Diablo Cody's spot-on dialogue driven screenplay is a corker and reuniting with director Jason Reitman continues to blend the mired miserable with the life-affirming joy. While the final act is kind of a let-down it ultimately is solid in portraying the constant juggle/struggle of adulthood and parenting.",Tully
5,neil-476,Entertaining if a little away from the mainstream,8,11 May 2018,"Marlo is somewhat frazzled. With her 3rd (and unplanned) child arriving, her 6-year old undiagnosed on the autirm spectrum, and her husband somewhat disconnected from her day-to-day issues and emotional wellbeing, her wealthy brother pays for a night nanny to make sure she doesn't suffer from sleep exhaustion. After initial resistance, Marlo finds Tully incredibly supportive. But is all as it seems.With Diablo Cody writing and Jason Reitman directing, you could get something terrific (Juno) or a bit of a misfire (Young Adult). Tully contains elements of both.Cody nails everyday pressures and the hassles of parenthood, particularly the stresses and fatigues arising from having a new baby. Charlize Theron, in another physically unflattering performance, convinces as Marlo - many parents will recognise her.The story is somewhat ragged. The thread of the son's autism, initially significant, never really goes anywhere. And Tully's secret, gradually teased at, has a great reveal, but seems to belong to another movie.I enjoyed this, albeit I'm not sure it turned out to be what I was expecting when it started.",Tully
6,evanston_dad,Never Quite Gels,6,16 November 2018,"Tully is the name of a night nanny, a sort of nocturnal Mary Poppins who shows up after dark to take over for beleaguered mom of three Charlize Theron. The pressures of motherhood have brought Theron to her wits' end, and what she needs more than anything is a good night's sleep. Tully lets her have that, and then allows her to have even more, and through her help Theron regains some of the youth and vigor she forfeited for family life.Who exactly is Tully? Where does she come from? What's her story? The movie does eventually tell us in a plot twist that's disappointingly predictable. The whole movie is disappointing really, but it didn't have to be. Writer Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman, who brought ""Juno"" to the screen, tantalize us with hints of magical realism, making it only that much more of a let down when those hints prove to be red herrings. ""Tully"" is yet another movie about adults who can't adjust to their own decisions and forego enjoying the life they have for the life they're convinced they've lost. I don't have a lot of patience with stories like this, and the same goes for ""Tully.""I really like Charlize Theron as an actress, but for some reason I don't like her in Jason Reitman movies. Their other partnership, ""Young Adult,"" was also a test of patience, asking the audience to stick around long enough for Theron's caustic, juvenile character to grow up. In ""Tully,"" she doesn't play a bad person, but she does play an awfully off putting one. The problem is, she doesn't become more likable or relatable as she loosens up, though we're clearly supposed to think she does. And add this to the list of movies that patly and cleanly tie a bow on mental illness and suggest that if everyone just wakes up one morning and decides to try harder everything will be magically better. It doesn't work that way.Grade: B-",Tully
7,ferguson-6,just don't call it quirky,8,4 May 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody first collaborated on the filming of her debut script JUNO in 2007. Four years later they made YOUNG ADULT with Charlize Theron, and now all three reunite for this latest tip of the cap to motherhood and self-care. Simpatico is the word that comes to mind here with the perfect lineup of writer, director and actress. The biggest question is how to label it. Some will call it a comedy, while others will proclaim it a serious drama. As with much of life, there is a bit of laughter, a touch of drama, and a dash of most every emotion.Ms. Theron stars as Marlo, mother of three. There is 8/9 year old daughter Sarah (Lia Frankland, 6 year old son Jonah (Asher Miles Fallica) who lands on the autistic spectrum, and now an unplanned newborn that threatens to rock a family already barely getting through each day. Sarah is a lovely sister and daughter, but the typical adolescent insecurities are magnified by her getting lost in the shuffle due to her two more needy siblings. Jonah gets booted from mainstream kindergarten by a principal who labels him ""quirky"" ... an awkward description people use when they are trying to be polite (even though it's exactly the opposite). Ron Livingston plays Marlo's husband Drew, a traveling businessman who, though a nice guy and loving father, is clueless to the stresses of running the homestead. Also in the mix is Craig (Mark Duplass), Marlo's brother who is equal parts wealthy and smug. When Craig offers the gift of a night-nanny to Marlo, she is tempted, but her pride gets in the way as she compares herself to the 'cupcake' super moms who always seem to have their act together. Ultimately, the relentless pressure and sleep deprivation, bring the young night-nanny Tully (Mackenzie Davis) into the home. She and Marlo hit it off immediately leading Marlo (and us) to question if Tully is too good to be true.As Tully entrenches herself, it becomes clear that her value is to Marlo more than the baby. The two ladies become friends, and Marlo confesses her fears and insecurities as Tully acts as a life coach encouraging her through some tough moments. Despite the surreal feel to these interactions, Diablo Cody's dialogue crackles with cynicism and realism. The quips we've come to expect from her writing are delivered by her best developed character to date. There is a depth to Marlo, and her exchanges with Tully take us places a teenage JUNO couldn't possibly.Charlize Theron proves again that she is truly an elite actress when she commits to a role. Her 50 lb weight game adds the necessary realism, but it's her emotional teetering that is most impressive. She is like a supermodel who also plays rugby - a rare blend of beauty, talent and skill. Mackenzie Davis is a revelation. She holds her own in every scene and it's quite interesting to see her free-spirited modern day Mary Poppins with tats.If a previous movie has dealt with the challenge and stress of motherhood with this level of depth and realism, it doesn't come to mind. The movie kind of creeps up on you with a message regarding the importance of dealing with lost youth, while also never losing sight of yourself as an individual ... all with incisive humor and pulling no punches on being an overwhelmed mom. Just don't call it quirky.",Tully
8,phd_travel,Interesing topic but some silly things happen. About 50 percent worth watching.,5,5 August 2018,I'll watch anything Charlize Theron does so I am on her side. This movie is interesting in it's depiction of the difficulty of tending to a new baby and running a household with other young kids. The night nanny thing is illuminating to watch. But the drama at the end is contrived and unnecessary. The accident could have been clearer. Also the thing with the waitress uniform and the husband is really dumb.A for effort from Charlize to be that overweight mom but it can't be good for her health to gain weight like that. If they needed a heavier actress for the role why didn't they just use one who was already like that.,Tully
9,siderite,"A tour de force for Theron, but a sensitive subject",8,17 September 2018,"Basically Charlize Theron is acting the hell out of this movie, with all the other actors except Mackenzie Davis in supporting roles. It's about a mother of two having a third child and having difficulties dealing with the stress and overwork. The husband is nice, but uninvolved, the brother is nice, but condescending, there is no one else to help her than a ""night nanny"", a person who's job is to take care of the child while the mother gets to sleep. Polluted by scores of movies with psychotic nannies, I was expecting all kinds of nasty things to happen. It's not one of those movies. In fact, in the end a lot of the scenes that were kind of weird become clear. Can't tell you move for fear of spoiling it, but I urge you to pay attention to everything; it will be satisfying in the end. Not all is rosy, though. Most of the beginning of the film is shouting and screaming children that would put to shame Durex commercials. The subject might be sensitive for people that consider having children or are in a stressful period of their lives for having made a decision one way or the other. I loved Charlize's acting, I liked the concept and I liked how the movie was crafted. I recommend it.",Tully
10,namashi_1,A (Minor) Delight!,7,10 May 2018,"Director Jason Reitman returns to true form with 'Tully'. The talented director who hit a few lows with his 2 previous outings, is back with force in this interesting & engaging tale on Motherhood, Mental Illness & Life, itself. And Reitman's teaming with Writer Diablo Cody, this being their fourth together, proves victorious, once again. This is the kinda film, that has a simple storyline, but its Writing & Treatment, make it engrossing & even, despite a few minuses, memorable.'Tully' Synopsis: A mother of three hires a night nanny to help with her newborn.'Tully' isn't about Tully, even though the title belongs to her. This is the story Marlo (a sterling performance by Charlize Theron) , a wife & a mother of three, who's going through postpartum depression & is simply, done being mommy all the time, round the clock. So, things get much better when a night nanny named Tully (a star-making performance by Mackenzie Davis) shows up & gives Marlo her much needed peace. And that's all I'm gonna tell you about this story. Where it goes after Marlo & Tully meet, is something that demands to be witnessed. And while there some flabby bits here, the overall result of its storytelling, is strong on merit.Cody's Screenplay is truly well-done. It tackles a relatable & affecting circumstance & turns into a ride, with some very clever turns. Having said that, the Writing isn't always on-point & gets a little monotonous, especially towards the middle, but picks up rapidly again to a startling finish. But yes, the Writing could've been a little tighter in the middle portions. Reitman is fine form this time. The Director commands the narrative with precision. Cinematography & Editing are good. Art & Costume Design are top-notch.Performance-Wise: Charlize Theron is in top-form, yet again. Her portrayal of Marlo, a woman in desperate need of help & rest, is pure acting magic. Theron, who did wonders with Reitman & Cody in Young Adult years ago, triumphs once again with 'Tully'. Theron is one of the finest actresses working in the planet today & 'Tully' proves that fact right, for the umpteenth time. Mackenzie Davis is absolutely lovable as Tully. The actress stands on her own, despite sharing space with Theron. She has the potential to make it big. Ron Livingston is excellent as Marlo's husband & Mark Duplass scores as Marlo's brother. Others lend remarkable support.On the whole, 'Tully' deserves a watch, for sure! Strongly Recommended!",Tully
11,blanbrn,A touching emotional drama of friendship and being a team member of the family.,7,5 May 2018,"""Tully"" is one of those movies as you watch you feel emotion, pain, and drama as it's clear that all can form friendships and bond together when least expected.

And the breast feeding is no pie job!

12,lasttimeisaw,"The ""almost"" return of a prodigal son",7,2 September 2018,"After his one-two punch Oscar contenders JUNO (2007) and UP IN THE AIR (2009), Jason Reitman has racked up 4 Oscar nominations (including two for the prestigious BEST DIRECTOR laurels) by the age of 33, far runs rings around his father, Hollywood journeyman Ivan Reitman. However, the honeymoon period end precipitously, YOUNG ADULT (2011) can still keep its head above water, but the absolutely abysmal reception from both LABOR DAY (2013) and MEN, WOMEN & CHILDREN (2014), keeps prompting cineasts that head-scratching question: what has happened to this America's boy genius?Here comes TULLY, the second collaboration between him, Diablo Cody (writer of JUNO) and Charlize Theron, the triangle force behind YOUNG ADULT, Theron plays Marlo Moreau, a 40-ish mother-of-three, enmeshed in the toil of child-bearing and stricken with postpartum stress after her recent parturition. Out of blue, her life miraculously gets a new lease from a nocturnal baby-minder, the titular Tully (Davis), a modern Mary Poppin materializes only at night to bring her life back on track, but Reitman keeps nudging us that something is amiss, not least that weird threesome with Drew (Livingston), Marlo's shiftless husband. The husband, under such circumstances, is often prone to receive the short end of the stick, and for the sake of accomplishing the story's central subterfuge, it seems that Reitman and Cody has no option but to shoehorn Drew as a cavalier father who promptly snuggles into bed every night before 10:30 to play video games, regardless of a worn-out wife lingering downstairs (or curiously enough to check on the night nanny), thus secures the requisite that he never meets Tully without Marlo's presence (at least to audience's reception), as a result, he is portrayed as a character error on the side of insouciance and insensitivity, but Cody's script is too sober to demonize this male prototype - yes even his fetish is old-fashion and squeaky-proper, a 50s diner waitress uniform - also by virtue of Ron Livingston's hangdog amicability, a thorny gender politics doesn't go off the rail. A spitfire Charlize Theron undertakes an even more eye-popping physical transmogrification than her Oscar-bagging turn in MONSTER (2003), reportedly putting on an elephantine 50 pounds and often slouching miserably and frustratedly in the incarnation of the most horrific nightmare, that could ever happen to any nubile girls craving for motherhood down the line, c'est la vie, behind our over-populated planet, there are gazillions of suffering mothers, taking it on themselves to the albatross diurnally, one must gives the film its credit to flag up the epidemic whose clinical diagnosis still remains moot in practice. Theron sheds every single molecule of celebrity glamor to inhabit Marlo's lifelikeness with gusto and agency, stimulatingly connects with a feisty Mackenzie Davis, to pull the wool over viewers' eyes, there is sparkling frankness in their self-reflective inspection about a woman's choice of their other half and what fulfillment means, nothing too progressive (especially gauged by Cody's more liberal bent), yet it is somewhat therapeutic, as the ending cunningly hints. Out of its run-of-the-mill contemporary milieu, Reitman stages a fantastical coup-de-maître with Marlo's figment where a mermaid swimming against a cerulean palette, which pays off in the money shot when the whole Marlo-Tully interrelationship reaches its breaking point, although it is a bit too corny to achieve that through a DUI car accident, the bottom line is: Reitman finally bottoms out, with his Hugh Jackman's star vehicle THE FRONT RUNNER (2018) on the horizon, one might hazard, next round, the prodigal son (almost) returns.",Tully
13,Hellmant,A pretty serious and depressing look at motherhood!,8,11 May 2018,"'TULLY': Four Stars (Out of Five)A comedy-drama starring Charlize Theron as a mother of three (including a newborn baby) who is gifted a young nanny by her brother. The story focuses on the two women's relationship. It was directed by Jason Reitman, and it was written by Diablo Cody; the two previously worked together (in the same duties) on 2011's 'YOUNG ADULT' (also starring Theron) and 2007's 'JUNO'. The movie also costars Mackenzie Davis, Ron Livingston and Mark Duplass. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics so far, and I enjoyed it as well. Marlo (Theron) is an emotionally struggling and overworked mother of three, including a newborn baby. Her husband, Drew (Livingston), is also very busy with work, and he's unable to help with the kids at all (or so he says). Marlo's brother, Craig (Duplass), offers to pay for a night nanny for the children, so that Marlo can get some more rest. Marlo is at first very resistant to the idea, but she eventually gives in to it. Once she meets the nanny, named Tully (Davis), a very unusual relationship develops between the two women. The movie is a pretty serious and depressing look at motherhood, and getting older. There is some optimism in it, but ultimately it's pretty gloomy. The film also has a pretty surprising twist at the end, and some insightful commentary on sleep depravation and mental illness (two serious issues that I often battle with regularly as well). Theron gives another great performance in it too. Overall I'd say the movie is really well made and effective. It's not as fun or entertaining as 'JUNO' or 'YOUNG ADULT' though.",Tully
14,thesar-2,Breast Milk: The Movie,7,3 September 2018,"If I told you what this drama mimics, it would ruin the whole movie. And after just seeing it, the twist almost did.So, yeah, being as vague as possible there so not to ruin it for anyone else. Suffice to say, I really liked 90% of Tully.Sarcastic, depressed and worn-out mother of two with another on the way, debates on accepting a gift of a Night-Nanny. After several impatient moments with her middle child with obvious, but never spoken, autism, she agrees to accept the help. What follows is a series of nights where the new nanny brings sparks back into the mom's life and things are going great again.The movie is a nice piece of reality and Charlize can really do no wrong. I absolutely believe she'll become a legend and go down in history books about movies as one of the greats. Is this movie great? Not really, but it's pretty engaging despite it being so realistic. The cast is great, it was well filmed, acted and the dialogue felt both real and funny at times. One could argue this wasn't just lifted from someone's life.Ahhh, but here's the age-old question: Is this movie worth spending a ton of money at the movies or just renting/watching on Netflix? The latter is true. It's definitely not a Lifetime® Television for Woman® movie as it even jokes about in the actual film. But, it's just a ""at-home, wow, that was good"" movie.Just forget the twist! That was foreseen, dumb and unnecessary. It also reminded me of one of my favorite French Horror Movies that gave me high tension and had the same moronic twist.***Final thoughts: And movie, thanks for reminding me, once again, why I don't ever want kids. I don't have 1% of the patience needed. Whew! It's just exhausting seeing this movie and makes me glad about my decision.",Tully
15,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Amidst the big-budget blockbusters, superheroes and CGI is a mother.",7,7 May 2018,"'Tully (2018)' is a rare, honest and ultimately heartfelt look at motherhood that isn't afraid to point its lens at the darker side of bringing life into the world. It picks a perspective so often ignored in film, managing to be a downbeat and uplifting experience all at once, and portrays it brilliantly, with a funny wit piercing through the sometimes savage 'truth' plaguing this very flawed character. Some third-act revelations seem to come from left field, 'cheat' slightly and also cause some slight, unintended character casualties (figuratively speaking), though. These do come as a generally genuine surprises (up until a few moments prior, and even then I didn't think they'd actually go there) and they also kind of make me want to re-watch the entire piece. In this way, they do their job, tying together the narrative in a strangely life-affirming and finally hopeful way. These final moments also further push the flick's determination to examine the very real things the film industry tends not to focus on. Its in these areas that the piece finds its real strength and, on occasion, beauty. Amidst the blockbusters, superheroes and CGI is life's most important and universal thing: a mother. 7/10",Tully
16,ThomasDrufke,Genuine,8,8 May 2018,"I highly recommend trying out the tactic of not knowing anything going into a film and seeing everything play out on screen freshly. I did just that with Tully, and it was quite the refreshing experience. Directed by Jason Reitman and starring Charlize Theron, Tully is a uniquely genuine film about the tremendous amount of hardships a mother goes through on a day to day basis, all while making it look easy for the rest of us. It will be a controversial one for sure, because of a few specific directions the film takes (bold ones I may add), but ultimately it succeeds in the hands of Reitman and Theron, who truly add a high level of honesty to a project that needs an audience to feel the humanity in Theron's Marlo. In short, Tully may be one of those great summer films that ends up getting forgot about come Oscar time, a la The Big Sick.8.2/10",Tully
17,MLDinTN,what's real and what's not...,7,24 January 2019,"That's what you should ask yourself when watching this movie. I thought it was pretty good and had a twist that I could guess. Marlo is a mom of 2 expecting a third. Her son most likely has some form of undiagoised autism. She is very stressed out after having the third kid and her son's school wants to dismiss him. Her brother suggests a night nanny and gives her a phone number. After more stress and being so tired, she calls the nanny. What doesn't make sense is why the husband doesn't come down to meet the nanny on her first night. I thought that was very weird, but later it all makes sense. The nanny, Tully, cleans up and even makes cupcakes, and listens to Marlo. Marlo is getting more sleep at night and feeling better. One night, Tully says she has to quit and Marlo goes with her to the city to a bar on the last night. They get drunk and Marlo crashes her van in a river, but some how gets out. That's when we learn Tully was Marlo's maiden name and her vision of her younger self. There was no nanny coming over and Marlo was making it all up in her mind. What I didn't get is why did her husband never ask to meet the nanny or inquire how much she earned? Also was the whole conversation Marlo had with her brother about the nanny real, did he give her a real phone number?FINAL VERDICT: An interesting drama that's not the same ole same old. I recommend it.",Tully

19,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,1 August 2018,"TullyThe best thing about having a nanny is they get all the flak from the mommy shamers at the playground.Mind you, the mommy in this dramedy would just be happy with some shuteye.A middle-age mother of two, Marlo (Charlize Theron), is straddled with an unplanned pregnancy and an inattentive husband (Ron Livingston). Unable to cope with the lack of sleep, Marlo hires a young night nanny, Tully (Mackenzie Davis), to tend to her babe while she rests. Auspiciously, Marlo and Tully share similar viewpoints which help Marlo get through her post-partum slump. But Tully is not exactly who she seems.Saved by an out of left field third act, this honest but sluggish portrayal of modern motherhood and marriage has its merits beyond the strong acting and twist-ending, but they're mostly all depressing.And, as with every nanny, you'll eventually have to fight them for your child's love.

20,westsideschl,Weight Gain Instead of Prosthetics?,8,14 August 2018,"Reader most likely already knows what the movie's about, so.
Positives: 
(1.) That Charlize would gain fifty pounds to make the character is way beyond duty. Fooled me, I thought it was very good prosthetics - and would have been healthier for her. 
(2.) Script topic was unusual, but important. Well written, and well acted by all. The lack of discussion about pro help was not important as most low income and/or educated and/or rural persons that's not an easy viable option. 
Negatives: 
(1.) As seems to be the norm in movies that show teachers and administrators they are portrayed as self-centered, unknowing, little caring, few scarifies, dumpkoffs. Still the stereotype. 
(2.) Tully was a little too unrealistic in many ways such that at one point I thought she was a mental illness/breakdown imaginary creation of Charlize's character. But, enjoyable whether real or not.",Tully
21,851222,Truthful and nice movie to see it once,7,11 October 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Tully"" (2018) isn't Jason Reitman's best movie - far from it. But it was a solid character study drama with some a bit unexpected ending, but to be honest i kinda felt what was going on, therefore it wasn't really a twist. The best things about this movie were solid performances by Charlize Theron, Mackenzie Davis and Ron Livingston. Script was solid and the story was truthful. Many moms will find this movie very true.Overall, ""Tully"" is a solid movie to see it once. Its true to life and that was its strong side, and a bit of letdown maybe at the same time, as we see these things every day, and sometimes you just don't want to see it on a screen as well. Yet a nice movie to see it once.",Tully
22,cruise01,Great performances and a theme about family life.,8,2 August 2018,"Tully (4 out of 5 stars).Tully is a comedy drama film that shows the raw concept of a relationship between a mother and their children. Tully is good. Charlize Theron gives one of the best performances. Of course, she gained weight for the role. Seeing her closing her eyes in a car while her child is screaming and kicking her seat. Like she is about to snap was incredible. The film is like a modern day Mary Poppins, were a night nanny comes and makes everything all better. The plot was good. Marlo (Charlize Theron) is a mother of two and pregnant with the third. Her son struggles with a development disorder were he has a mental breakdown when things do not go his way. Or is afraid to flush the public toilet cause it would make a loud noise. The school he goes too. The principle is trying to inform Marlo that they need to hire him an aid. Since the teacher cannot focus on just him when they have other kids to teach. And their daughter is a reasonable child that tries to help her mother. When Marlo has her baby. She barely has time for herself. She barely gets any sleep, tries to get chores, and take the kids to school and face against a meeting with the principle everytime. Her husband Drew (Ron Livingston) is busy with work and only shows up in the evening and than is busy playing video games. While her brother Craig (Mark Duplass) suggest they hire a night nanny. They hire Tully (Mackenzie Davis). A night nanny that does all the babysitting at night, she does the cleaning, and bakes desserts for the morning. Tully's plot is like one of those life lesson themes. Were Tully suggest that Marlo has it easy. She has the sameness which she takes for granted. While Marlo is missing her earlier years, were her body physique was thin, and she had plenty of energy. Seeing Tully and Marlo sharing their experiences and how one has it better was great. Tully is an interesting character. She has plenty of energy, open spirit perspective on life. Having newborns can be stressful on the parents. It is the most beautiful things in life with the babies growing every day and keeping you up all night. Charlize Theron was fantastic. Seeing her character being exhausted, trying to take care of her kids, and when she sits down at the dinner table. You can see that she is exhausted mentally and physically. Mackenzie Davis was great as Tully. She is like the modern day Mary Poppins. She is always cheery and energetic on life. She is the night nanny that every mother needs. Overall, Tully is a good comedy drama film. Charlize Theron and Mackenzie Davis are great. The plot and concept of the beauty aspect of mothers dealing with newborns and their kids can be raw. But its those small moments that every mother can cherish with the bond and their babies.",Tully
23,eddie_baggins,Theron delivers an awards worthy turn in this confronting look at parenthood and mental illness,7,14 June 2018,"Teaming up for the third time with screenwriting partner Diablo Cody and for the second time with leading lady Charlize Theron, director Jason Reitman has with his parental and mental illness drama Tully sought redemption for some forgettable years behind the camera with the likes of the terrible Labor Day and the little-seen if relatively decent Men, Woman and Children.Much better also than his last Cody/Theron collaboration Young Adult, Tully is a carefully considered and multi-layered examination of Theron's struggling mother of three Marlo, who finds solace and peace with Mackenzie Davis's overnight nanny Tully, who arrives at the right time to stop Marlo from falling off the deep end after her new baby daughter is born.Reitman, who made his name with dramedies Thank You For Smoking, Juno and Up in the Air, is perfectly at home here with Tully's mix of drama and humour, a staple of the Cody screenwriting diet, and Tully is very much a film that doesn't hold back from showing the relatable and often horrific realities of parenthood.Front and centre of these horrors, joys and all that falls in between is Theron as the frail around the edges Marlo, a loving mother and wife to Ron Livingston's Gears of War loving husband Drew and it's a performance that is highly likely to feature come the awards season slog at the end of the year.Devoid of any of the starlet qualities that have seen her become a staple of Hollywood for a number of years, Theron is as raw and nigh on unrecognisable as she's been since her Oscar winning turn in Monster in the early 2000's and she is the key reason as to why Tully succeeds to the level it does.Theron is simply brilliant in her role and whether she's on a seemingly endless diaper changing run or interacting with her newfound friend Tully, Theron is the heart and soul of Reitman's film and come the films later stages, forms an emotional and in many ways confronting character that is one of the best creations of Cody's career and another strong female lead in the directional career of Reitman.With Theron so good it's hard for the rest of the film to match her and while the likes of Livingston and Davis do well in their respective roles, everything else in Reitman's film largely pails in comparison to Theron's committed and memorable turn.Final Say - An honest examination of the potential downfall's of parenthood and also a lovingly crafted look at the joys of the parenting adventure, featuring a surprising and confronting last act, Tully is a return to form for Reitman and Cody and another standout piece of work from Theron who makes Tully more than the sum of its parts.3 ½ nappy changes out of 5",Tully
24,Red-125,Very strange ending,6,2 October 2020,"Tully (2018) was written by Diablo Cody and directed by Jason Reitman.Charlize Theron plays Marlo, a mother of two, who has a third, ""unexpected"" pregnancy. She's already under stress because her son, Jonah is on the autism spectrum. (For whatever reason, no one ever says that he has autism. They say he's, ""quirky."" Is that a new euphemism for the autism spectrum behavior?) Jonah is portrayed by Asher Miles Fallica, who is a brilliant child actor.The basic plot of the story is that Marlo is overwhelmed with the needs of her two older children and the new baby. Her wealthy brother gives her a gift of a ""night nanny."" She arrives in the evening to help Marlo make it through the night. When she leaves in the morning, the house looks great and Marlo has actually gotten some sleep. (Tully is played by Mackenzie Davis, who does a good job.)The plot of the movie is what happens when Mary Poppins arrives in the form of Tully. The rest follows from there.I saw two movies with the same writer (Cody), the same director (Reitman) and the same star (Theron). (The other movie is Young Adult.) There's overlap, especially in the amount of liquor consumed.I just don't think that trio works for me. Tully has a modest IMDb rating of 7.0. I didn't think it was that good, and rated it 6.",Tully
25,TheMovieDiorama,Tully beautifully depicts the challenges and rewards of motherhood.,9,6 May 2018,"Reitman and Cody are back from their previous collaboration 'Juno' to create a simple yet visceral view on parenting and mental illness. Marlo recently gives birth to her third child and is hit with a wave of depression and sleep depravity to which she resorts into employing night nanny Tully. An incredibly basic story that will hardly start a new wave of dramas about pregnancy and motherhood, yet that's part of the alluring charm. The understated plot and the way Reitman executes the narrative just felt fresh, as if watching a cinematic piece of innovation. For him to use Cody's humorous screenplay that eloquently balances wit with philosophical tendencies and then blend it with his personalised directing style was yet another success. The screenplay enables us to emotionally connect with Marlo as a struggling mother who's pride enabled sleep depravity to sneak in and take control of her. Obtaining Theron to be the lead actress was of paramount importance. She. Is. Just. So. Good. I can't quite put into words how phenomenal she is in this. The frustration of parenting, the internal combat of staying awake and the joyous moments of glee, she portrayed every emotion like the majestic acting Goddess that she is. The combination of both the lead performance and the script resulted in a heartwarming illustration of what, I'm sure, most mothers go through. I could feel Marlo's fatigue wearing her down like a child licking an ice lolly, I could sense the inner torment of wanting to just lie down and give up. But as Reitman conveys towards its conclusion, the challenges that arise are met with the rewarding possibilities of caring for another soul. Your own flesh and blood. Your child. The inclusion of Tully in Marlo's current hectic life gave off a sense of relief, a moment to breathe amidst the chaos. The bond between these two characters was exceptional and certainly inserted various laugh out loud scenes. It is a short runtime, and so I felt the pace was a tad too quick and rushed. However, this is Reitman's best work by far.",Tully
26,matthewssilverhammer,A supremely empathetic parental plea,9,10 May 2018,"We're all familiar with the idea of the ""duality of man"", those two sides of who we are that are counter to each other yet together make up who we are. Tully explores the ""duality of woman"", specifically the juxtaposing intricacies of what can make someone both a stable mother and simply an older version of their youthful leanings. In that, this movie becomes a rare sort of mumblecore film: one with a purpose. Thematically rich, progressively sweet and artfully entertaining, it's a Reitman-Diablo Cody director-writer collaboration (Juno, Young Adult) that shows a clear growth in both of their crafts.
Theron (with volatile brilliance) plays an overwhelmed mother of three who hires a young, free-spirited night-nanny to help restore some normalcy and rest to her life. Playfully, this dramedy uses horror to show the all-consuming terror of being a parent. It uses action-style editing to reveal the speed with which life passes you by, especially when you start having kids. With cunning self-awareness, it utilizes the ""manic-pixie-dream-girl"" trope to show our lustful desire for our own past. Throughout, Cody's dialogue beams with hilarious and loving honesty, especially when leaning into the mundanity of family life.
Above all, I don't remember the last time I saw a film so succinctly capture both the freedom and imprisonment of growing old and settling down. Even when the film takes turns toward incredulity, it always finds its way back, supremely interested in the mental state of people experiencing traumatic changes, all while staying as funny as it is potent. A supremely empathetic parental plea, Tully is exactly the crowd-pleasing respite we need in the Thanos-conquered cinema landscape.",Tully

No suspense.,6,27 February 2019,"I love Charlize Theron. Good acting by her, for sure. But the story is just plain dull. Only suited for mommies or wannabe mommies I guess, because there is no real supsense, no real drama. No real climax.

28,paul-allaer,Charlize Theron's performance carries this quirky little movie,7,12 May 2018,"""Tully"" brings the story of Marlo, a 30-something mother. As the movie opens, we see her caring for her son Jonah, while visibly high pregnant and due any day. When Marlo and her husband Dreew visit Marlo's brother Craig and his wife for dinner, Craig offers to pay for a night nanny. After giving birth to a baby girl, Marlo, ever exhausted and overwhelmed, agrees to the night nanny, whose name is Tully... To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourswlf how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie marks the return of the team consisting of director Jason Reitman, writer Diablo Cody and actress Charlize Theron, following 2012's ""Young Adult"" (Reitman and Cody previously collaborated on ""Juno""). Here they bring a portrait of today's motherhood that threatens to overwhelm women, or at least this woman, mother of 2 kids (of which one is ""socially challenged"") and now dealing with a newborn on top of that. I have to admit that I was wondering during the first half of the movie where all of this was leading to. Then in the second half it becomes clear, and I was transfixed (sorry, I shan't say more). Charlize Theron, who reportedly gained 50 pounds for this role, is absolutely amazing in the lead role, even as she appears in the most unflattering of (physical) ways. When her character Marlo exclaims to Tully that ""even getting dressed is exhausting"", you absolutely believe it. Last but certainly not least, there are some great song placements in the movie, none more so than from the up-and-coming indie female duo Beulahbelle, wit their delightful cover of ""You Only Live Twice"" and an original tune ""Let You Go"" (the latter plays over the movie's end titles).""Tully"" recently opened wide, and the Friday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (but by no means a well-out). If you liked ""Juno"" and ""Young Adult"", you can almost certainly bank on it that you'll also enjoy ""Tully"". For those of you who haven't seen ""Juno"" or ""Young Adult"", if you are in the mood for something a bit off center, ""Tully"" is not quite a comedy nor is it a drama, but in the end I think you'll resonate with these characters. I'd readily recommend you check out ""Tully"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Tully
29,jadavix,"Juno grew up, we lost interest",4,29 September 2018,"I suppose ""Tully"" is Reitman and Cody trying to be a little more realistic. Unfortunately it is also the least enjoyable movie they have made together. Cody's specialty is quirky characters. Here, the flake (the titular Tully) is more weird and irritating, and not interesting in the least. None of the characters really generate any interest.The only plot thread in the movie I could begin to care about was the central question of Charlize Theron's Marlo (why such a weird name?) being stressed and overworked by her new baby and unclassifiable son.Other characters in the movie feel underdone, and I found myself thinking the movie would work better without them. Marlo has a husband played by Ron Livingston who doesn't seem to be helping her. Why not? He's not portrayed as a bad guy, or as any kind of guy. Just ineffective. Why doesn't she ask him for more help, if she's so stressed she's having nightmares?The eventual appearance of Tully - which doesn't happen until half an hour into this 90 minute movie - is like something out of a horror movie. Her introduction is less quirky than terrifying, trying to peer through the window. Who would let this person near their kid? It made me wonder if this was a grown up Juno - perhaps with the sassy youthful spirit crushed by life so that she is now still making inappropriate comments, just without the energy to be witty.There is one truly bizarre, out of nowhere scene where Tully seduces the Livingston character while Theron watches - ""I'll tell you what he likes."" This scene is just so unbelievable that it approaches surrealism. It's one of those movie moments that has you waiting for the ""it was only a dream"" quick-edit, and when that doesn't come, you are frowning in disbelief, wondering what the filmmakers were thinking.And lastly, the movie has the tiresome shaky camera thing going in every scene. How long has it been since that made a film feel more realistic? Ten years? Twenty? Now all it does it distance you from characters that are impossible to believe in the first place. You can feel them trying their heart out to make it seem more realistic, and all that does is remind you how unbelievable it all is.",Tully

Theron tries her very best and is exceptional, but the script is a pile of dung. Somehow Jason Reitman's films are getting worse.

Theron really shines in probably one of her most realistic & unglamorous portrayals (apart from her Oscar winning role in Monster) limning a woman brought back from the brink due to right amount of understanding & rational insight into the maternal condition.

35,jadepietro,Au Pair Repair,5,9 May 2018,"GRADE: C THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A mishandled screenplay is in need of ""au-pair"", despite an excellent performance by Ms. Theron.JIM'S REVIEW: From the stern but loving Ms. Poppins to the gentle nurturing of Mrs. Doubtfire and the crazed slasher types in films like The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, the nanny has become a mainstay in films. Her appearance is always a catalyst for change and Tully certainly joins that legion. But this au-pair outstays her welcome fast in Jason Reitman's dramedy.Diablo Cody's screenplay starts out very promising by establishing its main character, Marlo, winningly played by Charlize Theron, as the mother of three. Adrift and alone in the pangs of depression and anxiety, Marlo is trying to cope and be a good mom and wife to her absentee husband Drew (Ron Livingston), while dealing with an autistic son (Asher Miles Fallica), a smart but precocious daughter (Lia Frankland), and a crying newborn. Ms. Cody's script shows the horrors of parenthood (the sleepless nights, the cluttered household, the utter exhaustion from the 24 / 7 job of being a parent. The film is brutally honest in its depiction and moviegoers immediately empathize with Marlo's dilemma. Plot-wise, her rich insensitive brother (Mark Duplass) offers her some help in the form of a night nanny to alleviate the daily stress. Enter Tully (Mackenzie Davis).Mr. Reitman solidly directs and captures the family dynamics well, with a little too much pop music lyrics telegraphing the narrative's message. He also secure fine performances from his cast. Ms. Theron is wonderful in the role and unleashes her emotional range in many well-drawn scenes (her anger with the school principal over her son's problems, her quiet moments of desperation in being a lonely wife, the physical drain on her body and mind, etc.) She also strikes a nice balance with Ms. Davis in the title role and their bonding seems real and slightly off-kilter, as it should be. Ms. Davis is a refreshing presence on the screen and plays her character with a mysterious ambiguity that provides a subtle tension.That said, you may ask, why the mild recommendation of this film?...and I will answer in this way: About the midway point, Ms. Cody's story loses its focus and its sense of logic and leads to a very disappointing conclusion, one that has no rhyme or reason. Without revealing too much of the twist, the film wants its story and plot to be seen on two levels, neither of which works due to some of the images and dialog scattered throughout the film. The contradictions do provide the conflicts but remain a mishmash of ideas. Its parts never congeal to a satisfying whole, despite the hard work by all involved.So, Tully is a movie that ultimately disappoints. It's an au-pair film in need of repair.",Tully
36,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Tully,7,23 May 2018,"2018's Tully is the type of movie studios just don't make anymore. I'm glad Denver and Delilah Productions stepped in and reconsidered. As something about an exhausted mother who hires and forms a friendship with her night nanny, Tully projects as an in-your-face drama with mild shades of kookiness. On the surface, it's about nannies. Look closer though because the flick may be about mental illness and hallucinatory weariness as well.Admittedly, Tully does have a final fifteen minutes that contain a few dangling plot threads. You might need to a second viewing just to put the pieces together. Also, the whole film places its good-hearted main character in the median of otherwise shallow, side characters. Regardless, Tully is a tribute to hard-working, struggling moms everywhere. There's endless detail here when it comes to a woman raising two small children and one budding newborn.Tully stars Charlize Theron as mama Marlo and Mackenzie Davis as caretaker Tully. Theron and Davis have great chemistry on screen and their performances for the most part, are exceptional. Theron channels Marlo with unassuming, nerve-ending intensity while Davis plays it calm, cool, and spiritual in a tailor made supporting role. I know it's only May but the Academy should now take note of these two.Marlo and Tully are apart in age but they form a special bond. They are like two best buds in the middle of the pitted, outside world. Tully the movie takes a detour when you realize that Tully the persona may instead turn out to be Marlo's actual, imaginary friend (small spoiler). Trust me, when the closing credits come up, you the audience member will be hard-pressed to get that notion out of your head. Director Jason Reitman is at the helm of Tully. He's the king of taking humdrum, everyday human situations and giving them some added bite. Jason also provides third act twists too. He shoots, fast cuts, and edits Tully partly like his 2009 pic Up in the Air and his Young Adult from seven years ago. George Clooney and frequent flyer miles withstanding, Jason seems to have a fascination with glowing women, pregnancy, and comprehensive breastfeeding. To each his own. Bottom line: Tully is insightful, initially heartbreaking, and contains a very sharp script by Reitman's partner in crime, Diablo Cody. Jason Reitman once again ""rights"" the cinematic ship in novel fashion. Rating: 3 stars.",Tully

I do like Diablo Cody as a writer and her teaming up with Jason Reitman can bring quality entertainment. The trailer for Tully made the film seem like an extremely real and accurate portrayal of what parenthood comes with. Charlize Theron is pretty much always on point and I was excited to see her pair with Mackenzie Davis. Overall, I liked the film. It slows in moments but the entire third act makes the film worthwhile.The film follows the life of Marlo, a recent mother of three whose life is mostly spent staying at home caring for her kids. Her relationship with her husband has been platonic for months and she is overworked and tired from the incredibly demanding efforts of taking care of her kids. She eventually decides to hire a night nanny named Tully and everything in her life changes. Marlo notices immediate changes in her life and Tully helps her explore the truth of her life, who she is, and what she wants.Theron was typically good in this film. The fact of the matter is, say what you want about motherhood and raising children being a gift, it also comes with a toll. You see that in this film. There is hardship and it can effect a mother's mental health. I think Mackenziie Davis was also excellent in a very free spirited and very quotable and insightful Tully. This is a sharp script that you just know came from the personal experience of Diablo Cody and is her best written film in a while.While the film is solid, it wasn't anything spectacular until the third act elevated the film. It hits you ""like a garbage truck at 5 am"" (a reference to the film, of course). A very welcome plot point occurs and really makes the film. Its an all around satisfying affair that won't disappoint many. I'd really like to see Mackenzie Davis in more films as her talent in this was a high point as well.

Her husband Drew, played by earnest Ron Livingston, is often away on extended business travel. When he is home, he's in bed playing video games on-line. That is Marlo's life. In Director Jason Reitman and Writer Diablo Cody's narrative Marlo experiences nearly insurmountable desperation, perhaps even depression. Yet, ""Tully"" tells its inspired story of healing oneself. Charlize Theron is bold and naked in her humanity. Her Marlo discovers salvation in the life-wise 26-year-old night nanny Tully. Mackenzie Davis is lulling gravitas as Tully, who touchingly tells Marlo, ""I'm here to take care of you."" Although, the narrative reveal nearly derails its noble intentions ""Tully"" creates that space in which we can all grant forgiveness, especially for ourselves. Marlo tears up when her troubled son Jonah, played by innocent Asher Miles Fallica says, ""I love you."" Theron's noble grace delivers the poignant message of acceptance that heals. I watched an interview with Charlize on ""Good Morning America"" talking about her role in ""Tully"". She is the mother of two adopted young children. Charlize said, ""Mothers are fearless.""

It's just a fact of life that your amount of free time shrinks once you get older, get married, and try to live the suburban dream. The tradeoff of having more love is sacrificing optimism. Now I'm not talking about optimism for the world; I mean optimism for yourself. When you're younger, you have dreams of making something or at least finding something that make you happy. Adding a lover, home, children, job, hobbies, bills and much more are going to take up more of that time, thus, diminishing that sensibility that was previously available. Even when operating on the most minimal of emotions to get through life, what does that do to ones mental state. Like a lot of things, it depends on the person. We get to see and exploration of that upon one mother in Tully.You really have to admire women like Marlo (played by Charlize Theron). Along with being pregnant with another child, she has to deal with her two children (one of them implied to have autism) and a husband Mark (Played by Mark Duplass) who seems to be living in a delusion that everything is fine. Unlike a lot of movies where mothers can still look beautiful, Marlo has been beaten down by life's burdens; early morning struggles to get her children to school, parent-teacher meetings about her son, finding anytime just to get a frozen pizza in the oven and not having a moment to workout. When she finally gives birth to her new daughter Mia, she's pushed even further into a deep depression (a combination of post partum and regular). She finally caves in and accepts her brother's gift of a night nanny. Tully (played by Mackenzie Davis) arrives soon enough and is overjoyed to be caring for a baby. She also has interesting conversations with Marlo from astronomy to history and music. Having this new friend gives Marlo the extra boost to try harder as a mom. Things take an unexpected turn in the last act that I wont give away.Tully reunites the directing team of Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody (who had previously worked together on Juno and Young Adult). The previous movies examined the anxieties of entering adulthood while this looks at what is to come with that next step. Tully is not a pretty movie and it knows this. Tully is proud to break down a lot of the tropes that typically show motherhood as a happy time. I'll admit that I've seen other movies that have done this before, but something about the look and writing make it downright scary.A lot of it has to do with Charlize Theron's performance. Tully is more proof that she has to be one of the hardest working actresses in Hollywood. To see her go from an action star from Mad Max: Fury Road and Atomic Blonde to a bloated and fat mother shows hoe much she's willing to understand within a character. I could somehow feel that same amount of stress that she had with her tired eyes. Think of it like constantly being out of breath despite having a hundred other chores to get to. I have to give a lot of credit to Mackenzie Davis, but I cannot go into too much detail without spoiling it.A lot of this movie deals with nostalgia and escape. It understands that many people too have been beaten down by the darker side of life and would love to return to a time of innocence. What Tully does (again, no spoilers) will throw off a lot of people with that they get. I'll admit that while I like how things go, I still think that keeping things more grounded would have benefited the third act more to come in full circle. Otherwise, this remains a good story on motherhood.I'll give this seven pairs of pregnancy pants out of ten. I think the movie's biggest strength comes from it's script rather then it's directing. Diablo Cody has a talent for breaking down a lot of the tropes within characters others want to be and making them more honest. I don't think Tully is a masterpiece or even one of the better Jason Reitman movies, but anyone whose ever been a parents should have no problem relating to Tully.",Tully

46,dave-mcclain,"sweet, touching and even important, but also kind of predictable and dull",6,7 May 2018,"""Tully"" (R, 1:36) is a drama (with a bit of comedy mixed in) which pays tribute to motherhood in a touching and creative way. It is directed by multiple Oscar nominee Jason Reitman (""Up in the Air"", ""Juno""), written by Oscar winner Diablo Cody (""Juno"") and stars Oscar winner Charlize Theron (""Monster""). This film represents a reunion for Reitman, Cody & Theron following 2011's ""Young Adult"".Theron plays Marlo, an overburdened mother of three. Her oldest child is an 8-year-old daughter who is growing self-conscious far too early. Her son is too often described by people as ""quirky"" and acts like he may be autistic. Her youngest is a newborn daughter. Marlo isn't a single mother, but she often feels like she is, with her loving, but overworked and clueless husband, Drew (Ron Livingston) offering little help.As a baby gift, Marlo's brother, Craig (Mark Duplass) pays for the services of a night nanny, someone to take care of the kids (especially the baby) at night, so mom can get some sleep. Marlo feels like using the services of such a person would be cheating and feels guilty about even considering accepting Craig's gift, but pushed to her physical and emotional limits by the demands of motherhood, she finally accepts.One fine night, a young woman named Tully (Mackenzie Davis) shows up at Marlo's door. The once-again new mother is still hesitant, but turns her newborn over to Tully's care, goes to bed and sleeps... well, like a baby. Marlo quickly warms up to Tully, drawn to the woman's free-spirited nature and appreciative of her help. Besides helping to take care of Marlo's infant daughter, Tully becomes Marlo's friend and confidant and helps her understand how to take care of herself - and improve her marriage.""Tully"" is original and sweet, but rather dull. The message of the importance of motherhood and the window it provides into the challenges of the world's second oldest profession are commendable, while the film's approach is fresh, but the story starts off slow, never really picks up much speed and is fairly predictable. The authenticity and empathy in the outstanding performances of Theron and Davis definitely give this film a boost, but it still only warrants a mild recommendation. ""B""",Tully
47,pietclausen,I didn't see that coming!,6,21 July 2018,"A quirky movie of a mom trying to cope with 3 kids. It kept me interested, but closer to the end I began to wonder where it was leading us to.Well now I know and the revelation was very cleverly done. This movie is an excellent view for the ladies, but men can learn a lot from it too by looking at themselves. I enjoyed watching it and reminisced those days in my own life.I was drawn to this film because of Charlize Theron and Mackenzie Davis, both acting their roles superbly.",Tully
48,kjproulx,Another Indie Gem,9,27 May 2018,"Although he has had a few missteps in my personal opinion, director Jason Reitman has always had a soft spot in my heart, at least in terms of how much I love his movies. Say what you will about how Juno holds up nowadays, but I still find that to be a fantastic picture, as well as thinking that Up in the Air may be one of my favourite films, period. His most recent outing in Tully has finally hit the big screen and I can pleasantly say that he has another great on his hands. This is a film that markets itself as a movie about a mother who struggles to deal with her children, and while that's definitely the setup, there's so much more under the surface. Here's why I believe Tully is worth checking out.Following Marlo, as she has already had a difficult life dealing with two children that aren't exactly perfect, she is now burdened with having a newborn as well. With her kids not really seeing life properly and her newborn reminding her of the times that she thought were behind her, she hires a night nanny to take care of her baby as she sleeps. This sparks into them having a nice relationship and some pretty incredible interactions come about. This is a very dialogue-heavy movie, but it's not riddled with too much backstory or exposition. These are two characters that you will more than likely grow to love throughout the movie and their arcs are more than paid off.Charlize Theron has always been a standout performer and her role as Marlo is absolutely no exception to that notion. The way she devotes herself to being this mother and making you believe she might have gone through scenarios throughout her real life was nothing short of inspired acting. That being said, Mackenzie Davis has been known for her work on many indie films and breaking out in last year's Blade Runner 2049. Their chemistry was magnetic and since their scenes together take up more than half of this movie, I was glued to the screen from beginning to end. Each character was given the perfect amount of exploration to make you feel a certain way about them.For myself, it all comes down to the writing and direction of a film like this. Yes, scores, editing, and cinematography (as well as many others) all play an important role in every film, but a film about raw human emotion truly comes down to the dialogue and performances. If you can't buy into what these characters are saying to each other or where they are at the beginning of the film in comparison to its conclusion (emotionally), then the movie will have lost my complete attention immediately. This is the type of film that knew how to perfectly cast its characters and flesh out a story that feels earned by the final few scenes.Tully is a film that is full of surprises throughout its third act. Whether it's a specific character decision or a literal shocking moment, this is a film that doesn't shy away from the harsh reality of real life. Theron and Davis are both incredible here and appearances by Mark Duplass and Ron Livingston can't ever hurt your film either. I can see where some viewers may be turned off completely during a specific moment in the final act, but if you are able to immerse yourself in the scene itself and looking back on the entire movie, I promise that the payoff will feel earned. Tully is riddled with impressive aspects and I can't talk highly enough about it. I have my issues here and there, but it's more than worth your time. Fantastic movie.",Tully
49,AhmedSpielberg99,So WARM and also RAW!,7,27 January 2019,"It was on my watchlist throughout the entire last year! I finally saw it, and I LOVED it!The first act is the best without a doubt; it's solid, intimate, and relatable. We also get to know a lot of things about the characters that are fairly enough to flesh them out. Most importantly, Marlo, the protagonist that is played by the amazing Theron, who effortlessly delivered a performance that is definitely worthy to be nominated for an Oscar.Near the end of the first half of the movie I felt that the movie is going to take a familiar path to continue its story, as the real problem has been solved so early. That what happens, except for the unorthodox way it happens with. This unique way of storytelling didn't redeem the issue of solving the problem only after the first half of the movie (which has some consequences that I consider the real issue with this movie), but it helped to delve deeper into the main theme of the movie, and hence gave us the moral at the end in a fulfilling way. This disguised-as-a-plot-twist way also added to the ""quirkiness"" of the movie. Case in point, the brilliant use of foreshadowing through the editing.The aforementioned ""consequences"" are the major issue I have with this movie, simply because the new problem of the second half of the plot came out of nowhere. So I wasn't surprised when I found that the movie began to lost me at the end of the second act, and completely lost me before the last 10-15 minutes, when I began to care about the characters once more after the reveal of the ""plot-twist"".Such a warm and a bit ""quirky"" hidden gem that captures the psychological process of maturity and maternity in a way that is both sincere and raw.(7.5/10)",Tully

The premise is quite flimsy and it never reaches another stage. It seems it would like to be clever, being both strong footed in hard reality and eyeing into fantasy. There is simply no talent in Reitman to make this emerge from the general dullness, numbness of this script.We have snobbish 'auteurs' in Europe who make this kind of lame movies about ordinary life, with an ecosystem of artsy critics to lecture us and inform those who see themselves as different, you know, with very accute flair.

An unusual wave of calm and happiness washes over Marlo's household. Marlo finely has time to treat herself better, and to improve her life and relationships.

Despite all that, it was filled with fantastic performances - most notably Charlize Theron, whose acting range is truly quite incredible when you consider her ability to go from cold-hearted serial killer to doting, yet exhausted Mum.Mackenzie Davis showed once again why she has become one of the most easily lovable actresses in the industry today. I pretty much love Mark Duplass in any film - and he was perfectly suited to his role, despite not having a lot of screen time.(This is where I initially wrote about what I didn't like about the writing, plot.

The film lives mostly from two great performances it offers. First of all we have Charlize Theron who once again went through a tough physical transformation for her role. She really played it well and absolutely believable. Theron understands very well to portray the ups and downs, the depressions and different emotions of her character. One of the best performance of her in recent years. A great revelation was Mackenzie Davis in the title role. She is seemingly the opposite of Theron's character but there is more to it and she wonderfully plays the free spirited and quirky nanny Tully. A performance that also works on different layers.
The rest of the cast is fine and servable but not really outstanding. The screeplay works although I hoped for more bite in the dialagoue especially considering it is written by Diablo Cody.

For much of the movie, I felt like that's what I was getting, until the third act blew my mind and changed the way I saw the whole movie. The primary theme in this film is clearly motherhood, but you really felt for Theron in her daily struggles to keep everything consistent. When the twist comes at the end, all these little things that were nagging at me all movie (why is she so willing to go along with what Tully wants? How is Tully so confident immediately? And there are similarities between Tully and Marlo) that in retrospect make a lot of sense. The visualization of Tully as a young, carefree Marlo adds so much to her character, and the full understanding of her mental illness and struggles hit me hard as it unfolded in my mind. There were a few funny moments, but I just felt it was consistent and realistic throughout. The script is so good - each scene is solid, but the development of Tully and Marlo with subtle details made it great.

59,CineMuseFilms,a comic-serious case study in post-natal psychosis,9,13 May 2018,"In off-Oscar-season times, originality stands out and one of the most original you'll see this year is Tully (2018). Sure, it is full of recognisable scenes, moments, and messages that not even extraordinary acting can hide. But it is the way the narrative has been framed and the unexpected climactic reveal that leaves this film lingering in your memory long after its viewing.We enter the story through the cliche window of a stressed-out and hugely pregnant Marlo (Charlize Theron) who is struggling to be a good mother for her eight-year old daughter and six-year old autism-spectrum son. Her useless husband Drew (Ron Livingston) expects dinner on the table each night and then retreats to his video games. Despite friend's promising that ""it gets easier each time"", the arrival of the unplanned third child becomes the tipping point for her downward spiral into a world of sleepless domestic chaos. She initially declines her wealthy brother-in-law's offer of a night nanny but on a day of multiple disasters she snaps and calls for help. Young and attractive Tullly (Mackenzie Davis) is soon on her doorstep and Marlo's world changes immediately. Tully delivers the baby for feeding, the house is clean, cakes are baked, and Marlo has a new best friend. Motherhood is a calm place until some weeks later when Tully announces she is leaving and events take unexpected turns that land Marlo in hospital. At one level the story feels familiar, maybe slightly fanciful, especially if you are a parent. The idea that you can be in a pit of despair and dial-in a home-delivered perfect solution is deliciously appealing. Some viewers will experience the film purely at a literal level that is comically foreshadowed in the trailer, especially the container of freshly pumped mother's milk tipping over and the cell-phone that is dropped on baby's head. Other viewers will spot the early clues but not realise until the climactic revelation that this film is a serious case study in post-natal psychosis. Combining magical realism, comedic drama, and a little understood mental condition into an entertaining movie is brave and original cinema. Releasing it in time for Mother's Day is almost mischievously deceptive. Charlize Theron gives an award-worthy performance that is a long way from comedy or fantasy: her portrait of a mother on and beyond the edge of sanity is grounded in the gritty daily grind of being a parent. There needs to be more films like Tully. While it is entertaining and even formative for some audiences to swoon over super-heroines and other fantasy females, those celluloid icons shed little light on how to live in the real world. Despite the controversy stirred up among motherhood and psychiatric fraternities, Tully can help improve understanding of post-natal mental health.",Tully

""Tully"", a film that represents the free spirit, dreams and goals of a woman at 40 with two children and pregnant with the third. The script tells the story of Marlo, our protagonist who begins to question her state during pregnancy, and put it. Postpartum depression, crisis of the 40, search for meaning, mental disorder? Each one has its interpretation, I prefer to interpret as a late dismissal of Marlo from his youthful life, inconsequential, but free, with the world at his fingertips, such a duality enchants the viewer, and his Twister plot - which does not surprise - is good . Jason conducts his film very well, with suspense angles, often causing tension and drawing maximum drama, with few humorous escapes, and a third act that should be more overpowering but over-run, although it contains the best scenes in the film. Charlize Theron is simply amazing, the actress has grown fat for her role and lives her drama almost personally, a personal and remarkable delivery that deserves at least an Oscar nomination.

(Also playing, Ron Livingston, Mark Duplass, Elaine Tan et al.)""Tully"" can be seen as a spiritual sequel to Reitman's 2011 superb ""Young Adult"" - also starring Charlize Theron and written by Diablo Cody - and it's also the director's best work since that.The movie feels sharp and authentic at portraying the life of a mother slowly drowning in her burden, and the subtle but expressive details make it a constant joy to watch. Even if one doesn't care about family life or parenthood, such as yours truly.As always, it's impossible to say how much of the movie's success owes thanks to Reitman, and how much to Cody or Theron - they make such a powerhouse creative trio.I can only claim with certainty that with 2007's ""Juno"", ""Young Adult"" and now ""Tully"", Reitman has created a truly noteworthy threesome of movies about becoming a parent, from different angles.The story concentrates mostly on two women, struggling mother and the free-spirited nanny. Theron is supposed to play it straight and concentrate on looking as physically and emotionally worn-down as possible, and she's perfect at that.But the show is stolen by Davis playing the mysterious young woman, with the freshness and charm abound which deserves an Oscar nom or something.There's something so spontaneous and winning about her that one probably don't notice how cliche-y the freeflowing girl of a character actually is. And when you do notice, they actually have a good explanation for that.Special shout-out goes to Theron's achievement of transforming into woman who's recently given birth, which involved gaining 50 pounds (nearly 23 kg) for the role, and spending a year and a half to shed the weight later. Theron is famous for this kind of taxing performances, beginning with 2003's ""Monster"" which brought her Oscar.""Tully"" is a better movie than one would expect at the beginning of summer season.

She returns to the subject of maternity with ""Tully,"" but there's a crucial difference this time: Cody has three kids of her own now, an experience that informs her painfully funny and sympathetic portrait of postpartum exhaustion. She's reunited with ""Juno"" director Jason Reitman, and with Charlize Theron, who starred in the Cody/Reitman joint ""Young Adult"" (2011), which I don't think I fully appreciated at the time. These three - the writer, her avatar, and her director - are a formidable team of dark comedians who understand human nature.Theron plays Marlo, wife of Drew (Ron Livingston) and mother of 8-year-old Sarah (Lia Frankland) and 5-year-old Jonah (Asher Miles Fallica), the latter of whom is probably on the autism spectrum but has so far only been diagnosed as ""quirky,"" a term that annoys Marlo. (""Do I have a kid or a f****** ukulele?!"") We don't know what Marlo is like normally because she's nine months pregnant when we meet her, but we understand she went through a period of depression after Jonah was born; that the new baby was unplanned; and that she's already tired. (I've never been a new mother, but I suspect those who have will see themselves in Marlo.)As a gift, Marlo's well-to-do brother, Craig (Mark Duplass), hires her a night nanny, which is exactly what it sounds like: a nanny who only works nights, letting mommy sleep and waking her only when the baby needs to feed. The nanny, a free-spirited 26-year-old named Tully (Mackenzie Davis, all rainbows), proves to be a godsend, not just tending to baby Mia in the wee hours but also cleaning the house and making cupcakes for Jonah's class. Wary at first of letting a stranger into the home to bond with her baby, Marlo comes to see Tully as a confidante. She even helps Marlo and Drew spice things up in the bedroom!Reitman uses a montage to show Marlo's zombified state before Tully arrives - the feedings, the changings, the stained clothes, the lying on the couch eating microwave nachos and watching ""Gigolos"" - and generally maintains a light directorial touch. Theron commits to the physicality of the role, her body appropriately un-toned and sloppy, bags under her eyes as she trades barbs with Jonah's principal (Gameela Wright) and contends with the other difficulties in her life. Marlo is weary, but she's also funny, and Cody finds abundant knowing humor in the situation without resorting to parenting cliches or falling back on self-consciously clever dialogue. She also explores the darker, sadder part of maternity very thoughtfully before coming to the happy ending foretold by the appearance of the Mary Poppins figure. As is often the case, the strange newcomer helps the medicine go down, but the power to overcome life's challenges was inside us all along.",Tully
67,itsbobr,Awesome Story,9,3 August 2018,"Craig (Mark Duplas) wants to make a gift of a Night- Nanny to his sister, Marlo (Charlize Theron), since she just had another baby, Mia. Marlo has two other children Jonah (Asher Miles) and Sarah (Lia Frankland). And Jonah is a handful to deal with. They call him Quirky, but I thought the word was autistic but that word was never mentioned. The Night-Nanny, Tully (McKenzie Davis) shows up and works for a while until she says she can no longer work for Marlo because she isn't needed anymore: she ""bridged a gap"" and Marlo can do things herself. This upsets Marlo and she crashes her car into the water. This will give many who don't really know about motherhood some insight when a new baby comes on the scene. We will get a real look at what motherhood is all about with the stresses that come with it, and a lot of it isn't pretty; but to be fair we also see the joys of motherhood too. However, having said all that: motherhood is still a mystery to many of us regarding how things got done that we really weren't aware of. (Hear! Hear!)We see Tully take care of everything, the house, the baby and Marlo too. 
The funniest scene was when a teacher in Jonah's school calms Jonah down by pretending he's a tree and gets Jonah to do the same and he does. The kicker is when the leaves are blown by the wind and the teacher goes all animated. Very funny. I especially liked the way Tully and Marlo bantered about a lot of things. The voices were quiet, informative, casual and very honest. Very good chemistry here and the pacing was just right. Ah, you always ask about a twist. Yes, there is one, but you may miss it and looking back on it, I really thought they would have let the cat out of the bag in a different way. The way they did it was not too subtle, and if you really pay attention, you'll get it. I read that Charlize Theron gained 50-pounds for this role, and it really looked good on this very beautiful actress. She is also the Executive producer in this. I wouldn't be surprised if Charlize Theron got an Oscar for her performance as it was perfect. (9/10)Violence: Yes, the car crashing into the water.
Sex: No.
Nudity: Brief, breast feeding.
Humor: Yes, quite funny dialogues at times.
Language: Yes, lots of it.

68,jackgdemoss,A stunning tribute to motherhood,8,19 June 2018,"Tully was not at all what I expected based on the previews, in a good way! A shocking and at times, disturbing look into the trials and tribulations of motherhood. The acting is fantastic, and the plot stays fresh the whole time. A great, multilayered message that anyone can take something positive away from.",Tully
69,Gresh854,"Remarkable First Two Acts, Falls Slightly Flat In The Third",5,20 May 2018,"Tully was a delightful yet darkly truthful tale of the struggles of motherhood. All though, the third act is a bit droll and this isn't a film I'd necessarily see again, it's still worth watching once for the performances from Charlize Theron and Mackenzie Davis. (Verdict: B)",Tully
70,Bertaut,Examining something rarely seen on-screen,7,10 May 2018,"Tully tells the story of Marlo (Charlize Theron), a New York suburbanite pregnant with her third child. Her husband, Drew (Ron Livingston) is loving, but somewhat neglectful, showing more interest in playing video games than helping Tully maintain the house and family. Clueless about the pressures of motherhood, he fails to notice when Marlo begins to show signs of post-natal depression. However, shortly after the baby's birth, Marlo's wealthy brother, Craig (Mark Duplass) hires a night nanny named Tully (Mackenzie Davis) to help take some of the pressure off Marlo. Reluctant to embrace the idea at first, Marlo soon forms a tight bond with Tully, who introduces Marlo to a lifestyle she had never imagined.Tully is one of those films that the less you know about it before seeing it, the better. Featuring committed performances from Theron and Davis, the film is written by Diablo Cody and directed by Jason Reitman, a partnership which also produced Young Adult (2011), in which Theron also starred. There's a definite thematic uniformity between the two films, as if they exist in an almost sliding doors-like relationship to one another. My only real issue with Tully is that the supporting characters are very thinly drawn - Drew, the well-meaning but ineffectual husband, is especially void of substance. Although, to be fair, the nature of the story, to a certain extent, necessitates this. In any case, this is an excellent study of an issue very rarely put on-screen - imperfect motherhood. A word of warning though; neither the poster, nor the trailer do the film any favours whatsoever. It's funny in places, but this is not a comedy.",Tully
71,LukeCustomer2,Interesting film but the twist didn't work,7,18 August 2019,"I enjoyed this film as a story about a mother suffering under the stress of three children. But at the end there is a ""twist"" that is supposed to make the movie better but didn't for me. The twist is that Tully is not real. Tully is Marlo. But that is sort of given away early on when Tully doesn't seem to have any interaction with the husband. Marlo tells her husband that the night nanny is downstairs with their newborn and that she is ""weird"" and the husband shrugs and goes to bed. Nope not buying that. They husband would want to meet her -- at least once. Throughout the movie you notice that there is no interactions with the husband and night nanny or anyone else. I noticed all of that. There is no last name for the night nanny and she is vague about what she does during the day. Finally it was hard to believe in the sort of supernaturally unhelpful husband who seems completely unaware how much his wife is suffering. The movie is compelling though and worth it for the scene where Marlo tells of the school that calls her in every day over her son.",Tully
72,scb_coldsteel,Nice mix of comedy and drama,8,1 October 2018,"I saw the movie Tully last night in theaters. I was really looking forward to it as I'm a fan of the writer and director who also did Juno and Young Adult. Overall I really enjoyed the movie.For starters Charlize Theron was outstanding. She physically and mentally transformed herself for this role. She perfectly portrayed the challenges of motherhood while also dealing with mental illness.Mackenzie Davis also did a great job playing the whimsical and charming Tully. She really played a perfect counterbalance to Theron's character throughout the film.The movie had a very real and human plot that accurately depicted the struggles a couple goes through with the birth of a child. I also thought the movie did a great job depicting a complicated issue like postpartum depression.Overall the movie was a nice mix of dark humor, drama, and charm. As expected from the writers the movie had a sharp and biting wit the didnt veer away from a complicated issue .I really enjoyed the movie for both it's honesty and entertainment. There is a twist that happens at some point in the movie that I could have done without, but the movie was still solid. A 8.25 out of 10.",Tully
73,plasticanimalz,Fantastic,8,5 May 2018,"Charlize was great, as always, and Mackenzie Davis was magical. It's a real-world take on Mary Poppins. Was really looking forward to this film and was not disappointed. Diablo Cody took a darker turn from Juno with Young Adult, which was darkly hilarious, and she again took a stark subject and sprinkled it with hope and a bit of whimsy. The film is not going to make you want to run out and become a mother but it also paints a more real look on how motherhood can be hard, stressful, seemingly impossible at times, but ultimately rewarding. It's not your glossy, magical look on motherhood, falsely advertised in most film and TV. I can't say much more on it without giving away the plot which needs to be seen for itself. But the themes they explore in the film are highly relatable for anyone whether they have kids or not. It will leave you thinking.",Tully

75,Moviegoer19,Spread Too Thin,6,1 February 2019,"A lot was going on in this movie; if one saw the ending without having seen the rest of it, they would conclude it was about a troubled marriage that was resolved, evidenced by the husband and the wife hugging and saying, ""I love us."" For me this was a weird and unsatisfactory ending to a movie that had so many issues touched upon. Here's a rundown: there was the issue of aging; changing body image; changing one's lifestyle from wild and crazy to settled and stable; all the issues of having not one, not two, but three children including the issues of pregnancy and childbirth; the issue of breast feeding and the considerable impact it has on one's body and one's lifestyle; the inevitable chasm that develops between a stay-at-home mom and a hard-working husband who also is trying to be a good dad; lack of sexual relationship for many justified reasons; post-partum depression; ruing the loss of pre-marriage and motherhood interests (in this case, she was an English Lit. major in college); homoerotic feelings and referred-to relationships, including implications of such between Theron main character and the nanny; need for self-care, respect and support; the considerable difficulties of having an autistic child; dealing with extended family; family financial issues; and ultimately the presence of subconscious dreams and goals present in both day and night dreams, impacting on her sense of her day-to-day life.Yes, all of these were in this film, and there may be more which I've left out. Very ambitious to try and touch upon all this in an hour and a half or so. Though I enjoyed watching it, thanks to Charlize Theron's superb acting skills and much less to the script, when it finished I was sitting here going ""Huh?"" Is that what Diablo Cody intended? Somehow I don't think so, but then, who knows? Perhaps she was aiming for an overall sense of chaos with an ending that didn't really feel resolved.",Tully
76,grumpy-3,way overrrated,1,6 January 2019,"Firstly this is not a comdey at any time, so the comedy/drama is a no. seecondly the film is exruciatingly slow, very little of any importance happyens. the repittion of the boring drugdery routines was ridiculous. the reveal at the end just made this a so what story. and when they do the flashbacks to what really happened, it did not make sense, because we see her all forlorn and miserable whereas before she was having a good time, i hate these, either it was a dream movie or all in my head, when they cannot resolve it",Tully

It is a very realistic depiction of a mother, who feels alienated from life and her surrounding loved ones as her needs are not being met. Her husband is a very realistic charachter of a terrible husband, playing video games and pretending the kids are not his job. The story is compelling, and while it might turn you off having kids ever (or a husband), it will haunt you. There is a twist in the story that is better left unsaid, and needless to say, brilliant acting by the two amazing actresses and brilliant writing by Diablo Cody.",Tully
78,JankiSharma,happy imagination,9,16 June 2018,"The movie Tully directed by Jason Reitman is very pleasant and caters to many new moms desires of having peace and quiet after a long 36 to weeks of carrying a baby inside. Direction is good .I have enjoyed other movies especially Up in the air and Juno. Diablo Cody wrote well for this movie.
Charlize Theron is terrific as Marlo , a third time mom. I particularly liked the scenes between Marlo and her second child, a son with some autism , somewhere on the spectrum. The rich brother Craig (actor Mark Duplass) offers pregnant sister a night nanny as a baby shower gift. The whole idea and presence of night nanny Tully (very pleasant Mackenzie Davis) is great. Moms need help, both physical , mental and spiritual. i enjoyed the script ,acting, Direction and concept of movie Tully.",Tully
79,athena24,Original and well executed.,8,4 August 2018,"Very original and beautifully executed movie about the post-birth depression (not a ""baby-blues""). The 'comedy' tag for Tully is misleading; it's a bitter drama with a very interesting idea. If you're close to the subject (birth, babies...) it shouldn't leave you indifferent.Charlize Theron and Mackenzie Davis are exceptional (specially Charlize Theron) in their roles. I think that the main point of the movie, showing the exhaustion related to post-birthing depression is brilliantly passed to the viewer.Although a very good movie, there is some sense of incompleteness. Also, the relationship between Marlo and Drew is undeveloped.",Tully
80,Camoo,Empathetic and special,7,21 April 2019,"Tully is a strange and beautiful film with a lot of extraordinary qualities, and then some I wish it had gone further with. What is undeniable is that Diablo Cody and Jason Reitman craft very strong films together, with something to say, and I admire their dedication to sticking to these sorts of middle-budget, adult films in a world currently saturated with big budget comic book adaptations and TV series. It's a comfort and joy to watch a film that so respects its audience.The film's premise is fairly straightforward. We follow Marlo (Charlize Theron) as she struggles to raise her troubled son, daughter and new baby along with an aloof husband (Ron Livingston), and seems perpetually on the brink of a major breakdown. That is until she is saved by a nanny, Tully (MacKenzie Davis), who arrives like a whirlwind one night to help her with her motherly duties. Part Mary Poppins, part Juno, Tully is at first a character who seems typical of the Diablo Cody universe - sprightly and sardonic, referencing Pinky and the Brain and rattling off facts which do not pertain to this story but completely pertain to Cody's style of writing. But then, the film takes some turns, and makes certain decisions which had me nodding in agreement; the decisions surprised me, and delighted me, and kept me wanting to know more about these people and what kind of conundrums they might find themselves in.I won't spoil the film, but there is a twist in Tully which I'm not sure is entirely deserved, and threw me for a loop. It forces a re-evaluation of everything that comes before, but instead of the pieces all fitting neatly into its puzzle, it leaves questions, holes, and threads not well enough resolved. It was almost like Cody had written this film in a line, and then when it got to that point she decided to change gears and add this element after the fact, attempting to stuff the bulk of the script into it. In any case, I understand what was being aimed for, but I was unable to suspend my disbelief enough to buy into it, which is one of the film's major frustrations.Another criticism is of Ron Livingston's character Drew, whom I felt was a bit one-dimensional and boring, a cutout father figure whom I anticipated would be more creatively drawn but by the end I knew no more about him than I did at the beginning, nor cared much about his and Marlo's relationship, as no relationship was ever developed well enough for them to live in.What I loved about the film were the moments it took us into unexpected realms, and the wonderful performance by Charlize Theron who has shone in both collaborations with these filmmakers.",Tully
81,catfanatic888,"I was so surprised, I watched it TWICE!",9,13 June 2020,"I seem to be in the minority but I didn't see the twist coming. I watched it again to see how I missed it. There were clues but I didn't catch them...the First time. It is NOT A COMEDY! If you select this, don't expect a lot of humor. However it is sensitive, curious and refreshing. I loved Charlize's Young Adult. This is excellent.",Tully
82,jfh-72320,"Not a comedy, boring.",3,21 July 2018,"Depressing movie. Really doesn't matter the caliber of acting. It's miserable. I'm guessing that the glowing reviews come from women identifying with the same miserable life: more kids than they should have, and a husband who contributes nothing to helping take care of them. The only bright spot is the personality Davis's character.",Tully
83,nitro72,Sure-Handed,8,7 April 2019,"Charlize Theron gives a complex & moving performance in this well-crafted,engaging, & wholly relatable story; Diablo Cody's story is tight & her dialogue (finally) rings true (& not so 'Juno'-phony); sure-handed direction throughout.",Tully
84,RMurray847,"4.0 out of 5 stars Theron shines, and Cody's script is full of great moments. A near gem that's very watchable and enjoyable.",7,8 January 2021,"TULLY is a funny and frustrating look at motherhood through the eyes of a very tired, borderline post-partum depressed mom, played by Charlize Theron. We first meet Theron when she's very pregnant, and already very stressed taking care of the two kids she has already. A nervous daughter who is smart but way too hard on herself, and a son who clearly is ""on the spectrum"" somewhere, and is becoming a real problem at his private school. A school his parents can't really afford. The baby that's on its way is clearly seen as a mixed blessing at best by Theron and her somewhat absent husband (played by Ron Livingston.)The baby arrives, and sure enough, it's too much for Theron to handle. Her brother (Mark Duplass), who is doing QUITE well in business, suggests she hire a night nanny (a gift from him)...essentially a person who will take care of your newborn during the night so you can get a good night's sleep yourself. Reluctant at first, but finally buckling to her own crushing exhaustion, Tully enters Theron's life. Mackenzie Davis plays Tully as a nearly perfect answer to Tully's need. She is empathetic. She is patient. She is understanding & funny. And most importantly, she takes care of the baby, cleans the house and even makes snacks for the kids. Theron finally gets some sleep. And with sleep, she re-engages with her household...finally serving something other than frozen pizza for dinner, being attentive to her older kids and just generally being in a better mood.Much of the film revolves around the amusing night-time conversations between Theron and Tully, and an unusual friendship develops. It is here that the dialogue (from Oscar winner Diablo Cody) really sparkles. We come to feel the relationship between these two women very closely, and invest our attention into looking forward to what happens next, and next, and next. There are amusing surprises in store.Director Jason Reitman keeps things moving along briskly. This indie-spirit film moves at the clip of a mainstream movie...making it extremely engaging. Theron is really terrific, and throws herself into this unflattering role in a way that makes us sympathize for her greatly even while we're frustrated by some of her actions. Davis is delightful as the free-spirited Tully, and Livingston, in his understated way, makes for a good foil. The actors playing Theron's kids are very sharp as well. This is a movie that really delights the viewer with excellent performances that are sparked by a script with heart and a fair amount of wit.Why not 5 stars? It's a close call, really. I docked it a half star or so because some of the scenes of chaos in Theron's life are perhaps just a bit too broad and hard to believe. Cody has written them on a very fine line between believable and ""too much."" That teetering takes some of the film's potential power away. Specifically, scenes between Theron and various leaders at her son's school paint the school officials with a very big ""villain"" brush, and with no subtlety. And I like Mark Duplass in some things, but his characteristic smugness makes him too one-dimensional in this film.These gripes aside, TULLY is amusing, sometimes sad and VERY frequently surprising. It takes you down a few predictable roads, which only makes the surprise detours all the more impactful. It's absolutely worth checking out, especially for just about anyone who has had to raise kids.",Tully
85,ccamp89,Unsatisfyingly sits the fence between drama and comedy,5,22 May 2018,"Tully isn't quite funny enough to entertain as a comedy, nor is it weighty enough to engross as a drama. It certainly tries to be both, but in doing so spreads itself thin to the point where neither the comedic nor dramatic elements are explored beyond a superficial level. The result is a film that's mildly pleasant and inoffensive but fails to leave a lasting impression. I appreciated the themes dealing with aging, the transitory nature of identity, and motherhood as an identity void. There are some clever observations on the matter here and there, and Charlize gives a committed and enjoyable performance. But it's somewhat slight, and the film goes on to attempt to dig deeper with a twist ending that doesn't quite land. It feels like it's trying to reach for something profound to give the film some much-needed impact but plays as unnecessary and contrived. There are also times when Diablo Cody's trademark sardonic dialogue veers into overwritten territory, with characters saying things that feel too much like script-talk - ""I'm like Saudi Arabia; I have an energy surplus."" ... huh? It's mostly fine though, but rarely more than that.Strong 2.5/5",Tully
86,neil-43355,Good Movie,8,23 July 2018,"Its a strange movie and even having just watched it, I still can't really describe whether its a comedy or drama - however, what I can say is the two female leads were absolutely fantastic, its well written, has a bit of a twist and its a movie where you actually care about the characters.

Easily relatable and identifiable for any parent-how many ways do we divide ourselves to accommodate all those we love? And at what cost? But the film makers flexed some creative muscle to get this story told right. I am astonished by how moved I was when the subtle fairy tale evaporated, and reality came seeping back in to the frame. Being a parent is tough. It sucks everything we have out of us. But for women, as mothers, that pressure, and the demands upon that corresponding additional generosity, is factored even higher. Charlize Theron is a powerful amplifier for the message and transforms much like she did in Monster. She should prepare an Oscar acceptance speech.",Tully

Charlize proves once again why she's probably the best actress of her generation and it was great seeing Ron Livingston again! This was an honest portrayal of parenting and the highs/lows of it. Being a parent is one of the toughest jobs in the world and shouldn't be taken lightly. I loved a lot of the dark humor, like the lifetime bit and many more of Marlo's quips. It took me awhile to piece it together that Marlo and Tully were one and the same; kinda figured it out during the waitress costume scene. I thought the twist and the car wreck were really good surprises. This film makes you question if the ""American dream"" of marriage, kids, surburbia, stability, etc is for everyone.",Tully
91,pamma09,True for many moms,8,4 May 2018,"This movie says so much more than what is on the surface. Marlo a mother of 2, with one on the way is handling things just OK.

Her brother, with whom there is a not the greatest relationship, offers to get her a night nanny and it takes her awhile to take him up on it. And her life changes after first night of good sleep - and she and has a new friend too.
She starts being able to handle her sons needs, take care of herself and slowly you learn what is behind it all.
Many men and woman (who have not had children) do not understand the post-partum time - it is not easy all the time and with so many things on the plate of a mother with more children - it is hard.
I was not prepared for the last part - but I am sure I will be thinking of it for quite awhile. To me a good movie is one that I still think about weeks later. I loved Diablo Cody's writing - again.",Tully

I like the parts with her son and what a versatile actress Charlize is again even gaining weight for the role & everything it really does make it seem more realistic to actually look like most new moms and Charlize has sum balls to put herself out there like that but ya I think this movie coulda been way better,Tully
93,Eclectic-Boogaloo,A truly wonderful film.,8,16 May 2018,"Tully's a movie that's at its funniest, most entertaining, and most poignant, in its candid depiction of a woman's struggle with both the run up to childbirth, and the postpartum of it. But beware: this movie isn't what you think it is. But boy is it good.It's wonderfully written by Diablo Cody, who does what she does best here while also stepping outside of her genre comfort zone. I should also add that the film's director Jason Reitman brought a deft touch to the tricky material and also got in a few sequences of dynamic visual flair. Tully was much more visually engaging than the trailers suggested.Charlize Theron was really great as Marlo, an already overburdened mother pushed to the precipice by the birth of her third child... That is until someone in her life (played by Mark Duplass) hired a night nurse named Tully (played by a charming as all hell Mackenzie Davis) to ease her strain. I should also add that Ron Livingston was good in a role that was mostly unremarkable until the third act of the movie.All and all if you liked Juno and Young Adult, I believe you'll also like Tully, even though the movies trajectory isn't as conventional as the aforementioned films. I also think you'll find that Tully stands as both, a wonderful companion to those films, and a bold creative step in a different direction.",Tully

Therefore, whether it is a fairy-tale turnaround or a slightly stylized theme, it presents a sense of surprise beyond the general type of film set.

As a person who didn't have kids this movie is effective birth control. Probably, mothers can relate to it, however, watching how miserable the main character is, i asked myself: WHY? why would you want to have kids, because this movie doesn't show ANY redeeming part of being a parent: routine, exhaustion, no sex, no actual connection with the partner, uncontrollable kids and even school system that can't guide and help you. You are all alone there in this misery. BUT I do think that being a parent can be great, however this movie missed this point completely.
Also, the choices the main character made: you have two kids when one has mental problems and you go and pop up the third one when you financially strained and can't manage the second one? OK, so it is surprise baby and you are pro-life, but then you refuse to have nanny/help because you want to be this perfect mother or super hero? she sacrificed sort of career, other life choices, sex, etc. It looks like her life is everything about motherhood and nothing else matters, but why? Does ""being a mother"" mean you stop being a person, a female, a friend, a partner? No life after you have kids? Is it a must? the movie doesn't show any ""happy part"" of being a parent and why these sacrifices are needed.

I was pleasantly surprised. It's not the fastest paced movie, but very realistic in terms of some of the struggles women go through when having babies and trying to actually live a real life afterward. I know if Charlize Theron is in a movie, I usually like it. This movie had things every parent could relate to - problems with kids at school, body image issues after pregnancy, longing for your previous single life. The ending was unexpected and was a great way to make you go back and think about the rest of the movie. I recommend!",Tully

104,ryanbartlett-870-746486,Not a typical mother biopic,6,14 August 2018,"Charlize Theron takes on the role of playing a mother of three in need of a revival. She shines in the role as she always does of riding the emotional rollercoaster in being a mother. With highs few and far between, writer Diablo Cody really took a deep dive into motherhood, not fully capturing what it's like to be a mother, but more of a take on how hard it can really be. How tired moms get, and how many responsibilities that they have to keep up with. 
This is shown off with her take on the idea of a night nanny, a young woman who comes in and helps out where she needs help. Which really is just showing the problems of being maybe not an absent father, but definitely not a very helpful father. With this new night nanny Marlo, played by Theron, hopes to have her life's stress to go away and for peace to fall upon her. 
From al of the biopics that comes out these days, there was so many indicators that this would be a biopic of a mother, one that has surprisingly not been done very well in the past. However, Cody decides to go down a more theatrical and dramatic take. With the addition of Tully in her life, the story takes many different turns and travels further past bio-pic and more into a dramatic almost thriller.",Tully

107,MikeC19,Not the easiest I've sat through...,4,29 May 2018,"Why did I want to see this movie: I had a half-interest, stemming from the fact that I've seen all of Jason Reitman's movies (minus ""Labor Day""), and enjoy Charlize Theron, as an actress. I was quite unsure if I could get into this movie, considering I know nothing about being a mother, and I was sure this wouldn't be as quirky as ""Juno"". The Good: Charlize does a fantastic job, really making you believe her character. You see the ups and downs of being a parent, and how her situation affects her life. Mackenzie Davis is a real standout, too, as Tully. She's an interesting character that you want to know more about. I'd also like to mention that I think the supporting cast are enjoyable, too.The Bad: Kids can really wear you down! This is seen quite clearly, and the more I saw, the more I wanted to leave the theater. The montage of Charlize, getting up every night to check on the baby, really affected me. Raising children is no game, it's hard work! The candid look at some people's reality is a gamechanger. You see how hard it is, and it's upsetting to see. The whole movie isn't a downer, but the laughs come from ""life situations"", not gags. Overall: I won't ever feel it necessary to revisit this film, but I can see the message they were trying to say when they made it. Life has ups and downs, and things usually end up OK, but there can be some major frustrations. Not particularly recommended, but well acted and well made. 4/10",Tully

This movie has is a bright light in a very dark room.Charlize Theron is that light. She's unbelievable and never allows you to escape her reality as a mother addressing depression, marriage, boredom, aging, and being a parent of problematic children. Without giving too much away, I'd call this film a breath of fresh air that probably needs to fill the lungs of many people that suffer from the same issues.Give this film a go, and bring some Kleenex.

109,iamjacksmoviechannel,Thank Your mom today,8,4 May 2018,"Hey, forget Infinity War for one day and spend some time with Diablo Cody and Jason Reitman's movie about the real first avengers...your moms. Marlo is a mother of 2 with a third on the way who has a young special needs son called ""quirky"" by the school system.He's seemingly on the autism spectrum but much like the move's handling of this mental illness and what comes later, ""Tully"" isn't exactly attuned on the specifics of mental disorders.No, this is a movie about motherhood, a role Charlize Theron gained 50 pounds to portray accurately, so she's looking at Oscar, and right now she seems like the definite frontrunner.Marlo seems like she's carrying 10 pounds of stress weight per every physical pound. When she lets her kids break the screen time rule, you know it's just so she can grab precious peace minutes. Plus there's mental toll. ""Tully"" does an awesome job of showing a woman who essentially became a sexless caregiver and is now just broken as anything else. She's told about night nannys, which downside is having a stranger care for your baby, but you get uninterrupted sleep without having to push a finger of whiskey in your kid's mouth so it seems like a winner. The nanny turns out to be Tully, played by Halt and Catch Fire's Mackenzie Davis. She's nurturing, she cleans the house, she makes you feel special, she makes you want a Tully of your own.Yes she seems too good to be true, addressing not just the kid's issues but Marlo's as well. It leads to some funny stuff, like a sex therapy three-way. It's funny but but also makes you think about mom and what she's given up to do what she does, and even with a crutch like Tully, that's a whole lot.If you like this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more.",Tully

111,ukxenafan1,Surprising **spoilers**,9,5 January 2019,"I'd heard good things about this film and am a fan of both Theron and Davis. Add in the Diablo Cody/Jason Reitman double act whose Juno and Young Adult are a couple of my favourites.
The film starts as a straightforward but well-observed portrait of a stressed out mum played by Charlize Theron, who has embraced this less than glamorous role by piling on the pounds - as she did for Monster. With 2 demanding little kids, a new baby arrives to expand the family and we wonder whether this addition will push Marlo over the edge. However evetually Marlo agrees to employ a night baby nurse and Tully (Mackenzie Davis) arrives.SPOILERSNOWThe first things that occurred to me as soon as Davis appears is how similar she looked to Theron - similar height, colouring etc. As it turns out, no accident, of course! The way the relationship is built between the two made me wonder if there was going to be a romance between them. There is an immediate intimacy and connection. Indeed, the scene when Tully dresses up in a waitress uniform and appears to seduce Marlo's pretty useless husband Ron Livingtone - apparently with Marlo's participation - seemed odd until you realise the twist of who Tully really is. The misdirect, that this might turn into a gay romance, continues as Marlo and Tully both refer to female flat mates who are clearly more than just a friend, but I must admit, I didn't guess that Tully was a representation of Marlo's younger self until the accident on the way back from a boozy night out. Tully is somehow a mermaid, Marlo is hospitalised and we learn her maiden name, yes, TULLY. Now it all makes sense - why Davis was cast for her similar physicality to Theron, why no one else ever saw Tully, that waitress seduction. We didn't really need the quick recap showing the highlights of the film but with Marlo alone where previously we had seen Tully. I spent the last few minutes rewinding it in my head and re-examining the events.
Huge kudos to Charlize Theron, who fully embraces the role and puts her flab proudly on display. But her performance is more than the weight gain. Frazzled stressed out mothers have been seen on screen in everything from Bad Moms to Ladybird, but Theron sells it completely.However, there are plenty of unanswered questions about this film. Is it a portrayal of post-partum depression? Is the twist too much of a cheat? Does the film pull another con by making the husband quite so oblivious? For me, this was a surprising but fascinating film. That twist totally kicked the legs out from under me and I was really taken in. I was also super impressed by Theron's range - shaven headed action hero in Mad Max Fury Road, she shows again that she will do anything for a good role. I love her lack of vanity and commitment to characters with depth.
Not a big box office hit, I'm glad to see Theron in the awards conversation for this film. Diablo Cody and Jason Reitman are turning into one of my favourite combinations too.",Tully

In what is probably Charlize Theron's best work yet, she shows us what we all know about life: it's hard, annoying, stressful, and we hate it - but within what is real and what is perceived, within what we love and enjoy, within our friends and family, and within ourselves, we can find power to keep going and make it better.

115,littlemankazoo,"Intriguing, albeit a bit unfocused",7,9 May 2018,"""All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts""There's perhaps no stories in film more fascinating than those about our mothers. In a way, a mother has to play multiple roles, as Shakespeare described, which makes them better actors than most. They make up all parts in order to satisfy those who they love or simply tolerate, which makes the emotional core of stories about motherhood and parenthood that much more fascinating.In ""Tully"", however, I don't think I have ever seen the concept of a Mother needing to play multiple roles done in a more intriguing execution.The newest film from duo Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody (The directing/writing team behind ""Juno"" and ""Young Adult"") ""Tully"" truly is a film about motherhood, but it is also a film about not losing yourself in the process. It is about how motherhood can indeed drive you crazy. It is indeed a film about a lot of things, some of them absolutely insane, which made it the fascinating little film I managed to find it.The strengths of this film are prominently the performances, as Charlize Theron simply knocks it out of the park. You buy every second of her as Marlo, an overworked and teetering-on-depressed mother of three who's struggle comes from life and what it expects of her. In addition, we also have Mackenzie Adams as Tully, her ""night nanny"", who plays-off brilliantly with her and makes for a really lovely chemistry between them. If anything was a massive plus for this film, the performances are that.The screenplay also manages to be an interesting enigma in of itself, as I cannot fully describe it as ""realism"" or ""surrealism"". What I CAN describe it as, however, is ""great"". It is a great piece of writing that never feels forced in its efforts, though its main pitfalls come from its pacing.The pacing is a bit aimless, and at times I had to wonder where the real structure was. It feels as if we make it two acts in, but the third act really only deflates and we find ourselves in a dead-end. Even with the film's admittingly intriguing twist it decides to take to steer its course in another direction entirely, I almost feel the film's third act was underdeveloped and needed more foundation to give us the full impact of this direction Cody and Reitman decided to take.With that in-mind, the film feels uneven at its worst. It could have truly used more to it than a nice screenplay with good performances with an interesting twist to its concept. While ""I want more!"" is not a terrible complaint for a film, I feel this one needed more to it if one were to really leave this film feeling they had been told a great story that they never saw coming.In the end, ""Tully"" doesn't truly re-invent the wheel, nor does it fall into too many pitfalls. Armed with great performances and a script that isn't too complex but just interesting enough, I think the film is a different enough twist on the classic mother story to be worth a look. It doesn't do anything terrible, and its performances and screenplay are what make it rise above standard fare.In the end, I recommend seeing it for Charlize Theron alone, a woman who is seemingly so good at playing every role she is given. Much like a mother is expected to do so, in a way. In that sense, she was perfectly-casted, no?",Tully

117,doofuspoofus,Deserves the praise Juno received,10,14 May 2018,"I knew going into this film that I would love it simply from being able to relate to it. I have a six month old baby and mine too was unplanned. Watching this movie was like looking at a montage of the first few months of being a mom. You're exhausted all the time and like her I was the one doing all the late nights while my husband got to sleep. Sometimes you become so tired you feel as if you're an outsider to your own life and I think this film did a perfect version of expressing that feeling while also expressing the fact that when you become a wife and a mother you're so busy focusing on everyone else you begin to lose pieces of who you were. Without giving away the twist I can say I loved the meaning behind it. The older you get and the more you put others ahead of yourself the more you become a different person and who you were when you were younger seems almost like it didn't happen. It becomes harder to recognize and remember the younger version of yourself because it seems like (and in some ways it was) another life. This film meant so much to me as a mother just starting out because it felt so reassuring to know other women are going through the same experiences particularly never feeling like you're doing well by your kids even though you try so hard every single day. You look at other mothers and think ""now there's the perfect mother"" when in reality every mother has to go through that phase of life after giving birth when your body is different and you don't feel as attractive and you have to deal with how that affects your marriage and self image. It's just a fantastic film that doesn't try too hard to be it just is. It just is. This is what it's like to be a mother and I've heard some people in reviews say the movie was boring well guess what? That's what makes it real. Real motherhood is not a Real Housewives episode.

Whilst I liked watching the relationship between Tully and Marlo grow and develop (and what could have been a great opportunity for character development) it was totally and utterly ruined.
Marlo and her husband end up having a threesome with Tully, whom they have barely known for five minutes, (Is it supposed to be hot? intriguing? surprising?) Whatever the director was going for, they totally missed the mark but this was just the beginning of a series of WTF moments..Tully then tells Margo she needs a night out because her roommate won't let her be a thot. Yeah, a really touching moment (!) They go out to a bar, get drunk and then go to a rock gig. All is well until Tully breaks the news she can't work with the family any longer and she isn't needed their anymore, she's satisfied her husband and made her feel good now she must just disappear, like an x rated Nanny Mcphee. wtf. Why did she do it that night? So many plot holes. But alas, it gets even worse.They argue a bit and then a scene takes place which can only be described as a breastfeeding fetishists dream... in a toilet at the club... Not even sure how to describe it.. just... wtf...Marlo decides to drive them home (despite being drunk) and falls asleep behind the wheel, they crash into the lake and then are rescued... by... mermaids (yes, really!) wtf.The ending attempts to be somehow heart warming and an insight into mental illness, nice try.

How the pressures of family life can lead to such insane, stressed and disconnected times. Charlize Theron's performance is nothing short of amazing. She is phenomenal in this film. And also had to look the part too.Although I'm a dad not a mum, the depiction of the whirlwind blur of parenthood really resonated with me....pretending everything is well to everyone, doing things that you think you should not the things you want. The routine, the monotony, the sacrifice of parenthood, it all culminates in an interesting 3rd act, which is a large tonal shift but a good one.

124,backofthevan,+++SPOILERS!*** So very disappointing!,5,7 May 2018,"On the pro side we have a beautifully nuanced performance by Charlize Theron as the stressed out mom who, though near breaking point, receives next to no help or support from her clueless husband. He'd rather pay violent video games in bed at night than relate in any way to his exhausted, overworked wife. Heaven forbid he should take any interest in her day, the lives of his children or his wife's needs. Put down that joystick, fool, and give her a back rub! I found myself seriously bored throughout this film, so much so that I felt annoyed. I went to see it because a member of my family is in it, but as a mother myself I felt I could probably relate to it and might find it entertaining. The scriptwriter being Diablo Cody was, I thought, a plus. Yes, there are a few mildly amusing lines, a few somewhat charming moments. However, painfully not enough to hold my interest.Tully herself was too forward for my liking. Waltzes in, bends down to get cozy with the new baby, tells Marlo to go to bed, and Marlo does! No questions about who the heck this woman is, where she comes from, what experience she has with babies (she's impossibly young looking for being a ""baby expert""), does she have references, etc. Nothing. Marlo just drags herself off up to bed, leaving her newborn downstairs in the care of this total stranger. When her lazy husband asks about leaving baby Mia with the unknown nanny, Marlo agrees that she did and that's good enough for Dad. He's not even interested enough to drag himself away from his video game to go see for himself. Nuts, both of them.Who this Tully is is never made clear, and some weird, disquieting things happen that don't ring true, demanding suspension of disbelief, which to me is just a filmmaking cop out. ""Oh, like that would ever happen,"" the viewer says, to which the filmmaker replies: ""Just go with it! It's just a movie!"" And what the heck are we to make of that bizarre ending? Tully (the film) takes a sudden gigantic leap into fantasy that is jarring and annoying. Was this the only way they could wrap this thing up? Throw on a Twilight Zone ending leaving the audience wondering ""What the what, now""?I left the theatre annoyed and shaking my head. They obviously think they're clever, these particular filmmakers, but leaving your audience baffled is insulting. I give Tully a generous 5/10, mostly for Charlize Theron's acting.",Tully

126,moveebuff1953,Motherhood,5,27 November 2018,"When considering having 2 or more children every woman should watch this movie. Motherhood is not easy unless you are super rich and can afford full time help. Otherwise like most of us you will find it physically and emotionally exhausting. Tully doesn't hold back on how difficult being a mother can be especially for women who feel they need to be ""on"" 24 x 7. Charlize Theron was perfect as the mom who is basically going through the motions not realizing it is taking a toll on her health. Mackenzie Davis (who I loved in Halt & Catch Fire) is the perfect alter ego who is just capable of doing everything and is always happy.
As with most husbands, they go off to work and don't realize the amount of stress and work involved in being a full time mom. Having 2 kids screaming for even 2 min can make you crazy.
I think Tully is a movie about the reality of motherhood taken to a dark point which many women experience with postpartum.
In conclusion ...would I recommend this movie? Probably not to anyone who hasn't had kids....they wouldn't understand anyway.",Tully
127,CriticalRaccoon,"A Touching Tale, A Terrible Twist",6,24 July 2020,"Tully ruins ""Tully.""That statement will make sense later, I think.The third collaboration between director Jason Reitman and writer Diablo Cody after ""Juno"" and ""Young Adult,"" and the second starring Charlize Theron, ""Tully"" delves into a deeply personal take on motherhood when it's lost its luster. Cody's one-liner snarky style remains, but it's also matched with a far more subtle approach than her previous efforts. Well, until the film decides to get cute with its themes and drives off a bridge, literally.Marlo (Charlize Theron) is days away from giving birth to her third child - an unplanned pregnancy at the age of 40. Marlo's a former New York hipster that got knocked up and lost her mojo along the way. Her 8-year-old insecure daughter is pretty tame but her 6-year-old son Jonah has a developmental disorder that's getting him kicked out of a private school because he is, as stated multiple times, ""too quirky"" for his teachers to handle. Marlo's husband Drew (Ron Livingston) is no help due to being swamped with work by day and disappearing to play video games at night. To say Marlo looks overwhelmed is an understatement and a testament to the ability of Charlize Theron to effortlessly glide between roles where she is an ultra-sexy secret agent in ""Atomic Blonde"" to being a disheveled wreck in this film. Theron nails this role - you can see her desperately trying to cover the cracks and keep it together even as the fissures start getting wider.Marlo's wealthy brother - married to a younger millennial hipster who had a much easier time with pregnancy and who had the joke subtlety of a sledgehammer to the uterus - offers to pay for a night nanny as a baby shower gift. Marlo refuses at first, but once her new kid arrives and the realities of 24-hour, zero sleep mothering take their tole on her she relents. Then, one night, Tully arrives.Tully (Mackenzie Davis) is a manic pixie dream girl of the nanny variety. A millennial Mary Poppins, Tully descends into Marlo's life and gives her exactly what she needs. Tully is a no-fuss, energetic, young beauty who is there to look after Marlo in every manner one can. Her entire job is to make Marlo feel alive again. Marlo and Tully have an instant connection which is solidified by the absurd chemistry of the two leads. They are a joy to watch together.Marlo's life immediately becomes better and it benefits the entire family. Marlo becomes more active, is better socially and even has the outward appearance of a parent who has it all under control. It's a rather shocking transformation; that one single person can affect another life so greatly is remarkable. Then, um, Tully happens.Not to give away the details, but for some absolutely absurd reason Diablo Cody decided a film about a mother needing help wasn't enough and had to get cute with a twist ending. Up until the last moments ""Tully"" was a pretty decent movie about accepting help and the need for self-care; unfortunately Cody must have just finished watching a certain other movie when writing the twist that wrecks ""Tully."" It's one of those twists that is sort of hinted at throughout the movie but does make some scenes make zero sense in retrospect. It's also a twist just for the sake of having a twist - you could easily have this movie exist without it. Maybe if ""Tully"" handled this better rather than just slapping it on I'd be okay with it, but Cody's choice does leave a rather abrupt sour taste in my mouth about a subject matter that could have been handled a lot better.I'm not the biggest fan of Diablo Cody's writing style but for the most part ""Tully"" worked well because it was so much more reflectively honest rather than trying to be a comedy. You can instantly tell ""Tully"" came from a very personal perspective. Theron's immense talents make Marlo relatable even without knowing much about her, and when she finally gets to act opposite Davis the screen becomes alive with these two ladies learning what drives them. There's a lot of good stuff here that illuminates a subject few films touch on. Well, it works as a character/theme piece, not so much a film about mental health. I wanted more of the parts that made ""Tully"" good, and less of the parts that accidentally turn serious mental health issues into a whimsical thing. Marlo is clearly a character who is struggling immensely - quite visibly at times too - yet Cody/Reitman treat this as hidden from everyone other than the audience and Tully.""Tully"" is also unexpectedly short. Most of the many subplots just get dropped about halfway in, with characters just vanishing and seemingly important developments left hanging. Marlo has the weight of the world on her shoulders as evidenced by how many subplots she juggles in her busy day, but the second Tully shows up these multiple plot threads either get forgotten or resolved in ways that are comically fast. The abruptness of the conclusion is almost shocking; it seems like it's missing a final act. ""Tully"" is barely 90-minutes and it needed another half-hour to feel like a whole movie.It's hard to fully recommend ""Tully"" without a few caveats, but it's worth a watch to see Theron and Davis' wonderful chemistry. I personally don't think ""Tully"" quite reaches the heights its pedigree would indicate, but it's still a worthwhile exploration of an aspect of parenthood that movies rarely touch on. Reitman and Cody give us an intriguing portrait of modern motherhood, but can't quite get the whole to reach the sum of its parts.",Tully

Well they aren't parents, or they don't get the movie. I thought this movie is definitely a great description of what you go through when having a child with a twist. Especially how the husband gets to sleep, while the mother has to do all the heavy lifting with a newborn. You start doubting your sanity, you don't feel sexy enough and never want to have sex, you look back on your life. Before you had kids. So the movie starts off shwoikg yoy Marlo's life with 2 kids and it's crazy. So now a newborn on the way, Marlo is going back and fourth debating to get a night nanny or not, because she feels it's weird to let someone else raise your child. Meanwhile her brother and annoying wife have the same amount of kids, but the brothers wife doesn't mind having nannies for her children. Not to mention they are rich and she's a typical rich wife. So you think the whole time she actually goes through with the night nanny, and they never ever let Marlo's husband actually meet the night nanny. It's always Marlo telling him about her, except the sex scene, but that was just actually Marlo the entire time,(I'll get back to that) you never hear him say Tully's name only Marlo says her name through the entire film. Not to mention a lot of women wouldn't be ok with their night nannies having sex with their husbands. She also starts becoming more awake, baking, cleaning, and making great dinners. All because she has this new night nanny ""Tully""! This is the spoiler at the end, you find out Tully was all just a illusion of a younger Marlo, she lost touch with reality. Due to lack of sleep, raising kids, and taking care of a newborn. That she made up a younger self and didn't realize she was the one doing it all. She even talked about how she once fell in love with her gf roommate but ended up living in suburbs with kids. But lives it again through Tully, she started living again only through Tully. Even having sex with her husband, her clueless husband. Who had never met Tully or even tried to help with the kids. Tully never existed and marlo clearly suffered with mental problems and on top of being sleep deprived. Made it all up! When you finally get to the end, the whole entire movie makes sense and you see that Tully was never there, it was just Marlo living 2 different lives in her head! I thought it was a fantastic twist and not close to a lifetime movie! I was shocked when I realized Tully was never there. It's not like anyone would have known but Marlo. Her husband worked, slept and played video games. No one offered to meet or ever saw Tully but Marlo! But the movie all comes together in the end and having a twist like that makes it different from other mommy having problems with kids movies! I thought it was better than Juno ans don't even know why people are comparing it to that.",Tully
130,kingsgrl2010,Possibly the Greatest Movie of Charlize Theron's Career,10,21 November 2018,"As a fan of Young Adult (also written By Diablo Cody and directed by Jason Reitman, and starring Charlize Theron) I thought this movie was going to be more of the same. A very dark dry comedy that leave you feeling uncomfortable but still stunned by Charlize's performance. This movie is so much more. It is laugh out loud funny throughout the whole film, you completely feel for Charlize's character Marlo, you feel her exhaustion, but also her love for her kids. It showcases motherhood in a way that is relatable to everyone. Mackenzie Davis is fantastic as Tully the nighttime nanny that comes to help out Marlo when her new baby is born. Tully's chemistry with Marlo is what keep the movie going, sometimes you need a friend in a time of need, even if she is only temporary. This is a movie that is pleasant as you watch it, gets a little darker as it goes, and by the end hits you with emotion you didn't see coming, but you fully understand and accept. Brilliantly done and one you should not miss.",Tully
131,blatherskitenoir,"This is NOT a comedy, or the portrayal of the average mom's ""real"" experience",7,6 May 2018,"People will show up expecting a more serious version of ""Bad Moms"" that might 'get real' and touch post-partum depression with a toothpick for half a second at its darkest. 
However, ""Tully"" is not light-hearted, is not a comedy, is not about PPD, and leaves you with a lingering, unsettled effect after watching. 
It begins as we think it should: with over-stressed, exhausted mom, Marlo, who is barely coping. Ah, we think, here is the embodiment of the ugly truth of motherhood at last! Marlo's body is a realistic post-pregnancy disaster, her house is filthy, the baby screaming, the older children demanding, and her husband is ok, but insufficiently supportive. It's all so very Real. All mothers in the audience will see themselves in Marlo's struggles. 
As the stresses pile on, Marlo begins to fissure. Cue the entrance of Tully, the night nanny generously paid for by her wealthy brother.
Our real-world Mary Poppins has arrived to save the family with girl-bonding hi-jinks and important messages on self-care!--we think. But Tully and Marlo's interactions are...off. Just slightly unsettling and odd, and you'll begin wondering What the heck is happening? 
As the film shades darker in the faintest of increments, we start feeling as if we've stepped into not-our-Walmart. You know, the feeling you get when you have to go to a Walmart that's not the one you always go to and the place feels like it's bad touching you a bit. Nothing is where you want it. You can't find anything. The thing that's always packaged in blue at home is now in green. Everything is familiar, but not in the right spot, and organized by a foreign logic. We see all the elements of the average ""mom"" story and tale of female friendship we want and were expecting, but they seem like not-our-Walmart. 
Kinky swinger sex and lesbian sexual tension act as shiny distractions that very nearly work to pull us away from realizing what the deeper, actual issue is. After the dramatic reveal, which many will not guess, but is amply foreshadowed, we have the standard tie-up ending we want and expect to happen. 
And then we go home, and wonder why our stomachs still hurts about what we just saw and think ""that was actually a much, much more serious, dire situation than the happy way they depicted it. And if these were real people, something truly bad, and very tragic, is going to happen 5 minutes after the credits stop, because that ending was not a real answer to the problem.""--that thought, and the accompanying feeling, are what make ""Tully"" effective as a film trying to convey a message on maternal mental health.",Tully

-----
This is a heartwarming drama about Marlo (really well-played by Theron), a mother of three--including a newborn--who's suggested to hire a night nanny by her brother. She's hesitant to the extravagance at first, but later she forms a unique bond with the charming, thoughtful, surprising, and sometimes challenging young nanny named Tully (Mackenzie Davis). There's nothing new about this movie plot and/or story as you will find the same difference in many other sort of drama genre, but Reitman presented it well with a little bit of comedy, plot twist--thanks to Diablo Cody, the script writer--and I love it.

It takes broad sweeping strokes and occasionally smacks you in the head just a bit to get the point across. It does this expertly with an elegant charm and without pandering to the audience. It can be infuriating at times to watch characters that seem to lack common sense, that seem to do exactly the opposite of what you want them to do, and that's the point! This film is empowering for women in a way that women should be empowered - finding your own inner strength without tearing out and discarding the girl inside you. Tully explores people as people for a change, and while some stand out as ""quirky"", we all have to own up to our individual quirks. Tully doesn't fit into a genre any more than you do.

People of color are facing extreme population decline and we all know how much this ""put people of color in power in the movies"" agenda is helping the unfortunate living in Chicago (64 murders last weekend alone).2) The lead actress hires a night nanny to help care for her newborn and for some insane reason, decides to party hard with here using alcohol and drugs. Later the two leading ladies decide to have a lesbian love affair and denigrate the hard working husband providing for his wife and children.3) Lastly, in a drunken drugged up stupor, the leading lady crashes her car into a river, almost dies, and while laying in intensive care, STILL craves her new lesbian lovers companionship.IMO, this film is just another typical sick, twisted waste of time packed with has-been actresses and filled with demented messages.If that's your cup of tea - enjoy it.

It's my understanding that Jason Reitman the director really damaged Theron's body by having her put 40 lbs of weight on for her part in this second rate piece. It's now impossible for her to lose all of it. She is no spring chicken and he shouldn't have put her in a spot where she is blabbing about it in second rate puff piece user question on NYT.com. Give her a break.Dir. Jason could have used a body double or a prosthesis. This is far from anyone involved's best work. So his actions display disregard for strong & empowered females everywhere.From what I see, this only serves to up-jump MacKenzie Davis (halt &catch fire (a vastly superior project)) to a transition to film and to burnish the director's indie credits. It failed and made collateral damage out of a great woman.Advice- don't do this for a crap picture like this 'tully' charlie. Total fluff made the rounds at festivals and got a higher meta score than it ought to. Garbage with next to nothing plot, runtime, or underlying message; or for that matter understandable content. Tully didn't make its budget back since it was of poor quality. See something else and retain your time. Would recommend charlize's work in such esteemed projects as monster fast and furious 6 or even long shot (with the overly honest and bumbling Seth).I usually only review films I've seen that spoke to me.

166,filmaniacist,Motherhood at its finest (worst),9,8 December 2018,"I saw this film months ago and recently I saw it for the second time, and I absolutely loved it.
It's all about Marlo and her extensive and quite surreal journey of
postnatal depression. Her third child enters the world and she embarks on a downward spiral ultimately aiming for rock bottom - the gist of the storytelling is that every character around her is failing her - her two older children are spoiled, inconsiderate (how could they not be at that age), her husband is a clueless businessman travelling, playing video games and seems unintelligible about the commitments of parenthood, the principal, who calls her son quirky and has to leave the school - everything revolving around her is building up to her final breakdown.
Until she decides to hire a night nanny - Diablo, excellent storyteller, depicts this side of motherhood (done great in Juno and Young Adult as well) and it's inevitable that one might encounter hallucinations or even worse, a mental illness, as did Marlo. This aspect of motherhood isn't presented in Hollywood,
with its raw and truthful experience, that I can't think of any film made as realisticly and accurate. Which makes the whole film worthy and interesting. Not to mention Charlize Theron's commitment (gained 50lb for the role) which furthermore added to her character - the depth of Marlo is what keeps the film interesting, the foundation of her actions and emotions are granted once you understand that being a mother is the toughest job in the world. Theron brings light to the character, emotionally invested in every scene that it's impossible to get bored throughout the film. Without Theron, it wouldn't be the same.

played nicely by McKanzie Davis, comes and their relationship is great.But there is a beef and that is the ending. The movie swerves into mermaids and fantasy.

It feels much more important to underline that Tully is a rare film with stunning writing and dialogue and acting, that takes the viewer through what it can feel like to be a mother of three children with rare sincerity, realism, lightness and freshness. Mostly, it just feels like we are there, we desperately want to lighten the load Marlo (Charlize) has on her hands, we are incredibly grateful for everything Tully (MacKenzie Davis - who is very far from Cameron Howe here, showing that she has great range on top of her talent) does for her.

177,acceberniah,Missing something,6,22 April 2020,"I enjoyed the film overall- the portrayal of Marlo's experience of an isolated and lonely motherhood was desperately sad and (although I'm not a parent!) I imagine it's very relatable. It unflinchingly showed the gritty side of being a mother that is rarely seen in cinema which I found refreshing and Charlize's performance feels so raw and real.The only thing that let this film down for me was the ending. I enjoyed the twist and was impressed to see postpartum psychosis shown on screen. But ultimately I feel like they could have made more of it, it almost felt as though this serious diagnosis was breezed over and in the end she was shown living relative normality with not even a suggestion that she would have been in therapy or on medication. Having not shied away from the harsh reality of parenthood it felt as though the film was let down by glossing over a poignant plot twist.",Tully

180,leroileveut-55-713320,1. lighting is terrible 2. people missed that SPOILER,1,6 January 2020,"Three observations, and I am not kidding about SPOILER:1. The costuming and makeup depts get a lot of credit for making Theron look ... bulky. There were lots of special effects since she is skinny.2. WTF. Yet another D*** movie where they couldn't be arsed to pay the electric bill for lights. Yeah, DVD, CRT, but save your money if you like to see what is going on, you can't most of the time. That is the reason for the 1 star. So they wanted to be cool and use available light----arrogant idiots.THE SPOILER IS NEXT. AVERT YOUR EYES.3. This is the spoiler. There was no Tully. This is a movie about a woman with post partum depression. She had a bad case after her autistic son was born (and how is it no one could figure out he is autistic, especially the screenwriter). After No. 3, she has an even worse case. A really really bad case. A case so bad she, what, disassociates, is that the word? Tully is her 26 year old self. Marlo dissociates because she can't handle everything. Her post partum psyche divides into her young helpful Tully self during the night and her ""normal"" mother of 3 adult Marlo self in the daytime, the two meeting at dawn and dusk, but her body doing double duty 24 hours a day. Tully exists only in Marlo's mind. The waitress costume scene--what little I could see of it BECAUSE IT WAS TOO DARK--all Marlo, her husband sees only his actual physical wife in the costume, which is why he was turned on. At the end, note, her brother was supposedly paying for the night nanny but he had no idea a nanny had been engaged, because one hadn't. Her husband didn't know much about ""Tully"" because he never met her, she didn't exist except in Marlo's mind. Did you note Marlo's maiden name was Tully. Yeah. And the doctor's diagnosis was extreme exhaustion and sleep deprivation...because the body was doing 24 a day duty.It might have been a pretty good movie IF THEY WOULD PAID THE ELECTRIC BILL FOR LIGHTS.",Tully
181,serendipity163,An authentic take on motherhood,7,8 May 2018,"I'll start with the acting. Mothers are clearly the focus; you barely notice the characters Mark Duplass and Ron Livingston play. Charlize Theron is great, I mean I'm slightly biased because I admire her work, but I really think she did a fantastic job. She plays the role of Marlo with such conviction, creating empathy, pathos and humour with almost every line. Mackenzie Davis' take on the titular role was good, but I wasn't sold on her vivacious attitude and I could tell she was acting. I love when an actor is so fully immersed in a character that you forget that they're even playing a role...this wasn't the case with Davis. The ending...so it turns out that Tully wasn't real and was actually a physical manifestation of Marlo's younger self (Tully being her maiden name). Whilst I was surprised by the turn in narrative, I had my suspicions. Marlo mentioned she majored in English Literature, and then Tully too casually quoted Samuel Pepys. The awkward meeting between Marlo and her old roommate and then Tully's musings about her difficult relationship with her roommate. And what nanny would partake in a threesome with her employers...? So it wasn't exactly a shocking revelation but an interesting one. The ending seems to have angered a lot of people, with respect to the way the film portrayed and dealt with postnatal depression. As someone who hasn't had children or suffered from a mental illness in relation to childbirth, I can't comment on something I have no experience of. But one thing I will say is that I wish it had been explored in more depth. Mental illness, an extremely important issue, was revealed at the end in quite a drastic way (the car crash) and then the film basically finishes. Well we get a short farewell between Marlo and Tully, which I think was meant to represent her coming to terms with her illness while also appreciating how it may have helped her through a tough moment in motherhood. And then BAM, Marlo's back home. And she's spending time with her son and making lunches with her husband...it just felt very rushed. I mean, maybe that's the point? That when mothers are suffering, they put it aside and get on with life for the benefit of their children...? Who knows? I certainly don't, but there's no harm in speculating.",Tully

Early in the movie I was impressed with Theron's sympathy invoking portrayal of Marlo, especially with her handling of the situation with her son, amidst her overwhelming (and tiring) home life. However, the relationship with Tully initially held my attention, as it kept me guessing. As this relationship moved on, it caused my '8' review number to drop rapidly.

Charlize Theron carries the movie amazingly, as always. Mackenzie Davis supports her beautifully as the titular character as well. Tully scores big for its honest portrayal of a struggling mother. It isn't afraid to go where it wants to go - and that kind of unabashed storytelling is amazing...But then, it presents a twist that I am not sure works. My reviews are spoiler free, so I won't dive into it, but I'm not convinced this was always the working ending. I think they could have concluded the movie in a different way that would allow the tale to become a classic. This way, it's a see-it-once and never again kind of movie, in my opinion.Definitely worth seeing, but a little too shocking for its own good.",Tully

The interactions between the mother Marlo and her 'night nanny' Tully are engaging, enough, funny and uplifting after Marlo has struggled juggling her life, daughter, mildly autistic son and now newborn girl and neglected, doting husband.

206,buckeyekev,NOT A COMEDY!,3,7 September 2018,"Why anyone would refer to this as a COMEDY I have no idea. Like with most movies there are a few funny moments or light moments but the overall theme is no where near Comedic.More like mental tragedy!I actually liked the ""The Sixth Sense"" twist/reveal as it explained a lot of weird incongruities to that point. My girlfriend actually picked up on a tell when her brother doesn't seem to ""know she has engaged the night nanny"" when he would have been getting billed for her by that point. I told her maybe it was a pre-pay thing or the bill was just delayed/lagged but it ended up she was right to think that was a tell.In retospect, if she was up cleaning and cooking cupcakes and doing all that the ""nanny"" was supposed to have done, her husband would have noticed she was almost never in bed. I know the guy was supposed to be selfish and un-knowing but come on, if she had been up most of the night every night he would KNOW! He can't be that un-aware! Plus she did really seem to be physically and mentally better - to everyone. I know that is part of the deception but her breakdown would have been gradual and not ""looks better"" then ""hits a wall/off-bridge"".I would think her doctors and family would monitor her more closely since she had evidently had problems after her son was born. They really should have tried the night nanny thing. Most new moms have some help from the grandmothers or someone. Since she knew her hubby wasn't much of a help she could have reached out much more sooner. Kind of a movie that pointed toward family planning and the need for birth control for some people! Go batty after your son with some form of Autism is born, and then have a 3rd kid when you are struggling with 2 already? Screams for responsible parenting decisions and ""choice""!",Tully

I thought it was really great, but if you're desperate for the whole thing to be a laugh-fest it will totally take away the punch this packs. It's more of a drama that peppers in some normal life humor. Maybe some of the ideas here have been explored before but this takes on a class of its own if you are able to truly connect and relate to Marlo.

Initially, I thought the movie was going to be a run-of-the-mill story, with ups and downs ending in a feel good message - I was very wrong. This movie had the ability to portray motherhood in a very real light while also adding in all the aspects of filmmaking that make a story-line captivating.

The movie wanted to show how moms struggle and stuff, which is amazing if you think about it this way. However I really really didn't like the ending, it's so confusing and kinda lost me hanging",Tully
221,NativeParanormalSeekers,Great Movie to Watch if Your a Mother who Tries to Do It All,8,27 March 2020,"This is one of my favorite movies done with Charlize Theron, it's hard to make her look tired let alone ugly (Monster Ball) until it ends so fast leaving you with ""What Just Happened""?
This movie shows the hardships most mothers have to endure even if they didn't have a special needs child.
There were some parts that made you smile Although I wouldn't say this movie is comedy and there were some dramatic parts, but I wouldn't say it's a dramatic movie either, or suspense.
You do think something is up at the very end when Marlo has a car accident that ends in the water upside down with Tully and you don't see Tully in the car with Marlo when she wakes up.
Also, when Marlo is in the hospital, her husbands mentions to the Dr. he has no idea where the night nanny Tully is. Tully later shows up without a scratch.
I did have to watch the movie carefully again to be convinced, because the first time I was saying ""Was Tully not Real""?
I say that because when the movie does its flashback, it shows moments where Marlo is alone and there never was a Tully, but there were moments Marlo was alone when Tully was there with her, for instance when Marlo is looking at the baby in the bassinet, she is alone right before Tully walks in, yet in the flashback they use that as a reference that Tully was never there, also when Marlo is in the bar alone, you never see her have that fruity drink because, when she's with Tully it was always a hard mixed alcohol. Another instance that supposedly convincing us Tully never existed, the flashback, you see Marlo riding down the street alone, on a bike she stole outside the bar, but you do see Marlo alone right before Tully is seen catching up to Marlo, riding on a bike Tully also stole as well. All these flashbacks weren't enough to convince me Marlo was always alone and Tully never existed because there were instances Marlo was without Tully, I need to see Marlo having conversations with herself and moments she was with Tully and Marlos alone, not cheat retakes of moments Marlo is with Tully and Tully's out of shot for a few seconds!
The director never really convinced me that Tully was never really there and Marlo made it up, the only believability was when her husband mentions Tully was Marlo's maiden name, so it does leave you ending with a cheap, what just happened...??",Tully

223,overdoggg,Reitman/Cody do it again,9,14 July 2020,"Reitman and Cody raised the bar almost impossibly high with Young Adult, which I found to be a minor masterpiece. Luckily they once more knocked it out of the park with their latest effort as Tully is every bit as brave, richly textured and thoughtprovoking as Young Adult. Having become a father a few years ago I can relate to the absloute chaos that descends on one's life after the birth of a child. The upheaval of one's inner sanctum, the fatigue, the sudden heights of selflessness one is forced to rise to. The most insidious change of all however is the irrevocable end of that part of life that is characterized by freedom, excitement and spontaneity. Life quickly reverts to a dull drudgery that few are prepared for, with depression all too often rearing it ugly head. All this is very realistically portrayed in Tully.
But rather than simply reel off a series of vignettes that depict life when married with children, the movie employs a very clever and effective plot that ends up packing quite an emotional punch. Without giving too much of the plot away the story is not simply one to be taken at face value and the twist at the end really offers up some food for thought.
I applaud Reitman and Cody for making movies that satisfy the eye, the intellect and the heart all in one sitting and my hope is that they will continue their collaboration in the years to come.",Tully

235,markrkelley,A very big small movie.,10,14 May 2018,"Theron plays an overwhelmed, pregnant, middle-aged mother with a bright little daughter and an (unspoken) autistic son. She is married to a nice guy who is more into video games than being a husband. When her third is born, the endless exhaustion drives her to the breaking point. In comes Tully, a night nanny. She is everything Theron needs and then some. Tully becomes a counselor, night manager, best friend, and caregiver. She is a godsend to an overworked and over-stressed mother.But Tully doesn't exist. She is the product of Theron's psychotic break. However, in this film she isn't like any of Ebeneezer Scrooge's ghosts. She has more depth and a deep secret not revealed until nearly the end.The movie reminded me of Silver Linings Playbook in that while SLP did an excellent job of portraying the detached-from-reality life of a sufferer of bipolar disorder, Tully gives us the full-blown fantasy that can be a severe psychotic break. In both movies, the main character cannot separate reality from their own fiction. And both movies give you satisfying endings.As a psychology instructor, I came away really liking this film for its fair portrayal of a person in crisis whose mind creates a living solution to her most pressing problems.My wife, a nurse of 38 years and a mother of two, also liked it.",Tully
236,Gr8shpr,Great acting; who or what undid the seatbelt?,6,11 August 2018,"My comments echo most of those already written. This was not a comedy in any sense of the word. It brought back painful experiences for me (a mom).
 
However, the acting was so superb...I do love MacKenzie Davis (""Halt and Catch Fire""); and Charlize Theron is quite fabulous.The merging of Tully and Marlo seemed like a brilliant idea. The thought that the young, inner self and it's far-ranging interests is suppressed is enough to put one into a psychosis right there.I feel that Marlo's water dreams of a being who eventually plays a part in her rescue rates some thoughts, although I haven't found any discussion about this.",Tully
237,elliotr-38088,A perfect 10!!!,10,10 August 2018,"One of my favorite indie films of the year and a painful/riveting look into motherhood. Hard to believe that this movie was directed by a man, but Jason Reitman (Juno) did an amazing job on this film.",Tully
238,clarepilkington-86597,Perfect!,10,16 August 2018,Beautiful film- not 100% sure why US drs would not identify son as autistic or Asperger's Syndrome rather than atypical- but otherwise perfect portrayal of the bizarre world of parenthood/motherhood post birth.,Tully

240,igor-186,Tully is an alter ego!,8,18 December 2018,"A woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown. A young son with hyperactivity creates problems for his mother and at school. In this case, the third one will be born. Huge belly, childbirth, constantly crying newborn. Milk, which must be decanted regularly. A husband who is hiding in the bedroom behind a game console or on business trips. Everything is very naturalistic. Too? No, these problems can be in reality. Yet immediately and bring it to ...Suddenly, out of nowhere (on recommended), a night nanny is taken from the appearance of which the child stops crying. Prior to that, shouting without ceasing, and then no, no. No sound. The nanny was not only a nanny, but also a hidden psychotherapist. She helped with the housework, in love for herself, in relations with her husband, and having adjusted everything disappeared. In the finale of conjugal idyll.Tips: 1) mother baked cupcakes, 2) maiden name, 3) diagnosed lack of sleep, 4) nanny without injuries, 5) dreams of water.That's just not clear how a woman having gone to unreal managed to fix everything, and not lose her mind.",Tully
241,yuri-fm,Quirky,6,13 October 2018,"Fight Club: Mother's Edition. You can see where the plot's going from 1000 miles away, but it's still a good film. Mackenzie Davis was great in it.",Tully
242,cyberspaceplan,Insulting to women,3,12 May 2018,"This movie is insulting to women. She is not worth anything and should have no self esteem unless she is a size two after giving birth, able to be up all night and all day, have the patience of a saint, cook an incredible dinner for hubby and family, keep the house immaculate, and be great in the sack.",Tully
243,Rosebud421,THIS IS NOT A COMEDY,9,3 August 2018,"This is a beautifully acted, well written film. I believe some people who disliked it were expecting a comedy and therefore disappointed. It seems more a psychological drama about a woman who is so sleep deprived, stressed out and unsupported by her spouse, she actually creates a nanny (her younger self) to help her cope. I liked it, much as I liked the Sixth Sense. Somewhere along the line, you have to see the clues. Bruce Willis character is dead and Tully isn't real. Tully, we find out later in the film, is Marlo's maiden name, when she arrives she is much younger than expected, they hit it off like best pals despite the age difference, Marlo said she didn't want a stranger in the house at night and yet she trusts this young girl immediately, her husband doesn't even go downstairs to meet the nanny, when the car crashes into the water Marlo is alone in the car....there are endless clues that Tully doesn't exist. 
I hope the fine acting is remembered at Oscar time.",Tully

Despite the fantastic performances of the cast the narrative of a strung out Mum in desperate need of more support from her husband left me upset and feeling odd for the remainder of the day! 
Poor Show from the marketing team on this one!!",Tully

And how the principal of a school can call a clearly autistic child ""quirky"" is beyond me. Great performances. Not so great plot.",Tully
256,suzannedoberneck,Surprising tear-jerker,9,31 August 2018,"I adored this film. You will, too. Charlize is fantastic and you've seen the nanny on Black Mirror. She's also a very well balanced character. The ending really got me in the feels.",Tully
257,sophiec-96659,Strange and Unexpected,5,4 May 2018,"My reaction to this movie was similar to my reaction to the trailer: I walked away confused as to what it was all about. As a fan of Juno, I was looking forward to a light-hearted comedy on the surface with just the right amount of emotional depth. Instead I was treated to an hour and a half of a zombified Charlize Theron (completely failing to convince me of her motherhood status) meandering her way through a landscape of disorienting tone shifts and half-explored plot lines, peppered with forced jokes and blatant exposition that further detracted from the already mediocre experience. At first, it seemed to be a peek into the daily life of a mother, with a heartwarming note about ditching pride and accepting help. The second half, however, descended through a series of strange scenes to an utterly bizarre finale. Any worthwhile messages intended by the creators were lost amidst the jumble of plot elements, lifeless acting, and lack of chemistry and believability in each of the relationships (Marlo and Tully, Marlo and her husband, Marlo and her kids). Overall, it just failed to come together into anything solid.",Tully

259,joyapando,It Started Out So Well...,1,28 July 2018,"The portrayal of an overwhelmed Mom in the beginning was spot on. It really hit home with me. I think it's a lot of Moms' worst fear that they're going to crack and go crazy under all the pressure, and guess what? - she did. She slipped into what appears to be a postpartum psychosis, and almost kills herself. Then do they show her taking ANY steps to get healthy? Nope. They make light of it, and show her hobbling around with a cane at the end which is a reference to how bad Lifetime movies end that was mentioned earlier. The acting was amazing, I'll give it that. But, this has done nothing to dispel the stigma of postpartum mental illness. They had a platform here, and were careless with it. And don't even get me started on the antiquated portrayal of the useless Dad.",Tully
260,alev-4,Incredibly Misleading Promotion,6,7 May 2018,"This is NOT a comedy. It is a depressing depiction of immediate post-birth motherhood. Performances are excellent, especially Theron's. Not recommended except to those who want a drama.",Tully
