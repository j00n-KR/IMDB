0,Leofwine_draca,Another missed opportunity,3,14 January 2011,"I absolutely hated the first AVP but when I heard this sequel was going back to basics, focusing on adult horror rather than PG-13 scares (and with no human-friendly Predators in sight), I thought it ought to be better than the first. It is – but only just.The problem is the script. It's as bland, senseless and unengaging as the previous film's, with the only difference being that the gore ante is upped slightly. Thus this time we see plenty of chest-bursting scenes and blood splashing around. It doesn't make the film any more entertaining, though.I really don't understand why they bother with the human cast in these films – the characters are inevitably soulless, bland and interchangeable, and if we're supposed to care about whether any of them live or die then it doesn't work. They just distract from the main interest, which is Predator vs Alien action. Unfortunately a pair of siblings named the Brothers Strause are the guys who shot this, and they display little discernible talent. The various action scenes are badly edited and the whole film is about ten times too dark, meaning you can barely make out what's going on.At various times I recognised sound effects and/or music which are ripped off from both PREDATOR and ALIENS, but the inclusion of these only serves to remind the viewer just how good those original movies were...",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1,SnoopyStyle,some horrific stuff going on which is fine by me,5,29 December 2015,"Following AVP, the Predator ship is leaving earth. An Alien hybrid erupts from the Predator dead body and the ship crashes into the woods of Gunnison County, Colorado. An emergency signal is sent to the Predator planet and a lone Predator is dispatched. The Aliens escape from the crashed ship and start impregnating the locals. Both the Predator and the locals must battle the rampaging Aliens with the new hybrid leader.There are some horrific stuff going on in this movie and that's great. A little boy gets it Kane-style. The stuff in the maternity ward is pretty nasty. I'm glad that they stop trying to connect with the original Aliens by including Bishop. However none of the new characters are terribly compelling. Returning military helicopter pilot Kelly O'Brien (Reiko Aylesworth) is probably the only character of note. The teenagers are weak. The sheriff is forgettable. O'Brien and the Predator are the only interesting characters. This does have some solid B-horror action.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
2,claudio_carvalho,A Deadly Extraterrestrial Battle,6,31 August 2008,"In Gunnison County, a spacecraft crashes in the woods bringing a powerful hybrid Alien hosted inside the pilot Predator. The local Buddy Benson (Kurt Max Runte) and his son Sam (Liam James) are hunting in the forest and witness the crash, but they are chased and killed by the Alien. Meanwhile another Predator lands on the spot seeking out the Alien and destroying the evidences of their presence on Earth. The dwellers of the town find themselves in the middle of a battlefield between the two deadly extraterrestrial creatures, and the small group of survivors splits the leadership between Sheriff Eddie Morales (John Ortiz) and the bad-boy Dallas Howard (Steven Pasquale) that have different opinions about the best means to escape from the beings.""AVPR: Aliens vs Predator  Requiem"" is a forgettable but entertaining and decent movie. The story is predictable, using the usual clichés of the genre and supported by great special effects and make-up, and a dark cinematography. The direction and acting are reasonable and in the end this film is not as bad as indicated in many reviews. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Aliens vs Predador 2"" (""Aliens vs Predator 2"")",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
3,classicsoncall,"""It was a monster.""",5,15 May 2012,"It's hard for me to imagine how a classic sci-fi/horror concept like 1979's original ""Alien"" could have degenerated into the mindless story presented here almost three decades later. Quite honestly, because the film was so dark I couldn't tell what was going on a good part of the time, and actually got more out of reading some of the other reviews here than from watching the picture itself. You would think the film makers would attempt to honor the legacy of the originals and come up with some compelling story line, but this was simply an over the top exercise in gratuitous violence that spared no one in it's relentless path. The casting followed the same principal as all those cabin in the woods movies where a lunatic with an axe on the loose is going to get you sooner or later. Not only was the action repetitious and predictable, but if you watch the film with captions on like I do, you'll find that they follow the same pattern too. My favorites were (eerie hissing), (ominous theme playing), and best of all, (guttural croaking); they must have used that last one a half dozen times. Even the title is oddly inappropriate because once you've seen it, you'll come to realize that it never had a prayer.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
4,jboothmillard,AVPR: Aliens vs. Predators - Requiem,4,19 September 2010,"The critics gave it a low rating of two stars out of five, and I was told by a few people it was rubbish because it was too dark and could hardly see anything, so I decided to put that opinion to the test. Basically, it picks up where AVP: Alien vs. Predator left, after the birth of the new Alien/Predator hybrid, and in the little town of Gunnison County, in the Colorado hills, crashes the Predator spaceship. In the ship are jars of the hideous Alien facehuggers ready to impregnate innocent human victims, and soon enough they get lucky and more Aliens are born to join in the on-coming battle. Predators back in outer space get indication of the spaceship crash on Earth, so they whizz down to see what's going on, and of course they know that the battle is on between them and the Aliens. The humans of the town, including ex-convict Dallas Howard (Steven Pasquale), his younger brother Ricky (Johnny Lewis), Ricky's love interest Jesse (Kristen Hager), army servicewoman Kelly O'Brien (Reiko Aylesworth) and her daughter Molly (Ariel Gade) are caught right in the middle of this destructive battle. The Predators are shooting and stabbing and the Aliens are dribbling the acidic liquids and chompers, both all over the place, and it is getting worse with every move the creatures make. The National Guard are brought in to try and get the situation under control, but even they are unable to stop the creatures in their war, and there is no choice but to destroy the town with a nuclear device. In the end, the few survivors that chose the right way to survival are caught by the authorities, and one of the Predator weapons that one the human clan used is given to some scientific experts, this may continue in another sequel. Also starring John Ortiz as Morales, True Blood's Sam Trammell as Tim, Chelah Horsdal as Darcy, David Paetkau as Dale, Gina Holden as Carrie and Robert Joy as Col. Stevens. I will credit this film was some good cool points, it is a little shocking to see a child impregnated by the face hugger and it blasting out, and an already pregnant woman giving birth to the Alien babies is nasty too. As for the film itself, it wasn't completely terrible, I can see what people mean about the darkness aspect, but I was just a little drawn in at times by how much violence was going on between both the creatures and the humans, so a reasonable science-fiction action thriller. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Excuse for a Horror Movie and Worst Prequel or Sequel. Okay!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
5,Tweekums,Not good at all,3,20 September 2010,Having enjoyed the original Alien films including the less than popular Alien³ and Resurrection and to a lesser extent the two Predator films I thought I might enjoy the Alien Vs Predator films too despite hearing that they were terrible. I watched the first a while back and thought it was just about okay but this one was just dire.When a Predator ship carrying a load of Alien face-huggers crashes in the woods outside a small American town a couple of hunters are soon impregnated and in no time at all there are aliens killing the locals. At first they are just picking off one or two isolated individuals at a time without raising any real suspicions but soon they are killing anybody they can. A predator comes in to clean up any evidence of the aliens' presence or any witnesses. The townsfolk that we see are mostly teens or at twenty somethings who mostly there to look pretty and then die.I didn't recognise any of the cast and can't imagine any of them going on to be major stars like those featuring in the original films although Ariel Gade who played the small girl wasn't bad and could scream like a pro. It didn't help that none of their characters were particularly interesting and most people were killed off before we could care about them. It didn't even work as a gory shock-fest as the whole film was so dark that it was hard to see what was going on. It is sad to think that a classic sci-fi/horror series ended like this; it was closer to a second rate '80s slasher flick with monsters instead of psychos than science fiction; in fact the sci-fi/slasher film 'Jason X' was better than this.,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
6,ma-cortes,Aliens battle Predators on Earth where unsuspecting residents realize that something horrible is stalking their little town,5,13 February 2015,"Spectacular but mediocre Aliens/Predators movie set in a little town where a motley group takes on extraterrestrial monsters . As warring alien and predator races descend on a small town, where unsuspecting residents must band together for any chance of survival and they find themselves caught up in a battle between the two legend beings .Stirring but inferior sequel with plenty of thrills , chills , suspense , disgusting special effects and lots of blood and gore . In fact , this is the second Alien film, and also the first Predator film, to get a rating other than R . It was decided at an early stage that this movie would be R-rated as ""it is what the fans want from the series"". Moving and thrilling screenplay by Shane Salerno based on ""Alien"" characters created by Ronald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon as well as ¨Predator"" characters created by Jim Thomas and John Thomas . This is the first movie in both the Predator and the AVP-based movies that actually feature scenes of the Predators' home planet. It was at one time hoped to include scenes of the Aliens' home world ; conceptual art was created and it was even storyboarded to be used as the closing shot of the movie, but ultimately the idea was dropped in favor of using it in a potential third film . ¨Aliens versus predators¨ I and II were a project that had floated around for about 10 years , it was only when director Paul W.S. Anderson and Strause Brothers did his verbal pitch to the suits at 20th Century Fox that anyone showed any real interest . This horrifying as well as heart-pounding movie contains shocks , stomach-churning violence , filled with action , thrills and results to be pretty entertaining . This nail-biting picture contains tension from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , thrills , some strong scares , slime , emotion , entertainment and so-so acting . It is an acceptable though middling cinematic combination of Sci-Fi , monster movie and terror . This is a brutal , considerable violent and exciting sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of the 70s , 80s , 90s and 2000s . The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with an unknown though passable cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters . Based on the comic books by writer Mark Verheiden, creator of the first Alien vs Predator comic series and the first story involving both species , contrary to popular belief, the comic was released prior to the infamous shot of the alien ""skull"" in Predator 2 (1990) . The Alien vs. Predator story crossed over virtually all forms of media before becoming a feature film . There was a successful comic book series, toy line, multiple video games, soundtrack of the PC game and even a trading card series . Breathtaking as well as bloody slaughter sequences took long time to shoot and were extremely difficult to make . Magnificently designed creatures , originally created by the artist HR Giger . Top-notch special effects by SFX designer Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr ; the latter has a brief cameo , in fact this is special effects maestro Tom Woodruff's fourth time in the alien costume . The Animatronics were controlled by a motion-control rig which could save her movements digitally . The ending part is particularly exciting with our protagonists battling the malicious aliens as well as brutal predators and with impressive scenes that took various weeks to film . ¨Aliens vs. Predator 2¨ (2007) by Strause Brothers has a decent but little known cast such as Steven Pasquale , Reiko Aylesworth , John Ortiz , Johnny Lewis , Kristen Hager , Ariel Gade , Sam Trammell , Gina Holden , Ty Olsson and Robert Joy . The picture packs an original music by Brian Tyler , plenty of frightening and stirring sounds . However ,some score and sound effects from previous films in both franchises were used in this film . Colorful but dark cinematography by Daniel Pearl with several scenes filmed at night . The motion picture was regularly directed by Colin Strause and Greg Strause both wanted the film to be 3-D, however the idea was dropped, because it would be too expensive. Being shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada ; according to directors , if they'd filmed in Hollywood, the sets would have cost them $20 million .There was seven years between the release of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), six between Aliens and Alien 3 (1992), and five between Alien³ and Alien resurrection (1997). The original and the best was ¨Alien¨ by Ridley Scott , it was starred by Sigourney Weaver as a great action woman similarly to Sanaa Lathan ; it is followed by ¨Aliens ¨, also visually astounding by James Cameron with Paul Reiser , Jenette Goldstein , Lance Henriksen ; and this Alien . All of them starred by the great Sigourney Weaver who performed one of the best female leads created in years followed by Sanaa Lathan . Furthermore, ¨Alien vs. Predator¨ (2004) that was first film in the ""Alien"" franchise to not feature Sigourney Weaver, who has said in interviews the idea of the crossover ""sounded awful and ¨Aliens vs. Predator ¨ (2007) by Paul W.S. Anderson with Sanaa Lathan , Raoul Bova , Ewen Bremner , Tommy Flanagan , Joseph Rye . The original and the best ¨Predator¨ (1987) by John McTiernan in which Arnold leads a team of CIA-hired mercenaries into the Central American jungles with Jesse Ventura , Bill Duke , R.G. Armstrong , Carl Weathers , Elpidia Carrillo who appears briefly in ¨Predators II¨ with Bill Paxton , Danny Glover , Ruben Blades and ¨Predators¨ (2010) by Nimród Antal with Adrien Brody , Topher Grace , Alice Braga and Walton Goggins",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
7,BA_Harrison,At least it's better than Alien Resurrection (but then what isn't?).,5,19 July 2010,"Paul W.S. Anderson's 2004 franchise crossover Aliens vs Predator may have had many fans of the two long running and popular sci-fi series frothing with rage, but I liked it: it at least had something resembling a plot, featured an interesting arena for the action (a cool ancient underground pyramid), and boasted some decent special effects—plus the film remained true to its predecessors by being targeted at an adult audience.This follow-up has also received something of a critical mauling from Predator and Alien fans, but this time I don't find it that hard to understand why: the film-makers have given us a virtually plot less, teen-orientated popcorn flick, set in an 'Anywhere-ville' rural town populated by a clichéd set of characters, complete with town rebel Dallas (Steven Pasquale), young high school couple Ricky (Johnny Lewis) and Jesse (Kristen Hager, who is hot, Hot, HOT!), and a Ripley-style female soldier and her little girl (who they might as well have named Newt, and been done with it). It's dumb violent fun for an undemanding audience, but hardly a worthy entry in the series.SFX guys turned directors Colin and Greg Strause are clearly very comfortable with the film's many CGI and traditional special effects, but the pair display little understanding of how to tell a decent story; thus we get a collection of impressive smack-downs between the titular monsters and a few gory deaths, but very little of substance to tie them all together.Requiem also makes too much of the whole 'Alien absorbing DNA from its host' for my taste, offering viewers a fully grown xenomorph/predator hybrid; since I've never really been a fan of this whole concept (it just doesn't sit right with me), seeing an alien sporting dreadlocks is particularly unsettling. It makes one wonder what would happen if a face-hugger used a sheep as its host: would we get an alien covered in wool that bleats?4.5 out of 10, happily rounded up to 5 for the scene in which the lovely Kristen Hager kindly strips down to her skimpy swimming costume.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
8,paul_haakonsen,Lots of action...,6,29 December 2015,"""Alien vs Predator: Requiem"" is in my opinion a good entry to the alien and predator franchises, and I found it to be an entertaining movie despite the fairly low rating it had scored on IMDb.I especially liked the glimpse we were given of the home-planet of the predator species. This movie does also give the audience all the alien and predator action that you could possibly ask for. And as a continuation of the first ""Alien vs Predator"" movie then you, of course, have the predalien - the predator/alien hybrid that bursts from the chest of a predator in the first movie. And how was this predalien creature? I found it to work quite well.Story-wise then ""Alien vs Predator: Requiem"" wasn't the most solid or thought through of movies. It was entertaining for what it was though, just don't expect anything profound or overly stimulating for the intellect.The effects in the movie were good, as they should be to make a movie with both aliens and predators work out as intended. And the creature effects were fantastic. For a movie like this, the creature effects have to be top notch, otherwise it would be a death sentence to the movie.""Alien vs Predator: Requiem"" is an entertaining movie and does cater well to the fans of the alien and predator franchises alike.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
9,michaelRokeefe,Extraterrestials battle it out in Colorado.,4,25 November 2015,"Colin and Greg Strause make directorial feature debut with this Sci-fi flick. If you like gore and guns; and ugly, but neat creatures trying to kill each other...this is your movie. A crippled Predator ship makes a crash landing in the woods of Crested Butte, Colorado. Insectoid little monsters make haste with little waste of citizens in the small community. A Predator warrior arrives to do battle with the aliens and an alien-Predator hybrid called a Predalien. Most of the action, and there is plenty, takes place in the dark of night during a heavy rainstorm. This is bad, because you can't really make out which bad-ass creature is doing the most damage to the other. Frantic action makes up for lack of dialogue. Although there is some eye-candy. But hey, this is a creature feature! I guess that is the proper category. I've seen a whole lot better; but then I've also seen plenty worse.Starring are: Steven Pasquale, Reiko Aylesworth, John Ortiz, Kristen Hager and Michael Suchanek.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
10,hitchcockthelegend,Remember when chest busters were scary?,1,4 March 2008,"This stinks, it really does, and this coming from a man who owns and loves many a cheese filled B/Z movie. Although I would in no way say that AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004) was a good movie, I have a tiny soft spot and found it watchable at least, this hack job makes that film seem like the pinnacle of creature feature nirvana. A Predator ship encounters problems on board by way of a newly born predator/alien hybrid, it crash lands on Earth (America) and thus Requiem is born as face huggers go crazy, aliens run amok, predator fights back, and the cast of genre stereotypes kill or be killed, the end! All the makers have done here (apart from attempting to kill off the franchise it seems) is splice together various staples from the other films in the series. Be it the settings or confrontations, they have just upped the blood quota, the film has no substance what so ever. Characters so dense and unlikeable you root for the monsters by way of having no choice, dumb teens in angst, Rambo mom, ex-convict trying to do good, you name it and chances are you have seen it in other rubbish murder death kill movies. There is gore galore which I'm sure will appease the easily pleased, and in one particularly monstrous scene involving a pregnant woman, a sequence for the squeamish to chat on the playground about come Monday morning. But you honestly would be better off watching some cheap no budget slasher film from the 70s, because unlike the money backed hack directors here, they had an excuse back then.

11,Theo Robertson,Let There Be Light,3,19 September 2010,"It's always difficult to try a new spin on a film franchise . Several decades ago they were simply produced as B movies to be screened before the main feature . The Frankenstein franchise suffered from this . James Whale's 1931 FRANKENSTEIN was a classic , likewise BRIDE which surpassed even the original . The series did eventually descend in to a cynical and silly exercise where characters and situations were resurrected just for the sake of it . Whilst the original PREDATOR is remembered as being not much more than a star vehicle for Arnold Schwarzenegger both ALIEN and its sequel are considered the very finest examples of Sci-Fi horror one can compare how the ALIEN franchise ended up similar to the universal horrors of the 1930s/40s .REQUIEM gets off to a very bad start . An alien bursts out of a Predator and kills the crew of a spaceship . Not being able to to remember a single thing about the previous ALIEN VS PREDATOR might confuse the audience , if you're making a sequel it helps if the sequel is self contained . ALIENS did this , as did 28 WEEKS LATER . Even a masterwork of cinema such as THE GODFATHER PART TWO managed it . It's not difficult in the case of a horror film - all you have to do is use some expositional dialogue summing up the events in the previous film . If the protagonists at the start of the film aren't human and don't speak any recognisable Earth language this makes things a bit more difficult but I'm sure both the studio executives and the screenwriters can have a discussion getting round this . Considering the money they're investing in the project it shouldn't be too difficult I'd have thought What makes this imperative is that the Alien that bursts out of the Predator grows up to become a "" Predalien "" a hybrid of the two species .. The unfortunate thing about this plot point is that it's never clearly explained on screen that this is what the monster is . Would it be too honest to admit that I never knew this until I looked it up on wikipedia ? I feel no shame in confessing this and if someone has to find out what's happening in a film by consulting the wikipedia instead of it being explained on screen then you know you're watching an atrocity of a movie This confused , almost contemptuous story telling means that the casual audience are totally perplexed by the events . A Predalien breaks in to a maternity wing of a hospital and impregnates eggs in to pregnant women who then give birth to more Predaliens . The problem with this from the audiences point of view is that they think they're watching a Preadator impregnating women who in turn give birth to Aliens so it's a scene amongst many that doesn't make any sense whatsoever . It's also a scene that is explicit , nasty and mean spirited . Horny teenagers are a legitimate target in these type of films but not women and children What makes the film even harder to follow is the cinematography by Daniel C Pearl - everything is shoot so darkly it's often difficult to tell what is happening on screen and judging by the comments on this website and the external reviews it seems a massive amount of people have had a similar problem trying to work what was going on . I've never seen a big budget studio release with such poor lighting . Apparently this film cost $40 million . That's kind of expensive for something that could have easily have been produced for radio All in all REQUIEM is an example of Hollywood not realising that it's a good idea to quit while you're miles behind . The upside of all this is that the average cinema goers can convince themselves that the ALIEN franchise ended with ALIEN 3 whilst the PREDATOR was composed of a mere two films",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
12,Scarecrow-88,Aliens versus Predator:Requiem,5,26 April 2008,"Gunnison County, Colorado faces an incredible crisis of galactic proportions..A Predator-alien hybrid, Predalien, has birthed on a Predator ship studying other aliens, face-huggers kept in liquid glass cannisters,and causes the space vessel to crash-land in a forest region on Earth near the Colorado town posing a thread to humankind. We watch as the Predalien spreads eggs into the human populace while the face-huggers, which escapes the crashed Predator ship, attach to human faces. The birthing process, unlike in previous Alien films, is much faster it seems and they soon grow into the monsters that go on a murderous rampage leaving bodies piled up. Soon the National Guard moves in only to be eliminated in quick fashion, leaving a motley group of surviving citizens to fend for their very lives as menacing baddies are at every turn. A Predator warrior, who finds his fallen comrades, silently vows vengeance, and any human in this path will die.Glossy dumb cartoon action-horror flick is a fun way to waste 100 minutes. Characters are given just enough exposition to establish them before they face the trials of being in between a war of a Predator warrior and slimy alien walkers. Yes, a lot of the film takes place at night and within darkened places(such as a sewer during which alien face huggers attach themselves to derelicts' faces and Predalien attacks a female hobo who finds her buddies under unfortunate conditions, while we also see the Predator warrior setting up hi-tech booby-traps and blasting them before exploding through the city street above)so the action can be hard to place which is a shame. I didn't have a problem others, it seems, have with the CGI used in the film. CGI actually never occurred to me. The filmmakers found clever ways to use Predator warrior's night vision to display the violent wake of their victims' dead bodies. There was also an amusing scene where a citizen's head is taken clean off by the Predator warrior's helmet laser. And, the Predator warrior uses a large , hi-tech forms of daggers which, when thrown, slice off alien heads(..one even sticks a human to the wall). The Predalien is a funny hybrid which can actually lay eggs down the throats of victims(..as is the case when the things fills the body of a pregnant woman in a hospital). It has the face of a Predator, yet has the alien walker's whipping tail. As in any of the previous films that came before this, there are human casualties, in the wrong place at the wrong time, such as a father and his son hunting, nuclear power plant technicians who find themselves trapped at work while the Predator warrior does battle with an alien walker, a sensitive father whose killed right in front of his returned soldier wife and frightened daughter, etc. You have two brothers, with a troubled relationship, who must set aside their differences when terrors are threatening them. One's hottie girlfriend gets the goofy clichéd lines that have become standard dialogs for these kind of films, such as ""We're not gonna make it, are we?"" or ""Maybe, they're all gone."" You have the typical governmental corruption, as humans expect an airlift to rescue them with a plane under different orders. As you've probably read elsewhere, with a fine-tooth comb, you could pick this film clean because there are an endless foray of holes which pop out to snap you faster than an alien walker's second mouth..but, it goes by so fast that I barely had enough time to care. Certainly a guilty pleasure, but isn't a classic by any means of the imagination. If you can somehow turn your brain off(..yes, this is often used when one watches a film such as ""Aliens versus Predator"")this might be entertaining. If anything, you get little aliens bursting from the stomachs of women, acid melting away human faces, and a combat between a Predator using the gadgetry at his disposal against a growing number of nasty, slimy-mouthed aliens. What's not to love, eh?",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
13,Hey_Sweden,"""That's crazy! The government doesn't lie to people!""",6,31 March 2017,"Gleefully silly continuation of the events in ""Alien vs. Predator"" shows what happens as the truly monstrous ""PredAlien"" (veteran effects expert and creature performer Tom Woodruff Jr.) and numerous other Xenomorphs run amok in a remote Colorado town. While a great many of the local citizens are victimized, a select few come together and struggle to make it to safety. Meanwhile, a solitary Predator (Ian Whyte) comes to town to handle the infestation in its own way.This movie is basically to its predecessor what ""Aliens"" was to ""Alien"", as it concentrates first and foremost on action and pace. Most of the human characters are not worth your time, although it's wonderful to see '24' babe Reiko Aylesworth as an ass kicking Ripley type character, a soldier just returned from Iraq. A fair amount of the dialogue is pretty bad, as well. But there is entertainment value for some viewers, provided that they can just put their brains in neutral. There's tons of violence - granted, there's the expected use of modern digital gore. The most interesting aspect for some in the audience will be the take no prisoners approach utilized by screenwriter Shane Salerno and directors Colin & Greg Strause. They pretty much treat the scenario as open season on many of the characters - including children. This will either delight or disgust viewers. The unqualified highlight - or absolute low point, depending on ones' sensibilities - is the ultra creepy maternity ward sequence.This viewer's not ashamed to admit that he digs this entry a fair bit, although he can understand why people would be inclined to dislike it. Certainly, the major bone of contention for a lot of people is cinematographer Daniel Pearls' (the original ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"") very minimalist lighting.Six out of 10.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

15,poolandrews,Disappointing.,5,3 February 2008,"AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem starts directly where the previous film AVP Alien vs. Predator (2004) finished with a Predator/Alien hybrid bursting out of the dead Predator, the Alien causes havoc aboard the Predator spaceship & in a fight is badly damaged which causes it to crash on Earth in the woods just outside the Colorado town of Gunnison. The Alien escapes as does several Alien facehuggers which impregnate Buddy (Kurt Max Runte) & his young son Sam (Liam James) who were out hunting deer in the woods, now several Alien creatures are on the loose & start to either kill or impregnate the inhabitants of Gunnison. On the Predator's home planet they realise what is happening & one sets off for Earth to kill all the Aliens...Directed by Colin & Greg Strause as the 'Brothers Strause' AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem marked their directorial feature film debut after making several music videos & primarily being known for visual effects. The very fact that AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem was directed by two special effects guy's doesn't bode well & one has to say for the most part this is a pretty poor film. The script by Shane Salerno follows on directly from the previous film & takes for granted that anyone sitting down to watch it is going to have seen other films in the franchise & assumes they know all about the Alien & Predator monsters which obviously not everyone will have. I could definitely see AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem leaving quite a few people new to the Alien & Predator franchise behind. There are many scenes & character's which were either stolen or inspired from other Alien & Predator films from a cute little girl, a strong female & a whole team of Marines to a scene where the Aliens are picking the Marines off. One could say that AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem reduces everything to the lowest common denominator in order to appeal to a geekish teen audience, from the dumb clichéd American teenage character's to the clichéd local small-town Sheriff who is in above his head to a soldier who just happens to be able to drive military vehicles & fly helicopters. The plot doesn't always make prefects sense either, why was there only one Predator again? Why did it vapourise all evidence of the Aliens again? Oh, that's right it's never explained in the first place. The setting is also bland & generic, previously we have had such diverse & visually interesting locations as outer space, alien planets, the lush South American jungle as well as an ancient Aztec temple buried under the Antartic ice which at least showed some imagination but AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem is set in some bland town & woods which seems more fitting for a straight-to-TV Sci-Fi Channel original rather than this once great series. Having said that at least it moves along at a nice pace & there is lots of Alien & Predator action, it does sort of entertain on a dumb basic level.Directors the Brothers Strause are special effects guy's & there are plenty of special effects in this, in fact it's clear that the effects took priority over any sort of interesting or original story. The Aliens & Predator's look great & there are some impressive creature effects, most of them seem to be of the on set prosthetic variety rather than the CGI computer effect sort. Having said that the Alien/Predator hybrid looks rubbish, it looks like an Alien but is has the pincer type jaws of a Predator which is fine & looks OK but it also has the long Predator style dreadlocks which just look stupid! Proudly boasting an 'R' rating as opposed to a watered down 'PG' in the US (here in the UK it passed the notoriously strict BBFC with a lowly '15' rating) one has to say that while there is a fair amount of blood & gore there wasn't as much as I had expected. Someones arm is melted off, someones face is melted, two peoples heads are blown off, various people are seen with their stomachs ripped open, a pregnant woman's stomach bursts open to expose several Alien babies, there are shots of a totally skinned cop & Aliens burst out of peoples chests. The way this is shot is terrible, it's so dark it's almost unwatchable & becomes very frustrating. The fights & action scenes are so poorly lit, shot & edited it's extremely hard to follow whats going on at times which makes for very annoying viewing. While the first two Alien films were almost perfect examples of suspense, tension, excitement & horror this is just a loud jumbled up mess. The scene here in AVPR: Aliens vs Predator where the Marines are picked off by the Aliens resembles the same scene in James Cameron's Aliens (1986) where the Marines are killed off in the Aliens nest right down to other people hearing the massacre over two way radios but the two are literally poles apart in terms of tension, scares, atmosphere & how they are shot.I'm not sure what sort of budget this had but you can see that money spent on each subsequent Alien or Predator film is getting less & less, with average special effects, no name actors, bland locations & surprisingly cheap looking production values. The acting is pretty poor by all involved.AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem is nowhere near as good as it's predecessors, this is Aliens & Predator for the MTV generation & that saddens me a great deal. Having said that while I disliked it for what it is I also sort of liked it for what it is if that makes sense, it certainly moves along at a decent pace & there's plenty of mindless action as well as some half decent gore.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
16,dbborroughs,"The monsters are great, the humans less so. If we could cut out all the people this would be a great film",4,30 December 2007,"At the end of Alien vs Predator a predator on a ship in orbit around earth had a chest burster explode from inside it. As this film begins the little monster grows and causes the ship to crash back on earth. The alien and other face huggers get out and begin to change a small town in the woods. One of the predators, dying from the crash, sends word back to his home planet and ""help"" is on the way. As people go missing, monsters go on the prowl and begin to battle each other.Short, this film is only about 85 minutes, so there isn't much exposition. we know the drill. Aliens hunt people and make more aliens, predators hunt aliens. People try to fight back but are hopelessly over matched.And for the monsters that works. the aliens and the predators do what they have to kill people and each other in spectacular fashion. The monster stuff in the film is really good. The problem is that we are saddled with a bunch of cardboard humans who are as ""teen horror"" cliché as you can get. Lets face it despite the actors best efforts the humans aren't people they are cardboard cut outs. They give us so many characters and give us such a short amount of time (with some of them nothing more than monster fodder) there is no way for them to really be anything other than just cardboard targets. It kills the film. You don't care and you just want to see them die. I kept thinking get to the good stuff get to the monsters. If there is a way of chopping the film down to just the monsters that would be cool. Actually if they were going to treat the people as monster food why didn't they just tell the story from the predators point of view and it all would have been good stuff and we would have known why the people go the short end of the stick.I know people are going bananas because they film alters what we know about aliens and predators. I'm okay with some of the playing around. What bothers me is the time frame for alien birth. Its much too fluid in this film. Whats worse more often then not its much too fast. We need lots of aliens so we'll have them spawn faster. Never mind changing what we know its just too damn fast (the hospital sequence is particularly annoying) If you're interested wait for DVD or cable. The monster stuff is great and worth a look. the rest of it is considerably less so. And as for those who hated the first Alien Predator film- here's a reason to like the first one.

17,Bunuel1976,"AVPR: ALIENS VS. PREDATOR - REQUIEM {Unrated Version} (Colin and Greg Strause, 2007) *1/2",2,28 April 2008,"Yet another unnecessary entry in an initially intriguing franchise. No, make that two! I love the first ALIEN (1979), enjoyed the acclaimed first sequel and basically tolerated its subsequent official sequels; I liked PREDATOR (1987) when I watched it around the time of release and did not mind its follow-up. Their eventual match-up was as incongruous as that between Jason Vorhees and Freddy Kruger but, while that one has wisely been an idiosyncratic one-off (at least, so it appears thus far), the greedy suits in charge at the Hollywood studios nowadays have decided to take one more trip to the well in this case. More like flogging a dead horse, if you ask me.In fact, so clearly aware of the repetitive nature and – let’s face it – abject redundancy of this whole venture are the film-makers that they transpose the previously outer space-set challenge into our world yet again and (predictable as rain on a cloudy day) simply pile on the creatures. Therefore, in place of the scary chest-buster of Ridley Scott’s movie, we have three of four of the alien buggers bursting indiscriminately out of people every quarter of an hour or so. Likewise, we have two aliens up close and personal with a female character in the same sequence and also myriad face huggers. So, what else is new? I don’t recall ALIEN VS. PREDATOR (2004) well enough to remember the reason for the enmity between the two alien monster species but, at least, their previous encounter was set aboard a spaceship – and an aura of pseudo-STARGATE mysticism that went with it. In the sequel, however, we’re saddled with just stereotypical characters (read alien fodder): squabbling teenagers, incredulous police officers and resourceful army personnel. However, all the effort that evidently went into the make-up and special effects department goes to naught when everybody is just dying off like flies and, what’s worse, most of the action occurs in rain-swept streets and semi-darkness. At least, when the Terminator fought another machine, Arnie became the good guy and protected the targeted child!!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
18,Boba_Fett1138,Pointless and even insulting entry into the series.,3,9 October 2011,"All of these aliens versus predators movies are such a waste of potential. I mean here you have a movie with two of the most iconic and most awesome but also most threatening and scary aliens, out of movie history, how could you mess things up? Very easily as it turned out, since after ""AVP: Alien vs. Predator"" this movie is even a bigger disappointment and a serious waste of some fine potential.Things already stat to happen way before story lines get properly set up and 'important' characters get introduced and developed. The movie got directed by two brothers Colin Strause, Greg Strause and let me tell you, it also really feels as if it got shot by two persons. It feels like one brother did all of the human scene's, while the other was having as much fun as possible and going totally overboard with all of the alien sequences, involving the aliens and the predators.There is not ever any real sense of danger, since nothing gets build- or set up properly. Things just happen and both the aliens and predator kill all of the humans that cross their path at random. Here is a guy in the kitchen. Lets send an alien in to kill him. Or here are a bunch of kids in a swimming pool, time for them to die. There is really no logic behind anything and in fact it's kind off insulting for both the aliens and the predators to get used, or rather said wasted, in such a way by the film-makers. They must have thought that aliens and predators killing off each other and as many people as possible, on Earth, equals a great movie. And perhaps I should admit, on paper this also sounds awesome and like a fan-boy's dream but they have basically done absolutely nothing creative, original or interesting with its concept.And I say that there are lots of killings in this movie but I'm only guessing, since you can't see much of what is ever happening in this movie. It's so dark you really can't tell what is going on half of the time. Also the editing ensures that you often have no idea what is going on during all of the action sequences.I'm also still left quite puzzled as to who was supposed to be the main 'hero' of this movie. All of the human characters remains such incredibly shallow ones, who are left at the background of the story. I seriously also couldn't really tell who was who, since nobody gets developed properly and the movie is severely lacking in good or even likable enough characters. Why should you care for any of them or what happens to them.But also the aliens and the predators can't really impress. I just don't get it how they actually managed to make both the aliens and predators look bad and cheap in this movie. Out of all of the alien-series movies this has got to be the one with the worst and most cheap looking aliens in it. Even the special effects used for the predators, such as its heat vision, is something way worse looking than the effects used in the first 1987 movie ""Predator"". And to put things in perspective; ""Predator"", ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" combined cost about just as much as this movie did in total.A good Aliens vs. Predators movie should still be really possible and could potential even truly become something awesome but only with a more decent director involved (James Cameron or Ridley Scott would obviously be perfect) and a better written- and more original script, that can manage to bring the best out of both worlds together, without feeling the need to exploit it.I really can't think off one thing this movie impressed me with. I have ever seen cheap B-movies that are way better, more entertaining and more original than this movie ever remotely got.3/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"No personality, but looks good and there's lots of death",5,15 December 2010,"Based on the Unrated Extended Cut. This begins where the last one left off(I won't spoil it here). The vehicle crashes onto Earth, and the PredAlien begins taking over a small American town, with the aid of its non-hybrid mates. A lone Predator goes to clean up the mess(think Wolf from Pulp Fiction). The conflict between the two does come to a climax, and it is great. In fact, whenever we see the creatures, it's nice, it's what we want, and though we see a lot of the latter as it sets up traps and such, they remain powerful, effective and terrifying. One problem is that the humans in this get in the way. We don't care about them. They're stereotypical and the acting is maybe decent. The chick is clearly just there for us straight young males in the audience. We get a Ripley clone. There are subplots involving them, and they're OK, they and the dialog(and the ""comedy"" never works) simply feel phoned in, it's clear that they didn't really care about them. And ""they"" are the Strause's, who don't know how to helm a film other than the visual aspect(and they like to give their work pretentious names... *cough* Skyline *cough*). Because yes, this is shot and edited quite well. The lighting is expertly done, and this is a horror flick(as it should be, considering the titular beings... then again, there are action scenes in this(I will admit that the choreography is noteworthy, they certainly are cool), with a lot of darkness and shadow. Close-ups and quick cuts are often used to keep the extraterrestrials hidden. This doesn't really take time to build up an atmosphere, it goes for a fast pace instead. The settings aren't bad, and we for example get the wet, claustrophobic space of a sewer. This is essentially a soulless 91 minutes(sans credits), and only for those who want gratuitous, bloody, gory violence and death(and some creativity to it), because that there is plenty of, and it is obviously where the energy was spent. It could scare you, if you weren't so blasé about everyone on the screen other than the ones not from this planet. The DVD comes with two commentary tracks, one by the two ""director"" brothers(who sound positively disgusting and juvenile) and a producer, and the other by the dual designers of the Xenomorph etc.(they have a very dry sense of humor, and are funny if you like that) and trailers for other films. I recommend this to those seeking something like this, and are hoping it's graphic. 5/10",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
20,view_and_review,Round Two--Fight!,5,19 May 2016,"After AVP I was anxious to see a sequel, which is funny to say because I only heard about AVPR last week. You'd think if I was that anxious I'd have known about AVPR well before 2016.AVPR didn't have the same appeal as AVP (which is customary for most sequels). Once again Predators are fighting Aliens and Aliens are fighting Predators and the battleground is planet Earth. I wonder how many times they chose our planet to duke it out? Gunnison County, Colorado happened to be the unfortunate venue for these ugly extraterrestrials this time around. They went at it like Crips and Bloods with humans being the collateral damage.The acting in this movie as well as the script was substandard. There were so many bland and unlikable characters introduced that it became a guessing game of who would be canon fodder and who would survive. There were your regular gambit of scary movie cliché characters: the girl, the boy, the coward, the prick, the cronies, the kid, et al. I will say that they made an adventure out of guessing who would live and who would die. Most deaths were predictable, but the unpredictable ones were the best.Still, the story just wasn't as compelling and the extra carnage seemed gratuitous. Another problem I had (and this could've been my computer screen and/or the website) was most of the movie took place at night and I couldn't see who was who and what was what. Was the predator defeating the alien? Was the alien defeating the predator? Did one of them escape? I'd see flashes of action then green blood.Putting aside my viewing difficulties it was still an average movie and the ending was just abysmal.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

22,neil-476,Um.... OK....,6,4 December 2010,"Back in the 1930s/1940s, Universal Studios came up with a number of pretty good (for the time) monster/horror movies. Frankenstein and Bride Of Frankenstein, in particular, still stand up very well today. But Universal had the idea of milking their monster franchises as far as they could: their monsters got teamed up with each other, and the series eventually came to an end with Abbott and Costello meeting the assorted monsters (which wasn't as bad as it sounds, but you get the idea).Back in the 1980s/1990s, Twentieth Century Fox came up with a couple of pretty good monster/horror/sci-fi movies. Alien, Aliens and Predator, in particular, still stand up very well today. But TCF had the idea of milking their monster franchises as far as they could: their monsters got teamed up with each other and, while they haven't yet met Will Ferrell and Ben Stiller, AVPR is well on the way down that particular road.Not that there is that much wrong with AVPR as such, other than that: 1. It's in almost total darkness, so you can't see what's going on; 2. It is mixed up with the tedious goings-on of assorted townsfolk. This is intended to make you sympathise and identify with some of them, but you don't;3. The cast is all complete unknowns. This doesn't really matter other than it is clear that everyone is slaughter fodder (which may be what you are watching for, admittedly); 4. There is no discernible plot beyond the woefully obvious.Production values appear higher than they actually are.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
23,Uriah43,A Rather Tedious Sequel,3,18 March 2021,"This film begins where its predecessor left off with the body of the dead predator being taken aboard one of its vessels for transport back to its home world. What none of the occupants of this space ship realize is that an alien creature has burrowed itself inside the dead body and upon emerging it causes an immediate disruption resulting in the space craft veering out of control and crashing back onto the earth. Although all of the predators are killed upon impact, the alien creature survives and immediately sets out to propagate its species with the human population of a nearby small town. Alarmed that one of its space crafts has crashed another ""Predator"" (played by Ian Whyte) in a space ship orbiting nearby immediately lands and becomes determined to conceal any evidence of their presence. So after destroying the badly damaged space craft--and the body of the only dead predator nearby--it then goes off to destroy the alien creature and all of its progeny with absolutely no regard or compassion for the lives of any of the human beings it may encounter along the way. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I didn't honestly care for this particular film mainly because the directors (Colin Strause and Greg Strause) were more preoccupied with the action sequences than they were on a good plot or character development. As a result, one character after another was introduced only to be subsequently killed just minutes later. Likewise, I didn't particularly care for the manner in which the Predator was portrayed no differently than the alien creatures-a killing machine to anybody that got in its way. In short, those viewers who enjoy constant action without regard to anything else may be entertained by this film. I personally found it to be rather tedious and I have rated it accordingly.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

That would be the only creative process to this mindless bag of puke. In a nutshell aliens and predators land on earth. Predators try to kill the aliens that are making a feeding frenzy out a lot of talent free actors. It is pretty bad when there exits two successful franchises and the best the filmmakers can come up with is the lowest attack on common sense. Nobody who respects Alien or Aliens will likely find anything remotely worthwhile about this bag of puke. Directors Greg and Colin Strause have fun with special effects but that is the height of the effort here. The aliens and predators look great but perhaps had they hired a screenwriter that averages above third grade then perhaps viewers and fans could have been treated to a real extravaganza. Instead we are left with a by the numbers effort that treats its characters like fast food for these creatures. Actors include Steven Pasquale, John Oritz, Johnny Lewis, Kristen Hager, and a lot of other folks. They are all wasting valuable time.

I may be one of the few that liked this second(possibly last?!) AVP film, which picks up right where the previous film ended, with the Alien infested Predator ship crashing to Earth, unleashing Alien hordes on an unsuspecting and secluded Colorado town. A veteran Predator is then dispatched to Earth to clean up the mess, and cover up their involvement.I admit that the cast of unknowns may not grab you, but they are still reasonably interesting, and come off realistically, with elements that parallel earlier films in the series. Lots of good action, and plenty of scares, though I admit it is(literally) too dark at times, but then it is set at night in the rain!

Meanwhile, another Predator lands on the spot seeking out the Alien and destroys evidence of their presence on Earth. The townsfolk find themselves in the middle of a battle between the two creatures, and the small group of survivors splits between the leadership of Sheriff Morales and ne'er do well Dallas. But both have a different opinion about the best means to escape......So not many people were impressed by Andersons AvP, but, it was affable stuff, and tried so hard to keep it in synch with both franchises. But hey ho,mother dreaded PG13 certificate reared its ugly head, and didn't give us what we really wanted......an all out epic battle.So the Brothers Strause heard all the moaning about the lack of violence and blood, and have gone all out in this one, but in adding the all important gore factor, plot, character development, and coherence have gone out of the window.So the film just basically consists of two gangs hiding from the aliens, getting killed in disgusting ways, and fighting back. That's literally the film.For a film that branches two of the greatest science fiction franchises of all time together, it would take a huge effort to make it boring. Well The brothers have made that effort, and have given us one boring, in interesting motion picture.And the budget must have gone on the special effects, because it sure didn't go on lighting.

27,Aaron1375,Now that is how the Predator should be portrayed!!!,8,17 April 2008,"I enjoyed this film quite a bit. Though I see from the score here, it was not the opinion shared by the majority of people. However, the fact I liked it so much may have less to do with this movie itself, but rather the fact the last three horror movies I have watched have been so darn slow and really really bad in one instance. The story picks up right after the first movie, as there is an alien/predator hybrid and it causes a predator ship to crash land in a rural Colorado town. Before you know it, face huggers that the predators have on board are out finding people to attach themselves to. Meanwhile, a dying predator on board sends out a signal to the alien home world and here comes a predator to the rescue!!! Not really, he is quite the killer, as you can tell he is a seasoned veteran among predators, unlike the rookies we got in the first film. Which is partly why I liked this one more, in the first one I really wanted to see the predator kick some butt, here he does in a big way. I have also wanted to see an alien invasion on earth and I got that too, just not in the big way I have always imagined, basically an all out alien attack. Still, lots of blood and lots of predator super weapons and alien tail and mouth action to make me happy...well not all about it was perfect. It suffers from one to many story lines as far as the people in the movie, boy in love, guy returns to town, woman returns from military duty, a sheriff not quite sure what to do...made me enjoy the pizza guy whose story was simply a warm body to kill. Also, the fight at the end with the predator and the predalien could have lasted a tad longer. Also, there was the fact it was a bit hard to see what in the world was going on at times as well.

29,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem,5,31 December 2007,"My very first encounter with Aliens Versus Predator, was actually a coin operated arcade game some more than 10 years back. For 20c for 3-5 chances (depending on how the owner configured the machine), you can choose between a 2 Predator Warriors, or 2 humans, to go up against an Alien infested land, where you score points with multiple Alien kills, and get to use some of the cool weapons (always like those killer discs) and combo moves to finish off opponents. Needless to say, who would want to use the human characters, when you can play Predator?The PC game then emerged, this time sticking closer to the ""Versus"" format, where you can pick to play either character from a first person perspective, and have at your disposal the multitude of weapons and moves, making it truly a gaming experience, if not for my crappy PC of the time not being able to support the gameplay in full.These games actually game off the heels of the relatively successful movies, which are not works of art, but fairly decent action movies. In Predator, we have Arnold Schwarzeneggar and later Danny Glover in the sequel pitting their know how in rural and urban landscapes respectively, while in the Alien Quadrilogy, it made Sigourney Weaver arguably one of the first and most well known female action hero with her Ripley, under the masterful direction of Ridley Scott, James Cameron, David Fincher and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who also introduced Winona Ryder to the franchise.And with the successful creation of these cult characters, they found longevity in the games mentioned, as well as various books and graphic novels, challenging other established heroes to duels, until someone thought it would be a great idea to pit these two foreign creatures against each other in a movie, already having their respective fan bases to support it. Hence the first Aliens Versus Predator movie was born some three years ago, which for a strange reason, I did and have not yet watched.The sequel begins almost immediately where the first one left off, with an Alien ship having in its hold a dead Predator, who is suddenly found to be a carrier of the Alien larvae. Naturally this dude becomes the chief baddie with developing a hybrid Alien-Predator look, but sad to say, with none of their powers combined. Everyone on board gets pawned by the hybrid and the ship crash lands on Earth, thus beginning the second round. A new Predator watches the proceedings via Cable TV at his comfy sofa at home, and decides that he should preserve the honour and purity of his species, by going to Earth and killing off the bastard incarnation and its offspring, hence the hunter and the prey are set, whichever way you look at it.So the trailers seem to suggest the human involvement this time round, but seriously, they are caricatures that need to make up the death toll. While the respective franchise movies have a very strong human element in them, this one only has humans as fuel for gore. Which brings to mind that Transformers had a strong human aspect to it, which was panned by purists who want more of the robots. Here, we get a lot of Alien and Predator action, so let's not start by clamouring for more human soul and character development. Heck, this movie doesn't even need a storyline, but requires just an excuse to have the two species share the same screen and whack the living daylights out of each other, with humans as collateral to spill red blood, rather than gooey muck, or green plasma.It's basically one Predator pulling all the tricks in its book using weapons we're already so familiar with, it's like second nature guessing what this lone wolf will utilize next. The Aliens here pose little threat really, and look more like rehashing the mood it likes in cold, dark and dank sewers, before breaking out to the city and unleashing hell on earth. And in this movie, everyone is fair game because it's not Titanic as one character puts it, so women and children enjoy no sanctity. One complaint I have though of the blood bath, is that almost all the action take place at night, which of course makes it perfectly easy for the CG folks to cut corners if necessary, and marred by the many close-up shots that make you see nothing perfectly too.As mentioned, don't go about looking for any semblance of a plot, which involves very clumsily, a mom returning from a theatre of war, some adolescent hormonal flings, an ex jailbird, and a town sheriff. Naturally they have watched either The Mist or 30 Days of Night, and with the ambiguous and strange serial killings in town, decide to hole up in a supermarket (again!) to stock supplies before venturing to safety. I vote the Supermarket as Cinematic Refuge for the Year 2007.With the usual sarcastic take on the Government (not lying to its citizens, and the final army decision taken which looked like a cop out), Aliens Versus Predator: Requiem, which was supposed to be shown on Christmas day, is just another pop corn movie with two men in rubber suits ushering in 2008.

It took a completely different turn from the first AVP movie, it's not a bad idea that they took Alien and Predator and put them in the up class suburbs, but from the idea of the first one explaining their reasons for existing, this was just an average and predictable horror sequel. Not to mention a story that keeps introducing new characters every scene where I wasn't sure who to keep in mind on who was the main character and why, so I couldn't really keep up with the story.From what I've gathered, of course the Predator and the Alien are up in space having to deal with the stuff of typical sit com neighbors, they're just beating the lights out of each other and they decide to why not? Go ahead and take it out on some Earthlings. So they crash and Alien is taking over the suburbia utopia. But teenagers, including a troubled couple who look like Ken and Barbie, a female marine and her daughter, among others, are going to make sure to kick some space butt, that is if the predator doesn't get there first. Because he is ticked off at the Alien, I guess for starting the party without him, lol, just kidding, actually for killing some of his friends.AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem isn't the worst movie by any standards, it's still pretty cool with a lot of the visual effects and the fight sequences between Alien and Predator are so cool to watch. Like the first sequel of Alien vs. Predator, the cast is the thing that ruins the film and just seems like they were not well developed, I know it's horror, but the original Alien and Predator films had characters, that you cared about and wanted to win. But it was a semi-decent sequel that I would say is worth a look for some fun, especially for Ken and Barbie's sake.4/10",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
33,MovieAddict2016,Aliens vs. Predator vs. John Hughes.,3,11 April 2008,"Early reports of this film's production were fairly promising. FOX had apparently taken note of fans' hatred for Paul W.S. Anderson's first ""AvP"" movie, greenlighting a ""hardcore R"" sequel (in the words of one of the film's producers). They also hired a couple geeks to direct the film, which caused the collective fanbase to celebrate across the Internet.One thing they neglected to mention: the film's budget was less than half of the first film's. This is never a good sign for a sequel - it means the studio doesn't have very much faith and is playing it safe. A $30 - $40 million budget is less risky than upping the ante. ""AvP"" performed well, but not exceptionally well, and part of its success was due to the PG-13 rating; any R-rated film is going to have less of a chance of capturing the teen demographic, and let's face it: most of the fans (not all, but most) are teenagers.Then FOX dumped the film on Christmas Day, which - as anyone familiar with such tactics is well aware - happens to be ""spring cleaning"" for the studios. It's when they throw out all their garbage in the hopes of letting them die quietly in theaters and not having to risk paying more to open amidst the summer rush and potentially lose money. FOX also denied critics' viewings and kept promotion to an absolute minimum; I think I saw two TV spots and an ad on YouTube and that was about it. They mainly relied on Internet promotion, and probably no doubt encouraged the Brothers Strause to participate in conversations online with fans to help set up the illusion of a ""fan driven project."" The truth is the Strauses are quite inept and FOX took advantage of their naivety to rush out a sloppy, B-movie sequel that looks cheap and has some of the most unintentionally funny moments I've seen in recent memory.First of all, the cinematography: awful. Couldn't see anything. The Strauses denied this numerous times online, blaming faulty projectors, but that is obviously a lie, whether they are aware of it or not. The truth is, the film's creature effects are so low budget and poor that the dark lighting and incomprehensible editing (it's impossible to tell what's going on - it's like Michael Bay on crack) only really serves to help disguise this. I don't have anything wrong with this per se, but when it SEVERELY alters the effectiveness of your film - to the point where viewers don't have a clue what's happening - that's a big problem. Especially when your film's entire selling point is essentially getting to watch big scary monsters fight each other.The second blunder of this film is also a direct result of the low budget. The fake backgrounds looked about on par with what most film students can do nowadays with basic effects editing suites. I suppose they used a lot of green screens to save money (no on-location shoots), but it looks awful. I see the Strause Brothers have a background in visual F/X and helped work on ""300"" - that may very well explain this problem. This visual style may have worked very well for ""300"" - but ""AvP"" (especially this one) attempts to align itself with reality, so all the fake backgrounds just make it seem like you're watching a Hallmark Hall of Fame special.Speaking of Hallmark and made-for-TV movies -- the teen subplot here was like John Hughes if John Hughes hadn't known how to write good dialogue or hire talented actors. First of all, we have the typical ""high schoolers"" being portrayed by actors in their mid-to-late '20s. Fun stuff. They also can't act, which results in hilarious misreadings of dialogue and bad takes that any experienced director would have left on the cutting room floor. The dialogue itself sounds about as bad as it would look on paper - the film's first 15 minutes introduces a kid working at a pizza place (yes, it jumps from an opening involving Predators and Aliens and Predaliens aboard an intergalactic ship slaughtering each other one by one - to suddenly focusing on some kid in Hicksville, USA delivering pizzas to a girl he has a crush on). The dialogue in this scene alone was enough to make me laugh and it only gets worse from there. I don't mean to sound too harsh against the Strauses because honestly I don't think they really knew what they were doing - FOX took advantage of their willingness and cooperation, trying to market the film strictly to the fans. But still. Say what you will about Paul Anderson as a director, but he has an excellent visual style in terms of cinematography and especially set design. He's awful with every other aspect of film-making, but at least the first AvP had the set design going for it. AvP: Reqiuem's ultimate flaw is that it's not fun. I don't want to give the impression that I was expecting another ""Godfather"" here - I just wanted some simple entertainment - but it's borderline mediocre and the sort of thing you'd find on TV at 2 in the morning. It's just a genuine disappointment and I hope all the franchises involved - Alien, Predator, and the crossover - can recover in the future. I'd like to see an Alien 5 and Predator 3 without any references to this having ever been made.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

35,OllieSuave-007,The government doesn't lie to people?,1,7 May 2014,"Picking up where the events of ""Alien vs. Predator"" left off, a spacecraft crashes in the woods in Gunnison County, Colorado, and out emerges an Alien hosted inside the pilot Predator from the previous film. Hot on the Alien's trail is another Predator, who plans to eliminated it and destroy all evidence of its presence on Earth. Caught in the war are the residents of the county, including groups of teenagers and local officials, wondering how to escape the creatures.Aside from the usual Alien vs. Predator action and pretty sophisticated special effects, this film is basically a bomb. There is no story - it's a movie mostly about a bunch of young punks running around, attempting to escape the attacking creatures, reminding you of a campy teenage horror/slasher flick. The acting is horrendous, where you have no character development, no substance and no drama. I wonder if Directors Colin Strause and Greg Strause put any extra effort in making these actors appear believable. With an actress' line in the movie like ""But that's impossible, the government doesn't lie to people,"" it makes you wonder if the directors intended for this movie to be tacky, or if they think the audience is naive enough to believe that.It's the worst of the Alien/Predator movie series, without a doubt.Grade F",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
36,Buddy-51,undistinguished sci-fi action flick,3,14 December 2010,"Like its 2004 predecessor, 2007's ""Alien vs. Predator: Requiem"" aims to determine which of the iconic sci-fi creatures would come out on top in a mano-a-mano, winner-take-all battle – as if anybody cared.Before getting to the creatures themselves, it should be noted that a number of familiar faces from TV headline the cast. In a role much different from the endearingly clueless fireman he plays in ""Rescue Me,"" Steven Pasquale stars as a tough-guy law enforcement official whose small Colorado town is being overrun by a bunch of pesky, bloodthirsty critters from outer space, the townsfolk being pretty much just collateral damage in what is, clearly, a much more epic battle being waged around them. And Sam Tremmell from ""True Blood"" and Reiko Aylesworth from ""24"" also get some big-screen time to add to their resumes.Not that the human characters in this kind of story matter much anyway. And after decades of overexposure (remember how truly terrifying the first two ""Alien"" films were?), the bloom is clearly off the rose when it comes to both these creatures - and since neither ever speaks, it's not exactly a duel of wits that's going on between them. And, besides, the movie is shot so dark, it's virtually impossible to see what's taking place on screen anyway. That doesn't do much for the coherence of the storytelling, but what does it really matter when it's all just about guts, gore, gadgets and goop, after all?",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
37,thesar-2,They Lived,5,26 February 2013,"(Special Note: This is a delayed review from a movie I recently saw, albeit many months ago. Without notes, these are my recollections to the best of my ability. If you were to speak to me about this particular movie, I bet I could elaborate even more. Mercifully, for most of my review's general lengths, this is going to be short, sweet & to the pointCheers.)Still, I'm puzzled on the subtitle or need for it, but still, I had a fun time with Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem. It's wildly all over the place with multitudes of subplots, one after another, but at its core, at least they set the Alien creature in our time frame and in a populated place on Earth – which I've wanted for 6 movies. I don't care too much about Predator. In fact, after seeing those three movies and the first spin-off, Alien vs. Predator, I still don't yearn to see more of them. (I'd much rather watch the same and copied character, the Hirogens, in Star Trek: Voyager.) Anyhoo, this movie reminded me a ton of a Dean Koontz Movie and it's definitely not without its flaws, but it's a fun, leave-your-brain-at-the-door sci-fi adventure, albeit very dark. Too bad they left it wide open for another sequel which I didn't think would be madefive years later, it really seems unlikely.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

39,lost-in-limbo,Neutral ground anyone?,5,2 May 2008,"I remember being disappointed with 'Alien vs. Predator' when I saw at the cinema, and after that letdown I wasn't expecting much when I heard that it was getting a sequel. I skipped it when it hit the cinema, but one of my buddies caught it and told me it was far better than its predecessor. Really, could it be true? Well just say that after I finished watching it, I was left with rather mixed feelings and a worn out patch in my hair. I just couldn't put my finger on it. It's not like I went in expecting something of master class story-telling and film-making, but on the other side of the argument even on the big, dumb and supposedly fun popcorn action angle it didn't entirely grip me. Brainless it is, but disposable excitement. It has its moments. At least it wasn't as limp, tame and laughable as the previous AVP outing, but the story here really does pale in comparison to that one. When it's not focusing on the alien or predator action, we're given bland characters and their threadbare melodramas to soak up. Clichéd writing, inept dialogues and uninteresting personalities just get in the way and never set itself apart. There are some comic book-like fireworks, and a real unpleasant tone within. It has balls, but its action without intensity. Sure it has a feverish and rapid manner, but it doesn't mean it'll draw any sort of suspense. Instead it yields a real moodiness to it all. This is kind of weird, because it works.Lights. Camera. Action. Hey who turned off the lights? What was the deal? Talk about pitch black. Was it a device to hide the aliens, or to cover the blemishes of the special effects (which I didn't think the conceived CGI was not too badly done)? Rather then being frustrated, strangely enough it didn't bother me a hell of lot and had me curious. Even the story finds a way to purposely make it dark and hard to see. Why do it, and mainly around the action. There was one moment there was a character, which just seemed to disappear in the next shot. I was baffled. The murkiness of it didn't really add anything to the atmosphere, but gave it a chance to hide the horror and the uncertainty of what's lurking in it. Notice nothing seems clear and cut and the characters struggle to make any sense of it, even at the end. The slick and glossy chic distracts, and The Brothers Strause's shinny direction is rigorously pacey and plastered with some nice gimmicks (more so used by the Predator). They know there target audience. The dynamically familiar sounding score bombards from all sides. Performances fair-up for such a film like this with meek characterisations. It's not really about the actors here, but Steven Pasquale, Reiko Aylesworth, John Ortiz and Johnny Lewis are passable. Robert Joy makes a cameo appearance.Senselessly digestible, if not fulfilling.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
40,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Ultimately leaves you sad at how far away from Ridley Scott's late 70s masterpiece the franchise has become,2,19 January 2008,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Following on where the last film left off, the alien bugs take over the ship and force it to crashland in the woods of a small US town. When one of the local residents and his young son are reported missing, the residents begin to get worried and go on a search...little do they know they will soon be caught in the crossfire of a battle between the titular gruesome twosome that began in the frozen wastelands of Antarctica and will (hopefully!) end here.To be fair, I always felt the original 2004 film was a little under-rated and, in fairness, it did leave room open for a sequel, I suppose. This all feels very pointless anyway, boring as hell to boot, with the reliably cardboard characters and banal dialogue trotted out in rapid succession by the bucketload. Even the Predators seem to have gone bad, even though they ended up fighting for good at the end of the last film At no time does the film ever manage to be scary or suspenseful in any way, no matter how it thinks it is, and even the action, from the shoot-outs to the end one on one showdown between the gruesome twosome, fails to impress.Ultimately you're left on a depressed note when you feel how far away this film feels from the one that inspired all of this, Ridley Scott's classic 1979 film Alien, a masterclass in suspense and first class special effects that puts everything in this to shame. Even the last film's director, Paul Anderson, has gone, replaced by an unknown pair by the name of The Strause Brothers. There wasn't much praise heaped on that film, either, but anyone who thought that was really bad really ought to check this out. *",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
41,bowmanblue,So close (and yet so far),7,14 June 2014,"Believe it or not (and many fanboys don't), Aliens vs Predator was actually a financial success at the box office. Therefore a sequel was never going to be far behind. However, the studio was aware that the core Aliens/Predator fans felt short-changed from the first instalment, therefore the answer - apparently - was to make the sequel 'darker.' They succeeded. Aliens vs Predator 2 (or 'Requiem' for whatever reason) is indeed darker. In fact, sometimes it's so damn dark you can hardly see what's going on at all. Guess what... the fanboys still hated it.In fact, it got such a bad reception (both critically and commercially) that it managed to kill the franchise (not counting Prometheus). Therefore, you could be forgiven for thinking that watching Aliens vs Predator 2 is not that far away from having needles stuck in your eyes for an hour and a half. But that's going a little too far.It takes place only moments after the first film has ended. A half alien/half Predator has crash-landed on Earth, bringing with it a wave of death and destruction to a small American town. A 'cleaner' Predator is therefore despatched to sort it out so that the humans remain unaware of both races existence.It's not as bad as some people make out. Yes, it's no classic, but it is your average monster-munching movie. And perhaps that's the problem. And film with either the 'aliens' or the 'Predator' attached to it is expected to be a hell of a lot better than your average monster-munching movie. And, sadly, this one will never achieve such a high status as its seventies/eighties predecessors.It all seems a little like a teen slasher film. Instead of hardened soldiers (ala Predator), or Colonial Marines (ala Aliens), we have high school kids being stalked by the famous monsters. I can't put my finger on it, but it just doesn't really work.No, AVP2 is not as bad as the real haters say, it's just that it could have been so much better. Don't set your expectations too high and you might get a decent (if practically pitch black) hour and a half out of it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Plus there is hardly any light in the movie and it was hard to even see what was happening on screen. You really can't tell much detail as to what the aliens or predator is doing. One thing I could barely tell was this time around an alien has hatched from a predator's body, so we got half alien/predators running around a small Colorado town. I wonder why predator space ships just can't keep from crashing into earth. But other than that this is all logical.Any ways, why did only one predator go to earth to take on the aliens. Surely he would have rounded up some of his buddies. The humans which are just in the background are stereotypical of all monster movies.

46,The-Sarkologist,Unfairly Maligned,7,26 November 2018,"This film really gets a lot of flack that it doesn't actually deserve. Okay, maybe I have a slightly different view of films than the general population, though I have discovered that my feelings of a film generally sit well with the ratings that appear on IMDB, in most cases that is. Okay, I can sort of understand how people have reacted to some of the gore that appears in this film, and also the rather lame attempt at creating a Predalien, though I don't necessarily think that it was as bad as some people believe (though its ability to generate eggs as if it were a queen was something that sort of came out of the blue).Look, sure, there are a few scenes in this film that do break the cardinal rules of story telling, such as never killing kids, or suddenly killing off a character with no tension or lead up whatsoever, but that didn't actually undermine my enjoyment of the film. Sure, one could argue that there is either the shock factor, or pushing the boundaries, though I still find the onscreen killing of kids to be going just that little bit too far. As for the sudden death due to friendly fire, well, that goes beyond lazy story telling. Sure, in movies like this, we expect that pretty much a majority of the characters are going to die, but the thing is there are ways to kill of a character in a cinematic way, and the more important the character is, the more cinematic the death should be. Unfortunately, at one point in this film they did drop the ball somewhat.So, the film is pretty much set straight after the first in this series, and we have a predator that has been infested with an alien. Well, the alien escapes, causes damage to the ship, escapes in an escape pod and returns to Earth where it crashes in the Colorado wilderness. Also, the pod contains a number of face huggers, so you can be assured that this scenario is going to be set up with lots and lots of Aliens running around this small American town. Actually, this is a scenario that had yet to be explored, so I guess this is one of the reasons that I actually quite liked the film. However, before one of the predators was killed, it managed to send off a distress signal, so another predator travels to Earth to basically clean up the mess - thus we have what one could consider a true Alien vs Predator film.Yeah, now that I think about it, that previous film really did let me down a bit, namely because of the whole idea that the predators created the Aliens to hunt, and us humans were really only fodder to fuel their hunting desires. While the pyramid under the ice was pretty cool, simply turning us into just another game reserve for a bunch of hunters really didn't do it for me to the same extent.However, this film was much better in that regards, particularly with not only having an Alien infestation reach Earth, but also having a Predator, and a particularly will trained one at that, coming in to attempt to clean it all up. Where as the first movie pretty much had a bulk of the predators being taken out by the aliens fairly quickly, it was much better watching a seasoned hunter deal with them with no problem whatsoever. I guess that is another reason why they had to create the Predalien, even if it is only to give this particular guy a challenge. Still, with the speed at which the Alien's propogate he certainly wasn't in the position to clean the area up completely, which is why they had to end it the way they did.Still, it is pretty clear that the only way to bring this film to a close was they way that they brought it to a close. Maybe it seemed to be one of those situations that pretty much everything was lost so they pretty much pressed the reset button. However, considering that there were a lot of scenes which were reminiscent of the earlier films, when we consider Aliens, then the ending here was rather appropriate.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Too much to suspend our disbelief for. The security space of the US is entirely open and a first extraterrestrial vessel can crash in some forest without raising any concern. A second vessel from the same cosmic origin can crash again without even raising an alarm. Impossible, except if we accept the very last sentence as being prophetic. ""Ms. Yutani: The world isn't ready for this technology. Col. Stevens: But this isn't for our world, is it, Ms. Yutani?"" Is this predator-weapon the technology that could pacify the world by killing the aliens that menace it, or is a good old nuclear bomb more effective? Some human leaders will prefer destroying their own kind provided they themselves can survive and keep the power they have even if it becomes a power over graves and tombstones, as long as they themselves are not the collateral victims. I think it could have been more effective with this punch line: ""But this isn't FROM our world, is it, Ms Yutani?"" I even think a Ms Hu, or a Ms Hussein would have been a lot more pungent.

51,johnnyboyz,"""When two tribes go to war, a point is all that you can score."" Well, five points out of ten actually.",5,19 January 2008,"After a bit of further reading and exploration, I decided to look up what 'Requiem' actually meant. I knew it was Latin but what I didn't know is that in English, it means 'Rest'. There was also some information on a religious ceremony but to me, the word 'rest' suggests calm; it suggests 'peaceful' and to a certain sad degree that is exactly what AVPR is: a disappointing and rather silly film revolving around the two greatest extra terrestrial characters ever put to film. If anything, to call a film Alien vs. Predator: Rest is a bit careless but I suppose Requiem sounds 'cool'. I saw this on opening night in a packed cinema full of males aged from 18-25 odd and I don't think the general consensus was too positive. Coming from someone who has seen all of the previous Alien and Predator films as well as the first AVP; it seems that this little franchise is embedding itself firmly into a money making hole, hiding and waiting every few years to perhaps pop out and make a few more million on the side  the same thing happened to the Halloween series throughout the 80s where although the sequels felt bigger and better, they were really making more room for error. This series of course culminated last year with an actual remake of the original Carpenter 1978 film; so where did it go in the end? In one massive circle, that's where.You get the feeling these films are now going in a circle. The first thirty to forty minutes of AVPR is nothing you haven't already seen, so it's silly and anticlimactic. When the face-huggers are crawling around the woodland and the child and father are puzzled, we feel nothing as we know what will happen; when the camera tracks in on the boy after he's had the hugger fall off, he starts coughing but guess what? Yes, we know what will happen. The first Alien was a film that drowned in suspense; here there is none of it as we have that prior knowledge. Another example is the unveiling of the Predator  one of the most cinematic moments of any film from the 1980s but not now, in 2008. But knowing what's what and the characters not knowing is a theme the film carries. In the film, we play God  we know exactly what is around each corner and exactly what they're up against. The poor townsfolk are clueless and frightened as we watch on in a rather sadistic and voyeuristic manner, going through the motions as their fates await them. Some scenes here involve the two going down into the sewers to get some keys, the people looking in the woods and the people awaiting rescue in the town's centre.This is one of the reasons I liked the first film more than this one. Here, it isn't a game; it's a formula that has been done before. The first film had more of a horror element as these people were fighting for their lives in a maze but they were really just pawns in a massive game of chess between two powerful pieces. AVPR is disappointing in the sense that there is only one Predator who is sent in to clear up a botched delivery job and erase all the evidence; a sort of mercenary figure who goes from task to task. Firstly, this is a disappointing idea and I would've much preferred several more Predators to have joined this lone warrior; secondly, the Predator seems so skilled that he is just doing it all for fun. The fight sequences are rather quick initially and only when they get a little longer do they just seem too dark. There isn't enough shot choice here so the film will pretty much shoot its action sequences in medium close up fashion. If we think of some recent large scale fight scenes in other films, we might think of King Kong or Kill Bill vol. 1 where shot range was evident on a bigger and better scale thus making the scenes more enjoyable.AVPR also submits to nasty representation. I'm not spoiling anything too big here but the black character's involvement is what you would assume it to be in terms of 'who dies first' and the representation of the women is horrible. There is a shot of the girl's behind filling the screen as she hurriedly squirms her clothes back on; also, when the girl is first shown to the audience, we have a medium close up of the guy looking; cut to POINT OF VIEW as he watches her walk across her lawn and bend over her car before cutting back to get his nod of appreciation reaction in medium shot again. AVPR tries to bail itself out of its own predicament by including a Ripley type figure that has short, brown hair and dresses properly instead of in bikinis and short shorts. Notice how they move, talk and act compared to one another. But it would be silly to look deeply for flaws and frustrations if on the surface the film doesn't get it right there. The film plays out into a routine 'who will get picked off next' routine where I'm sure you'll have fun trying to guess who does die next. The film lacks genuine thrills, its suspense is incidental since we know what to expect and the element of humour that opens up towards the end feels forced and out of place. A quick reference to 'stoners' and how trustworthy the government must have made the producers think it was enough to wedge it into the comedy genre. There is a disturbing inclusion of pregnant women towards the end, a forced plot point involving a top government official and the finale as the final act happens is complete with a one-liner that is just embarrassing. Not a good addition to the 'franchise'.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
52,Rectangular_businessman,Even worse than the movie of Paul W. S. Anderson,1,14 June 2010,"I don't remember a lot about the first movie, other than it being mostly trash, managing to screw with the established continuity for both franchises it involves, and ending with an alien fetus inside a predator. Oh my! That's pretty much where the sequel picks up - a hybrid between the two emerges, messes up the ship kills the other predators, and lands (in a very crashing sort of way) on Earth, where it and some face huggers (Which I guess were on the ship because the predators were studying them? I don't care enough to remember or look it up) proceed to wreak havoc on a small town in the United States. I won't say AVPR is anything close to a good movie, but I did enjoy it more than the first, which seems to be an uncommon sentiment. It's sort of the typical slasher set-up, unlike what we've really seen in either series previously, as it establishes a handful of interconnected and not terribly interesting characters, and then picks them off gradually in increasingly gruesome ways. Not usually my cup of tea, but it's a formula that I guess works and doesn't seem that out of place with the idea of putting either of these sci-fi killers in that setting.Of course... those killers shouldn't be in that setting in the first place. The predator in the movie is a bad-ass cleaner who comes in to cover up the chaos caused by the incident in the beginning. He doesn't do a very good job of it, as before long the entire town is overrun with aliens and the government has to call in the big guns. But why do they care about the cover up in the first place? They're hunters, not galactic police men. It just leads to another annoying predator who kills everyone he comes across, which is less compelling than the original characterization. Sorry to spoil this crappy movie that you don't care about the plot of, but there's a tie-in at the end to the Weyland-Yutani corporation of the Alien movies, supposing that predator technology helped humans eventually get out into space in a serious way in the first place. Um, okay... so why do they still use flamethrowers and bullets in the future if they have a predator's energy-whatever gun, and how come the company claims to have no recorded cases of the aliens previously in the future? The entire point of the Nostromo's diversion was to get a living sample of one of the creatures, but we're supposed to think it took them that long to get one when there was an outbreak of them ON EARTH during our time? They should have just made their movie with adequately gory deaths and fan-pleasing homages instead of trying to get cute and tying it all together. Also, the Predalien looks too much like the predator. Aliens from humans don't look nearly that human",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Unlike the Aliens, the Predalien places his eggs in certain victims, like for instance; pregnant women! The Predator would not even attack a pregnant woman. The real heroes in this movie is a Army soldier, an angry teenager and a few others who help stop the infestation of the town. But the government is more sinister than the creatures themselves. The sheriff should have been more cooperative, however he had some bright spots when the attack came out. We don't know who won the battle, but we'll never know the victor of the invasion. The town and the creatures weren't the only casualties, the Aliens will be to true losers of the hunt. If you side with the Predator in that battle, you'll be marked as an ally.

57,FiendishDramaturgy,What a Nice Surprise!,8,28 December 2007,"I saw it was set in Colorado, and I had my doubts. I saw it featured a cast I had never heard of and I had further doubts. I read a few of the story ideas, and I almost passed on this one.I'm glad I didn't.First off, this was rated ""R"" rather than the watered-down whiny version of AvP which was served to us like a steaming pile of feces, in the theaters a couple of years ago.This installment of the combo-franchise is true to both the Alien AND the Predator franchises, as well as the AvP line, itself. I was quite impressed with the beauty of the continuity, the auspicious design of the Predalien, and the incredible attention paid to detail. Look for a return of the weapon removed from the sarcophagus in AvP, some of the toys and gadgets aboard the Predator ship you may remember from Predator 2, and the deep forest setting in the beginning is quite reminiscent of the setting of Predator.The acting was the only area, which needed some help, in my opinion. The dialog delivery was poor, although the dialog itself was quite well written. However, the slick production design, the great story, and excellent execution do serve as qualified distraction from the aforementioned fault, thereby rendering this film worthy, in the extreme.All in all? This is a most excellent Friday/Saturday night movie! But NOT one for the kiddies. This is a fitting and deserved installment in the AvP franchise; one which tops the original by leaps and bounds. This actually rates up there with A2 and P1! It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

59,ebiros2,Alien fights Predator in the dark,5,22 June 2008,"The fascination of this movie is what happens when two of the worst space beasts land on the earth's unsuspecting suburb ?The plot from there is what you might expect, one tries to kill the other while innocent and unsuspecting earthlings crosses path with them. The part that I did had problems was I couldn't figure out why Predator's craft had to separate from the mother ship and come to earth, and why was the ship's main lab located in this small craft where they kept all of Alien's embryos.What happened to all the other Predators in that gigantic ship ? Another thing that made this story difficult to understand is that every scene is shot so dark. So dark that half of the time I couldn't tell what was happening while the battle and killing was going on. Why did only one Predator come to earth, and what was his game plan ? The story could have been more entertaining if visuals and plots were little better fleshed out. Special effects were pretty good as I guess they've already been worked out on many prequels to this movie. So the story could have been better by having more predators, and cinematography could have better with better lit scenes.

60,dfranzen70,"Final reel saves clichéd, predictable script and direction",6,29 December 2007,"The five of you who have read past the title and are here, in the body of the review, I have this to tell you - it ain't that bad. Sure, this is the sixth or fourth in a rapidly declining series, and as the Law of Sequels tells us, the farther away from the first movie we get, the quality of each film decreases exponentially. Or proportionally. But I don't want to get all mathy on you.The film before this showed the long-awaited pairing of the Aliens and the Predator, and for the most part the result was pretty compelling. This time around, in a scene reminiscent of the original Alien movie, an interloping alien emerges from the prone body of a Predator and attacks the crew, causing their spaceship to plummet to a little blue-green planet. Before you know it, alien face-huggers are implanting themselves into a hunter and his son and then birthing chest-bursters near a small, unsuspecting Colorado town.Meanwhile - and really germane to the plot - the Predators have sent another of their kind down to Earth to destroy any evidence of their crashed (and dead, apparently) and to eradicate the Aliens. Which is a pretty fair fight, since the Predator has a lot of big guns and can turn invisible, and the Aliens can spit acid and slap you about the face and head. Of course, humans get caught in the crossfire, as they did in the movie's immediate predecessor.There are a lot of standard structures in this movie, such as the virginal (ahem) high school queen; the bad boy; the bad boy's older brother, who's an ex-con, and so on. People routinely wander into unlit areas for no reason other than to get slaughtered, and it's pretty clear from the git-go that the humans in this story are there merely to give us something to care about.Because let's face it. The Predator is in his watery-invisible form for most of the movie, and the Aliens are dark, and they all fight in dark, dark areas. With no humans, no recognizable faces, we might as well be watching polar bears in a snowstorm. Not only that, but - as with the last film - the audience can get someone for whom to root, in this case, the ineffectual, victimized humans who fire what amount to BB guns at a Sherman tank. Remember the tagline from the last movie? ""Whoever wins, we lose?"" For the first couple thirds of the movie, the humans act stupid and/or dully, acting as mere befuddled targets than people you'd care about. Except, of course, for the people who would somehow make it to the final third of the movie. Don't worry, they're easy to pick out; everyone else is easy to pick off.And certainly, it wouldn't be a sci-fi movie without some kind of potential government cover-up/conspiracy/meddling; thankfully, that thread isn't introduced until well into the movie, which means we don't spend half the film with the specter of the Evil Government That's Out to Destroy Everyone. Good thing, because more enemies just complicates things.Bottom line is that the final twenty minutes or so definitely make up for the lousy pacing and the lack of tension in the first hour. I mean, things were so bad that you could easily predict what would happen to a character you just met. Death scenes were telegraphed with a giant beacon that said ""PERSON DIES HERE. BLOOD SPURTS."" And make no mistake, this is a grisly movie that delights in people getting slaughtered in fun and exciting ways, involving evisceration. Or getting poked in the eye or chest. Or flaying. And no groups are spared - not women, not children, and not even pregnant women. It's a real windfall for aficionados of equal-opportunity gore.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Or Predator vs. King Kong? King Kong would have squashed Alien.If anyone watches this movie with an open mind (that is, without any bias, if that's possible), you will have to admit, albeit begrudgingly, that this is actually a good movie. As much as you may want to rag it, make fun of it, deride it, put it down, quash it, squash it, malign it, denigrate it, or belittle it, as tempting as it might be, you will not be able to honestly do so. This is a quality sci-fi movie. Accept it.When I went to watch this movie I was expecting just another Hollywood piece of potboiler junk, but I was surprised. This movie is actually good and as much as I would like to rag it, I can't because the movie gives no cause to do so. This movie is an action-packed science-fiction thriller in which the humans are completely superfluous except when they get in the way of the humanoids who have made earth their battlefield, and there's nothing the humans can do about it. NOTHING! This may be the first sci-fi movie in which the humans are completely helpless and rendered incapable of fighting back. In other words it's an original story, and it's the humanoids who are the stars.This is an incredible movie. Earthlings, when the Alien and Predator arrive, you're in the way! While these incredible non-human beings are going at it, the earthlings are utterly hapless and helpless. This movie is the surprise of the year. It out-Mists the Mist and it's even more compelling than the original Predator, which is one of the great sci-fi movies of all time. This movie is an example of Hollywood getting it right, where special effects do not trump the story, which this movie actually has. The question posed by this movie is: How do you get rid of unwanted humanoids from who-knows-where that have infested your town? Although not human, they are not animals nor mindless monsters. They are very human-like, especially when it comes to aggressive behavior. They are utterly fearless, act without remorse, are completely ferocious, extremely cunning, and in the case of Predator, armed with an array of weapons, including laser and nuclear, designed to destroy anything in the universe. They are not to be trifled with and in this movie they are not. Although Alien is intriguing, it is Predator who is most interesting. This is not a goofy movie. This is incredible sci-fi story with great acting and excellent special effects. Remember, although monstrous in appearance, Alien and Predator have certain human-like characteristics which make them far more complex than your typical Hollywood scary-monster. One thing is for certain: they have absolutely no use for humans except as an occasional meal. Otherwise, don't get in their way because they're unstoppable. And for goodness, sake, don't try to break up an Alien-Predator fight. That would be a huge mistake.In previous movies, humans initially are over-matched but still recover enough to at least put up a fight. What makes this movie different is that in this movie the humans are absolutely no match for the Aliens and Predator who are vastly superior in terms of weaponry, cunning, stealth and sheer power. They can be injured, they can be killed, but at a price that would mean the eventual defeat for humans in an all-out war. Regarding the Aliens, at first one might consider them to be merely highly vicious and uncontrollable monsters without any intellect, kind of like the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park and other similar Hollywood pulp, but that is not the case. They are highly intelligent, capable of planning actions and acting in concert to achieve for them the ultimate goal - to reproduce and at the same time destroy everything around them. Okay, Godzilla wanted to reproduce too, but unlike Aliens, Godzilla's intelligence was inversely proportional to her (or rather its) size ... and if you don't know what the term ""inversely proportional"" means, then that's your problem. Predator would have disposed of Godzilla in five seconds.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
62,dee.reid,"This time, it's war - ""Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem""",10,25 December 2007,"At last. Now this is what an ""AVP"" film should be: ""Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem"" has it all - action, special effects, violence, gore, and two races of alien beasts dueling for supremacy. It's an intense action experience from start to finish!Many were disappointed by ""AVP: Alien vs. Predator"" back in 2004, with its lack of gore and moments that seemed out-of-place for the first ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" crossover flick. In the three years since then, much of the blame and hatred for that film has fallen onto the shoulders of director Paul W.S. Anderson. While I believe Anderson is a competent filmmaker (he knew how to pace the film correctly and he made it look extremely good visually), I believe that he is too often (and too easily) manipulated by studio executives who like to take advantage of his naivety and ignorance of American film productions.Anderson is gone for now; replacing him this time out, are the Brothers Strause, Colin and Greg. The script for ""Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem"" was written by Shane Salerno, and it is much smarter and more skillful than that of ""AVP: Alien vs. Predator."" The Brothers Strause litter their film with enough action and terror and references to both ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" films past that fan-boys and geeks alike will have fun pointing them out (""Oh, man, that's the musical cue from 'Predator!'"" or, ""That guy has the same name as the captain from 'Alien!'"" or, ""That's the same Xenomorph design Stan Winston used in 'Aliens'!""). See what I mean?The Brothers Strause are careful to not make the same mistakes Anderson made in his film. From the first 10 minutes of this picture, it manages to really grip you and not let you go. Instead of a frozen pyramid somewhere in the depths of Antarctica, the action has been moved to a small town in Colorado, Middle America. Picking up directly from where Anderson's film never left off, a Predator ship carrying a lethal cargo of alien facehuggers crash-lands in the woods outside this small Colorado town. Said cargo soon gets loose and finds its prey in a hapless hunter and his 8-year-old son. Before you know it, alien Xenomorphs breed and later spread like a plague throughout the town, massacring every living thing they come upon.Although a small band of survivors comes together to fend off the infestation, surviving and getting out of the town alive is the only thing that matters, but, we soon learn that the Xenomorphs aren't the only extraterrestrials in town with a few days to kill. Their sworn nemeses, the extraterrestrial hunter Predators, have also returned, to ""clean up the mess"" and exterminate their foes. And who better than we poor, helpless humans to get caught up in the cross-fire of a full-scale extraterrestrial war?As stated before, this is a nifty piece of testosterone-driven film-making from two spirited directors who know their material and know it well. They take their cues to create fast & furious action sequences, one right after the other. From the opening 10 minutes of their feature, they really capture a hold of the viewer in an endless barrage of action, special effects and ever-mounting tension, despite a remarkably short running time. I really liked the small-town Colorado setting for the battle to take place. Here, most of the action is set out in the open but under a cover of rain and darkness, unlike in ""AVP: Alien vs. Predator""; no tunnels and claustrophobia here. And I also like the fact that the heroes of the film are everyday small-town people, rather than gung-ho military-type folks, convicts, or cops.There are a number of moments early in ""Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem"" that somewhat resemble any quirky small-town drama you can think of (like the guy who just got off a stint in the slammer for breaking & entering and reunites with his buddy who has since gone straight, or the guy who has a crush on a pretty popular girl, or the Army mom returning home to her family from a tour of duty in some far-off foreign land), as the main characters are introduced and we get to somewhat care for them when they're being slaughtered left and right by aliens and predators alike. In short, they're fairly interesting characters, even though they don't really go beyond being ""interesting."" Let's face it, we're here for aliens and predators, not puny humans. And thankfully there aren't too many moments in the movie when someone wanders off from the group and goes down a dark corridor or any other stupid horror movie moments. There are also a number of violent and taboo deaths (you'll know them when you see them) on all sides on display here, that I'm surprised haven't caught someone's furor. In summation, those who didn't get their licks in 2004 will surely be getting them this time in ""Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem."" The Brothers Strause have done the impossible task of not only making a superior sequel, but have made a film that is actually worthy of a place alongside the other films that inspired it.10/10",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

The dead Predator in the ship has Alien/Predator hybrid burst out of his stomach. He proceeds to cause the ship to crash, unleashing a few dozen more facehuggers on unsuspecting townsfolk.Well, the Predators, who apparently didn't have a good containment system for all the aliens they kept on their ship immediately know where their ship has crashed, and have sent one alien to go down and contain the situation.of course, in a plot twist that makes little or no sense, he eliminates the evidence of the ALiens, but takes the time to skin alive a hapless sheriff's deputy who happens to catch him doing it.Meanwhile, there is this idiotic subplot with the local pizza kid and the football bullies. Once again, Hollywood casts 20-somethings to play high-school kids. Most of the characters in this film are just introduced to be monster meat.

65,MaxBorg89,"More of the same, only worse",5,19 September 2010,"Save for one genuinely entertaining central sequence, the first Alien vs. Predator was absolutely unworthy of either franchise, despite Lance Henriksen's fan-friendly (though substantially gratuitous) presence. The Strause brothers, taking over from Paul WS Anderson, take it one step further with Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem, a sequel that marks an all-time low for both sagas. Ironically fitting, given the title.Picking up where the previous installment left off, the battle between the two lethal species evolves in the most sinister way: a Predalien (Predator/Alien hybrid) crash-lands on Earth, along with a group of facehuggers that are ready to attack all humans in the vicinity. As a small American town fights for its survival, the Predators decide to take matters into their own hands, sending a soldier to our planet to take out the new adversary.Like all sequels, AVPR sets out to be bigger and better, which means a new location (no more Antarctic pyramid), more Aliens (but only one Predator) and, consequently, more fighting, all rendered in all its gory glory after the PG-13 kiss of death that plagued the first movie. Unfortunately, that isn't quite enough: sure, the interspecies ass-kicking is well executed, but the choice to set everything during the night means that we only get glimpses of the two beasts (three if you count the Predalien) instead of the full-on massacre promised in the opening minutes.Characterization is another problem: with the exception of another mythology-related cameo (and this time it's a character we've never seen before, so who cares?), everyone involved is expendable and forgettable, a shame since the film features some truly impressive set-pieces, notably an Alien bursting out of a child's chest. But that's just one good moment in a film that ultimately stains the legacy of two of cinema's greatest monsters.

They are fighting themselves and killing humans just for fun.The plot of the movie is quite similar to the previous one but this time aliens and predators decided to fight in a small city of US. The movie is very poorly written and badly executed with a bonus of bad acting and baseless screenplay.The city has been caught up between the fight between aliens and predators and as a common sense all of the surviving people should stick together but no Kelly played by Reiko Aylesworth has her own plans because she had served in the US Army so she thinks she can save the mankind on her own, so they decided to go to the hospital to use the Helicopter kept in hospital to fly off the city to survive, now here comes the intelligence of director and screenplay writer. They are searching for helicopter which certainly be kept in an open space and since they all belong to that city so they must be aware of the location where the helicopter is kept, but they will go inside the hospital searching each and every room as if the helicopter is either hidden in any room or inside any cupboard. They somehow reaches to the helicopter and just they are about to flight, the army executes a nuclear strike and guess what everyone dies barring the few who were in helicopter as if they are immortals. There are lots of foolish and baseless scenes like this throughout the movie.Screenplay of the movie is pathetic and the movie is been shot in such a dark atmosphere that in most part of the movie it's very difficult to understand what's happening.

The 1st film is also very Good, This movie has that old school B movie Horror feel to it like it should've been made in the 80s & that's a very good thing, i love that the predators & Aliens end up in a little town with lots of woodlands around, this setting is so cool like the wooded areas in something like the Friday the 13th films IT'S so cool & i like the use of ordinary people characters & all the fantastic rain drenched 3rd act it's so exciting & creepy. The big half predator half Alien mutant is an AWESOME looking creature & so B-movie in tone IT'S great so yeah this is just a really well made fun creature feature really & it looks fantastic & has plenty of cool Action & some cool gore!!! A great sci-fi Horror that is just fun",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
68,davispittman,Nowhere near measuring up to the first,1,7 February 2016,"The first alien vs predator film was soooo much better than this garbage. AVP: Requiem is just a jumbled mess of CGI. It's not entertaining or well made at all. The dialogue is bad, and poorly written in every way. It is overrun with clichés, and I do mean overrun. The actors were alright, they actually weren't awful, but they certainly weren't great or impressionable. I truly don't even know what purpose this film has in the world. The first AVP was great! But this one is just so unbelievably convoluted and nonsensical. The action sequences are BORING and really void of any thrill or excitement. Also, there is a miscarriage in this movie due to an alien, and I did NOT like that at all, that was unnecessary and gross. Also, a 8/9 year old boy is killed by an alien as well, and I didn't like at all either, leave the kids of it for gods sake! This movie is a bore, it's not fun or exciting, it's just poorly made, and it's completely unnecessary, the first film was awesome, and it stood on its own well!

70,TOMNEL,Many special effects strung together with a non-existent plot. (Mild Spoilers),1,25 December 2007,"Marvel at the amazing special effects and huge budget. Gaze at the beautiful computer animated sets and cool looking creatures, because this is all you'll have to keep your sanity during this terrible movie. It seemed impossible to get any worse than the first Alien vs. Predator, but obviously the writers and director found a way. Other than the CGI and cool alien animatronics and predator costumes, this movie has nothing. It's a plot less mess relying on every cliché imaginable.The plot...well it's alien vs. predator. Aliens and predators fight each other and kill humans for fun along the way. Meanwhile, we are introduced to many unlikable characters, most of whom will be killed off, which is a positive. Every character is a cliché, none showing any emotion other than the basic ones showing their characters and explaining what their point to the ""story"" is. The writing is some of the worst I've ever experienced. Most of the dialogue was cringe-worthy, which leads to two positives in the film. Half of the movie is aliens fighting predators and the runtime is only 85 minutes. So, in the end, what we have here is an extremely stupid movie, with a dumb political message. And, even worse, we're set up for a sequel !?! Please, don't kill the Alien and Predator franchise anymore!!!!My rating: BOMB/****. 89 mins.

Unfortunately for us it crashes on Earth, and its hunt starts directly. Also a Predator is dispatched to hunt down this abomination. In the middle of it, the humans and inhabitants of a small town in northern USA.Comments: Surely no one can be surprised when watching this? Both the Alien and Predator franchises is well established now, as well on movie before this in the Alien vs Predator series. And this brings no surprises. To summarize it in three short words it could be described as Dark, Bloody and Jerky.Actually this is maybe even more full of blood and gore than movies in the franchises before it. No one is safe from the bloodlust of the fast spreading Aliens or even the hunting Predator. And we as audience are not spared many of the details. If you don't like to see blood, this will not be a pleasant movie for you.Unfortunately it doesn't change pace very much and the ending is too predictable. So after a while having watched the killing spree it gets a little old. It's just a lot of the same and the 100 minutes it goes on seems a little too long. It delivers what I expect of it but nothing more. So, in the end an average movie, nothing to remember.5/10",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

75,ctomvelu1,Junk,4,17 July 2010,"One thing is clear watching this followup to AVP: it is obviously a Canadian job, and a quickie to boot. This means it was made on the cheap to cash in on a waning franchise. Visually and thematically, it bears no resemblance to the previous effort, which if nothing else looked terrific (as is often the case with Anderson's style-over-substance movies). Plotwise, we have a group of people caught between the warring factions and trying their darndest to survive. Most of the film was too dark to be able to follow the action, and the acting itself was awful as only a Canadian-lensed quickie can be. I was never crazy about PREDATOR 2, the one with Danny Glover in white face (remember the big finale?), but this one has that one beat by a mile in its awfulness.

76,Easygoer10,The Absolute Worst of the Lot,3,4 January 2019,"Of all tbe Alien films, including 2 prequels (6), & all the Predator films (4), & the Alien vs. Predator films (2) = 12 films; this is by far the worst of the lot. They even named an unknown (& terrible) actor ""Dallas""; obviously referring to Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt) in the original ""Alien"" film (1979). It is still the scariest horror film of all time, with the exception of ""The Exorcist"" (1973), & has been copied & given ideas to all kinds of writers & directors in the 40 years since it was released. In spite of 2 or 3 good actors (John Ortiz, Ryan Robbins, etc.), they were not used effectively. It's not the actor's fault; it is the 2 brothers that made this trash. I could see the puppeteers using sticks for the heads of the aliens & predators. Ian Whyte, who has played Aliens in several films, plus an ""Engineer"" in ""Prometheus"" (2012), an excellent film & the return of Ridley Scott 33 years after making the original film with this terrific prequel. This film is woeful compared to the first ""AVP"" in 2004, which had a solid cast, plot, & considering what they had to follow (10 films), it was pretty good. The FX were light years better than this sequel. I rated it 6 out of 10. Most copies sold of this film are ""Unrated"", but it doesn't really help. I gave it a 3, & I was being very kind. It seems like the actors have no idea what they are supposed to say, nor when they should say them. I felt bad for John Ortiz, as he is an excellent actor, who can play many different kinds of roles, although he has been typecast into a ""latino gangster"" role, too often. He speaks absolutely perfect English, but is usually not given the chance. Watch ""The Drop"" (2014), with Ortiz in a supporting role as a NY City cop. Tom Hardy, James Gandolfini, & Noomi Rapace headline the film. It is also Gandolfini's last role before he died. It is a very good film.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

78,brando647,Who turned out the lights?,7,12 May 2008,"My first concern before watching this movie was ""Did they improve on the disaster that was Paul W.S. Anderson's AVP?"" The movie, helmed now by Greg and Colin Strause, sure hasn't perfected the AVP franchise but I would say it's definitely better than the first film. This movie starts right where the previous movie ended, with the alien bursting from the chest of the dead Predator's chest on the ship. The alien (which is a hybrid of both Alien and Predator) proceeds to wreak havoc and causes the Predator scout ship to crash-land in a small Colorado town. Another Predator soon receives the distress signal from the crash and disembarks for Earth to clean up the mess.From the start, the Brothers Strause correct the first major issue with Anderson's AVP: the rating. Unlike Anderson's PG-13, teen-friendly film from 2004, the Brothers made sure this film was rated R. As a result, we get more of the science fiction violence that was missing from Anderson's. We're treated to graphic deaths that take us back to the original films; I particularly loved the scene in the hospital with the Predator's shuriken.Of course, the fact that we're finally given the gory, rated-R AVP that fans have been waiting for is nearly made pointless by the film's lighting...or, well, lack-thereof. The entire movie is dark. I don't mean dim or frightening mood lighting...I mean DARK. The majority of the movie occurs at night or in a sewer. On the right television, it won't affect the viewing experience too much but when I tried to watch it a second time on a computer, I could see NOTHING. At that point, I may as well have been listening to a book on tape. I suppose the darkness does serve some kind of purpose; I imagine seeing the Alien costumes in full light would kill their mysticism. Even WITH the darkness, I thought the Predator/Alien hybrid look kind of goofy.Similar to Anderson's version, the Brothers Strause film does not spend a whole lot of time letting you get to know the human element. There are quite a few characters introduced but, knowing that most of them are going to end up fodder for the Aliens or Predator, we don't receive much character development. While the lack of character development bothered me in Anderson's film, I didn't care in the sequel. In Anderson's movie, the humans were the center of attention (despite what the title of the movie insinuated) and yet we didn't get to know them enough to care when one died. In the Strause film, it's all about the battle so human characters are really just victims-in-waiting...character development doesn't feel necessary.The movie really drags during the first half of the movie while the characters are ""established"" but once the second half begins, it's pretty much all Alien Vs Predator action. This film has LOADS more creature fights than Anderson's movie; this film actually FELT like an 'Aliens Vs Predator' movie. So, was this a good movie? I wouldn't say it was all that great but it wasn't that bad, and it was certainly better than the first in my opinion. The filmmakers still haven't perfected the AVP formula but I would still like to see the series get another chance with another sequel...though, maybe this time, someone could turn some lights on?",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
79,moviewizguy,This Christmas there will be no peace on Earth.,2,25 December 2007,"Picking up immediately after Alien vs. Predator, a Predalien is born. The ship falls down to earth in Colorado where the aliens and predator terrorizes the town.Finally, an Alien movie where the aliens are actually on the streets! Finally, an Alien and Predator movie that can be called apocalypse! Finally, the movie was a let down! Judging from an R rating (which I had no feelings about it), I thought I would have a fun time watching this movie on Christmas. Surprisingly, with a short running time, this movie wasn't at all fast paced.I didn't find it as entertaining as the first film (in that case, called AVP). I found the first film to be better. Why? At least there was enough light in the first film to see what's going on. In here, you can't tell who was fighting who (especially since the Predalien and Predator look so similar). This movie is merely just for body counts and no story, unlike the first.Still, I like a body count movie but this movie manages to be mean spirited in some scenes (not just killing a kid, as seen from the previews). The film being R doesn't make it better. Well, most of the kills aren't off screen (some were) so I think that's the only thing better in this movie than the last. The movie was shot darker and grittier, which I have said, ruined scenes for the movie which were too dark.Also, the showdown scene was also a let down. Not as big as the one from the first. Before I have to mention anything else, don't watch the previews for this movie (especially the trailer). It'll ruin the surprises but I guess you have already seen the trailers if you wanted to see this movie. As far as no-named actor's performances go, they were all pretty decent.If you think (from what you've seen) that this will definitely be better than the first, you may be right, if you like kills and gore. You may be wrong since the film has no story to push but just another ""monster"" movie. There were some suspense here (surprisingly). Fans of these films may be disappointed. I should say rent this movie on DVD when it comes out.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

82,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Cheap, soulless, tasteless, tactless schlock. ""Aliens vs Predator: Requiem"" is the lowest point in both of the classic franchises that inspired it.",1,14 February 2015,"If ever there was an argument that an MPAA rating has nothing to do with a film's quality, it's ""Aliens vs Predator: Requiem."" After the release of the first crossover (Paul WS Anderson's ""AVP: Alien vs Predator""), there was a large degree of fan-backlash, mainly pertaining to a perceived ""neutering"" of the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" sagas with its PG-13 rating. And so, good ole 20th Century Fox decided to attempt to quell this backlash in the form of this Hard-R follow-up, helmed by visual effects artists The Brothers Strause.And did this hard R-Rating make the film better?Nope!This film easily an objectively inferior film to the original, fundamentally proving that the rating had no impact on the quality. Sure, Anderson's first entry was... well... underwhelming. But it showed a degree of effort, mainly pertaining to its wonderful set- design, some nice practical effects, and a few stylish fight- sequences. The PG-13 rating, while annoying because you could tell they had to hold back some gore and profanity, didn't really make it a ""worse"" film than it would have been with some extra gore. Just as the hard R-rating didn't make this a better film than it would have been with a PG-13. In fact, if anything, this film shows that an R-rating can be detrimental if it's there simply for the sake of having an R- rating with needless lazy violence and profanity.The Brothers Strause prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they fundamentally misunderstand how to visually and artistically convey a good story. Scene after painfully exploitive scene is just hack- tastic gore- decapitations, chests exploding, infants being gobbled up by xenomorphs, limbs blown off with lasers... it's just the cheapest of the cheap schlock. (And often also shot in poorly framed-closeups in the dark, so it's barely visible... good going!) And it's a fundamental betrayal of both franchises as they were expertly conceived by their respective creators. Meanwhile, character development and exposition are handled in the most lazy, hack-tastic fashion. The brothers clearly don't have their priorities straight or any real interest in fundamental basics of filmmaking.Remember in the first ""Predator"", when the violence actually meant something, and was used in wonderful but controlled extremes, ONLY to create a sense of threat? Remember how artistically and tastefully the attack sequences in the first three ""Alien"" films were shot? Creating a sense of Gothic horror and absolute dread?Well, evidently the Strause siblings didn't. This film has more in common with ""Friday the 13th"" than either ""Alien"" or ""Predator.""Combine that with laughable production values, dreadful cinematography, forgettable music, poor performances and one of the blandest, most clichéd scripts of the past 10 years... and you have a recipe for disaster. (Seriously... the writing was ""SyFy Chanel Original Movie"" bad.)Oh, and the new ""Predalien"" creature is silly and looks like rejected concept-art for a kid's action-figure.1 out of 10.

It really is scraping the barrel. There is honestly nothing remotely frightening here, or tension building: it is just crude and rude and about as subtle as a brick in the face.Watch it for a laugh, and some monster fun, just don't expect anything that would live up the wonders of the other films in this series.Huge disappointment.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
84,dunmore_ego,Requiem for a Dweeb.,4,3 October 2008,"Hundreds of Aliens. One Predator. No actors.The splash-slogans on the DVD packaging of ALIENS VS. PREDATOR: REQUIEM scream at us louder than the Predator's roar: ""More Blood More Guts More Gore!"" Pretty much guarantees a maximum rating of five cucumbers out of ten – if EVERYTHING ELSE is top-notch. Everything else is not.Sucking never hurt so good.Story picks up exactly where we thought it had thankfully ended in the last movie, AVP: ALIEN VERSUS PREDATOR (2004), with a cute Alien busting through the chest of a Predator onboard a Predator rescue ship. Sporting Predator-like quad-jowls (therefore affectionately called Pred-Alien by the film-makers), the little tyke quickly dispatches all the supposedly-tough Predator warriors onboard and crash-lands the ship back on Earth in a small town called Sequel Land. Whereupon Pred-Alien starts laying eggs, whereupon face-huggers face-hug every human in sight, whereupon chest-bursters emerge, and Aliens over-run Sequel Land.A decidedly hyper-masculine Predator from Predator Planet receives the auto distress signal from the downed Preda-ship and takes the express Sequel Rescue Ship to Earth (even though there was a Predator mother ship that was just leaving Earth orbit, all those Predators apparently too insubordinate to be stop-lossed and turned around to return the few hundred miles to Earth) to take on this Alien who unceremoniously capped his Predapeeps.But think about it: if the Pred-Alien can kill Predators so efficiently while still a tiny chest-burster, imagine her lethality level when she grows into one of H.R. Giger's rubber suits. And only ONE Predator goes back for the clambake? Shake out that stupid thing called Logic. Cue pointless human interest stories... Like the last film, it's another B-Actor hoedown, everyone conveying just enough emotion to get past the audition for a detergent commercial. The ex-prisoner (who looks like a model), the small-town sheriff, the dork pizza delivery guy, the college jocks, the salubrious chick who digs the dork, but jacks the jocks... But that's why there's ""more blood, more guts, more gore!"" Distraction.Credit where it's due: the Alien character was created by Dan O'Bannon and Ron Shusett (ALIEN, 1979) and the Predator character was created by Jim Thomas and John Thomas (PREDATOR, 1987) Though this movie launches another salvo that only aids marketing synergy and recognition, I can't help feeling a little sorry for the crafters of these once-ominous alien beings, their legacies being smeared more heinously than the Republicans smear men of honor and vision.Directed by The Brothers Strause (Colin and Greg, two effects supervisors whose best work as directors could definitely be said to be in front of them), REQUIEM boasts many staff who worked on both PREDATOR and ALIEN franchises; movie also retains the ominous elements of the PREDATOR soundtrack - those tribal drums, coupled with that eerie music.Then Ripley turns up.Well, not exactly. One of the human stories shows a female soldier returning home to find her daughter has bonded inseparably with her husband. Struggling to regain her daughter's trust, an Alien comes to her rescue - as her husband is mangled by an Alien, she doesn't hesitate: grabs the kid and hi-tails it like Jackie Onassis off the back of that limo in Dealey Plaza - so much for ""leaving no one behind."" She and the prison model rally the puny humans into fighting back. And fail. Need more testosterone than THAT to be Ripley, honey...Then there's a government guy who obviously works for even less than Lance Henriksen. But kinda looks like him if you squint real hard. He's the baddie (cos he's from The Government, see?).As the Aliens rip into the townsfolk, who all use magical guns (Happiness is never having to reload), the Predator, who is all alone against hundreds of Aliens, shows he's a pretty resourceful son-of-a-predatoress by using his gadgets and superior intellect (so who died and made the Predators the good guys?) in attrition against the Aliens until there remains only him and the Pred-Alien.Hundreds of clichés.

It didn't work in the previous movie. Do the brothers Krause actually realize what the title means. ""Alien versus Predator"" to me suggests a battle between two dangerous opponents. Just a simple fight between the slimy alien and the professional (alien) hunter. We only get to see them fight for maybe two minutes or so. And what happens before is the usual stuff you would expect in a low budget horror movie. The alien also looked very cheap. It didn't look like the aliens from previous movies.

86,jaredmobarak,I want Daddy to read itAliens Vs. Predator - Requiem,3,4 January 2008,"When Alien Vs. Predator hit theatres a few years back I had seen only Alien and Aliens from either franchise. I figured I didn't really need to know every single detail of both series before viewing the combo. I was absolutely right. That film took it upon itself to build up a mythology that connected the two alien races in a way to show that they have been on Earth much longer than humans. The story was pretty intriguing and the fights never overshadowed what happened on screen as far as the progression of each and their relationship with humans. Now comes the sequel throwing all that out the window. Aliens Vs. Predator - Requiem has absolutely no substance to it whatsoever. We are introduced to a captured Predator, infected by an Alien, currently finished with its inhabitant's incubation. A hybrid is born and the ship crashes, leading a Predator on his home planet to come down and clean up the mess while erasing any trace of either alien's existence. Fighting ensues, people die, and the plot never evolves or brings anything unique to the table at all.I must shake my head at John Ortiz's decision to take part in this film. The guy has impressed me the past two years and truthfully does better in this role than the movie should ever have dreamed. Unfortunately it is one of the thankless human roles that are all expendable, serving only as pawns to be killed for shock value. No character is above the plot and the fact that some live is really just the luck of the draw. Normally this would be a cool device, surprises at every turn, but here there are no stakes and death only made me shrug my shoulders or giggle at the absurdity. When the movie finally ends you feel cheated because everything is as it was at the beginning. Aliens and Predators fight and will to the end of time, hybrids seem to be stronger but really just a Predator with an Alien tongue, and extraterrestrial weaponry is something we ""are not ready for."" Yes the setup for a third installment at the conclusion is the most laughable part of the entire experience. An alien gun makes the government wonder about intelligent technology and the fact that we are not alone. Interesting that this is what is needed and the imagery of aliens that the government official sees before ordering an air strike isn't enough to realize we have visitors.I don't know whether this is supposed to be a veiled commentary on the current war or not, (the perfect opportunity with the line of ""the government wouldn't just leave us to die"" falls without response or diatribe), but if it is not, I can't see what the writers thought they were doing as this adds nothing to the mythologies of these characters. The interesting ancient relationships between the two and humanity is thrown out the window and replaced with action, guns, and acid. The lone Predatorthey seem to be smart while the Aliens just exist to procreate, how could they not have taken over easily years agojust runs amok erasing all evidence of the invasion and using humans as bait to draw out the Aliens, never killing them unless absolutely necessary. This non-violent trend towards man is not fleshed out, however, as it was in the first.So, if you like blood and violence mixed with some action at the expense of any story at allI did nod off a couple times from the boredom of seeing no progression everyou will love this film. While the acting is not unequivocally bad, Ortiz is good and Johnny Lewis isn't horrible himself, the characters have nothing to do for the short time they are on screen. Used mainly as vehicles to show the brutality our invaders can inflict, survival for no reason other than survival just isn't fascinating. No one seems to care about anyone but him/herself and you almost wish everyone would just be eliminated. The only redeeming part of the entire film is the eye-candy that is Kristen Hager. Unfortunately she isn't even that attractive. AVP-R falls short in every category.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

The acting ensemble is almost entirely unknowns; none are going to become stars based on their performance in ""AVP-Requiem."" Ariel ""Dark Water"" Gade was the only one I even recognized, let alone rooted for.As is always the case, the script sinks the film, almost from the get-go. There's no tension, no dread, no scares, no nothing. Characters are set up like duckpins to be knocked over; one of the leads isn't even introduced until 15 minutes into the movie. The resolution of the Alien infestation is lifted from ""Return of the Living Dead,"" and the epilogue teaser makes one simply moan, ""No, please, God, no more!"" The dialog stinks, the characters are cardboard targets of opportunity, and the set-piece Alien/Predator battles are darkly lit and edited to within an inch of comprehensibility. All in all, watching ""AVP-Requiem"" is like chowing down a McMeal: tasteless pap you just know isn't any good for you.Glad I scored this one at the library. Based on the prior entry in this wretched monster smackdown series, I knew I wasn't in for much. The gore quotient bumped things back to the needed ""R"" rating, but production value overall slumped badly, and ""AVP"" was no big shakes to begin with. Watch only if you must, and even if someone gave it to me for free, I'd never add it to my DVD collection.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
89,vip_ebriega,Isn't it time to put the series into hypersleep yet?,3,20 December 2009,"My Take: An violent and overly-gory follow-up with poor lighting and badly-choreographed fight sequences.Among the others, I hated the original AVP: ALIEN VS. PREDATOR. To me, it was more like a clever marketing campaign that comes with a stupid movie. Though I hate to admit it, if it weren't for the marketing for AVP, I wouldn't have been introduced to one of the most enduring sci-fi franchises ever. It was the reason why I still revere ALIEN as one of the best sci-fi movies ever made, and ALIENS as one of my favorite films of all time. Although AVP was met with enormous dissatisfaction, it did earn enough to guarantee that people will pay to see a rematch.And a rematch it is! ALIEN VS. PREDATOR - REQUIEM (AVPR) brings back the dueling abominations from outer space, this time given the full freedom to violently rip each other apart as the series returns to its R-rated roots (finally escaping the bloodless restraints of the PG-13 rated AVP). Former FX-gurus-turned directors Colin and Greg Strause (dubbed The Brothers Strause) bring back the ""R"" for AVPR, but that doesn't really make it a good thing. Although this is a little better than the first one, AVPR is still marred by the same elements that made the first one so bad, and then some. As usual, the human characters (this time played by even more unfamiliar faces) are bland and uninteresting, and unlike the original movies, there is as complete lack of suspense.What the film lacks in suspense, however, The Brothers Strause makes up for in extreme gore and violence that are intended to disgust its audience. But ""disgust"" isn't really the same as ""scary"", and while The Brothers Strause manage to keep audience covering their eyes, that isn't really anyone's idea of a swell time. R-rated or not, some of the violence here is just plain gross. Worse, they even shoot them either with poor lighting or shaky camera work that even the most thrilling fight sequence remains incomprehensible and therefore not at all thrilling. I do admit that seeing these creatures are still cool, especially that their done more often in the old-fashioned technique of ""monster-suits"" (albeit, convincing suits) rather than lazy CGI. I admit the mechanical face-huggers are more frightening than any CGI duplicate. For that I guess, AVPR is not a total loss. But as a fan of the franchise (Yes, I liked ALIEN 3 and ALIEN: RESURRECTION), I rather leave this one out. For all of you out there, I'm sure it's best that you will to.Rating: *1/2 out of 5.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
90,one9eighty,Predalien crash lands in Colorado and has a hissy fit,4,12 February 2020,"Kind of following on from AVP - the Predalien (Predator who was impregnated by the face hugger Alien produced an Alien/Predator hybrid = Predalien) crash lands in Colorado. He goes on a rampage. Other alien face-huggers impregnate some of the populous. A Predator comes to clean up the mess. Human's from the town are in the middle of a Predator vs Alien conflict - but to make things worse, the humans find themselves divided in how to deal with the problem.I keep questioning whether I have actually seen this - then I watch it - then I remember that I did watch it but washed the memory from my brain. I'm not saying the film is garbage; just it's not that great. This is more a horror and gore film trying to justify an R-Rating. Previous versions of either monster franchise have been thrillers, horrors, suspense, and action rolled into one - this isn't as eloquent and just comes across as brash as a result. The lack of depth and the pacing make the film come across as something that just happens rather than there being logic, conflict, resolution or any need to relate of care.Sadly I can only give this a 4 out 10 and that's being kind.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
91,fwomp,What the ...!,1,20 May 2008,"There's bad cinema, and there's really bad cinema. And then there's AvP Requiem. I do sympathize with the cast and crew, however, having a budget of only $40 million. With today's high-tech blue screens, CGI and special effects computers, $40 million ain't much. But it should still be possible to make a fair film from that meager amount.Regardless of budgetary constraints (PITCH BLACK cost only $23 million to make), one would hope for at least some cool camera shots, great action sequences, and good gadgets. Not so. The filming is dark. Too dark. In fact, it was so dark I couldn't tell who was doing what to whom. ""Are they having sex? Or is that blood spurting from someone's eye?"" Next problem: main character. Who was it?! I have no idea. If someone out there in FilmLand knows, please advise. At first I thought it might be Dallas Howard (Steven Pasquale), a down-on-his-luck excon trying to find his way after his release from jail. But no, we quickly move away from him and on to ...a mother named Kelly (Reiko Aylesworth, MR. BROOKS) who's just returned from military service and is trying to reconnect with her young daughter Molly (Ariel Gade, DARK WATER). But no, we then move on to Dallas' brother Ricky (Johnny Lewis, a pizza delivery boy whose crush on a local hottie has him in hotter water with some local bullies. But no, then we move on (fleetingly) to Colonel Stevens (Robert Joy) who somehow, someway, knows that there's a serious threat to national security in this small town and is prepared to do whatever is necessary to eliminate it. Perhaps the main character was the Predator/Alien hybrid? Or the Predator that comes from Predatoria (my made up name for their homeworld) to kick some serious hybrid booty? Or maybe ...I don't know! When you have two such major weaknesses in a film (poor lighting and no main character to follow), you've pretty much set yourself up for disaster. Fans of the graphic novels might have fun sitting through it, but for regular ol' scifi buffs, this one's a no-go.(P.S.

93,petra_ste,How far the mighty have fallen...,2,16 May 2008,"I'd love to take a peek at Shane Salerno's first draft of this script: I bet it's scribbled on a napkin or toilet paper. ""Predalien comes to Earth, Aliens kill morons, Predator kills Aliens"".After the remarkably bad Alien Versus Predator (AvP) by hack Paul W. S. Anderson, I guess pretty much every moviegoer suspected this sequel by the Brothers Strause was going to be another abomination: for once, expectations were met.This atrocious flick is terribly written, poorly paced; you get much better set-pieces and character development when a six-year-old plays with toy soldiers and plastic monsters. Most of the action in AvP 2 consists of creatures crawling in the dark before they are eventually blown up by the Predator's cannon.Yes, I guess the lighting, or better its lack thereof, does deserve a special mention: this movie feels like a night vision test concocted by a particularly embittered optometrist. I recall few other major productions with crucial events so constantly hidden by a pitch-black environment.Still, what is really unforgivable is how mundane and boring the whole thing feels. Even the cinematic atrocity that was AvP 1 at least had more imaginative plot and setting; it was very badly executed, true, but at least its premise was a little more compelling than this. Never I would have expected to see, in a movie about two revered sci-fi monsters, a love triangle between a pizza delivery guy, a blonde bimbo and her jerk boyfriend. A few tweaks and this tripe could have been one of those abysmal Komodo versus Cobra flicks seen on Saturday morning TV.2/10",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
94,spookyrat1,Dim View in All Respects,3,13 September 2018,"Having not seen this movie for years, yet vaguely remembering I didn't much like it, I made the mistake of recently reacquainting myself with it, to reexamine my feelings. What a mistake! It's a mess and rightfully saw off any more wistful ideas of extensions to the AVP franchise. There are plenty more reviews here that go into minute detail of this clunker's myriad failings (second rate cast, second rate characters, second rate story, rookie co-directors etc.). I'd just like to focus on one major area causing the movie to fail miserably and that is the LIGHTING. This is an ""action movie"", where rather than witnessing the action, the directors are asking you to imagine what is happening, because for 95% of the action sequences, I defy anyone to actually tell me what the dickens is going on and whose involved, due to the all-blanketing darkness of the scenes. There's no doubt the directors/producers were aware of the ordeal potential audiences were bound to suffer, as once or twice during the film, characters lamely reiterate, that the power/lighting has gone down (supposedly part of the plot). Whatever you thought of the first 4 Alien films and the first 2 Predator films, one thing I believe we can all agree upon, is that we can clearly see what's going on, even in plainly low-light situations. Predator 2's train sequence for instance ended up being low-light, but was brilliantly edited, so that we didn't fail to be uninvolved with Bill Paxton's character's desperate fight to save passengers and himself. All that ends with AVPR. It becomes a case of your guess is as good as mine as to what is happening onscreen; a dire result IMO for an intended action film.

Of course, curiosity got the better of me and I put the disc in the machine and watched it. I have to say my friends, on this occasion, were correct. It sucks pretty much all the way through. I won't bother with a plot synopsis, but if you've seen the Alien movies, the Predator movies and any slasher movie, you've seen this.So why the massive score I hear you ask. Well, credit where it's due, the special effects weren't too bad and I did like the way the 5.1 surround sound was done. Apart from that, an awful script, that was so predictable it wasn't true, some adequate acting, but no better than you'll see in your average slasher flick and lots of darkness to cover up the guys in the rubber suits (that's the Aliens & the Predators for those that can't work that out) all added up to one big let down I'm afraid.So, if you love the Alien movies, as I do, love the Predator movies (even the rather bad AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004)), as I do, then I beg you; please give this one a miss.

97,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"A dark and depressing ""Requiem""",4,28 December 2007,"I was looking forward to this film ever since I first got wind of it going into production. My hopes weren't too high since the first movie was only OK (decent Friday night fun), but when I saw that this film was going to be released with an R rating, I just thought it might have the intensity that the first one lacked.Sadly, the ""Requiem"" of the title seemed to be playing for those hopes of mine. First off, the film is dark. Very dark and I don't mean tonally, I mean literally as it is very hard to see anything in certain parts of the movie. The kicker to that is that there is a scene where the power goes off in the city and then you can see even less. There is nothing wrong with darkness in a monster movie, but when the only purpose for darkness is to create suspense (or hide mediocre special effects) then the movie just doesn't manage to cut it. Darkness alone can't make Aliens scary anymore, because we all know what they look like so the film really should have used something else. An atmosphere of danger with all sorts of eerie sounds might be a good choice, since then at least we won't know where those nasty Aliens and Predators are, however, the film manages to make that into another problem. The sound here is almost an assault on the senses with loud sounds being the main tool to provide thrills. From ships flying in the soundless vacuum of space to Predators switching vision modes in their helmets; it is all so loud! Needlessly loud. There are even moments when a Predator merely turns around and there is a loud ""whooosh"" of sorts. I thought these creatures are supposed to be quiet hunter/killer types, but they are only when the plot demands it as there are a few scenes where this supposedly loud creature sneaks up soundlessly on victims.If you notice I wrote the last instance of ""creature"" in the singular and that's because there is only one Predator throughout the movie, aside from the introductory sequence. But there are lots of Aliens running about here and there, which is strangely reflective of the ""plot"" here, if there is one. The film is pretty disjointed and doesn't seem to be adding up to anything interesting for most of its running time. It just jumps back and forth between the Predator on its hunt to cheesy teen drama and the county sheriff investigating deaths. When these plots lines do meet, the result is rather bland and doesn't really go anywhere we haven't been before. And leaves us with only more of the same to expect. --- 4/10Rated R for violence/horror. Ages 13+",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

100,DonFishies,"A vast improvement over AVP, but more for fans than anyone else",5,2 January 2008,"For better or worse, I felt that the original AVP: Alien vs. Predator film was an abomination to the very medium it was created for. Lacking the spirit, intensity and all around enjoyment of the film series' they were based off of, it has slowly become one of the worst films I have ever had to put myself through. But after watching the R-rated trailer for the sequel, AVP-R: Aliens vs. Predator  Requiem, I began to hold out some hope that the new filmmakers would salvage and improve upon everything that was mysteriously absent in the first film. And while it is above and beyond superior than the first film, it is still nowhere near as great as the earlier films.In short, AVP-R opens mere moments where the first film left off with the birth of the 'Predalien' hybrid. It takes out the entire Predator crew, and the ship crashes in a forest in remote Colorado. A Predator in his home world is alerted of the crash and speeds over to try and eliminate the alien threat, while the Predalien and his Face Huggers begin to lay waste to the town. But not everyone is willing to go down quietly.Right from the start, it is clear that this film was not made for anyone other than fans of either series. Trademark score cues, sounds, weapons and even the actual look of the Aliens and Predators are all taken from the earlier films. Unlike AVP, AVP-R actually makes a genuine attempt at capturing the spirit and the look of the originals, and at the very least, makes it feel like it is an actual member of the series as a whole. The film is sprinkled with doses of nostalgic moments, and actually violent kills (unlike the trashy PG-13 material in AVP) make this film out to be exactly what the first one should have been like in the first place.But unfortunately, the greatness of feeling like an Alien or Predator film only lasts so long.For one thing, there is next to no story. The film is basically just the one Predator hunting down Aliens, and killing everything that gets in the way. And for the most part, some of the things he does are actually quite interesting (and in momentary instances, felt like a hybrid of a hard-boiled detective story). But since he cannot really communicate in English, all of the speaking parts that move the Predator's story from moment to moment are done by third-rate actors negated to supporting status in favour of these creatures. And for some reason, despite this fact, writer Shane Salerno and directors Colin and Greg Strause decided it would be best to pump in as many human subplots as possible, and not allow any of them to give any depth to any of the human characters. They are all one-dimensional cut-outs at best, and listening to some of their dialogue makes it quite imaginable that a drinking game is not far off for the DVD's release. While it is nowhere near as badly written as AVP, it still manages to be even worse than material found in some direct-to-video horror flicks, or even those hastily produced PG-13 horror flicks that open at number one at least once a month, and then fall off hard until the eventual Unrated DVD. Doing away completely with the human subplots probably would have made the film a whole lot enjoyable.What the film is also plagued with is really harsh editing. Much like the first film (only with a whole lot more blood and gore), the fight sequences and kills are cut so fast that it becomes a test of endurance just trying to comprehend what is going on. Factor in the fact that much of the film takes place in the dark, and it becomes clear that if you can actually tell what is happening, you are a whole lot better off than the rest of the audience. I found myself enjoying the action one moment, and then squinting and blinking hard trying to figure out what had happened the next. I realize that the music video/ADHD style editing is a favourite of newer directors (and especially those working within the confines of PG-13), but making the action take place so fast is not making things better for anyone, especially those who came out looking for an R-rated brawl.It also does not help that the film drags a bit in the middle. Whether this is because of the fact that the human scenes are complete wastes of time (or border on unneeded exploitation-era tactics) or because the filmmakers wanted to do more with the film is not really known. And since the film is more than ten minutes shorter than the original, that is saying a lot.But what the film lacks in story (human-wise at least) and editing, it makes up for in its ambition. The creators are clearly toying with the mythos of these popular creatures right from the start, and as the film progresses, some of the ideas they bring in are just extraordinary. A look at the home planet of the Predators, unique Alien births and even the thought of the gumshoe Predator are all different and almost original concepts working off of existing, and almost clichéd ones. Without really spoiling some of the fun (and grotesqueness) of some of these plots points, it is suffice to say that if you come as a fan of the earlier works, you will probably see some new elements that will actually somewhat impress you.AVP-R, while being an improvement over the atrocious AVP, is still a far way off from being comparable to the series' that spawned it. It is an entertaining film, but there are way too many things acting against it to make it more than just a popcorn flick for fans of Alien or Predator.5/10.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

The acting is horrible and the performances worse yet are horribly stale.

The story was a continuation of the last film's, *&^%! There are some new xenomorph designs and a new creature, a mutt that's been dubbed the ""Predalien"".

102,innocuous,"""Loaded with violence""?!? How can you tell?",3,15 May 2008,"I gave AVPR three stars mostly because it actually had a title, it had a plot (thin as it is and dumb as a box of rocks), and it proceeded from one scene to the next in some fashion. The filmmakers also went to the trouble of having SFX of one type or another and made copies of the script for everyone.Other than that, I'm not sure what there is to recommend this film. The DVD version is so dark that you can't really see any of the action scenes. There are several scenes, including one in a hardware store, where I didn't know someone had just been killed on-screen until I saw his/her body on the floor. Similarly, most of the fight sequences between the Predator and the PredAlien (don't ask) are shot in a way that makes it virtually impossible to tell them apart. (Their profiles and silhouettes are understandably very similar.) I was stopping the movie every few minutes to say, ""How did the Predator get all the way across town? Oh, wait a minute. That's not the Predator...it's the PredAlien."" Many reviewers (and the film's producers) have mentioned that they saw some parallels between the Predator and a ""cleaner."" If there are parallels, they don't extend to competence. A ""cleaner"" is supposed to go in and handle messy jobs in the most effective manner possible. This particular Predator has some weird agenda I don't understand at all. For example, he stops in the middle of tracking the PredAliens to not just kill, but skin, a sheriff's deputy looking for a lost father and son. Where's the point in that? (Winston Wolf would have just blown the guy away and kept walking.) As the movie progresses, the Predator just starts doing all sorts of weird and non-productive things. I guess Predators suffer from lack of focus.Let me mention again that the DVD version of this film is ridiculously, unbelievably dark.I don't find the ending to be pessimistic, or even far-fetched.

Where AVP (2004) had only a moderately larger budget, the thing that made AVP (2004) much better than this film is the script/plot. AVP (2004) had a story that you could actually follow and a plot that wasn't as all over the place like a cat in a tumble dryer.This film also follows the CLASSIC C-movie formula of having a tonne of unknown actors and a single hot female character that can keep your attention on screen and stop you from just switching the movie off (that role was obviously filled by Kristen Hager in this film).This movie is unfortunately one of the MANY movies made throughout history which wasn't made because it would better a franchise or tell a story... no no... This movie was made because the studio thought it would make them money (and it DID actually roughly double their money).

106,dr_foreman,Proof that you can't go home again...,1,28 June 2008,"The Alien films are science fiction classics. Well, the first three are classics - the fourth one is some kind of bad dream.The Predator films are...good fun. I like the first one especially.Now then, the Aliens vs. Predator films are simply a disgrace. I understand that many sci-fi fans always wanted to see these legendary creatures fight on screen, but to be honest the idea has always held little appeal to me. It's just a sign, really, that both movie franchises are lacking in inspiration and, in fact, limping towards utter extinction. Like embarrassing, drunken party guests, the Aliens and the Predators don't know that it's time to *leave*, already, so our pleasant 1980s memories of them can remain untarnished.So, about this movie in particular. The direction, by the brothers Strause (?), is awful. Scene follows upon scene with little or no logical connecting material between them. The cutting is abrupt. The lighting is dark and murky, to the point that almost nothing can be seen - not the Aliens, not the Predators, and not even Reiko Aylesworth looking foxy.Worse yet, the fights - when they're even visible - are boring. What's so great about watching Predators ping Aliens from great distances?Then there's the characters. You know, I used to think it would be interesting to see an Alien movie set on Earth, but I never paused to consider that such a setting would involve more boring humans cluttering up the joint, such as a beleaguered small-town sheriff (yawn), a reformed crook (ho-hum), and a hot high school girl who takes off some - but not all - of her clothes (yay, lingering sexism!) I couldn't get invested in any of them, so when they died - often in the gross and exploitative manner of teenagers in a slasher movie - I cared not.One wonders if Shane Salerno cobbled together this script in a weekend. One wonders why the studio approved it. One wonders why there isn't a more serious effort being made to revive the Alien franchise.

107,Antagonisten,Crap,2,9 April 2008,"I watched this movie against my better judgment. Since i'm in Europe i got the chance to see some reviews a while before i got the chance to see the actual movie. And i realize now that i should have ignored the movie altogether (like that was so hard to figure out to begin with).The always-crappy Paul W.S. Anderson is not involved in this movie which i saw as a plus (Anderson has yet to make a movie i can appreciate). Unfortunately Andersons absence didn't help. I don't know who these directing brothers are, but i can tell you that they are no Wachowski-brothers. I have seldom seen an action movie with so much action and gore, and yet so little excitement. In that regard this might as well be a Paul W.S Anderson-movie since he's the expert at making loads of noise and commotion without creating any suspense.Anyway, enough with the Anderson-bashing (although he deserves to be bashed). What did i like about this movie? Well, precious little actually. The special effects are decent, the monsters look the way they should and there is plenty of gore to go around. Actually the gore is also a step in the right direction. I can't stand the Hollywood-thing where they go for a PG-13 rating when it's supposed to be an action-movie! In action-movies people get shot and beaten up, that usually produces blood and cursing. You do the math. Unfortunately gore is not enough to save this mess.That brings us to what i didn't like. Well first of all the movie has no plot. A ship crashes and the Aliens start killing everything they see, while the Predator just runs around killing them and the occasional human. And kill people they do. There are huge amounts of people getting ripped apart and dismembered in this movie. The problem is that it's all so painfully predictable. The scene is always set in a way that would have made advertising in last weeks paper less predictable. Also there is a serious lack of weight in the action scenes. They just seem...flimsy to me.No, i have finally decided that i won't watch another Alien-movie or Predator-movie unless a real director takes charge. Of course that would preferably be James Cameron, but i guess it's a snowball's chance in hell of that ever happening. But until at least someone competent takes care of it, i'm out.

It borrows very heavily from Aliens, Predator, Resident Evil and The Return of the Living Dead.We start where the last film left off with the Predalien chest-buster which causes the ship to crash, all the Predators on board are killed by the Predalien. Some face-huggers are also set free and obviously go do their thing on the local people of the town where the ship crash lands.It was pretty obvious as the only one of it's kind that the Predalien was going to turn out to be a Queen (that's what it's doing to the pregnant woman in the hospital, you see the eggs going down her throat).Basically we're following a towns battle for survival and a Predator's hunt of a new species for a trophy. We have a mum who is also a soldier with her daughter (which echoes Ripley & Newt at several points during the movie).We have the fight for survival, the sequence in the hospital staircase directly mirrors the Marines in the atmosphere processing plant in Aliens, right down to someone being grabbed from the wall and someone falling down a stairwell.The sequence where all the National Guard get killed is lifted wholesale from Alien, likewise the ride in the Armoured car (mirrors the APC in Aliens). Also the battle to the helicopter on the roof mirrors Ripley's rooftop escape to the drop-ship in Aliens.The Predalien looks good, the whole back story of an airlift coming to rescue people when it's really an air-strike to destroy the town (which was so obvious) which is right out of both Resident Evil and The Return of the Living Dead. Escaping a nuke in a helicopter which later crashes is also right out of Resident Evil 2.The film is very low on new ideas indeed. We are introduced to the character of Ms. Yutani right at the end of the film so we see more about how The Weyland-Yutani Corporation comes into being.The film is a little action heavy and could have done with a bit more thought to scripting and new ideas. Having seen all the Alien and Predator films this is by far the worse yet. Could have been so much better. As far as the cinema version goes? For the hardcore fans only.If your lucky enough to buy the Unrated Cut DVD release then you get a far better movie which is much more enjoyable & far superior to the awful cinema release. The extra (7 or 11) minutes improve the poor plot no end, it actually makes watching the film much more bearable. Even enjoyable!If you get the chance to listen to both sets of commentary then you'll see exactly why the film is so unoriginal so often (the directors are huge fans of James Cameron & claim this movie to be their homage to Aliens, personally I say they couldn't come up with any better ideas than Cameron so they decide to steal all his best ones and say it was a tribute as opposed to copyright theft), the much better commentary comes from the sfx guys.Worth watching if its the unrated cut on DVD.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
109,LazySod,Way too tame,4,14 January 2008,"Picking up where Alien versus Predator (2004) left of this film returns the aliens and the predators to Earth once more. And once again the human inhabitants are unwillingly stuck in the middle. There is no more storyline to it than just that, but that isn't too bad. In this kind of film there is not much need for much more than just that.What it does need though is a good strong tension field. It needs characters you can care for, it needs them to be chased around, it needs them to end up dead on unexpected moments or escaping alive when no one thinks that possible. Quite sadly that tension field is missing. Every single event in the film is predictable. What is left is a stream of gore intermixed with things that happen in the average soap series but that are mostly out of place in a film like this one.Add to that that the characteristics of the aliens and the predators are no longer matching up with the ones we got introduced to in several films before this one. And lastly, add to that the fact that the ending sequence of the film is downright stupid. That sum is the end result of this film: not good at all, way too tame. As much of a shadow to the first AvP film as that one was a shadow to the original Predator and Alien films.Could have been a lot better, should have been a lot better. 4 out of 10 bored aliens",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
110,hellholehorror,It lacked all imagination,4,1 October 2017,Boring script. It lacked all imagination. It meant that any attempts at good effects or good acting were totally lost in dire dialogue and emotionless characters. The aliens and the predators were not scary in the least. They were too easy to kill. The whole movie lacked suspense and any dark atmosphere. The ending was confusing. On the other hand there was a fair amount of violent creature antics and the use of computers was very restrained. It looked better than the previous battle that had no relevance to anything. At least this one was set here and now although it could have been set in the future equally well. It is good that it wasn't set at the North Pole or whatever. It was cheesy which excused some of the bad points. Overall I would say that this is not a total waste of time but it is not productive either. A step up from the previous as it is cheesy and violent although lacking atmosphere.,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
111,Rautus,A great rematch,10,19 January 2008,"AVP: Alien Vs Preadtor was alright and entertaining but it did have a few problems, one was that the Rating was PG-13 and that meant that the gore that the two franchises have been known for having was removed. Two was that the Predators and Aliens don't fight each other enough has they should and three was that the film took a while for the action to get going. AVP R: Aliens Vs Preadtor - Requiem is a great follow up to the first AVP, the film returns the series to it's roots by having the R-Rating again which means some gore, more fights between the two creatures and the action does pick up rather quicker. The film does have a few problems such has plot holes, for example the Preadators not knowing a Alien was inside one of their members or the main Predator called the Wolf going around dissolving all evidence yet leaves a man hanging on the tree skinned.Although there are plot holes in this movie that doesn't stop AVP R: Aliens Vs Preadtor - Reqiuem from being enjoyable. The film had some cool effects, some nice gore in parts, awesome Preadtor weapons and some good action scenes. The PredAlien looked pretty cool and the look for the Xenomorphs are from the James Cameron style in Aliens, the Predator looked cool especially with it's duel Shoulder Cannon's.The film starts right after the events of AVP: Alien Vs Predator with the PredAlien bursting through the Preadtor's chest. The PredAlien when fully grown then goes and starts killing off the Predators in the ship, one of the Preadtors fires it's Shoulder Canon destroying a piece of the ship, the Preadator ship crashes on Earth. The FaceHuggers escape from their containers and two of them attach themselves onto a man and his son who were out hunting. On the Predator planet one of them receives the distress call from the Predator ship and observes what happened, Wolf then gets his gear and flies off to Earth to clean up the mess. After a while the father and son wake up and suddenly the Chestbusters burst out and the nightmare slowly starts to begin as the residents of the town start getting impregnated by the Facehuggers and attacked by the Aliens. Wolf lands on Earth and begins his mission to clean up the Alien outbreak before it gets too much out of control.AVP R: Aliens Vs Predator - Requiem may have a few problems but it is an entertaining movie and a great sequel. It may not be for everyone but if you're a fan of the Alien and Predator movies then this movie is defiantly worth a look. Check this out. 10/10",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

""See? No monsters."" Damn.

113,michaelarmer,Sci-Fi B-Movie +,6,7 March 2020,"Yeah, this plays like a B-Movie, the actors are not well known, and they don't act so great, the special effects are not the best and it looks like its filmed on the cheap, that does not stop it from being a good movie, but in this case it did.Its the latest and possibly last sequel in the Alien/Predator films, when they made the connection with the two in the earlier film, it was good and it worked as a storyline, and that was a good-ish film, not as good as the individual Alien and Predator films, but Ok, but this sequel is not up to that standard.Apart from the special effects, they overdo the Aliens, creating too many, and with only one predator to kill them, it just seems a bit daft, I was going to say far-fetched, but you can't get much ""far-fetched"" than two lots of Aliens fighting each other on our planet! It is also too guesome and not so dramatic, but it is exciting and the final battle had me glued to the screen despite me predicting the ending correctly, it still had me on the edge of my seat, literally.Most of the film was in darkness, are aliens never active in the day time ?, so it was like a film noir, or a typical B-Horror movie, this loses something for me, why can you not have it in the daytime as well, the first Predator film did, and that was excellent, also some of the scenes moved too fast, you could not get a clear grip on what was going on, and miss some of the action, but that is cheap film making for you.!It is currently rated 4.7 on here, I think it is a bit better than that, but only just, so I gave it a six.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
114,Lebowskidoo,"Nice Try, Next Time Switch the Lights On!",8,2 July 2020,"This sequel to the original AVP ups the ante by going for that R-rating. There's a rapid succession of gory deaths, but the decision to film everything in darkness means we can almost never see anything too clearly.It's not a terrible movie (sorry, I just love these movies) but the characters are very lacking in depth, and are never given any time to develop prior to being gouged or dismembered. This is one of the cruelest entries in either series if you consider some of the victims here. They now had that R-rating and were going for it! It's all edited in a way to confuse the viewer, the action moves too quickly at times. It's also the shortest movie of either series. A little more fleshing out ( no pun intended) of the characters and some lighting adjustments would have helped.The Predalien was a brilliant idea, but I'm not sure I ever got a good look at it. I think the first AVP was better simply because the aliens were more bad ass than here, where they are less intimidating and are too easily dispatched. I guess this is the weakest link in the series overall, but I still liked most of it. I'm not that hard to please though, I'm a real ho for these movies!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
115,skybrick736,Alien vs. Predator: Requiem (5/10),5,14 August 2016,"Right from the get go the viewers are immersed into some pretty heavy stuff as a couple of facehuggers take out two unsuspecting characters. At this point it is easy to realize that AVP: Requiem will be an anything goes type of film. This is an approach that a lot of horror movies don't really follow to often to be so brutal but it does hurt the film in a variety of ways. First off, there is absolutely zero character development leading to not one single likable character. Secondly, the plot and story doesn't really flow at all since there is abundance of characters that have to be introduced. The film is definitely a Catch 22 in this fact that it's cool to see a no mercy approach but as a quality film, it just isn't there. AVP: Requiem is geared to a certain type of viewer and limits itself big time. Still very much worth the watch to see all the Alien and Predator action and also is probably a little bit better than the first one.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
116,johnnymacbest,"With a better script and acting, this could've been a good action movie.",4,29 December 2007,"I was a huge fan of the Alien and Predator movies when I was a kid. Sure some of the dialog was corny and all (though Aliens had some great ones) but it was delivered with charm and humor. Not so here in the sequel to the abysmal Alien VS Predator (2004). At least in the first film, I somewhat cared about the human characters to a certain extent. But this film could've had a much better script and acting. I wasn't expecting much, given the ""source material"" but I couldn't help but wonder why the ""bleep"" Fox would put out such a sketchy script? There are some things that seemed illogical to me; for instance why would the Predator kill the police officer? If he had lived, his comrades wouldn't believe him anyway. It would've made sense had the Predator turned invisible while pouring that blue goo on the bodies. Another thing that irritated me was the way they ruined the Predator's personality. He goes from being the silent, mysterious bad ass like he was in Predator and the first half of the film to a John Wayne ripoff near the end of the movie. Fox obviously screwed themselves in the ass.I could go on and on, but then again, it would be pointless, considering the nature of the film's material. But I have to say as good as the Alien and Predator movies were in the past, this film falls short of them tremendously. The acting was flat, the jokes were dry as a desert, and the story was half-baked to the point of unbelievability with illogical and contrived clichés that would irritate fans and casuals alike. With a better script and acting, this film could've been a good action movie.On that note: Cameron or John McTiernan (of Die Hard fame) would've been an EXCELLENT choice.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
117,akshatmahajan,Unbearable,3,22 September 2020,"AvP:R was a big disappointment. Not even a single thing was good in this movie.First of all, it was shot in too darkness. Script was terrible and boring. Acting was so bad. The direction could not be more worst. The action was bad. The movie was unnessarily stretched. Dialogues were bad. This movie is made just to make you sleep because you get high level bored.Overall, I will not recommend this movie to anyone. First part is good. Just watch that if you want to. Leave this part.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
118,xamtaro,Fan-happy Monster brawl movie,7,24 May 2008,"Personally i didn't watch this in the cinema after my friend warned me about how bad it was. But i picked up the DVD and boy was i proved wrong. It is a GREAT movie which really captured the feel of the Aliens and Predators in the precious films. Unlike the AVP1 which kinda played out like a bad video game and should be re-titled ""Alien Pwns Predator"", AVP2 seems like 20th Century Fox's way of saying ""sorry for the first film, now we give you ""Aliens get pwned by Predator"".The main draw of the film for me is all the various homages to the previous 6 films of the Aliens/Predator franchise. 1) First the humans. Many cite as The film's weak point. But I actually applaud the directors' use of a very familiar B horror movie setting(small secluded town), and uninteresting stock human characters. Why?? Cos the movie is about Aliens and Predators. Not humans. You don't want the humans to steal the limelight from he monsters. Anyway there is the reference to ""Aliens""'s Ripley and Newt in the form of Kelly the army mother and her daughter plus Dallas's personality is very similar to that of Alien1's Dallas. The whole small secluded town thing is kinda interesting as we get to see the process of a human colony infestation and not just the results of such an infestation as seen in Aliens.2)The dark frantic fights. Again, critics cite the dark settings and quick cut fight jumpy scenes between the monsters as another weak point. Well look back at Aliens. Many scenes were just as dark and have the aliens as mere silhouettes in shadow. Quick cuts and jumpy editing are also used in both franchise movies when the monsters attack(just a quick slash, the guy screams, some frantic jumpy struggling and thats it. ). This is just the directors' way of staying true to the original feel of the movies.(I feel it is kinda sad that the creators get criticized for trying to stay true to the original) 3)The music. Brian Tyler scores again. Like his previous works on sequels like Rambo4, Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift and Children of Dune, Tyler stays true and uses many music cues from the original, blending them seamlessly with his own style. For AVP2 he manages to blend mainly James Horner's frenzied, frantic, savage score of Aliens with Alan Silvestri's militaristic, Primal music of Predator. There are also nods to the music of the other alien and predator movies found throughout the score. Only problem is, the music feels too ""grand"" for this kinda movie. Its a ""A"" list score in a B horror movie but hits all the right notes.4)Many Scene homages to the original films. I wont post too many spoilers. Just go watch the original films and then compare to AVP2 too see all the homages. From the start to even the last scene. So far i count 15 homaged scenes or lines. There is more.5)sound effects from the original films.6)The new stuff like the Predator's whip and laser claymores and the Predalien. (Trivia: The Predalien is not a just ""Predalien"" but a young Predalien Queen, hinted at in the commentary track. It has the Alien queen's crested head and can spawn baby aliens like a Queen.)The only thing i didn't like about the film(hence why it did not receive a 10/10 enjoyment score) was the ending. Dropping a nuke in the middle of America?? seems pretty ""off"" to me. But hey, they needed a big explosion or how else can they reference a similar scene in Aliens? Another thing was the sudden over-powering of the Predator. If i hadn't read the novels or comics, i would be stunned. The Aliens, so invincible in the previous AVP film are nothing more than barking puppies to this new Predator. He doesn't even get fazed by the Acid Blood.(OK the novels and comics do state that the Predator armor is supposed to be acid resistant, though that wasn't the case in AVP1 and that experienced predators know the ""pressure points""on the aliens to hit and cut so as to have minimal acid blood splat. But like i said, without reading the novels and comics, i wouldn't have known this.)Basically i enjoyed this movie. It is not a thought provoking award winning movie, But seriously, with a title like ""Aliens vs Predator"" do you expect something like E.T or the Godfather?? I watch this movie to be entertained by Aliens fighting Predator not to be left pondering the meaning of life and friendship or trying to unravel plot twists.THIS is the AVP movie i had always wanted to see. The re-match of the year which i enjoyed very much. Like the Predalien, it is a great blend of the Aliens and Predator franchise, taken to the next level. I shall be awaiting a 3rd installment with much anticipation",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
119,richard_sleboe,Worlds apart,3,1 January 2008,"I remember enjoying the first installment, but that might have been largely because of its inventive setting: an ancient underground pyramid hidden in the polar ice cap. By contrast, ""Requiem"" is set in the sewers of nondescript Gunnison County, Colorado. It feels so fabricated I was surprised to find out the place actually exists. With the poor lighting, hectic editing and heavy use of blurred first-person monster perspective, it's almost impossible to tell aliens and predators apart. I like the idea of following a single, lone off-world ranger rather than copy-pasting herds of CGI ogres, but it's largely wasted on this under-scripted and poorly produced sequel. The fact that the lead predator's Rastafarian headgear makes it look like Jar Jar Binks doesn't exactly help. For want of other thrills, my favorite moment is when the village slut (Kristen Hager) finally gets pinned to the wall. She had it coming.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

The locals begin to go missing, some are found skinned, soon the authorities have to call in the National Guard to deal with the escalating troubles. A jaded script can't help but tell us this is one sequel to far, this film is just a series of meaningless kills of characters we don't know or don't care to know.

Stay away, far away.I hated pretty much everything about this movie from the acting, to the storyline, to the horrible dialog. I hated all the characters and would have enjoyed seeing them all die on the screen. There are points in the film where it almost seems like they were going for a storyline but it gets completely muddled by the horrible action sequences and then it feels as if they just gave up.

Maybe I shouldn't complain, because the Strause brothers lit their follow-up film Skyline and somehow proved themselves even more incompetent, so perhaps wondering what the hell is on screen is better than seeing what they put on screen.

The Aliens vs Predator series has so far proved my previous statement to be an accurate one. The Aliens and Predator franchises, individually, have proved very popular and enjoy a large enough fan base. Their combination has so far only worked in print. Please see my review of AvP for reference. The Alien-Predator hybrid wants to propagate and enjoys the company of pregnant women. The humans are stuck in the middle because this takes place on Earth.This being the second movie and continuation of Aliens Versus Predator, the story begins with the end of the previous movie. This would be the eruption of a Predator-Alien hybrid (fully grown it resembles a large Alien creature, with a larger head, Predator mouth and Alien dreadlocks - its a composite of both species, duh) out of the dead body of a Predator. For some unknown reason the ship with this new creature is then jettisoned back to Earth after it kills the entire Predator crew. A message is then relayed to an unknown Predator (I would like to refer to this Predator as Sherlock from now on since he seems to be part investigator along with being a tracker and a warrior) on the Predator home world(?). This is all speculation, of course, as none of the Predator's actions, motivations or purpose is ever revealed to us.I cannot wait for the day when someone will actually make an AvP movie without the humans, as they are the weakest link and generally used as filler. Considering this movie doesn't have human in the title, we spend a lot of time focusing on them. If you want to make a mindless action movie, why go 1/2 way? Go for the gold and nix the humans out of the story. Was there a need to include a budding romance arc in this film? No. Was there a need to vignette the lives of some of the people in this Colorado town? No. This isn't Magnolia, Babel or Crash. There is no need for all this background especially when the people are so cardboard and easily prone to sudden and untimely deaths at the hands of various alien creatures.The Brothers Strause, as they are referred to in the credits, attempt to create a dog-eat-dog environment with the humans, aliens and predator each as a separate and self interested group with its own agenda. Though the brothers have worked on many visual projects on many movies this is their first theatrical endeavor and it shows. Though visually stunning at times, the pacing is extremely and unnecessarily uneven. The Brothers start out by including more of the Predator behavior and world. I like this aspect (the only aspect I like). We are just given images of ""alien"" things and we are forced to extrapolate purpose and reasoning. It then turns into a human survival movie. It no longer matters why the Predator pours neon-blue sulfuric Gatorade over some of the corpses, as the now humans are the focal point.The worst part of the movie is that these two visually experienced ""directors"" have no clue what an action movie is suppose to have. A good action movie does not need a story line of any quality. A good action movie, much like its' heroes/heroines, includes a single-minded purpose. This is sorely lacking in Requiem as the true action doesn't start until well into the 2nd hour (last 20-25 minutes). The rest of the movie is a slow build up around the lives of boring and stereotypical people of a no name Colorado town. I couldn't find myself caring about any of the ""characters"" portrayed in this movie. There are no stand-out performances for a movie that should have gone straight to video.Ultimately we are left with aliens that showed up seemingly as an act of god, amass huge collateral damage and are ultimately nuked by us humans, along with the entire town, with the scope of attacking some alien home world (in the future? or possible AvP 3) that the Illuminati and our world government leaders have already known of. The End. And here I thought the end of Sweeney Todd was sudden. What is even more disheartening is the realization that Requiem is worse than AvP (something I thought impossible).To quote the homage to the first Predator movie ""cleverly"" and randomly inserted into Requiem, ""Get to the chopper"". If you or someone you know is thinking about watching this movie (where sober or not), just remember those 4 simple (and often quoted) words and just skip it. However, if you really, really, really, really feel like you need to be ready for AvP3, then just watch the last 25 minutes of the movie. You really don't need to watch anymore than that, if any at all.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
126,come2whereimfrom,Dumb Alien vrs Predator fun.,10,17 January 2008,"It seems that no-one has a good word to say about this film which is weird because as far as I was concerned it did exactly what I expected it to do. I like Aliens, I like Predators and I like to see the two knock seven bells out of each other. What I can't understand is what people want? A high-brow AVP movie? Alien hasn't been any good since the studio made Fincher release a substandard and heavily cut Alien3 and really only the first Predator was any good so why are people expecting more from the space rivals? This film has all the best bits from all the other films, an alien comes up behind someone, a predator takes care of a nasty flesh wound, an alien swims after a teenager, a predator skins people and so forth. There is no real story apart from the carnage and there really is no need for one because each section just exists to get to another alien/predator, alien/human or predator/human conflict and its great. There is also the predalien the hybrid of the two species that is quite frankly well hard, I still think they missed a trick not calling it the alienator, but that just me. Did I mention how hard it is? It's big and mean and kicks some butt. It's all set in a small town and it's all a bit much for them so they call the army in and there's more carnage and shooting. Then of course there's the scene where the predator sits down to read a book to expand his mind, no of course he doesn't, but he does bite someone's face off! Yay. Its dumb but its fun, its not going to win any awards, its not going to resurrect the ailing franchise and by the looks of things its not going to please die-hard fan boys but I am guilty as charged because I got what I expected and enjoyed it.

How FOX greenlit any of this shows extreme negligence over their product",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
128,ExpendableMan,Hiss hiss bang bang,6,14 May 2008,"If you were to tally up all the films in the Alien and Predator franchises, then this is technically the eighth entry. And just like any movie series that lasts this long, the brains behind the cameras appear to have been left in the dust way back down the line because AVP: Requiem is so stupid as to make Arnold Schwarzenegger's lines from the original 'Predator' sound like Chaucer. Yes folks, this is pedal-to-the-metal adrenaline film making packed with gore, the corpses piling up so quickly you could easily remove all dialogue and sound effects and replace it with the Benny Hill theme tune. It's not a great film...hell, it's not even a good film really, but it is an enjoyable marathon of bad taste thrills (see the incredibly messy pregnancy scene) that goes down a treat with a bowl full of nachos and a six pack on a Friday night.The backdrop to all this nonsense is the town of Gunnison, Colorado, an idyllic slice of Americana bursting with small town diners, immaculate lawns and white picket fences just aching to be vaporised in the coming xenomorph smackdown. Populated largely by D-list non-entities, the film spends a good twenty minutes or so establishing their mundane characters; bullying jock, local slut, overwhelmed sheriff, bad boy trying to make good and so forth, until a swarm of Aliens emerges from the sewers to turn them into fillet steaks. Hot on their heels comes a solitary Predator, showing up for no reason whatsoever other than the fact he gets namechecked in the title. As the body count rises, the National Guard are called in and the stage is set for one almighty free-for-all......until the directors (special effects veterans Colin and Greg Strause) proceed to ruin most of the action set pieces. Lots of the ensuing violence takes place in dimly lit rooms or sewers, masked by sheeting rain or filmed in extreme close-up where you get very little idea of what is happening. Detractors of the original AVP might have bemoaned the lack of R-rated blood-letting, but at least you could actually see what was going on. That being said there's still a lot of fun to be had. The all-new Predator-Alien hybrid for example makes for a minor breath of fresh air, especially when it gets randy in a maternity ward. Plus, the violence that is visible is so ridiculous you can't help but laugh, not least of all when two gun-toting rednecks get their heads blasted into paste at the same time.Not a terrific movie then but still an enjoyable hour and a half, even if you do struggle to remember the names of any of the characters while writing a review the following evening. The Strause Brothers should stick to special effects mind, their directing skills are nothing to write home about. If you want a respectable treatment of two science-fiction icons going head to head you really need to pick up a copy of the original comic series, but if you're willing to put up with dialogue like ""the Government doesn't lie,"" ""People are dying, we need guns,"" or ""are the monsters gone Mummy"" for the sake of claret spraying, this'll be right up your alley.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
129,michaelradny,Dumb,4,29 July 2015,"A fantastic concept doesn't usually get a second attempt after an initial fail, but after this installment, I can comfortably say no one will be investing in a third. It is just plain awful, with a dumb plot and dumb characters. Everyone in this movie has a sub-par IQ and just doesn't predict anything. One good thing I can say about this film is that the CGI is good enough to pass as an alien or predator film but the film as a whole doesn't work as an alien Vs predator film. Boring but redeems itself with a little nostalgia. Otherwise this film is a big flop and they obviously didn't learn from the first, however, in my opinion this one makes a little more sense and is slightly better than the first. F for effort and an E for execution. Pretty poor unfortunately.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
130,geminiredblue,Let The Invasion Begin!!!,8,18 December 2013,"Finally... at long last... someone had the good sense to make THE definitive ALIEN VS PREDATOR movie. For years, fans have been waiting patiently for the studios to bring these two franchises together. And what a pay-off! In a typical small town in America, there is a war being waged between the Aliens and the Predators. And caught in the middle are the humans. Though many of the human performances leave much to be desired, let's face it, the true stars of the film are the extraterrestrials. In terms of on screen violence, this movie delivers in dollops. And doesn't spare anyone (that's including children, so be warned!) While there are a few good scares along the way, the main focus is on elaborate special effects and pulse-pounding action scenes. And that's what makes this film so darn fun! So I say ""Let the invasion begin!!!""",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
131,FallenEye,AVPR: A Very Poor Requiem.,3,11 May 2018,"Requiem clearly picks up exactly where AVP left off, taking place in what appears to either be the same day as AVP, or a day later at worst, yet AVP is set in 2004, since that's 100 years after 1904, while Requiem, is set a whole year later. I just enjoy seeing all these holes, in an installment that is part of a franchise/series that's really all just blotches, being sewn together into a patch blanket held together by well, tape.I can only imagine how terrible an experience it must've been watching this movie in a cinema, since over half of it is set in the dead of night, and not only that, but also, The Brothers Strause and/or Shane Salerno saw it fit to make an already badly lit setting, be further darkened, annoyingly so, than it already was by causing a citywide power outage. The sense in that, is about as logical as, a shot in the dark.However, in the interest of fairness, perhaps the angle The Brothers Strause were going with was, since these two foreign organisms are now fighting above ground, them causing explosions at a power plant draws absolutely no attention to them, at least for that while longer. But, it's still stupid.Also, these Predators have thermal vision, so how is it that they missed the alien inside the predator at the end of AVP? This is more of a Requiem issue than AVP, because Requiem bases its entire plot, or lack thereof, around that outcome.Look, what I'm trying to say is, this movie sucks, it's the worst of the bunch, terribly uninspired and so forgettable, you forget it with every passing scene. Creating the two possible outcomes, with one team going one way, and the other, going another, is the most ""artistic"" part of this film. 3.4/10.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

133,swedzin,"Well, just what the title says...",3,19 August 2016,"It seems that the title is consistent, it seems that we got what we wanted. But, is it good? Well, not that much. We simply got what was written in the title and that's it. The only consistent part is the movie title. The movie starts from the ending of AVP (2004), so we can easily call this film ""AVP 2"". A Pred-Alien somehow grows pretty fast and kills every predator on board and the spacecraft crashed somewhere in the woods of Colorado. Not only that Pred-Alien survived the crash, but also a few facehuggers. So, alarm is triggered at predator's home planet. Yeah, this is the first film where the Predator home world is shown. However, I don't like it personally. Because it looks like some kind of Aztec architecture... it looks human-made. I mean, come on, why not make it look a bit more 'extra-terrestrial'? I expected some kind of rain forest planet, with specific type of architecture and with some kind of retro technology around. So, a special kind of predator, a 'cleaner predator' so to say, flies away to earth to clean the mess behind other predators and to find other xenomorph threats. After many incidents, the residents are gathering to survive.So, basically, we got this nothing special film. Where all attention was pointed to our title characters and their looks. So, why human character? They were just pointless and waste of time and money. They were dull, predictable and undeveloped. They perfectly fit the profile of slasher killer victims. They were just a bags of meat to develop the further actions and final battle between two title characters. Aliens are looking good, Predator also looks good, as more dangerous and more special kind of Predator. Make up department and costume department did a great job with both of them and I give a respect to Tom Woodruff Jr. and his team of practical special effects and puppets and also I am grateful for lack of CGI, and of course I think that Ian Whyte is not bad in the role of Predator. Soundtrack is solid, editing is generic, sound effects are decent. The place chosen for the final conflict is, well kind of unusal. A little bit of woods, a little bit of sewers, and a little bit of pool and hospital. There is one problem actually. At least 75% of action is shot in dark. Why? Is that for intensity? Or mystery? I don't get it. Was it filmed like that only to hide their alien puppets and not to see details on predator costume more clearly? Why? As I said before I think that predator costume and alien puppets are good. Even stuntmen in alien costumes were good. Why not showing that in a bit more brighter light? The actors... well they weren't that special in their performances and I think that the director didn't even want them to act accordingly. There were simply not enough emotions between them. The story development? Only for title characters.Overall, this movie is pretty bad, but no the worst ever. It just gave you what was promised in the title. And that's just it. It has some solid fun, and that's the only reason why should you watch it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
134,kevinxirau,By far the worst in the franchise.,4,24 September 2011,"Two of the galaxy's most bloodthirsty creatures are back, this time having a change of scenery from Antarctica to a small American town and bringing in a new menace that proves to be more deadly than both species. This is AVPR.Taking place right after the end of the previous film, a deadly juvenile Predalien queen has sprung from the corpse of the predator Scar (from AVP) and has snuck aboard a smaller ship heading back to Earth. She quickly, and easily, kills the crew members and causes the ship to crash near a town in Colorado. The creature soon begins spawning countless offspring that start invading the town, so a lone Wolf Predator is sent in to eradicate the infestation, with, of course, humanity caught in the crossfire.Having thoroughly enjoyed the first movie, I was excited when this one came out and had high hopes for it. Needless to say, I wish it was better. There are a few good elements. Seeing the Predator have all new toys to play with like the razor whip and the ""power glove"" is awesome and his nemesis, the Predalien, is a terrifying monster that actually gives the hunter a run for his money and so does her offspring. The effects used to bring them to life are admittedly done well.Two rippling flaws bring this film down. First there's the human cast, who are unlikable and boring, especially compared to the humans in the first film who were more charismatic. I could care less what happens to them. They might as well be cardboard cutouts. Second, the movie was literally too dark; you can hardly see a thing unless you either look closely or repeat the scenes. There's hiding the flaws in the effects and making a creepy atmosphere using darkness and then there's having so little light it's literally unwatchable. Had the filmmakers done better with these elements, AVPR probably would have been more successful.In then end, this is a disgrace to the Alien/Predator franchise. Skip this one.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
135,Mr_Censored,Guilty Pleasure,5,23 March 2010,"Proving that an R-rating doesn't necessarily ensure quality, ""Aliens Vs. Predator - Requiem"" -- the follow-up to Paul W.S. Anderson's original botch-job -- finds the reigns of the franchise being passed to a couple of music-video directors with restored violence that takes the place of innovation, decent story-telling, tension or sheer terror. In the film, an alien spacecraft carrying not only an assortment of facehugger Aliens, but also a new breed of Predator/Alien dubbed the Predalien, crash lands in a small town to wreak havoc on a cast of cardboard cut-outs and stereotypes. Through the 90 minute or so running time, we are treated to nothing much outside of watching the creatures lay waste to their surroundings.While there is certainly a sect of fans who will, at the very least, come to appreciate the minimal thrills the film has to offer, it's certainly an insult to the intelligence of anyone who remembers just how good the source material was to deliver something so apparently inferior. The Brothers Strause certainly have a good sense of style, as evidenced by their music video work, and when director of photography Daniel Pearl isn't doing his best to immerse the picture in complete blackness, the film at least looks good. The directors appear to have love and affection for the franchises they are building off of, but the script doesn't seem to understand what made either film great in the first place, amounting to a b-grade sci-fi monster mash-up that marks a low point in the 30+ year history it draws from.With bad characters, bad dialog and nothing to justify its existence outside of sheer goriness and impressive creature design, ""Aliens Vs. Predator - Requiem"" is pure guilty pleasure material. Thankfully, it doesn't take up too much of your time and if you're lucky, you'll milk some cheap thrills out of it. If, however, you're expecting something of the same caliber as the original ""Alien,"" ""Aliens"" or even ""Predator,"" you'll be left in the cold.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

AVPR - Aliens vs. Predator Requiem is OK to be watched once but gets worse the more times you see it. I quite liked it when the first time I seen it but I didn't the second time and I don't know what went wrong. I seen the first AVP many times and I'm still not fed up because it had a decent story and an aim but AVPR didn't. The main reason why it turned out to be bad is that Paul W.S. Anderson did not direct it.The lighting effects are horrible and you can't figure out what's going on. The budget is low but they don't need a lot of money for a few light bulbs. I think that they tried to make it as dark as possible which was stupid because that is just like watching your TV switched off. There was no sign of the Alien Queen and they should of shown something about her. The only good move is the Predalien Hybrid and that was basically it. Overall this movie is a piece of tissue paper which is a once use and throw e.g. It is OK to be watched once but not again, so AVPR isn't a good movie.

Now two new directors take over and it becomes a R rated movie which make fans excited to watch the movie. Well, this is more violent than the first one. But both have simple story. Aliens running and killing people, Predators killing and humans running unsuccessfully. In AVP 2, there is a short introduction on the humans, the aliens and the predator. Then from there, you will expect non-stop action and gore. It does have its moments when predator is fighting with aliens and that is all.There is nothing to comment on the story plot. It is simple. The point here is the violence and the gore which fans want. There is some gore, non-stop action and a hot chick in her bra and underwear. What more do action fans want? All that sums to a mindless action flick. If you want a movie which has no plot but just the action, this one is suit it. It is not that bad. Enough to thrill me with its non-stop action but I though the introduction on the humans is a bit not necessary, it will only slow down the pace of it. The introduction on the aliens and the predator is okay. After all, this is mindless action flick that might entertain people.Overall: If you hate to watch the plot unfolding, this is one you should watch- you don't even have to know about the plot, you just watch the action. As the usual surviving action flick, there is nothing different than the first AVP except the gore. I did not watch for the gore or the hot chick, I just watch for entertainment as I was bored.

The criticisms: that it's filmed too dark, that the plot is kind of teen slasher-y, and that it's over the top with disturbing imagery, are all perfectly valid. But it's also kind of fun to watch the town get literally and figuratively swallowed by the violence in such an over-the-top way.The thing to know going in to this film is that the usual rules of horror movies that protect children and cute pets are completely tossed out the window here. The director clearly wanted to make a movie where almost anyone could become the next victim, and they accomplish that fairly well.Because the violence is so outlandish it detracts from the horror of the body count imo, making it a fun movie to watch with friends while you cheer for your favorite team. Which is pretty much why I like it, but make no mistake: you should not let younger children anywhere near this movie or you will give them nightmares for weeks. And, of course, anyone that is squeamish about seeing buckets of ketchup sprayed everywhere should probably avoid it as well.So the movie isn't very ""realistic"", even by the rules of the AVP universe, and the story is less clever than shocking, but personally I think that it can be fun if viewed with the right mindset. 5/10",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

The joke that AVP turned out to be was a disgrace to the franchise. The Predator character was terribly short-changed, and the PG-13 rating hurt the movie beyond repair. With AVP-R we get a return to form of sorts, the Predator character is revived and is the highlight of the movie. This movie is just RAW; straight to the point, no sugar coating; you have the Aliens, you have the Predator, and they go at it. The body count is high, and the encounter between the two 'monsters' is satisfying.Sure there are many plot holes in this movie, and the human actors aren't very good; but I didn't come into this to see them....I came to see the Aliens and the Predator battle, and I got what I wanted. The Predator was true to form with some new tricks up its sleeve, and it was enjoyable.Everything just sort of happens here, and then the credits roll. Some parts were silly; for instance it was asinine to see a Predator use his shoulder cannon in their own ship the way it did....they come off smarter than that. The human actors were your basic run-of-the-mill characters, just about what I expected. It was painfully obvious that they were only there as game for when the 'monsters' arrived. A child was even subject to the fate of the aliens, which I thought was a cool change of pace. I wanted to see more of the 'Pred-Alien' and its abilities, but he was still pretty cool; the hospital scene was intense. AVP-R also pays homage to the past films in a few of the scenes; from quotes to the actions of the creatures; that brought a smile to my face, as I'm a big fan of Predator. At the end of the day, the Predator is king, to say it simply....he was the sh*t!! As long as you go into AVP-R knowing what you're going to get, and if you're a fan of the Predator franchise especially; I think you'll enjoy this. I did.8/10",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

How hard is it to make an AVP film, at least look to the comics, but NO we get generic trash 101. The aliens were more like serial killers, this film is more like a slasher film than a alien film. The characters and acting were and still are horrible. Well it's gotta have good gore right, wrong if there was any I missed it in all the darkness. This movie is unbelievably dark, a lot of the time you can't even see the aliens or even tell whats happening. This movie is garbage in every shape and form. But if you want to see aliens and predators fight, you will be pleased. The action/fight scenes were good even if they were short. When I pop the DVD in, I only do so to watch the fight scenes. The directors obviously don't know how to make a movie, which brings me to this point, why couldn't they hire someone good instead of them.

A Predator heads out to find the craft, while the Alien creatures begin to cause death and destruction in a small town in America....The first Alien/Predator cross-over movie wasn't bad, but a missed opportunity. This sequel again is a missed opportunity.Starting with what is wrong....The cast aren't great. Some of the performances are so poor, you'd think the cast hadn't acted before. Of course it doesn't help that the script is poor, but it's made worse by the direction.Directed by The Brothers Strause, the movie comes over as trying to give fans of both movie series everything they want, BUT the problem is that to make that work, you have to have characters you actually care about. Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, Predator 2 (I prefer it) had these. This movie has a young cast better suited to a slasher movie.And as for the final scene? Don't get me started. It feels tagged on to try and tie up with the original Alien movie, which it doesn't if you think about it.But there are some good things here too.The movie has put back the blood and violence sorely lacking from the first movie. There are some brutal deaths for characters, culminating in a brutal, nasty sequence in a hospital. Some people might be offended by this scene, but I think it works well. It does spring surprises in who lives and dies. There were a couple of surprises in this regard.Some of the action scenes are well done. A fight in a sewer being one of the best, as the Predator unleashes some previously unseen weapons. You get the feeling the directors were more interested in the action and effects than the script and cast, and to be fair they handle this well.This is not a movie that can sit beside the classics in the Alien/ Predator franchises.

146,dmuel,How disappointing!,4,1 March 2008,"In this, the latest installment of two once proud film franchises, the Predator and Alien seriesof late known as Alien v Predatorthe plot, what there is of it, has a Predator out to avenge the death of one of his own at the hands of an new breed of Alien. This brings the adversaries together in small-town USA, somewhere in Colorado. The human characters in this film include the town Sheriff, a young man and woman involved in a romantic triangle, and a young woman returning from military service to see her husband and daughter, among others. Unfortunately, this film was written in B movie style, and the characters are all conventional B movie characters. This is really sad because the movie could have been so much better with good writing. While there are one or two novelties in this flick, mostly it is a rehash of several elements, even some scenes, from many of the previous Alien/ Predator moviessome lifted with seemingly no sense of shame or embarrassment over the lack of originality. No strong effort is made to allow the viewer to relate to any of the hapless humans in the film, as is typical in B movie fare, and consequently we are merely subjected to Alien/ Predator gore. None of the actors in the film is worth noting, and they will likely show up in the Sci-Fi channel's next movie of the week.

You wonder if this scenario took place before or after the first two Predator Film scenarios and the swift and drastic action taken by USA executive government gives you a clue. Then I wonder that the first Alien series that appear to set in a future time to this episode would not have already known about the Alien species and how to deal with them or maybe they did I leave that to fans of this series.I think the new species the cross between the alien and predator and the in the face confrontations are great. The whole impregnation process of the Aliens who every subliminally orally sexual and reaches new levels in this one.It is such a pity that the producers along with Murdoch's Fox pictures didn't allow the budget for the use of quality Deep vision film and instead the film is shot with ultra cheap Agfa vision film which gives it the washy orange and blue tint. It was this ultra cheap and tacky film process that was used for ""Lord of the Rings"" and many other ""no frills"" films but your average punter wouldn't know the difference unless its pointed out.I firmly believe that this and many other films should use your standard Kodak deep vision with full genuine colour and great lenses with Panavision and Arriflex cameras as most films do these days.Still it was very entertaining and there was lots of mass destruction.

The story is straight forward. They stole it from about 2 million ""B"" zombie flicks. They changed the zombies to aliens and predators. Lame. The creature effects and gore are too dark and you find you are squinting to see anything. What a waste. Production values are good for what I could see. The predator and alien look good for what I could see. The acting is OK. The story blows.Spoiler I really thought the killing of a hospital full of babies was not necessary and drew me out of what little drawing it it had done(same with the killing of the little boy near the beginning really).When are they going to do this right? This is not a complete waste of time but barely worth watching.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
152,thefan-2,Insulting,1,25 May 2008,"Starring actors you've never heard of, and taking place entirely at night and in sewers and other dark venues (the predator actually cuts the power to the town at one point to insure the movie makers won't have to spend any money on sets and effects), with cretinous dialog, no plot whatsoever, and characters whose deaths you greet with a shrug and a yawn, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. It is the disgraceful bottoming out of two great franchises, and I spent $4.99 on pay-per-view to see it. Go ahead, laugh, I deserve it.There is nothing more to say about this horrible movie, but IMDb won't let me enter my review until I've used up ten lines, so here goes: Don't see this movie, don't rent it, and for heaven's sake don't see any movie ever made or that ever will be made by the schmendricks who are responsible for it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

It's a real embarrassment.I did not expect something THIS poor from such a massively popular franchise. Well, sequels often tend to be worse than the original, but this is not ""worse"" -- this is ""unwatchable"".It should've been released as a stand-alone movie. Except, in that case, nobody would be interested in seeing this rubbish. They basically just stuck the ""AvP"" label on it -- to trick people into seeing this godawful excuse for a movie.I was insulted by this nondescript drivel.It's clichéd to the point of vomit and UNBELIEVABLY predictable. What a borefest. It's some kind of awfully pieced together, half-a***ed, small-budget, generic pseudo-horror, aimed at dumb teenagers.Everything - absolutely everything - about this movie SUCKS. The plot is ridiculous and utterly predictable -- you know EXACTLY what (and when... and where...) is going to happen, there's ZERO suspense, the dialogue is laughably pathetic, the camera-work is annoying, and the actors are lame and unconvincing -- a bunch of useless amateurs. There really isn't ANYTHING good to say about this pathetic failure.God, why on earth would they release something THIS bad?",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

So, yes this one has more gore and action than the 1st BUT....who the heck thought that it was a good idea to screen most of the movie in the dark with added rain?
Sure, that saves a lot of money. And it kills an even larger part of suspence and horror (horror/gore you hardly see isn't real horror/gore).Now add that they missed a few key elements of Alien:
a) Acid for blood
Only if it suits the directors did that have any impact....otherwise they kill Aliens left and right with tremendous green blood....and nothing happens to the environment or the actors standing next to an Alien.
b) Time.....the Aliens impregnate their victims....in a few minutes the new brood
hatches....and from little Alien baby to full monster Alien there is even less time needed.From the many Alien spin offs for me this is the worst one.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
155,tom_koopa,Going downhill...,5,1 May 2009,"After Alien versus Predator, I was hoping they would make a better sequel and perhaps listen to the complaints of the fans made on the first movie.But, as it turned out, this movie was only worse.It still has most elements from both series, it still has tension (although not as good as in the prequels), still blood, gore and a LOT of deaths.I can't help but think that this movie was a forced sequel. It shows on several aspects...This movie is still too dark! I honestly thought at times that the settings of my TV were not correct, because sometimes I could barely see what was going on. About half-way, I gave up and cranked up the brightness of my TV. I NEVER had to do that with any movie. I don't know what they were thinking, but even in a thriller/horror movie it helps to see what is going on, even if it is obvious.This is also the first time a kid is the victim of the dreaded facehugger. I wonder how they got away with that. I thought it was a Hollywood 'rule' that children don't die in horror movies. Maybe I'm old fashioned...They really went over-the-top with the gore in this movie. I've watched all the Alien movies, both predator movies AND AvP and I still found the gore in this movie a little too much at times. There's one scene in particular that I found very... disturbing. I won't go into detail, but once the movie moves to a hospital, be prepared for some nasty stuff.Okay, the effects are well done and yes the aliens and predators look awesome. But it doesn't save the movie.Predalien? We already know that aliens mimic features from the host body they emerge from. But... predalien? That's fanfic material right there if you ask me. I wasn't really impressed by the hybrid. Just give me the original Alien and Predator creatures instead. Actors, if you can call them that, were woody in this film. I honestly thought that sometimes they literally read their text on a cue sign! Not that there is much text in this movie anyway...The ending makes you believe that yet ANOTHER sequel is going to be made someday. I really hope that if they do, they will listen to the fans and make it an enjoyable ride.Watch this movie only if you are a die-hard fan of the Alien and/or Predator series.

It is a science fiction movie and you aren't supposed to take it that seriously. Its meant to be a popcorn movie and thats exactly what it delivers. Not much depth but a hell of a good time. I guess some religious folk got upset about some things that happened in the movie or something, but they forgot it is not supposed to be taken seriously.This is a movie I would want to purchase for my collection, that is how much I liked it.

157,Craig_McPherson,Tasty Interstellar Cheese - not too ripe,5,25 December 2007,"There's a reason why B horror movies such as 1964's Two Thousand Maniacs have garnered a cult following today in spite of their numerous obvious flaws  they're fun in a campy, you can see the kills coming from a mile away, manner.It's this factor that single handedly redeems Alien vs Predator: Requiem (AVPR) from the cinematic trash heap. In spite of all its problems (and there are many), it delivers spectacularly in full chest bursting glory.Picking up where the original AVP left off, a Yautja (Predator), impregnated by a Xenomorph (Alien), yields it's DNA cloning parasite while en-route to the Yautja home world from Earth. The result is the advent of a Xenomorph queen with the added strength, dexterity and select physical attributes of its Yautja host.Things quickly turn bloody aboard the ship, which subsequently crashes in the wilderness surrounding a remote Colorado town, setting free the queen, along with countless Xenomorph ""face huggers"".From this point on everything's a mere countdown to all hell breaking loose as the unleashed critters set about propagating themselves at a blistering rate.For reasons unexplained, a single bad-ass Yautja is dispatched across the interstellar void to clean up the mess, leaving me to conclude that these guys are either (a) unparalleled killing machines, (b) incredibly stupid, or (c) that the producers had only enough money for one suit of each alien species.Populated with cookie cutter human characters and ham handed, blatantly telegraphed script gimmicks that appear to have been penned by Mongo from Blazing Saddles (witness the scene when a Marine mother returning from service in Iraq brings her daughter not an Elmo or Barbie, but a set of night vision goggles  I kid you not  and you just know those goggles are going to come into play later in the story) AVPR practically begs to be laughed at. And yet, in spite of all its flaws, I couldn't help but come away having spent a fun filled 90 minutes of extra-terrestrial kick ass action because when hiss comes to shove, AVPR knows what the audience wants to see, and delivers.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

The fact David Giler gave this a greenlight is also staggering. If Alien and Aliens were the highpoint of the saga, this is a subterranean embarrassment.

Every human character in the movie is so annoying that you find yourself wishing the Aliens would just kill all of them immediately. Luckily, they do kill most of them pretty quick.Too much Earth, too much teen angst, too much with the child actors. Too much trying to ape all the other movies before it. There's even a Ripley-like military woman and her kid.The dark lighting, or should I say, non-lighting is like trying to watch Doom3 as a movie, only worse. You can't see much of what's going on in all the parts of the movie that should be good. Forget about getting a good look at the Predator, the Aliens, or the PredaAlien. It was deliberately filmed very dark so you can't see much.And you can forget about seeing much Predator scenes, he has a few, but not many. There are quite a few face hugger scenes, burster scenes. Nothing we haven't seen before, except they do some really gross things with pregnant women in this movie.Pretty much, everything is wrong with this film. The script is boring, draggy and sux. It's a Saturday SciFi Channel movie. If you love those awful SciFi Saturday features, this one will surely show up there in about six months or so.I would have to say the script writer and the director must surely be watching too much SciFi Saturday. This movie is almost FrankenFish bad.Is there any hope left for this franchise? Why is it so hard for them to make a descent AvP movie?

163,Punk19,An Okay Film,7,29 April 2008,"Alien vs Predator (2004) ended with Scar (Ian Whyte), one of the three Predators in that film, dead and lying on a bed in a ship, that is where Aliens vs Pedator Requirem (2007) picks up. Buddy Benson (Kurt Max Runte) and his son Sam (Liam James) are out hunting (before then the Predalien bursted from Scars chest, grew up and attacked the Predators on the ship causing it to crash) when they see an alien craft crash into the Earth, (a few hundred yards, when actually it hits a mountain, then crashes down , looks like some miles) the man and boy get to it in a few minutes but are spooked away by the face huggers. Both the man and the boy get face hugged minutes later.Meanwhile, in Gunnison, Colorado, Dallas Howard (Steven Pasquale) arrives back just released from prison. He meets old time friend, and the town sheriff Eddie Morales (John Ortiz) and reunites with his brother Ricky (Johnny Lewis). Kelly O'Brien (Reiko Aylesworth) has just returned to Gunnison following a town of duty in the military, she reunites with her husband Tim (Sam Trammell) and daughter Molly O'Brien (Ariel Gade). The Predator, nicknamed Wolf (Ian Whyte), scouts the fallen ship, takes a few gadgets from a few of the dead Predators, surveys the damage then blows the ship up so that there won't be any evidence left. Darcy Benson (Chelah Horsdal) begins searching for her husband and a cop goes missing (killed by the Predator).All of the Aliens, and the Predalien (hybrid between Predator and Alien) relocate to the sewer until the Predator drives them out and into the streets (including a gruesome fight in a hospital). Several people are killed: Jesse (Kristen Hager), her ex boyfriend Dale Collins (David Paetkau) and two other guys and the National Guard. At the Gun Store, the Predator makes one of his shoulder cannons (both are damaged) into a hand-held gun.Kelly drives a helicopter to safety (the helicopter crashes into a clearing were they are confronted and the blaster cannon is confiscated). The film ends with the Predator fighting the Predalien, and a nuclear bomb kills everyone in the town (Except Molly, Kelly, Ricky, Dallas) including the aliens, the Predator and the Predalien. The blaster cannon is given to Ms. Yutani (foreshadowing the Weyland-Yutani Coorporation of the Alien series).I give this film a 7.5 out of 10, for the gore and violence, the film was way to dark! You could barely see anything, much less what was going on, I did like the scene where it showed the Predator world though.

The reason why this movie is so good is that there is lots of action in it. The storyline is good. The actors are not so bad but they are not the best actors in the world. The way they did the aliens and predators are really good but the aliens look different in this one but they still look really good. The actors that played the aliens and predator did it really good and they should play them again if there are future sequels.

166,MetalGeek,"Monster Mash, Round Two",5,9 October 2008,"After watching ""Alien Vs. Predator: Requiem"" and then reading through the comments about it on this site, I am quite frankly amazed at the amount of outright hatred that exists for this movie. I mean, come on, were you people expecting Shakespeare from a sequel to a film that was universally panned by the ""AvP"" fanboy community last time around? I personally found the original film entertaining enough in a B-Movie sort of way, but the many liberties it took with both Alien and Predator mythology (not to mention the PG-13 rating it was saddled with) definitely lessened its impact. I'll admit it, I was simply glad to finally see these two critters clash on the big screen, as I'd been a fan of the original Dark Horse comic book series that started the whole ball rolling nearly twenty years ago now. Moving on to ""Alien Vs. Predator: Requiem,"" anyone who complained about the lack of gore in the first film should be totally satisfied by this entry, as it's almost wall-to-wall blood, guts, and alien goop from the first frame. The Predator/Alien hybrid creature that was introduced at the end of the first film causes havoc upon the crew of the Predator ship as it leaves Earth orbit, causing it to crash-land back on our planet near a small Colorado town. The ""Predalien"" escapes into the woods (accompanied by seemingly zillions of ""facehuggers"") and when word gets back to the Predator homeworld of the accident, a lone ""cleaner"" Predator is dispatched to take care of the problem. As soon as he lands in Colorado, ""it's ON"" as they say. The human characters in ""AvP:R"" are basically here to provide cannon fodder or Alien chow, none of them are very interesting. There's a nerdy pizza delivery boy and his ex-con brother, a hot high school chick, a U.S. military woman just back (presumably) from the Middle East and her young daughter, the Sheriff, and a few other assorted ""small town horror film"" stock characters. Once a few of them get face-hugged and start sprouting Aliens left and right, the movie basically turns into a gory video game. Aliens crash through people's windows, pop up behind unsuspecting diner cooks, and overrun the local hospital (the scene set in the maternity ward there is just wrong, Wrong, WRONG, by the way), while our overwhelmed lone Predator hero kicks as much Alien ass as he can and the few surviving humans simply try to get the hell out of town. Eventually the military is called in and I will not betray the SPOILER WARNING rules by telling you how it all turns out, except to say that similar methods were employed in the original ""Return of the Living Dead."" On a B-Movie level, ""AvP:R"" satisfied me for most of its run time, with only a few minor quibbles. My main complaint is that many of the outdoor night-time scenes were so dark that it was hard to tell what the hell was going on. (The final battle between the Predator and the ""Predalien"" Queen was VERY unsatisfying for this reason.) I am not quite sure if I prefer it to the first film but as long as you don't go into ""AvP: R"" expecting a masterpiece, it's a decent enough way to kill two hours.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

When I read people writing its an awesome movie if you want that kind of thing, B-movie style aliens and predator battling it out, I still have to disagree.The filmmakers were totally incapable of removing themselves from the film. Rather than giving you something you can just lose yourself in and enjoy, its completely self-conscious. Even the editing, from the opening shots of the CGI ship, is totally cold. Its the visual equivalent of listening to an enthusiastic but stupid student talking about their 'way cool' idea for an AVP movie. All of this just removed me completely from the film, I could only look 'at' it rather than following anything 'in' the film.B-movies can be warm and lovable (e.g. Slither, The Hidden) but this seemed to think it was so 'awesome, man!' that it was anything but.Such a shame.

168,dirtychild,Don't say I didn't warn you that this movie stinks!,3,4 January 2008,"Well after the first AVP movie - I wasn't holding out much hope for this one - and funnily enough - this one too is pretty much fairly on the garbage side.The plot (or perhaps the dodgy story that tries to tie the Aliens and Predators on earth again) goes something like a ship with Predators crash lands on earth after a couple of face huggers / aliens escaped. The movie gets rather bogged down in a bunch of stereotypical characters - none of which the audience would have any sympathy for. These characters includes a few OC/Dawson Creek teens who are having a few relationship problems, a Iraqi War vet (cue dodgy patriotism), some ex-con and a police chief (or something) - but I can't remember the rest because they were so paper thin and boring - I couldn't wait for them to all meet horrible deaths.The only thing this film has over the first AVP is that the Predators are quite nasty to humans (unlike the first one where they befriend the heroine and sing Koombiyah). It adds to the menace of the Predator - and makes them a bit more interesting than their alien counterpart.This film is pretty much garbage - the plot, the unlikeable characters, the really un-scary death scenes (I wish I had a dollar every time an alien popped out from behind someone...). I hate to say this - but I wish they stop making Alien movies because the first two are just so great - and these films just pale in comparison.Don't say I didn't warn you that this is a garbage movie!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

170,fearfulofspiders,"Better Than the 2004 Release, But Still Terrible...",4,22 September 2008,"After seeing the first Alien vs. Predator back in 2004, I pretty much lost all faith in the franchise. While the only good thing to come of the wretched film was McFarlane's figurines, there was little, if any, enthusiasm left for such a dwindling series of films. Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem is far more faithful to its origins, but where the originality, terror, and (of all things) plot seemed to be absent.About 80% of this film is nothing but Aliens versing a single Predator; Aliens harvesting across the town; or our hero Predator just walking around doing things we cannot comprehend, or are not clearly stated. While the Paul W.S. Anderson film did not live up to the title of AVP, Requiem surpasses the title, giving us too much of a good thing. The pacing is ridiculous, as there's hardly any breathing room between people getting their skulls punctured by little-mouths or cuddled by face-huggers. There is no tension or buildup to seeing these creatures, which is where the Alien and Predator franchise tend to succeed in very well. Even for a horror film, there's not even subtle complexity, nor detailed character development, as the writers believe cliché romance and school bullying actually works as a subplot... well, it doesn't.The acting, for all it's worth, is not very good. It's a lot of screaming, running, and ""I'm not leaving without him!"" In fact, there is NOT ONE character worth rooting for, because by the final 45-minutes of the film, I was actually rooting for the Predator to just nuke them all just so it would end. None of the characters made sense, none of them were ones the audience could relate to, and all of them were very, very whiny.The special effects and creature design are pretty cool. Far more interesting than the first AVP, this sequel has plenty of both alien species, though the flaw that must be pointed out is: 85%, if not more, of this movie takes place in the dark. That is where the first AVP failed, and just like it, Requiem tumbles along with it, as you can hardly tell what the hell these creatures are doing. The editing of the climactic fight is poor, and there's no ""umph"" we feel for whichever side we are rooting for (Predators or Aliens). The Strause Brothers have a good vision, and some of the settings seemed surreal, however, their eye for story and pacing is no where to be seen.Brian Tyler's music is terrible. There's moments that hearken back to the first Predator and first Alien films, but the rest is complete, nonsensical bombast. There is nothing worth liking in this score, and it is just way too loud and messy to consider buying.All in all, Alien vs. Predator - Requiem was far more enjoyable than Paul W.S. Anderson's film (then again, every film is better than that one) even with a lot of serious flaws, I recommend this to anyone who's had a stressful day at school or work and is looking for mindless entertainment to relieve themselves of stress.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

173,simonparker1990,Vast improvement on its predecessor,6,18 January 2008,"As a devout Alien fan and a fairly enthusiastic Predator fan I was very disappointed by the first Alien Vs Predator. Paul W.S. Anderson is a talentless director and whoever let him sign on for the movie deserves to be shot. Its a shame that movie was poor, as the Alien franchise is amazing. Alien is a masterpiece, Aliens even more so, Alien 3 is highly underrated, and Alien Resurrection, okay that was a bad movie. The Predator movies are also very good films, the first being a classic and its sequel being an entertaining flick. So I did go into AVP2 with a bit of apprehension. While the movie is not perfect at all it is also a vast improvement on its predecessor. In fact its by no means the worst of the series and probably just about equals Predator 2 in quality terms. AVP2 is dumb fun in its purest sense. The acting isn't magnificent, the plot isn't vitally important, but the film delivers cool action, good old fashioned fun and a nice ending for fans of the Alien franchise. The monsters are also treated a bit more respectably, at least the chest burster this time was done in the right way, and the Predator seemed a lot cooler in this movie as well. Unfortunately the movie does have some hefty flaws, the script is pretty naff at times and the movie is just too short for its own good.So let me start on the acting of the film. The lead man of the movie, Dallas played by Steven Pasquale, is just terrible, he really is. I never saw the point in the character and I hated any moment he was on screen. His brother, played by Johnny Lewis is much better, unfortunately though his importance as a character is completely shunned aside come the final twenty minutes. Reiko Aylesworth is by far the best person in the movie, she pretty much is on hand to be the Ripley replacement, which she does decently if not spectacularly. Unfortunately she has to deliver my most hated line in the movie which makes me cringe just thinking about, I won't spoil it but let me just say it turned up in the film Aliens, why she had to say it just makes me angry. The rest of the cast are essentially prop placements, there to be killed by aliens and the pred-alien. I suppose the big cast members are the predator and aliens, oh and the pred-alien. The predator in this movie, one named Wolf, is really brilliant. He has great weapons in this film and some great moments in the film. Unlike the last movie I found the predator cooler than the aliens.. The aliens in this film are unfortunately cannon fodder, don't get me wrong they have some great moments, and whenever one is on screen you can't help but feel a chill of excitement, but there are too many of them this time around and way too many of them die too quickly. The pred-alien on the other hand is something I am still not 100% sure about. Once you get over how silly it looks it is a pretty decent creation, and it is nowhere near as embarrassing as the Newborn from Alien Resurrection, but I just kept thinking it was an unnecessary plot point.So let me move onto the important thing about the movie, that most namely being the action scenes. AVP was a let-down in terms of action, the predators and aliens met barely at all and when they did they didn't really fight much. Also any encounter with the aliens or predators just seemed rushed. Here the action works so much better, most namely because the gore has been amped up quite a bit. At least this time the chest burster has blood when it comes out, in fact there are quite a few chest bursters this time around. Anyway when the predator and aliens meet the fights are superb. The first fight in a sewer involving a new weapon from the predator is amazing, and the fights towards the end are so thrilling to watch. A slight moan however is that the action is lit way too poorly, so at times it is difficult to make out what is going on. Also I have mixed feelings about a maternity ward sequence, I just can't make up my mind if it was a great scene are a very sick scene. Anyway these aren't the faults of the film, the faults of the film have to be the script and the occasional plot hole. But to be honest if you went to see this film expecting a quality script then you have been cruelly misguided anyway. Despite its many flaws you leave AVP2 feeling pretty satisfied and happier than you did when you saw the first movie. Oh and the ending really made me very happy, if you are not an Alien fan you won't understand the ending, and its clearly been put there for the fans, but if you do know your Alien history you will be a very happy person and will get what it means.AVP2 isn't a masterpiece, I never expected it to be an amazing film. But it is a mildly diverting one that is a boost up from the last few movies in the series. The Brothers Strauss are better than Anderson ever was and the action scenes delivered are pretty exciting. Do I want a third movie? I'm still unsure, I'd much rather have an Alien 5 or a Predator 3 to be honest, but this movie at least should keep people entertained for a little while.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

175,TheSeaLion,"Lacking in anything that makes ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" good",1,21 January 2014,"The aliens of the ""Alien"" franchise and the predators of the ""Predator"" franchise are two of the most famous and iconic movie monsters to ever be created. Both creatures have left their mark on pop culture and are some of the most terrifying creations of Hollywood. Putting them together in a movie seems like a brilliant idea for a crossover film. The problem? It goes against everything that made these two creatures great in the first place.The film starts out with a spaceship containing the aliens and predators crashing in the middle of a forest on earth. All but one Predator is killed while the alien face-huggers escape and attack a father and his son, implanting embryos in them which will soon hatch. The creatures burst from their chests and head into the town to cause chaos. In town, a thousand characters are thrown into the story, all with no personality that are just there to be cannon fodder. Among the many characters are brothers Dallas (Steven Pasquale) and Ricky (the late Johnny Lewis), a mother who has just returned from the armed services named Kelly (Reiko Aylesworth) and her daughter Molly (Ariel Gade), Sheriff Eddie Morales (John Ortiz), and the girl Ricky has a crush on named Jesse (Kristen Hager). The film spends its first forty minutes setting up uninteresting characters, most of which to be killed off, and some are given story arcs that are never completed or just disappear, such as the romance between Ricky and Jesse. After the creatures start attacking, more and more characters show up at different times just to be killed off a few minutes later just so there can be a big body count. The movie is more interested in having characters get blasted by the predator and eaten by the aliens than creating characters that we can route for.The largest problem in the film, however, is not the characters, though they are a big problem, but the creatures. In the original movies, the creatures were kept hidden from the audience at first so we could use our imaginations run loose and imagine what they looked like, making them more terrifying. In this, they are shown within the first ten minutes and then are hidden from us because of how dark they make it in the film.""Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem"" is, in simplest form, terrible. It lacks what made the creatures so scary and memorable and turned them into comical creatures fighting in the middle of a city where characters we don't care about are getting picked off one by one. Even the first ""Alien vs. Predator"" movie from the year 2004 knew to have it be a small number of characters so we could identify who was who. This movie can not even do that right.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

178,unakaczynski,"Better than the first film, at least.",6,4 June 2008,"SPOILERS MARKED WITH ""***""Brief rundown edited from full review which can be found here: http://www.residenthazard.com/essays_avp-R.htm Here's the breakdown:The Good: --With the last film, I found barely any quality moments which earned a positive point. One of those was the special effects with a disclaimer: The special effects were damn near perfect from the very beginning of either Alien or Predator seriesso they should still be awesome today. And that's true. The effects of the Aliens and Predators are awesome, the designs are fairly standard, though good. And for the most part, even the CG effects are exceptionally well done.--Yes, it earns that ""R"" rating. For one, the first two people infected with aliens are a little kid and his Dad who are out hunting. There is ""adult language,"" plenty of violence and gore. --Heavily borrows the music from previous films (especially Predator), and it still sounds good. --Strong female lead is still no Ripley, but she's much more likable than that awful woman from the previous AvP film. --Stupid, nonsensical plot elements kept to a minimum. For instance, the characters who would be a burden on the heroic characters tend not to last very long. --Human characters are better and typically more likable than in the first AvP film. --Whereas the last movie totally failed to give us the signature shocks and gore of these two franchises, this film does not fail. We see a couple heads explode, inner-mouths of aliens smashing people's heads, chest-bursting surprises, and acid blood burning the hell out of some people. --There is only one real Predator in the film and a plethora of aliens. This actually worked in the benefit of the film because we finally got some expansive story on the Predator species that doesn't go out and contradict some things that we already know. This one lone Predator seems to be playing as a one-man clean-up crew to erase any evidence of either Aliens or Predators on the planet. Rather than having the sometimes ridiculous nature of the previous film where there were just seemingly random shots of Aliens and Predators fighting each other, we had the lone hunter againnot really seen since the first Predator film. This, for me, was probably the most enjoyable part of the film overall. --Queen Predalien actually looks pretty cool. --Much improved horror atmosphere, but somewhat average cinematography overall. --Remember in the previous AvP film where the Predator decided he was going to team up with the ""heroic female lead?"" And he gave her a laughably stupid weapon and ridiculous ""shield"" which was little more than just an alien head? Yeah, nothing quite that stupid going on in this film.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help: --Usually, when a film late in a series pays homage to previous films, it's pretty cool. Here, it felt a little over-obvious. ""Get to the chopper!"" is yelled, the Predator removes his mask in a rather cliché manner (exactly duplicated from the first film), and a couple other moments. --Acting pitches and wanes in quality. It's never perfect, but typically it's pretty good. There are moments where it's just average for a film of this nature ""to carry the story until the movie gets gory."" --Burgeoning love story between two of the main characters is pretty weak. --Follows somewhat typical horror-action film format where we are introduced to a bunch of seemingly random characters who all end up working together for a common goal in the end. Hey, at least the horror elements are back.--Character development is typically pretty lightwhich is par for the course of this type of film. Better than the last film which had next to none. --Predator under-utilizes his cloaking ability. While it makes sense for us moviegoers to see him, logically for his character, I'd have expected him to use it more. --Action hero moments a la the Predator series are still here. --Story picks up right after the dreadful first film. --Occasionally bland or cliché dialog. --The previous film ran at a bare minimum 84 minutesthis one at least fills the time with a more workable story at about an hour and forty minutes.The Bad: -- *** There is some real plot confusion at an unfortunate key moment in the film: The National Guard is called in to help the people in this town, yet, it seems the information on the Aliens creeping around is yet unknown. So, this is to aid a town whose only power station was completely destroyed. Yet they all have guns drawn, and weapons a bit more ""automatic"" and powerful than you'd expect. It almost seems as though the government is aware of the ""infestation,"" but clear links aren't easily made. -- *** A bizarre new development was spawned with this filmand maybe it's intended to be a side-effect of the Queen also being the Predalien, I don't know, but she seems to have cut out the middle man. She moves in to a victim's face, spreads the Predator-like appendages, then plants that inner mouth inside the mouth of a humanand lo and behold, she's playing the role of an instant-face-hugger. While it helped speed the action along, it violates some of the ""known rules"" of Aliens. --Aliens were still born and grown to adulthood a bit too quickly. --Strange occurrence of a large spaceship crashing in the mountains in the US and pretty much no one in the nearby small town hearing it. Perhaps this relates back to the explanation of why the military took such serious noticebut then, this whole part of the film could've used a lot more explanation all around.Final Score: 6/10www.ResidentHazard.com",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

180,Lando_Hass,What a Predator/Alien movie should feel like. Strauss Brothers did an amazing job,10,23 December 2007,"I work at a movie theater, so I had the awesome pleasure of getting to dry run this movie (that's projection lingo for ""watch movie early""). I just saw this, and let me tell you.....it's Bad-Ass, with a capital B and A, if you didn't notice. Let me explain why this sequel is roughly a jillion times better than the first movie...Now, anyone who knows about this movie is already familiar with AvP 1. That was directed by Paul Anderson, a man who's been raping franchises for a while now. The movie was rated PG-13, which should already tell you how good it's gonna be (who rates an Alien/Predator movie PG-*******-13?). Turns out, the movie was complete garbage. It looked good, but it sucked for a few reasons: The Predators weren't BAMFs. Two got killed way early, and the last one standing just didn't take care of business like a bad-ass. He had to team up with a human in order to defeat the aliens. Come on now. Second, it was cheesy as hell (thanks to Paul Anderson). The human characters sucked, and overall, it lacked the feel of a Predator and Alien movie. Last....it was rated PG-13, and had little to no blood. It's Predator and Alien! How could it be PG-13? Long story short, it sucked.Now, we have AvP: Requiem, and Anderson had ZERO to do with it, so that's an early indication it won't be a stinking pile of ass. It was directed by The Brothers Strauss, who directed a whole bunch of cool music videos. These two not only made a movie that looks amazing visually, but they made a movie that felt exactly like a Predator and Alien movie should feel like: Thrilling, bloody, gory, and absolutely HARDCORE. I'm not kidding. Just when you think this movie goes too far, it goes even further, and you're just sitting there, thinking, ""Wow, that's bad-ass."" The one difference everyone will notice is that it's rated R, and for good reason. This movie pulls out no stops when it comes to savage and brutal, bad-ass violence. In the first ten minutes, a guy hunting in the forest with his 8 year old boy gets his arm melted off, and he and his son get impregnated by a couple of face-huggers. A few minutes later, they both come to, and guess what? Both their chests burst in bloody goodness. The movie sets the tone within the first ten minutes. I mean, my God, they kill an 8 year old kid in the first ten minutes. That's how you know this movie will be bad-ass and balls-to-the-wall violent. Unlike the first one, this movie actually has interesting characters that you kind of enjoy watching and listening to. They have personality, and you actually don't really want most of them to die (even though it's beyond bad-ass when they are killed). The story revolves around the Predator ship from part 1 crash landing on earth, with an alien/predator hybrid in it. They send a lone Predator to earth to ""clean up"" the mess, and let me tell you, this Predator is a complete bad-ass. If Chuck Norris had dreads, a helmet, and mandibles, he'd be this predator. No joke. This Predator goes around the small town, and hunts down the aliens, killing them off one by one in some amazingly bad-ass scenes. Caught right in the middle of this chaos are the humans, but unlike in AvP, this Predator shows no mercy towards anyone. He doesn't team up with a human, he doesn't cooperate, he goes in, cleans up, kills aliens, and if a human gets in his way, he eviscerates them. The stars of the show are obviously the Predator and Aliens, so whenever a human is on screen and they start fighting, naturally, you're just waiting for the Predator to come back and start killing. But either way, who cares. It's bad-ass. The action scenes are thrilling, to say the least. Every single action scene in the movie has at least one ""HOLY ****!"" moment, and the movie is filled with scenes that make you just say, ""That's just ****ing insane."" For instance, SPOILERS HERE, in the movie, they kill an 8 year old kid, like 30 newborn babies in a hospital (although it's not shown on screen, you know what the hell happened), and an unborn baby while it's in it's mother's belly. I am not kidding. This movie doesn't take the easy way out with characters or events. Characters that you don't expect to live die, and what they do to prevent the alien threat from spreading outside the town is pretty surprising and crazy. This movie is ****ing hardcore and brutal.The end fight with the Predator and Predalien is awesome. The fights with the Predator and Aliens are absolutely amazing, especially the hospital fight where he takes on like 5 of them. The end of this fight is nicely capped off with an unexpected ""HOLY ****!!!"" moment. You'll jump the **** out of your seat smiling when you see what happens to one of the human characters at the end of this fight.If you hated the first one, you'll love this one. If you loved the first one, you'll love this one. It amps up the action, gore, blood, thrills, and just sheer bad-assness by a million. The Brothers Strauss did an amazing job with this movie, not only visually, but pretty much on every scale possible. When you watch this, you feel like you're watching the original Predator again. All it needed was an Arnold cameo, and it'd be set.This comes out on Christmas. I'm sure Jesus will be happy to get a bad-ass present like this one.Score: 10 out of 10. It's that awesome.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
181,das417,Earth is their battleground.....,7,30 January 2008,"Aliens vs. Predator Requiem is by no means a great movie. To those who are not surprised by this (and I am guessing that is most of those who actually watched it), need I remind them that this is a movie about aliens fighting predators? This was never meant to be a contender for best picture of the year nor can one find any other reason for giving it an award. If it is ""good"" movies you want to watch then I suggest something like Flags Of Our Fathers or The Lookout.That being said, Aliens vs. Predator is a good fun for guys and girls who like watching things blow up and people being killed. Morbid, but again this is movie based upon two popular movie series and a comic book series. How can one be too critical about a movie like this?Former convict Dallas (Steven Pasquale) has returned home to a small sleepy Colorado town. However, much to his disappointment, younger brother Ricky (Johnny Lewis) has decided to fallow in his footsteps in what will most likely lead to a troubled life of pain and frustration which of course we can guess Dallas knows all about. Throw in Ricky's love interest, stereotypical hot blonde Jesse (Kristen Hager), and three school bullies who of course torment Ricky, one could easily have a plot for an episode of One Tree Hill or something similar. And as if there isn't enough drama already, Kelly O'Brian (Reiko Aylesworth) has returned from the army to husband and her now distant daughter Molly (Ariel Gade).However this small town cast of high school students, honest good working folks, military vets, and a dedicated sheriff department, are about to face a threat that none of them ever imagined. Two mortal enemies, one hunter and one prey, are about to land literally in the backyard and into all of their lives. Who survives is a matter of fate....Okay, not really. Who survives really depends on whether or not the predator, or the predator/alien hybrid breed at the end of the first movie, decides to kill them. While the first forty minutes of the film builds up something similar to a traditional plot line with real characters, it soon descends into a massacre as helpless humans are either consumed by the predator/alien hybrid's brood or cut down by the predator. There really isn't much of a need for a scene by scene explanation except to say that most of the characters, well actually pretty much the entire town, are killed off. Oh, and the nuclear bomb the US Air Force dropped on the town to ""contain"" the infestation didn't do much for the health of those in the area as well.Will there be a third Aliens vs. Predator? The few minutes we saw of Ms. Yutani at the end gave me enough pause to think that there could well be another film. And why not? Yes, this is a movie really made towards those who like seeing aliens kill each other and anyone who gets between them. Why can't we just have fun movies like this occasionally? 7/10",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
182,boe_dye,boe_dye says... YAAAAWN.... >8^P,3,1 January 2008,"You know, when you read an interview of the two guys who directed the film saying ""we are going to give people an AVP that actually shows what AVP should be"", you would expect to have lottsa of Alien and Predator beating the H3|| out of each other, and you sort of get that...towards the very end...However to get to that, you have to sit through lots of useless character development, and introduction, and plot, and...yeah...Just a lot of things that you shouldn't have to sit through to get to the slaughter that you are hoping to see...The characters were typical fair for this film, pointless and bland. In fact that was the biggest problem with the film was in trying to give them depth in a movie that really is straight and to the point.And yes, it was no holds barred... you get the general premise that no one is safe, not even innocent little babies, but by the time you get the that, who cares cause you bored out of your mind from all the pointless walking around, and talking, and poor attempt at making this film have any more depth then what it really does have.It would be like going to see snakes on a plane and expecting it to be any more then what it says it is...This tried to be more then what it said it would be and in the end lacked in what it tried to be, and lacked in what it said it was going to be.Too slow moving, too many useless plot elements, not enough eye candy, and the ending was pointless (except to set the stage for the all inevitable sequel... yea...). at least in the first AvP there is some kind of resolution and honor among warriors thing going for it, this one ends almost exactly like the second resident evil...Almost, no i take that back, it ends exactly like the second resident evil...I would say rent this movie only if it is a last resort, but certainly don't spend your hard earned money to see it in theatres.Even better, if you want to spend your money, go rent predator, go rent alien and then go buy the comic if you can find it. seeing as how they are older you can see two great movies and read the comic the movie was based on and still get back change from what it would cost you to rent this when it comes out on DVD.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
183,dudedazzreviews,They should have quit when they even thought of the idea to make a sequel!,1,6 October 2010,"From the very mediocre Alien vs. Predator comes Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem which is not only probably one of the worst sequels to a movie yet but also one of the worst sci-fi horror movies. The story is not interesting in the slightest and it doesn't really develop or grip you. There was nothing about the story that kept your attention or stuck out in your mind. Excusing a few scenes, the acting was just very bad and they didn't make me believe the characters they were portraying whatsoever. The characters were one-dimensional and you didn't care at all for any of them and they became more annoying as the movie went on. The writing was terrible and just felt like random things were happening and the direction wasn't good either. There were some okay fight scenes but that's all Requiem really had going for it.Aliens vs. Predator 2: Requiem has nothing going for it. It has a couple of good action scenes but there's nothing else. Everything in the movie could have been improved; from the bland story to the tedious characters. Also, Alien vs. Predator didn't need a sequel at all so the movie is just even more pointless and doesn't add anything to the first story whatsoever. The only thing that this movie has improved on is the blood and gore and even then, it still doesn't really add anything to the movie. The acting is absolutely dire, I just hated how they portrayed their characters because they all looked so bored. However, I've seen better acting at a Year 1 Nativity play. No doubt the writing is probably the worst thing about this movie, it's just so uninspiring and plain and it didn't really feel like any time was spent thinking about it because it just felt random and completely pointless. I personally thought that Alien vs. Predator was okay, it wasn't really good or bad but this sequel is just a disaster from start to finish. I can't speak for the fans but if you are a massive fan of Alien or Predator or both, you may enjoy this but I can't really see anybody else enjoying this monstrosity.For more reviews, please visit: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

187,LinkGoku,better then the first one by far,7,19 June 2009,"i gave this movie a 7/10 because it was a R rated action packed, not overly gory but just enough, aliens vs. predators movie, after watching the first one i doubted that they could make a good sequel, then when i heard that this one would be rated R i thought that this one would be less boring and much more action packed, the story was better but not fantastic, the acting was about the same, there were a few parts that were so dark it was hard to see, but all-in-all it delivered just what i was hoping for, now given that this movie isn't that great compared to the first one this won is a much better use of your time, die hard fans might find this movie dumb, though i liked the other alien movies i still found this one to be third favorite alien movie below aliens and alien, and my second favorite predator movie below predator, this is definitely a great achievement from my point of view.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
188,Cephyran,"Respects the material better, but still a flimsy flick...",7,27 December 2007,"Being a fan of the original mutual franchises, I had been anticipating this film as a worthy successor to the first, believing from the r-rated trailer online that it would do the canon the deserved honesty. And while it doesn't make as many blatant mistakes as the first, this film has its share of problems. The human characters are almost entirely superficial. The male lead seems to juggle back and forth between a pair of brothers, basically inconsistent enough between scenes of one lonely predator faring a thousand times better against the aliens than those inexperienced student predators from the first film. The entirety of the human cast serves as an anchor for some emotional attachment, failing because none are fleshed out thoroughly enough for you to really care about before they're killed in some gratuitous fashion. Where canon honesty is concerned, there were certainly less, if any, of the seemingly deliberate mistakes presented in the first. Amongst a handful of plot holes, I found myself responding better to this film than the first thanks to the score. The music borrows themes from both Horner's Alien scores and Silvestri's Predator scores, utilizing them to satisfactory effect. I did find the alien themes few and far between, while the telltale jungle drums of the Predator seemed a tad over-used. The special effects were fine, basically the same as the first film, with some minor differences. The volume of CG aliens, when not seen through the perspective of the predator, is drastically reduced, helping preserve the sense of realism. And now to the gore. My impression is that the filmmakers decided that since the first film had been wimped down to a PG-13, they would respect the fans who grew up with the originals, and inject some blood splatter. The big problem is that it plays too much like Starship Troopers - gore for the sake of gore. In the original Alien films, people are grabbed and vanish, with no dramatic splash of blood. Here, there's always focus on the blood, clearly an effort to redeem the franchise after the first AVP. There is certainly no lack of homages either. It's pretty clear that the army tank-top clad Reiko Aylesworth drenched in rain is intended to resemble a sweaty, grimy Ripley; one of the male supporting cast is named Dallas, and towards the end one of the two male lead switchers says ""get to the chopper!"" All I can say to this end is that they were far more subtle than the slap-you-with-it homages of the first - Bishops pen trick and so on. Overall, I'd rate this one a little better than the first, which was no hard task. It's still basically a popcorn movie, a typical shut-off-your-brain flick that will keep the fans of this crossover sated until a really effective one comes along.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
189,Pingo-2,Well... At least it's better than AvP,6,15 February 2008,"AVPR isn't really that awesome as the trailer makes it out to be. It's a nice try, and it's a stronger and better film than that AvP-thingy from Paul WS Anderson.The alien parts and the predator parts are handle with some interesting choices. The super small glimpse of Yutani and the predator home world are actually the single two best scenes in the whole film. They're like five seconds each, though, so don't get your hopes up. :) The characters in AVPR are, however, painfully boring. There are too much people running around doing nothing. There's too much stuff happening, and even if there's a lot going on, we don't care and we don't really find it that interesting.This story has been told so many times that it's almost a spoof of a cliché. The sets are tedious, the human interaction a bit confusing and sloppy, the story is flat.Action is something these two directors can handle. When there's action, it's very well done. The gore-parts are nice, the killings are cool.But who cares? Dutch in Predator was a guy we really wanted to make it - hence, the fight between him and the Predator was cool and chilling. Ripley in Aliens - same here.But these guys? I don't even remember their names...Note to the brothers (and the writer) for the next film: concentrate on fewer characters, make them interesting and try to make a character driven film. Add the action later.As a piece of entertainment with no real value, it works. It's a perfect film for the time when you need to kill an hour and a half. But if you're looking for a cult-classic, or a bit of cinema that's exciting and fun to watch - then don't bother.Because of the very good effects, the fact that this is actually another Alien vs. Predator film and that it's better than the Paul-version - I give this one a 6. It's not really the ""real"" vote - if I didn't like these Alien and Preadtor-guys so much, I would've voted a 3.But I guess that we won't get back what once were. These two sagas ended with Predator 2 and Alien 3. After that - only light entertainment made by dorks.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
190,andell,Betrays the Ideals of Both Film Series,3,16 January 2008,"Anyone who watched ""Alien vs Predator"" must've known that the conventions of the ""Alien Quadrilogy"" were not exactly adapted for the film. Amongst some of the unusual elements, the rapid growth of the Aliens over seemingly a matter of minutes, Aliens with extremely long tails, and so on. However the idea of the Predator species providing the impetus of city and temple building to create a hunt for would be warriors sounded so appealing that I couldn't resist.I had hoped the end of the film would not be the impetus of this sequel, and unfortunately I was wrong. For those who forgot how the first film ended, the dead Predator had an Alien burst through his chest which carried the traits of both species'.For this film, I'm going to just go through a list of ""good"" and ""bad"" traits.The Good: Lots of gorgeous people, especially the men. The Bad: Lots of gorgeous people get munched by both the mutant Predator/Alien, and the Predator.The Good: An interesting idea of the Predator planet. The Bad: An inconsistent scale of a town. Its a small town without many opportunities, but with a very sophisticated (read: big city) sewer system, and homeless. Is it a small town, or a city? The police force is one Sheriff and three Deputies, or so I counted.The Good: Um.... The Bad: Why do these mutant Aliens/Predators grow so fast? In a matter of five minutes, they seem to grow to their full size. I mean, c'mon...what are these things...Chia Pet Aliens??? And while we're on this subject, why is it that an Alien inside a Predator's body mutates, but an Alien in a human's body doesn't? Does that make sense?The Good: Still thinking... The Bad: Why would only one Predator come? And why does it pour acid over all the remnants of the ""Aliens,"" but it decides to murder a cute deputy, and then skin him and hang him upside down. I mean, so much for being incognito!The Good: Ah...I'm stuck. I guess there's lots of loud sounds! The Bad: How do these mutated Alien/Predators procreate? Apparently they find a pregnant woman and in a kiss type of motion, they deposit several offspring into the woman's body. Yeah, just what you'd like to see, eh? Pregnant women having their bodies explode into mutant aliens- as if the previous way wasn't gross enough!!!. I mean, there isn't even an Alien Queen.The Good: Did I say that the guys in this movie are gorgeous? The Bad: When a nuclear device blows apart buildings, how does a helicopter manage to survive the blast? And how tacky is it for one of the passengers to mockingly chide the pilot ""I told you not to crash!"" I mean, given the nuclear fallout, when he wakes up in the morning, he'll have no hair left!!!I could go on and on, but I think you get the message. Mutated Alien/Predator bursts through dead Predator's body, grows over the matter of a couple of minutes, kills all the Predators and manages to get crashed on earth. More mutant Alien/Predators are created, while ONE measly Predator comes to earth to destroy this new mutant species. Predator kills humans. Mutant Alien/Predators kill humans. Humans kill humans. Sucks to be a human in this movie, eh?If you're impressed by lots of bangs and bumps, you'll love this movie.If you liked the first, I suggest you skip this sequel.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
191,walken_on_sunshine,It's better than the first but is that saying anything at all?,4,28 December 2007,"AVP was unjustly given a death sentence in 2003 and by that i mean a PG-13 rating and writer/director Paul WS Anderson (Resident Evil/Mortal Kombat)it failed miserably among hardcore fans, average moviegoers were slightly amused, and critics despised it. Now Collin and Greg Strause two fanboys and first time directors bring us an R-Rated, gore infested Alien vs Predator sequel.The movie follows the end of the first film where a hybrid alien/predator bursts through the chest of a dead predator on board their ship. The hybrid takes out a few predators until a blast from one of their shoulder cannons blows a hole in the ship sending it on a crash collision in a little village in Colorado. They definitely set the movie up well they found a way to toss the aliens and predator back on earth without some lame we once worshiped them aztec, pyramid back story, what i like is how the Strauses stay away from all of that contradictory bull$hit.The movie suffers from a lot of set backs one it seems starved for attention. These guys seem to be willing to do anything to counteract Andersons terrible 2003 film and constantly drill the R-Rating into your head by killing kids, pregnant women, and implied babies. It's not that it offended me it just seemed like a desperate cry for attention a way for them to say ""hey this one is R-Rated remember"".The creature effects are great although in certain places the CGI looks pretty bad almost sci fi channel quality but the predators look reminiscent of the classics and the aliens look bigger and more menacing. AVP-R looks to be an action fueled film, intended to be mindless fun and brain off entertainment. The biggest problem is that despite the loads of action none of it makes you feel excited or on edge it's you just watch it you do not get into it at all. Perhaps one of the key reasons of this is the fact that you can't see much with the dark lighting, especially during fight scenes all you can make out is some dreadlocks here a tail there, green blood spraying over here. The choppy editing doesn't help either it only furthers the lack of visibility.The acting is actually alright there are very few bad actors in the film but they do stand out, the ditsy blonde feels like a Laguna Beach character her relationship with one of the protagonists is rushed and feels very unrealistic but hey who's looking for realism here. The direction of the film is right the went darker, more brutal, in a way more entertaining but the technical side of the movie needs work. A good little debut for the Strause brothers but they need to work on better editing, and better lighting they seem to be better writers then directors the exact opposite of Paul WS Anderson. Overall AVP-R somehow fails at being mindless fun but it tops the original which again isn't saying much at all.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
192,FatMan-QaTFM,"A symbolic, boring end to 2007",2,25 August 2011,"Warning: Spoilers ahead. Right, like you'll ever even rent this.Having seen the first movie in this set, I knew roughly what to expect, but had hopes for so much more. Previously on AVP, a teenage Predator gets in over his head at the Alien arcade and mommy and daddy have to come rescue him. And there's people somewhere. I wish that were a joke, but it's the plot, I swear. Basically the only way you could lose a bet is if you put all your eggs in the baskets of the Aliens (ha, sucker).The latest installment in this should be amazing series, was AVPR - which stands for Not Another AVP Failure (more or less). There are no major stars, not even a failed stand up comedian or a former Disney Channel star. I didn't read the title right, and failed to notice it said ""Predator""... not plural. The trailers led me to believe there were hordes of Aliens and an army of Predators to stop them at all cost, even when mowing down Marines (which there were about 5 of in the movie). They chickened out and didn't show a single gruesome moment. I don't know what else to say other than it was a complete disappointment and failure.It gets the fabulous F mostly because it was so boring, I could hardly stay awake. You've got to be really bad to pull that off. I even stayed awake through Nancy Drew at 1AM, so that's saying something.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
193,Sjhm,oh for pete's sake...,3,12 September 2012,"A lot of bad things were said about the first AVP, and for the most part I concur, it doesn't really fit in the canon. So, I was hoping for better things from this one.Let's start at the beginning. Why is the film so damn dark? And I don't mean figuratively, I mean literally. It's so devoid of light that most of the time the mostly unknown cast are almost completely interchangeable. Half the time, the only 'character' that I could see was the Predator purely for its red lights.The dialogue is hackneyed, the script mundane and a pale earth-bound attempt to recreate Cameron's highly successful sequel to the original, and the cast clearly culled from TV pilot season. By the time the military turn up, near the end of the movie, the script has completely dumped plot in favour of people running around in the rain, getting wet or dead as the fancy takes. Unfortunately, by then, you really do not care that much about the fate of characters you have barely caught a glimpse of in the gloom.I never thought I would say this, but the first AVP looks like a masterpiece compared to this gloomy, illogical mess.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
194,the_rattlesnake25,If wish they attacked my town before this film hit...,10,4 February 2008,"Feeling more like 'Alien and Predator vs Typical Teenage America', this life-less action-adventure film involving two past-it Sci-Fi characters is nothing less than a dreadfully clichéd waste-of-money sequel. With a particularly heavy emphasis on the word 'clichéd'.Instead of a 'hive' (or general nest of alien anarchy) being found by unsuspecting explorers, this time around it is the unlucky residents of Gunnison, Colorado who unfortunately find there lives turned up-side down by an infestation of Aliens and one really, really dedicated Predator who seems to be . The film's only fan, one would assume.What follows is scene-upon-scene of human slaughtering awfulness, as the typical American Teen Boy (Johnny Lewis), gets smitten with the typical American Teen Girl (Kristen Hager), while the clichéd reformed criminal (Steven Pasquale), helps the inept Sheriff (John Ortiz) who intern ends up getting many, many people killed in a very unsatisfying way...For the viewer that is, as keeping track of what's happening will make you wish, you were there and right in the middle of Alien nest.With a life-less, unbelievably idiotic script constantly is setting the 'AVP' ship astray (""Everybody's dead. We need guns."" - Surely a line, one of many, worthy of a mention), the film's last life-line comes in the form of D-List actors who offer nothing more than laughable acting, something which I expect in 'Asylum' films, but not a 20th Century Fox production.Finally when the credits rolled, I felt disturbed and violated for the fact that I'd just paid to see this god-awful car-crash of a so-called 'action-adventure film'. If the Brothers Strause removed the life-less acting and replace the stereotypical characters with a crate full of Aliens and Predators and let the blood flow, they may have saved this from being one of the worst films of 2008 already...",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
195,Exiled_Universe,A DECENT ACTION PACKED MONSTER FILM!!!,8,13 June 2019,"This movie was extremely better than the first avp but i still have to give it an 8 just like that one because it still has its flaws and problems. First the whole movie is dark and it gets tiring real fast and it will make you lose interest. The movie is very mid 2000's because of some of the way the characters look, act, and dress like it. The movie also gets repetitive sometimes and its rated r unlike the first one but still lacks some good gore because some good decent gore could have brung this from an 8 to a 9 and thats a maybe. The setting is a little bit of forest, sewers, but mostly in the city and thats a good thing because the first one was in the snow so its good to see the predators and aliens in the city. Both the predators and the aliens get their fair share of kills but they still lack the definition of the meaning of vs because the movie clearly has the audience voting for the predator and makes the aliens and even the alien predator hybrid look like the villains when all of them are equally as bad. It has a heavy modern tone to it with the whole army at one point and the repetitive gunfights throughout. A good thing is the movie has nonstop action so thats cool but the action varys but its ok, at least there no action. In the beginning it is kinda hard to follow along because it shows multiple characters that arent affiliated in any way and it transitions between all of them and in they end they all come together, some die some live. The ending was confusing and i coudnt tell if a sequel was being planned but hey its not too late. This will be my last review of the alien and predator franchise. Its been a long, hard, but mostly good and exiting journey :p",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
196,RichardKleiner,"Requiem, indeed",2,4 January 2008,"Even though, of the whole franchise films, I just saw Predator 2, I recognize the eminence and respect this two franchises inspire over it's fans. Having read that AvP:R was rated R, I considered it an improvement over it's predecessor. Of course, as it is for these cash-in, big budget, poor story productions nowadays, there was no real effort in script, acting or overall story. I knew that. It's almost useless to bash the average actors and the completely generic script. ""The government doesn't lie to people!"" is probably the best example of what I'm talking about.The most important thing in these movies are the action sequences and the visual effects. However, even with this, the movie was a real disappointment. Apparently, the designers thought of making Predator's armor black, as well as Alien and Predalien's skin black as well. Not only that, the writers also wanted the electricity of the whole town to black out, in the middle of the night. When you see those mechanical creatures fighting right in front of the screen, there is no way you can tell who is Predator, who is Alien and who is Predalien (Am I the only one who think this hybrid's concept is pathetic?). Obviously, the R rating came more for the language than the violence. Although it was over the top gory, there was no real violence. Just quick cuts to windows being splashed with blood, so you fill in the blanks of what actually happened there. Then, there is the gore. If I wanted to see the Predalien making out with a pregnant woman and later seeing baby Aliens bursting out of her belly, I would have asked. By the way, where did her baby go?This movie has pretty much every single cliché there is for a teen slasher flick. You already know who is going to die. Yet, the movie dedicates way too much screen time to useless or disposable characters, and when the end comes (a little too soon for me), you don't care for them. The whole movie was totally useless. When in AvP1 you sort of get a back-story to both franchises, in Requiem you just get a whole critical situation with no importance nor connection to the original films. So what if the Predalien had ever existed. We don't see him in the original Alien movies, do we? Have the producers considered adapting a script from a comic book? The comics have a more faithful portrayal of both creatures, am I wrong? Now, I could understand the critical situation that an Alien outbreak on Earth would mean. But, if the Predator is such a noble and smart warrior, why wouldn't he call for backup to stop the Aliens? And why does he uses his magic blue potion to evaporate the Alien's victims remains to erase evidence, and still, take his time to skin ""alive"" (even though he killed) an innocent bystander? The Aliens seem to have been quite quick to grow and reproduce, quicker than several years into the future!The title ""Requiem"" actually is the appropriate one. This movie is a mass of death for both ""Alien"", the Ridley Scott sci-fi classic,and ""Predator"", the John McTiernan action adventure, being killed off by the producer's attempts to join them together. Oh, how you miss those good ol' directors.Even though there's obviously going to be another sequel, to the looks of it, it won't be faithful to neither of the previous films. ""Hell, let's make a trilogy"" the executives at Fox may be thinking. ""Let's hire another mediocre director and use the first script we can find"". ""But what of the continuity with the other movies?"" an innocent newcomer may ask. ""Who cares?"" the executive would answer.If you're looking for a serious cinematic experience, you already know you'll avoid this piece of crap. But if you're a horror , AvP or teen slasher fan (or all of the above), I'll tell you: It's not worth it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

198,movedout,holds a big bag of promise but never seems to deliver just a glimmer of it,4,3 January 2008,"The bar is set so low on ""Aliens vs. Predator 2"" that it is staggering to imagine how it fell short of it. The first film was a guilty pleasure at best, a cathartic release for fans of the respective franchises, and a need for novelty fulfilled. With that need no longer present, the sequel treads the same ground, feebly ups the stakes, reduces the sense of claustrophobic doom from transposing the confrontations from pyramid to a darkened Colorado town, and increases the number of these ugly bags of mostly water for the butchering. It's hard to think of a sadder fate for these terrifying extraterrestrials from ""Aliens"" and ""Predator"" than being reposed to the ignominy of gutter monsters strung up for ostensibly, yet another slasher film that's not actually good even on its own merits as a genre entry.The intergalactic Rastafarian hunter once again wears the mantle of the hybrid franchise's antihero, a quickly humanised character as evinced in the closing scenes (that almost immediately segues into the sequel's opening scenes) with Sanaa Lathan in the previous film. It is also perhaps the best feature of the entire series considering that it lets this particular monster actually retain some measure of dignity as opposed to its counterpart's reduction into cartoonishly bloodthirsty critters with acid blood that squawk and hiss interminably. As the title of the film now clearly adds, there are Aliens versus a single sluggish Predator, making it the filmmaker's choice for which of these creatures is the most worthy contestant in this battle royale. There's a fair point to be made that given the franchise's emphasis on its titular outlanders that the only purpose a sequel could have served would have been to take the series into darker, riskier and more imaginative territory by eliminating the presence of these annoyingly puny meatbags we call human beings altogether. Unfortunately, its idea of reinvention is to create a literal hybrid of the creatures into a Predalien/Alienator sort of colony queen.If there's something good to be extrapolated from this incarnation of this bartardisation of the franchises, it would be that it serves as a reminder that CGI just isn't all that. The directors  the Brothers Strause (Colin and Greg)  are visual effects specialists (with a resume that is admittedly pretty impressive), making their feature film directorial debut, use the tried and tested man-in-monster-suit approach that is both gory and effectively organic to the Predator's filmic origins. Their appointment does point to the priority undertaken in the film and this gamble shows them up in unflatteringly aspects as well. Basic film-making techniques are taken for granted here when the film consistently displays abnormally dim lighting, erratic cuts during crucial fight scenes and a lack of spatial awareness.""Aliens vs. Predator 2"" starts middling soon after a promising enough start. It's the sort of film that holds a big bag of promise but never seems to reach in to deliver just a glimmer of it. There are few scenes of actual terror (including one set in a hospital that once again could have really pushed the film into a truly dark and memorable place), excitement and decent chuckles. Its only real horror is turning these icons of horror into trashy minstrels.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
199,fritzlang,Direct to video film accidentally released in theaters,6,26 December 2007,"for an extremely low budget direct-to-video film by a no name company, this wasn't bad. For little or no money, the F/X weren't bad, a new breed of creatures were introduced and there were some decent scenes. Actings was okay. Not bad for a Saturday afternoon! Wait - this is not an extremely low budget film. It was released in theaters by a major studio with very popular creatures. Thus I expected much much more. The photography was horrid - most creature shots were extreme close up with no light. I have NO idea of what the predatalien looked like - it might have been cool, but couldn't tell since they way it was photographed! The fight scenes were horrendous - again, couldn't tell what was going on the way it was shot.Acting wasn't too bad, but there was no single character to care for or who stood out. Even the woman who used to run CTU (On 24) was abysmal.As I said, if this was a DTV film by Full Moon entertainment, then I would have enjoyed it more. But from a major studio like Fox? The plot, what little there was, didn't make any sense.Despite there was 1 predator and a gazillion aliens, this is really a predator movie. The aliens were weak. I mean, killing an alien with a .38? A .38???? sheeesh.....I enjoy these creatures so much that despite all of this, I still had a decent time. Just don't expect much....",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
200,mfnmbvp,'Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem' (2007),6,16 March 2012,"I guess I should note that I never did see 'AVP: Aliens Vs. Predator' the first entry, but by the looks of this second installment, which is just ubiquitously named 'Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem' I think that it hardly matters at all. After all, I haven't seen 'Aliens' or 'Alien 3' for that matter, nor have I seen 'Predator' or 'Predator 2' in quite awhile.It all starts when an alien spacecraft crash lands in the forest of what looks like Oregon or Washington or something, and the aliens run amok killing and preying on the locals until a lone Predator comes along to clean up the mess. In so doing, he also mercilessly kills the townsfolk who it almost half seems he is trying to protect. This gives us a sense that there is little continuity throughout, but we can work with that. Our cameras look a lot better now than they did in 1979 when Ridley Scott first gave us 'Alien', and those leaves on the trees look so fresh and crisp it almost tastes like a can of Sprite. But then the other half of the time the film is so dark and blurry that the audience will struggle to tell what the hell is going on, and who has just been killed, which is the Alien and which is Predator in some cases even. This makes it seem like the filmmakers were shamelessly trying to trick us into thinking that there is actually a lot more s**t going on here than there actually is, because we'll just think that we must have missed it 'cuz it was so damn dark in the first place.Regardless, our multiple characters are pretty shallowly written, with some third-rate dialog that basically just serves as a vehicle to help explain a little bit of vague background on our characters. This slight development is pretty much all that we get and that's pretty much all that we need; most of these people are going to end up dying slasher movie style anyhow before the third act. We have our small-town sheriff who is probably the most likable character in the entire lot, the female war hero who has just returned to town, the reformed trouble-maker who has also just returned to town, and then we have our typical cast of high school kids who are almost as bad at reciting their lines as the lines themselves are sometimes. When there was still a half-hour of the film left, I was just sitting there thinking about how they could possibly drag this on for another 30 minutes because we are basically just treated to a massive body count with the occasional showdown between the aliens and predators. The film resembles what 'Slither' had done a year earlier, except 'Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem' takes itself waaayyyy more seriously than 'Slither' ever did. 'Slither' was a satire of alien invasion flicks, and it worked tremendously well. Here, it looks beautiful (when we can actually see it) but by the end it burns out quickly, almost too quickly, and if you've already seen how this one ends, I can say it is pretty disappointing, especially if you've been a die hard fan of the series for so long. I personally thought the little comic books that came with the action figures were almost more exciting at times. This film gives us a peek at what it could have been, but tragically it fails to do so much that could have been done. We even have a character named Dallas here. Has it really been that long that we need to pay homage to the original in such an obvious way like that? I recommend you see this film, but I recommend you watch 2010's 'Predators' with Adrian Brody afterward, which you will most likely enjoy far more.ALIENS VS.

In Addition - this is the most complete Rip-Off of the James Cameron ""Aliens"" movie that I have ever seen!! Most thieves only take the money and leave the vault. In AVPR they lift the Characters, Story, Lighting, Dialogue! and virtually everything else that is not nailed down directly from ""Aliens"". James Cameron could successfully litigate this with one lawyer. Not only is it a Bad movie - it is based on someone else's Excellent movie. The fact that AVPR has made 30 million so far is a testament to our McDonalds culture - the Lowest Common Denominator wins out over substance and talent. Wait for the DVD and drink heavily before watching - you will need it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
203,marimbadaddy,"Brain candy, if you like to feast on violence and gore.",3,10 May 2008,"A brief view of the Alien and Predator Series The Alien series began with an incredibly and intensely scary movie. The sequel, Aliens, moved the series towards a more action oriented and violent flick. Each successive Aliens sequel has gotten progressively worse in plot, and much more gory and violent. The first Predator film was fun, a bit gory, but shared the original Alien's frightening aspects, though to a lesser degree. Though Predator 2 was not as exciting as the first, it was still pretty good.AVPR - Look ma, how much brain matter we can explode in one film! This film is horrible through and through. Well, except the sound is good, special FX are very good. The only tidbit of a redeeming quality the script had was that it actually picked up with the tread the previous AVP film had left for a sequel. The acting is pretty lame, though the true fault is the terrible script.I believe that the ability to successfully watch this movie is utterly dependent on having seen several of the parent films, and the first AVP movie. As this movie jumps right in, with no pointer scene anywhere, and no effort to explain the Alien's or Predator's presence on Earth, I think most viewers with no Alien and Predator experience would be utterly lost and frustrated. Seeing that Alien will be nearly 30 years old at the release date of AVPR, (though easily obtained on DVD) it is unintelligent to rely on a viewer's prior knowledge of the seres.There must be 17 different subplots in this movie, most of which never get resolved because the characters involved in the subplots eventually are killed off in some ultrabloody manner. When in an action movie is the audience supposed to be confused as to what relationships the various characters have with each other? Most of the other films in the series followed the same simple formula: build or send in a team of 8 to 12 people; kill them off one by one in creative ways; the lone surviving hero(ine)has a showdown with the creature; the hero(ine)says some pithy quote; defeats the creature; roll credits. I count three ""heros"" in this movie, none of which has a showdown with either of the creatures. Even the Alien and Predator end up in a draw.This movie is far too violent, and for really no good reason. Filmmakers used to be clever regarding how to imply heads exploding without actually showing it. I think we get to see that three or 4 times in this flick (just the human head count mind you.) Yes I expected some violence and gore as both series had gone in that direction over the decades. However, I recall the violence and gore was supposed to serve the scary factor, not a comic book sensibility.The mutated alien-predator combo is just plain stupid. They used that device in the 4th Alien flick, but at least it was a result of genetic experimentation, not some random mutation that serves to plot a new sequel, as was the case in AVPR. (Again, interesting that they used it as a leftover from the previous AVP, but dumb none the less.) If you, as I do, enjoy action and/or sci fi flicks, and have followed the Aliens series, you'll want to see this. But it is a major disappointment. I would imagine that despite this terrible piece, they'll make yet another AVP movie. If they could just get a great director like Ridley Scott, or James Cameron involved, they might turn the AVP series into something interesting, and something other than a bloodfest.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
204,alanrayford,WTF people...this movie delivers!!,9,16 April 2008,"I didn't see AVP 2 in the theatres. I saw it on DVD in the relative comfort and solitude of my living room. As such, I really don't see why everybody on IMDb has seen fit to hate on this flick. I liked AVP 2 and think it was one of the better films in the franchise--for pure guttural thrills.I will admit that the first AVP was a waste of film and time. But, I can't say that about this sequel. despite its dubious origins, it actually succeeds at being better, by far, than the original. It was friggin' awesome to see the aliens on Earth, stalking small town USA. This is largely because it didn't respect the typical boundaries of the genre. If Brock Samson, from the Venture Bros., saw this film, his eyes would bulge out--no women and children my ass.When that ship crashed and the hunter and his child went to see it, I figured they'd escape. When the father was killed, I just knew the son would still get away--he didn't. I am a huge fan of the genre and see through most movies. That one death scene knocked me on my butt, because it established that no one was off limits. Pregnant chicks, the hot ex-girlfriend, children, they were all open to a violent end and many met them. Horror movies become terribly boring when you know who will live and who will die, which was not the case with this one I have to say. Yes, the characters weren't that well developed. But, seeing as how there was no guarantee they were going to live, does it really matter.Another great part of this movie, which was sooo very lacking in the rest of the franchise, is that it was relatable. I don't live in the future and, therefore, can't claim to know what a space station looks like. However, I do know a hospital, a school, a diner, and a standard neighborhood when I see one. Hell, I patronize diners frequently. Seeing a poor waitress impregnated with three xenomorophs in a kitchen registered with me more than seeing it in yet another gun-metal grey hallway or ventilation shaft ever would. With everything being set in a real world environment, the movie just had more of an impact on me.Lastly, the full title of this film is Alien Vs. Predator: Requiem. They are the true stars of this film and they are the ones who set the pace. The ship crashed because of an Alien. The human characters banded together after running for their lives from the Aliens. Chaos ensued when the Predator knocked out the power for the whole town. Coolness came about when the ex-con got his hands on the Predator's gun and was lighting things up. In short, it was the aliens who dictated how the story progressed and all the humans could do was react and hope to survive--which only four pulled off. It's only fitting that the actors were playing abstracts, at best.All in all, AVP 2 really delivers. An appropriate level of violence--check. A high body count, which keeps you on your feet--check. Cookie cutter characters who you won't really care about until they die gruesomely and unexpectedly--check. Decent FX that effectively convey the inherent danger of the story for the viewer--check. A storyline and acting which require no effort to follow, allowing you to just watch, cringe, and enjoy--check.To everybody who doesn't like this movie I say this. Don't hate it for what it isn't: a masterpiece, a life changing event, grand art, or a trend-setter. Anybody could do that and they'd be missing the point. Love AVP 2 for what it is: dark, grim, violent, unexpected, seemingly random, and, lastly, wholly entertaining. If another sequel is done, I hope it is paced like this one and not like a doctoral dissertation which has to explain the setting in great detail. A nine out of ten!!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
205,mcw6957,Game Over Man!,6,1 January 2008,I was 6 when I saw Alien in the theater and have never looked back. I own two versions of every Alien movie made. It is the only series of films from my childhood that as an adult I still find joy in. Not Indiana Jones.Not Star Wars. I love the two Predator movies as well but not as obsessively so as Aliens. When AVP 1 was released I ran to see it despite the pg-13 rating and was disappointed but not as horrified as some fan-boys were. Then came the uncut DVD and that made it a little better. AVP 2 is a messy undercooked follow up that I was skeptical to see but see it I did. Im not ashamed to admit that despite all its problems I still enjoyed AVP 2. Were not talking about stand alone movies here these are quick cash grabs to sustain fans until the right people decide to stop sitting on their hands. I know the anticipation for the next big balls Alien or Predator movie is unbearable.I KNOW!!!! Also realize the bar for both these franchises has been set very very very high and the fact that no major players really want any part in these movies makes it difficult to try and top that. So instead what we get is a modern day equivalent of Dracula vs. Frankenstein or Godzilla vs. Mothra. I don't see either AVP movies trying to be anything more than that and thats fine by me. I just hope probably more so with AVP 2 than 1 we get to see a directors cut as opposed to just the R rated version with more blood and guts and action. AVP 2 pros: Dallas also known as Garrity from Rescue Me plays a much more able hero then he does on that show and owns this movie. John Ortiz also known as Ruben from The Job another Leary/Tolan vet plays against small town stereo type sheriff. Reiko Aylesworth plays a newly single mom and made me REALLY miss Ripley. Stoners and jocks are useless in a crisis.Got that?! Aliens eat babies Predators do not funny very funny. The blonde slut gets owned big time. The government blows up an entire town full of people.Ha! Ha! Big brother has the Predator gun.Very cool.Cons: Everything else.,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
206,travisvincent,"Stupid, Stupid, Stupid",3,5 May 2008,"I am a big fan of the Alien franchise. Having never seen them as a teen and only seeing them from the past ten years i have grown to love this series and sigourney weaver. the sequels were good too, which brings me to AVP. AVP was a decent movie, giving horror fans a nice mash-up.However, AVP2, is just dreadful. Stupid plot, stupid acting and stupid everything else. This movie is so full of clichés its not even entertaining, you can see whats going to happen well before it actually happens.the actors look like they'd rather be in a teen slasher movie, which is really what this film is, a slasher movie, the aliens and predators look great but with the scene so dark and a lot of fast camera moves, its hard to tell whats going on. all in all, i would skip this and rent the first and second ones instead.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
207,soger,Power saving slasher movie,7,31 July 2008,"We can say that this movie has 7 previous parts: Predator 1,2, Alien 1 to 4 and AvP. Well, this movie is nothing like any of those. All of those had a strong character. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny Glover, Sigourney Weaver and Sanaa Lathan doesn't just kill the enemy, they also achieve moral victory in a really unfair fight. This movie has no heroes, people are just running around and predators and aliens are killing them (and also each other) almost like a slasher movie.But the most annoying thing about this movie is that it is too dark. The director is probably an environmentalist who wanted to save power on the CRT displays... Well, jokes aside I guess the darkness is there to increase the tension of the movie but it is so aggravating. The movie probably has good visual effects but I can't see them, it's too dark.After AvP, which by the way in my opinion was an excellent movie, I could not wait to see the continuance. But this movie does not deliver anything valuable. I give 7 stars to the movie, maybe it deserves less, maybe more I don't know, it's hard to be objective when you are disappointed.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
208,Medacakathareal,Way worse than the first,5,20 April 2008,"I found the first AVP entertaining enough to give it a passing grade, though I was disappointed, after all, they could've done better, so when I heard about a new AVP, one rated R and featuring a Predator Alien hybrid I thought for sure Hollywood was finally getting it right...Boy was I wrong...The film is a cut and paste homage (i should say copy) of other films, with lines like ""Get to the Chopper"" and scenes of Predator healing his wounds, but when a line like ""Get to the Chopper"" is delivered by no name talent it sickens the stomach... What we have here is standard horror movie fair, almost as though the creators were aiming for the same PG-13 audience that see movies like One Missed Call, and other stupid movies...The film does Predator and Alien a huge disservice. The aliens look different and the puppeteering of them looks almost as bad as the shoddy CGI used where a man in a suit looked so much more real in former Alien films... There are a few scenes that were cool or action filled, but in the end I had to dumb myself down to enjoy it.The characters are lightly drawn, a few teens, a sheriff, a military guy, but no one we really care too much about... The main character, a pizza delivery man, elicits only a ""I was there once too"" reaction... The film feels rushed, and being an amateur script writer I could tell they'd rushed through with an early draft, the story is far from mature...Dumbing myself down I soon noticed the hotness of Kristen Hager (who plays Jesse in the film) but towards the end (of this extremely short movie) she dies, but I didn't feel any emotional pain, just lost a piece of eye candy. Indeed even to her main man Ricky (played by Johnny Lewis) she seems like just a sexual item, perhaps some high school crush emotion, but that's about all I got out of their interaction...Many awfully shot, uncooly choreographed scenes later we get the films climax, what's the military do in every horror film when they need to quarantine, they blow the city up... But the survivors we didn't even care about are caught by the military and let live? Yeah right, we all know the government would have them shot to truly wipe the town off the map...The only good parts are the pretty girls and the fact that the movie kills a great deal of people, including a kid, not many movies are brave enough to have a chest popping alien burst from a little kid... Do yourself a favor, write your own AVP story, I guarantee it will be better than this movie...",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
209,Hellrazr360,Attempting To Return To Form,10,25 December 2007,"Before I actually start my review, I'd just like to make it clear that I personally enjoyed the first Alien vs. Predator movie, courtesy of the man everyone loves to hate: Paul W.S. Anderson. Yes, it was cheesy. Yes, it was paradoxical. And yes, the movie did feel rather light on the content for an Alien/Predator movie. Regardless, I still enjoyed watching the action scenes, felt that there was ample character development and that I got my money's worth when I saw it. Then came time for the Brothers Strause to try and impress me, time to see how they did.The first thing to really notice about the new AVP, subtitled ""Requiem"" is that the acting is pretty laughable. The actors here are a bunch of no-names and do very little with their roles. I will say that the two actors playing the brothers did stand out, but that really isn't saying too much. The dialogue, as you might've guessed is really corny and only seems to work for half a chuckle in maybe three or four scenes.Just like the first Alien vs. Predator film, Requiem has a fairly slow build-up and it's tough to really gain much interest with most of the first few minutes being dedicated to the human characters. This normally wouldn't be an issue if these characters were more likable. But as they stand in the film, it's tough to really feel that much of a connection. After the first thirty or so minutes however, the movie does begin to eventually pick up and get more interesting. This is when the film starts to try and return to the violent, bloody form that both the Predator and Alien movies were known for.While gore and violence don't make an action scene (part of why I didn't have much problem watching the first AVP), it definitely does make the action in this film feel better and more authentic. The Strause Brothers were definitely going for a ""balls-to-the-wall"" kind of approach here, and it definitely shows. Requiem's action scenes are plentiful, but they don't engulf the whole movie, or even the middle for that matter. But there are a decent amount and some of them are pretty neat to watch and might make you go ""woah"". These prove to be the film's best parts: where the aliens, predator and the ""predalien"" go at it.However, after seeing a good few of these scenes they also start to show some cracks; some are even easy to spot. By almost the first action scene, I was squinting my eyes to make out what exactly was going on. I almost felt like I was watching a Michael Bay film or something because the action scenes movie in the blink of an eye and some parts are so dark, you think they're trying to downright copy the original Alien. There are also several throwbacks to previous movies in both the Alien and Predator universe. These range from the Predator's medical equipment, to some of the quotes and in one case: character names.The whole film almost feels like a trip down memory lane with a few new things added in to spice things up. This mostly comes out with the action scenes, as there are some that are eye-popping and are also where the film gets the bulk of its praise. Unfortunately, action just can't save the whole film because half of the time you're struggling to keep up and see what exactly is happening. The movie is also very short, not even clocking in at an hour and a half, so it's easy to feel you're not getting a whole movie's worth. This also is a sign that the film could've had so much more and the action scenes could've been given so much more attention to detail without making the whole thing drag on.Then there's the ending, and man, let me just say that the ending alone is enough to ruin the whole thing for you. And I'm not just referring to the very end of the film, I'm also talking about the near-end scene (hint: in the jungle). Normally I would've been okay if the credits rolled when the screen went black in the jungle, but no, that wasn't enough. The real end to the film is so random, misplaced and soul-crushing, that I don't think I'll ever see any other AVP movies after that. It's that bad. So if you plan on seeing this movie, leave the theater right after the scene in the jungle that feels like the end. Trust me, you don't want to see the real ending.Overall I'd say Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem is a tough recommendation simply for all its obvious flaws. There are some good, and a couple great action scenes, but most of them are either too tough to follow or too dark to even make out. Not only that, but the ending just drops it right down into what I think is the worst movie in both the Alien and Predator movies combined. This year has been a huge disappointment for me as far as movies go, and this one didn't do anything to make me feel any different.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
210,lekgolah,An enjoyable final act makes up for a slow beginning,4,6 June 2010,"The first Alien Vs Predator film was average at best and from what I've read, the unrated edition to that film was more entertaining, so I decided to watch the sequel's unrated edition instead of the theatrical release. So this will be a review of the unrated edition.The film starts directly after the original with a weird mixture of an alien crossed with a predator killing other predators onboard their ship, which crashes into Earth. Here we are introduced to the human characters and I have to say that they are all uninteresting but they manage to serve their purpose. Admittedly the characters in AVP were better but I felt watching this film thinking that the director had a better understanding of what he was doing.While the first the third is slow as it focuses on the humans, it soon picks up as the body- count rises, which is where the film gets exciting. The fight scenes between the aliens and the predator are really exciting, particularly towards the end where the humans are caught in the middle of a big fight scene. The Predator uses all of its gadgets to kill the aliens (and a few humans) and these scenes are the best in the film. If you go in hoping for a good film then you probably be disappointed. This was fun and if you do choose to purchase this, then don't pay too much. This is no Aliens which I think will be obvious to most people. The film is very dark in terms of lighting and this does sometimes ruin what is happening on-screen but when you can see the action, it becomes entertaining. Fans will enjoy the final act of the film but its just a shame that when the film is with the human characters, it felt like a lazy teen drama that slows the film down dramatically. It is however worth watching these scenes to get to the exciting finale where alien heads are being shot in the air to pieces. While the characters are not as good as the ones from AVP, the action is far more exciting and if you are interested in watching this, I strongly recommend the unrated edition.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

I don't care for B movies, and I'd like to be aware, from the beginning, that I am spending my hard earned money on a film that just isn't worth the price of a DVD. I've enjoyed most of the Aliens movies ... as well as the Predator movies ... but this one made a huge joke out of them. First off ... why all the dim lights? So much of the movie's best parts were so dark I couldn't see much of anything. The dolphin squeals were disturbing! The early Alien and Predator movies were as visual pleasing as they were with their sound effects and animation ... this movie is a cheap knock-off that just doesn't hit the mark.

214,Matador07,And so the fanboy franchise marches on...,6,30 April 2008,"A movie not as bad as those who were actually disappointed in it might claim -- I think having a dripping disdain for the entire fanboy its-so-kewl origin of the AvP series may actually have helped when watching this one.At this point all of the rules and atmosphere carefully constructed by far FAR more talented writers and directors decades ago have been almost completely lost to time. Its been 20 years since the last truly good Alien or Predator movie, and once you accept that and look at this as nothing more or less than a simple B movie ripoff, its not terrible. Hardly a ringing endorsement, but the best something like this can get. It certainly beat the brain dead PG-13 stupidity of the first AvP which tripped over its own comic book kewl to the point of being nonsensical.AvP Requiem...well, its not a smart movie by any remote stretch. It is in every way conceivable a B movie. It has the clichés, the plot holes, the occasional non-sensical decision making (hello, you are driving a tank -- how about you just turn it around and head up the road OUT of town?). But looked at as nothing more than a B movie entertainment, its better than many, perhaps even most. The story is simple, straight forward, and generally the sort of thing that any hack can execute reasonably. Alien monsters crash to Earth near small town, everyone dies. And after half an hour of non-character development (the only actor to make any impact was a smokingly hot blond, and that only because she strips down to her underwear), the movie gets right to the carnage. This is no classic and you will forget about it within a week, but as B movies go it delivers fast paced scifi/horror fun without even pretending to explore larger themes. If they could have hired even one actor with any real presence, written one role with any real edge, it might even have been memorable. I think even amusingly bad acting might have been preferable to the vanilla bland nothingness on display here.One note about this franchise, and the aliens in particular. In Alien the creature was possibly the scariest thing ever put on celluloid. Seemingly indestructible, experiencing neither emotion nor pain, able to live in any environment, a black dripping slimy combination of insect and reptile, it was the stuff of nightmares. But in sequel after sequel now we have seen far too much. And the indestructible aliens have been sacrificed on the altar of this fanboy series to become just another opponent. Tough to be sure, but we've seen hundreds of them killed at this point, and the Predator in this installment of the series singlehandedly wipes out dozens of them, sometimes three, four, five at a time in hand to hand combat. And so the Alien's fearsomeness seems almost at an end -- it began in Alien 3 when the last third of the movie had its prisoners playing tag with their Alien in order to lure it to its doom. And maybe now its almost complete as we finally discover that 20th century light arms are all that's required to put them down. Get a bunch of hicks with hunting rifles crammed into the back of a pickup and let's go Alien hunting. Fortunate that the crew of the Nostromo had not packed a single vintage M-16 in their cargo or the whole franchise might never have gotten off the ground.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

I work for Movie Gallery so I was able to rent the unrated DVD of the film before it hits the shelves this Tuesday. The sound was really great, but the whole film was so dark that I could not see anything, I mean I really may have enjoyed this movie if it were not so dark. I remember horror films from the early 70's and going to the drive-in to see them, I remember that most of them were very dark and that you could not really see much of anything in them. This is just what it reminded me of. I think that this would have been a really great film if only I could have seen it. I think that ht e brightest part of the whole movie was the small part where we get to see the predators home planet, it is this reason and this reason alone that I gave the film such a low rating.

217,The_Defiant1,"Actors 0, Special Effects 1",6,26 December 2007,"Wow! Where to begin!? The best thing this movie has going for it is the same creatures and effects we've seen in the past. If you liked the Aliens and Predators from the past movies, now we get to see more. The movie shows no inclination to explain anything anymore, they just throw it at the viewer and see who cares. The second best thing that it has going for it is that it's better than the first Aliens vs. Predator. The last version ended with the female lead star standing out on the Ross Ice Shelf of Antarctica wearing a tank top. Evidently she's impervious to hypothermia. The last movie gave us a Pyramid maze to keep us disoriented for 2 hours.This movie fortunately takes place in a normal setting. Aliens have started invading a small Colorado town. One Predator is dispatched to take them out of action. This movie has no shocks or surprises. The story is irrelevant and it's not too different than a ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Halloween"" slasher movie. The characters in the movie just get killed violently one after another. It leans towards pure sadism because none of the characters really prove to be a hero. It's just run, die, run. Only the lucky survive.The good thing about this movie is that it doesn't drag. It starts at a good pace and it maintains that pace. It would have been nicer if there was more than one Predator fighting the Aliens or if the writer showed more respect for the characters.Overall the movie was just okay. Nothing special. It's better suited for a younger audience. If you were looking for a movie with a hero, there is none in this one.See it in the theater if you are bored. Wait to rent the DVD if you just have to see it. Only buy the DVD if you are trying to collect the whole series.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

These films will never get the chance to be made how they should be because FOX is to scared to pay up a large amount of cash on a 18 cert film that runs along time and costs them loads, they are just not willing to take the risk so what we get is a toned down version that never has the chance to build up and set a story because its run time will never be fit it in, FOX want people in and out popcorn films, a UK 15 cert means more bums on seats and yes I know even if they have a 18 cert it does not mean they be better but it does mean such things as over fast editing and holding back would be at a min, the next thing needed is cash as putting everything in the dark to help cover cheaper suits or cgi is not great, and length is needed to build up the story and show you more, the film is what it is, a hack and slash with Aliens and Predators, it does what it set out to do and with the money given they have made a good action film, the only real thing that holds this film back is to dark and editing is to fast, had they been able to spend more on the fights where they could show more rather than a flash and a punch and a rip and a quick flash then that would of helped, also showing more from the Predators home world and more from its point of view, yeah another risk FOX will never take, and so to end take into mind the money they had, the pressure from FOX as these guys are no big names in Hollywood so what FOX says goes, and the age cert and how long the film must run and what you have is as good as you will get and this will not change until the above points are changed, for me go see this film as its just good comic book scfi that is not scared to kill people most films would not which I for one loved :-)",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
219,gabriel-80,It will rock your socks off!!!,8,12 January 2008,"Okay then, now I have seen the movie that almost everyone loves to bash. To begin with, yes, the acting is only okay for this sort of movie, some of the dialog is cheesy and the plot is extremely simple, but my god was this movie entertaining. The movie is really intense from the first frame and just doesn't let go until its finished. It was actually thrilling in many scenes (much to my surprise) even though I couldn't care less about all the one-dimensional characters coming and going. The battle scenes were somewhat confusingly edited, but still cool none the less. The movie has this raw editing and photography that really gives it an edge compared to AvP 1. What I liked the most was that the movie does not compromise anything. The aliens kill everybody, and I literally mean everybody, breaking every Hollywood rule about what is proper to show on screen. I didn't feel like watching a slasher movie, but felt that the killings were logical and random, like they should be when aliens run amok in a small town. One of the killings is actually surprising and kind of fun. AvP: Requiem is a bad movie if you look at it in a wider perspective, but as a fan-, nerd- and genre movie it will rock your socks off with its raw and brutal look on a few chaotic hours when a Small town is infested with aliens. It has to be chaotic, and I was relieved that the screenwriter didn't come up with some stupid storyline where the characters has to find some kid or anything like that. The movie is all about surviving a threat no one knows anything about until its too late. It is also really nice to see that they work harder to obey the rules made up in the two separate movie franchises. They do bend them as in AvP 1, but not to much. Great fun. Go see it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
220,stewiefan201,Aliens vs. predator: Requiem is a B-movie guilty pleasure. But it really doesn't do the two titled legendary creature-features much justice.,6,5 April 2008,"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem is the second installment of the new AVP franchise. The story takes off exactly where the last movie left us. The predators are leaving Earth on their ship, when suddenly a new hybrid breed of Predalien bursts out of a dead predator's chest. The predalien proceeds to kill all the predators on board, and the ship ends up taking a U-turn, and crashes in the large woods of small town Gunnison, Colorado. The facehuggers break out and lay baby aliens in a father and son hunting near the ill-fated ship, and their chests burst open and thus starts the alien infestation. A lone predator warrior is sent to Gunnison in order to stop the aliens, and wipe clean the details that the aliens were ever there in the first place. Meanwhile we meet a few characters which include an ex-con named Dallas (Steven Pasquale); his pizza boy brother Ricky (Johnny Lewis); the girl Ricky has a crush on named Jesse (Kristen Hager) the town Sheriff Eddie Morales (John Ortiz); and returned Iraq war veteran Kelly (Reiko Aylesworth). They all have to band together in one dark, rainy night in order to survive. As the aliens are led by the predalien, and multiply in huge numbers, as the lone predator hunts them down and kills them.2004's Alien Vs. Predator was a horrible movie, full of stupid characters, and a lot of CGI overkill. And of course it was rated PG-13 which ruined the violence and battle scenes, and disgracing the Alien and Predator name. Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem is really not a very good movie either, but it's far more enjoyable than the first AVP. The characters here are very cardboard, but you know what if the title has the words Aliens, Predator, and a ""Vs."" sign in the middle, I fully realize that's what the movie's going to be about. The actors are adequate enough here I guess, and a few of the characters actually stand a chance in the end. Unlike the first AVP where 3 quarters of the characters were killed in ten minutes. The character Dallas is obviously a heyday back to the original Alien, and the presence of the Irag war vet Kelly is supposed to resemble Ripley. She's no Ellen Ripley of course, but at least the film knows that. As for the other characters, I think it was a big mistake to make one of the main characters a pizza boy. And also why have a teenage romance going on in this movie? These characters and side plots don't belong anywhere near this type of movie. We apparently go from a space military (Aliens), to a war in the jungle (Predator), predator kicking drug dealer booty in LA (Predator 2), to a pizza boy's crush on the cute girl from school? I think you get the picture.Now for the action, the part you go to see this type of movie for. I'll tell you that the action is actually pretty intense. But it can get pretty underwhelming and disappointing at times. The editing in this movie is really bad because during the action scenes it cuts too quickly, and the camera moves around too much to the point where you barely get a clear image. At one point during a scene involving the predator killing some cop in the woods, I thought somebody dropped the camera. And I thought Cloverfield's camera angles were all over the place? Another huge problem with this movie is the lighting and cinematography. I'm not sure if the budget was so low that the Brothers Strause (directors) could only afford paper matches. But maybe the costumes would look too cheesy if exposed in full light. The directors reverted back to the original film-making style of these two alien and predator sagas. Instead of using a lot of CGI, they actually used robotics and suits for most of the action scenes. They probably used the rain and minimal lighting so that you wouldn't be able to see the zippers (Haha). Other than the lighting and editing problems, there's not as much predator-alien mash ups going on in this 93 minute film. But when the battles do occur, they're pretty intense and cool. The fact that this movie has an R rating also improves the action greatly in comparison to the first movie.However I don't understand why there's only one predator. The predators are developed as smart, intellectual hunters in their two films. But here they're not even smart enough to send more than one. This warrior predator has a few cool new gadgets and trickery, but without more predators around the movie felt a little hollow. We only really see predators die in the first scene, and sadly that's really not enough. Also the predalien seems to be very evolved. He pops out of the predator's stomach, and in what seems to be minutes he is full size. She can also lay multiple babies within people without use of facehuggers. I just wish the predalien was explained a little more, and that the directors did a little more with the concept.Overall Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem is definitely a B-movie. The budget didn't seem to be as high as the first movie, but the use of actual animatronics is a lot cooler than AVP's CGI. This movie is a little underwhelming, and isn't completely satisfying. But the action is intensely cool, despite the bad editing and lighting, and the short running time. I give Aliens Vs. Predator: Requiem a 2.5 out of 4. It's much better than the first, mostly due to the use of an R rating and mechanics instead of flashy F/X.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
221,diztorted,It made me long for Anderson,3,26 December 2007,"I just wanted to comment on this movie because what I have to say feels like poison that unless I spit it out it will kill me. The movie just plain stinks. I remember watching some of those stupid first look docs a while ago, and saw the Strause brothers talking so self assured about the movie they set out to make, that it actually gave me hope that these franchises were on good hands. But now that I saw the movie last night, these two are even more of a fraud that Keiser Soze.It is obvious the pair of brothers are fans of the franchises, but being a fan doesn't make you a fine director to helm such a project. There are several problems: 1) The Strauses are not Scott, not to mention Cameron, they are not even Mc Tiernan nor Hopkins for that matter..their problem though is that they think they are. 2) They thought it was cool to use ""shake cam"" since it is in vogue to do so...the problem is, they used this ""technique"" plus fast cutting edition, in the dark!!. 3) These guys casted the rejected people from an OC secondary role casting, the actors are just plain awful and their characters even more.The result, the action scenes are poorly performed, you cannot make anything out of them, it is gory at moments, then uses a lot of ellipsis, making this boring and childish. It feels like they were having problems of what kind of movie they wanted to make, it fells like a stupid pg-13 movie, then it regrets and turns into an R. Moreover, this movie has the worst editing since the Rollerball remake, it is not paced with style in such a way that you can savor the action scenes. Everything is so fast, dark and poorly shot that you can't get excited about any action shot. And the human plot is ludicrous, why bother...I guess I speak for a lot of fans out there, we want Alien/Predator action...I don't care about the humans, really.The only scene I enjoyed was the reference to Mrs Yutani, it made me smirk and as a good fan of the original series, it felt OK.

I have no idea how this movie got released!First of all, it is so DARK! I was watching it at night with lights off and my screen's brightness turned up to 100%, but it was still so hard to see anything.Second of all, the story is a JOKE! The writing feels so unprofessional! This movie has all of the clichés elements a story could have. With unnecessary romance subplots, excessively cat and mouse shots, it feels like the direction of the plot is going nowhere.Ohhh... I don't even want to mention the acting. People in this movie see this disgusting creature, the Alien, and they talk about it like they've seen a cockroach. The FEAR element isn't portraited properly.Conclusion: I strongly advise you not to watch this movie!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
224,Gezzerboy,I Want My Money Back,3,14 January 2008,On a flying work visit from London to NewYork i got the chance on Sunday to see this film I am am massive fan of the original films with Aliens I would say in my opinion being one of the best films i have ever seen. This i am afraid is not ! Not once during the film did i feel suspense as the director seemed to not want to hide the aliens and had the predator running around like some madman. Why the Predator saw fit to cover his tracks with this blue liquid that melts he evidence then proceed to skin alive one of the poor police officers and hang him on a tree in full view is beyond me. There were to be fair a couple of good moments but these were mostly met with laughter from the audience and not shock or fright. All in all the worst of all them and in my opinion a straight to DVD release.,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
225,antileft,contains some nasty scenes,6,10 January 2008,"It is true that AVP 2 is not exactly a great movie , but nevertheless it does have certain qualities that make it a good B sci-fi flick , namely , it concentrates among other things on Predator and his technology , tactics , and you get a very short glimpse of his home planet , while he even exhibits emotions of , well ,compassion and loss ( a brief scene when he pays salute to his butchered buddies on the alien ship wreckage ) . On the other hand , the film is set in a small town of Gunnison in the middle of large woods ,so that desolation and the fear of the unknown are immediately discernible ,as is the fate that awaits the residents , once the biological reproduction on the largest scale begins ( the scene in the maternity ward represents the climax and is not for the fainthearted , bored or pro-feminists !).

226,jackcwelch23,It's fun. Admit it.,5,13 October 2017,"As dumb as a warehouse full of hammers and as technially inferior to the originals as is seemingly possible. This movie is dribble. I didn't care though. I watched it about six times and there are two things about it that earned It a 5 instead of the 2 it probably deserved. They are as follows:1.) It's so fast paced you have no time to really revel in how bad it is.2.) The fight scenes are cool. Really they are. Come on! Bring out your inner 6 year old and make monster noises and watch the creepy crawly and the outer space pro wrestler bang bang into each other!Apart from that. The rest of it is a bunch of baloney. The dialogue and characters are in one ear and out the other. The story is non existent. But to paraphrase Roger Ebert ""Why would it being a bad movie be enough of a reason not to see it? bad and BORING is why."" I was not bored watching this. But I wasn't as entertained as the idea for this movie should deliver. Still, at least it had the blood and guts that the far worse 2004 one did not. Really, chuck it on on a boring Friday night if you have a big screen and speakers I guarantee you'll at least have a decent time. Let the bad movies have their moment. They don't really deserve it. But let's just be generous to them.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
227,chimera-4,Beverly Hills 90210 guest starring Aliens & Predators! No really!,3,4 February 2008,"Oh boy. Yet again I seem to be writing another scathing review about how the studio's have dressed up a turd in a tried and trusted name in order to line their fat, already diamond studded pockets with more of the little peoples hard earned cash.And wow, this time how so.....Make no mistake, AvP:Reqium makes Paul S.W. Anderson's first entry into the franchise look like a masterpiece. Hell it makes Uwe Boll look like Stanley Kubrik. No doubt about it, this movie simply just should never have been made and whoever greenlit this should be put out of their obvious misery. Of course the term misery here is used in the, very rich due to screwing the movie going public sense of the word.The Alien movies are well known and loved for their relentless action, suspense, set design, kickass monsters, cool vehicles and tech, weapons etc and memorable characters with often cool and quotable dialogue. The Predator movies while not as in your face with some of that stuff were also solid memorable actioners again with cool action heroes and just great entertaining cinema in general. Even the first AvP movie which got so much wrong and dumped all over previously established mythology for both series had plenty of entertainment value even if it just was nowhere near the same league as the original Alien and Predator movies.Here we have what literally feels like an aborted pilot episode of some generic and by the numbers teen drama that someone somewhere figured they could get some use out of by chucking some monsters at it. Not just any monsters, some well loved monsters that would guarantee bums in seats no matter what. Just put enough cool looking bits in it to make the trailer look suitably enticing and we're off...To be fair the movie is competently enough made it's just that the AvP universe was not made to gel with this genre to begin with let alone a lazily scripted seen it all before entry. I'm just so angry at what's happened here (as, it seems, are others here)as I feel this movie could have been so much better. There's tons of AvP material out there that the film makers could have tapped for an infinitely better movie going experience. They probably figured that as long as the movie did what it said on the tin (AvP battles etc) then the rest of the movie doesn't matter.I'd have to say that probably most of the movie indeed doesn't matter and any self respecting AvP fan would do well to either ignore or forget this movie ever existed....And those of you out there thinking ""Well at least we get to see Aliens and Predators on screen going at each other again.""

229,luke-346,Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop making anymore now!!!,2,13 February 2008,"There was a time when the Alien series was a success with even the third installment, Alien 3, showing promise under the guild of a fresh and young David Fincher. The first Predator was a box office hit mainly due to its story, ""in peak"" star Arnold Schwarzenegger and director John McTiernan (Die Hard). The films Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 and Predator were all highly successful and created massive followings among general film fans and science fiction fans alike. Arguably Predator 2 and Alien Resurrection should have signaled the end for both franchises, but studios were undeterred and saw the opportunity to pander to the rumours among fans and combine the two. Step in Paul W.S Anderson, Alien Vs Predator, and now the Brothers Strauss (visual effects graduates, not even directors or writers). The problem was that by allowing such profound and revolutionary creations of the Sci-Fi genre to fall into the hands of firstly a mediocre director and now directorial newbie's has led to nothing more than profanity, epitomised by incompetence. Upon witnessing Alien Vs Predator Requiem (AVPR) die-hard fans will feel sick to their stomachs that this series could have got any worse.One example of the cinematic deterioration of this franchise is in the opening scene and is likely to cause nausea among fans. The film begins with an Alien making its way onto the Predator ship, spurting from the predators chest, growing in to a full grown Predalien and bringing down the Predator craft (which now seems to have far less Predators on it than it did at the end of Alien Vs Predator) and all this occurs with the ship still in Earths atmosphere. Once the ship has crashed AVPR quickly resorts to cheap plot methods and basic narrative conventions, it makes no venture at utilizing any of the twists or subversions served up in the two original films. The wearisome plot progresses with tedious pace, punctuated only by the near rousing conflicts of Alien and Predator and when that runs the risk of boring us we are treated to either an alluring blonde in a bikini or rapid gunfire. AVPR is plagued by an endless array of continuity errors and plot holes with little or no narrative elucidation i.e. members of the public outwitting an elite military unit or the Predator not adhering to laws established in previous editions. This is a film that has a complete disregard for its predecessors, it breaks some of the most fundamental rules of a sequel and in doing so one gets the feeling that it is trying to set itself up as a stand alone feature. Independently the film has no heart, no conviction and no soul and with reference to the other films lacks even the most basic continuity. This is exemplified by the over arching narrative of the film as it undermines the basic premise of the first Alien. Because if the species had been encountered before then those in the first Alien film would have been more proficient and not so ill prepared when encountering them.On a cinematic note the film is close to being dire, I felt urged at some points to shine a torch at the screen, the lighting was so bad. Through utilizing such gloomy and dark effects the audience may feel as though they are being cheated out of some the action  which is ironically its purpose and also indicates the films lack of budget. As with all science fiction one scene normally surfaces as being the most memorable, in this instance it is probably the hospital impregnation scene as it ever so tenuously draws on the themes of the original Alien by literalizing it. The directing is poor, performances weak and the script rotten. AVPR is the product of a conveyor belt system of film-making in which ideas and techniques are assembled by ineffective people and then the finished product distributed among cinemas. This is personified by the absence of gory death scenes and drawn out blood battles because the certification will not allow it  a lower certification achieving a larger target audience. AVPR was purely a business venture and nothing more.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
230,Unicorn-9,Requiem for the Alien franchise,4,18 February 2008,"Unlike many other commentators, I didn't think this was the worst movie ever made, but it did make the original 'Alien vs Predator' look good. The idea wasn't too bad, but the implementation was inept, to say the least.Let's start with the script: there are so many characters that it's hard to keep track of who is who and they're so cardboard that I really couldn't care about them in the least. What good is a horror movie where you don't care whether the characters live or die?Let's continue with the cinematography: much of the movie is so dark that it's almost impossible to see what is going on. The original 'Alien' used darkness well, in this one they apparently couldn't afford to rent enough lights to see anything. They could have saved an awful lot of money by just splicing in an hour of black leader.Let's conclude with the editing: any time that there's any action in the plot, those too-dark-to-see shots are cut together six frames at a time so you can not only not see what's going on but you haven't the faintest clue of what's supposed to be going on. Alien fights Predator, there's a blur of too-dark-to-see shots and then one of them is dead... yeah, that's some way to tell a story.I could go on and point out that it's horribly predictable and they re-use shots which were scary the first time we saw them in earlier movies a decade ago but are just a waste of time today: for example, the skinned human body in the tree. Guys, most of us have seen 'Predator', that's not even remotely a surprise today. But why bother? It's a mess with far worse faults than that.I thought the Alien franchise had sunk to its lowest level when Anderson got the job of directing one, but giving it to a couple of film school students (OK, maybe they're not, I know nothing about their actual movie history and only hope no-one ever lets them near a directing chair again) is really dredging the depths. Maybe Uwe Boll can direct AvP3, that's about the only way they could get worse.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
231,Z21708,Why? Just why?,4,14 August 2019,"If I'm being completely honest, I actually kind of liked the first AVP movie. It's certainly a good popcorn flick, but it's not something to watch for deep, insightful storytelling. Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (I'm just going to call it AVP:R throughout the rest of this review) on the other hand doesn't even succeed as a piece of fun popcorn entertainment.Let me start with one thing: AVP:R is incredibly dark. And I don't mean thematically, I mean you can't see a goddamn thing. You can definitely tell that they have some great Alien and Predator costumes, so why don't they show them in their full glory? The lighting, simply put, is garbage. Nuff said.The first AVP also movie had a much higher budget of 60 million USD. What did AVP:R do? Well, they had a $40 million budget. It honestly feels like every part of this movie had to be approved by some business man in order to make as much money off of this as possible so they could make dozens more sequels.Another thing: the gore. I've heard a lot of people defend the gore in this movie saying ""Well, it's an Alien vs. Predator movie, so of course there's gonna be gore."" In all honesty though, some of the gore is a little much for even an Alien or a Predator movie. We don't need to see a Chestburster come out of a child. We don't need to see the Predalien standing next to a maternity ward, implying that it's gonna eat the babies alive. That's not what we watch these movies for. That's actually pretty disgusting, and I think they went a little overboard there. Aside from the extremely unnecessary shock horror, there's some gore in this movie that's actually pretty good. I like the scene where Jessie gets hit by a smart disc and is pinned to a wall, as well as the scene where Dale gets his face melted off by Xenomorph blood.And I would like to talk about one last thing: the story. The story for AVP:R is a complete mess of cliched characters and completely uninteresting subplots. And about the characters, I hate all of them except for Dallas and the cop. I like them, because they're just trying to help people out and get them to safety. But the rest of the characters are the type of people you'd expect to see in a slasher film or some generic small town alien invasion film. Actually, that's all that AVP:R is. An extremely generic small town alien invasion flick with Aliens and Predators thrown in. Let's think about what all the previous Alien and Predator movies had in terms of characters. Alien had refinery workers on a space tug, Aliens had heavily armed space marines, Predator had Commandos in the jungles of Central America, Predator 2 had Danny Glover playing a cop, Alien 3 had religious inmates, Alien Resurrection had mercenaries, AVP had scientists in the Antarctic, and AVP:R haa a bunch of teenagers that just kind of happen on Alien and Predator stuff.What more can I say about this movie? It's awful. It's bad for newcomers to both franchises and bad for longtime fans of Alien and Predator.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

I seen this thing 28 mins after it started... for some strange reason... (call it an inkling or whatever, but...) I doubt I missed anything spectacular.The action sequences in this have to be the most badly filmed and executed ever for one movie. The camera and lighting is totally f'cked too. It's impossible to see who attacked who, what killed what. At times the cinematography is so bad you begin to giggle (at least I did :/ ) The human characters also have as much character as a single cell amoeba. Not one iota of emotion of humanity is evident in them the likes of which was portrayed in the vulnerable Ripley of the 1st 2 Alien movies. I cannot begin to express my disgust for this thing...There's a scene where this dude and this chick are about to swim in this pool at night, then the local bullies come to break up the happy union- aliens do come into the pool... BUT, the cinematogrpahy was so bad I can't remember if they got killed or not. In fact, I can't call recall a single scene in my mind from this thing (I re frame from using 'movie' cuz it is non deserving), IT WAS THAT BAD.When this thing ended (the government drops a bomb on the town, annihilating everything, and the human characters, if you wanna call em that escape in plane) I had to question what the f**k I had just seen. I've walked away from gross out teen sex comedies that have left me feeling more satisfied than this! Seriously, it's not worth your time watching, honestly, you'll just come to the same conclusions I did. The only reason you have to watch it is to reinforce what I've already stated here today.

The video store had tons of films on sale and snagged it thinking it was the other AVP.As I watched the film, clearly it didn't have A-list actors but was really surprised. It didn't feel cheap in anyway, and the follow through is good.When it comes to plot lines, you can say that it was average. Most films whether they be first class or B-Films have for the most part a rather basic plot line. In pirates - Dead man- everyone is looking for the Heart, Transformers, OK well we're looking for a cube, and in most cases when being attacked by alien foe we are trying to escape. I've read over many reviews and Im surprised that people have been going on and on about the plot. Come on its just a fun kick back entertaining story. It isn't a ""beautiful mind"" and when I want to watch that kind of film... well... I put in a ""Beautiful Mind"" I decided to leave a comment about this film cause for the most part people love to rip into the folks that make these films. And for people who probably never made a film sure do have a lot to say about how to do things the right way. Sure it seems like everyone was kicking back and having nothing but fun, but from working on a set myself Im pretty sure it was a battle like anything else. Lots and lots of work goes into producing a movie, so lets cut them a little slack. :) So onto the complements to the folks that made this film. First of all, it was a really good film, the effects were flawless, the actors were pretty solid for the most part, I felt killing a kid was a little too over the top but hey we cant sugar coat reality can we. Aliens don't care one way or the other, food is food. I thought that the Hybrid alien was really awesome especially in its design and how well it performed. What ever poor actor that had to sit in that suit cooking the whole time day in and day out did a really good job cause it felt authentic. And to those that commented about how they looked, lets be honest they looked a lot better than the first alien. Though its hard to get over the first one so enough trying to compare I suppose.For those who love Sci-Fi, I got to say I was really really impressed with the film, its worth renting or even buying.

All you should be interested in is getting a lot of Alien/Predator action, maybe some cool pictures and perhaps a little suspense. That would be fine.AVP1 did just right that. A straight forward story, not too much of it of course, cool pictures and a bit of cool action. And it was not a standard teenage horror movie. Nice.AVP2 does not even reach that level! It is almost a teenage horror movie. Yes OK, some teenagers get killed. Even some of those characters that usually survive. But I definitely do not want to see something like that in an Alien and/or Predator film.And even more disappointing: it is a lot of aliens versus ONE (and only one) predator. No real battle of the monsters here.And the worst: somehow the filmmakers thought it would be good idea, to change the Alien-design! So they created one Predalien, a mix of -well- Alien and Predator. That sure is no match for the original H.R. Giger design.This results in action scenes where it is right out impossible to tell which dark body is Alien and which is Predator. And that's another weakness. In AVP1 some of the fights were extremely well filmed. In AVP2 each and every fight has to be fast and hard, dark, full of rain, unrecognizable action in the end. Very bad! AVP2 is just a teenage horror film, bending the rules of this sub-genre at times.

This time they're infesting a small American town! But it's worse than that - much worse. This time they're - lazy! Seriously, this has to be one of the laziest, most uninspired sequels I've ever seen. The characters are stock clichés - the overburdened sheriff who never calls for backup, the nice but nerdy kid, the slutty girl, the school bullies, and so on and on. None of them is a protagonist, which means that we don't have anyone to lead us through the story.Not that this really matters, since the story consists of: people are attacked by aliens. People are eaten. More people are attacked by aliens. Repeat until closing credits. Alien, Aliens and Predator built up suspense, and had resourceful heroes trying to fight back against the monsters, even if the odds were impossible. There's none of that here. Bland non-characters are attacked and immediately eaten. That's all you're getting, over and over again.Even that action is barely visible, because for some reason (to disguise cheap special effects?) the whole thing is shot in near darkness. On the rare occasions that you can make something out through the gloom, your response is likely to be 'Who's that? Oh, never mind, he just got eaten. Oh, it's gone dark again'.The sum total of links to the other movies is that there's a character called Dallas.

240,PenOutOfTime,"How Aliens vs Predator - Requiem, fails.",4,28 May 2008,"There are two really great ways of setting up a monster movie.The first puts a small cast in an isolated environment with the monster, and sets the monster to hunting the people. This setup justifies a great variety of plot twists, as the cast go to great lengths to defeat/escape-from the monster. The first, and great ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" movies use this setup.The second approach, typified by ""Jaws"", turns a monster loose upon a community. This setup does not justify such convoluted individual actions by the human cast, and much of the drama is drawn from watching the reaction of the society (classically skepticism and cover-up) to the threat. There is a variant of this plot, typified by ""Godzilla"" that throws the monster in the face of the public, and has lots of crowd attack scenes, but does not rely on the monster being a secret.""Aliens vs Predator - Requiem"" fails in no small part because it fails to fully live up to either of these two major premises. The alien attacks a community, with the predator in pursuit, pointing towards the second monster movie premise, but there is never much tension as to the society's reaction to the threat.The way that a comparatively small cast is brought together within this large environment is relatively realistic, in horror movie terms, but the viewer never cares about either this small group, or the human characters in general.The makers of ""Aliens vs Predator - Requiem"", clearly presume that lifting the violence cap, and making an ""R"" rated film will add excitement to the film. For lovers of gore, this may be an improvement, but most viewers will find the violence pointless. I have seen very few films with as little tension in the action scenes. Fight scenes between two combatants are also extremely dull and unimpressive, and the crowd attack scenes are the worst that I can remember. Basic plot choices are refreshingly unsentimental, one of the few plusses for this film, but most of the gore scenes are not necessary to achieve this effect.To sum up, this film is a failure. Better acting would have helped a bit, as the cast seemed as if it were lifted from a cheap daytime soap opera, but the direction is probably the worst thing about this movie. The premise was flawed from the start, but even so, the movie had a lot more potential than we see here.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

242,knuckles_and_sonic,2nd Disappointment this year,6,13 January 2008,AVP1 was enjoyable and a solid 8/10. Its sequel however isn't so great. For a start the movie isn't that easy to follow. This is due to terrible lighting....whoever did this should be shot. Secondly the movie didn't flow. Despite this it was still entertaining just not great. What they need to do is make a movie in the same vein as Predator 2...the humans in this movie (AVPR) are silly and we don't care if they die or not. Also a lot of the gore wasn't shown which was a shame in my opinion. This is the second disappointment after I Am Legend this year and I really don't see why Hollywood can't make a good sequel for once (SAW series aside).

So I anxiously awaited this movie and after hearing about the R rating and seeing the red band trailer, I was giddy as a school girl! Unfortunately missed it at theaters, but just watched it on DVD and I must say it blows the first out of the water for sure!Where do I begin with why this was so awesome? Well, the gore that was missed in the first movie is back! The aliens show no mercy at all! I mean, frickin' children and pregnant woman are victims of them! Oh yeah they went there! And some nice juicy acid alien blood on a victim's face! Next? New territory! OK, the Predators have been in a city before, but FINALLY we get to see the aliens down on Earth and in a city! (too bad we couldn't get that supposed sequel after Resurrection that was supposed to be on Earth, oh well). This creates many awesome situations, such as aliens in a sewer, aliens in a swimming pool, and aliens in a hospital! Oh and of course, the Predalien! Mean sucker he is! The only thing is I would've liked to see more Predalien vs human action. Oh well.So maybe not the best in the Alien series or the Predator series, it is definitely the sweetest AVP movie!

We Get A Lot Of New Faces To Play All The Human Characters In The Colorado Town, But They No Nothing. The Acting Is Horrible, The Interest Level Is Very Low When The Predator Or Alien Or Hybrid Creature are Not On Screen, and The Plot Of The Government Getting Involved Was Seen A Mile Away. Only When The Creatures Are On Screen Does This Movie Get Interesting and There Be Plenty Of Blood & Gore. It's Great To See The Predator Back In The Forest Setting Hunting and Killing Whoever Gets In His Way Like In the Original PREDATOR Movie. Same Can Be Said For The Aliens, It's Great To See Many Aliens Go For The Prey and Kill, and the Infamous Chest-Bursting Alien Moments Like In ALIENS.

246,gelmcchristop,At least it looked good,6,14 September 2021,"I mean it looked pretty awesome. The grain, the fog, the crunched blacks and extreme contrast all created an excellent horror atmosphere. The concept art too was great, and they pretty much nailed the xenomorph designs, getting it as cohesive as possible with Giger's original one.But the merits of the movie end there. The story is extremely hollow. A bunch of mainstream characters are thrown at the audience's face within the first five minutes just to be killed off slowly without any arc development and consequently no emotional impact whatsoever. The kill sequences are pretty well-directed and frightening, but what dies is ultimately some random person whose name you probably won't remember before the final credits are over.Overall it makes me appreciate the Alien prequels even more, and despite improving on the visuals of AVP it is in fact a much less intriguing script. It can definitely be a great watch for the horror fanbase, but beyond that, it just doesn't feel worth the watch.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

It will just be a mindless gore-fest! If you have seen the previous alien/predator movies but you're not a fan: If you didn't like the previous ones you should probably avoid this one - you will die! If you have seen the previous alien/predator movies and you're a fan: Stay clear of this one cause you will wanna kill the Strause brothers (directors) for raping the Alien/Predator universe and legacy.If you've had your brain removed and gets off on gore: Be careful that there is no residue left of your brain cause it might then hurt from all the sucking this movie does.I personally am a fan of the first two alien movies as well as the first predator one, although I have suffered through all the spinoffs and sequels. When watching this one I realized this movie sucked big-time during the opening scene but I was amazed after ten minutes that they had a suck-level of 100%! It wasn't that the scenes were no good  they genuinely sucked. They actually sucked so hard I had to hold on to things.The dialogue must be randomly picked from a hat filled with all the lines from all the teenage slasher movies à la Friday the Thirteenth. There are more plot holes and logic gaps than craters on the moon. But worst of all is how they abuse the Alien and Predator universe and the ""natural laws"" that has been built up so far. The whole movie is just a mish-mash of semi-coherent scenes. The fact that special effects aren't horrible doesn't outweigh any of the negatives.To sum it up  unless you need gore to survive and this is the only movie left on your deserted island, stay away from this piece of sheit!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

My wife and I both found it a fun roller coaster ride.The basic premise was excellent, a small town that is accidentally invaded by a plague of lethal acid bleeding aliens from a Predator ship who use humans as host for their reproduction including a new alien/predator hybrid, and the alien Predator who comes to town to clean up the mess his species accidentally created and to hide the evidence of extraterrestrial activity from the humans.Watching the growing infestation of the aliens was fascinating. And watching the determination of the alien Predator to wipe them out was equally fascinating.Sure the humans in this movie were merely carnage for the alien vs. predator war, but I also found that interesting.

251,mejaflora,A horribly disappointing sequel!,1,28 March 2008,"After following all the Alien movies, and AVP1 religiously, I had seriously high hopes for AVP2. But within the first 30 minutes, I was left with what the huh, who the what? Were those just a couple of teenagers trying to make out in an AVP movie? That may not be the first kiss in the Alien movies, Ripley has had a couple of love moments but they were adult and contained more class than a couple of horny teenagers can convey. There just isn't any place for teenage tongue fights in the AVP franchise! What were they thinking? With that done, you kind of waited and waited for the movie to start showing us its direction but after an hour or so, you realized there isn't one. There is no point, no style and no new moments to surprise you. The gore was short-lived and the violence were minimized. The humans scatter around talking about getting guns etc without having any real idea on what they're fighting against. It wasn't like the Aliens were swarming like bees or anything, they were pretty sneaky. And teenagers with guns? Seriously this movie gave a lot of hero worship to young guns. its fine if they deserved it and showed maturity beyond their years but weren't they just a moment ago tonguing each other, starting up fights over a girl they called a slut. those are the bunch we want saving the world.And last but not least, why just one predator! against all these aliens, he seemed pretty out of his league. I kept waiting for him to start calling some backup.All in all, a disappointing movie, without any redeeming qualities filled with unknowns trying to become movie stars and definitely won't be, bad dialog all around, unbelievable fight scenes and I mean you can't believe it's a fight scene. One time I thought the alien was trying to kiss the predator left cheek then right cheek before the predator was like pulling its face off.

252,symbioticpsychotic,The Most Average of the Average,5,1 February 2008,"In all honesty, I wasn't actually expecting all that much from this movie, and by the looks of it, the film makers weren't expecting all that much either.There has been no effort put in to any part of this film, making it entirely a 'by the numbers' movie.Fairly average script, nothing special, but nothing really terrible. Extreme close ups of the actions scenes, making it near impossible to see said action. Stupid goofy mean people that can be used as fodder to be killed off. A ridiculous amount of 'homages' to the rest of the franchise, primarily Aliens (to the point where the Reiko Aylesworth's kid has an English accent, despite living in America and being brought up by an All American Dad). No real action starting until nightfall (in a town without power) so you really can't see anything. Most alien action taking place either off camera, or through diffused pov's like rain washed windows. Not one but TWO massive explosions at the beginning of the movie that NO ONE even notices. Explosions in the middle of town that people drive past without noticing. Stupid Sheriff. Stupid Ex-Con who will go on to prove himself and therefore be able to make a valid contribution to society. Slutty blonde chick who gets killed off way too late. LOTS of CGI. Silly throw away tie-in Yutani reference at the end. Complete lack of realistic actions from the Predator, Aliens and Humans. And so on....Although, I never realized how good Reiko Aylesworth's body was until this film. It has that much going for it.Oh, and I rolled my eyes so much during the film that I thought it should have been called AVPRE (Alien Versus Predator Rolling Eyes).Balls!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
253,DrLex,Pulp,5,23 February 2008,"This movie is actually enjoyable, if you approach it from the right direction. It is enjoyable in the same kind of way that most Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme movies can be enjoyable: you know from the start that they will have an inane plot, bad acting, and lots of silly but entertaining fight scenes. But still, some people want to watch that kind of stuff sometimes because it's fun. This movie is no different. If you are unable to appreciate movies like that, by all means stay away from it!AvP-Requiem has as much to do with Aliens and Predators as Mickey Mouse has to do with Freddy Krueger. The characters are there, but only in a severely brain-dead form. Their only goal in this film seems to be to fight each other endlessly and when they're bored, make people die in all kinds of gruesome ways. It is not a horror movie, because one can see when something bad is going to happen from miles away. Like most attempts at horror movies nowadays, the movie tries to rely on gore and graphic violence but it even fails at that because everything is so exaggerated that it becomes funny instead. Really the only reason why one should watch AvP-Requiem is to watch people and aliens die, because that is about the only thing that happens in it.This movie screams ""low budget"" at the top of its lungs. Funny enough, its budget is slightly higher than of the second Predator movie, but the effects are not much better despite 17 years of advances in film-making since then. This is often masked by making everything dark and blurry, and by shaking the camera around so nobody has time to see how bad the effects are (or what is actually happening). The graphics in some PC games are better than the few full-scale CGI scenes at the start of the movie.Overall, in spite of its budget there is a real ""B-movie"" feel to 'Aliens vs Predator - Requiem', and in fact that is just what it is. Bring out the popcorn!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
254,gallae,Enjoyable but predictable,6,1 January 2008,"It was just the film I needed - it had a predictable amount of suspense, a now clichéd bunch of set pieces and interesting visual effects.There's also a definite progression in it from the first outing Aliens vs. Predator. That film had a small number of humans, small number of aliens, and small number of predators in it, all in an environment designed for hunting. This one features a larger number of aliens and the town of Gunnison, Colorado, and less Predators.I liked how the film drew on the existing mythology of the previous Alien films. There's a ""Ripley"" and a ""Newt"" type characters, and another character is named ""Dallas"" (with a beard too, who, well you can guess). And there are also some soldiers who get massacred, a bit like Aliens. There really aren't any recurring characters from the previous film though, which is not surprising considering that only one survived it! But there are other characters that you know are potential ""victim material"" and part of the fun is waiting to see who survives and who doesn't. Don't get me wrong, but while this movie is suspenseful, I didn't find it that scary at all. The first two Alien films still scare me, even though I've seen them numerous times.I really like those films too, because Ripley develops as a character and by the end of the second film, conquers (literally) her demons. The third film Alien3 just seemed to flush that all away. I never watched Alien Resurrection or the first AvP film in the cinema, having at that point given up on them.With this film there were few surprises, just variations on a theme - who dies and who doesn't (golly, who saw that the Bully was going to cop it?) and what shape the main alien's going to be this time. There are some serious gross scenes in the film, especially those with a pregnant woman in them. The ending is clearly meant to lead into the next film (""Aliens vs Predator : Revival""?) and/or explain why the Aliens weren't common knowledge by Ripley's time.I suspect that for this film, too much detail (how often do we have to see an Alien's tongue rip a brain out?) is actually less as far as content goes. In none of the films so far have we seen how a Queen is made and I was rather hoping to see that - pity.There was an odd processed quality about the cinematography too. Everything looked more grainy than it ought to be, though this seemed to work well overall. There are one or two scenes at the start where two characters talking almost seemed to be doing so in front of a back-screen project. Probably an illusion, though there also hints that this might have meant to be a 3D film as well.Still, a bit of mindless fun, and quite suited to New Year's Day.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Alien vs Predator: Requiem is a detestable piece of sh*t! Terrible on every level, this can't even be classed in the so-bad-it's-good category. Nope, it's just bad, seriously bad. It's the final nail in the coffin for these once great cinematic monsters. The Aliens are just doing there thing so i can't comment on them too much but the Predator and the horrifically bad Predalien are just terrible. The Predator is the most inept and retarded creature to grace the screen. He's so careful and meticulous about covering his tracks yet feels the need to skin a state trooper for all to find. Go figure. And don't even get me started on the Predalien. Lets just say it makes the Alien/Human hybrid at the end of Alien Resurrection look truly terrifying.I hated this film, flat out loathed it. I expected the acting, script, pacing to be bad but not on this level. You can't even see what the hell's going on the lighting's so bad. The only decent moment comes when the attractive blond girl get impaled to the wall. But other than that, don't waste your time.

Not a lot.The trailer gave me high hopes, then IMDb reviewers told me how it is.I'd say this is better than AVP purely for the reason that there's more action and gore....these 2 ingredients alone are not enough to save us though. It's all been down hill from day 1. The moment Fox optioned AVP we waved goodbye to Alien 5 (Scott and Cameron...oh what could have been) or Predator 3. It's worth reminding yourself that AVP films are side products....don't include them in the respective franchises as they were never intended to be continuations. AVPR has a very brightopening 5 minutes which could have have taken the film into a very good story. Unfortunately no-one (script writers/directors) noticed and we are left with an empty feeling again as yet another opportunity goes flying by. At least this time around we get to see more violence as the Predator takes out the Aliens...but it's just not done with any style or heart (or light!) and we get a nice blosh of AVP madness on screen in our faces but without any 'cool' or 'wow' factor. This film neither satisfies fans of the series or those of us who just want to see two top Stan Winston designs go against each other. Nice to see 2 TV peeps that I watch in the cast (24, Rescue Me) but I didn't appreciate the whole 'let's try and create a Ripley and Newt bond whilst playing the original soundtrack.....but with new actors' thing.

257,imajestr,Should have gone straight to video,1,26 December 2007,"The dialogue was some of the worst writing I've had to sit through in a while. None of the characters are likable or realistic. There isn't even really a protagonist. This movie's the culmination of two fanboy minds intent on making a mindless gorefest by intermingling two franchises that became garbage about 20 years ago.There's no tension throughout the movie because none of the characters matter. We're introduced to some characters that would fit perfectly well in a made for TV slasher flick, and these somehow become the characters we're forced to follow. I say ""forced"" because I did not want to see any more of these characters when they were first introduced. And it seemed like every time a new character was introduced that character died thirty seconds later.And since a great deal of the deaths are in the R rated trailer, I already knew who was going to die and when. In fact, the trailers show the overall plot in about a minute and a half anyway. They even show a plane dropping a nuke. Why film companies like to spoil movie plots before people even see them is beyond me, and it certainly ruins the movie going experience when you know one of the main plot points before it happens.The main monsters, the Predator and the Predalien, are the only two things the movie has going for it, but they still aren't enough. They get a decent amount of screen time, but the climax feels strikingly absent by the time the credits roll.The best way to describe the movie in its entirety is to say that it feels like an hour and a half of filler. By the end you're still waiting for the plot to get going, but it just never does. Aliens descend on town, Predator descends on aliens, a bunch of people die. And all of the main characters feel like side characters. What makes a good monster movie is having someone to root for, but that someone is entirely absent in this movie. For some reason the writers decided it best to make the human's dramatic side plot about a high school boy who likes a slutty blonde girl who, surprise, even has a big bully boyfriend who likes to beat up the nice boy with the crush. But none of it is convincing in the least. I found myself stifling laughter throughout the movie.If you want a newer, more enjoyable monster movie, watch something like The Descent or maybe go see The Mist, but don't waste your time or money sitting through this new disgrace to the Alien and Predator franchises. It really seems like it should have been made for a sci fi channel release.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

They knew what they were going for and managed to get a somewhat decent film out of this - There is no denying that both the Predator and the Predalien are the stars of the show here, which is actually a first in all franchises associated with this film. - All the characters are very 1 dimensional- not incredibly cheesy like the first one(which is a good thing), but bland as hell. I did not give a rats ass about what happened to these characters, which is a shame due to the memorable characters both sides gave us in the past.The Directors fascination with offing pregnant women and their babies is disturbing. One instance would've been OK and terrifying, but they decide to outdo themselves and have it happen 3-5 times. - The lil gov't/Yutani nonsense was a waste of time, it went over 99 % of the audience's heads.All in all, I would say this is worth checking out as far as fans of either series go. Both combstants are used very well. Just don't expect the character driven greatness of the past to return. I just can never see that being pulled off as long as AVP goes.

262,gundognc,Quite possibly the greatest kids movie of all time,5,7 September 2009,"AvP2: Requiem with a Vengeance is probably the best all-round family film of the decade, children will be entranced by the sickening violence and relentless gore, adults will enjoy the more philosophical questions surrounding how many aliens can burst from the belly of a pregnant woman.This a film made by people who had a theoretical understanding of what constitutes a horror film and wanted absolutely no part of it. AvP2: The Phantom Requiem is, I think, the most calculatingly gratuitous film I have ever seen. There is an unwritten code in American film making that you don't off kiddies unless it is an essential part of the story. AvP2: The Requiem of the King kills its first child 5 minutes 11 seconds in, letting you know that no prisoners are going to be taken.Spoiler You could almost forget the spoiler. ""It does what it says on the tin"" would be an adequate description of the film. Nonetheless...The pred-alien last seen bursting from the chest of our erstwhile (which means former) protagonist (which means hero) at the end of AvP goes wild on the predator mothership and causes it to crash in a small mountain town in one of the more foresty American states. Oregon or something like that I would imagine. Face-huggers are all over the shop and before you can say ""generic plot"" the place is crawling with the tooth-tounged drooling ones.On (what I assume is the) Predator homeworld a predator gets a text message saying that he should head off to Earth for some merry alien hunting. Or maybe he's a pest control expert. Possibly he works for Rent-o-kill IN SPACE. Or something.I cannot help wondering about the Predators. They've built a machine age civilization far in advance of our own. What's the hunting about? Are the predators we see in the various films sort of hyper-tech rednecks metaphorically off in their pick up truck for a bit of beer and deer? Or is it some sort of holiday? Are they all bored star-accountants and future-lawyers off on the space equivalent of a safari? Who knows or, quite probably, cares? Back in Onanism, Montana (or something) the story unfolds as a young man with an improbably hot girlfriend starts noticing that strange things are happening. Pred-o-kill arrives and soon enough there's a river of acid blood running everywhere.Michelle Dessler (who obviously joined the army after faking her death in 24) comes home to see her husband and annoying child. She gives her daughter a night vision scope to play with and soon enough the kid spots an alien in the garden. This leads to one of the most epic moments in film history. Mummy and daddy run into the room. Child says ""there's a monster in the garden"" (they mostly come at night, mostly... apparently). Daddy walks over to the window says ""honey there are no monsters"" and gets eaten. It's brilliant. It's as if director had heard of A SUSPENSE but had never actually seen one in the wild.The national guard is called in and gets comprehensively mupped. The townsfolk gather in the centre of town for a famous last stand and wait for the cavalry – unaware that the government plan to assist them WITH A NUKE! Michelle and co head for the hospital and its chopper where they discover that the pred-alien's been breeding by vomiting alien embryos down the throats of women in the maternity ward. The phrase ""beyond sickening"" doesn't begin cover it. I've seen some unpleasantness in my time but this rates an 11 on the Nasty-scale. Inevitably the pred-alien and the predator have it out in a big throwing-each-other-through-stuff fight before our heroes escape.End Spoiler This is a film to be avoided. Seriously, it'll warp you, I guarantee it. Be wary of anyone who says that they enjoyed it, they've gone wrong.Having said that, I rather enjoyed this film. Granted the gore made Bad Taste look like a rather tame episode of The Antiques Roadshow but you've got to give the film makers credit for only missing the point by a couple of galaxies. The strange thing is that AvP2: Requiems of the Lost Ark is that it has good special effects and some competent acting on the part of the main leads.WATCH AT YOUR PERIL",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
263,siit,AvP meets Friday the 13th,6,25 December 2007,"It becomes so noticeable that the Strause Brothers took every most memorable aspect of both the Predator and Alien franchises, and melded them into AvP:R, Ergo, looks, sounds, music and atmosphere. And on a certain level it works very very well. It seemed a conglomeration of all the best aspects from all the movies, from the opening sound of the motion tracker...Anyway... The setting is immediately after the first AvP. Sure there are massive plot holes for example how did the new Predator arrive so quickly? But thats OK. The scenes in the forest were very reminiscent of the original Predator and funnily enough, the Rambo:First Blood forest hunting feel.The story overall was very interesting. Uncontrollable outbreak of an Alien infestation and the reaction of town, local police, National Guard and ultimately the Government. Problem is, it felt rushed. For 104mins, it could have been fleshed out more. The pace was frenetic for the most, but seemed 'too' fast in places. I felt that they could have taken at least one or two more shots to en capture the emotional state of the characters when the realisation of their final predicament was upon them, ergo the holed-up townsfolk, the escaping people, doctors at the hospital etc. I believe that the movie would have been far superior if they allowed certain characters to be fleshed out more and in general adjust the pacing. Movies nowadays tend to be over the 2 hour mark, AvP:R needed it.The gore factor was definitely upped to near maximum, but I believe the Strause Brothers have upped the ante by showing the realism of horror impacting children, and dare I say babies! I was reminded of the Friday the 13th movies of the innovative ways in which to see victims eviscerated.The resultant 'alien' from ending of AvP was interestingly nasty and there will be countless debates comparing the pure Queen in a Mano-DE-Mano (well the female equivalent) with the Pred Alien.Apart from the already mentioned collection of 'best of' bits from the two franchises, it will be apparent to the hard core fans that the Strause Brothers are real fans. You will notice clever references to the Aliens V Predator novels (Prey and Hunter's Planet) of 'Dachande' (Yeyinde) and the striking similarity of Noguchi. All that was missing was Ne'dtessei written on the outside of the Predator ship :) The Cinematic release was a decent offering. I am hoping that there is a Director's Cut version on the DVD release that addresses the pacing. Fans of the franchises will be pleased, in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this movie is the catalyst for a movement to create another Alien movie based on the 'fans wanted' Earth being taken over by Aliens.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
264,jamiecfc1,Ummm,6,20 January 2008,"I had pretty low expectations for this film, having seen the previous one... Then I saw some of the trailers and thought it may not be as bad as that, and I was right.. it wasn't. It had some good moments in it, some nasty deaths (both by Alien and Predator) and the usual B-movie shonky acting and a plot so full of holes you could have flown a spaceship through it. However.. the thing that I can't understand is why, having been directed by 2 FX ""experts"", the fight scenes between A & P were so poorly shot. Yes I know they were in the rain, and the dark, but the overall effect just left me confused about who was doing what to who. I have no doubts whatsoever there will be (yet) another sequel, whether lessons will be learnt and either of these 2 ""franchises"" will produce a film worthy of the ones that first spawned them, I severely doubt.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
265,NikTesla,What a pile of garbage.,1,25 February 2009,"This movie is a complete pile of garbage. The idiots that ""wrote"" the ""script"" clearly have not seen any of previous Alien or predator movies. Having the =alien that formed from the chestburster that came out of the predator was laying multiple embryos in each human. No encapsulation to be exposed to a facehugger. Multiple chestbursters from each human. And the movie had the ""atmospherics"" of a sweaty armpit. The only good things about this movie was that it ended and that I did not pay anything to see it in the cinema. But it is and hour and a half of my life that I will never see again.I just hope the AVP franchise has been killed off by this squalid lump of trash. It is just a shame that it was two films too long.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
266,Magellan Grey,Christmas and outlandish violence against infants and women in labor.,4,2 January 2008,"This film is an atrocity! Either Shane Salerno has an innate hatred against infants, children and pregnant women in labor or its the two directors. Another thing is that this film was released on Christmas day which is the celebration of the Christ child birth. The film is loaded with the outrageous killing of newborns in the hospital nursery and the killing of infants in the womb just moments away from being born. The first atrocity was the face-hugger attack on what appears to be an 8 year old boy and the creature bursting out. HOW DARE THEY DO THIS!!! But when the attack happened in the hospital nursery and the later quick glimpse of the blood splattered area then the attack upon pregnant women, this was the destruction of any credibility the film and the filmmakers had! This film really deserves a big zero, because that is what it is worth. I gave it a 4 rating because the idea of the alien creature escaping into a small town was interesting, but the film turned out extremely bad...The filmmakers and Mr. Salerno should be subjected to intense psychological evaluation for the atrocities perpetrated here and especially on Christmas which is the second holiest day on the Christian Calendar behind Easter. Let these men try some mess like this concerning Mohammed on Ramadan... Guaranteed they would wind up dead in a ditch somewhere.This film was AWFUL!!!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
267,lmahesa,I don't understand the hate.,8,15 November 2020,"I've just re-watched this after coming across Stuckmann's review, and I just don't understand it.I thought it was great, with homages to both Aliens and Predator. Yes, the sheriff buddies up to the 'criminal' Dallas... but they were best friends in their youth, and it was clear that the reason he was in prison was a point of contention. The sheriff himself had been arrested before. This was all made clear when Dallas was first picked up by the sheriff.As for the dark scenes - I had no problem. These creatures weren't meant to be shown in daylight, as was evidenced by 2018's The Predator.The hospital scenes? Totally appropriate. That's what would happen in a scenario like this. Bed-ridden patients are easy pickings.The only issues I had with this movie were the aliens gestating so quickly and the Predator taking out civilians, though I would chalk that up to a degree of desperation on his part to clean the scene... but then he should have just nuked the site upon arrival, but that wouldn't make a good movie.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

269,stefrance99,speechless,3,18 February 2008,"It's not because you are brothers (Brothers Stauss) that you are genius (Brothers Cohen). Yet they did manage to keep a certain level of adrenaline pumped into the movie, hence the 3 I give to AVPR.The people that should be included in the slaughter on the other hand is writer: Shane Salerno (written by) May be he watched too many episodes of Dawson Creeks, but his inspiration for the dialogues was really lame and he created the dumbest Predator in History, it's barely believable to see him survive longer than the first encounter with Alien warriors.How can he only find out Aliens when they are in plain sight or be sneaked upon by mere human. Isn't he supposed to have powerfully enhanced helmet with lots of gizzmos and prisms for him to be fully aware of its surrounding?It's also annoying to see how in recent movies time is being played with, from the original Alien where it takes at least 48h if not more to have a fully grown Alien Warrior, to AVPR where it takes less than 6h and they are universe champions at secreting their typical organic wall... a full corridor in a couple hours, woow, it's really annoyingAt least they did not try to pretend there was a plot behind the movie, the Predator comes to clean the mess, but can't manage (cause he is such a dumbass), the Aliens start slaughtering the humans and it gets messy and gory so the human nuke the site to contain all that mess.The only satisfaction and what makes the movie better than the previous one is that the Aliens are in a total bloodlust and the action goes on at a good pace maintained by the director...But this is by no means a good movie at all",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

But a teenage boy would say ""Dude, this is like the coolest frigging movie of all time!"". I am still in my teen years and I enjoyed this immensely (a lot more than the original). But there is hardly a storyline to follow, cardboard performances and who was in charge of the screenplay? I have never seen so much crappy dialogue in a film. But there is action aplenty and brilliant fight scenes between the two species of monsters.AVPR 6.1 out of 10.

271,BruddanChrist,20th Century Fox misses the mark yet again.,4,5 March 2008,"The fighting between the Predator and the Aliens in AVPR is a significant improvement from AVP, though it still lacks imagination. There's only one Predator facing off against a handful of Aliens, which severely limits the amount of butt-kicking going on in any given scene. Said butt-kicking is, however, much cooler and more frequent this time around.The story is where AVPR falls flat on its back. Why the writer felt the need to limit a brutal struggle between two mammoths of sci-fi action to a small town in middle America is far beyond my understanding. The Dawson's Creek subplot involving a kid and the girl he's interested in feels irrelevant next to the overall conflict and ultimately adds nothing to the movie.Brian Tyler's explosively epic score adds a lot of weight to the movie, giving it a much sharper edge than AVP. It's a wonderful blend of Alan Silvestri's Predator music and the various Alien themes while establishing its own sound. It's definitely the part of AVPR that works the most.20th Century Fox's second cinematic translation of the Aliens Vs. Predator concept was a shot in the dark after their first attempt failed. Unfortunately, nobody knows where that shot went. I can just imagine the studio execs at Fox looking at AVPR disappointedly and saying, ""Well, at least we made SOME profit."" It's a shame if that is indeed the case since they don't seem to realize the awesome potential of a good AVP movie. AVP could have been the movie of the decade, but they blew it by giving it to Paul W.S. Anderson. AVPR should have been their post-wake up call reboot, but it came out as the expensive idle pleasure of a couple of Hollywood newcomers.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
272,thebrighteyes,Enjoyable if you can ignore the gaping plot holes.,5,14 May 2008,"Alien Vs. Predator: Requiem is a sequel to a movie based on a video game based on two different movie franchises. I don't think I have to mention that I thought this was going to be a 1/10 (or 3/10 at the very most). I was surprised.But it did have its flaws.For the whole first half of the movie, the predator had this blue liquid which made people, aliens, and other stuff disintegrate. And he kept pouring over everything, presumably to cover his tracks.Why would he care about covering his/the aliens' tracks? Also, in other parts of the movie, he would just kill people and not bother at all with the clean-up. And why would he use spears and whips to kill his aliens, when he could have just put this blue liquid in some sort of water gun or something - seems like it would make a better weapon. There is some sort of discontinuity here.The movie also suffers from the cliché action movie issues. For example, the aliens/predator have no problem killing droves of people, but for some reason are completely inept at killing any of the main characters. Also, most of the acting was pretty terrible during the non-action scenes.And finally, the whole concept - the whole reason the predator was on Earth hunting aliens - didn't make much sense. Though, I feel like the writer(s) just did the best with the concept they were given.But if you can get past these plot holes (or whatever you want to call them), the movie was pretty decent and the special effects/costumes were amazing. The action scenes were pretty good, and a few of the characters were compelling (the pizza delivery boy).",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Even the most hardcore Alien/Predator fan like myself will hate this. To take the greatest monsters with all there elegance to a teen slasher film is possibly the worst production idea ever, who the hell green lit the script.
I love teen slashers, but theses worlds don't exist together. Absolute junk, the directors should be ashamed to have screwed with it in such a demeaning fashion. And the exposure is so dark you can't see anything anyway, which I guess is a good thing. I quite literally wanted everyone to die so I could stop seeing this abomination.

274,david-robin,happily surprised,7,20 April 2011,"This film is taking action a few seconds after ""Aliens Vs Predator"" (2004) directed by Paul W.S. Anderson.But the comparison with the first episode ends there. In AVP Requiem, art direction, SFX, suspense, acting have been much improved compared to its prequel.I think the fierce critics have been frustrated because they expected any film with 'Alien' in its title to be a dark huis-clos with Sigourney Weaver in a spaceship. Unfortunately for them, Alien versus Predator is a different topic. The action takes place on Earth, in present time.If you can deal with this fact, you will find AVP Requiem a very enjoyable action movie, a coherent script, with characters you can connect with, and with some real moments of thrill.And if you are still worried about the depth of the scenario, I can assure you the script is better written than 'Inglorious Bastards' or some recent over-estimated movie.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
275,alexanderstephencraig,Well the first one was good anyways.,2,23 February 2017,"I love Predator, Predator 2, Predators, and am looking forward to The Predator. I love Alien and Aliens on a different level. Alien 3 and 4 are okay and I can't wait for Alien:Covenant. I thought A.V.P. was such a cool idea and it really panned out. I only watched the trailer for A.V.P. Requiem and decided not to watch it. Now ten years later, I've watched it. I wish I didn't. The writing for this film was absolute garbage. I loved how the last one left off with it's new and inventive opening for this film but I still guessed that wouldn't be enough to make it good on it's own. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and watched it anyways. The characters were written so poorly and stereotyped to their characters. Even the recently-out-of-jail character had a leather jacket. Come on. And why.. WHY did he say ""Get to the chopper"". Never write that again for any character ever. Unless Arnold comes back. The directing.. Was horrible. To be honest I couldn't see anything with the quick cuts and very very dark filter which completely ruined the movie. Underworld does it right, this does it very very wrong. Even the first film did it but it looked good. And if you like those flashing lights helping emulate impending danger from Alien, well it's not done correctly in this film either. Nothing really is. It doesn't pay any homage to the franchises. When it comes down to it, I'm going to assume the studios and producers behind the film decided to find cheap actors, directors, and writers to make a big buck. And with a small budget they probably had to keep scenes dark for lack of authenticity in the image. I could be completely wrong, but even if I am, this film is still bad. I hate more than anything, that they left this on an ending that slightly sets it up for another film. They couldn't have really thought it was going to be good enough. But hey, they did better than Freddy V.S. Jason right? My advice would be to watch A.V.P. and then watch the ""Silent Night"" trailer to this film and leave it at that. I wouldn't even recommend watching it if it's free to you.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
276,LawrenceOfAlabama,"This film ""Strause'D"" me out!",4,26 December 2007,"I didn't expect much from an AVP sequel. I still think Aliens (thats the 2nd film) will never be topped for action and overwhelming alien-frenzy. However I'm a fan: and that's just what ""The Brothers Strause"" are counting on. Guess after some FX work, a Nickleback Music Vid, and Herbie Fully Loaded they earned the nickname? Anyhow let's dive into AVP2. Here is my total take on the film. It's Critters (Aliens land in the woods and attack the folks) mixed with Gremlins (I should say Gremlens 2 ""The New Batch"" because of the same sequel formula) and a dash of Pedetor (the Governators old stick).Theren lies the problem: ITS TOO MUCH! There is so much going on and none of it is remotely fresh. It's as if all three of the films I just mentioned were put into a STRAUSE BROS Cuisinart and served up as an after-Christmas feast. However I'm still hungry for something. How about a serving of PLOT? Or some acting with the main course? Or how about turning on a light while I dine? Geeze even a candle would have helped. This film is so dark (the fights, the killings, the theater where I viewed it) I was so happy to hit the lobby afterwords.I've always thought that dimly lit bars make the women seem hotter.

277,pal-o-lo,Booooring,2,15 June 2008,"Okay, what can I say? I WAS RIGHT!!! They should never have made a sequel to AVP. This was just, just. words don't describe it, but I have to try. This movie sucked big time! The plot was minimal. The violence was chaotic, and meaningless. and the acting was horrible. They pulled out just about every clichè there is. even the busty blonde chick. Okay, she didn't flash her titties, but she did die very predictably.As in the first movie, the camera was a nightmare. Where in the first movie one didn't know what was up, down, left or right, in this movie there were such an overabundance of close up shots, that we never got to see the whole monster.The whole movie seemed rushed, as if its goal was to put the most violence into the shortest time frame-possible, without concern to the storyline. and hello, pregnant women and children? it should have added tons to the horror meter, but failed miserably to do so, because in the whole movie there wasn't one single moment of believable display of feelings. there was no personality to the victims, that could allow us to connect to their horror on an emotional level.Not even Reiko Aylesworth could save this movie, and it didn't look like she tried, or were allowed to try. Her role was much too two-dimensional and downplayed. She were supposed to be a solider, for crying out loud! And the worst part of that, is that i am sure she could have pulled off the soldier act really good, if the script had allowed it.All in all this is one of the crappiest movies I have seen in a very long time. It is with severe doubts I give this one a 2. And that is only because Reiko Aylesworth is maybe the most beautiful woman ever to have been born.Do yourselves a favor folks. Do not waste good money on this movie.

278,zillabob,A Letdown...(SOME SPOILERS),4,26 December 2007,"The positives include some stunning location photography(thank you Canada, more later on that however)in the start, and the suit work is great and eschews CG work, thankfully, save for a few shots perhaps.The negatives outweigh all that. There are no humans we ever like or care about as we never get to know them in the film's scant one hour 25 minute running time. There are complete rips(maybe ""homages"") to both previous Predator and Alien entries to the point they are re-creations of the same scenes. In the first film, there is a genuine heroine and a Predator that we not only like both, but they have a genuine chemistry! Nothing like that happens here. There is a lone Predator who's a ""fixer"" who is sent in to completely wipe out all evidence of the crash landed ship, bodies, and aliens. Yet, he does something that completely, illogically ruins his mission purpose-he kills someone and leaves them hanging from a tree to be found! The FX work of the Predator home world shine-what little we see of it. Maybe the film should have taken place there. That would have been fun to see.What bothered me was the out and out lack of scope to the film. These films have always worked best with monsters vs humans in an enclosed environment. That's what worked about the first AVP film and, I love that one for it's balance of humor and action. Even ""Predator humor"" worked there. This film is largely humorless-one joke is said and that's a throwaway line used in other films. With no insult or offense to Canada, it has all the hallmarks of a somewhat lower-budgeted Canadian film-where it was(again, stunning forests) mostly filmed, and most of the cast and production people, save at least for the FX/suit guys(from Hollywood) came from. Canadian Robert Joy, who's a regular to TV and movies there, even shows up as an ""important mysterious military guy"" but winds up not bearing much presence. No one really has much of a presence. It's also filmed in this murky-too-close-up way that just gets visually confusing.It's also *blatantly* sadistic-not in a fun way-in one part of the film. Perhaps the FX people or whoever always wanted to see a pregnant woman-on the verge of birth-infected with writhing aliens, and some other things happen, not so nice, to babies and children. Ick.This film is like looking at say SPECIES 2 or HIGHLANDER-THE FINAL DIMENSION as sequels, compared to what has come before. Had it been in the drive-in days it would have been a summer quickie. I'd heard that Fox, upon seeing it, had no idea really how to sell it which is why it wound up on Xmas day as a release, as it had been ready last summer and then was highly edited and some scenes re-shot.

Those of you who really just wanted to see a movie with aliens and predators wrecking crap and each other will have a blast.The movie is a checklist of clichés, gimmicks, and devices. But more than that, it's a checklist of all the superficial crap fans want to see. Ever wonder if an alien's retractable jaws can punch through a safety helmet? NOW YOU KNOW! There is no logic or sense, rhyme or reason to this movie. But it IS loaded to the gills with violence. It's ridiculously, over-the-top, gloriously violent. Every time you get sick of the plot or characters, something dies. Even if you count JUST kids in the movie, there are still five kills (counting kids in utero at least) alone.

Hollywood is finally trying to bring us some good movies to the screen, instead of bringing back old television shows, like they did in the past. i.e. Starsky & Hutch, Bewitched, Inspector Gadget, etc.This movie AVP R is not suppose to be a movie like ""Crash"" or ""The Ten Commandments"" or some other Academy Award Winner movie, it's about pretend monsters from outer space for crying out loud.It's called ""FICTION"" people. It's not based on a true story or happened sometime ago in the distant past.It was made for pure enjoyment period.So just go see this type of movie with a kind of teenage going to the drive in type of night, with popcorn and the one you love on your arm and enjoy yourself and stop being so ""critcal"" about the lighting and the plot and the script being this and that, blah, blah, blah. Just enjoy the (&^#%*(%& film.This movie was fantastic - it was dark, gory and bloody, just what you need at a movie.

To be honest, I kinda liked this movie. Finally a movie that doesn't try to be PG-13 at all cost. It's hard to say anything about the movie since it has almost no plot. It's kind of a teenager splatter movie. With a bit of sci-fi in the mix. What I really didn't like about the movie was, that it mostly took place during the night. Which resulted in the fact that you mostly don't know what's going on. There are a few very nice splatter scenes. They would have been even nicer if the screen wasn't dark though. I am not gonna talk a lot about the plot, since most of you do know it already.So my recommendation is the following: If you look for a gory movie that doesn't make you think too much AVP: Requiem might be the right movie for you.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
282,LordBlacklist,Slasher flick: a breakdown of AVP-R,4,30 December 2007,"With this movie I was really hoping that the idea was to make up for the hashed together ineptitude of the first AVP, and yet to my horror: Requiem is far worse than I could have imagined.My hopes were up in the opening moments of the film inside the Predator ship, and I almost breathed a sigh of relief when we finally saw the Predator home world (a throwaway digital matte painting, but still nice to finally see it) and then of course, the humans (if such poorly written characters can be referred to as such) are introduced...One must wonder why it seems to be impossible for Fox to make a good film out of Aliens and Predators. At the very least the supposed filmmakers could have done their homework.Characters are set up in the same manner in which we would expect from the worst Friday the 13th Sequel. The pizza delivery scene was cringe inducing as was every other scene of character interaction that followed it. Bimbos and teen non actors do not make for a REAL film, they make for a cheap flick, and Alien 1-3 and the Predator movies were good because they were produced above the concept (remember that the 1st Alien is a ""B"" movie done as an ""A"" movie) The Strause brothers really missed an opportunity, that could have been rectified by simply knowing their Alien+Predator roots: In both the Alien and Predator films we are introduced to characters that are part of a larger group (Alien: Refinery workers, Aliens: Marines, Alien 3: Convicts and in the Predator films we generally follow a main hero part of a unit; Predator, Arnold--Special forces, Predator 2: Danny Glover, Police) and it's easy to see where the filmmakers of both franchises started to go wrong: in Alien Ressurrection we have pirates...or something, AVP we have...explorers?...with guns?? and of course in AVP-R we have teen slasher clichés. What is there to identify with here? In concept the idea of a convict returning to a small town and a war vet returning seemed a set up for a First Blood type of action hero, but like many things it was never paid off.The Film-making is equally devoid of rhyme of reason. There is no sense of forward momentum to the action, just small sequences that build the most minuscule levels of tension or interest only to cut away just when they're getting interesting...taking the audience out of the movie at every turn. The action scenes themselves, though much ballyhooed in the trailers, are so darkly lit, it is literally impossible to tell what is going on during the fight scenes when they finally occur. Basically, the movie is hindered from many levels. Bad actors combined with poor direction and an atrocious screenplay (which as a screenwriter myself I noticed, seemed to hit every wrong note and cliché that only the most untalented writer devoid of ideas could have hashed together) The WRITING, if it can be called that, is not even direct to video quality, nor does it demonstrate a shred of respect for the established lore of the previous entries in the series. Why does the Predalien all the sudden have the ability to shoot alien embryos down a pregnant woman's throat to use her as an incubator for chestbursters? More than likely because the brain dead screenwriter needed a way to have more aliens for the predator to fight (and given the accelerated growth time even more so than the first AVP: as quickly as possible. Why must meaningless small talk between cardboard cutouts on sticks (meaning the supposed characters)substitute for real character development? (Remember a character is defined by what they DO, not SAY). Why is the Sheriff leading civilians to a cache of guns? (isn't he an officer of the law?) How does the bimbo of all people know where they are? Why does the Predalien wait for the Predator to VERY SLOWLY remove his mask before it attacks? Why are the aliens still falling into that nasty series-post-Alien 3 habit of hissing all the time to let their prey know to run? How on Earth did this series devolve to a character saying ""People are dying...we need guns!"" (how this writer even works is beyond me, and reflects badly on Fox's already destroyed artistic reputation. It's like everyone involved in the making of this film suffered from a mental impairment or really are that inept at every level of the film-making process. The EFFECTS are pretty lousy this time around. The Aliens look like men in suits and ADI is just getting lazy with their creature design. The Aliens look like modified leftovers from Alien Resurrection, with that same bulky musculature around the arms as if they did not learn from that movie that it was not a good design, nor a good one to recycle. Again, everything is shrouded in such a state of darkness not to create mystery or atmosphere, but simply to hide how bad the creatures look. And just like in AVP, Stan Winston is sorely missed when the fake looking Predator face is revealed.There are too many faults to list so I will just say this: Do not waste your money on this movie. Fox is beyond caring about the fans, as this cheap and trashy film is clearly evidence of. I felt bad having taken my girlfriend to see it (though it was free) and apologized to her profusely after. This is one die-hard fan who is done with the franchise.Note to Fox: What we really wanted wasn't a mindless slasher flick, it was a film adaptation of the original Darkhorse Comicbook, which was better than anything you've produced for this franchise post 1993.Signing off.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
283,hypostylin,Because Friday the 13th is already being remade.,1,31 December 2007,"Predators are the Jason Voorhees of outer space -- well, in the first AVP, they were more like a bunch of intergalactic Bernie Goetzes, but I digress. They don't talk (those little clicky- clicky noises may count in their language, but do diddly squat for an Anglo such as myself), they conceal their ghastly faces behind masks, and they have a tendency to slaughter, disintegrate, pulverize, eviscerate and otherwise do away with folks using a variety of hardware. Sadly, AVP-R -- whose actual title is so cumbersome even the film's promotional team had to abbreviate it -- bears a stronger resemblance to Jason X than it does to the fantastic first Predator movie and first two Alien movies. It's a hokey geek show that is so geared towards the fanboy population that I felt as though I should have applied an extra layer of Mitchum that day. The earlier Alien and Predator films were all about characters -- terrestrial characters, that is. Think of the Herculean montage of Arnold preparing for his climactic battle with the creature in Predator. Think of the dynamics between the marines and the surrogate mother-daughter relationship between Ripley and Newt in Aliens. Those earlier films were about how and if these strong, beautiful, and finely drawn characters could escape calamity. The creatures in those films were props -- albeit some of the scariest and most masterfully created props in cinematic history, but props nonetheless. In AVP-R, the humans are the props. They have to be: the script centers around them being turned into mincemeat. Nothing is sacred here -- even a 10-year-old kid gets the chest- burster treatment and a baby is miscarried in a manner too repugnant to divulge. Every single line of dialogue is superfluous, and the film just throws meaningless and inconsequential scenes of tepid human interaction at us because ... well, I dunno ... because convention demands some semblance of character development, even when the whole point of the movie is to watch latex monsters fight to the finish -- hey, even Godzilla vs. Mothra had its moments of exposition.The biggest mistake of these AVP movies is that they let the creatures supplant the humans. Because they neither talk nor emote, the creatures are simply not interesting characters. At least Jason has somewhat of a mythology; these over-fetishized beasties don't give us anything to work with.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

I got to laugh at it a bit, since they pretty much did go for a ""let's do stuff that's so much nastier than has been done before even if it's silly"" vibe. I'll not include an spoilers here, so no examples.The one thing that bothers me most is that Fox has the Alien and Predator franchises and they combine them for box office gold, and yet they limit the budget horribly. Watching the movie, you can tell that they spent 1/3 what they'd spend on an average action movie. Perhaps less. That's not fair to the audience.Anyway, only see it if your attitude meets the following criteria:1) You don't care if this movie is inconsistent with the previous movies. 2) You don't care if this movie is inconsistent within itself. 3) You don't care that you never really get a good look at an alien, a predator, or a predalien. 4) You don't care.Just make sure you don't care when you see this movie. I saw it with two friends, leaving the wives at home. After, we discussed everything that was silly and wrong with this movie, and finally I said, """"Okay. Let me throw this at you. What could they have done worse? Can you think of one way to change this movie and actually make it worse?"" None of us could come up with one.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
285,SteveStockholm,"Not Alien, not Predator, not even Alien vs Predator",1,10 May 2010,"First let me say that I actually liked the first Alien versus Predator. It was a bit of a b-movie but not at all bad. Therefore I had some hopes for AVP Requiem but I was sadly disappointed.The classic scifi-horror formula that was established by Alien (where the viewer get to know a small group of characters well before they get in trouble with said aliens) was also followed by the first AVP movie. Sadly AVP Requiem throws this out the window and replaces it with a classic splatter-movie formula. In other words, the human characters have no importance, depth or relevance whatsoever. They are simple stereotypes who's only purpose is to be victims for the monsters.Unfortunately, the Aliens and Predators don't have any depth either. They don't even have much to do with the originals, apart from appearance. Both species are simply ""monsters"" who happily slaughter the ridiculous clichés that passes for human characters.The script is absolutely horrible, even for a b-movie. The suspense, creepy atmosphere and action of the original franchises has been completely replaced with cheap surprise-effects and lots of gore with ripped off bodyparts and splatter. The story carries all the complexity of a porn-movie and can be summarized as ""spaceship crashes in a remote area, locals get massacred by Aliens and Predators. The End"".Life is too short to waste on a train-wreck of a movie like this one. It's simply horrible and yes, that is true even if you loved the first AVP.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
286,McQueen1980,A Requiem for Johnny Lewis,5,6 February 2019,"The movie itself plays out as a typical alien/ predator movie which is probably the biggest and most successful franchise for 20th century fox. However it is poorly lit by the DP so sometimes it's hard to follow those alien predator predalien fights that we paid to see. Anyway in the directors commentary the brothers strause talk about killing off Ricky / johnny Lewis in the movie which now seems creepy even though they changed their mind I think and he was kept on to the end. In 2011 Johnny Lewis got a severe cranial injury after a road accident and subsequently went off the rails and died the following year while attacking and robbing an old woman.

287,Installation_At_Orsk,Nothing but darkness and dullness,1,1 August 2009,"There's never been a darker movie than this. And I don't mean 'dark' in the 'downbeat and disturbing' way, but in the literal, 'I can't see a damn thing' sense. Even the scenes set in the middle of the day are hard to make out, the film seemingly underexposed and the contrast ramped up so high that the slightest shadow becomes a solid swathe of black. Once night falls, the movie might as well be a radio play - all you can make out are occasional glimpses of slime glistening in the all-swallowing darkness.However, I wasn't missing anything by being rendered night-blind, as the script is utterly bland and banal. There are no interesting or sympathetic characters, no memorable dialogue, no thrilling set-pieces, no cleverness or imagination involved at all. People bumble about, an Alien/Predator/Predalien bursts out of nowhere and kills them, repeat. Even the gore, which was supposed to set this film apart from the neutered PG-13 original AVP, fails to startle because it's lost in a sea of darkness and quick cuts. (The 'uncut' version was given a 15 certificate in the UK - exactly the same as its predecessor.)In fact, AVP2 is so bad it makes the first AVP look like a worthy successor to the works of Ridley Scott and James Cameron.

Nope-It was all still there: every cliché lifted from both franchises; a tough chick who can drive any tank, payloader, or helicopter laying around; a little girl that screams every time she sees a ""monster""; soldiers who are instantly wiped-out because that can't see an alien in front of their face; nuclear power plants and hospital roofs that look like terraforming factories; lots of flashing lights; incoherent plots; and, of course, lots of goo and gore just for the hell of it. I got my $2.50 worth of movie I guess.I recently saw the new ""Predators"" movie and it seemed a few notches above this one, so there may be some hope left for these movies--but I seriously doubt it...once a movie franchise becomes a video game it loses all credibility and generally no one puts any effort into improving it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
289,Acolin_f,Dull gray on gray in the rain,1,6 January 2008,"I've seen horribly bad shows in the movie theater before, but usually they are entertaining enough on the big screen to make it worth sitting through, if only to see the scenery, special effects or the action sequences. This movie hardly qualifies on that account.Aliens versus Predators - Requiem is the sequel to the silly, but entertaining, battle between the antagonists of two other movies; Sigourney Weaver's ugly space bugs in the Alien series and the human hunters from outer space in Arnold Schwarzenegger' Predator movie. In both movies, the visitors conjoin on our planet to kill each other and us. I did sit through the sequel, but only because my bored date wasn't ready to move.I tired quickly of the gray-black figures fighting in stupid close-ups in dark-gray computer generated rain. There are no heroes, story, dialogue, wonderful scenes or redeeming features to this movie. It is a big snore.An alien predator is one of the protagonists. He doesn't speak English, he only clicks (purrs) and there are no sub-titles. While the human hero in the leather jacket inexplicably has nothing but good luck, the heavily armored predator battling Weaver's bugs is slowly losing the battle. For reasons never explained in the movie, he rushes to earth to do battle with a geometrically ever-increasing number of alien bugs. It soon becomes obvious that his heroic struggle is fruitless. He is inevitably losing. Pity.The predator has the one part that might have added a little drama to the saga. Of course, acting out emotions might have been hard for a butt-ugly alien predator clad from head to toe in dark-gray armor. Not that would have mattered. There is virtually no acting in this movie, with or without armor. Loved ones die left and right and no one character shows much anguish or remorse. Not the actors' fault really. The emphasis in this move is so much on making a lot of action out nothing that nobody paid attention to the dialogue. Take the gray on gray in the rain action sequences out of the script and nobody will know what the conflicts in this thoroughly forgettable movie are about.Like this movie? Then check out Ang Lee's equally dull The Hulk. What a waste of money. I would be embarrassed leaving a screening for such uninspired dreck. What possible platitude I could I offer my host? How do projects like this ever get out of the can? I am glad I stayed though. The final scene is a blatant and idiotic grab for yet another Aliens versus Predator movie with our government secreting the predator's futuristic silver gun for upcoming battles. Yawn. Who cares? This is the season that Oscar quality movies compete for the gold statue. There are many great action movies to see. Check out any Jet Li movie, Eastern Promises, History of Violence, 3:10 to Yuma or Casino Royale. They are both excellent.

Secondly, because no one went to the last one in the theaters they really weren't willing to stick their necks out financially. Besides this, AVPR is an excellent jaunt thru the AVP lore. The complete lack of any sort of story is nothing in comparison to the awesome action that takes place on the screen. Folks, this is an action movie. Aliens was Horror/Sci-Fi. Not every adventure into this series has to be as serious as that title. Anyway, it's an excellent movie, take it for the good time that it is.

291,marc242,B-Movie Teenager Trash,1,31 December 2007,"This movie is terrible, simply put. Take Dawsons Creek (TV-Series) a number of random teenager-filled horror movies (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Scream etc.) and combine them with the two most iconic contemporary movie monsters. What you get is a deformed abomination with no interesting story, annoying characters (pizza boy ? hello ?) and some poorly choreographed action scenes. This shows that the Brothers Strause should stay out of movies and continue their FX work. They are simply no directors. Even comparing this mess with the original movies is heresy.The Strause Brotthers try desperately to cater to the geeks with numerous references to the original movies and truly senseless gore which seriously damages the movie. Instead of bringing something original to the franchise like most directors before did,they (and Shane Salerno,Script) just rehash certain ""classic moments"" and present to us the poorly designed Predalien. And no, its not well made. It looks as if they took an already existing Alien Suit and retrofitted it with additional mandibles, some Dreadlocks and a slightly different predator-like color scheme. (I know, its actually more complicated than that, but thats what it looks like).Why do all AVP-Directors (The Brothers and Paul W.S. Anderson) pretend to be die-hard Alien & Predator Fans,if they obviously do not understand what the original movies were about? Its should not simply a wrestling-match where two idiots on steroids slug it out. Instead it should be a thrilling tale about survival,about our inner fears, about (realistically depicted) humans in extreme situations we care about, and corporate greed (the underlying Weyland-Yutani story arc).Sorry,but the two AVP movies so far are serious disappointments, and its a shame that most fans will still flock to the cinemas,which will lead to a predictably terrible AVP3.

292,stormlord-2,A Pity,2,4 January 2008,"There was a time when Alien films were taken seriously. Back in the late 70s and mid 80s Alien and Aliens made movie history as two of the best sci-films made to date. Alien as a classic scary house horror and Aliens a fast paced combat action thriller. Sadly the Aliens of today are mere cannon fodder in the latest summer popcorn flick thrown out by FOX still trying to cash in on a once classic series.The film looks fine. Both the Aliens and Predators are well done and certainly look the part, there is only one small problem. ...there is no story....none. The Humans come and go and die so fast that you can't keep track, and so many are killed off that you can't possibly feel anything for them. The whole film feels like a bunch of separate scenes about a bunch of people who don't even know each other all tacked together and made into a film.To FOX. Do yourselves and the rest of us a favor. Hire a couple of writers then actually produce a ""story"", something for your wizz bang special effects to actually be built around. Don't be so wasteful of two great creations that you have made. The Aliens series is long dead despite the fact that the film has been screaming out for a decent follow up to Aliens (made back in 1986).

Now i can only assume that it was a queen because it was impregnating people, and it was doing it straight from mouth to mouth rather than laying eggs for the little spider things.The creatures also burst through people far too quickly in comparison to the older films and also there were two major spaceship crashes and a big explosion from the bomb early on in the film and no one in the town saw or heard anything, now to me that seemed a bit stupid.Ending, was obviously setting up for some kind of a sequel but in my opinion was stupid, slow and boring.

It didn't start out too badly - good suspense (despite plot holes). But too quickly, as the predaliens reproduced and spread, with only one predator to save the day, it seemed impossible. And the predator was nothing like the 1st one who went up against Arnold. This one was a bad shot, lost his weapons - fumbled around. Now dark worked in the Alien series, but not all the scenes need to be dark (light-wise). I wanted to see some detail when the alien and predator fought. I could barely figure out which was which in the fight scenes. I didn't know the queen was putting multiple eggs into the humans via the face until late in the movie because it was so dark. It also would have been nice if a few more people fought and stuck around more than a minute or so - even given the bad acting. It would have made it a more interesting fight. Too predictable. Everyone you thought would die, did, in the way you thought. I enjoyed the first AVP - more than most of the reviewers - because at least there was suspense, a plot that was OK and it followed what we'd learned about the aliens and predators from previous movies. I am not a real critic on movies - I go to be entertained and suspend any semblance of reality. This one was awful - don't waste your rental money at this point. Very disappointing.

Actually there is just about one surprise death throughout, and even that becomes obvious since the >>> victim <<< goes tellingly hysterical a few sharp cuts back....... never a useful thing in horror movies.Too bad that all the semi-cool moments were stolen straight from previous installments (swimming Alien, dripping saliva from above etc.), anyway, and even these were solidly wasted in lame, uninspired scenes or not followed up at all..Oh, and the script non-chalantly throws out established ""alien-lore"" out of the window, say, by massively re-defining the alien gestation cycle and time-frame, Predator weaponry, hybrid-alien off-spring. Most of the Aliens also seem to have taken evening-classes in speed-redecoration of human habitats.... rebuild hospital interiors in less than 15 minutes ? Not a problem...... sheesh !Well, to be... fair....there are some nicely creepy moments, yes (the hybrid stalking through the local hospital is.... macabre), but these are totally wasted, as whatever minuscule atmosphere is being built up in these, evaporates instantly through too-fast cuts, wooden acting (to be polite) and plot-holes you could comfortably drive through with an assault-tank. A few, rare laughs (like the stoned clerks....)... some ham-fisted ""poetic justice"".... and's that all there is.

The storyline sucks massively, it's boring and seems to drag on forever. They slam so many characters at you that you don't care if they live or die. You don't develop an attachment to anyone and their dialogue is very bland. It's not because of bad acting, it's simply because of bad writing.

It's not that I'm offended or can't take disturbing gore and deaths in a horror movie but these things just had not meaning. It was like ""hey look how disturbing we can make this!""

This was really a stand alone story they decided to make a sequel to a movie it had nothing to do with.The town is eventually over run by Aliens because the Predalien is some weird queen crossbreed that can hentai tentacle rape pregnant women and make their stomachs then explode with 6-8 chestbursters.

It's such a killer concept, but if you've got an 8 foot laser-assisted predator duking it out with a gang of slavering xenomorphs and it's boring as hell, then something's gone awry. The acting is uniformly terrible, not helped by the clunky script(there's some fantastically bad lines here) and it's baffling that such an event movie has been farmed out to a pair of unproven directors who on this evidence can't make a coherent movie.They at least seem to know the franchises, and show this by endlessly riffing on memorable moments from other Alien/Predator movies, but all that succeeds in doing is highlighting just how vastly superior those movies were. And yes, that includes the first AvP. There's even a maternity ward sequence obviously inspired by the Judge Dredd Vs Aliens comics, which again is a potent reminder that this crossover thing can actually work when crafted by people who know what they're doing. These Strause fellows obviously don't, and there's no excuse for this utter tripe.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
304,onelegobuilder,"Good entertainment to pass the time, but the direction is routine and clumsy.",6,28 December 2007,"*TONS OF SPOILERS* This is the fourth predator film and the sixth Alien film. In my opinion the Strause Brothers wisely released it as Rated-R because it gives the film the look of earlier graphic novels of the two franchises. There's people blood, Predator blood and Alien/acid blood spilling all over the place. I liked the action sequences, the predator's new toys, and the pred-alien which was very impressive even though you may not get a good look at it. But the most fatal flaw the directors did was get carried away with their monsters on-screen. The predator can be seen on-screen more than any other character in the whole movie, making it look like it's his movie and not the humans'. The humans by the way were hollow, bland, and with no real character development. But that's okay because everyone knows the monsters will come to claim them in a matter of minutes. Just like predator 2 but it was a good movie still. Plus you can hear that beat sound reused again from earlier predator films.In a small town in Colorado The predator's ship crashes in the woods and the aliens escape and spread throughout the town. The last predator goes to earth to seek vengeance upon the aliens. Armed with lots of weapons, the predator kills everyone and everything he sees. But wait, before the predator leaves on his mission we get a glimpse of his face. Plus his multiple fangs barely move at all while he screams an unfamiliar screech. What made the first predator film so compelling is that the filmmakers tantalize the audience with how much of the predator they reveal. First you see through the eyes of the predator in the infrared vision. Second you see his silhouette only while invisibility is turned on. Third is with invisibility off and you see his full physical form. And finally you see the mask come off and realize he is ""one ugly mother f**ker."" But at the end of this movie where he pulls off the mask to face his final opponent, no surprises there.Strause brothers deliver tons of violence and terrifying moments. Something Paul Anderson failed to do. But it's as if they were competing against Stephen Hopkins, James Cameron, and Paul Anderson as to who could make the goriest sci-fi film. Most of the killings and chests explosions get tiresome after a while. The acting from a cast of unknowns is decent and I could sympathize for them since they're just playing regular people and not idiotic foreigners and geologists, those characters were all push-overs to the alien and the predator in the previous film.All in all, it wasn't as bad as AVP1, but don't get your hopes up. The ending to this film isn't a big surprise like the last film. In fact as soon as the credits roll you'll say ""okay what just happened?""",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Rampant horny teens have never been a part of the vocabulary of this series but here we're not just introduced to them but it's complete with all the standard stereotypes: heart broken misunderstood geeky ex boyfriend still obsessed with his girl (check), blonde bimbo who strips down to her panties just to supply some tits and ass (check), asshole jock new boyfriend to beat up the ex-boyfriend and leave previously mentioned blonde with emotional dilemma (check). Where is the cabin in the woods? This nose dive in originality would be bad enough for a slasher horror franchise but to introduce it to the Alien series is too far off course in every way possible. Now thanks to the history of slasher flicks you know exactly who is going to die and when. There are other truly silly moments. When the Predator ship crash lands on Earth because of the alien infestation one single predator gets the distress call and travels to earth to take care of the situation. It reminds me of the old 'one Texas ranger, one riot' joke. Who is this lone troubleshooter, the sheriff of Predator city or just some unemployed bum with nothing else to do?And despite it all happening in a small town near the mountains there are teams of homeless people living in the sewers. Really? This is not NYC. It seems that the screenwriter is just pulling random ready made characters and situations off the done- to-death shelf without checking the labels first.And as for the the tacked on afterthought ending with the men in black and the secret government... you know what, who cares.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
306,husks,Boring is a good word for it.,5,1 February 2008,"Overall, this movie wasn't terrible. It was just boring.Sure, there was some fun action - the usual type from alien action movies. But, there was one predator and it didn't even make nice with humans. I keep waiting for these predator things (""yautjas"") to somehow use humans to help do their hunting bit. OK, there was one thing in this movie: the predator uses one human as bait to catch an alien.The only remotely interesting scenes - as usually happens with me in science fiction films - are the last minute feeling back-stories. We see the predator home planet (or maybe a colony?) ever so briefly when the predator - we'll call him Jerry - figures out there's some aliens to hunt.But then I'm thinking - ever searching for the back-story - ""is Jerry going to hunt the aliens, or clean-up the crashed space-ship? Is Jerry someone important, or is he like, 'oh, here's a fun way for me to get some glory hunting the Alien-thing."" And then, it's sort of like, ""why is Jerry the only one there? Why didn't Jerry's friends come?""And then there's this guy called ""Colonel Stevens"" who flies around in a AWAC and at the end delivers the Jerry's left-behind gun to some skinny Asian lady in a washed out city-scape. What the hell was that two minutes at the end?With a little research, you can figure out that the Asian lady is Yutani of ""Weyland-Yutani"", the corporation in the Alien backstory. So, you know, it's like, ""hey, that's how they started things"" or something.Maybe we can get an Umbrella Corp. tie-in. That'd be great.Let's recap some good stuff in the film though. These are mostly ""novel"" things:* We see a kid get attached by an alien face-hugger thing. Yay! Films seems to shy away from showing us kids eating it. On the other, they only imply that a room full of new borns get killed by aliens. Who wants to show a blood soaked nursery. Not ""The Brothers Strause"" apparently.* A room of pregnant ladies getting infected with aliens worms.* At least we get to see the predator home (?) planet. That part was kind of cool.* Dual, stoner head explosion at the hands of Jerry. Nice work.* Seeing the predator city and inside of predator ships. Nifty!Yup. It's not really bad like you're expecting. It's just not too interesting. Like a burger with just buns.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
307,svetlastoyanova,Requiem That,7,20 February 2008,"The Sci-fi horror has never been so familiar. You know all the Alien sequels; you know all the predator sequels; you have seen them together in the 2004 Alien vs. Predator, which is the best lethal collaboration after Ronny Yu's Freddy vs. Jason, which was actually the inspiration for another human massacre of three kinds. As good as that franchise was the Requiem comes with a pinch of disappointment. The story picks up from where the first movie finished with the new alien breed bursting out of the dead Predator's chest, and if that is not enough to make you want to see the Aliens vs. Predator-Requiem, then the fact that he actually is set free on earth will.This time around it is merciless than ever, the directors the brothers Strause haven't spared us anything. There are three colours of blood spilling throughout the whole movie and loads of it. No one is speared, regardless of age and gender and the new creature the Predalien has a surprising new look, abilities and lethal moves to show. All the action sequences are what they should be-bloody and spectacular and not too CGI heavy. The only tiny flaw that movie have that makes all the difference is the cast. It is a double sided blade working with unknown actors. The first time around they got it right, but the Requiem does not deliver here. You see a lot of new faces acting, you can actually see them act and overact. Very poor performance and ever poorer efforts to convince the audience in something they are not convinced themselves. The monsters do not disappoint at all though and the next thing you see is another bad actor sliced in half or melting in acid.Svetla Stoyanova",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
308,Paul-Corio,Franchise Killer,1,20 January 2008,"**MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**After watching the first AvP, I remember being pretty disappointed. Why? Consider the pedigree of the Alien and Predator films and you will have a list as long as your arm containing some of the most respected and fabulous contributors to the world of film....Scott, Weaver, Glover, Schwarzenegger, Fincher, Holme, Dance...need I go on? AvP lacked substance and in my humble opinion was directed by a man who since Event Horizon has not been involved in anything half decent related to film and seriously needs to get to grips and understand his subject matter more.The same is true of AvP: Requiem which quiet frankly adds nothing new or original to the genre except blood, shocks and gore. The acting is woefully poor, the plot and the story are cumbersome and features some monumental and gaping plot holes, the direction is almost non existent, rubbish, bilge, disappointing, etc, etc, I am not a die hard fan of the whole Alien vs Predator universe, however I have seen all of the films featuring these two extra terrestrials and even I know the rules, the do's and don't's, what they can do, what they can't do and that is where my underlying problem with both the AvP movies lies. The directors have not been true to the genre and stayed within the boundaries of the genre. If you are going to try something new don't just disregard the heritage of the genre and just make stuff up to suit your needs, respect it, handle it with care, love it, concentrate on telling a good story first and let the Aliens and Predators look after themselves - sadly Colin and Greg Strause did none of this.In order to bring some credibility back to the AvP genre, something massive needs to happen in the future to avoid the unmemorable B movie black hole that is AvP: Requiem, hopefully the studios will put some care into any 3rd instalment and not treat the whole genre like a cash cow for some fast bucks.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Just predator and alien killing killing killing... not even in interesting ways. The screen is often so black that you wonder why they even bothered to shoot it. I see white dots moving around, could be just about anything. What is up with this movie?? I liked all the other alien movies... predator 1 and 2... just this one and AVP1 sucked ass. Must be by a crappy writer or director. I'm going to make note of who it is so I never have to watch another one of his or her dull movies ever again. And I'll be straight up with you... any movie that has action in it and is remotely watchable, I will watch, and I won't complain... I'll give it 5/10 and I'll say ""It's just another movie, I'd watch it again if it were on TV."" This movie is TERRIBLE! And why do they have to have a battle on earth?? In the AVP world there are many other planets. So after AVP1, the same ship that left planet earth somehow does a U-turn and ends up crash landing back on earth.

311,PyTom83,Enjoyable film,7,11 June 2009,"Ridiculous film title aside, it's easily an enjoyable Alien/Predator film; the acting is actually decent unlike it's predecessor and in AVP:R, you actuality have a predator actually being badass hunter like they should be, you have xenomorphs actually acting like xenomorphs and being lethal and we even get a PREDALIEN hybrid! Do you know how badass that stuff is? Just take a moment to think about that PREDATOR ALIEN HYBRID. I also liked how it created sci-fi locations out of mundane environments and the music was a little more faithful than the original, unlike it's predecessor.Though, despite the good things it has going for it, it's not a great film as it's poorly shot and a bit too dark in a lot of scenes; I just wish I didn't have to squint to follow what was happening on screen all the time. And also, at times, it does feel like a teen slasher film. It also had completely unlikeable characters that served as nothing more than gore fodder to up the death. In original movies, you cared when people died.Anyways, I enjoyed it a lot more than its predecessor, but that's like saying that having cancer is better than being dead, but at least AVPR wasn't a lame ass PG-13 cash grab; it was just a R-rated cash grab.

Should have got a screenwriter, script editor, director in when making the film. Tried to make it style over substance, but lacked the style. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of both series and actually enjoyed the original AVP.This however went out of it's way to try and shock (as other reviews will confirm), but failed to do so because it was trying to get attention too hard, (like a 5 year old).If there is another, please move away from the simplistic teen slasher, 'Gosh, look at me, aren't I terrible' approach and have something a little more thought out.There was 1 plus point - we did get a brief look at the Predators' homeworld and a nod to the original 'Alien' film.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
313,Vergilya,Killing machines on the loose!,6,6 January 2008,"The Alien (Xenomorph) and Predator (Yautja) designs are the most iconic creatures in the movie and toy universe. Both these personifications of annihilation have created fans who adore and worship the fantastical and unparalleled fabrication of fear.The franchise for both the characters have been resurrected time and again and it is inevitable that the two shall meet. The first encounter between them was from a comic created by Chris Warner under the Dark Horse comics publication.With both these superstars of action, suspense and horror what can Alien Versus Predator offer in the second time around? Lots more action, suspense and horror for sure.Although no one can replace Sigourney Weaver and Arnold Schwarzenegger in their roles as Ripley and Dutch, the creatures themselves are good enough to watch.In AVP2 the plot is loosely extracted from previous Alien and Predator movies. There are recognizable scenes in which they are lifted off and amalgamated together for the sequel. The only direction different from the rest is the unpredictable lifespan of each of the human characters. Anyone is as easily eliminated as they are unknowns.At times the movie falls back into an era of B-grade movies with its cheesy dialogs and slash-kill sequences. It also breaks the rule of the killing spree towards every man, woman and child. No one is spared. The Predalien (a by product of the two species) can do some pretty nifty things the previous movies didn't delve into.For its effects and mindless appeal, AVP2 is as good to watch as any action, suspense or horror movie but don't count on any exceptional acting from the human offerings.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

316,Lord_Frog,Are you afraid of the dark?,1,23 May 2008,"The only way to enjoy this movie is to be scared of the dark, since about 80% of the movie is about watching a dark screen and trying to figure out what the hell is happening. Not that you will care too much after a few minutes, as what you get to see when the directors suddenly remember to switch on the lights on the set is neither exciting nor remotely interesting.It starts well enough for 5 minutes **SPOILER** when a little boy and his dad are both ""impregnated"" with aliens and give ""birth"". It's not so often that kids are killed in this kind of movie. **SPOILER** So I thought it may have a nasty edge... but nope it's almost Alone In The Dark from then on, in terms of what's on screen and also it's as bad as the Uwe Boll shittypiece. Maybe worse, as it's really almost impossible to see a thing.The trailer for this was very good, so kudos to Fox's marketing department... it seemed to blow AvP 1 out of the water.

317,salahlah23,Relied on brutality alone,3,23 November 2020,"It just managed to capture how brutal alien and predator encounters would be. That's it. Nothing else, no story, no acting, nothing.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
318,lysergic-acid,Reality check,8,18 May 2010,"So the general consensus seems to be that this was a terrible movie. Apparently, the aliens portrayed in the movie aren't aliens; the predator portrayed in the movie isn't predator-like; the acting is terrible; there is no plot; the special effects are lame; and the creators made this into a teen movie. But I wonder how much of this public backlash is due to genuine flaws in the movie, and how much is simply people clinging on to the words of a few professional critics, or simply going along with popular opinion.Cultural snobbery aside, AVPR isn't nearly as bad as many claim. Sure, it has a very straightforward plot (predators aren't known for their complex motives or multifaceted personalities), and neither the writing nor acting are going to win any Oscars any time soon, but as a sci-fi action/thriller, it delivers all that it advertises.I'm not sure what kind of portrayal of the alien xenomorphs people were expecting; they're pretty one-dimensional murder machines in all of the franchise movies. The only criteria for creating a believable xenomorph are good visual effects/costume design and well-choreographed body movements/mannerisms, and AVPR delivers in both categories. The star predator in the film is also well designed and competently portrayed. Both the xenomorphs and the predator follow closely the precedents set by previous movies. The only real aesthetic liberties the filmmakers took were in the design of the ""Predalien"", which actually turned out quite well (as expected, a blend of xenomorph and predator features and mannerisms). This contrasts sharply with the abomination of the alien ""newborn"" in Alien Resurrection.The film did however throw a curveball with the throat-impregnation of human females. Departing from canon was a real gamble on the part of the directors, but I can understand their decision, as it serves to make up for the lack of an alien queen in this installment and creates a threat of global infestation rather than simply having 4-5 aliens running amok in a small town of little consequence. Additionally, the imagery of a litter of newborn aliens writhing in the exploded stomach of a still-live host is even more horrific than the original chestburster concept (the hospital scene is all the more gruesome when you consider the likeliness that those alien babies had consumed the unborn child they replaced).No, AVPR did not take itself super seriously, and the producers didn't set out to create a new candidate for the Criterion Collection. But it's certainly not a teen movie by any stretch. Yes, one of the protagonists is the main hero's teenage brother. And, yes, there are 2-3 scenes portraying the life of this unpopular high school student in a small American town. But that's just part of necessary character development. Beyond that, the other 3-4 on-screen teenagers are just there for the same reasons as the gangsters in Predator 2 or the redshirts in Star Trek.Lastly, for all the criticism AVPR takes for being a ""B-movie"" with poor acting and an uninspired script, it is actually a much less cheesy/poorly acted/poorly written movie than Predator 2. If one can take off their rose-tinted glasses long enough to actually compare the two films, it becomes quite clear that AVPR is far from the worst film in the Alien/Predator series. Perhaps a movie starring an LAPD police detective is more exciting than one which follows ordinary residents of a small town, but AVPR makes it work, and without cheesy props, low quality sets, and godawful overacting stock characters.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
319,Charles_Carmichael,"So much promise, so little delivery",5,19 January 2008,"The first AVP was a decent foothold for a franchise to start with AVP films, however Requim fails to build or enhance on the first.There are multiple scenes during the film that feel stunted and heavily edited, the result is a rush to introduce a multitude of characters and backgrounds, which leaves the viewing public with little to understand their relationships. The quality of some of the characters is a static.The action scenes do not disappoint, which is possible the films saving grace, however the is far too little to be excited about.If you really want to see this on the 'big screen' then do not expect an Oscar winning story, if you are undecided, wait for DVD.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
320,BlackTaterTotallyBlue,"I thought this would suck big time, but actually...",6,1 September 2008,"...it wasn't anywhere near as bad as I'd expected.The problem is that it follows one of the most revered horror/sci-fi franchises in movie history. Judged in that context, sitting alongside Scott, Cameron and Fincher's entries (perhaps I shouldn't exclude John McTiernan's original Predator movie too, although it's not quite on a par) it will seriously disappoint. However when I consider Paul W.S. Anderson's 'AVP' travesty, which was so slight it was hardly an adaptation of a video game and more a re-enactment of several levels, this sequel appears to me a considerable improvement. An improvement no doubt due to the absence of Paul W.S. Anderson, who is only working due to the popularity of the games/franchises he frequently ruins.Granted, with clunkers like ""but the government never lies"" the dialogue is not this film's strength, and nor are the performances which range from so-so to pretty awful. What the film does achieve is putting the audience in the centre of the chaos. Like many of the best zombie movies, if you allow yourself, you inevitably begin to imagine yourself in that bleak situation. The directors keep an intensity and pace that is consistent throughout. Somehow, despite the film's many flaws it is an engaging ride. And thankfully, in contrast to it's PG-13 rated prequel, this R- rated entry doesn't pull any punches on the gore front...Giger's Alien design still retains it's power today and it is a chilling concept of putting Aliens on a recognisable contemporary earth. Indeed, these are the film's most successful moments: the alien at the child's bedroom window; the alien in the high school pool; the alien in the maternity ward and amongst the new born babies. In the late eighties Dark Horse released a series of comics which were to continue the story of 'Aliens'. These were great black and white Gothic nightmares featuring an Alien outbreak on earth. If only the film could have measured up to the promise of these books we would all have had a real treat. As it is, it only hints at what might have been, but with a concept so chilling this is still worth a look. Essentially if you are expecting a worthy successor to either franchise, you will surely be let down. However, if you watch it for the teen schlock horror, monster mash B-movie rental it is, you'll likely have an hour and a half of creepy fun. It's not good, but it's not awful either. And some credit must go to 'The Brothers Strause', for they partially succeeded where Paul W.S. Anderson failed utterly. I can't help imagine what might have been in more capable hands. Hey ho. Now grab some beers and go to your nearest rental store (it's not worth buying!) and treat yourself to a guilty pleasure. Just don't tell Ridley.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

This film started a bizarre chain of events, Being unable to see any of the action due to a very dark screen, I attempted to increase the brightness of my T.V with no success. Having concluded the HD T.V had died a death, I proceeded to pull all cables from the T.V and through it out the back door. I still desperately wanted to see the film on a large screen as I did not won't to miss any of the excellent special effect this film had to offer. It was late no shops were open, I drove round in a daze searching for a T.V. I passed a mates house and by chance his light was still on, I slammed the brakes on, and ran to his door, but unbelievable he was having the same problem a very dark screen. We both stood there puzzled, scratching our heads, when the truth hit me like a sledge hammer.

322,tilmonhocutt,Where to start on how many ways this was hosed.,2,19 September 2018,1) The timing. It is set in present day earth in a typical small town. The Original Alien movie was set well in the future.2) The Predator ship crashes and a few alien face huggers get lose. No sign of a n alien queen. So no eggs and no source of more face huggers other than the few shown on the Predator ship.3) Apparently THESE aliens grow to full size in about 15 minutes.4) Another Predator is sent from their home world to Earth to clean up. It gets there in less than a day.5) The Predator has a handy dandy blue fluid that melts bodies away to nothing with a few drops.6) Later in the movie the never ending supply of face huggers starts producing 3 to 4 aliens per victim vice one each. Of course even 3 or 4 per hugger is NOT enough to explain where all the Aliens came from. The town is crawling with dozens if not hundreds of them.7) The small town has a Nuclear Power Plant apparently IN the town. We only see a whole TWO employees. The Aliens and the Predator fight. The power plant gets shut down which blacks out the town. Then the power plant is completely ignored for the rest of the movie.8) The government decides to nuke the town to destroy the infestation.9) A few of the main characters get out on a chopper. The nuclear explosion does cause the chopper to crash but nobody on the chopper is hurt.There is much more but that is enough. for one review. Let us just leave it at the movie is god awful and apparently the people that made it NEVER saw any of the other Alien or Predator movies.,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
323,Aidonian,great movie,8,22 February 2008,"Alright, finally a AvP movie we can be proud of. It's full of action, gore since it is R -rated and good battles between aliens and the Predator. The Strauss brothers did a great job at it. There is no stupid plot to explain the presence of the Predators on Earth or why they are even there. It begins where the first movie left of and is a fun ride. What's interesting about this movie is, that it's more of a Predator movie than a Alien and Predator movie. No teenage predators this time, a full grown, experienced hunter hunting down the xenomorphs and the Predalien. What's also different this time is, that there is no queen. The Predalien seem to impregnate a host with a xenomorph through its mouth, making eggs and facehuggers redundant. The humans, well, who cares anyway. 24's Michelle Dessler is in the movie and does a great job at it. She is the mom who wants to protect her child, after her husband was killed by a xenomorph. Her character is somewhat similar to that of Ripley's in Aliens where she wants to protect Newt from the xenomorphs. Honestly, who watches these movies to care about the humans. The fact that humans keep winning is annoying at itself. The Predator was about the win, when the bomb was dropped, making it impossible to tell if the Predalien or the Predator won. That on itself was a grave error on the brothers part. If their intention was to let the Predator win, they should have him kill the Predalien and and escape the bomb somehow. I must admit, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, more than the first one, where music and the one battle scene where the highlights of the movie. Not to mention, this time, there is no stupid tag line saying: whoever wins, we lose and ironically we, as humans, win, while the Queen is frozen under water and the Predators sent to Earth were dead. Than again, Paul W.S. Anderson has a gift of destroying good franchises such as Resident evil movies, Alien vs Predator. He's not that bad as Uwe Boll, but he's getting close. If there comes a third Alien vs Predator movie, let's take it back to outer space or on another planet besides Earth like with the Alien saga. Sure the Predalian was a warrior in the games, but in the movie he's something else. All in all, a very entertaining movie worth watching and is much better than the first one.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Since it's an alien and predator film this doesn't really matter because you have to assume one of these title characters is dispatching the last human you've watched stumbling towards their doom but by that stage you've most likely figured out who everyone is and what they've gone on to do and stopped caring about what happens to them.

329,lanzman,I Want My Money and Time Back,1,26 December 2007,"Awful, dreadful flick. Did the production team see ANY of the preceding films in either series? Bad photography, horrid acting, 80s slasher movie clichés everywhere you look, and the dialogue sounded like it was written by a twelve-year-old who'd just seen an 80s action movie marathon.This movie could have and *should have* been so much more.How did the predator-alien manage to kill all the predators on their own ship? How did the ship land UNDETECTED in the US? Why did only ONE predator respond to the situation? Wouldn't a whole bunch of them want in on such a hunt? Where did the government guy come from? Why does a town with a major hospital have only two cops? WHY DID I WASTE MY TIME WITH THIS BOMB?!? I hope someone with some degree of talent gets to take a shot at AvP after this.

331,Joshua_Armell,0/10,1,4 December 2020,"I hate this movie. I hate it so much. Since words cannot describe how infuriated I currently am, here's a list of everything this movie screws up. The lighting is so awful most shots come off as silhouettes, the action and camerawork in general would be incoherent even if the lighting was passible, the sound design is lazy at best, the acting is plain bad, the callbacks and references are insulting, the creature design may even be decent if you could see it, the story is messy, the fight this is named after is likely the shortest of the entire movie, the list goes on.
But most of all, what I hate the most about this movie is the disgusting, disrespectful, sociopathic images it forces the audience to sit through.

332,LaserPoint,B-Movie with a high point,4,17 April 2010,"What to say about AVP.R, well, it achieved what AVP didn't and that was get the Predator design and vision mode right, as well as attach an R ratting which allowed the freedom for more blood and gore, unlike it's processor before it who sold out for a broader appeal. Anyway, aside from all that, ultimately it did fell like a B-Movie, which is a insult to both the Alien and Predator franchises; the characters were predictably weak and the plot was just plain garbage. Wolf, which is properly my second favorite Predator right after the original, was far to overpowered at times, since he seemed to kill Aliens with the flick of a risk, which isn't really fair to the Alien fans. It was also really dark at times which obviously made it difficult to outline what exactly was going on, especially during the fight scenes, which were great I might add.In closing: both AvPs are heavily flawed films with a long list of negatives and only a few positives. AVP:R slightly holds the advantage due to Wolf, but that isn't saying much since he was basically the only good thing about the movie. In my opinion, Both films deserved the bashing they have and always will receive, and I think most Alien and even Predator fans will agree with me when I say that the concept of crossing with Aliens and Predators should've never happened outside of comic books and video games. I guess you could argue the fact that if done by the right director with the right script and the right team, then it potentially could've been different, but we'll never know that now, unless they make a AVP3, but that wont be taken into consideration for a while yet.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

What Sci-fi movie doesn't have any flaws in the script? I agree that some things could have been better, like , why was the brother an ex- convict, it didn't add much to anything. But questioning why a Predator would use his shouldergun in his spaceship is just plain stupid.. It was it's only chance (one might say, he could have activated his bomb, but in my experience it still takes a few seconds to do that, and he only had one second). Well, things like that will always be around in any Sci-fi movie.It was too dark. Of course, nighttime adds some shock-effects, and rain just makes the situation look even worse, but boy, a bit more light would have been fun. I guess it was to cover up the low budget they spent on the CGI.I think AVP is a bit stuck. IMO, the problem is, none of them has any dialog. They HAVE to add humans, otherwise there is no speech or whatsoever. But humans don't add á-ny-thing to the AVP action. If there ever will be a sequel, I hope they will make a full-time war on some shitty planet between masses of Aliens and Predators. Give them all ranks, the higher-the bigger/cooler and somehow,somehow find away to add some dialog. Yeah.

From the opening scene where they actually show a nine-year-old boy have an alien burst out of his chest and blood and guts going everywhere to the ending scene with some stiff-ass government man holding some object or whatever from the whole incident that occurred in the small town where all the crap happened with the aliens and the predators, I was struck by fascination... fascination as to how the hell a movie could be so bad!

This piece of garbage makes the first one look like one of ""those classics"" you remember fondly. If 20th Century Fox wanted to utterly soil the reputation of the Alien and Predator movies, which shone in their own ways, THIS is the way to do it.I could proceed to write a lengthy and in-depth review of this .... thing, but there is no need to, because on further consideration, there IS no depth to this.

336,Dutch90,Garbage,3,28 April 2018,"While I don't agree with detractors of the first AVP movie from 2004, this one definitely deserves all the flak it gets. In just over 90 minutes, the Strause brothers manage to degrade some of cinema's most iconic sci-fi monsters to cheap fodder from a Syfy original film. Where did it all go wrong?First off, the Strauses have a background that is chiefy in SFX work, having worked on various high profile blockbusters such as Terminator 3, The Day After Tomorrow and Titanic. And it shows - SFX-wise, AVP:R, like its predecessor, looks about thrice as expensive a it actually cost. The CGI and animatronics are top notch, the Predators look much more manacing than in the first AVP and we are even treated to a glimpse of their home planet. But while Alien and Predator definitely had good SFX, their strength was in their tense atmosphere, moody cinematography and the relatable characters. This made you really feel the terror of being hunted by a hostile extraterrestrial lifeform. In interviews, and on the Alien Experience forum that I was a member of at the time, the Strauses seemed to get this. For instance, they talked of the brother dynamic between Dallas and Ricky Howard, and Kelly O'Brien's experiences as a soldier in Iraq being important in shaping their character over the course of the film. Molly, Kelly's daughter, was an obvious attempt to emulate the Ripley/Newt dynamic from Aliens. However, all these promising words never made it into the actual product. The Strauses seem to think that talking in depth about their characters in interviews is the same as having well rounded characters in their film. But when nothing of this is actually seen or heard in the film, it becomes empty rhetoric. We see none of the brother dynamic between Dallas and Ricky, who are just stilted one-note characters distinguished only by their names and looks. Kelly and Molly are empty clones of Ripley and Newt, with none of their emotional resonance or determination. Hell, Kelly isn't even a badass like Ripley was in Aliens - you'd think that would have been the easiest to copy. The other character are equally one dimensional - the well-meaning sheriff, the weasel ('screw the woman and children first shit!'), the high school bully (who gets killed, of course).Then there are the creatures themselves. If the first AVP seemed biased towards the Aliens, with one Alien killing two of the three lead Predators within the space of several minutes, AVP:R goes to the opposite extreme: its lead Predator is the ultimate badass, mowing through hordes of Aliens like they're mere annoyances. Granted, Ripley dispatched quite some Aliens in the 1986 sequel, but there they still felt intimidating. Here, they're just B-grade screechy movie monsters. The human deaths are over-the-top and unimaginitive - it's as if the Strauses saw the criticism of AVP's PG-13 rating as that film's chief mistake, and set out to make AVP:R the polar opposite. As a result, AVP:R turns the Aliens and Predators into Freddy and Jason, brutally killing humans in cheesy slasher flick fashion. While the Predators definitely look great, the Aliens suffer by comparison. This is mainly due to the introduction of the Predalien. While the Alien/Predator hybrid (or rather, an Alien with Predator characteristics due to having a Predator host) is a staple of AVP lore and should definitely be included in any film adaptation, AVP:R's Predalien just looks silly with its overdone pecs (seriously, pecs on an Alien? What is this, a cartoon?) and oddly draped dreadlocks. Also, AVP:R tries to 'expand' the Alien mythos by introducing yet another form of reproduction, after the classic life cycle, the 'eggmorphing' from the Alien Director's Cut and the live birth from Alien: Resurrection - the Predalien, supposedly a young Queen, vomits embryos into victims' throats as it cannot yet lay eggs, and these then burst from the victim's belly. Yes, you read this correctly. If the Facehugger is meant to symbolize oral rape, I don't want to know what the Strauses were thinking of when designing this. Anyway, this 'let's make it as disgusting as possible' mentality is clearly played only for shock value and ends up turning the Alien's life cycle into a parody of itself.The film tops it off with the introduction of the Yutani Corporation, the other half of Alien's Weyland-Yutani after the first AVP gave us Weyland Industries, vaguely linked to Predator 2's 'OWLF' group. While this is interesying, it goes nowhere, vaguely hinting at a sequel that never materialized, and just comes off as C-grade 'there's a bigger ploy' evil company diatribe that we've all seen before a thousand times.In sum, AVP:R is a definite low point for both franchises, which were thankfully elevated by Predators, Prometheus and Alien: Covenant in recent years. The Strauses have displayed a fundamental lack of knowledge and skill in crafting a good Alien/Predator film, or a good film in general, and show little skill in filmmaking beyond SFX work. Besides the nonexistent pace, one-dimensional characters, lack of any kind of plot beats (once the action starts, it's basically a one-way street to the conclusion - running from warring extraterrestrials, not much else) and B-grade treatment of its titular monsters, the film is also poorly lit, making much of the action hard to see. All it deserves credits for is the SFX work and the design of the Predator. The Strauses seem to have realized their limits, or at least Hollywood has, seeing as they returned to SFX work after making one more movie post-AVP:R (the interesting but ultimately underwhelming Skyline).

The predator is a bit unskilful, he makes mistakes that a Hunter shouldn't: sometimes he recognizes that there are Aliens around him when they already attacked him. If it happens in the real world, he could be killed at least five times during the film. The aliens grow up too quick just as in part one.

342,Krakn3Dfx,More like AvP: Repulsive,1,28 December 2007,"Maybe I'm just old, or I haven't been around much... I've always been a big fan of the Alien and Predator films, and I even liked the original Alien vs. Predator. Both franchises offer cool characters and appealing story lines. I've been looking forward to AvP:R since I heard about it earlier this year. I'm 35, a father of two, think I'm pretty liberal about life in general, don't mind gore in my movies, don't mind a lot of violence. But what does bother me as an adult with kids, which, apparently was missed by the makers of this movie, should be their target audience, since the height of the Alien and Predator craze was when I was in grade school, is when film makers create tasteless scenes just for the sake of being tasteless. The first scene I'm referring to is the 8 year old boy chest burster scene at the beginning. It would have been easy enough to have two adult men, but for some reason, the shock value in watching an 8 year old die horribly on the big screen seems to get the film makers off enough that they couldn't resist. Then you have the scene, which, while you don't actually see it happening, implies the slaughter of an entire nursery of babies at a hospital. Disgusting and again, not necessary except to get off 14 year old boys who are already desensitized enough by the world in general, and apparently the people who wrote and directed the film. There was at some point, whether it was enforced or just an unspoken rule that Hollywood followed, a rule that kept the killing of children, implied or otherwise, out of television and movies. Apparently that rule has been abandoned completely, from the scene at the beginning of the Battlestar Gallactica mini-series where the lady breaks the baby's neck in the carriage, to the slaughter of the young Jedis in Revenge of the Sith, to now AvP:R. If you consider yourself a responsible parent and a decent human being in general, I would avoid this movie and let others know as well.

343,bobfingerman,AVP: Obituary,1,15 April 2008,"Unbelievable. Really, unbelievable. It's shocking how bad this movie is. The awfulness actually made me tense, and I doubt that was the kind of tension the filmmakers were hoping to foster in an audience. Shane Salerno's hackneyed screenplay is riddled with stolen moments, clichés and the worst dialogue I've encountered in a very long while. ""AVP: Requiem"" is a movie populated by flimsy archetypes and all are lazily wrought.Cinematographer Daniel Pearl has done a remarkable job of obscuring the action in every single scene, making it nigh on impossible to follow the action or know who's doing what to whom (or what). Doesn't matter; it's not like there's a plot or characters or anything to care about. Even the much ballyhooed gore is clouded. The Strause Brothersforgive me; I mean ""The Brothers Strause""should stick to special effects and leave directing to directors. Given their SFX background one would think their feature debut would be a special effects showcase, but as I've noted, the entire production is a murky wash of glistening mud.I saw ""Alien"" during its original release in 1979 and was beyond wowed by it. I was in junior high school and it left an indelible mark, not only as a scarefest, but as an exemplar of both the sci-fi and horror genre. It was made by a consummate craftsman, Ridley Scott, and elevated the scripted material (basically a solid ""B"" monster in space movie) to art. ""AVP: Requiem"" diminishes the franchise to less than a terrible ""B"" monster movie; it's garbage. Bury it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

It's just NOT SPOOKY enough! I mean, who did this movie??? It seems like the director have never seen an Alien or a Predator movie, or was watching too much sci-fi channel junk.1st Alien on a spaceship, with visuals way ahead of their time. 2nd Alien on an alien planet, packed with action, massacre. 3rd Alien on Earth, but in an isolated prison packed with sick dudes, dark and chilling backgrounds etc. 4th Alien in a experiment facility far from the average humans, we have a pack of sick space pirates here, with a sick twist of kidnapping people to harvest aliens etc...1st predator deep in a jungle, spooky and not average at all 2nd predator in a crime infested town packed with crazy gangsters and the finale on a Predator spaceship.. great!1st Alien vs Predator deep under ice in an ancient underground pyramid complex built thousands of years ago for the deadly game of cat and mouse... sick!that's what created the suspense and the feeling of excitement in these movies, that's what made them seem interesting..just like the video games.. it made the people see and experience something new throughout the movies.

This sequel makes the original look like Citizen Kane in comparison. I had lowered expectations going into see the film, but was hopeful in hearing that this AVP run was going to be darker and gorier than the first movie. It doesn't disappoint in that factor: plenty of slime, blood and guts to go around. But the movie has a slight mean streak, considering young children are fair game to the Aliens, as are expecting mothers. It's one thing to imply such violence, but another to show it.There are so many plot holes here that it boggles the mind how the script even got the go ahead. If this is the kind of dreck the WGA is striking over, well, let's say I don't have much sympathy. The Predator had some nice new additions to his artillery, including a razor whip and some magical blue goo that melts anything it comes in contact with. But the problem with the Predator here is that he comes onto the scene as a kind of ""cleaner"" intending to wipe out the Alien scourge and wipe out any evidence of their existence. Yet, despite his careful intention to cover his and the Aliens' tracks, he blows through town like John Rambo in First Blood. Not to mention none of the unnecessary human characters aren't remotely interesting or worth investing any kind of audience sympathy, everything is so dark, you can rarely tell what is going on most of the time anyway.I say take this franchise to an animated medium, take away the human characters, and let these iconic aliens really duke it out once and for.

The story does not slow down to let ""newcomers"" on board and has not been softened to avoid offending any sensibilities. If you are not a hardcore fan who is familiar with the details of both creatures, you will miss >70% of what is going on. But the movie is enjoyable even as a mere action-horror movie and the entire gang with whom I watched the show claimed to have enjoyed it.I was happy to note that the directors did not resort to the ""jerky camera"" crutch that more and more filmmakers use these days. My feeling is that the ""jerky camera"" is used primarily to gloss over poor production values and weak storytelling, and weaker acting. Its merciful absence here is probably because the target audience includes the original ""Alien"" fans who are probably in their 40s now. If anything, the movie was a bit too short. Several scenes fairly flew by with their implications insufficiently highlighted. The director seemed to make the keeping the film length under 90 minutes an absolute priority.

The lack of the r rating really showed, the whole story line was just ridiculous, and just the shear fact that a squad of predators(you know, those aliens who are just light years past our own civilization who can go invisible due to there technology)just get wiped out with in 10 minutes.This movie had heart something the other one did not have. Like the other movie the film lacked a decent story line. this film at times felt like a teenage slasher movie with a sci fi twist more then an alien or a predator. I think it is needless to say that after you see this movie you realize how much Arnold's presence and or sigorney weaver are needed. One thing i did not like was the theme of being in modern time rather then the future. I found this to be a flaw with the first movie. This film does have good things but the main problems are the acting and the cheesy story line. It was obvious to see that these directors were serious fans of aliens and predator considering there are about 5 times that they pay tribute to the two movies.All in all the movie has something to offer unlike the first.

The virtual lack of a story was compounded by huge gaping plot holes, wretched acting, banal writing and the whole thing was so dark, you could see what was going on.They could have taken this story to so many different levels. In my opinion, there should have been more collaboration between humans and predators after the forced alliance in the first one. We should have been allowed to go on board the Predator's ship and see some of the cool advanced technology. Maybe they show us a film clip of their history and how the Earth has been a staging area for past battles. Maybe the Predators were behind the pyramids and they'd been coming here for millenniums. Maybe the Predators were somehow behind the Bermuda Triangle.I don't know, but the thrown together hack job that I saw was a complete waste of time.

You're not getting the best of the best here, but as it is, this is a very entertaining ride with decent replay value.The story has been gone over so I'll just voice my opinion on it. Pretty much everything in the movie is spot-on, the location is good, the acting is good, the script is decent and the characters are mostly likable or hateable.Aside from just the action, there is quite a bit of horror and gore to this take on the alien and predator universes. Alien normally relies on suspense, predator on action. In this one however showcases the true savagery and ruthlessness of the alien as they proceed to infect or mutilate even the most helpless and innocent characters that are normally spared in other monster movies. A truly refreshing yet disturbing device that is not often witnessed.The only place where it falls down (and I don't think I've ever said this before) is editing. The story tends to jump around a bit too much and it becomes a noticeable distraction to continuity, there are too many random cuts to short, pointless and unnecessary scenes.I wish I saw this in the theater but in retrospect it would have definitely been worthwhile. The effect of the movie is lost on a smaller screen.Worth a watch, you probably won't regret it if you've liked any of the alien or predator movies.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
352,pritish-sai,The Worst of the Series with good CGI,4,23 March 2008,"This is another example which shows why new directors today focus more on the box office than critical acclaim. The aliens n predator franchises have sprawled brilliant movies n sequels with some of the most critically acclaimed directors of all time n when avp surfaced the worst had yet to come. AVPR is a movie that will completely offend hardcore alien n predator fans (moi included ) mainly because the directors feel obliged to throw whatever crap they want on screen and bend all the rules of the alien ,predator universe as an excuse to throw buckets of blood and guts on screen.I will not write a spoiler but rest assured the story ....well there was no story at all. This time it dozen;t take place in space or a pyramid but in some town in America.I ll give you 5 reasons 2 avoid this movie.1) In aliens you had hardened marines fight aliens with futuristic hardcore weapons. In this movie you have townsfolk fighting them with some store guns. And worse the directors wanted to use an 'Ellen Ripley' like character like cameron did in aliens. They failed badly.2) Basic rules. Predators don't harm unarmed ,pregnant or weakened humans. Only a facehugger can implant eggs into a living host ,not a full grown alien. chestbusters need to feed and take time 2 mature into an adult. All these rules are omitted.3) Terrible ,Terrible story . Alien ,Aliens n Predator 1 n 2 had a main story which involved subjects ranging from excavation, industrialization, Rescue missions n Gang wars. This has NO story.4)There Is ONE predator in the main movie and he's some sort of cleaner.5)The aliens have been brought from gigantic spaceships ,labs,planet surfaces to hotel kitchens n people's house NUTSHELL We need a REAL avp movie.. THis is not that. Best avoided",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

The characters believable as they might be don't fit the film. It seems that the cast seems almost more set for a TV type setting then a movie. The flirty girl, the mom coping for the love of her daughter, the desperate housewife fearing the worst when her husband goes missingall modern drama you would find in today's TV pop serious.

Its not a whodunnit its a whogetsit.Except that you know who'll die, where when and how.Acting is not good but the whole thing is so darkly lit that I couldn't follow what was happening.What is the point of spending millions on special effects of two famous monsters if you can't see them.AS for humour, well I did laugh during the film but I'm not sure I was meant to.if they had followed the guidelines of the first one they might have had something but this just kills 2 great movie series with one poor flick.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
356,squicker,Pants,1,19 January 2008,"Well done Fox; you have two of the best franchises in movie history, both with loads of kudos that have started massive acting careers and had some amazing directors at the helm, and what do you do? After making a pigs ear of AVP1 you hand direction for number 2 to what must be the two biggest boneheads in the film industry. Absolutely genius.These two Strand brothers couldn't organise a trip to the cornershop, let alone direct a heavyweight sci-fi film. Together these total imbeciles have destroyed all future Alien or Predator variants, and certainly damaged the preceding films, for a lot of people anyway. The only way an Alien or Predator fan can protect the previous films in each series is to pretend this film has never happened. If you even imagine it as a stand alone movie it is so appallingly bad the taste it leaves in your mouth will last forever. It is so bad you cannot even watch for MST3000 style humour value. It really is a steaming dog turd of a film.Reasons (without going into spoiler detail, although how you 'spoil' a turd such as this is open to debate: Plot inconsistency with previous Alien, Predator and AVP film(s). The Strudel sisters must never have seen another film from the series, but handed research over to some spotty 16 year old oik to do, who evidently sat back getting stoned with his dweeby mates instead of checking out core facts about the universe of both entities.Laughable monsters. Not just bad FX but non-scary very thick monsters of both breeds (not to mention the humans who are brain dead twits of the highest order, one suspects in real life too - due to them acting so badly or even accepting such a dire script). Whereas both the alien and the predator are cunning and genuinely frightening creatures in previous movies (including AVP1 to a certain degree), the idiots depicted here are throwaway mindless cretins that bumble around the cardboard sets with no direction. Probably because the 'directors' cannot direct.No character development. All previous films in the franchises have a smaller number of human protagonists that have characters, developed to a greater or lesser degree. Here we get weak, watery eyed pea-brains whose names you cannot even remember, least of all care about their life expectancy.No strong plot yet loads of weak story lines. You cannot concentrate on the 'story' due to the fact it flits about from scene to scene without ever delivering a cogent thread to follow.Poor cinematography. You ended up bored witless, staring at the exit light in the cinema for amusement rather than the screen that just flashes and jitters about like a very poor MTV music video.No real suspense. Instead of the nail biting suspense of Predator, Alien, Aliens et al, there are moments that the directors evidently feel are 'pushing the envelope', more like pushing out a giant turd. The moments don't come across as sick, frightening or suspenseful. More like the fake shocks of an unruly teenage punk who plays his Anti-nowhere League records too loud to annoy his middle class parents. Tiresome but never shocking.I can't be bothered to go on, but see this film at your peril. It's a huge mound of faeces the Twit Twins have unleashed here, and just remember...You cannot polish a turd.Ben",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
357,sebbystone1,"While easily one of the franchises worst, AVPR isn't a total disaster.",2,17 June 2015,"I agree that this is no great film, as you can see from my score of 4. The acting isn't great, the cinematography and lighting is some of the worst I have seen in a while, and the story is meh. There are some elements of the film which I just couldn't buy. The love between the pizza boy and his sort-of girlfriend wasn't my idea of fun, and to be honest, this is a disturbing movie. This is far grimmer than Predator or Aliens, and even Alien 3 is a more cheerful movie. I came to watch a predator fight hordes of aliens for 1.5 hours, not to watch 8 year old boys explode in my face. Some of the deaths don't make me want to scream, but to get off of my sofa and stop watching it purely out of disgust. Well, that's the rant out of the way, does AVPR have its merits? Well, yes. The sewer scene where two characters look for some keys in total darkness is my favorite scene from the film, and one of the scariest moments in the franchise (after the chase from Predator 2, and Alien. As in the whole thing.) There's some nice action and effects, and the R rating does help (however, I live in the UK, where both AVP movies are rated 15+, so the first was a weak R equivalent for us). It deserves its rotten, but I don't believe its as bad as many say it is. If you just want to hear (you can't see) a predator killing Aliens and Aliens killing people, its worth a rent.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
358,CaZSuede,Stupidity Incarnate.,2,27 December 2007,"There have been some good brother partnerships in the past. The Coen Brothers, the Wachowski's and the Hughes Brothers. The collaboration of siblings can add a dynamic element to the movie.The Strause brothers are not one of them.AVP-R was a mess. First of all it makes no sense. It takes place at the end of the first movie where this ""A-P hybrid"" is born (which is funny because in no where in the alien franchise has an alien hybrid mutated naturally), but when the dread locked superhunter sends out a distress signal, it get's the attention of just one Predator.Even Danny Glover got more respect out of it. Of course, this hybrid is also a hybrid warrior-queen because it can lay it's own eggs, but for some reason, none of their offspring are hybrids, nor are they human-alien-predator hybrids, since pregnant women seems to be it's preferred burrowing hole it's gut pounding children.Take that an a super-lame story of two brothers (of which there is a ""Transformers"" like subplot between one of the brothers and a Megan Fox wannabee with her jock boyfriend) who are on the wrong side of the law, but loved by the Sheriff (for some reason) and a paper thin attempt at emotion involving a soldier (why did Reiko, who was awesome in 24, take this role?) and her daughter and you have a movie that has no real plot. Add to this, some shady CIA type character, who just decides to nuke the whole town and then steal technology to give to a corporation seemed completely lame and unbelievable (I guess the President didn't want to be desired).Even the predator, who acts like a member of CSI should have had the common sense to just nuke these sad characters from space and be done with it.However, this was not the only problem with the movie. They really needed a lighting crew for this movie, cause they were not working in this movie. Everything was extremely dark and half the time, you didn't know what you were looking at and creatures are in darkness.This is not helped by the fact that the editor of this movie had ADD. Compound this with two directors who don't seem to know how to direct an action scene (I mean W.S Anderson is a genius compared to these two) nor create any type of atmosphere, tension or dramatic effect and you are left with a movie that is flatter than a piece of sheet glass.But the worst is the acting in this movie. Even given the fact that these ""actors"" were given jack to work with, the acting hits a razzy low with this. I mean, where the brothers recruited from a local Century City Starbucks? They have no inkling of acting, or trying to act. Even worse is the Sheriff, who gives the worst job this year as an actor portraying law enforcement.And the ending....Like the first movie AVP, they try to get the Alient Quadrilogy association by including the Yutani corporation (Ellen Ripley was employed by the Yutani-Weyland Corporation), but seems like it was a cheap add in to end the movie. It's so eighties when they actually have a company that is named after an actual owner. Yutani Industries I'm sure what the company is called.Please skip this movie, it is not worth your time. It has it's place with other lousy sequels like Saw 4, Hostel 2 and The Hills have eyes 2.A place away from your eyes.

360,Vantec,Where franchises go when they die.,3,2 February 2008,"AVP-R's starting point is its predecessor's joke ending. The new Predator/Alien hybrid kills the departing ship's crew, causing it to crash back to Earth near a mid-West American town. The hybrid survives to escape the wreckage. On the home planet, a Predator remotely watching events unfold heads for Earth to hunt its new prey. Their battle soon engulfs the town. Unfortunately instead of checking the taps before leaving our sentient interstellar warrior forgets to pack weapons, giving the filmmakers an opportunity to pad time and relive one of many AVP scenes as it arms itself from the crashed ship. Fans of the original Predator administering field medical and trailing phosphorescent green blood get the chance to see it again verbatim too. Maybe enjoyed the discarding of armor and face shield to fight Arnold man-to-bug? You're in luck, it's here too. Skinned soldiers? At first diligent to destroy any evidence of an alien presence with a bottomless bottle of phosphorescent blue 'acid', this Predator couldn't resist taking one human trophy and leaving the carcass hung like a big neon sign. Nor could the film makers. Unbelievable plot elements and scenes lifted wholesale from previous installments prove central motifs for AVP-R. That is until the writers tire of stealing from earlier films and start mining stock clichés. Teen angst, teen romance, teen rivalry, big brother back in town fresh from prison and 'cigarette man' conniving government officials all do duty. The few novelties are often repugnant and adolescent; lurid close-up broods of screeching aliens bursting from bellies of hospitalized expectant mothers for example. Lovingly rendered in Walmart CGI, AVP-R stands low as the uncontested worst of either franchise and arguably the nail in this offshoot's coffin. One can only hope it proves so to the careers of those who dropped this cynical by-the-numbers bomb on the public.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

It's not even close to being better than the first AVP in any way. The direction was horrible, the acting was horrible, the plot was horrible, the special effects were horrible. This movie is the kind of stuff Uwe Boll directs. The Brothers Strause are just as horrible at directing as he is. I wonder how these guys seriously get hired to do these movies; how can a corporation like Fox let these guys ruin a classic series? I can not display my major disappointment with this movie it was a depressing film to watch and turned a classic series into a B movie.Spoilers: Yes they brought back the gore the first was missing but they made it too cheesy. Seriously the alien acid was overexagerated in Aliens Hicks gets sprayed with some acid on his arm and it of course burns through but he still has an arm. In this some guy gets a little splatter of acid and his arm falls off. The gore wasn't good it turned the movie into something more comical than serious and what was with the birthing scene, that was probably one of the cheesiest scenes I've ever seen in any film in my life.A classic movie ruined Resurrection was bad but it was watchable and at least held interest this movie just doesn't hold anything at all.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Having seen the trailers, I must admit that I built up a healthy anticipation for it's release but, in my opinion, it just didn't live up to the promise contained in those trailers.Yes, it is much better than it's predecessor, but that's not really saying much, is it? The characters were well drawn out, for the most part. In fact, it might even be said that too much time was devoted to fleshing out some of the characters who, in essence, were only there to become fodder for the aliens later in the film. The first half, though interspersed with the activities of the aliens and/or Predator, added little to the film, as a whole. While I appreciate the effort made to give us some background on the people we are supposed to care about, it didn't really work for me. In fact, I found that I felt worse for a few characters that were only on screen for a couple of minutes when they met their demise.In the end, it is definitely a watchable film. One that I surely wouldn't mind seeing again, at some point. What's disappointing to me is that is could have, and probable should have, been a whole lot better. The storyline was decent enough; the actors played their roles as well as could have been expected; and the action scenes were handled very well. Still, I walked out of the theater feeling as if a whole lot was missing from the experience. Had they tightened things up a bit, this one could've been great.

363,djeb2004,Fun Movie that pays homeage to the creatures.... somewhat,8,14 July 2009,"I am a huge aliens and predator fan. Aliens is my favorite movie of all time. So going into this movie I am a little biased. However there is a point where you have to draw the line. The biggest, i mean biggest flaw in this movie was the script. When Ricky walked into Jessies house and Dale says nice outfit and his friend goes, yeah isn't halloween in October. I knew that the script in this movie was dead. However Ricky's comeback was quite nice in response, well at least I know who ordered the sausage lovers. The rest of the dialog was absolute horrible, which isn't the actors fault, I blame Shane Solerno, the credited writer for this movie. I must say A++++ to the actors having to work with this script. The acting wasn't that bad in this movie. There is much more good then there is bad in this movie. The creature effects were top notch. The overall special effects were great. The movie seemed to get its point across pretty well even though it seemed to run short. I think this could have been a great 2+ hour long movie. Nice touches including the alien sounds from James Camerons Aliens, the original predator vision sounds, and original soundtrack themes hidden within the movie were great touches. I think they could have done better with the predator clicking noises and predator roars and growls. I'm glad they made this predator a more kick ass predator instead of a soft emotional and weak predator as in the first one. The only thing that upset me about the predator is that it wouldn't kill the main characters even when it had plenty of chances to. If a non main character came up it would have no problem slaughtering that person. Another thing that was great in this movie, was the predator face. It looked great. It looked more the like the predator from the original which was awesome. The aliens looked good since they followed the ridged head design and looked more like insects than men in suits. The predalien was a cool twist, I think they could have designed it alittle better to look scarier but it wasn't too bad. The end fight sequence was excellent but way to short. Overall the movie was good, if you are an alien or predator fan you will enjoy it. It has many flaws but a lot of good. I give it an 8 out of 10.

Where to begin?,1,15 February 2014,"I believe 'Aliens vs Predator 2' is the worst film I've seen in a cinema and for good reason.The acting is bad, the lightning is bad, the story is bad, script makes no sense, it makes the first movie (by Anderson) seem like a masterpiece.The main problem is the studio choice of going with some MTV directors and throwing in teen drama in the 'AvP' universe. Completely outlandish, uncalled for, incompatible to no end. There's no suspense and hardly any horror, only some gore (rather over the top and grotesque, I will add). Most times in the action scenes the shaky camera and darkness makes it hard to tell what's going on. Very flawed.All in all, reusing the popular creatures and throwing in some mindless action does not make a movie and as the previous movies (even including AvP 1) all focused more on intelligent plots, suspense and horror, 'AvP 2' fails in every aspect.

The dialogue was laim and the acting not much better. And why is it that in every movie that has some one with military experience they always knows how to fly a helicopter? That is pretty un-realistic. Sure Kelly may have been an Iraqui or Afganhistan vet, but she could have been a supply tech for all we know and what government is going to spend thousands of dollars to train a non com flunky to fly a helicopter.

Cool visuals and gory killings (sheesh, were they gory!).But I have to admit that a lot of what people are saying here is true. Weak story, very derivative of all the Alien and Predator movies, and the lighting was flat out terrible. You never, ever get a good look at the alien or the predator. And that for me is a huge disappointment.It is very similar to a slasher flick set-up, what with the teens and the predictable victim count. Funny things is though, I was kinda entertained by that.Some of the cgi was truly great. The alien swimming under the water looked better than the the one in Alien Resurrection, but too dark. This is a gory film! Very outrageous in places. Fits right in with the ""slasher film"" tone.I totally appreciated some of the humor. Corny but fun. And I think the filmmakers intentionally paid homage to all the films in their respective series. From music, to story concepts, to shot blocking, I think there's a subtle nod to all the previous films in many scenes, and I really enjoyed noticing those touches.I went in not expecting Alien 5 or Predator 3, and I got AVP that was 100 times better than the original AVP. Back in the 80's when we first got a glimpse of an Alien skull in the Predator ship, I remember thinking how awesome it would be to see these 2 screen icons battle it out.

To hit the themes and feel of the originals, the Brothers Strauss did a pretty damn good job. People complain of lack of story, but think back to say, Alien- An alien hops on board and kills people. Aliens- Marines go to rescue people from aliens. OK? Predator- A Predator stalks and kills some elite warriors in a jungle, ...So its not all in the story, but the presentation and production. Did AVPR deliver some very cool visuals, hell yes, I am a huge fan of the originals, and they not only paid homage but added the same music that made the first ones so good. The violence wasn't toned down for 13 yr olds like the first AVPR, OK, another improvement. Yes the film was a bit too dark in certain scenes, but it added to the tension in this movie, go back and watch the first Alien, very dark, and again, on purpose. When I first saw AVP ( the first one) I was appalled, they obeyed no rules of the previous films, they toned down the violence to that of a teletubbies episode, and the Predators looked like body builders, swollen and beefed up waaay too much. Now in this installment, things were done right, the predators looked great, like in the original, not over done with stupid weapons. The aliens looked great, more like the ones in Aliens. The Pred-Alien was a great little addition, much better than the half breed thing in Alien 4. It added a new element of undiscovered country, that a film like AVPR should do, to push boundaries. If the film just did the same things over again, it would have become too tired. I also liked the fact they brought the Weiland-Yutani Corp into the picture, reinstating the fact that this film takes place decades and decades before the first Alien.Over all this film was a huge raise on the bar over the first AVP, which should have never been made by such a flashy and uneducated directer. They made this movie for fans, as I am one and was rooting for the Predator to rip out some Alien tongues. They did not make this for bitchy little fans who have forgotten what the entire franchise was all about. Sitting back, enjoying the suspense and picking someone to root for, thats why these movies are made, not for critics to tear part the lack of storyline or unworthy Oscar performances ( remember, Sigourney was an unknown in the first one, and Arnie is missing a best actor statue). So to all the pms-ing fan boys who got a little 'perturbed' and thought this was 'atrocious', go back and watch Alien 4 and Predator 2, because neither are as good as this film, then go watch Star Wars Ep 1 and do all the bitching you want, thats where it belongs, cheers.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

The first part of the film plays out like the set-up to every dumb high school slasher movie ever made...except that even Friday the 13th series had better acting When the movie get's going..it seems like the director and writer transplant entire scenes from the first 3 Alien movies into a contemporary setting...the medical bay scene from Alien 3, the alien swimming scene from 4. This seems to be the whole structure of the movie.Rip off scenes from Outbreak..Dawn of the Dead and you almost have a complete mess of a story. Oh, and the scriptwriter runs on the premise...when you get stuck..blow something up.And forget adhering to any mythology of the series. If you think Paul Anderson took liberties with the incubation period..wait till you see this movie.Also..the movie has one very offensive sequence..shame on the film makers.I give it 2 because the scenes involving the predator investigating the alien infestation are really well done and interesting. Makes me think the film could have been done from this point of view...which would have eliminated the god-awful character development at the beginning of the film. Maybe combining this with flashbacks via the predator hacking into security (oh how video game like) cameras would have created more tension and scares...For the most part AVP 2 is just a gorefest end kdc",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

STOP ruining the classics.And when I say classics, I mean it. Maybe Predator and Alien aren't deep and well thought psychological characters, maybe their first movies weren't examples of cinematography, but at the genre that they were created for, they indeed were classics.Personally I don't like Alien, non of the series, they are not scary for me, they are disgusting, but I respect original Alien. For people who likes it, it fits the role perfectly.I was more of a fan of Preddie-guy... I was a child when first Predator came out and it was second film that I saw with Arnie in it (first was Commando)... So I was excited, and when you are excited by something in your childhood, this feeling goes with you all your life, even when you grow up for things like that. So I love predator. He's cool, strong, wild...Then came Predator 2 and of course it wasn't as great as first one, but Glover is indeed a great actor and he saves the film, together with some well developed plot... After seeing predator in jungles, we see him in a big city, and this unexpected twist works there...I won't say much about Alien series, as I said, not a big fan and don't even remember what's going on in each one of them, though I think I HAVE seen all...Then came that piece of crap, Alien VS Predator... but here, maybe I can understand creators of the movie in one point: bunch of guys without imagination and their own view decided to make a quick money, sit down and think.One of them said: ""Hey, guys, let's make something like predator..."" then another replied: ""noo, man, aliens are cooler..."" first one didn't accept - ""no"" - he said - ""my predator will beat your alien..."" and third one said: ""let's check it.""Of course idea of two great villains fighting each other sounded good, but everyone have seen what a piece of garbage came out...and AFTER such a fail... they decided to make this kind of crap... no! even worse crap then that...Maybe I didn't say much about the movie itself, I more criticized the concept of ruining classics, but you will find about movie in other reviews... avoid this film, you will be disappointed... you will once see that guys in Hollywood used all their ""mana-power"" and fantasy and left it somewhere in the late 80s beginning of 90s...Nothing new again, but not good enough as old too",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Anyway getting to the point when i first watched Alien vs predator i thought it was decent, but this film is terrible. The ending was the most cheesiest piece of crap i had ever seen! Im not going to ruin the ending because there's nothing to ruin, but here it goes, ""They got the Predators Gun"" is all I'm going to say, and I'm going to argue with this because it looked like the machine gun did better.I also hate the fact that if this is AVP why are humans in it? Maybe if there were a few famous faces this would have been better, but there all typical American college students, You know? the sort who grow up to kill themselves, like the ones on Nickeloden.I could of made a better movie on a budget of less than a couple of million dollars, it was also a shame it was always dark in the film, because you could never see the action properly, don't watch this unless your 1. A die hard fan or 2. Braindead.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
375,frich71-1,waste your time and money on something else (spoilers),1,26 December 2007,"The review on the main page admits that the movie is horrible but that you should forgive it because it is nicely violent. No you shouldn't. There are spoilers at the end of this review but how I can ""spoil"" this rotten movie I have no idea. Even if you are a die hard Alien/Pred fan like I am wait for the DVD. It isn't worth a 3.99 rental either but you'll be much less inclined to truly hate this film if you pay that than 12 bucks or better per person plus concession purchases at a theater.In the theater I watched AVPr there were exactly two laughs, both by a girl sitting next to me. Other than that there was total silence throughout. No ooohs, or ""that was bad ass!"", nothing. Imagine being a patient on an operating table and just being given the anesthetic. Now you know what you'll feel like in the theater after the opening scene of AVPr.What was the budget on this movie? Like War of the Worlds, MI 3, and other f/x driven movies the director seems far more involved in what the CGI people can come up with than developing characters or a plot. Spielberg has tried and failed at this several times, usually with Tom Cruise. Sure the movies make money but should they? War of the Worlds and Minority Report had the budget to pay for a decent script, Tom Cruise et al, and SS himself but were still awful. I'm sure AVP wasted 90% of their budget on CG and had no choice but to hire any actor that would say yes even though the casting agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and picking actors at random.There is no tension developed in any scene so we are never close to being surprised. Who cares who gets killed? We didn't know any of them, we all know what happens when the lil aliens make their corporeal exit, we all know the blood is acid. In Alien, Aliens, 3, Resurrection, and even AVP the directors make use of the fact that the Aliens can think, can hide and can lay traps. This director decided that the Ridley Scott, James Cameron, and others were idiots for developing characters you actually want to see either live or get killed. In this installment you will never care who lives or dies, not a kid, a parent, a pregnant woman. The characters serve only one purpose in this movie, to die. The opening scenes establish the fact that the movie is going to be a predictable joke. The character development scenes mix clichés, bad humor, and bad acting and numb the viewer to the point where we really don't care if they get killed so long as they die in never before seen ways. But they don't. The director tried to make something different from those who preceded him in the Alien franchise but only succeeded in discarding the good parts of the first films, the human protagonists, and stealing the rest from other recent sci-fi films.There is not one original use of the either the Alien or Pred characters. The Pred actually has little trouble killing Aliens by the dozen even though the last movie led us to believe that Pred revered the Aliens as such a deadly foe that they used the killing of one as Rite of Passage. The AlienPred is never really developed as a fearsome creature. Its ability to inject parasites into a host is ripped from several different movies most recently probably was Hellboy where Samiel's dismembered tongue injected eggs into Hellboy or Doom where the mutated creatures would leave their tongues behind after they speared a victim's throat.Simply put we aren't given reason to care about anything in this movie. There is violence but it doesn't shock or surprise and is nothing that hasn't been seen in any of a hundred slasher flicks. The CG is OK and both species of alien are made to look and move as they have in movies past. But since the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad we kind of hope that they all die. The little girl was probably the best actor of the bunch but sadly we aren't made to care whether or not kids, women, or anyone else lives or dies. We just want the movie to end. Eventually it does but not before another stolen plot line from Resident Evil 2 has a nuke aim Gunnison's way to wipe out the ""infection"". And not before yet another stupid scene that is supposed to open the door for further sequels but does it? In a movie filled with bad scenes the worst may have been saved for last.Sorry for the repetition but everything bears repeating: bad script, no plot, unoriginal action scenes, uninspired direction, abysmal acting, decent f/x that were wasted because of the many flaws.I don't mind going to an indie film and being disappointed. The actors and directors and crew are probably getting their careers going and working on a shoestring budget. For a movie with this type of budget and hype I feel cheated along with disappointed. This movie is a painfully boring waste of time from the opening scene to closing credits. Sad to say that a preview of Hellboy 2 was the best part of AVPr and HB2 didn't even look that good.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

I love the original & the sequel to predator. I don't mind Aliens so im not that fussed on them. Anyways when i watched Alien vs Predator i was pretty much disappointed but i liked the fight scenes between predator & alien, i still would've gave avp 1 about a 6/10. So im thinking this new one will be good cause the trailers make it look very interesting, WOW, was i wrong avp 2 has to biggest the biggest garbage of a sequel to released in such a long time. The acting is garbage the dialogues are absolutely pathetic & even the fight scenes between Alien & predator are so mediocre. If anything the trailer has to be more entertaining than the movie itself. my personal rating has already been stated in my summary. All i can say is that this is very disappointing to all the fans out there. If you like this movie im glad you did, at you got you moneys worth. I definitely would not recommend this to anyone. both thumbs down.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
377,fasc,Huh?,5,29 December 2007,"By my count, there were at least half a dozen human story lines that belonged in a teenage drama, and one half-thought science-fiction action film tossed in between the various soap operas. Too many side characters and subplots (failed romance, town bullies, family conflicts, etc.) distracted significantly from why I went to this movie. Even my lads, who love anything with explosions and aliens, were wondering when we were going to get to the good parts. The pre-coda resolution (""Mommy!"") was so ham-handed that even my 12yo was rolling his eyes in disbelief.Apart from the excessive subplots, there was also the issue of going too far. For the first time we see a preteen get face-hugged and killed by an embryonic alien, which is just plain bad taste. I'm sure it's meant to set the stage ""we're not pulling any punches here,"" but the previously mentioned subplots knock the wind out of that premise. Later, the Predalien lays eggs inside a pregnant woman which magically erupt into alien larvae within minutes. The result is a bland enterprise punctuated by grotesque but ultimately tasteless violence against children--born and unborn.Third, the whole thing seems rushed. From the instantaneous birth and maturity of the various aliens to the underdeveloped subplots, there's just too much going too fast. The coda at the end with Mme. Yutani is more poor attempt at salvage than ominous foreshadow.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

379,Magic_Lantern,Entertaining but ultimately flawed,6,30 January 2008,"*This review does not contain any significant spoilers.*AVPR, a direct sequel to 2004's Alien Vs. Predator sees the return of the two most prolific extraterrestrials of the past few decades, as well as the new cross-breed, the ""Predalien"", the spawn of a Predator impregnated with an Alien egg, as introduced in the epilogue during the closing credits of the original AVP.Like the first, AVPR is also set on Earth, hence the corny tag-line ""In space, no one can hear you scream. On Earth, it won't matter"", playing on the infamous tag-line of Ridley Scott's sci-fi classic, Alien. Upon the birth of the Predalien, a Predator ship crash-lands on earth along with a bevy of face-hugger samples. Humans are used as Alien hosts and a Predator is sent to cover up the ensuing mess. What follows is a predictable yet action packed battle between the xenomorphs. However, taking place mostly in darkness, and considering the predictable over-editing, the action is significantly marred. The violence and gore has been ramped up since the edited down prequel but still fails to satisfy, the blood and gore feels excessive but the audience is never led to identify with or even like the two-dimensional characters, making their inevitable deaths neither shocking or unnerving.The plot is also thin, but sufficient to keep the audiences' interest throughout which is more than can be said for the acting ability of the mostly unknown cast. Performances are never over-acted but are noticeably wooden, particularly when contrasted with the casts of previous Alien and Predator movies including Sigourney Weaver, John Hurt and even, to a lesser extent, Arnold Schwarzenegger.On the other hand, the score is reasonable, taking notable samples and themes from the previous Predator movies and James Horner's military themed action pieces from Aliens, the second movie in its respective franchise.Despite its shortcomings, AVPR is undeniably entertaining and enjoyable to watch. I, being a huge fan of the Alien franchise could pick out numerous plot flaws and issues with the movie but I don't see the point when this movie clearly doesn't care about that. I had fun in the cinema but would suggest approaching with caution if you aren't a fan of fast-paced modern sci-fi films in the vein of Resident Evil and its sequels.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

It's backwoods USA as the setting of this titanic encounter between the frightening Predator and the Alien specimens.If you're a fan of either killing machine, you'll appreciate the special-effects wizardry that goes into films of this nature. The acting is sketchy at best and there's a heck of a lot of noise and pyrotechnical displays. If you can imagine a group of misdirected youths trying to steer clear of the worst fiends out there, you'll do well to understand this little New Year's flick.It's fast; it's furious and it is special-effects magic at its very best.

381,chrisalsop1213,What a waste of film...beyond brutal,2,2 January 2008,"AVPR is exactly that...a waste of good 35mm film. Directed by the Strauss bros. (Who the hell are the Strauss bros you ask? Directors of commercials and are self acclaimed SFX wizards. Not inspiring but at least they ain't Paul Anderson...back to him later) Now there are a bunch of reviews here claiming this to be a solid installment in the beloved Predator/Alien franchises. What the hell is wrong with you people??!!!! The story regarding the humans is beyond complicated for no damn reason. Note to the producers...NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE HUMANS!!!!!! So why then are there like 10 different story lines going on while the pretty solid story of the predators and aliens plays out? No idea. One reviewer here couldn't stop talking about all the gore and deaths etc and how it was rated R. ARE YOU JOKING??!! Lets count how many times the film cuts away instead of showing the death or how many times we see blood running down the window and or wall instead of some solid effects. Answer: TOO MANY!!! Was the cinematographer on crack or does he like not being able to see what's happening in a scene cuz it's too dark. And what's with this garbage trend of filming the entire fight scene super close-up??? Pssst, it means either your choreography and/or FX suck and that yer director(s) doesn't know what they're doing. I'm tired of asking the question ""Where the hell are these two characters in relation to each other?"" I want to know who is killing who. I don't want to see a barrage of close up action with music video editing. And by the way...talk about boring. The action is so few and far between and when there is action it's just brutal. Now lets clear something up. I love the predator. I could watch him do whatever cool stuff he does all day. But for Christ sake, why doesn't he kick ass? He's a supreme hunter!!! Yet for some reason, he can't sense an alien 6 inches to his left? CMON!! He should be dominating! and he should be invisible. I know, we want to see him but work it out...this is your job. Now we all know Paul Anderson is also an awful director and ruined the first movie. But the sad thing is that the first movie had more redeeming qualities than this waste. Better fight scenes, better story (I always liked the idea/story of the first one). Requiem has a few cool deaths and a couple of decent scenes and there's definitely production value but that ain't worth the price of admission or even a rental. Now don't think I'm some guy who doesn't dig these kind of movies, cuz I do and I don't want you to waste yer time with this one or fork over your money. Instead go rent the originals or even some classic B-movies like I come In Peace or From Beyond. Don't agree with me? Fair enough. I didn't like The 6th Day either.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
382,Simmy41,Whoever wins...we lose...again,1,2 February 2008,"When Paul W.S Anderson's atrocity that was AvP ended, it left us with the not so subtle hint of a possible sequel. Written by Shane Salerno, (unaccredited writer in the first one) the story tells how the little Predalien from AvP has all grown up, kills the crew of the Predator ship, causing it to crash in small town. The last surviving Predator launches a distress signal that alerts experienced hunter Wolf (names after Harvey Keitel in Pulp Fictionseriously) who comes to earth to cover up the mess. He does this with the help of a blue liquid that evaporates what it touches, but you don't need a lot of it. Throw in some dull stereotypes (good guy with dark past, hot girl, bully) with about as much depth as a piece of paper and your on your way to the worst film ever. However that's irrelevant right? It's about the fight between two of the most fearsome creatures ever put to film. Unfortunately this is done so atrociously, it almost (but not quite) appreciate Anderson's effort. The lighting is shambolic, clouding everything in darkness you actually think that there may be something wrong with the film. Also, it's very clear that directors The Brothers Strause favour the Predator. Wolf is the ultimate warrior, tooled up to the max, taking on an army of Aliens. Which is fine in itself but this isn't a Predator film, though you may think that 's Predator propaganda with how badly handled the Aliens are. They're a far cry from the fearsome creatures presented to us by Scott or Cameron. Instead we get the true meaning of the term cannon fodder. Add in plot holes such as changes in acid blood concentration depending on how important the character is and their inability to leave the town. A homage is a good thing however when half you film is made out of it, it looks pretty silly. Constantly using shots from other films is not homage, it's lazy. Then we're left with a pretty lacklustre ending, that offers nothing but a reminder that, again, the fans of both franchises have been shafted once again by Fox.

But hey, it doesn't seem like that is the point at all anyway. This movie has PLENTY of Aliens, an elite Predator and a disturbingly violent crossbreed of the two. In most movies the director has built up at least the slightest sense of sympathy for the poor sucker who's running from something. Watching AVPR, I just sat waiting for the next one to get slaughtered. Most of them, you actually WANT to die, simply because they are so annoying. You know something's wrong when the girl one of the main characters are in love with gets brutally cut in half by a flying blade and you think ""good riddance"" instead of ""NO!!!""... But by all means, if you simply want to turn off your brain and watch about 100 minutes of insane carnage with a ridiculous body-count, I couldn't think of anything better for you. In short, I would give a 10/10 for the pure bloodshed you want out of any Alien- or Predator movie, but a 0/10 for any depth and logical plot. So a 5/10 overall.

And had left a pretty nice cliffhanger too, for an obvious sequel.The sequel is a poor excuse for the murder of an entire town. I mean it is the bloodiest movie ever. from the obvious chest bursting to slice and dicing and to be finished whit a thermo-nuclear bomb !!!!! And the human variety, not from the predator spring-summer bracelet collection. I just don't get it.

In the other half it is turned into a cowboy of sort, wen it shoots whit that cannon from the hands. And that hybrid...The scene whit it and the pregnant lady was just sick and cheap. I guess that the filmmakers had something whit kids, because they are killing them pretty nicely.The movie is sick and cheap from top to bottom, but that scene in particular. And finally, what is the deal whit the cliffhanger left whit this movie? Is there a secret group? Who/what are they serving. Why does it leave an after-taste of a B class television show?

Any competent director would have shot in scenes at least bright enough that the audience can recognize who (or what) is fighting! AvP One didn't have this problem!

Most of the characters were far more interesting than the standard horror/sci-fi/action movie characters.People say the acting was bad...um what? The acting was good. I really think this is something people just throw out there to try and seem like they know what they are talking about.People say there was not enough story and all it was was monsters fighting.....do I really need to explain why that criticism is moronic?

The actors-if one can call them that- are paper cut outs and the best you can do with them as a audience is to place bets on who dies first.

I also experienced one editing miscue in the movie as well and it's in the part where a guy shuts his door but it doesn't sound like a door shutting all you here is a click. The acting was good but it could've been better. The thing I liked the most about this movie was the battles between the Aliens and the Predator and I would just say forget about crash landing in Colorado and instead go to a distant planet with no humans and let the aliens and predators battle it out and then you will have a good movie. I'm just saying that because I thought that they took too long introducing the characters. I felt that they got in the way of me seeing more of the Aliens and the Predator and getting in the way of having more action in the movie.

Apparently the director thought the previous film was too bright which took away from some of the suspense etc... Well this film had no suspense because you can't see it!Throw in the usual clichés, obligatory scantily clad women shots for no reason other than tickling the film makers obvious need to just have them in there for the sake of it (there may as well have been a strip joint cliche too) and you're on to a real doozy of a film.It's a miracle any further Alien or Predator movies have been made since.No, this review doesn't include spoilers.

And scenes shot in the pouring rain makes it harder to focus on what exactly is going on.Now I love bad horror as much as the next person, but the people who created this mess REALLY crossed a line when they had the Alien attack -- get ready for it -- a maternity ward! Seeing terrified end-term women screaming in terror as an Alien shoved its eggs down the throat of a woman close to giving birth ...UGH. One of the most repulsive things I have ever seen. This movie is an attempt to take the ideas of others, crank up the gross factor, and ultimately get your money. Don't fall for it.

And trust me, there was. There was a lot of Alien and Predator scenes, though not as many as in the first film. there was somewhat of a story in the movie, and the bloody, gory feel of an Alien/Predator movie is here. I do like the first one better, but this isn't a bad sequel. I actually enjoyed it a lot. out of all the previous ones, i think this feels most like Predator 2, which I liked.

398,hesdeadjim82,Nothing to write home about,6,26 January 2008,"The reviews regarding this flick state that it will leave a rather bad taste in your mouth. Does this film really deserve this ear bashing? It isn't an Oscar winning performance, perhaps not even worth a Nickelodeon award, but does deliver what you would expect.If you enter the cinema expecting a lot of Alien bashing, human slaughter and stereotypical American characters, you'll be satisfied with the result. I didn't expect much, and it does do a good job of keeping your eyes peeled to the screen.One thing that I and my film buddies saw is that it copies a lot of characters and plot from Aliens! Which we thought was a little cheeky! It had the potential to add a little extra to the ever growing Alien/Predator saga. Although, what helps to earn it points was the obvious connections it wrote in with the other Alien movies. The circle is now complete!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
399,Kefka_8203,Death of a trademark? ((May Contain Spoilers)),4,10 February 2008,"And here we are, the latest installation in the crossover of two great franchises. I love Predator, and like ALien 1+ Aliens. Alien 3 and Alien:Ressurrection could preferably be counted out from the Alien series. When I was a kid I got my hands of an AvP comic translated into Swedish, and I was hooked. It brought together what I feel is the essence of the two franchises, and added some great stuff. Especially the bad ass heroine that followed in the footsteps of Ripley. From there I tried to buy the AvP comics where I could, and I played both the PC games a lot when they arrived. From these sources I felt as if a great movie could have been made, either using the games ""stuck in the middle with you"" approach in space, or using the comics which quite often portrayed a strong female lead. AvP; THe movie part one tried to do this with it's main lead and managed to get glimpses of those moments I loved as a kid in. AvP:Requiem however...Fails in every way. The characters are dull to unlikeable, with only the female soldier trying to show some sort of possible background. The setting of the movie is quite interesting I suppose...But doesn't manage to make the pieces fit. It's not survival horror, as the first Alien movie is. It is not kick ass hardcore action as per Aliens...It is not kick ass action/brutal action such as Pred 1+2. Instead it's slasher meets first-person shooter meets Disaster Strikes, which in the end creates a mess of a movie with not real redeeming qualities. THe aliens are ugly and dull, and the predalien and it's tongue-rape abilities bore me. The pred is supposed to be some sort of bad ass ""cleaner"" but comes across as a inept rookie with a happy trigger finger. The only really fun part of the movie was those few times when I was surprised over the death of a character, like the kid in the beginning or the blonde girl. Overall my advice is: Rent Alien+Aliens and Pred 1+2 and watch them over a weekend. They're a heck of a lot more worth your time.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
400,Anrachman,It's look bad only if you compare it to the former movies,9,8 August 2017,"If you compare AVP Requiem to the former Aliens and Predators movies, yes, this movie is behind them. This movie is like an (expensive) B movie. Beside, AVP Requiem doesn't take place in giant futuristic spaceship or underground secret temple, but only in a simple small town neighborhood. This thing make this movie has different feel and atmosphere from its former movies. I found AVP Requiem is more similar to old-school monster movies like Tremor, Arachnophobia, Python, Ghostbusters, and Night of Living Dead. I think because of this ""disconnection"", many people (especially Aliens and Predators fans) very disappointed and decided to give a very low rating. Yes, I can understand that, BUT, if you're not comparing this movie with its former, AVP Requiem actually is a very good B movie. This movie is so exciting, the effects are good, the actings are okay, the quality is not crappy, so enjoyable to watch, so deserve more than just 4,7 stars.

401,seanjenson,Nothing to recommend here,2,9 August 2018,"His is a bad movie. You know a movie stinks when even the sub-par Alien vs Predator seems like a masterpiece juxtaposed with it. For one everything is so dark you cannot even see anything at all. The fight sequences (the only reason to even bother with this film) are badly staged and what is worse is that there is no coherence to the script. The actors-if one can call them that- are paper cut outs and the best you can do with them as a audience is to place bets on who dies first. At least the original AvP had some redeeming factors such as nice locations, good actors and something barely resembling a plot. This film has none of those.

Maybe the producers and director of this horrendous movie should have asked themselves that question before releasing it to an unsuspecting public. Ten minutes into the movie and I was asking myself the same question.There is really no plot to this film. We are introduced to several characters at the beginning and none of them is ever fully developed. The story line keeps jumping from one character's point of view to the next, with no real coherence to knit the overall fabric together. We really don't care one bit about any of these people as a result.This version brings nothing new to the table. We've seen it all before and it has been done infinitely better in previous incarnations. Exploding heads and mutilated bodies do not make up for the lack of intelligence and coherence, which this film sorely lacks. My advice to the Strause brothers: Find another line of work that does not require intellectual integrity as a prerequisite. And to Shane Salerno (writer): Do the same. As for you, Mr. Dan O'Bannon, your mind must have been elsewhere when you co-wrote this ridiculous script. Shame on you!

404,norton833,Shaky-Cam Shambles,3,30 December 2007,"Not only does this movie have stock teen characters, but for the first chunk of it, it felt like I was alternating between two films (""AVP"" and ""90210: The Movie"").There's this weird time-compression problem (either bad scriptwriting or big chunks of the film left on the cutting-room floor - probably the latter, considering its short running time). I've got to blame the directors for the bad acting, where it exists. That kid who watches his dad die in the beginning of the film reacts like he's watching a guy getting a haircut. A lot of people are complaining about the violence and gore (and the propriety thereof), which are pretty extreme, but this is, after all, a horror film, and it aims to horrify, and definitely hits its target a few times. The difference here is that while the original ""Alien"" took the monster b-movie to the level of an A-list film, this one has decidedly gone full circle to the grindhouse. Whether that's a bad thing is entirely up to the viewer, of course. On The ""Predator"" side of the equation, ""AVP"" hasn't forgotten the action-movie roots of that film; one confrontation in the sewers is pretty well-done.An ongoing failure of logic pervades the film, as well as the apparent ignorance or disregard for series mythology. A fine example of both is in the already infamous maternity ward scene: What kind of animal has its reproductive system in its mouth...besides the Linda Lovelace character in ""Deep Throat"", that is? It also appears (I'll admit the scene flashes by in an instant, so I may well have misconstrued what I saw), that the alien young pop out of the woman's womb, which basic Biology 101 will tell you, ain't connected to the mouth. The Predator has an endless magical supply of glowing blue acid, which he has about a half-pint of, but which never runs out, despite the fact that at one point he uses enough of it to dissolve the entire contents of a swimming pool! The Predator's behavior is completely inconsistent in terms of both logic or motive (he vaporizes evidence, as if desperate to cover up Predator/Alien presence on Earth, yet leaves a guy, hanging and skinned, for no discernible reason). To top it off, most of the action scenes are incomprehensibly dark and jiggly, even by the standards of current cinema. Which is saying something. A couple of them work, including the aforementioned sewer business.There is a huge sort of WTF shrug at the near-end of the film, followed by a painful ""here comes the next sequel"" setup.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

That said, this isn't quite an instant sci-fi classic, but the Brothers Strause did do more justice to the franchise than Paul W.S. Anderson could ever hope to do. What the two directors did that Anderson failed to do in the original was put in REAL alien fighting predator action. And they made it rated R, not a wussy PG-13. That, and the setting of a small town in Colorado made it also have the FEEL of an alien/predator movie. There is one scene in particular that really nails the feeling of the original Alien movies. When you see it, you'll know. Finally, the ending, which I will not spoil, will probably be a real treat for AVP fans like myself. Overall, this was a good effort directing for the Brothers Strause.8/10...A classic it ain't but it captures the feel of the original movies and makes alien and predator respectable again.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

408,kinetsmac,The closest sensation to having a chest burster rip out of you,3,7 January 2008,"This movie is bad. I just want those four little words to set the groundwork of everything I have to write here. In fact, that quick phrase is so indicative of Aliens vs. Predator Requiem, that it bears being written a second time, with empashis:This movie is BAD.In fact, this film is so god-awful, gouge your eyes out, brain numbingly horrible that it actually damages the three far superior franchises it bears in its name (Aliens, Predator, and Aliens vs. Predator.) Where to begin with this car crash of a ""film"" is a tough question, but I figure the casting is as good a place as any.It would be an innacuracy to say there are no actors in this movie. It would NOT be an innacuracy to say that their talent is next to non-existent. Throughout the entire ordeal (excuse me, ""film"") the most poignant visual expression born by the cast is a look of blank apathy, one that says ""when the hell do I get my paycheck already?"" Even when either of the two titular monsters show up and attack, the expression of dull boredom remains transfixed to their Beverly Hills 90210 faces. The dialog drizzling out of said faces is equally dull and cliché'd into oblivion, with standards so low that it makes to first AVP look like The Godfather.I could go into detail about how abominable the writing is, but I think I just need to say one thing to get my point across: ""Writers Strike."" There, let's move on.Of course, as with any movie with ""vs."" in it's title (minus ""Kramer vs. Kramer) actual writing and acting is superfluous to action, which I'm sure many fans (myself included) were expecting at the bare minimum. Unfortunately, even at this, this vile piece of vomit falls flat on its drool ridden, mandible filled face. True, there is ONE good fight between the Predator and a bunch of Aliens in the sewers, for all the three minutes it takes up, and after that, it's right back to the crap. A few more sparsely placed, short fights occur later after that, but they're so poorly lit (a problem carried over from the first film,) and closely zoomed in that you might as well be watching two stray cats fighting over a mouse in a dark alley. For the directing Strauss bros. to claim to be ""special effects wizards,"" you would figure the fighting would be some action packed rock-em-sock-em special effects extravaganza, but no, instead were treated with a bunch of stupid looking suitimation ""fights"" that are always carefully (read: badly) shot so as to not reveal the wires and cables supporting the stiffly moving monsters. It's so obvious that the studio didn't have enough scratch to afford any good CG effects or fight choreographers, so instead the audience is forced to use its imagination. I actually wouldn't mind that so much if my freaking imagination weren't already blunted by the seemingly endless and horrible human scenes. In fact, I think my cerebral cortex might be irreparably damaged!On the upside (which, in the case of AVPR, is akin to finding the upside to Chernobyl incident) the film does have a bunch of homages to its source material, ones that may serve as points of mild relief for viewers sitting through this dreck. Sadly, that's about the only positive I can give to this movie, and let me add further that one of these ""homages,"" one involving the predator skinning a guy, actually goes against the plot of the film and screws everything up to the point of cinematic mental retardation.To those of you who loved the AVP comic and video game series, the future is looking very bleak. This piece of garbage has ""Franchise killer"" written all over it, with an ending that can only marginally serve as sequel material. My best advice to those who share the unpleasant experience of watching AVPR, break out those comics, video games, and even the first film, and let the nostalgia heal your wounds. To those who haven't seen the movie, I give the same advice I give to kids about drugs.JUST SAY NO.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
409,towt,Not the best movie I've ever seen,2,30 December 2007,"To be honest, this film was a bit of a let down. I went in with forgiveness in my heart. ""The last film was PG-13, that is why it wasn't very good. This one is R so it should be better"". Boy.. was I wrong. As previous comments have mentioned, you have a hard time connecting with any of the characters and the acting itself doesn't really stand out in any way. Not much chance of an Oscar for this particular film. Not a complete waste of money, I felt moderately entertained, but for a Alien and Predator fan, it was a bit of a letdown*****May contain spoilers after this point*****I guess my big beef with the film was the lack of AvP action. Sure humans get torn apart left and right, and the predator bags a few aliens and humans in his effort to clean up the mess, but honestly, it feels like a creature flick then an alien or a predator film.In addition, for true fans of both series, there are factual errors. I think for any movie, they need to either get the series' creators on board, or hire a few fanatics to make sure the film flows factually1) Predators nuke the place when they lose (See: Predator 1, 2)2) If I received a distress call, I wouldn't go alone. Especially against a new form of alien. I'd get a squad of predators just to be sure (See: Predator 2) 3) Predaliens are just drones, they can't reproduce (see: AVP games and books)4) The predalien achieved full size in under a minute, which isn't correct. It bursts out of a predator in the beginning, and then a minute later is killing stuff on the ship.What I think should be done is for the fans to sit down somewhere and collaborate on a script that will pay proper tribute to the series",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Until about a half hour into it i believed all of the reviews, until the battling began. From there on, it never really let up. The Predalien looks awesome, the aliens look very realistic, and the Predator kicked some serious ass. The movie definitely gets better as it goes along, and the finale is actually pretty cool, surprisingly enough. The acting really was not THAT bad for this type of movie, and there is one death that I bet no one saw coming. Don't go into it expecting too much and I'm sure you'll be entertained.

412,Sausage_Demon,"Better than AVP1, but that's not hard.",10,26 December 2007,"While this film may crap all over it's predecessor it is still of the Freddy VS Jason quality.The Effects were not too bad, which is good as they are riddled throughout the film. Although, as I say pretty much all the time about modern action scenes I wish they would stop shooting them so tight and cutting them so fast, it doesn't make it dramatic or pulse pounding it makes it confusing and annoying, and the main reason it is done is because nobody knows what the hell to do in the fight scene. Also, too dark, while I do like the atmosphere of the film it was too dark to see anything for the most part.The gore was really tame actually, there were a few gore gags, some blood packs going pop but really thats about it no where near what it was hyped to be, but I hope if they do an unrated DVD the much hyped up gore will be in there.The Human characters are really disappointing, no one to care about, too many of them to try to develop not that much attempt was made of course. Once you take out the human element and good characters you lose the film no matter how good everything else is.The writing was pretty dull, I suggest a different writer for AVP 3 should it be done.The film starts off well, but the pace never really escelates so it feels like it is standing still, and the characters really have no goal to achieve and no real obstacle to overcome (other than the get to the chopper without being eaten).But the film had a type of atmosphere which I think was what really saved it from being as bad as AVP1.While it lacked any horror as such, there were some very horrible things in this film, which really reminds me of the original Alien and how it was actually an evil sentient nightmare being and not just a big bug which thanks to Cameron's Starship Troopers rip off sequel they are now considered to be.All in all it was an OK flick, I expected much worse which is why I liked it more than I did the original AVP of which I expected more.

At first I was concerned the pacing was a bit too fast, as they quickly introduce the aliens to Earth, but then I realized no time was really necessary to introduce the stars (the Predator & aliens) and they can just move forward to setting up nicely choreographed and cinematic action sequences.I'll say the cinematography/visuals were terrific, adhering to the standards set with Predators 1&2 and Aliens 1&2.

414,phonenumberofthebeast,I had to see it. I really did. I only barely made it out alive,3,20 January 2008,"There are some movies, ""Highlander 2"" comes to mind, that are so bad you would seriously consider having your leg amputated in the wilderness without anesthetic before you would consider viewing them again. The mere act of watching becomes a trial, and one is genuinely afraid, not due to any efforts of the filmmakers, but for one's own life and sanity, pushed to the limits by the sheer awfulness of the production. The best thing I can say about AVPR, as we are now inanely forced to call it, is that it is not ""quite"" one of those movies. In some ways I wish it was; then at least it would be memorable.I knew going in it would be bad, and that it would probably be yet another nail in the coffin of my favorite scifi franchise (""Alien"" in my case, though I do enjoy the ""Predator"" films). I had seen the ""redband"" trailer, and stared in horror at its frenetic menagerie of 80s teen slasher clichés; I even watched the ""exclusive"" online clip of the film's first five minutes, and hoped that they had been edited down from a better-paced original (as it turned out, they had not). But even so, I gave the movie a shot. Why? I'm not sure. Perhaps because if a beloved artifice that one has admired for years is to be systematically dismantled and thrown on the trash heap, one should be there to watch it burn. At least, I thought, with my expectations this low, this movie's anonymous directors would have to try very hard to undercut them.They did. I mean really, they must have tried hard. It takes some kind of effort to take two of the most durable mythologies in modern scifi and make them a backdrop to a pizza guy's coming of age. Seriously. That is the only discernible story-arc in this entire film. Truth be told I could forgive even that if the characters hadn't came pre-assembled right out of the teen movie stock barrel. Instead this film spends 40 minutes trying to make us care whether Smarmy Teen gets it off with Hot Blonde before Blond Bully Ex-Boyfriend finds out. Thank God he has Troubled Ex-Con Brother (who trumps in along with his buddy, Nice Cop) to help him out once the aliens (who arrive courtesy of ""disturbing"" evisceration of Happy Hunting Dad and his son, Curious Preteen) start to take out the population (such as Mumbling Bum Who No One Will Ever Believe and Stupid Cop Who Keeps Looking In The Dark After Everyone Else Has Left). They soon meet up with Screaming Bereft Mother and Military Chick, who saves her daughter Cute Little Girl after her husband Wussy New Man is vivisected in line with tradition.Honestly, with this zoo of automated plot-bots to manage, how do the aliens and the predators (actually a Predator) get a look in? Well in truth, they don't. Very little time is spent developing either character (and let's face it, since neither character actually talks, that isn't surprising) and any tension built up between them is quickly dissipated as the film returns to the interminable ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" slasher plot.While many others on this page have done so, it's hard for me to criticize the flat pacing, the indiscernible closeup action sequences, the dark murky lighting and the nauseating jump-cuts, since these diseases appear to afflict every action film made today. Some have also argued this film destroyed its franchise(s). I disagree. Both franchises are strong enough and durable enough to survive even this. No, the cardinal sin committed by ""AVPR"" is that it is simply NOT SCARY. How could anyone forget that one vital component? Yes, it is gory, and yes, it has some elaborate death scenes, but none of them were particularly scary or even disturbing (the one scene that seems to have freaked everyone out, the ""pregnant mothers"" scene, was done better in the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake). When people remember the original ""Alien"", doubtless what comes to mind is John Hurt's iconic chestburster sequence. What people may forget is that that was the ONLY instance of in-your-face, on screen carnage in the entire movie. Every other (human) death either occurred offscreen, or barely on it. The horrors were left to our imaginations. Although many remember ""Aliens"" as a nonstop action thriller, it too was fairly restrained in its use of gore, and was all the more effective for it. It seems odd that two directors with such lessons in patience and economy as their inspiration chose instead to go for all out gratuity with no tension at all.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
415,twsegreto,Better then Paul Anderson's AvP,5,25 December 2007,"I am a big Alien and Predator fan. To all the fans - you will not be let down. The brothers did pretty well with what they were given. Personally my main problem with AvP and AvP-R is the fact that you can view what the Aliens and Predators are doing. Where as you did not get a glimpse of the Predator in the original until it was wounded.They did a fair job at giving the characters some background history, but I don't understand why they would give us 50% of the story (Between the two teenagers, ex-con, and the 'leading lady, who recently came back form the military). One second there is family problems and then all emotions disappear and Aliens and Predators are killing everything.The brothers went pretty big - there is much gore and almost taboo killings which was very unexpected.Overall, the trailer for AvP-R was better then the entire movie of AvP. If you watched AvP without wanting to kill yourself between the human-Predator love scenes then you will most most likely enjoy this film.It is difficult to review this film due to the fact that I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone and to give a decent review on this film it is a must.As a fan of Aliens and Predator since 2nd grade I left happy.

416,fivesaints,Much better than the first with a more realistic storyline and plot...,8,25 December 2007,"I first saw commercials to this movie and watching the first AVP, I did not have high expectations. Personally, the first AVP had cheap acting with a far-fetched storyline, whereas the AVP2 Requiem, left me thrilled and superbly satisfied leaving the theater. The reason I this movie attracted me other than the first was the storyline. Before the movie came out I new it would be about a smaller town with regular people and that intrigued me far more than a pyramid that happens to be 2000 feet under ice in Antarctica. Reasonably, if there was a pyramid that far below ice, how in the world did the ice not cover that pyramid? It just perfectly domed it so humans could walk right through. AVP2 started right where the first one ended with the half-predator/alien baby turning into a gruesome monster killing a predator, which caused another to shoot his beam at it, disabling the ship making it plummet toward a forest near a small city. The storyline kept me entertained with only a couple parts of the movie that were a little far fetched. For instance, in the movie, a small national guard battalion with an armored transport vehicle etc...let loose about thirty armed men. All the sudden a couple aliens kill every single one in about twenty seconds, and then some regular main character citizens find them, pick up their guns, and actually kill several aliens. The movie made the actual army seem stupid to contain any type of disturbance. Overall, the movie was a thrilling action-packed storyline with plenty of blood and gore to satisfy the average action movie goer. Predator RULES! 10/10",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
417,willis066,No way near great but way better than the first.,7,4 February 2008,first off this movie is not great it has terrible acting and it sucked how there was only 1 predator. BUT it blows the first one out of the water. first off were back to the original alien and predator franchises which were rated R what they did with AVP 1 making it PG-13 was crap the originals were bloody good fun and i felt i lost that fun in the first. second the Predator in this one is back to his kick a** state that he should have been in in the first film. i felt the predators were crap without there weapons in the first film while in AVP 2 this predator takes out tons of aliens no problem like it should have been. and also the predator in the first teaming up with the woman was terrible. in this one its back to a free for all humans Vs. Aliens Vs. Predators. so all in all this is not a great film but it is definitely better than the original. 7 out of 10 even a seven is a bit high for this film but i just enjoyed it way more than the first cmon people really... the first was way worse.,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
418,mentalmummy,Better than the first,7,31 January 2008,"This is better than the first movie, which was awful, but while taking its time to get interesting it's not bad at all and worth seeing for the Alien / Predator hybrid or if you don't like that there's always a brief scene with a hot chick in her underwear! The special effects are good as expected though the baby aliens still seem more like toys, the action is thick and fast and the movie is well worth a look.You won't be bored, you might not be overwhelmed but chances are if you're reading reviews of the film and you're a fan of aliens or predator you will enjoy this.The acting is not brilliant but it's not bad and while the script has some clichés it does a god job of keeping the story moving along so that you are never bored.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
419,sakis974,The worst movie...at the alien movie history!,2,5 February 2008,"I was so excited when I heard that finally this movie was coming to the theaters because I really liked the first AVP. But it was the worst movie ever of the alien and predator history, including the separate ones...it was so bad that 1 month ago on the internet released a fan movie called ""alien vs hunter"" I think something like that...it was a ""b"" movie...I can tell you this that I enjoyed more the fake ""b"" movie than the original AVPR. Its a shame that they destroyed a movie and the concept of it and I really hope the director of this movie also the lame writer to never get a real job ever in the movies industry...Im wondering if they are proud of the job they did?...because I feel disgraced of watching this crap...get a real job gentlemen..and leave the writing and directing to the professionals. It was so dark all the time you couldn't see anything..r it was supposed to imagine what was happening? The fight scenes?...I've seen so much better on TV series like Babylon 5 or something and the pred-alien? I still don't remember how it looked like. Honestly I really wish that the people who worked in this movie never get a job again because they just destroyed a LEGEND. Waste of money,waste of time.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
420,ifilmstuf24,I thought this would be better than the first movie. Boy was I Wrong.,1,15 July 2008,"This is got to be one of the Worst Movies I have ever seen! The Acting,The Dialogue,The Direction and even The Lighting (The Lighting Killed this already Dead Movie). You couldn't see what was going on throughout the movie because of it's awful lighting!What a shame this movie was! This movie couldn't get a decent script, actors, or directors! The First two ""Alien"" movies,(Alien & Aliens) are great Masterpieces of Science Fiction! The first ""Predator"" is an All-Out Fun Movie!Those two Franchises had the Talents of Big-named Stars such as, Sigourney Weaver,Arnold Schwarzenegger,Tom Skerrit,Ian Holm,Bill Paxton,Michael Biehn, Winona Ryder,Yaphett Koto,John Hurt,Danny Glover and the list goes on and on! Those two Franchises Had the Direction Talents of Ridley Scott, James Cameron,David Fincher, and John McTiernan of Die Hard fame.Why oh Why could they not get decent actors or filmmakers? I am not Criticizing the fact that there were some unknown actors, Some films with unknown actors have been very well acted,(See Cloverfield). But my question is why couldn't they get actors that can act? Well, I don't think I will ever get that answer!So my Final Verdict: 1* out of 10* 1/2 of a star out of 4This is my pick for the Worst Movie of 2007.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
421,judasfm,"No, no, NO!",4,6 June 2008,"I've been a die-hard fan of the Alien movies since I was nine, and one of my biggest regrets is not being old enough to see any of them (especially Aliens) at the cinema. With that in mind, I'll watch anything with an Alien in it and bought the DVD of this when I was out shopping.Big mistake. Let's break it down:THE GOODThe ending. No, I'm not just saying that because it meant the movie was over; the ending is pretty good in its own right. The CGI. I guess. I mean, it's done very well, but it's honestly no more impressive than seeing Bolaji Badejo dressed up in an Alien suit in the first movie. Fantastic CGI isn't enough to save a terrible script. The acting. Nothing spectacular, but it's good enough to pass.THE BADThe PredAlien. Although I was looking forward to seeing it...well, if you can imagine a PredAlien version of a Mary-Sue, you'll get pretty close. Not only does it come into being with fully pleated dreadlocks, it manages to annihilate half its own life cycle by doing away with the need for facehuggers, eggs and the queen alien. How? By kissing the intended victim and spitting the embryos down their throat, thus achieving in a few minutes what takes facehuggers at least an hour, based on the other movies. Yes, embryos plural. Instead of the single chestburster munching its way out of some poor victim's torso, there's now a litter of three or four to a person (which, interestingly enough, look absolutely nothing like the PredAlien that fathered them). The action...or lack thereof. Okay, so I'm the first to admit that a movie doesn't have to have constant shooting in it to be fantastic (the original Alien movie is a case in point here) but you need something to keep the audience occupied. When the people did start shooting I remember sitting up and thinking, Wow, something's FINALLY happening! Three minutes later I was back in a kind of idle boredom. The characters. The other Alien movies (and to a lesser extent, the first AvP) gave you characters you could care about and relate to, characters you really wanted to survive. This one...well, if you can tell each of the main characters apart at the end of the movie (much less remember their names) you're doing well. No exaggeration.For (really) die-hard Alien/Predator fans, it's worth a look purely because it has Aliens/Predators in it, but there's not much more to recommend it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
422,mike-1716,A Good Homage,7,21 January 2008,"The problem with any kind of AVP movie is that it has to live up to the seminal influence of the original Alien/Aliens/Predator movies which - without any question of doubt - are sci-fi classics.AVPR, more than anything else, is purely and simply an homage to the movies that came before. The sound effects, score, scenes and at least one character name are a mash-up of those from the other movies in the franchise. This is done quite honestly, however. Right from the opening moment, for example, the score blends together the styles of all its forebears in a seamless run. You don't need any bigger clue than that to know that you are about to see an homage flick.And I have to say that it works remarkably well in this context. The creature designs are excellent (certainly much better than the abominations in A3 & A4); there is plenty of fighting; the plot lines are really not bad and the acting is perfectly adequate. Whilst A1 & A2 spend a long time on human character development, AVPR *mostly* cracks on with the action. Which is absolutely fine if you like that kind of thing.Most of the ""plot holes"" reported on this site are easily discounted. For example, in response to the ill-considered diatribe of ""Arnold_is_Numero_Uno"", point by point:1. A race as advanced as the Predators *might* check for face-hugger impregnation as a matter of course or they *might* actually have an alien mindset that doesn't worry too much about danger.2. There is no evidence whatsoever that the Predalien becomes fully grown in 10 seconds. The ship was obviously *in orbit* around the Earth for some time.3. Predators are violent creatures who don't put safety first. It is more than likely that they would fire guns in their own ship.4. You cannot assert under what circumstances a Predator might or might not wear his mask. If he wears it in the ship, so what? 5. The journey to the crash site would be mind-numbingly tedious if every step taken were shown. That's why it wasn't shown that way.6. There are many reasons why a Predator *might* send out a distress beacon to his home world.7. The Predator wrist bomb could easily be set to have variable yields.8. A skinned human is not evidence of an alien attack.9. The Predalien does not have to act in accordance with ""established"" behaviour in comics.10. Military commanders, like many people, are susceptible to corruption.11. Field reports of the aliens' spread was obviously being fed back to the military.12. The script is for the most part perfectly fine.Regardless, whether there are a few plot holes or not, it's a sci-fi movie predicated on a rather unlikely vision of the future, so if you are worried by such matters the problem is probably in your head, not the movie.Where would I pick fault? The Predators look more like men in suits than in the other movies and some of the thermal CGI of aliens running around in the distance is not too convincing. But there are many effects that more than make up for these oversights. For example, an alien bursting out of a sewer into the street perfectly captures the raw, alien aggression of these creatures - on a par with the frantic violent flaying of the aliens in the A2 air-ducts.In summary, AVPR is a well-made tribute to the other Alien/Predator movies.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

So hard to put everything....might as well write the story instead but i wont. :P Some people like this kind of film but i find that out of one alienpred there comes hundreds of aliens in a couple of days? do bacteria grow that quick? :0 The predator too....why only one? Its like sending in one soldier versus hundred of soldiers? :o confused :f So heres my last point .... in a short summary its a great film for me but others would disagree with me and i respect that but in my OPINION i think its a quick, action packed film! :D Thanks for reading people! Happy Reviewing and i think it is a reasonable seven out of ten. :)",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
424,MonkeyVooDoo,What has the movie industry come to?,3,19 March 2008,"This movie is where it hit rock bottom for me... I don't know what to say other than I was appalled when I walked out of the theatre after seeing this. When a movie that could have focused on aliens fighting predators instead focuses on aliens fighting humans and a predator covering everything up, I guess thats when everything has gone to hell. When the majority of your characters were brought in for the sole purpose of being killed off, you have a movie which collapses in on itself after the fifteenth or so killing. This was a movie which was solely trying to market itself as a ""hack and slash"" gore fest, when you could have had a story focusing on a single character, maybe two, hell maybe even three, trying to find a way to defeat the aliens other than using firearms, and trying to escape from the non-existent 15 story building in Gunnison, CO. This move gets a pitiful 3 out of 10 stars, for a pitiful attempt at trying to get me to enjoy such a farce of a film.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
425,littlejimmy835,"The fact this movie was a theatrical release astonishes me, as it is deserving of the direct to DVD category.",2,27 December 2007,"Starting where the last AVP left off, an Alien ""chestburster"" emerges from a dead Predator on a Predator spaceship, and causes the Predator space ship to crash into modern day Gunnison Colorado, where it breeds several more Aliens which start to cause havoc. The Predator race sends down a lone highly experienced and armed Predator to ""clean up the mess"". Our human characters are caught in the middle of the intergalactic battle.The biggest problem with this movie is the pacing. This movie moves along way too fast. The opening credits have only just rolled and already the Predator ship crashes into the Earth after the Alien grows to full hight, a hunter and son character are introduced but before we even get to learn their names they are both killed, then we see the Predator home-world and the lead Predator flies off to fight the Alien infestation, and all this happens within the first five minutes. This unnatural pace does not let up for the entire movie; the National Guard comes into town but within two minutes are all killed without even getting a good look at a single ones face, the manager of a pizza store gets one scene of character development only to be killed off the very next time we see him once again without even learning his name, random hobos, a coffee shop waitress and chef are killed again without learning their names. One moment our main characters are at home, the next running around town, the next in a gun store , the next in an APC, and this random set jumping over and over just doesn't ever let up leaving the audience no time to settle in leaving them grasping for straws.Another problem is the settings and time frame. The movie is set in modern day Gunnison Colorado. Every other Alien and Predator movie was shot in enthralling settings, such as industrial space ships, guerrilla war zone rainforest's, alien planets, and underground labyrinths. Now comes along AVP-R, set in a small modern day American town, with set ""highlights"" including a sporting goods store, parking lots, Pizza Shops, and little girl's bedrooms. I mean, were they actually trying to make the movie look as dull, drab and uninteresting as possible?! It's hard to perceive these monsters as frightening creatures when they are standing next to a shelf full of Reeboks, or hiding in the bushes outside little girls bedrooms.Continuity is a big issue with this film. The Alien series was set in the future, no human had even heard of an Alien before the first film, and the Aliens not only had never been to Earth, but if they ever did reach Earth, humanity would be destroyed. This movie ruins that entire concept by being set in modern day, with Average Joes seeing the Aliens all over the place, and by the end of the movie, humanity is not destroyed, not even suffering what could be considered minor losses. It pisses all over that entire concept of the other movies. Attempts to maintain continuity are made with massive Deus Ex Machina's. The Predator just happens to carry around a bottle of unlimited magic blue liquid that's just to melt away any bodies with just a single drop, the army at the end of the movie just happens to go to overly drastic measures and drop a nuclear warhead that just conveniently erases all evidence of the Aliens existence despite the fact there were many survivors of the incident who are witnesses, and many more bad attempts are made at filling up impossible to cover plot holes.Also, for a ""Verses"" movie, it has unrelenting bias in favor of the Predators. For the majority of the film, a lone Predator manages to kill dozens if not tens of dozens of Aliens, all at mêlée range while barely gaining a single scratch, while the Aliens just get slaughtered left right and center like clay pigeons, merely waiting their turn to be killed by the Predator without putting forth any effort to defend their selves. This movie should not be called ""Alien vs. Predator"", as much as it should be ""Predator massacres Aliens"". I mean, how can you have two species battle it out with suspense and tension, when one is portrayed as being vastly superior to the other? The characters in this film are amongst the biggest flaws. Not only do they pale in comparison to the characters from the previous Alien and Predator movies, but even as a stand alone movie they are bland, dreary, and even at times cringe worthy. The characters in this movie consist of I kid you not, horny couples wanting to get laid, pizza delivery boys, blonde bimbos, high school bullies, children, and a blatant copy and paste job ripping off Ripley and Newt; the worst and most cliché possible ideas for characters. Not only that, but all of the aforementioned characters are acted by teenagers. While the casting of teenagers is an obvious attempt to pull in younger audiences, its only effect is to make the movie look and feel like a typical teenybopper slasher-porn movie, with actors who are too young to have learned how to give a convincing performance, with them mostly having completely blank facial expressions delivering monotone dialog. Not only this, but these characters do some of the most cinematically retarded things ever, such as using Predator guns, commenting the powers out when it has been for hours, following dumb plans to get out of town rather than just walking out of town somewhat quickly, and just so many other idiocies that the movie actually had the audience in my theater sighing out of frustration.In the end this movie is just a horrible B movie, something deserving of the direct to DVD category. The fact this movie was a theatrical release astonishes me, as every part of the movie just ranks of amateur work.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
426,starfoxfan86,one of the worst I've seen in a while,1,17 December 2013,"honestly, there's only two things that make this movie so bad first of all, this movie seems to like to focus on the human characters that we don't care about more and somehow also gives us more of the aliens and predators second, I'm guessing that 85% of this movie is filmed in the dark with little to know light. so essentially, you can hardly see what's even happening if there's anything good to say- 1:at least this movie has mostly practical creature effects. 2: this movie does have some gore, but it's nothing noticeable. anything else isn't important enough to note here.in the end, this is a really bad movie, but I wasn't disappointed. I heard this was worse than the first one and I got what I expected.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
427,wikkit27,Disgrace to Arnold,2,3 January 2008,"This movie had no originality or thought to it, other than the obvious being that it's a sequel. Seriously, if I'm just a movie-goer who can pull out these flaws, who do producers pay to write these stories and proof them? Too many concepts/lines from the original Predator were stolen for this new failure of a movie. One being the predator walking over a catwalk of a power plant while the alien is hiding underneath, (a deliberate play on the scene when ""Dutch"" hides from the Predator underneath the fallen tree trunk bridge in the original Predator) and the most despicable part of the movie is finalizing the plot as ""trying to make it to the chopper so that they can escape"". Even the semi-lead character shouts ""Get to the Chopper"" as he is left behind to ward off the aliens. I am a fan of the original Predator, but any predator vs. alien movie will never do very well unless you take the human element out of the story. The only solid performance in this movie was from a different species that doesn't even talk. And the predator's actions contradict each other. What happened to the concept that the Predator was a hunter and wouldn't kill people who are no major threat? Even the Predator in Predator 2 wouldn't kill a boy with a gun, because it knew he was no threat. The newest of the Predators is killing humans left and right, humans who would bring no honor in killing. I guess all that honorable-hunter instinct goes out the window when the Alien/Predator half breed goes into the maternity ward of the hospital and impregnates already pregnant women turning them into alien water balloons, having their guts splashed all over. I especially hated the end when it said, ""a movie by the brothers Strause"" as if they are some great dynamic story-telling duo. Like ""The Brothers Grimm"" They should have left Arnold to his masterpiece bellow, ""Run! Get to the Choppa!"". Stealing this phrase is a line that should never be crossed. The Brothers Strause should stick to making their Nickelback videos. I wouldn't be proud to stamp my namesake on that movie as if it would be some great success. Now every time I see ""The Strause Brothers"" on any movie I'll expect to see something so grotesque as having the beauty and sanctity of a pregnant woman giving birth degraded to shameless violence without any regard to taste and class. The Strause brothers are horrible, next to the Cravens. I give this movie a 2. One for having a Predator in the movie, and 1 for having an Alien in the movie. I honestly think they put ""Requiem"" in the title because it sounds cool. Do ""The Strause Brothers"" even know what Requiem means??",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
428,puzzow,"Yes, it's a sucky film- but was anyone really expecting otherwise?",4,24 June 2008,"The original ""Alien"" and it's sequel are two of the finest action/sci-fi/thrillers ever made. The original ""Predator"" is, to a lesser extent, a well-made 80's era action/thriller. The current round of Alien vs. Predator films are nothing but concept- a product derived from video games and comic books churned out to attract a young, male demographic. It is shame that they've bastardized two great film franchises to do it- you can't help but draw comparisons and, in doing so, yearn for the original movies, which were genuine films and not slickly packaged marketing material. On an even sadder note, this sequel suffers in comparison to the first Alien versus Predator, which itself was far from a magnum opus. The current movie takes the most generic ""creatures attacking a small town"" plot line, touches upon every horror cliché in the book and has absolutely nothing new to offer in the process. The only thing that differentiates it from a Saturday afternoon Sci-Fi channel ""creature-feature"" are the very expensive-looking special effects. In fact, this movie seems to mainly exist for its special effects. If you check the credits, you will see that two directors of this film primarily have special effects work to their name- which they probably stick to doing because, as this film demonstrates, special effects do not a movie make.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

I could hack at the film but i really didn't expect any more than what i thought it would be. Plot holes everywhere, confusion about the actual plot, no acting, an 'maybe-maybe not' ending, and that irrepressible non-stop gore and profanity with no sense of realism to make it anything more than a mindless blood fest that leaves you dry and unreeled. Although much better than it's predecessor, it again fails to leave any remnants of the original's genius quality excepting the characters themselves. And still with this film you find yourself looking at the Aliens and Predator, and finding not a shred of depth that they portray in the other films. The characters could once hold you in their slimy palms, but now they have been overtaken by the eye candy and the special effects. Yet even visually, it fails to succeed the originals even with the updated technology. There's no originality in the script and delivery, yet strangely no sentimentality or nostalgia either. For that, the half hour of predictability and blood on the screens comes just over AVP and way under Alien: Resurrection, a similar gory approach with a much better delivery and much more of that nostalgic sentimentality. Ellen Ripley, we miss you. As for the audience, see 'Sunshine' or the original Alien and Predators instead. The DVD's are worth more than this dry 'horror'",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

AVPR picks up right where the first film left off, and from beginning to end it is non-stop Predator Vs. Alien action. You find yourself thinking you will be watching a predictable ""Horror"" film and find yourself a surprisingly satisfying, actually scary at points, thing of beauty.Clocking in at almost 90 minutes it hardly seems that short. With actors that have not done anything huge before, but still deliver, and fight scenes between our two favorite extraterrestrials this film has every right to be called a Blockbuster.For Vetrans of the Aliens series, you will notice a few actors and other things, that were previously featured in the various films. Though it does have a rather simple plot, you hardly notice underneath all of the cage match action between two of the most terrifying monsters in film history. And the ending gives sweet promises of a sequel.Bottom Line- See this movie, if you don't you are going to feel very left out on what everyone will be talking about the next day.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

437,teldrassil99,This could even make a Predalien cry,2,27 December 2007,"I was amazed twice tonight. The first was seeing how absolutely dreadful this movie was. The second was seeing that the rating for this film is hovering above the 7 mark! It all started out so well. The opening scene continues on from where the first AVP finished -- with the birth of a Predalien. But it all goes downhill rapidly from there. Nonsensical plot lines, tedious cardboard-cutout characters, blatant stupidity by both human and alien protagonists... the list goes on.Some of the ""positive"" reviews comment on how AVPR is superior to AVP, but it was hard to see any improvements whatsoever. If anything, the plot, and what could laughably be called attempts at acting, are considerably worse. And while AVP tried to do a few original things, this one ripped off so many things form ""Aliens"" (including the sound of the motion-trackers, a device that make no appearance in this film!) that what others have generously called a ""homage"" should really be called ""plagiarism"".It seems that the Strause brothers made their name by being special effects wizards -- good on them. To be honest, the effects in this film were actually quite decent. Too bad that everything else about the film was not. Why on earth did anyone think that being able to do effects qualifies them to direct a movie? Out of all Alien and Predator movies to date, this is by far the worst.

438,spirit_pulse,The writers listened to the fans,8,22 January 2008,"Look people, if you're expecting epic plot lines and Oscar winning performances matched by dialogue, don't go see a film titled Aliens versus Predator. Go see Mr Darcy and all the other pretentious, dialogue heavy performances that middle England has to offer and stop complaining. All these people who go watch this film and complain about these things, obviously didn't read the title (end rant). Anyway for those interested in seeing these two characters slugging it out on screen, will pleased to see that this film makes up for the first movie. Check list should read- Aliens versus Predator: Tick. (distinct lack of this in the first film) Predators weapons arsenal explored: Tick. Taking the best bits from Predator and Aliens films: Tick. Dumb, shallow, expendable, ""human"" characters that nobody really cares about: Tick. Lots of decent CGI, effects and rubber suits: Tick. Easy to follow plot, only serving to help Alien meet Predator for fist fights: Tick. Hollywood style ending that rounds the ultra thin plot line up: Tick. Lots of blood, violence, gore and guts: Tick.There you go folks. It has all the action of Aliens' chaotic shooting and fighting, mixed with the Predators exceptional style of hunting. And while its not as claustrophobic as Aliens or Homo erotic as Predator it still delivers what we all expect. It even pays homage to the originals by borrowing some dialogue, which fans of these films will spot. Don't expect big things from this, but the writers have listened to the fans gripes from the first movie. They actually put Aliens against Predators and gave me what I was expecting from the first film. Leave your brain at the door and enjoy the viewing.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
439,rmilljunk,Insulting at best...,3,6 January 2008,"AVPR! Aliens Vs. Predator, sounds like a fun time at the movies right? Wrong.I am a fan of the Alien and Predator movies (perhaps not the ""biggest"" fan but a fan nonetheless). I saw the first AVP movie and was mildly entertained. It definitely wasn't fantastic or really anything special but it was good fun the first couple times watching it. Then I saw posters for Aliens vs. Predator Requiem and I heard rumors that they were going to go for a darker, more intense, and somewhat original sequel.To name a few complaints: the movie was too dark and it was near impossible to focus on any of the details, the dialog was awful...flat and boring at best with constant lines including ""We need guns!"" and ""This plan is stupid!"". I knew nothing about the characters nor did I care what the heck happened to them. I was confused throughout the entire movie who they actually wanted the main character to be, and by the time we got to the end I still didn't know who the main character was. There wasn't a sex scene but there was a sexual scene and it seemed so ""thrown"" into the movie I felt it was irrelevant, unimportant, and an insult to my intelligence. The violence was expected but the gory gross-out scenes crossed the line WAY too many times! (Pregnant ladies, babies, and young boys come to mind) There just wasn't enough action between the aliens and predator himself...which is obviously what I expected to see.By the time the credits were rolling I was the thinking to myself: this wasn't Alien vs. Predator...this was a cheap-teen-horror-slasher-flick, a genre that has been used way to much in the last ten years. I felt the people involved in this movie could have made a much more entertaining movie, had they put more effort and thought into it.Simply put, this movie is a sequel to a movie that is based off of two franchises that have all but reached the end as it is. It's bad, not sort of good, not slightly entertaining, just bad...",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

It is much different than the first in that there is a lot more action and blood. As good as it is it does have flaws. Lets just say I don't think the acting is going to be nominated for a golden globe, but thats a small complaint when you consider the rest of the movie. The only other problen is some of the lighting, sometimes you cant see well, but again that is a small complaint. Now if you have'nt predator or alien, you might not understand some of the things that the predator or the alien do. Another new thing is the predalien, he prettymuch is sweet but not as sweet as the predator.

Same applies with Predator very good movies 1st one ultimate, 2nd pretty cool.What SHOULD happen when ya combine these movies, 6 movies which have been the best Alien/Terror war-crisis crazy action movies for a long time,also they all had a runtime of approx 2-3hours (if they're the uncut versions) everything needed to make a good movie, so they completely screwed it up with AvP first episode, bad actors, typical B-movie storyline everything just happens, totally predictable and the ""key figures"" just happens to know everything that's happened, happening and going to happen, of course they also have to do a childish copycat version of the other Alien movies having a Female as the hero, of course no problem with that. but when they do the same crap in AvP2 laughing out loud.OK AvP2, i guess it had decent special effects but that's prob all it has, it's way to short to be stamped with Alien AND predator in the title also a typical B-movie concept.So what they do with those 1 hours 20 minutes, they add DRAMA into it, WHAT THE HECK ?? we dun want any god damn Drama of some high-school kids kicking each-others butts, and it's going on for almost the first hour in these 80 minutes.then BOOM!! everything happens in 1 HALF god damn night, the Aliens are spreading like a nuclear bomb, they rape women at hospitals giving birth and they grow up to full size in a few minutes, and the Big nasty Predalien he's moving to different places in the city in nanoseconds almost that you start to believe he's got some kind of Scotty porter device.then what? we got the crisis situation where all the military guys who're suppose to help solving things out the ""Female"" who just happened to be some hardboiled military chick takes control of the action, oh and she got her little kid with her who just happens to be a little sweet girl (newt? ringing any bells?), she drives thru town with an APC (armored personal carrier) and she's also looking back at the people inside that vehicle saying ""HANG ON!!"" then she drives like crazy with the same music from Aliens (2nd alien movie) and everything from there on is more like a comedy with predictable jokes and not very fun ones either.1st AvP was OK! not much more then that, it was just a cool thing to see predators and aliens have a Tag tournament, AvP2 was just a bad ripoff of Aliens (2) seriously how can they even let this crap happen to such good series of movies? :( i'm giving this movie a 3 out of 10, only because it's far much better/Cooler then 95% of every other crap movie the multi billionaire companies spit out every day now-day, and it's a ""cool subject"" it's built on.rest well watch it and cry for yourselves..",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
442,c_degner,"I didn't watch this movie for plot,,,,",9,26 December 2007,",,,I came to see Aliens and Predators trying to kick each other's ass!! The human characters may have been 2 dimensional, but who really cares? After all, the title is 'Aliens vs Predator,' not 'Gunnerson, CO, A Love Story.' From reading previous posts, you all know the story and how it goes. The first movie was about the Predator's hunting the Aliens as a right of passage, earning the right to wear shoulder cannons. The addition of the Weyland Corp. discovering the temple in the Antarctic was a good story arc.This time around, there's the Alien/ Predator hybrid to tangle with from the first movie. Before there is any argument over whether or not the alien takes on the characteristics of its host, I'll remind you that the alien did in the 3rd movie - it burst out of a dog, if I recall correctly, and ran after Ripley and the prisoners on all fours, like it's host would. (My inner nerd/ geek coming out, here) Another poster mentioned the showing of the hybrid in the nursery to imply it ate the human babies before shoving little baby aliens down the throats of pregnant women, as being ""too over the top."" I don't recall the aliens having a soul or regard for human or other life; just being the perfect killing machines that they are. Engineered and bred to kill and they do in spades in this film.I did root for the Predator, and always will, because unlike the aliens, they do have a code. In Predator 2, he was about to kill a woman cop until he discovered she was pregnant. He let her live unlike the aliens in this movie as I mentioned above. Here, we see that he's portrayed much like Harvey Keitel's character of ""The Cleaner"" in 'Point of No Return' (remember when he dissolved the targets in the fountain using acid?) or 'Pulp Fiction.' He doesn't care how the mess got created, he's just there to clean it up as best he can and leave no traces. Like my Drill Instructor always said - ""We were never here.""Why I gave it a '9' out of 10? First was the lighting - too dark; what's wrong with using dimmer light? Have it take place at dusk or dawn, or something? Another was because this Predator was bad ass from the get go; taking on 5 aliens at once isn't an easy feat, but from the sight of his trophy room it's clear he's accomplished and more than capable of handling his task. However, I was let down by him taking one of his shoulder cannons and turning it into a pistol. That cheapened his image for me, because I felt the Predator to be like a ninja type hunter and not have to resort to something that crude. I suppose as maybe a last resort, but still it didn't sit right with me.The ending I felt was rushed, but it had the same feel as the 'Resident Evil' franchise; giving it a mediocre ending to leave wide enough room for a sequel.IMO, the human characters just got in the way. Perhaps a better installment to appease everyone would be to leave out the human characters, and have us watch a movie with zero dialog set on a desolate planet in the far reaches of space where we can see both species' behavior in action.Then again, people would bitch about that, too.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
443,grimdugald,AVP - Well worth seeing. AVPR (THIS) - HELL NO!,1,4 April 2011,"Let me start by saying, given the set up the ending of AVP had, just how unbelieeeevably annoying the disaster that is this movie truly is. Maybe I should just leave it at that - review over lol. But let me (aside from simply stating this movie is terribly made) tell you my main reasons for my point of view on this matter....1st: This movie isn't even entertaining accidentally. 2nd: They took a great ending from AVP and tossed it. 3rd: (NOW THIS IS A REEEAL STINKER)...It is filmed appallingly!!!!! When I say this my main point is that in this movie, AVPR, THERE ARE MORE SHOTS OF ""QUITE OBVIOUSLY A GUY IN AN ALIEN SUIT"" THAN IN EVERY ALIEN RELATED MOVIE COMBINED TOGETHER...WITH ROOM TO SPARE! Sorry for all the capitals folks but this annoys the hell out of me no end, personally!What ""The Brothers Strauss"" have done, ladies and gentleman, is take the loving devotion and dedicated bloody hard graft of two of the movie industry's finest talents: Alec Gillis & Tom Woodruff Jr. and pee all over it. There are so many movies that simply would not be the glorious spectacle they are, without these guys. And it really grieves me to see this has happened. They deserve more respect.Basically in an attempt to not let the fire die down too much (and thus lose revenue) the studio bods gave the making of this movie to people they never should have. It would have been better if a sequel to AVP had never been made and what happened next was just left to the imagination; like with the ending of John Carpenter's The Thing for example. No doubt, AVP left you absolutely itching for a sequel...a skill PWSA has in abundance. But I would rather have not had a sequel knowing this tripe would be the result. I'm giving this a rating of one (and we'll say that's only for all the bloody hard work Alec & Tom no doubt put in. Plus Brian Tyler, who's a great composer). The directors & producers get ZERO from me. Zip. Zilch. 0. Nothing! Sort out your tax forms instead of watching this, you will get a greater sense of satisfaction ;)",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Perhaps you should stick with the visual effects next time (considering the films you worked on you do that very well).I found it hard to keep up with who is who during the movie. Maybe that says something about the acting, maybe it says something about me as a viewer.

445,whostolemysocks,A prime example of why Mystery Science Theater 3000 should return to television.,1,29 December 2007,"I can't rant enough about how bad this movie was. The actors were terrible, the movie was basically without a plot or a story, and there were so many clichés it wasn't even funny. As i wanted to smash my face into a wall after seeing this, there was only one good thing about this. Predator was still a crazy badass as always. But let's start with the bad. 1: The acting. Is there anyone worse than Steven Pasquale? I mean, God, his name is Dallas in the movie, his one liners are corny as hell, and he's just a plain loser. Then there's Johnny Lewis AKA Ricky, who is a Paul Walker wannabe. And that's saying something. When Paul Walker would make this movie better, you know you're watching a bad movie. 2: The story or lack thereof. Here's a summary: predalien is born, predator ship crashes into hicktown USA, predators all die, people die, people die, people die, meet loser Dallas and cop, people die, people die, people die, meet main Predator, meet loser Ricky, Ricky gets his ass kicked, people die, people die, people die, meet Army chick, main Predator comes to earth, people die, people die, people die, predator and aliens fight, people die, people die, people die, loser Ricky makes out with hot girl, people die, people die, people die, another pointless conversation between loser Dallas and cop, people die, people die, people die, people decide to group together and die, people die, people die, people die, predator and aliens fight, people die, people die, people die, army drops nuclear bomb on city killing everyone and aliens and predator, loser Dallas and Ricky and army chick all survive, the end. 3: The plot holes. There is so much that is not explained in this movie. 4: The horror movie clichés. A lot of stuff is used and reused by this movie that already has been used in other horror movies, such as: ""Oh there's no monsters outside, dear"" (shines light outside and monster jumps in and kills him). Also, someone tries to climb out a window and gets pulled back in by an alien, and then blood sprays on the window. There are many more also. In the end, it's plain and simple: if you are a fan of the alien and the predator series, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! you will be sorely disappointed. These kind of movies make me wonder why they got rid of Mystery Science Theater 3000.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
446,indigol,Filmed too dark and what one can see isn't that impressive! Wasted potential !,2,3 October 2008,"Threw out the original alien life-cycle and continued to add to the quick spawning concept was the least of the problems with AVP:R.There was much potential for this film as it brought back that Aliens feel - humans vs. aliens. If the lighting wasn't too dark to see if anything was happening then the sound editing left much to be desired. Most of the film felt like one was listening to a bad radio show then something one would attempt to see upon a screen.About 1/3 of this film was good but the rest was a waste of this viewer's time. Imagine cranking out this kind of crap because of brand name instead of a clear and well done picture. Yes it's got a handful of Aliens and some Predators but it's not completely true to the original films that spawned this franchise.The PredAlien was interesting but once again making something a ""queen"" isn't what a story about the Alien or Predator should be about. There was more opportunity with the Predator ship's face huggers then making the PredAlien a queen for the sheer purpose of accelerating the poorly conceived AVP:R storyline.The one of the worst parts of the film was the new direction ending that seemly defeat the continuity regarding the mysterious 'Company' behind the first and second Alien films. If the Company HAD Predator technology then why did they not have that technology in the hands of the Marines or other groups at the time of first and second Alien movies. Seems that AVP and AVP:R are attempting to create their own failed universe by stepping upon as much as the previous Predator or Alien films concepts or legacy.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
447,salted11,An improvement on a franchise that shamelessly capitalizes on superior individual titles...,6,9 January 2008,"As a kid, I was a fan of comics and the appeal of Aliens vs. Predator in print seemed a no-brainer for purchase. It brought two of my favourite screen franchises in a head-on collision that thrilled me through every episode. Several years later, Aliens vs. Predator is brought to the silver screen. My curiosity peaked, I sit dumbstruck through the first installment as some craptastic back story involving pyramids and Predator enslavement of the Incans or some crap unfolds. Who the hell thought that was a necessary addition? Two space aliens both with complete backstories fight because they're badass, why complicate matters with new ideas from left field? Anyway, what the first AvP movie was missing was AvP. Now, several years later, the franchise is revived and the R-rated trailer definitely brought me back to the theatre. Someone was paying attention. The movie starts with a lone Predator heading out to take care of the mess brought on by a crashed Predator ship. The only reference to the first movie is the introduction of the Pred-alien, bringing forward an idea first seen in Alien3 when the Alien is incubated in a host other than a human takes on the traits of the new host. So all that's left is the Aliens kicking the crap out of some humans with a big, bad-ass Predator following up. And make no mistake, the Predator is in town for business. A lot of the familiar cues and visuals Predator fans are familiar with will be seen and heard (the jungle music as he draws near, the flashing eyes when invisible, the triple-laser sights), and the Aliens are most often played by real men in costumes, creating a more realistic visual experience. So now that we have the main title characters, what about the backdrop? What about the humans? Director: ""Hey screenwriter, what are we going to do about these humans in the film?"" Writer: ""Hold on, I'm almost finished watching my Planet Horror, Red Dawn, every movie where a bunch of yokels hole up in a gun store and try to take their destinies into their own hands."" Director: ""Ah, got it, sounds good."" Nothing new there. Anyway, its nothing surprising on that front. There won't be any Oscars, but there's a lot of creative death and destruction. What I wanted the first time around I got more of the second time. Let's hope the third time has Space Marines.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

If the acting were  merely serviceable, I could have enjoyed the film to some extent.  Unfortunately, the acting in the film is so terrible you have a hard  time even looking at the screen without wincing....it's almost as if  they took people off the street who had never even read the script (as  moronic it may be.) To take a quote from Futurama ""I have seen better  acting from extras in Godzilla movies!"" and that is a perfectly fitting  description for this movie. The acting is so terrible it feels as  though the entire film is going to collapse on itself but, alas, the  torture lasts 86 minutes. If that weren't enough, the story is about as  inventive as a 3rd rate Sci-Fi channel movie and the films much praised  gore factor is surprisingly low (FAR less than the far superior Alien  Resurrection.) The directing is horrific, the situations end up  spoofing themselves unintentionally. The only positive aspect about the  film are a few of the predator scenes and the final fight scene between  the Predator and the Predalien, which is intense but fleeting. I feel  like I have just been raped. I hated the first AVP and, although the  creatures in this film look better and the violence is better, the  acting and directing was far superior in that film....and that's not  saying a lot.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

There is a ton of gore (Which I love) and I honestly found it a bit better fight wise then the original AVP movie. Acting is atrocious, but again, as I said, you want the best experience, skip the human side. The Predalien was pretty cool, and by god, the Predator. The Predator alone, was the best aspect of this movie. It's a popcorn flick to pass the time, and it isn't too long either. In a way, AVPR is sort of a guilty pleasure.

451,Forever_21,Precious material done justice,8,31 January 2008,"Let's get one thing answered first: yes, I am a huge fan of the Aliens and Predator movies and spin off books including the original Aliens vs Predator books. I have mixed fillings about all of the previous films in the series: the first Predator and Alien films are still masterpieces of the genre; Aliens is still one of my favourite films; Alien 3 is disappointing; as is Predator 2; Resurrection is laughable; and most importantly Alien vs Predator (the first outing for these two monster-ka-ching-fanchises) was dire and a wasted opportunity considering the material Paul W.S. Anderson had at his disposal with the books and comics. It's important that I relay my feelings  albeit briefly  about these films because I need it understood that my eye was far more critical and biased than the casual viewer whilst watching this latest outing.The film starts just as the first AVP film left off: an impregnated Predator back aboard his ship with the rest of his pack just as a new hybrid chest-burster rips its way free of his body. Thus begins an introduction that culminates in the Alien returning to earth and the beginnings of an infestation in a small town in Colorado. From then on what ensues is a no-holds-barred survival horror that never quite leaves you breathless but nevertheless keeps the heart racing. The only hope in stopping this infestation is a lone Predator who seems hell bent on tracking down the new hybrid and claiming its skull (imagine the kudos back home!).This isn't top-draw film-making and it isn't Oscar-worthy acting but it is damn good fun. Each character is established nicely and even in the wake of an impending disaster you do begin to bond with some of the main characters, not deeply, but enough to care when they finally come face to face with some brilliantly timed deaths, and the death comes thick and fast. There is also some unprecedented screen killing, even bordering on controversial, but each death just exemplifies the determination and remorselessness of the Alien and indeed their relentless invasion that proves that Ripley was right: if just one of these things reaches a populous, you can kiss everything goodbye.Having said all of that, this film is far from perfect. Kelly O'Brien played by Reiko Aylesworth and who is obviously introduced as the next Ripley just isn't convincing as an action-gal or indeed a potential saviour of Earth. Some of the technology used by the Predator is too far fetched (yes, even for a sci-fi film of this ilk) and parts of the dialogue is a little sketchy.However, I think I can safely say that the Strause Brothers are  like me  huge fans of Cameron's 1986 Aliens. The intertextual references to Aliens (and Predator) are vast and for me were there to be lapped up (note how the title is now 'Aliens vs' and not 'Alien vs'). This film is a homage to the original films and if the powers that be decide to finance another project I'd be more than happy to hear that the Strause Brothers were again at the helm.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Last week I stumbled over the unrated blu-ray edition and I thought ""OK, I'm still a huge fan of the original Alien and Predator films, let's give it a try without expecting anything"". And what I get was an entertaining Gore(Splatter)-Movie made like the good old classics in the 80's. Even the plot is better than AVP1. OK that's not so hard to accomplish, but the conclusion is when you are willing to watch that film detached from the original franchises you get a well-made, old-style Gore-Movie.

I saw it in the theater with a less-than, shall we say, sophisticated audience. Nevertheless, even the pinheads in that audience were laughing at the ridiculous lines. There was nothing interesting about the story or the characters. The fights between the Predator and the Aliens were so dark and indistinct that I couldn't tell who was hitting who.

Maybe the portly fanboys should stay home and watch their reruns of Babylon 5 rather than attempting to comment on a film with solid acting, storyline, and FX (like Codeine cough syrup, watching ""Enterprise"" reruns more than once a month causes one to forget what those things are). Guys who spend most of their time staring at pictures of Bea Arthur in their basements don't rate high on my ""critics"" scale.As for me, I was extremely surprised at the ""bring it home"" storyline and key elements that were included in this film. They even kept the faith with such homages to Sigourney Weaver's famous APC driving scene from ""Aliens"" and even the some of the cool alien sound effects used by James Cameron. The fear and horror elements of the film were also true-to-life and really struck up the ""what would you do"" thinking we've all done regarding these horrific creatures. The ending was even great and left the door open for future work. I walked out of the theatre feeling refreshed, given that the first AVP left me a little less than impressed (despite Lance Henriksen's typically fantastic work).This film certainly restored my faith in the franchise - whether Sigourney ever comes back or not (but we hope she will!)

But it lost its momentum during the end of the movie, which literally spoiled it and ended in a way that creation of another sequel is possible. Another huge disappointment was that the new predator did not have much special hand-to-hand fighting capabilities as compared to the previous predators, he was rather shown most the time either fiddling with his superficial gadgets or pouring that odd looking blue acidic liquid on dead bodies. *MINOR SPOILER ALERT* And a lame give-away plot hole erupted nearing the end of the movie, when the guy named 'Dallas' picks up the predator gun and starts shooting the aliens! If I remember correctly, in the previous AVP the humans were never able to figure out how to use that thing. Anyways lets hope that they don't spoil it for the next one!

First off why would you think that in the first place? Are you stupid? Maybe...no you are.This movie however does surpass the first installment which lacks what the title represents. AVP:R exactly describes what this whole movie about, we get to see worthy scenes of the Predator facing off numerous aliens and showing who is the supreme science fiction creature of all time. Forget the humans, they are not important, it's obvious in this movie. For once the focus of attention is exactly where it needs to be, the predator and the aliens.To conclude this so called review, this movie is fun to watch.

If there is one predator who is going to fight, it should be that strongest and biggest one we saw at the end of the first movie. not just a grown up predator. and why every time the monsters go so some place that nobody ever saw them before? it's not fun any more, it kills the fun. it would be more interesting if the town's people heard about the monsters, in a movie or by a rumor, anything. and at the end, if you want it to be requiem like the title, all the predators should have come to help their fellow and kill the aliens, and all the 2 sides monsters should gather in one place and have one big fight, except for -Alienator-(not Predalien) and the predator who faced him. that way: we could see what we were waiting for since we heard the title AVP before we saw the first disappointing movie with shorten fights. (2 fights or 3 ). we were waiting for a huge fight, a big number of both to fight a giant fight. and then the bomb which destroyed everything will kill the two monsters and that will be the end...but the predators still in their planet they only lost one? so what's that Requiem, only for the aliens? why? predators are not important?

As a casual movie viewer I was disappointed by the bad script, acting, story, and lighting. As a hard core fan I was disappointed in the fast face-hugger incubation times and the overall design of the predalien. My biggest problem with the whole film is that it's too dark, to the point that you can't even make out half the fights. This movie also had an extremely high gore level, and I'm sure a lot of people will say ""well their clearly make-believe so the violence won't be that bad"", you are wrong. This movie pulls no punches and anyone (and I do mean anyone) can die, and die a slow horrible death. In total only 3 out of the 6 fights are decent, and they are extremely short. The only time the movie felt right was when the predator was in it, both the predalien and human characters felt very poorly done.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Reasonably good.,8,8 October 2010,"I have always wondered what would happen if aliens ever invaded earth in modern times and I finally get an answer. It reminds me of aliens 2 (best one of them all). The town is fully occupied and we get to see what happens from start to Finnish. I just had to review this title because I had no idea why it was getting slammed so badly. I suppose there are some holes in it, such as the predator in this feels like he really has no purpose being here. The predator basically just feels like some random put in to pass the time. They would have been better getting rid of the predator and calling this alien invaders. They're may be some familiar faces out there if you are a fan of Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis which I am, LT ford from Atlantis plays a very small roll in this and another character who's name escapes me but if you watch SG1 than you will definitely recognize him. The acting was well done and most the characters were very believable and you cared whether they lived or died.If your looking for a deep compelling plot, than this is not for you, but if you are looking for an action movie that is quit a bit of fun to watch and maybe even have a laugh at which extra will go next than this is for you. 8/10 very enjoyable and I really hope to see more.

An CGI chest-burster is very unconvincing, lighting is so dark I never know what the hell is happening, and lots of B-movie plot and dismal characters. I mean find an insult to the over all once respectable franchises.The sole Predator in this movie is pretty cool, but everything else sucks. This movie actually gets funny!

AvP 2 starts exactly here by letting the Predator's ship crash on the earth again and the aliens escape. From now on, everything that's happening are fights between predator and aliens, humans and aliens or even humans and the predator (Yes, there's only one in this movie). So why 7/10 Stars? Well, i liked the idea of aliens invading a town in contemporary setting, revealing how helpless the humans are in such a situation. On the other hand, most of the action and gore scenes are well made in my opinion. And hey, i guess action and gore are the main reason for most of the people to watch this movie.

What happened?There really isn't much of a story told in Requiem which is disgraceful given the time this franchise has had to put something decent together. The Aliens/Predator comics from the early 1990s provided many great ideas to wrap around such an epic clash of sci-fi titans and yet these have been largely ignored by the script writers of both AVP films, particularly Requiem. If you're expecting a truly suspenseful, shocking, scary story oozing creativity, imagination and stand out scenes and effects like you get with Predator, Alien and Aliens, you're going to be sorely disappointed.Continuing immediately on from the end of the first AVP film (which I hate to say is the better film in my opinion), not a great deal happens. I kid you not. Predator fights Alien in the usual way around some rural, small American town, gormless people you don't care about die at regular intervals, predictable stuff happens throughout and the ending delivers a lazy, effortless opening for another sequel. No character development, no plot twists or decent surprises to be had here!I must say too that Requiem is really dark, but not in a moody, atmospheric way! After checking that the Brightness on your TV isn't set low, you're left struggling to make out what's going on throughout much of the film!

The monster fights are pretty awesome and this Predator is one of my favorite ones, but every human, let me repeat that, EVERY HUMAN is annoyingly bad. That being said, if someone could fan edit this movie, showing only the predator and alien parts, I'd probably give it a 7 or 8 out of 10.

I didn't like the first AvP movie because it wasn't violent enough, and the idea of the predator teaming up with a human is just not acceptable! But this time around its nothing like that, in this film the humans are nothing but victims to events of horrible deaths. And thats just how it should be. Turn of your brain and don't think about plots or good acting because in that case you will be disappointed.

Ridley Scott created a groundbreaking masterpiece with his first movie ""Alien"". James Cameron respected the mastery of the original when he produced the excellent sequel ""Aliens"". So where did it all go wrong? Alien vs Predator 2 learns from none of the mistakes made by the first Alien vs Predator movie. The dialog is terrible with weak and inane characters that you really just don't care about. It's plot is weak and lucid at the best of times with so many gaping holes that it insults the intelligence of the viewer. The editing is displayed at such a pace that it renders you wondering what you have missed; some scenes are simply unviewable. I struggled in the climactic battle towards the end to figure out what was going on. The Alien-Predator hybrid is so similar to the Predator that with the editing and darkness it was virtually impossible to distinguish what was what in the final scenes. To its credit in some parts it paid homage to the original movies but did so simply by recreating famous scenes in a way that drained them of all of the suspense and sense of doom that made those films what they were. I think for me that sums this movie up. There simply wasn't any tension, any drama or any thrill-a-minute set pieces to make the viewer actually sit up and want to pay attention. It's a real shame, it really is because these movies could be so much better. Is it now time to give the franchise a well earned rest?",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
475,pgtc,A lesson on how to destroy a franchise,1,10 February 2008,"Don't be fooled - this is THE pits. Actually, even calling this a movie is an overstatement. It's just a collection of (mostly boring) scenes with almost no connection between them. There's no real storyline, no reason for anything, basically some ships fall from space for no apparent reason (why can't they just land?) and a Predator creature starts stalking some of the alien creatures, taking out some humans in the process. Most basic concepts of the series are simply ignored, like the alien reproduction - originally a mother alien would lay eggs, and from these eggs baby aliens would come out and look for a host to develop themselves. Now it seems that any alien can just insert baby aliens inside anyone. Acting is as poor as can be, character development is null, and all that's left to watch are some reasonable creature models. But the lack of any kind of sense to anything makes it painfully hard to keep watching till the end - which is, of course, an atomic bomb dropped on the infested town and that's it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
476,ari_burd,This is it?,3,9 February 2009,"I'm a long time fan of these franchises. To understand where I'm coming from, I consider Alien and Aliens to be masterpieces of science fiction. Alien 3 to be a good horror movie and Alien 4 to be a bad movie with a few enjoyable parts. Predator 1 and 2 I highly enjoyed, though I'm the first to admit they're not exactly works of art. AVP 1 was lackluster at best, though there was some attempt at character development and moments of enjoyment.So now to this movie...ugggh. You know it's bad when you can guess the entire plot of the film (literally) from the previews. There's a big bad Alien/Predator hybrid whose killing a town, there's a Predator hunting him down (but killing everything/everyone in the process). The government can't be trusted and eventually, the cast of survivors has to decide whether to wait for help or to take matters into their own hands and ""get to the chopper!"" It's INCREDIBLY predictable in every way. In fact, not even can you guess who will live and who will die (not generally hard in these franchises), but you'll actually be able to figure out WHEN they die and HOW with little effort.Directors, the ""Brother Struase"" have departed from AVP 1 in that this is truly attempting to be as much a gore flick as it is an action flick. It's filled with faces being melted by acid, decapitations, exploding stomachs...you name it. Sadly, they seem to think that all this gore will make you forget that there should be an interesting story or some real tension. Rather than do anything original, they literally steal from all of the other films. There's the military guys screaming ""it's an ambush,"" there's the ""get to the chopper"" line, aliens coming out of the walls...there's even a little girl asking her mommy about the ""monsters""... It's called paying homage if you do it with your own style, it's called stealing if you use the same lines, sounds and scenes to do the exact same thing. It's shameful. I used to tell my friends if I could fight anyone, I'd fight Justin Timberlake or Dr. Phil. After this flick, the Brothers Strause just moved to #1.I can't understand why it's so hard to come up with a decent story. I mean, it's not like there was all that much to the other films, but at least they kept you entertained and you empathized with the characters. You could point to the charisma of Arnold, Danny Glover, Bill Paxton or Sigourney Weaver, to claim that's why those films succeeded while this one fails, but you really can't blame the actors for this one. Arnold and Co. could have been in this movie and it would still be second rate. If you don't believe, me, ask Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman if good acting can save a terrible script. Anyway, the problem isn't the acting (other than a few very annoying teenagers)....this movie contains a veritable whose who of b-list sci-fi actors you'll recognize from shows such as Battlestar Galactica, X-Files, True Blood, Stargate Atlantis, etc...most of whom clearly have the acting chops.In the end, if you're like me, you're going to see this movie b/c you have strong feelings about the franchise. Just know, there will be some cool effects, some fun action, but overall, you'll just sit back and say...man, I could've done better than this!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

The story is weak, the acting is mediocre and the special-effects are OK. It doesn't pretend to be great, something I really like nowadays. For me that was a big part of the fun.

I am a subscriber to a theater, so I don't pay for movies individualy and I'm not sure if I would have paid top dollar for this one.

The problem with the movie is just a single one: it pretends to be a good movie. It wants very hard. It meaning all people behind it. It is sometimes to watch middle quality B or even C movie - these people do not pretend they do blockbusters. They just tell story with some ambitions but we all feel there is an understanding. Here I felt someone has just ripped me off!

During more than 90 minutes there was only one scene that got my attention - while main characters got to hospital, the blonde started to run and got killed by this flying device Predator threw. Only 2 minutes of good movie. The producers might have better sold this as ""content"" to some other producers. Anyway I am totally disappointed. What I saw was a product for Game fans.

Nonetheless, anyone with a sense should immediately notice that this is not Alien, this is not Aliens, and this is not Predator. If your OK with these statements so far, then venture on ahead...Aliens: in my opinion one of the greatest films ever, probably only surpassed by Titanic, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Gladiator, or 300. The dialog fits SO well with the characters and this is one of the films that fans would have wanted to be for about 3, 4, or maybe even 5 hours LONGER!!! I personally love Hudson, probably my favorite movie character EVER!!! His lines have so much personality that it just fits, Vasquez is incredible, the bad-ass who acts tough, in tough situations and Hicks, who surpasses his courage mark, whenever is needed. 10/10 No Doubt...Predator: The next big step besides aliens. While everyone hounded over Alien, and Aliens, real fans wanted to know what the next movie was. Of course not Alien 3. But we wanted something new, something more dangerous that had a mind of its own, and something that could surpass our own knowledge. Im talking about Predator. When John, Arnold, and Jesse signed on, you knew this was gonna be a new movie all in its own. This movie is filled with gun battles, trickery, and stealth. Not exactly the fast paced action movie. But still... an incredible ride nonetheless..... 10/10 Of course.AVP: Sucked. Story sucked, characters suck, the whole idea sucked and everything that Paul touched in this movie just... Sucked. 3/10 (I admit the last battle was pretty intense, and the whole moving pyramid should get some credit) Now the moment of truth.AVP Requiem: I was so looking forward to see this movie. The trailer looked awesome, and the effects were stunning. They were. The idea of a predator cleaning up after a whole town, flooded with aliens is pretty cool. But the script, dialog, and story... It just... feels rushed. I despise the day that the galaxy lies on the back of a pizza boy deliverer to save the town, come on. The first time i saw this my reaction was ""Sweet, awesome guns, awesome action, awesome effects, what more can a 14 year old boy want?"" But I'm not like a lot of other people. I really look for a story too. Thats why Gladiator, Terminator 2, Aliens, and 300 are my favorite movies. After the movie, i said ""I gotta see it again and see if it has the same affect on me"" So i went for the 2nd time, sure enough the greatness that was in the 1st time was absolutely not there. ""This story sucks, develop the characters, this is no aliens, why in the world would one predator bring his whole armory to Earth with him?"" I couldn't wait to get out of the theater, SOOOO many plot holes, SOOOO cheesy dialog, SOOOO much that James Cameron could've made better.Overall: Aliens Rocks, Predator Rocks, AVP Sucks, now with that data, put it into AVP2 and you'll come out with an answer for yourself.

Within the first 10 minutes my intelligence was insulted to a degree that told me that this film no matter how cool it could be, isn't going to improve.It destroys everything good about the original alien, and predator movies. It adds absolutely NOTHING.Here's a few spoilers that will tell you just how stupid this movie is.When a space ship crashes into the earth from outer space, at terminal velocity, you cannot walk over the hill to it, after seeing it crash land from MILES AWAY. You cannot get near the crash as the temperature would likely burn you, not to mention radiation. Let's also not forget the explosive impact that would have left about 10 miles of forest destroyed killing our father and son duo who are out there hunting deer.Then... What do Predators do when they know they're going to get killed by the locals? That's right. They go nuclear. This way they kill their enemy, and never leave a trace. What happens here? Apparently THIS PUSSY PREDATOR CALLS PREDATOR 9-11!!! Then there's the instantaneous call that the predator cop on duty gets on the predator homeworld, and can be there in minutes after the call.

Arnald can make a cameo.My favourite part about this movie was the ""zombie"" like feel as the alien reproduced like rats and swarmed the town. All the why the Predator kept trying to cover up the Alien invasion and the a few town folk were thinking they stood a chance! There is much humour in this movie... overall it's a treat to escape the holiday season doldrums!!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

His designing. He looks and is great 2. His shoulder gun. Great 3. His wolverine claws. GreatLets see the best parts of the Alien 1. Designing. Great 2. Acid blood and terror factor. Great 3. Adaptability and intelligence. GreatWhat can go wrong?!So lets see the Predators bad parts. 1. No fun without his Ironman / batman gadgetry 2. Boring in hand to hand 3. Many goofs and problems in AVPR. Viz. unlimited blue liquid erasing evidence, aliens impregnating pregnant women (for what?)Now lets see Alien bad parts 1. Killing technique. Dude, something hard coming out of your mouth to kill is not GREAT 2. No more ninja technique in killing 3. Alienator / Predalien hybrid? Useless. In design, technique and utility.So what would have made these movies great  again? 1. Do away with the awful interludes of human interactions 2. Alienator / Predalien should have had been retrofitted with gadgets 3. Take out the human element. Or at least bring back a Dutch- like character! Someone not like the Rock or Schwartsnegger or the Pianist (Adrien Brooding ;) ), but like a combo of Kate Beckinsale, Uma Thurman, Scarlett Johansson, Milla Jovovich, Rhona Mitra, Michelle Yeoh, Michelle Rodriguez, Noomi Rapace (in no order of preference). You get the picture.So someone either listen to the above or get me in as special consultant. You don't need the name to make the money. Great movies will make money. Lets make Predator / Aliens / AVP / Prometheus / Covenant great again! I can definitely do it, but next time, don't fornicate it up  please.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
489,sammy-80,"An improvement, but not quite there yet",6,27 January 2008,"I believe some people are treating this film a tad too harshly. Sure, it is nowhere near on par with the first three alien and first predator films, but it definitely outclasses the earlier AVP.The characters certainly have a long way to go before becoming as appealing as those of earlier installments, but they're definitely an improvement over the utterly annoying personifications seen in Alien Resurrection and AVP1.As for special effects, I was genuinely surprised at how sparingly CGI was used for the Predators and adult aliens, including the giant hybrid. Even the fast paced fight sequences between the species are evocative of late 80's, early 90's alien/predator films with the lack of flashy, computerised acrobatics.6/10. A good effort at trying to be more evocative of earlier installments and being less child friendly, but still lacks the art and originality of the earlier films.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

492,andrew-757,"Far from perfect, but much better than AVP",10,28 December 2007,"I guess I could best sum things up with: It's far from perfect, but it's noticeably better than AVP and has a hundred times the balls.It's not like any Alien or Predator movie before it, or even bares much more of a similarity to AVP other than the obvious... ensemble hodgepodge group of humans becoming tangled in an Aliens and Predators plot. Except it's nothing like it. You try to stack this against Ridley's Alien or Cameron's Aliens or even McTiernan's Predator, it's not quite comparing apples to apples -- not because those are better films (but they are, obviously), but because they're telling entirely different kinds of stories from an entirely different perspective. So don't expect to find any kind of ""inner message"" in the movie beyond some kind of vague ""man destroys man"" thing.It's like several characters' stories eventually intertwining together, and then there's the Predator (yes, just one, but they get just as much mileage out of him as all the Predators combined in the last AVP) sort of doing his own thing out there, his path occasionally intersecting with the humans. The violence and death often comes sudden, brutally, and without warning... I like it. Plenty of homage-type stuff, not that it ever really becomes too distracting and not that I necessarily give the movie extra points for including them. One sequence bares more than a little similarity to the APC rescue scene from Aliens (you'll know it when you see it). Other little odds and ends here and there, and if you're looking you'll see the Aliens doing things from all 4 Aliens movies (swimming, scampering over ceilings, blood-spitting, tail-impaling, etc. etc.). The Predator, too, and more (the directors call him a ""cleaner"" in a recent interview with good reason... though when you see him doing it in the movie, you're kind of left seeing the futility of it when there's all these dozens and dozens of Aliens propagating all over the forest/town/sewers). Lots of musical cues you'll pick up on, often at familiar sort of times. Gore? Plenty. Chestbusters burst and you see it, even with ribs cracking open and out. One scene is particularly disturbing... perhaps more disturbing than anything else in the previous movies. It has to do with a hospital and the PredAlien's unique reproductive cycle... Oh, and remember we met Weyland in the last one? Well... guess who we meet in this one.The bad: It does seem that it noticeably has a lower budget. Often times you'll only see an Alien from the neck up, or knees down, and only extremely close up. And it looks like the Aliens' secondary jaw is mostly all CGI here, and when it's being used -- repeatedly -- into a skull, it doesn't look very convincing at all. Also the fighting itself with the Predator... it seems like they took a page from ""Batman Begins"" and shoot all the action very close-up, quick/smash cut... unfortunately, when the only source of illumination is dim blue light off-camera and things are moving extremely fast, you can't see what the **** is going on at times. Sometimes all I could see is like a flurry of dreadlocks... and I couldn't always even tell if it was the Predalien's or the Predator's, to say the least. Also, and I'm sad to say some of my biggest fears were true: the previews? The clips and spots we've seen so far on the internet? Yeah, they pretty much do show the best, most SFX-pleasing sequences in the movie, and also do give away a very, very large aspect of the ending (*cough*ROTLD*cough*). And also I'm not sure why they even bothered to give the Aliens the ridged heads when I'm not even sure there's a single sequence in the entire movie where you can say with any certainty that you see them.I don't want to, but I can't help but look at AVP 1 for the following observation. Worthless Sh*t Anderson filmed a sissified movie a couple of years ago, but one thing I can't fault him for is the way he did succeed in keeping the audience's eye on the ball. A Cameronian approach of, ""Let's keep the ball moving, fast, fast, one thing to the next, boom boom"" and even if there's plot holes the audience isn't apt to notice or care because they get swept up in the momentum of the movie. Here, in AVP2, it starts off a little slow and a little awkwardly, and you don't really get a good sense of the movie really coming together until about 30-40 minutes into it... but by that point it's all mostly good times and you probably won't dwell too much on those first 30-40 minutes. But yeah... no nonsense bullet-time facehuggers or any MTV rubbish that I can speak of.My ranking of the films now:Aliens Alien Predator AVP:R Predator 2 Alien: Resurrection AVP Alien 3",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
493,killy_nl,Disgusting slasher movie,1,6 February 2008,"I really liked Alien 1-n, Predator 1 (the rest was crap) and especially AVP 1. But this sequel is a simple blood spilling slasher movie. The first two dead humans are a father and his 8 year old sun, which are exploding before your eyes. But the worst is when AlienPredator-Mama implants her eggs to very pregnant women through their throat and, off course, they explode shortly afterwards. That's gross, bad taste, disgusting. A really splatter movie. The acting is sooo bad, there isn't one single character developing, not even the alien or the predator : all of them get immediately slaught and spill their red/green blood all over the place. I really much preferred AVP1: a good story, horror, SF, action, a *real* main characters which develop throughout the movie. Nothing to do with this awful bloody splatter movie.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
494,dan_of_the_year,Perfect for fans of gore and explosions who aren't that picky.,6,18 January 2008,"Neither of the the Alien vs. Predator movies do much to live up to the legacy of the franchises that cross over. But if you keep that in mind as you see these movies and have some very low expectations, there is a chance you might enjoy this.What made Alien and Predator so great was the suspense. The creatures were never clearly exposed at once, but they were creeping up on their victims who barely suspected anything until it was too late. Here we start where the first movie left off, with the Predalien being born. The closest thing to suspense we ever get is when the doctor at the hospital sees the ECG monitors flatline, which was quite impressive, but very brief. The scariest thing that ever happened was the pizza delivery guy getting jumped from behind by a bully.The characters are poorly done and forgettable. You never get to know them like the crew of Nostromo, the Special Force or the L.A. cops. People that easily could earn sympathies, making you go ""Nooo!!"" when they are done for. Here we have dozens of people who are as nameless as they are pointless, two brothers who have had some trouble with the law and a female soldier who seems to have returned from some place such as Afghanistan. But she might just have shot some paintball during the weekend, that's how little information we get. To put it simply, too much people with too little exposition.But if you get into this simply to see two different breeds of monsters fight and cause a great mess, this might be the right flick for you. Humans are taken down like bowling pins and there is barely anything to hold them back. Those who appreciate horror and aren't too sensitive might appreciate the dark tone set by the number and age of the creatures' victims. Being old enough to drink is not required to be one of them, that's for sure. Also the blackouts combined with the rain makes a nice mood for what happens at the hospital, if only a little tacked on.The biggest of the few high points is the open ending, suggesting a connection between the realities of the past of Predator and the future of Alien. I imagine that if there will ever be another sequel this would be further explored and probably make a far better movie. But is it a redeeming quality for Alien Versus Predator - Requiem? Hardly.Decent braindead action, but there are much better things to see, whether you're easily entertained or are more demanding.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

496,http_dougie,"Hadley's Hope? LV-426?! Oops! I mean Gunnison, Colorado.",7,27 December 2007,"Okay, let's get the basic crap out of the way that everyone else is spitting out. The movie very, very, very much mirrors ALIENS. Everything from armed forces involvement, cover-up, female lead (who ends up driving the tank-thing), and the list grows, but please let's all keep an open mind. Just because it may be be inspired by, take ideas from, or even straight up copy the damn film, it doesn't mean it's an automatic bad film! So let's continue...Now I'll spurt out my opinions, ready? Good.A couple negatives... I thought the stage wasn't really laid out as best as it could have been. There are so many scenes, so many environments, and so many stories going out that it was hard to figure out where they tied together. Not to spoil anything, but I had no clue where the hell the power plant was in relation to the crash site, or the hospital to the center of town. There were times in the film I thought the aliens had simply crossed borders and we were seeing something elsewhere because there wasn't really any clear stage set.Additionlly, the whole atmosphere wasn't as it could've been, in my opinion. This is an ALIEN and PREDATOR film, even if it runs under the title AVP. Atmosphere is essential in setting the stage for where and how these creatures will exist. The battle is a given, because one is hunting the other, but come on!! Give us a stage like the Nostromo, or LV-426 (it is 426, right? I don't pretend to be an expert or anything, but I think that's it), or even that damn detention/prison planet. Alien 1-3 set the stages beautifully, introducing the environment, it's isolation, showing you specific locations which would be explored thoroughly later, and well, whatever...Continuing w/my overly opinionated negatives, I'd add the characters and their development were poorly executed. While I said you shouldn't condemn a film just because it's a copy, doesn't mean that I agree it'll be a great one. Honestly, I don't care that this guy is a pizza delivery boy, or someone used to be some thief, or why the hell did that woman come home after being in the Army looking as good as she did?! She had make-up on, she looked beautiful, very well groomed. I'm not saying it's not totally unlikely, but I would expect anyone just getting out of any military service to look more relaxed, natural, and not made-up for a night on the town.I think those were my biggest gripes. Environment, atmosphere, and character development. Wow! Is that all?! ...and yet I still ranked it a 7, and here's why...The special effects were very nice. I thought everything felt very fluid.This movie was more graphic than the first AVP, and in some ways even beat out the other Alien and Predator films, but not so much the Pred since those were always pretty graphic. A young boy, early in the film, being one of the first victims of a face hugger was great. Getting to see the town collapse was also pretty spiffy. For a long time I had thought they should do an ALIEN film set on LV-426 before aliens took over the compound. I would love to see how everything went crazy, when the queen was born, and stuff. This film kind of did that, but weakly. Continuing about it's brutality though, I was very surprised about the use of pregnant mothers to birth what looked like 5 aliens at once. It was creative, a little disturbing, but was one of those moments like in The Hills Have Eyes when the young girl gets raped. You don't know what to think.Ya know, this review is really friggin' long. Ain't it?! So I'll cut to the chase instead of ripping it to shreds and over-analyzing what is just (I hope) meant to be a fun, action, iconic film.AVPR was exactly that: a fun, action, iconic film. Aliens and Predators barely need introductions. Their battle continues, but this time in Colorado, which is a nice place to try something new since the closest any Alien or Pred film got a town was in Predator 2, but that wasn't as suburb-y as this. The characters aren't really that developed, but let's face it, the stars are the creatures. Humans are there to be killed, eaten, or incubated. The characters who were essential to the story didn't have any story arcs or anything to which they grew from the experience. There was nothing gained from the film, and a new chapter wasn't really written in the Alien or Predator legacy. I will say, however, I am wrong. The very last scene in the movie IS something new to the legacy, and I was very much hoping to see something like this: the introduction of Miss Yutani. Weyland-Yutani in AVP3?! I have ideas... Maybe when this Writer's Strike is over, I'll try my hand. =o)",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
497,nrice-07604,After all those astounding Alien and Predator films...THIS???,1,26 October 2017,"Gah, I can't even begin with how mind-numbingly terrible this movie is. I personally loved Alien vs Predator, but it's sequel is barely watchable. So the Predalien crash lands into Colorado where it starts to kill people. Then, an elder predator, Wolf, comes down to stop it. Sounds innocent enough, right? You have never been more wrong. The characters are all so unlikeable and annoying (just DIE already!!) it's not even funny, considering how they're all angsty teenagers. And before you pull the whole ""well ALL teenage characters are unlikeable'', Freddy vs Jason and the Friday the 13th series had tons of good teen characters. There are so many Alien 3 and Aliens references it's not even funny anymore. Acting is subpar to the point where you can't even watch it. BUT THE LIGHTING IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE WORST. I CAN'T EVEN SEE ANYTHING COOL! All the awesome battle scenes are filmed in the pitch black. You can have good night battle scenes, as Pacific Rim shows us, but this is unacceptable. The Alien costumes are so bad-they're literally re-used from the film Aliens! From 1986! You can plainly see the suits falling apart throughout the film. It's awful. A huge middle finger to two of the most iconic sci-fi franchises of all time. Alien and Predator deserve better! I mean, Alien has gotten over it, but Predator is still recovering from the trauma!

No bad ass final fight.Now I liked the first AVP. Yea, it was pg13 but whocares, it had a good plot, and some sweet action scenes. If AVP was R it would have been a really great movie, instead of just a good entertaining flick.AVP-R looked badass. And there are some cool fight scenes, but the film is very anti-climactic. The ending just blew. The final fight between the Predator and the Hybrid started off good but went no where fast, plus the fight really didn't end. The plot, well was there even a plot. I mean grant you its AVP and all but still its a film and it should try and go somewhere, AVP 1 did that, but this one does not.Then there is like 3 times when it seems like the movie is about to end, but it keeps going. I've seen lord of the rings, with its 12 endings, lets forget this non ending BS.This will help like 90% of the people that see this film, the chick at the end works for the weyland company. Weyland is bishop from the alien franchise, and the old rich business guy from AVP. Thats why she knew about the gun. At first I thought she was the Chick from the original Predator who owned the corporation, but until I got home and hopped on here I didn't realize she was a Weyland person. Honestly, not many people will make the connection, the theater I was in most people kept asking about who that chick was and why it didn't make sense.Overall, its not that good. This really could have been a badass film. But I think the whole, its going to be R so lets just gore it up really didn't work. I loved that idea but you still need a plot and kick ass final showdown, which does not happen. Very disappointing.p.s. Predator was still a badass. nuff said.5/10",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
500,demoneyeslaharl,Decent transition...,7,8 February 2008,"While generally, the film is being hung by the fans as the worse movie to ever grace the Alien/Predator and even the AVP spin-off franchise, I believe its a case of the movie being hyped up, and ultimately, not living up to its promises. I mean... what did people expect, from a low budget, set on Earth (right after AVP no less) with first time directors? If you judge this film as it is, it isn't as bad as everyone is saying. The saving grace of the film is Wolf, the Predator. After what happened to AVP, we finally got a Predator that moves and acts like one. He's good at what he does, and being in his shoes is one of the best things the movie has to offer, even if wasn't that much. The music itself is also its strongest point... it helped set the mood more, and was a joy to listen to.Other than erratic pacing, short run time, limited direction and crappy story, and lastly, the Aliens getting the really short stick here, its a decent film to watch mindlessly. Its not Predator 1, 2, nor the classic Alien and Aliens, but its a decent transition for the AVP franchise.I'll be expecting better next time though.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

There are a few sad examples of earlier special-effects people who also thought they can bring it as a director:Spawn by Mark Dippé, Starship Troopers 2 by Phil Tippett, The Fly II by Chris Walas and some other more.Maybe next time, in 5 or 6 years, when it's all water under the bridge, they choose a really talented director, who makes a totally new beginning of it all with a higher budget of 150 million dollars, a fascinating script and some really strong actors.I want a huge difference between the movies like it was between Batman & Robin and Batman Begins!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Once I saw that red R glistening after the AvP, I was excited. As it turns out, I was right. Certainly there is a good amount of gore in AvPR, melting limbs, dismemberments, even some violence against children. The Predator is once again, the most bad-ass extraterrestrial on Earth, and it was fun to see the infamous predalien.

Everything else went -- AVPR doesn't have even AVP's feeble attempts at character development, storyline, humor, coherence, and worst of all, suspense...No one expects another Citizen Kane from an Alien vs Predator movie, but we do expect a tense film that would keep us on the edge of our seats. AVPR isn't it. Characters come and go so quickly we don't care if their heads are blown up. In fact, it makes about the same impact as blowing up the head of a couple of mannequins. The fight scenes between the monsters -- which, let's admit, are its main selling point -- are so poorly lit and messy one doesn't get any guilty pleasure from them.How on earth do you manage to make a non-scary, non-suspenseful film by combining the two scariest monsters to have ever been created on-screen?

There are a few holes in the plot but that didn't bother me at all because this film is meant to be fun and exciting which I felt it was. There are some good action scenes and some good gore scenes; everything an AvsP movie should be like. So if you like to watch movies that take you on a ride for an hour and a half to make you forget those weary work days, do yourself a favor and experience this film. See it, rent it, or buy it. Either way I'm sure you will enjoy it. Just remember that this is an AvsP movie and it's not supposed to be serious; it's meant to be fun. All in all, I think it was good film, hence the 7/10 rating.

Before I give this film the good ol' Homer Simpson 7 thumbs down I need to tell you how it came to be that I actually sat through this turkey so big it could only have been descended from a dinosaur. I ordered two movies over the net...PREDATOR (1987) and ALIEN (1979)...both of which I have seen and enjoyed but wanted a DVD copy...instead I was sent this masterpiece of cliché and boredom. First the acting...as if it could be given that verb without a seismic ripple throughout Hollywood...sometimes you hear acting called *wooden*...well this film plumbs the depths of wooden acting and eventually finds itself as CONCRETE...plummeting towards the squalid depths of some murky harbor in a third world city. The characters run the complete gamut - from apathetic to just plain pathetic - I've seen more emotional range from barnacles. There is a refreshing unity to the apathy tho like it was a bunch of small time criminals doing community service by marionetting throughout the flick. Let's tackle the plot...amazing really that so little could be made of the combination of a predator that predates (no pun intended) some space shuttle disasters meeting an alien discovered some 400 years hence...with humorous results. The appalling attempts at *homage* (god...I hope it was intended as homage) are so risible that I actually laughed out loud at two points (both of which were apparently intended as emotional scenes). To sum up...a cash cow being milked by an ideologically-bankrupt part of Hollywood finally kills the cow...cooks it...tries to eat it and spits it out as too distasteful to digest.

Plus we get to see the Predator homeworld and also a great little teaser at the end re 'The Company'. More gruesome deaths than you can shake a stick at too - no PG-13 here. And to be honest I thought the effects and the story were miles ahead of AVP.So for Gawds sake - RELAX. This film is not trying to challenge Scott or Camerons vision.

He couldn't hit an Alien for a million bucks. C'mon, I thought this was a Predator not a blind(not true, but still) tall guy running around in a latex suit(sarcasm of course). The Aliens were much much horrible. Their color was too unbelievable. Most of the ugliness was covered up by the rain, but at moments you can see the Aliens aren't organic and/or don't have slime. The Aliens shape was another story - James Cameron's ALIENS was the base... well, they said it was... but, I don't believe it. These look nothing like those purdy Aliens in ALIENS. And Woah. The PredAlien's new way of reproducing startled me and I hated it, and will remain to hate it. Besides the utterly awful reproducing method it's a great character. I'd think it's better in an A rating movie than B rating, but that's just me. Overall.... The story is filled with plots holes, bad acting, and stupid shtuff.Besides these ugly factors you see before you, I'm rating it an 8 for just the fights scenes...though they could of been better in a way.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
510,pgray2,Could've been good...if you could see it...,4,21 April 2008,"The premise of the movie had potential. It truly could've been a good movie, if you could actually see anything happening in the movie. My girlfriend and I rented it and watched it last night. Even after turning all the lights off in the house, making our 52'' HD TV the only thing lighting the room in an attempt to make it possible to see what was happening, still 98% of the fighting were impossible to see due to the poor lighting the filmmakers chose to use.Pros: The Predator was awesome as always. Some of the acting was decent.Cons: There was no cronological story. Characters were introduced so briefly you didn't care about them. Minimal suspense. As outlined above, you couldn't see any of the parts that mattered due to the poor camera/lighting work. The ending was retarded.I'm in agreement with another review I read on here yesterday where someone said they'd like to pretend this movie was never made so as not to ruin the entire franchise on both sides.Overall, a great idea that could've been. Thanks to ""The Brothers Strausse"" for jacking it up. Although I can't blame it all on them anymore than you can blame an 8 year old for wrecking mom's SUV when she asks him to move it (hah). The Fox executives who hired these clowns are mainly to blame. This pair of bumbling idiots just weren't ready for something this large (although they should've been, given their background in the industry).Here's to hoping the next film will re-energize the series if a decent director is hired to do the job.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
511,KissKissBangBangV2,Vastly underrated franchise entry,8,26 July 2010,"I really do not understand the animosity towards this film, it finally lets the Aliens loose on Earth, they decimate an entire town, killing mercilessly and people moan?Maybe it's me, I like suspenseful and inventive horror movies and AvPR tries to do something new with characters we have now seen in quite a few movies, its the most horror entry in either the Alien or Predator franchise since the first Alien film, its dark, literally, the cast are picked off in surprising ways and the ones that survive are few. Maybe people just got used to moaning about these types of films as they forgot how to enjoy cinema? a lot of the moaning online seems to consist of people saying the same complaints about the film which if you watch it with fair eyes it doesn't seem to do, its exciting, well paced, has interesting characters, adds something new to the overall myths of the 2 creatures and always strives to scare.See it for yourself and decide, don't believe the negative hype.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
512,SilverGrimmSnow,"Probably the worst, but best in my opinion",10,12 October 2011,"Alien vs Predator 2: Requiem wasn't the best, but one of my other alien films I've seen. I've seen some under-rated actors and especially the bad acting.The CGI in the film wasn't extremely prefect, but it was great when the people who did the CGI made the aliens, predators, and other visual effects amazing. I would say that the directors, scriptwriters, (etc.) did a very awful job in this film when trying to make this sequel more better than the last film, Alien V.S. Predator.I thought this film was a little bit better than the first AVP, but I'd say this film would defiantly be best enough for it to be one of the epic sci-fi horror creature features.Like I said, the special effects were great, but the actors were under-rated. I mean, I know they continue the series showing what happens after the first AVP, but I wanted to see the same protagonist at first.The directors who made this film should have thought twice about trying to make this nearly earn a ""Worst Film"" award. I wish they had more thinking in the film.There were a few errors I realized in the film:The deaths by the aliens and PredAlien were up too close (Meaning that the camera came up to close to the Alien's and Pred Alien's kills.)Acting is in between middle and below by the under rated actors.This wasn't the awesome, but the worst and best film in my opinion.Rating: between 6.5 and 7.5",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

515,rossiepearson,Alienated,6,17 February 2013,"After the crossover of 2 legendary franchises in the less than impressive Alien Vs Predator, along comes the sequel filled with guns blazing, gruesome kills and a mother daughter storyline, in other words its an attempted remake of James Camerons Alien sequel Aliens (1986). Throw in a Predator and a Predator with an Alien head and you've got Aliens Vs Predator Requiem.Following on from the ending of Alien Vs Predator we relive the final scene in which the Xenomorph Alien Embryo breaks out of a Predators chest on board the Predator ship. So after that happened we ended up with a part Alien part Predator beast that for some reason hates the Predators and love the Aliens, if that part confuses you you're not alone, anyway once the Predators realise something is wrong with their ship they try to find the problem and end up crashing in the woods and allowing the captured Facehuggers loose in the middle of the woods where they happen to stumble upon a father and son hunting.From there its typical Alien (well Alien 3, Resurrection, and Vs Predator) as the Xenomorphs breaks out of the chests of their victims and begin to spread, exactly where the Queen was born remains to be seen as there was only about 3 Facehuggers on board the ship and we end up with about 5 aliens? Then we see a Predator on Predators planet suiting up for battle then making his way to earth. Thats when we get the Riplet Nut storyline, sorry i mean a female soldier and her daughter, add to that a sheriff and an ex convict and his younger brother being friends and that brother having a crush on the local hotty whose boyfriend wants to kill him and you've basically got a mixture of a classic horror cast mixed with a modern Sci-Fi cast.These plot and cast holes aside, the action is impressive, the effects are decent as usual, and the half Alien half Predator design is pretty good considering its a mix of 2 sci-fi icons that could have gone terribly wrong. The hybrid monster is the highlight of the movie, involving a chilling scene in which it is alone in the baby ward in a hospital.The ending is a decent amount of action and CGI but one you can see coming a mile off when Predator and Hybrid kill each other. Other than that its a decent action Sci-Fi movie, well until you get to the bizarre and unexplained ending, perhaps trying to set up AVP3 but that remains to be seen.Best Quote:Dallas:""Get to the chopper!""If you enjoyed watching:...Aliens, Alien Vs Predator...You'll enjoy watching Aliens Vs Predator Requiem",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
516,codecow,Solid alien vs predator movie,7,18 March 2021,Not the best nor the worst of the alien vs predator movies. Quite forgettable but entertains the entire run time. This movie gets unfair flak IMHO.,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
517,Biffe,Finally! It was about time!,9,18 January 2008,"This time the PG13-crew took a break and let the real film-makers do they thing! This movie is exactly what Alien and Predator is all about! These species don't care about the fragile minds of conservative Americans, neither do they care if you are 2 years old or 80 years of age. They don't care if you are pregnant and they don't care if you are pretty, blond and have a nice butt! The point is that we don't matter in this fight and neither does all the laws of the big movie-companies and the ratings that makes sure that little kids should be able to watch a movie which is clearly not meant for them.Many have said that this movie is predictable. They are wrong! This movie obeys the laws of the Aliens and the Predators, not the laws of sequels and money-hungry directors. All the people you think will make it so ""the boy can get the girl"" and the big, tough GI-Joe can save the day, dies! They are worthless in this fight and so are the rest of humanity. Let's face it: This is exactly how it would go down if this were to happen in real life.In a ""man to monster"" fight, we are a pathetic species compared to these creatures and that is all this movie is about. This movie is not about movie-stars or ""we are the world"", neither does the ""home of the brave"" save the world as they always do. We are just little ants in they way of a stronger race and they step on us if we get in their path. Finally! This time they stick to the story, not the boastful egos of those who are watching and wait for Captein America to come and save the day.Humans do not matter here, unlike the terrible and ridiculous ending of AVP, where a human is respected by the Predators for being ""brave"". Let's face it, we are very insignificant in the bigger picture, all though many people don't like do admit it. This movie has very few, if not zero, clichés and all the standard BS that these movies usually contain, is taken away, probably just to make a point about the fact that Hollywood need to start taking the Alien/Predator-audience serious. That does not mean that this movie is worthy of an Oscar or should be placed on the same level of film-making as Lord of The Rings and The Godfather. It just means that this sequel is very good as a Sci-fi/Predator/Alien-movie and that the director take the genre and the fans serious when it comes to what the audience want and expect. Movies like this will never be taken serious on an academic level and many people will probably laugh at my attempt to do so, but the fact is that these movies deserves just as much to be in the ""movie-universe"" as any other films and when I decide to see one (since I like these movies), I expect the director to not waist my time.So, I am not comparing AVPR to LOTR, I am comparing AVPR to every other movie in this genre and there are rules to be followed and a limit to how ridiculous even a Sci-fi movie can get. This movie on the other hand, stays within these limits and they simply put Aliens and a Predator on earth in a populated town, let them do their thing and hell breaks loose! Nothing more or nothing less! This movie is made for those who want to watch Alien vs Predator, not those who want to see an educational and romantic movie with a moral and a happy ending that stays within the taboos of our society. Let's face it, people: Aliens and Predators do not care for many peoples frail needs and dependence of government censorship. These monsters do what they do, no matter what you think of it. So... let me tell you, if the fundamentaly raw and violent world of Alien Vs Predator is what you want, then that is exactly what you will get! If you don't like that, stay at home and do something else. Enjoy!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
518,bradythatepicbro,Aliens Vs Predator Requiem movie review!,2,24 December 2013,Aliens Vs Predator was released in 2004 and was fairly disappointing and just because the film made money 20th Century Fox just had to hire visual effect designers to direct the sequel!Aliens Vs Predator Requiem is terrible. I Know it isn't a good way to start a review but this film is absolute garbage. The first film compared to this one looks like Aliens. As i said in the intro of the review the film was directed by visual FX designers and they have no vision and no talent whatsoever. Once the film started i had a feeling that i could just have silly fun with it like in the first film but in the movie the action scenes are so poorly lighten and you can barely tell what is going on most of the time. The thing that purely ruined this movie was the red band trailer literally showed all of the action scenes in the film. That's right one trailer showed all of the action scenes and the ending. Well these directors know how to market a film. Overall AVP:R is a disgrace to the Alien and Predator franchises and it makes me angry,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
519,steven-marshall99,"Good action/Slasher film, exactly what I wanted",8,20 January 2008,"Firstly its much better than AVP and doesn't let up on the action. This time as well we don't get a dumb ending.The predator (Ian Whyte) in this film was awesome. He was portrayed as a hard as nails Predator much like in the first two Predator movies. The way he dispatched Aliens 2 or 3 at a time was exactly the Predator I wanted to see.The Predalien was interesting, I still prefer the Predator and found the Predalien to be just an advanced Alien. But looked cool as hell.The acting wasn't that bad in the film, some of the script wasn't that great but who cares, I don't go see a film like this to watch good performances I wanted Gore and action and i got it. Spekaing of the gore , I realised that some of the gore shots were missing so i can happily smile knowing there will be an unrated version on DVD. :D I think this one was more for the Predator fans which suits my down to the ground.I hope to god they make a third one but maybe this time set it in the future and give it more of a story. Guess it'd have to be predator vs Queen Predalien in the next one, lol.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
520,yves-30,I could have done something else for 2 hours,5,8 February 2008,"Really average slasher movie with a lot of repeats of effects seen in earlier, better Alien and Predator movies.It feels like it is done by a director with very little imagination. It brings nothing new to the franchise and it is mostly a waste of time. Half way through the movie and most characters still don't relate to the Aliens or Predator except as victims. Who cares about Joe-schmoe who will be done with in 20 minutes and had absolutely no link to anything.I enjoyed the first Alien vs Predator very much. It had a story. This movie has none.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

But now, I honestly would rate the movie a little higher if the lighting wasn't so bad throughout the entire movie. Like I mean it's BAADD.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
522,Starhero999,The first one was great this one is just a piece of junk,2,30 December 2015,Like I said in the summary the original was at least exciting and decent but Requiem does little to entertain minor spoiler: the entire plot is after the events of the original film the predator ship lands in a small town the alien escapes and they battle it out while the town gets torn to shreds. Now if that doesn't sound bad enough the start of the film is a father son and dog go out hunting till they stumble across the ship that the alien escapes from and kills them right away then the alien and the surviving predator go around the town trying to kill each other but ultimately kill majority of the population of the town. I mean it does sound promising but it is horrible. Rental at best or watch on TV otherwise not worth the 94 minute runtime.,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
523,Unholyxxxx,What just happened?,2,26 August 2008,"I wonder how much this has cost. Sure it's no Titanic or something, but I think at least a few million dollars were spent on this flick. So wasn't it a complete waste of money to make this movie so dark that sometimes you don't even see what the hell is happening? I mean, I understand that a movie like this should take place in the dark, but this was ridiculous. The other Alien movies where dark too, but at least you could always see what's happening, or just enough...Damn, they should have stopped at Resurrection. Alien was one of the few franchises that maintained a certain quality, even after 3 sequels. As an Alien/Predator fan, I could live with the first AVP, it was cool to finally see the 2 species fight each other and at times it was thrilling. This 2nd AVP was a complete disaster, not one likable character, too little light and a story that couldn't keep a 5 year old kid interested for 1,5 hours.My advise, play the PC video games! Especially the first AVP game is still one of the best games I ever played, and it's a 1000 x scarier than AVP and AVP: Requiem combined, believe me!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
524,HerMrBubbles,You have GOT to be kidding,1,23 December 2009,I looked forward to this movie because of the Pred-Alien alone...now the way this movie turned out...was pure and utter friggin crap. The action and movie went ENTIRELY too quickly. I am a huge fan of both series of the creatures in this movie as well as a fan of the comic series by Dark Horse..and I know that the movie makers can do better than this! Come on guys! You let down so many fans of BOTH of these series! My biggest beef with ya is the fact that you killed a child on screen...to me that's going for a black list in my book. It's one of the reasons I stopped watching the movie Mimic and took it back to Blockbuster when it first came out on video tape. Just please if you plan on making another one...for the love of GOD please...talk to the fans first! Let's see if you can't get this series back to what it was! Action...violence...gore...and one HELLUVA story line. I don't like reviewing movies often but this movie literally struck a nerve that I can't just abandon because it's an insult to the series of both creatures. Granted Predator 2 and Alien 3 & Resurrection weren't the best in their respective series but they were Oscar winners compared to this! I got faith in you guys that you can do better so let's see what we can do for the next one shall we?,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
525,matthew19872004,aliens vs predator: requiem,10,4 January 2008,"well i have to say it looks a lot better. but hell i loved it. you know my kind of idea of an alien vs predator film would have to be when a tribe of predators decide to recruit some humans to help them destroy the aliens and then add a general alien as their leader as they spread out into the world and destroy everything insight and then have a few more battle scenes where one of the humans save one of the predators and then send a few of the humans with predator help to destroy the nest and have a showdown where the humans and predators manage to reach the nest and set off a bomb to destroy it. then when the general escapes, the elder predator have a last combat fight with each other in which the predator kills the general but ends up getting killed itself and dies. and then the predators give one of the humans a warriors token which is a sword and then take the elder predator with them and then blast off. and as the humans watch the ship lift off, they then just leave the area as the military go around killing off the rest of the eggs that were still safe and then finish off there. or if anyone has a better ending then please let me know.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

As usual with Hollywood there are story lines and characters that you really don't care about. However, it's all the more fun picking out those who will die first and those who are expendable. I mean with no big name stars, what more do you want? This treatment ends where the first Alien Vs Predator ends and delves into the world of the predators a bit more than previous stories, and has some pretty cool effects for those looking for some mindless action.

A very big contradiction in the story line.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
529,Joshy-3,"By the Numbers, Watch the Trailer Instead",2,25 December 2007,"I'm sorry to say that this movies was one of the biggest disappointments of the year. Following one of the biggest disappointments in movie monster match up history you would think that they would learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation. The sequel falls into many of the same traps, the plot line was completely forced, the dialog was so bad that the film might be better on mute, and the action was contrived and far from the heart pounding brilliance of each monsters original films. The best part of AVP-Requiem is in fact the trailer, which as you go through the movie end up realizing that almost every single death and every really cool shot in the movie was already shown in the trailer which leaves little to be revealed and little to be excited about. I gave the movie an extra star for letting see the extra hot female in the almost nude. the movie played out like a color-by-number sci-fi monster fest which also played into the fact that nothing was a surprise when it happened, because you'd seen it a thousand times before. the main failing with both these movies is that the creators thought that setting the films in our time would make us be interested in the story more as if it may one day happen to us. but what drew people in when they released the arcade game back in the day was that it kinda took place within an over the top futuristic version of the ALIEN trilogy time line which allowed more of a suspension of disbelief. this is where the future movies need to draw inspiration from. because to be honest, seeing a waitress killed by the ALIEN we all have feared since childhood just really doesn't do it for us. lets take the series back to its roots. learn from the former masters and don't mess with a winning formula by trying to make a 'bold new vision' we liked the originals for a reason, we want to see that again. Lastly, the ending is the real WTF moment of the whole film, *SPOILER* after the big climax, the survivors are ambushed by Special-Ops soldiers who justify their horrific actions by saying 'we were following orders' and then turn on a dime and start acting all nice and are turned into saviors. then after the long pull back with one of the survivors looking ominously into the heavens, we cut to the most bizarre cliffhanger I've ever seen, with characters you never saw in the rest of the movie (Save the Government Dude) then with all the subtlety of a punch to the face they reveal that there will be yet another film with the hint of a plot line that would make a sci-fi channel original movie blush and turn up its nose. So, in summation, if you have to choose between this movie and doing any other activity on the face of the Earth, skip the movie and do the other thing instead.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
530,MaNiC-6,Awful movie!,3,25 December 2007,"This wasn't sci-fi. It was old-school slasher! It had even less plot  and logic than any of the Friday the 13th movies. The aliens do what  they do and that's fine. But what is the Predator doing? He's just  killing everyone. In a very unsporting manner too I might add. A far  departure from the Predator directed by John McTiernan.  The scene in the hospital maternity ward alone was enough to boycott  this film forever. I don't think I'll look at childbirth the same way  ever again.  It may have been shot mostly in camera, but it's so darn dark you don't  know what's going on. It's not a credit to the filmmakers. And somehow,  even James Cameron's Aliens look better and they were filmed how many  years ago? 20 or so isn't it?",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
531,rachelalicehunter,**Spoilers*** AVP Requiem UNRATED is Excellent! Lots of Action!,9,19 April 2008,"***Spoiler Alert*** The theatrical release was horrible since they cut out all the great gore and violence. The Unrated version, about 17 minutes longer, is way, way better. Not in the category of Aliens but far better than Paul W.S. Anderson's horrible AVP. It's not 5 stars but a strong 4 stars. Reiko Aylesworth, the military mommy and Ripley heir-apparent does a pretty good job (not a Sigourney Weaver job but good). Ms. Aylesworth was in 24 (TV Series) and in the excellent Mr. Brooks (Kevin Costner as the serial killer).Even the title sequence with the Predator ship was cut from the theatrical release. The smaller ship that crashes to earth was docked at the big ship at the end of AVP. But, an alien was on board (Ripley's line in Aliens) in the chest of the Predator from AVP. I guess the Predator ""teenagers"" were going back to earth or somewhere to prove their worthiness to carry ""the mark"".The aliens grew too fast in AVP and the theatrical release of AVP-R but not here. It took some time. The dad and his kid, in the forest, woke up with them bursting out of their chests. Censored because of the kid I guess. And, the hospital was a breeding ground after a new alien mother used the women's unborn to make more aliens. Kinda sick but new.Kristen Hager (Jesse), the hot blonde, did say something stupid, ""The government doesn't lie to people."" Everyone looked at her like, ""Gee, what a bimbo!"" But, she was nice looking (for the guys in her lingerie).Anyway, after the crash and the ""Supreme"" Predator, I guess) finds out there's trouble, he heads to Earth to kill the aliens. He has some big fights with the Aliens, unlike in AVP or the theatrical release of AVP-R, and kills a few people in the process. He takes on two Predators at once even...watch the movie for the fun.The Colorado National Guard is slaughtered in less than 5 minutes by hordes of Aliens. Guess the Colonial Marines (led by Micheal Biehn in Aliens) weren't around yet. But, Reiko Aylesworth had some training I guess since she's takes over, drives the APC, and flies the helicopter. She also whacks a bunch of aliens.Some errors: Having a Dallas (The name of the Capt. of the ship in Alien) was strange. The Predator's gun that blasts Aliens to pieces was taken but not given to Weyland Industries but a Japanese concern. I doubt the Army would allow a Colonel, or a General, to do that. It does explain Yutani's involvement with Weyland Industries in Aliens. In the end, why isn't Reiko Aylesworth the only one still standing (add her child) like all the other Alien flicks? I personally thought Alien: Resurrection was fun just to see Jean-Pierre Jeunet make it and the great Winona Ryder as the ""artificial person"" (just for Bishop's feelings--Aliens) replacing Bishop (Lance Henricksen).Nevertheless, The Predator in this flick would give Gov. Terminator a run for his money rather than the ""teenager"" Predator he fought. But, why send just one Predator? I guess he was tough enough. The unrated version is excellent to watch just to have fun. I guess there are monsters after all.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
532,acavina,Massive Pros and Cons,7,13 April 2008,"I actually really enjoyed this film, much more then the first one. They certainly fixed the biggest issues the first film had; 'more Alien vs Predator-ing', more gore, bigger body count. But they sadly left the rest of the film crumble away.First off, the cons: -There were several unusual continuity errors and factual errors scattered through out the film; such as when the main character's brother is impaled through the chest by the Predalien, then he simply walks it off.-The main characters were very uninteresting and dropped like flies.-The story was absent from the film.-The movie was too short.But the pros of the film: -The action was much better then the first film, perhaps just as gory as the previous Alien and Predator films.-Both of the monsters looked better than ever.-Was very exciting many times throughout the film.-And lastly left a good opening for the 3rd Aliens vs Predator movie. Which will hopefully be set in space like the original franchise.So, the film seemed very rushed through production and B movie-ish at times, mainly due to its poor story and plastic characters, but was still very true to the heart of the AvP franchise with it's raw brutality and cold-natured monsters. An improvement over the first film in every way, besides story and characters, but not as legendary as the original series it spawned from. Hopefully, Aliens vs Predator 3 will be the savior.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
533,frankcontreras4,Fun as hell! WAY better than the previous one!,10,2 March 2008,"I gave it 10 stars just because people are being haters. While not the best (the original ""ALIEN"" and the original ""PREDATOR"" have those titles), it's still not only better than the first AVP film, but the best sequel in either franchise. It totally reminded me of the old-school monster movies I grew up on. Small town, dozens of monsters fighting against one monster, rain, cool deaths, plenty of blood, cool action sequences, the hybrid ""PredAlien""-what more could you ask for? I wasn't bored for a minute. The ending wasn't that great, but still good enough. My only complaints were the CGI (but not over the top like most movies nowadays) and the cliché'd ""jock"" character. But overall, very enjoyable and pleasantly surprised.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
534,brislev,"Awesome, simple as that",10,26 December 2007,"I waited with baited breath for AvP 1 and although I enjoyed it, left a fair bit disappointed. I have waited for this one all year and wow, what a movie. This could be interpreted as a direct rip off of Aliens, with brief moments of Alien3 and Alien resurrection, or paying homage to the classics that came before it. I say Aliens in particular, as you will see when you watch it. It also has the feel of the original Predator, right down the original music. If you want a bad arse predator back, not one that teams up with people!! and relentless, murderous, hard core aliens swarming the town, this is the movie for you. This left me wanting more.

After that, if you can sit through all of the garbage in between... the next really good part is when the end credits come up and you can go smoke or whatever you have been wasting 90 minutes of your life waiting to do.In truth, my wife and I decided that our $1.50/person at the dollar theater wasn't a total waste because it gave us something to complain about on the way home.There truly is no comparison for this movie. It is non-stop violence for the sake of violence.But by the time you read this, you already know all that because you have probably read the other reviews. I am actually writing to correct someone's list of plot holes.Someone was kind enough to point out everything that they deemed to be a breach of common sense on part of predator (quite a long list) and site them as plot holes. I found this strange and for this reason I was inclined to add my voice.For there to be plot holes, there has to be a plot. Here is the plot. AHHH... aliens are here. AHHH a predator is here. AHH everyone is dying... AHHH everyone is dead.That having been said... not much space for holes. A plot hole (in my book) would be places where information conveyed contradicts previous information... or where there is insufficient information to understand what is happening. As this movie contained no information at all, there was no entry point for confusion.In my view... it would be nice if the predator had survived the nuclear blast at the end... and began targeting the people in the credits.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
536,donstuie,Requiem is an appropriate name,1,4 January 2008,"Against my own better judgment I went to see this film today, and God I wish I hadn't. Awful. The first AvP film looks like a classic compared to this, it's THAT bad. These guys actually make Paul WS Anderson look like a master storyteller. In fact, this is what I'd expect an Alien and/or Predator film to look like if it was made by Uwe Boll! This movie actually offended me, and Lord only knows what would transpire if Ridley Scott or HR Giger were ever forced to watch this piece of crap. I can't understand how any fan of either franchise could like this film.Truly I don't know where to begin. I mean, the first AvP was poop, but it at least a semi-interesting story and setting, and occasionally some genuine tension. It didn't take itself overly seriously and it could at least be semi enjoyed on a purely ""leave your brain at home"" basis. But this one, it felt to me as though the people behind it thought they were making the next horror masterpiece. One after the other was a contrived 'suspenseful' scene in a dark room or corridor with creepy music playing, essentially bashing you over the head saying ""be scared NOW"". As James Cameron once said, you can't be told to be scared, you can only have your own senses heightened. The guys that made this film obviously weren't paying attention because they tried everything in the book to force you to be scared rather than letting you come to that level yourself. It's a cliché for internet nerds to say ""God, I was so bored from this movie and felt like leaving"", well this is exactly how I felt, even in the middle of the action scenes. They took this film totally seriously, which removed any possibility of enjoyment. Even the gag about how governments don't lie to their people was played without a hint of irony.As for the characters, I knew going in that the human characters were going to be completely pointless to this film but seriously if they're going to be on-screen at least have them doing SOMETHING that is relevant to the story. I don't care about this guy being beaten up by his dreamgirl's boyfriend, I don't care about the mother who's ""own daughter doesn't even know her, boo-hoo!"" (a pair of night-vision goggles for a present? Give me a break!) or the released criminal just trying to make a decent living and set an example for his brother, what a guy. Hell, even the obligatory hot-chick-in-panties moment was more contrived than usual. I get the feeling they expected the audience to be so shocked at the ending, as well as seeing chestbursters come out of kids, expectant mothers being raped and the like, that that would make up for everything. I don't think so.Then we move onto the stars of the film, and again very little to write home about. Were the aliens well-designed? I wouldn't have a clue because you can never see the damn things. All you see is one of a mouth, a head, a tail or a really dodgy cg outline climbing a wall, and barely enough to actually process that it is in fact an alien before Mr ""I cut Marilyn Manson and NIN music videos, think I'll do the same thing here"" Editor goes at it with the slice tool. Also, notice how hack action directors always set their films at night and in the rain? Hmmmm. The Predator could've been fighting giant sea monkeys for all we knew! Yes, the Predator was more impressive this time around, and I did think some of the new weaponry was cool, but that was about it. Also, since when does a Predator sound like a dinosaur from The Lost World? There were a couple of things that I kinda liked though. One was the use of sound effects and music from the original films (I also giggled a little bit at ""Get to the chopper!""), although other references were stupid (The main character's name being Dallas, give me a break). I also liked the visual FX for the Predator's vision, as well as how the hybrid alien looked (certainly beat the one from Resurrection). But really, those are the only positive things.Overall I found this movie inane, pointless, insulting and above all else offensive to the vision of the original creators of both creatures. That they've left the door open for another one leaves me almost depressed.If they had any decency they'd remove Dan O'Bannon, Ron Schusett and HR Giger from the credits of this film. They've done nothing to deserve this.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
537,night_wng,"Does contain spoilers: don't read, unless you wish to avoid wasting money",2,27 December 2007,"I'm very disappointed in the final product. Any $$ this film earns, is because it rides the reputation of 3 series (Alien, Predator, and AVP). There are so many things wrong with this film. The action itself was decent and enjoyable. But, as others have commented, the acting sucks. I believe this goes to the script, not the actors. I liked Reiko Aylesworth in 24. And she looked OK at times in this, but I don't think she had much to work with, due to bad writing. And that's a shame, since both credited writers have been involved with the entire Alien series.What action there was, I did like. The fight scenes were good, but too few and too short. To me, it seemed at least 1/2 the film was like watching a boring daytime soap, that was made worse by horrible acting, bad directing, and a lousy script. We know how and why one alien species is here, from the Alien series. But, I still don't know why the predator species is here (maybe it was explained in the predator series, but I don't remember). It would not only put more context to the AVP series, but the Predator films as well. All I could get out of this particular story, was that 1 predator came to avenge the one that was killed in the 1st AVP. But, that was twisted again, when it showed him taking steps to eliminate the ""host"" bodies for the other aliens. That would mean the predator species knew the other; knew their reproduction process/cycle; and how to track them, and how to prevent the spread of more of that species. Of course, those questions might be answered in AVP 3 (I have no doubt a 3rd will come). I was also confused with the sequence of certain events, and the lack of some. I watched the deputy call for the sheriff, when he was in the sewers, attempting to vacate the homeless dwellers, and learned of a possible death. I never saw any further police presence at that location. And why were the same homeless people in the same place, after one of them was with the deputy earlier, and knew of the danger? The sheriff seemed to be looking into the absence of the father/son, who were missing. Yet, he never showed up or talked with his deputy, about the incident in the sewer. Why was the FBI never notified about the missing people? Yes, I know this was a movie, and maybe I'm picking at more than I normally would. But, those points are more commonly found in ""B"" movies, than a highly anticipated, mainstream release. There are many ""B"" movies that I would rate better quality than AVP 2. An example of the poor script, is the obvious inconsistencies, not only from real life, but also that totally disregard previous movies in these series. First of all, the govt. has had full knowledge of the Aliens, for years. That is the most obvious fact. Second, 2 alien ships entered the atmosphere, and landed. While the 2nd may used cloaking technology, the 1st craft could not, since it crashed. Every nation with access to satellite or radar coverage would have been all over the crash site within an hour. Either that, or there would have been an immediate bombing, to prevent any aliens. Third, although it showed things happening quickly, as the National Guard arrived, the film presented the troops as inept, incompetent, and totally untrained. That is proved, 1st, by having only 1 squadron show up, then again when the Lt. does nothing as his squad is slaughtered. Any idiot would know, that there would be a whole unit sent in. The unit commander would have a command post set up within a safe distance, to monitor the situation, as his troops investigated. However, even as it happened in the movie, whoever was in charge of the troops would be on his radio, communicating with someone in command. There were several instances that showed our govt. was aware of the situation (although there was never anything to show how they knew). It was inferred that they were planning to cover up the whole incident, along with any witnesses. That might explain the lack of troop strength sent. But, it is contradictory, because if that was the case, there would never have been any troops sent into the danger zone.Lastly, was the method used to contain the area; At one point in the film, I thought I heard some reference, that would indicate there was a nuclear power plant involved (after the blackout, someone mentioned something about a ""core"", and that they should evacuate the town). It seems to me a nuclear plant was involved, which would have been a way to explain to the world, why there was a nuclear explosion in a remote area. Yet, why was there never any other moment when someone mentioned it, or maybe a scene that depicted it shown? That lack of information keeps me confused on that point.I hope any further sequel(s) will have a higher quality of acting, directing, production, and most of all writing. STOP trying to milk a popular story. If you're going to put out a sequel, make sure it lives up to it's reputation, and that we get our money's worth! I will likely watch other sequels, but only when the DVD is priced under $5.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
538,nmheavy,literally dark,1,18 February 2013,"I loved AvP so I was really looking forward to this one, but was immensely disappointed. As one of the reviewers already said there is NO sense of dread or build up in tension. Everything just 'happens'. The action scenes are all shot in almost total darkness with just the occasional flicker of light to show whats happening. When the action does happen u never really know whats going on or who's winning. We never see any egg producing queen alien leaving no explanation for why there are so many aliens. Just a load of rubbish, the sort of thing that happens sometimes when a franchise gets so successful, people working on it think it will sell no matter how bad it is and don't put any effort into it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

So Disappointed,4,8 February 2008,"Well,what can i say?I am not a fan of the Alien and Predator series.And AvP i saw 3 years ago was much better than this,even though i never really care about the aliens,predators.When i saw this yesterday,i was disappointed.There was no suspense,scary scene,only gore.The movie had some scene against the children and the pregnant women.How can they only send one predator,how can the predators didn't know there was an alien in their ship?The storyline was stupid.the fight scene between Wolf and the Prdedalien was short.I liked the one in AvP.The acting was OK,so are the dialog,although they are still bad.I'm only 13 but i almost fell asleep while some high school students sit next to me were screaming.I enjoyed Avp,but in AvP:R, they have ruined it.If you are a fan of the series,do not watch this.If you just want to watch some monster movie,i suggest you to watch AvP,which was much much much better.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
540,talyseon,Milking the Franchises of Legends.,3,21 April 2008,"Alien Versus Predator: Requiem (2007) Directed by Greg and Colin Strause.Alien may be one of the best movies of all time. While Predator is not in that league, it is a first rate action film. Two great franchises, both of which have sparked the imagination of the public leading to many tie in products, particularly in the field of comics. Two great tastes that taste great together? Like Salmon and Butter Pecan Ice Cream.The premise is this: the Predator species are hunters. The Aliens make excellent prey, a challenging hunt. A Predator ship is transferring face huggers; one of the life stages of the Alien species, when one gets loose and infects a Predator. This Queen causes a crash on a primitive planet, Earth.A father and son are out hunting from a small town. Face huggers that survived the crash attack them, and soon, they are hosting Aliens with in them.The infection spreads quickly, especially because the Predator Born Alien Queen can inject young through her tongue, and each host gives birth to a litter.There are several side plots; a kid gets out of the slam, and has trouble fitting back in, a woman is home from the military, and has trouble fitting in, and who really cares? I'm not even going to bother crediting actors. There were no outstanding performances, either good or abysmal. I am sure that in years to come, these people will think of this movie as ""paying dues."" One of the scariest features about the original Alien was the fact that you never saw the monster complete until the very end. This movie does not bother with suspense. This is a standard monster munch fest. It is Critters with better monsters. Also highly effective in the original was the setting. The Nostromo was very dark, industrial and grimy. To simulate this a big chunk was shot in the sewers of this small town, and then the nuclear power plant. Partially effective in what they were shooting for, the entire movie suffered for a lack of lighting. In the Nostromo there were shadows. Here, there is darkness. I swear; it is difficult to make out what is going on in many of the scenes. It is not suspenseful, it's frustrating.The Monsters in this movie were great. The special effects were first rate. And that is all that was good. Alien and Predator both had effective dialogue. This is contrived movie cr/@p. It reads like a movie of the week.Another portion of the movie takes place in the woods, like Predator in the jungle. The cover is not deep enough to build the suspense like it did in the original. Once again, trying to copy a Masterpiece, and pulling a knock off. Further, the sheriff and the military mom, and the boys with hunting experience all arm themselves, and this echoes both Predator, and Aliens. But it is not a mercenary unit. We are not impressed that the monsters can disassemble this band of stone cold killers, instead, we are secretly hoping they will, and soon. Again, the flawed Xerox.I have tried to be objective about this; sometimes it is easy to bash a sequel that did not live up to its original. I personally thought all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies were good, but suffered because the first one was Great.And I have to admit, that had I lived in the Amazon Rainforest all my life, and this was the first horror movie I ever saw, it would impress me. But following in the wake of, and mooching off the corpses of two great movies, I tend to grade it more harshly. This could have been better, much better, and without much effort.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
541,snakei3000,i feel happy and unhappy about the movie,7,18 April 2008,the characters in this movie were not interesting at least in avp 1 the did have a good story containing the alien predator mythology but this film really just focus on the humans escaping and just getting in the way from the battle in a way there wasn't enough screen time for good characters and the whole town escaping backlot just didn't seem real and it reminded me of predators and aliens in a resident evil movie and all they needed to do was to add zombies hey it's got awesome gore but im a guy that also likes a good story this movie does not but if you like the noir and mythology behind the characters then it's a new alien and predator movie so it's worth it but i think the directors tried to do to much with it. it didn't need it,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

There was one (and only one) the special effects were great. The rest of the movie was utterly horrific & not in any intended way. The story was boring & something more like what you would find on one of Sci Fi's Saturday night movie of the week. The human characters were the worst part of it. Horrible! Honestly, a punk 20 something who just got out of jail for boosting cars? His douchebag loser pizza delivery brother, a whiny prom queen wannabe & some skinny assed chick who got back from pushing pencils in Iraq. PATHETIC!

Its like how is this guy even a director its just all black, its so easy to make a child with a video editor could just put a dark filter over home movies and BOOM you got AVP.No wonder the franchise went in the toilet with people like this director destroying the branding of the entire Predator and Aliens universe because they hate science fiction.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Don't listen to the posts of people on the boards. Go see it yourself and make your own judgements. I think it was a hell of a lot better than AVP 1 and I hope the Strauss brothers make the next one.

547,Andrewamphlett,"""R"" rating sequel after PG-13 film, AVP 2 is better than you might think!",7,23 June 2013,"Okay first off, I want to get straight to the point and say I enjoyed this sequel, for a number of good reasons. I feel that first one was very good with its production quality with set design, costume and make up, followed by some well-done C.G.I effects but it was trying too hard capture that Ripley, survivor girl. Sanaa Lathan (The Cleveland Show) was bad ass woman, which not bad thing but it's already been done with excellent Sc-fi Action flick ""Aliens"" but what AVP lost was that ""R"" rating tone, with creepy hallway shots, violence and just feels too friendly with Predator helping our survivor girl and it's like going from80's Predator to thatis huge! But to AVP 2: Requiem, there was lot of time and effort put this project, with watching the extras on special edition, I actually enjoyed the film a lot more every time with knowledge there was fans of both franchise wants to make a ""R"" rating film and give best of both worlds. The creature designs with the Predator's face to redesign Aliens, which is not C.G.I is awesome and the main Hybrid was interesting design from head to toe and pretty scary within key scenes. I can understand where people are coming from, when didn't enjoy this film. It's got the cheap slasher horror film feel with teens running the town, but lot of them just there to be kill off in very nasty ways, unlike first filmwhere the most was just off screens kills. But the fact it was everyday life with the cops, teens and other characters in the film, and it's like what the hell is going? From there point of viewpeople are going missing, weird things are happening throughout the film, it's avenge easy storyline YES! But with a bad ass hit-man Predator and Hybrid more than makes up for it.Overall the film is great in showing two of the best species going against one another, with very entertaining action scenes and especially the finale fight sequence, I feel was awesome. So if your fan of darker tone AVP film then give a chance, if not then stick first film (or best the original films).",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
548,philmarked,"Better than AVP, Not better then the rest.",4,4 January 2008,"The biggest complaint I have about AVPR is that you can hardly see anything for the entire movie! I would have liked to seen more of the Predalien and also more shots of the aliens themselves. In my opinion, they should have never ""mixed"" the 2 franchises. Predator is unique enough to hold a viewer, as are the aliens. My other complaint, is the constant plot twists that are extremely stupid. Poor character development is very apparent in this film. The Predalien was NOT shown enough! I hardly saw what he looked like half the time. I know the dark was for ""atmosphere"" but come on it was too dark! Acting was sub- standard, and unbelievable. It seemed to me that the actors had difficulty being ""scared"" of the aliens. The pregnant women exploding seemed strictly for shock value, and unnecessary. Last of all, why does Predator always kick aliens ass? I think that is totally unrealistic, especially with the huge amount of aliens in the film, not including the Predalien. If you have no expectations and someone pays for you, go see it. Oh yes, my favorite line ""The government doesn't lie to people"" HEHEHE whatever.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

It starts off right where the previous movie left off, a mutated hybrid of an alien and predator (prealien I guess)causes havoc and terror to an unsuspecting town in Colorado. Filled with it's fair share of plot holes and minor movie canon annoyances, I found myself actually kinda ticked off the way the Brothers Strause handled some of my favorite Sci-Fi characters. This flick is basically a slasher movie with E.T.'s thrown in, you could just as easily tossed in Zombies or Freddy Kruger and it would have been virtually the same movie. Some of the problem was I just didn't care about the characters, In the Alien movies, Ellen Ripley was a character you cared about, you wanted to see her live and win, In Predator, you wanted to see Arnold kick ass and walk out at the end with one of his world famous cheese lines. In this film I wanted to see everyone die. The end of the movie brings a slight ( and I emphasize slight,) plot twist that explains an unanswered question or two.

Two of the most iconic sci fi creations to come out of Hollywood and he decides to place them in an episode of the OC. Why should we care about the ridiculous romantic sub plots and and lame teenage drama! I don't give a dam about the human relationships. They have absolutely no bearing on the plot!The original movies, both Predator and Alien (and following Alien films) derived their tension from claustrophobic environments, and a small cast. It works. Hear that Hollywood? For this reason, among others, Predator 2 was not as good as the original. The first AvP film at least deserves some credit for realising this. In fact it's a masterpiece compared to this. As one reviewer already pointed out, this a business venture, nothing more. Even if they had ripped off the plot from AvP2 the PC game it would have made a far better movie. A movie of this poor quality doesn't deserve much of a review, and other reviewers have already detailed its many failings, pretty much all of which I would agree with.Until they are prepared to make a no compromise, balls out film, slap an 18 certificate (r)and hand it to a director with a genuine passion for sci fi movies then please don't make any more.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

However, this film is quite entertaining if you go into the theater just wanting to be entertained by a pointless film for an hour and a half.

Nowhere near Predator,Predator2,Alien,Aliens,Alien³.Even Alien4 was better i think.I gave it a 6/10 back in 2004,and i was generous. then we heard rumors about a Predator 3 so i was excited to see it!Then they did not make it,instead they did an AVP-R.So i was very disappointed because i did not like the first AVP movie,but i was hoping for a better VS movie at least.What i got was a movie with some good action,but bad director/writer/producer/actors made this movie lot worst that it could have been.I had fun,its a little too dark,maybe they fixed this in the DVD i don't know,but the main problem of this movie is:actor badly directed,story weak(bad writer),actor not good at all(or the fact that they are badly directed),no likable character,but great looking predator,much better than AVP predators.They restored that in AVP-R,at least thats a start.They need the punch of the late 80's early 90's director/writerThe movie itself has action,gore,violence but has not the magic,script ,decent directing and likable character that made Predator and Aliens so good(which i both gave 10/10)With a decent director like(James Cameron,John Mctierman,Paul Verhoeven) im sure the movie would be a lot better,but they did not want to pay!So i will say that its better than AVP (for the action),the acting was better in AVP.but i still end up giving AVP 4/10 AVP-R 7/10If you want a movie that kick some butts watch RAMBO 4 that is a 10/10NOW ITS TIME FOR A PREDATOR 3 with decent director/writer/actorsexample: old school:James Cameron,John Mctierman,Paul Verhoeven maybe even Stallone to direct the movie!He is a decent writer/director and he proved that in Rambo 4 and he was the writer of Rambo and Rocky movies!2000's new talent:Zach Snyder,Robert Rodriguez,All we need now is a Predator 3,maybe after they could make avp3 but,all the fans want Predator 3 or Alien 5 ,even on the AVP-R boards,we all want Predator 3,not avp3,Hollywood should ask us to help them to make a Predator 3!come and talk to us on the AVP-R board if you want to know what real fans want!(voted a 9 because the rating is a little low)but my rating is 7/10",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
556,borg2004,Please no more acid,2,18 February 2008,"The latest film in the predator - alien realm was a great disappointment and i felt that the sum of the two franchises is weaker than its parts. I realize now that it was unfortunate to join the two milieus without having any insight story-wise beforehand.Although the previous film had some steady performances and the use of the creatures was more measured and therefore more enticing, this one goes off to showing rampant slaughter in its entirety.Both franchises had exhibited some engaging aspect of science fiction in the past but in this film no mystery or awe just kill after kill on all hands. Whereas the predator seems to have some coda for his actions the alien is just your monster of the week. In the past films, the protagonist had some sort of relationship to the creatures (ripley, Arnie , Danny glover's character) but in this one it's like the sheep and the wolves. Where is the fun in that? Turning the villains into heroes was the worst choice possible.This is not what it was supposed to be about in the first place, it was primarily about humans and the mystery the creatures represented.Now it's freddy vs jason.This might work for comic books not feature films...Are studios so desperate for cash that they 'll butcher (pun intended) anything including once reliable properties ? Very sorry i saw it and i will definitely close the book on this for good.Please stop making them, seriously...",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
557,chaser_cz,"No plot, no action, no thrill... no *everything*",1,2 February 2008,"It's completely unbelievable that someone could actually shoot a movie that does not contain anything that makes a movie. There are no characters in the movie. I mean, there obviously are characters in the film, but their problem is they have no character at all. They are all plain dull dummies. They die and you fell no sorrow for them, neither you feel anger towards their killer. You just sit there watching aliens slaughtering the whole city including babies and pregnant women and all you feel is something like: ""Hey, that looked cool, maybe he could kill a few more this way"". Even more, mankind plays the role of food in this movie, just sitting and waiting to be killed by an alien, rarely trying to run and even more rarely trying to fight back, which results in a complete absence of thrill in this movie. How are you supposed to be worried about someone when you are pretty sure that they will just sit there, then maybe shout a little and then they will be just lying in one bloody mess with a huge hole in their skull? Underneath all this stupid and pointless slaying and murdering lies a plot, which is... even more stupid. The Predator is obviously sent to Earth to clean all the mess and destroy all evidence left by his predecessors - which he ultimately fails. He takes so much time to destroy this and that and after his hard job is done, he skins a cop and lets him hang on the tree so that others could find him. He doesn't even bother to collect his skull as a trophy, which I thought was his normal behavior. Maybe they sent quiet a stupid Predator to match the average population of the town, because the retarded population mentioned above would pose no serious challenge to a skilled man-hunter. Considering this all and many other flaws I don't even bother to mention, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only thing that made me watch it till the very end is that even under such circumstances, the Predator still looks pretty cool and shows us some great looking fight scenes. But even a dozen of mighty Predators would not be able to save this movie so - unless you are a hard-core alien or predator fan - don't waste your time and money on this movie!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
558,Lnarc,Average upon average,5,21 April 2008,"OK, usually I'm someone who enjoys mindless violent action films, but I seriously just could NOT get into this movie. It was so bland and so boring there was not one bit of this movie that scared me {aliens}, awed me with awesome violence {predator - mind a few scenes}, or made me feel anything for this movie. It was like the directors recreated the old movies and decided not to create any story, just that they wanted two bad-ass aliens to duke it out. As I said, I usually go for that, but AVPR just plain SUCKED. I wish they would have done more, such as focusing on the actual ALIEN confrontation of both races.For example, actually expanding the predator universe and revealing it's culture. Then this movie would have just done better without ANY humans whatsoever because everyone can agree most humans in with the mix of these two bad-ass aliens is either going to die or bore us, except Arnold of course. They could have at least made some likable human characters instead of the two-dimensional trash that many bad movies are plagued with. If they had focused more on the two alien races, their culture, and the battle in-between them I would have found this a lot more interesting and less dull. You could predict every single little thing and the only type of movie that comes from is slasher films, which are a bore as well.Either way, AVPR is just an average flick that might have done well if it had been in line first before all the other films of each franchise. Other than that, there's nothing worth watching unless you are some slasher film fan.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

They say the special effects were bad,they were decent and the acting wasn't that bad. The action scenes were awesome. Its the gory movie people were hoping for in the original. Its not as good as the original alien and predator movie but it wasn't meant to be.

They went TOO FAR with the birthing room scenes! In fact, even the idea is SICK!!! If they had to put it in at all costs, there are still simple filmmaking solutions with which you just imply things and don't PUSH into the face of the people in complete fullness!

A warning to whoever goes out to the cinema to see a good movie and ends up watching this film, it is without a doubt the worst of any alien or predator or alien vs. predator film made thus far. it has lost all of the atmosphere it once had and the acting has followed in the same trend. the plot also left a lot to be desired. this movie is under the genre horror/action in my books and yet it fails to be either. The movie is so badly made it just cant scare you, it is far too predictable. and the action has no effect on you what so ever, the fight scenes are made up of around a billion mili-second frames showing you black figures flailing around madly bearly resembling any kind of fight apart from the occasional spurt of green yellow acid.so without a doubt this is a truly terrible film, i advise all of you out there not to see it. you will only be disappointed.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

564,goothva1,Only if you are ***extremely*** bored.,1,30 May 2009,"After having watched the first 15 minutes of the film, I can honestly say that this movie is full of plot holes. You would think that for the budget they would have at least hired someone to write a decent script. I am not saying anything about the bad acting that (so far) is very prominent, but you can only do so much when idiots are running the show. If you've seen the first Alien movie, then it should be apparent that the gestation period of the embryo is much longer than what this movie shows. Case in point would be the predalien that hatched on the ship, and then grew to full size before they even left orbit?? WTF is that all about? It appears to me that they attempted to make this movie somewhat of a thriller, with a little bit of drama mixed in. As of now, being 25 minutes into the movie, I am seriously loosing interest in it, very fast. I honestly don't expect myself to watch the whole thing, but you never know. I would say go ahead and watch this movie, only if you have absolutely nothing else to do. But, that's just my take on it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
565,alphy,"Don't watch this, or at least don't pay for it.",1,28 December 2007,"Today I saw AvPR. And I saw a man that hand-farted the ""Sweet child of mine"" by Guns'n Roses. I am not going to exaggerate by saying that hand-farting man was better than the newest Alien/Predator movie. No. I want to be fair. Both things were quite equal. Only the guy was suppose to be funny.After P. Anderson's AvP I really wanted Fox to finally give up their quest to destroy one of the best franchise in cinema history. It's been obvious to, me for some time, that they don't care for it at all. Why? There are at least 3 answers: Alien: Resurrection, AvP and... AvPR. I know some people would add Alien 3 as well. Among these 3 movies Alien:Resurrection shines as a beautiful star. And I have to say, it was still pretty bad. That being said, it is clear that all the studio wants is to suck the idea/ideas dry, leaving an empty shells of what once was great stories. For them, money is the ONLY thing that counts. After exploiting that, they move on to ruin some more stuff.That's the only explanation for AvPR being made. The movie was suppose to be better than AvP. Both directors seemed very confident about their work in progress. Fans were being fed the news, trailers, etc. And yeah. One could think: ""It HAS TO be better. What can be worse than AvP? Right?"" WRONG!!Like I said at the beginning. This movie can be easily compared to hand-farting guy. Some things in the movie are better. I mean, SFX for example, but since hand-farting guy movie doesn't have any SFX (excluding the farting), it's not a big deal. Major downer is, that the AvPR is a lot longer, thus making us suffer longer. I have a habit of watching the movies to the end. No matter how bad they are. Becose I want to have a full picture and accidentally don't miss out a great ending or something (hey, it may happen sometimes). This movie is REALLY bad. I know saying this does not have a proper impact, since plenty of people said it already. But they're right. The movie is AWFUL. I hated the first AvP and really was hoping to see something a lot better. Instead, I got pretty much the same thing. Sometimes, even worse. I am not going to name all the things that make this movie suck so much because it's not worth my time. And there are dozens of them, maybe even hundreds. The movie is boring beyond the belief, there is ABSOLUTELY no tension. It's not interesting at all. One cannot care less for what happens next. The script must have been really bad, but the directors pushed it even further. They didn't know what they were doing, unfortunately. For (just one out of MANY) example: someone, please, tell me what the hell is with predator almost always making an entrance with a big thump, jumping from something. It may be OK ONCE. I counted like 6 or 7 times!! I slapped my forehead after the third one (and at least dozen times more throughout the movie). And I didn't believe anyone would lack, not only creativity, but just common sense to do that yet again. But they managed to prove me wrong. They proved me wrong a lot times in this movie, for that matter. AvPR seems like being made by a 10-year-old for 10-year-olds. And I am not exaggerating one bit. This proves that absolutely ANYONE can direct nowadays. Even big studio movies with a certain budget, not home-made videos. Basically everything suffers here. Boring plot (with plenty huge holes in it), awful script, horrendous acting, and last but not least, one of the worst directing. And I'm not just saying that to bust balls. We got a teenage drama (Dawson's Creek, and other similar stuff) poorly mixed with rambo-like feel. No horror or thrill whatsoever. Adding the music or lines from previous films, that was suppose to prey on the impact that they had on the audience, instead of making you feel something positive (that's already been coded into your subconscious by previous movies) it makes you realize that they're butchering the classics before your very eyes. I say that again, because I really mean it. This film seems like it was made by 10-year-olds for 10-year-olds (who may enjoy it, actually). Not trying to offend anyone here, but so it happens, that 10-year-olds usually don't have any taste and seeing some monsters fighting is enough for them to have a major blast.One can go on and on and on and on about how bad this movie really is and about dozens truly idiotic things in it, but it's a waste of time. I only spent some of mine to write this review, because I want to ask everyone that read it a favor. Please!! For your own good!! Don't watch this movie!! Or at least, DON'T PAY FOR IT! If the profits are the only thing that people responsible for allowing such movie being made understand, than let this movie be a financial disaster, so they think twice before allowing the next garbage like this to be produced.

566,pmaglinger,Where's the suspense?,1,29 December 2007,"This entry doesn't contain a spoiler. It doesn't have to. The movie is as predictable as the sunrise. The element in the first Alien movies was the suspense that something COULD happen. This was so in the first two Predator movies, though less prevalent. Requiem has totally removed the element of suspense and replaced it with blood and gore. You know people are going to die (well duh, it is a AvsP movie), but you know WHO is going to die and WHEN they are going to die, AND WHERE they are going to die before it happens. The directors should take a lesson from Hitchcock who said, ""Suspense is not a time bomb going off under a table. Suspense is a bomb NOT going off under the table"". What's the sense in going to a movie when you know exactly what is going to happen and when? If you really, really want to watch this movie, wait until it comes out on video and then RENT IT, but by no means would I ever buy it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
567,Nemeszisz,Requiem for the Alien Series,3,5 February 2008,"I was only fourteen when I first saw the Alien movies and I immediately came to like it. Original, terrifying and classic. Sigourney Weaver was the perfect choice for the female hero character and she would have deserved a statuette for her act. In 1979 something everlasting was born than the immortal series continued with a nothing less legendary movie than the first. Alien3 was a different point of view but I think this part was the most stressful and unique of all, this was my favourite. Unfortunately the last one was a failure in many ways. It was strained, illogical with full of meaningless massacres. I didn't like it at all, but I never thought that a worse part would ever be made in the future. Well as it turned out in 2004 I was wrong. Alien vs. Predator was a bad break, and it should have been directed by a more talented director or should have never been made at all. But when I saw Alien vs Predator Requiem I was totally shocked moreover devastated. When I sat down and decided to watch it with full of doubt, even than I had never thought that such a bad movie could be made. Without a screenplay, without a director and without actors I don't understand how can a film be made. Because this film misses these three terms. What you get is a nice massacre show without a story but with a lot of annoying and boring dialogues. Waste of money and waste of time.

570,nimiac,My review is more entertaining,4,8 July 2008,"I would agree that this film is not as poor of a feature as Leprechan in the Hood or Jason Takes Manhattan, but it is offensive to see on account of the fact that it is a sequel to a spin-off of two former franchises that were far superior. The worst of Alien 4 and Predator 2 combined outweigh the best of both Alien Vs. Predator movies (combined as well). The main thing that is wrong with this film is that it exists to begin with. It is, at its core, a popcorn flick, and there's nothing wrong with that, but it is just a typical, formulaic romp through the park for Fox, a studio that has become more and more notorious for taking the proverbial lemon that is a franchise and squeezing so much of the pulp out of it that by the time they get to the point that it's time for a spin-off sequel, all that is left of the lemon is the bitter rind. The bastard child that is the Predalien is a neat-o idea, but nothing more than that. It's still just an Alien with dreadlocks and an even more complicated jaw. Why do they do it? Money, and the prospect of future money. It's the same reason why The Simpsons are still going, and likely will continue to be for another five years, and the same reason why there will be another Alien Vs. Predator movie. Someday, when we're all a bit older, there will be a boxed set for sale called something like ""The Alien Predator Saga,"" with nine or ten movies in it, and it will sell for over a hundred dollars and be jam-packed with extras, but only have three good movies in it, and the box-art will be more enticing than most of the discs. Meanwhile, Alien, Aliens, and Predator will all be down a few aisles in the sci-fi section packaged individually, each for sale for something between ten and twenty dollars. Why was this film so bad? The direction, script, production, set design, lighting, cinematography, and acting all paled in comparison to the three ""good"" movies of ""The Alien Predator Saga."" All this movie had going for it were permissible special effects and editing, but that's rarely enough to make a movie good. But let's be happy for Fox. The studio execs have a profitable movie on their hands, and that's the bottom line.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
571,poundapinthic,On earth you ain't got time to scream!!! (One small step.. in the right direction),6,7 February 2008,"I almost gave this film a far greater rating out of ten... mainly because of the trashing it has been given. However I felt that I had to be honest in my review or what was the point of it!? Once again I admit I got my hopes up for this film and once again I ignored my logic of listening to my heart and not my head! The unforgettable rule... excellent trailer, disappointing film. In my anticipation i must have watch the red band trailer several times and the official trailer just as many! The trailer was excellent! When I was younger, script and directing were very far down my list on a film, really it was all about the monster and the action! The thing this film hits on is the fantastic effects, the Predators are back to their basics and look the part as to the Aliens. I was dreading (no pun intended) the Pred-alien, worrying it would be a calamity of something like the new born in Alien Resurrection. I was very much pleased with the out come! Even the CGI looked pretty solid, possibly the odd point of obvious computer graphicary shone through but it is a very solid effort. If I was the age I were when I first saw predator or predator 2 (underage) I would of loved this one for a very long time indeed. This film I feel is more for that child in me that loved the imagination and the look of the creatures and the horror and power they would have on life if a part of reality.However the child in me seems to be a blood thirsty one, so he was very happy! Though I question how this was a 15 in the UK... and maybe slightly worried it was! This was a blood soaked death affair which you do need in an Alien or Predator film. Some very cool deaths indeed pulling no punches what-so-ever! I have to say though even I was shocked as a couple but hey I guess I'm getting old! If you're expecting... do not watch this film! ;) While this ticked my boxes on action and blood (double ticked on the blood) I realised that the that's all the budget seemed to be on. The dialogue and acting was terrible, I'd sunk in my chair with embarrassment! On a lighter note this did mean I was definitely routing for the monsters from another planet!!! At least the government of the film realised the acting was so poor they decided to take out the whole town! Another problem I found was the directing. Though the action sequences were very well done I found the dialogue scenes just didn't work, i feel this might be the fact of brothers were possibly fresh off directing music videos but the cutting of the character conversing was just poor!? (worse than the grammar in this review) The film was also a bit on the too dark side, which was a shame to fact we missed out on some of the brilliant special effects. Another problem I found was there was absolutely no suspense to this film! I didn't mind this too much, it takes you on a ride and keeps the action fast and pacey but I just wasn't scared or worried or nervous. I watched and love or hated! This got me thinking, this could be a film that was maybe trying too hard to please the fans who were let down by the original. Trying to please everyone by having as much key iconic moments in one film as possible. From a signature skinning to a tough chick in a tank!? It's good attempt, gory & fast paced, definitely a step in the right direction for effects and creating a broader scale. However the more I think about and dissect it, the more black holes I find. It was almost like they read my review on the first AVP and made the changes I complained about... but they ignored everything else that was fine with the last one! I think one reviewer put it best, awful film, excellent movie!!! Brain go in fridge for this one! Fanboy's should be satisfied with this one as it's like an inner child has created it. Film geeks however won't enjoy the trashy scale! I still want more though of this franchise because if it's been this bad it can only get better! Just needs work on the suspense and acting and the finer details... possibly a bit more soul! I'll end with an 'on my knees begging' to the film industry! In the next one can the main hero be played by Bill Paxton please!!! He's been killed by Aliens and decapitated by Predators, I'd think it would be brilliant he managed to survive them next time! Plus he can act! P.S. Was it me or did anyone notice that the predator skinned around the meat n two veg when we see the body being zipped up in the body bag???!!! Or am I just warped!?

572,anjelen,well...you like it or you do not.,7,6 February 2008,"And I liked it. At least the first half of the film. The first 45 min. were more in the perspective of the aliens and predator(s), with a little bit of social human drama. (they could have let that out). The next 45 minutes were more in the perspective of the humans (exept for the end) Now there are 2 kind of people who watch this movie:1: people who like the alien/predator franchise or just like movies with violence, monsters, sf etc.2: people who didn't read what the movie is about. (plain STUPID)So don't mind about the "" second"" people but listen to the "" first"" people if you are one of them and watch this one.

573,stevencartwright_556,It's time to blow the franchise out of the airlock!,2,28 January 2008,"Let me start by saying that this movie is not awful. It's just badly produced, directed and written! From start to finish there are no new concepts that add depth to the already visceral world that is the Alien/Predator franchise. H.R Giger and Stan Winston designed two of the most terrifying interstellar monsters in modern box office history and the writers gave both creations plenty of room to evolve. It is a real shame that more recent efforts have failed to take advantage of such solid roots.In the case of AVPR, all we see is a poor re-hash of existing ideas and a light smattering of new ones. This is most evidently seen in a scene where a Predator climbs up into a tree to mend his damaged arm; can't think where i've seen that before! In fact, the one new concoction, the Pred-Alien, is so lightly touched on that you can hardly distinguish it from the rest of the kin. There is also visit to the Predator home-world, which is nicely designed and possibly one the most memorable scenes in the whole film. Unfortunately, this intergalactic experience is as brief as the thought that went into the scriptwriting.The action scenes are OK, although quite often you can't really see what's going on and not in the stylish, claustrophobic manner of the earlier Alien films. There is certainly enough blood and guts to satisfy the gore-junkies amongst you, but if that is your only motivating factor for going to see this film, then i'm sure you'll be equally disappointed by the fairly unimaginative deaths (with the exception of one pre-natal nasty and an incident with a giant discus!).For me though, the real low-light of this film was the pathetic attempt to keep the franchise alive with a 'cliff-hanger' style finish. To a degree, this does point things in a direction that is in keeping with a sequence of events leading up to the first Alien film. However, this inevitable attempt to eek more pennies out of the cinema going public is both transparent and reeks of desperation. Please, please, please let this franchise slip into a peaceful slumber, before the brilliance of the early titles is completely diluted by the steady stream of utter crap that has followed.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
574,cnarla,Could be good for a laugh,1,26 December 2007,"I loved the Alien films and didn't mind the Predator films (preferred the second one) I didn't see the trailers apart from when at the films, looked interesting thought I would see what it was about.I could not have been more disappointed. There was the set up for the film dead predator, alien chest burster, hybrid alien predator okay I could buy all of that. Then we had the introduction of the humans in the story. Sorry but they were just there as food or breeders we really did not need to get to know them. The crook trying to go straight, the struggling trailer trash, who has the hots for the vacuous cheer leader who goes out with the abusive cowardly jock, the heroic returned soldier who has a poor relationship with her daughter because of her absence. Talk about stereotypes.Just as I was about to fall asleep somethings started to happen. The planet the Predator was on was cool, and when he saw the video of the attack on the ship and the crash it had a bit of an air of ""bugger now I have to go and clean up this mess"" I did get the impression this was a predator on a mission to clean up the mess the predators had made rather then to prove himself. He was there to get rid of the hybrid.Then we got stuck with the humans again (and yet another screaming girl didn't like it when Newt gave out that piercing scream either) The homage to Aliens, Ripley and Newt tends to stand out. The powerful female who will save the day, the screaming child. The ""rugged"" sidekick who will help her. I was waiting for someone to tell her she had ""blown the trans-axle and was just grinding metal"" (may not be an accurate quote) as so many of the lines seemed familiar.I started cheering when people got killed, quite liked the cheerleaders death, big thumbs up for that one.The clincher is of course the fact that the government will sacrifice people for the ""good of the nation"" Yes they may well do that and to make sure the aliens were in the right place send them in as bait. But in that case the only ones to survive who had seen the aliens (of all sorts) and even had an alien weapon would surely not have been allowed to live, maybe they were shot off screen.I went to see the predators and the aliens going up against each other, I don't think humans need to be involved (let's not go into the way the hybrid breeds that would have to be one of the quickest gestation times in history) and of course set on an alien world would make it even better.It may of just been me but the filming was so dark it was hard to see any of the action that did happen. I would of loved to watch the fight scene between the predator and the hybrid but a little more light was needed.I laughed at a lot of this movie and jumped at very little. It was fairly formulaic, intro character in time for character to be killed/become a breeder. I knew which characters were about to be taken out there was no surprise at all. The alien films were about scaring the life out of you, the predator films were about an alien code of life that we really do not understand. Putting them together is a bit tricky but I should at least jump once or twice not sit there going mmm this person is about to die.It is right down there with Deep Blue Sea (great for a laugh) not scary just predictable and silly.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
575,jonautopsy,An absolute nightmare,1,27 December 2007,"I'm a big fan of the Predator movie series. I'm an even bigger fan of the Alien series (yes, I liked all four movies). I thought the original AVP to be too rushed and not well thought out. However, when I first saw previews for the new AVP-R, I was jazzed. Finally, aliens in a city setting.Needless to say, I was wrong.Who thought up these characters? Not the aliens or predators, but the humans? Seriously, the movie could have done without half of them. And since the story doesn't really make you care about them to begin with, they're unnecessary, for the most part.Normal 'rules of engagement' for predators and aliens have gone out the window in this movie, which makes me think that not as much research was done on this movie, or that they just really didn't care. Neither would have surprised me.All in all, as sad as it is to say, this movie is worse than the original AVP. I almost walked out, and I don't walk out of movies.View at your own risk!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
576,slinkov,What's happened to sci-fi?,1,22 February 2008,"I haven't seen the first A.v.P film, so I've got nothing to compare this to. I didn't want to watch this either, but my friend wanted to, so I thought I might at least enjoy the effects and suspense. How wrong I was!Okay, first of all, there's no story, no feelings, no sense at all in fact, just a cliché-ridden bloodbath where annoying people, random aliens and a very stupid predator muck up each other's bodies for the sheer, unadulterated hell of it.Secondly, this was supposed to be a horror film. But it was too plain clumsy and predictable. In fact, the only time I actually drew in a sharp breath was when a random dog unexpectedly walked past. About ten minutes into the film, I had forgotten what the heck it was supposed to be about, and, by sheer willpower, succeeded in not falling asleep. And the gallons upon gallons of blood sloshed over every available surface, obviously an effort to please the computer-game-junkie thirteen-year-old males this movie was meant for, made me go 'Oh come on...' instead of 'Aargh!' So, to put it in a nutshell, if you want to waste an hour of your life, go do something else, and don't even bother watching this appalling excuse for a sci-fi horror film.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
577,eugene-101,Another pathetic sequel movie --Spoilers--,2,25 December 2007,"I went in 3 times today to watch this movie, cuz the first 2 times were sold out. Definitely not worth the repeat efforts...The first Part of the film was good, up until the predator skinned that cop. We all know that the Predator race are fearless hunters. They do not kill unarmed people as shown in the first 2 films. It is here to clean up a mess... not a hunting trip, and to kill a man running away is just not its style. Then, above all, to skin him and hang him upside down. There is no sport to that at all, while it was eliminating any evidence, it skins a man who was running away from it. Would any hunter who was on a mission to hunt down a killer bear, see a rabbit and waste his time to kill it and skin it? It would seem the writers were trying to insert something from the original predator movies into this one...There is plenty of gore to go around for those who want to see blood. Aliens getting cut up, blasted, or crushed is plenty of gore. Setting the aliens in a hospital of helpless newborns & pregnant women was just outrageous, and why did the hot blonde have to get killed? Are they trying to copy the Friday the 13th movies or something? Character development was not fully adequate, because the movie was way short of the 2 hour typical movie.Much of the fighting was done not in daylight so you can see it, but in utter darkness and you couldn't tell who was who and what was happening. Dark movies like this are just so frustrating, cuz you cannot see anything.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
578,connorpei,a kinda positive review *minor spoilers*,7,28 December 2007,"I have to say one thing to a bunch of people right now. The first AVP, everyone dissed it because it payed to much attention to the pointless characters and not enough Alien vs predator time. Now, you are all dissing AVP-R because there is not enough character time? Make up your minds! ...now that that's done. I enjoyed this movie better than the the first. It was rated R like the other Alien and Predator films. The visual effects were amazing, and even more so when the Predalien impregnated and already pregnant women. It was completely Bad-Ass when the Predator and Predalien fought each other in the end. I liked the fact that they used the mandibles of the Predalien to work as a face hugger and be like the queen (I now how much the VG's all had them like drones but you have to admit this is really original). There were a few plot holes that people pointed out and I agree with but some I don't, and to make sure no one gets made at me i will leave it at that. When the Predator came from the home-world by himself I knew something was going to give him help, and he got it with the second shoulder cannon, which got even cooler when he combined the two into one gun. A lot of people got angry that it was a walk in the park for the predator when it came to hunting the aliens, but who can blame them, The predator has guns and hunts these things for a living. This was a gory bad-ass film. Like come on, they kill babies and an 8 year old boy. none of the fights were very classic until the end but it was really cool anyways. The people that you would think would die died and even the ones you thought would live died. I would have given it 10/10 if there hadn't been any plot holes, although even when you watch it you don't notice them. The ending gives away a might-be sequel which would be really cool to see. Considering this one was better than AVP, the might-be AVP3 could be even better, because it seems fox is finally learning from there mistakesthe things i would change is simple, bring more predators so at least a few would die. Make the Aliens have closer matches with the predators like in the first AVP. And for once, can we see the aliens fight the predators on their home world? Othe than that it was pretty good.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
579,runion5,a little bit of a let down,3,22 January 2008,"personally i am an alien and a predator fan, a huge one at that. and i go to the theater thinking from the trailer that it is gonna be an kick butt film. and i get there and begin to watch it and it starts out really good. until about half way through the movie then it gets pitch dark and there is no way you can see anything. the hybrid and the predator look a lot alike and in these pitch black situations there is no way you can tell the deference! another issue i had was there was a lot of violence against children, i mean i was thinking who would be desperate enough to harm pregnant women and kids just to get a little bit of shock value that is really sick if ya ask me it just ain't right.but i really liked the idea of this one were they come to the average person's terrain also the special effects really rocked the film. the gore factor was freaking' awesome! good job Tom Wooddruff and Alec Gillis!!!!!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Look, people, this is supposed to be a fun movie not nessacarly (not sure if i spelled it right if not excuse my spelling) an Oscar film. I didn't go to the movie to see superb acting or a Super interesting plot or storyline. I came to see what the name suggests Alien Vs Predator. I was impressed as well. Not saying this is the greatest flick in the world. But in my opinion go buy the DVDs and watch it with your buddies while having a few beers or just hanging out ya know?. It's an entertaining movie,very faced paced, and action packed. i mean I'm a sci-fi geek and this was actually a pretty cool movie. I'd give it a 6.5 out of ten.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
581,scarehuman,So Gruesome its Rating is in the Title,8,29 December 2007,"Twentieth Century Fox releases AVP-R on Christmas because it is their Christmas present to us for the abomination that was its predecessor. The only thing that they could have done more was to let us watch it for free on Christmas morning in our jammies.Gone are the ""Hunter's Moons."" Gone are inane alliances with humans and greenhorn predators who don't even know what they are doing. Gone is the feeling that every character in the film is a difference race because they were trying way too hard to be politically correct.The strengths of this film stem from its directors' background in special effects. These people are geeks, making a movie for geeks. With their background comes the nostalgia that most of the film is shot in camera, meaning a minimum of digital effects and a maximum of make-up, puppet, and prosthetic wizardry. The alien sound effects, as many know, came from remastered original follies, attempting greater authenticity. It was a fast paced ride that never came up for air. Once the action began, it did not stop. Some would say this was a directorial weakness, not building up enough suspense. I contend that even the same audience that gladly sat through entire half hours of nothing happening in the 80's shuffle their feet now. The truth is there is nothing to build suspense for. We know the creatures. We know the history. We know the word ""versus"" is in the title, now give us our monster movie and wrap it in a plausible enough scenario that we care. The Strause Brothers achieved this, populating their town with every-folk, giving you a solid feeling of what would happen should Aliens and Predators drop down on Main Street USA.The film does have its weaknesses, notwithstanding. While I surmise none of the action and gore ended up on the cutting room floor, I feel many scenes adding depth to the human cast were left by the wayside. The interactions between some characters feels awkward and forced, that perhaps there is a deeper connection being told somewhere on another screen, and all we're allowed to see is the end product. My only true gripe with the film is that, and I don't think this constitutes any sort of a spoiler as this follows the precedent of the first, but as in the first AVP the aliens grow rapidly. I almost think they mature in a span of fifteen minutes, as was the case prior. While this is not consistent with the Alien series on a whole, it is consistent with AVP and therefore permissible. While I will say nothing of the ending, I will warn that it contains a reference to the established film continuity that is very vague, and if you are an average movie goer unfamiliar with the other movies, you will likely walk away scratching your head. But that's okay. That's why we have Google.End of the day, you will read many negative reviews from people who would find fault with a movie that materialized via magic onto the screen directly from their own imagination. This film stands head and shoulders above AVP, and the Strause Brothers should be commended for making such a valiant attempt at transitioning from creating creature effects to telling a story, and telling it with the fans in mind as much as possible. This film is our present from Fox. Don't let anyone spoil the surprise. Open it for yourself.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
582,opadelirium,Not so bad at all,7,26 April 2009,"I watched AVP-R again today and I still think the same as before: It is a pretty entertaining film. First of all, it works much better than the first AVP which had a pretty bad plot and story. C'mon, a human and a predator riding together hand in hand? Predators don't team up with anyone, they are just intelligent, extremely vicious creatures who like to test their strength against anyone worthy to battle against (Aliens and humans for example). This alliance in the first film made it bad, it could have been a good movie.But now in AVP2 things are different. There is this PredAlien (the King Alien who throws the jizz everywhere) and humans are again the sacrificial lambs who are just in the wrong place at the wrong time. PredAlien makes the predator spaceship crash at earth and soon aliens will spawn everywhere. Then the predator comes to deal with the mess from another planet, trying to kill all the aliens. Humans are just in his way, the predator ignores them unless they are a threat to him. Of course, the humans don't just stand aside and be slaughtered so they fight back for survival. Voila, we have a real all against all setting, the stage is set. And this is good.I think this movie has one considerable new angle if you compare it to the Alien movies or the last AVP: The environment is in a normal town in the US. Predator used this in it's second film, but it was a major city, this is a medium sized town in this film. The battle stadium is completely different and it makes this more personal film. All the characters get much screen time and since this film has several main characters, it works well. The battles look great, especially the final showdown with predator and Predalien. And one good thing about this movie is also that it is not constant battling, the battles are not long and they come every now and then so you can't get bored of them.Let's continue with the good sides. The music in the film is good. The best thing about this movie is still this: It is pretty brutal. The scene at the hospital is very good, as the PredAlien watches the innocent babies and then pumps the ladies full of alien eggs, so they can burst in masses from the pregnant women. Heads explode, human bodies get melted by acid, limbs fall off, blood bursts from everywhere. Everything works in the violence side. One last good thing about the movie is the plot, it is actually pretty good. Good for a action film and way better than in the first AVP.Now the bad things. Some of the actors are pretty lame. You can get a peep inside the main characters but the film doesn't have any personal characters as Predators 1 & 2 or (especially) Aliens 1-3 had. The teen love thing/the sad bully-bullied settlement is awful but I think the death of the teen girl (don't remember the name) at the end recovered a lot from the whole angle. Definitely the best part of the movie was when the sexy teen girl gets nailed in the wall by predator. But still, the whole teen love angle should have been replaced by a little better angle.In the end, Alien vs. Predator 2 is very enjoyable action film. Not the best, not by a long shot, but it doesn't ruin the legacy of Aliens or Predators, as the first AVP did. The characters should be more original and some plot changes should have taken place, but AVP2 is still a exciting, brutal and entertaining action film that also has a pretty good ending. I recommend if you want to watch an action film that doesn't require so much attention.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Carnage ensue. Lighlty sprinkle some Army and Government type **** around for the **** of it. Four marbles, I mean, people survive the cluster ****, and that's it.

584,Juxtrip,Brilliant to see the wonderful creatures again in a fun story if you try to ignore the annoyances,4,5 December 2008,"The only enjoyable thing about this movie is seeing the aliens again and the on-going cat-and-mouse game between the predator and the pred-alien. Also seeing the aliens on Earth for the first time (except for Antarctica in the last film) is interesting but it's a pity it had to happen for the first time in this film and not a better one. As for the rest of it, I can't believe how much most of the film is filled with rip-offs from Alien, Aliens and Alien3 instead of coming up with more original ideas... e.g. A Ripley/Newt relationship similarity exists, sound FX rip-offs from the Nostromo and almost the exact same shot that was used in Alien3 of the alien scuttling up to the side of Ripley's cheek to check her out. All in all a bit of fun if you try to ignore the annoyances and definitely worth seeing if you are an Alien fan just to see more of the wonderful creatures again.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
585,mrniceguy21,"A crowd pleasing, aliens-esquire sequel that will delight the fanboys!",9,26 December 2007,"I saw AVPR last night at the movies with high expectations after the disappointing Aliens Vs Predator movie that fell way short, and I have to say I really enjoyed it and thought that this was the type of AVP movie that everyone had been waiting for. Now, don't get me wrong, it wasn't 100% spot on and of course, there were flaws with the character selection and storyline, but all in all, the movie delivers everything that one expects from an alien movie - gore, shocks, amazing special effects and plenty of thrills and spills.The movie sort of takes the next step from Alien Resurrection's ending and brings the aliens to earth and explores the massacre that happens when aliens are let loose amongst the general population, and there are plenty of shocks and scares when some unsuspecting homeless person, father and son hunting team or high school jock runs into a facehugger or alien sentry.The characters aren't particularly interesting - there's no Ripley here - but at the end of the day, you want the humans to live and for the aliens not to spread past the town's borders and infest the rest of the world - there were plenty of shocks and gasps when the main characters are killed one by one in a manner of gruesome encounters.The best thing about the movie for me had to be all the nods to the original movies - the opening titles have the sound effect from aliens when Hudson is tracking the aliens and they're coming closer and closer, when the humans get into the army truck and drive off the score is similar to when Ripley commanders the naval soldiers' truck and drives the rescue mission into the aliens nest, when the civil guard attacks the aliens, you have the same screaming, mass chaos and alien screams that you hear when the soldiers get attacked in aliens, and of course, the ending with the mystery lady......All in all, this was the kind of AVP and alien movie that I was looking forward to and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope the ongoing interest in the franchise encourages Cameron or Scott or Weaver to get back to the drawing board and bring us a new Alien movie to continue the alien story - with Ripley!Go see it, shocks and gore galore!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
586,submitor,Buckets of Blood = Buckets of Fun!,6,31 December 2007,"From the moment the R-rated trailer came out I knew this movie was not going to have any qualms about letting both the Aliens and the Predator let loose on humanity.This movie is very superior to the original and it gets back to the original concept which was to see Aliens and the Predator fight on the big screen. The Predator is back to his true nature of being a infrared sighted killing machine, while the Aliens are seen doing what they do best: killing and multiplying. The character development was loose to non-existent at best and this may be a turn off for some expecting to see more than just mayhem. In this story, humans are entirely irrelevant because realistically they do not have what it takes to defeat these deadly creatures hands-on. What we get as a result is a quick dissent into chaos in a small town in Colorado as the two main antagonists collide with plenty of thrills and disturbing scenes of carnage.Those who were expecting a multi-depth story will be thoroughly disappointed and most likely have not viewed the trailers. This movie is exactly what the title says: Aliens versus Predator!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
587,Cyberik,Implausible,3,5 June 2008,"I can overlook many aspects of a film. Cheezy effects don't bother me that much, I don't always crave top notch acting (especially in a movie like this), and the odd plot-hole here and there i can fill with my imagination. Something I don't like however is illogical and implausible things, and in AVPR they just multiply. To name a few; the spontaneous evolution of a new super predator-alien-hybrid (which unfortunately adds a quasi-supernatural element to the plot), the new and improved alien egg-laying method, the swift travel from planet Predator to earth, the maturing of alien spawn to adult in minutes (maybe the only detail that bothered me from the first Alien-movie), the vaporizing of an entire pool with a touch of blue liquid (which by the way seems undepletable), the capricious nature of alien acid-blood that burns some to pulp in seconds and leaves others untouched, etc etc. I love the concept of aliens vs predators but this was a sloppy made movie. Ususally the attention to detail makes good movies, and in AVPR one is struck by the feeling that it has been made in haste. ""Quick! Lets make some money!"" seems the motto.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

A lot of things do not make sense, use of the blue potions, aliens spawned so fast out of nowhere (considering there's not a queen)...etc. Then there are too many side stories, the movie spent 5 minutes introducing each character that would appear for another 2 minutes before getting killed.The whole movie is like a plate of scrambled eggs. The director probably is not even a fan of AvP and just mixed put all the materials into one giant pile of rubbish.Stay away from this movie at all cost. It'll not only be a waste of time, but also a complete let down to the originals.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
589,palaeo,I 100% agree with the first reviewer- forget the first AVP and love this!!,8,25 December 2007,"I saw this a premiere in the Christmas day at downtown Montreal. I would like to give an edge on Lando, the first reviewer. Yeah, it resuscitated as a new breed with the old styles. Personally, it was quite a long time for me to be amazed by a screen in a theater because recent movie experience of mine was limited to the home-theater DVD. I bet it is worth viewed in a Hi-Fi big screen and strongly recommend it.To title this movie, I think it can be called a hybrid genre. It carefully preserves and contains the authentic auras of both the Alien and the Predator series. To some extent, it still resorts to some cliché of two movies (e.g. the human host, the hi-tech arsenal of predators, the gruesome violence of both species); but as far as I remember, this piece is well-intermingled with the elements of overall stereotypes and keeping a good balance, conditionally and emotionally, between two extremities: the action and the suspense.Remember the P1. It is highly touting the muscles of Arnie and maze-like jungle scenes. The P2 shifted from the natural to an urban environment- the downtown LA among crowded people. Now, the geographical setting of the AVP2 is suburban Colorado (a good mixture of both wilderness and urbanism) and the Predator, the main hero, SINGLEHANDEDLY cope with humans, aliens and the Predalien, the main villain. I love the most the streamline of its emotional setting. Several people gather in the town and they have their own personal background history; they are somewhat victimized by both aliens and the predator; somewhat they fight against them at their own costs. However, there is no bull-shi**y alliance between humans and predator; he just hunts down the hostile regardless of species; tries to settle down the mayhem caused by the unexpected birth of the predalien as well as revenging on behalf of his slaughtered cohorts.Unlike the clumsy narratives of AVP1 depending on the archaeological inscription, the instinctive behavior and prompt reaction to the situation of both species are well-demonstrated in AVP2, just like the separate series decades ago. Especially the intervention of unidentified authority, whether it is the Company of the Alien series or the Secret Governmental Agency of P2, was timely launched without sacrificing the main plot of battling scene among humans, aliens and the predator. In sum, it is more than a success which preserved and synthesized the original cinematic experience brought about by both series. Another sequel is highly anticipated in the same vein.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

591,cwatson8,I liked it,7,31 December 2007,"I cannot believe the amount of people who hated this movie. What were they expecting ""Gone with the Wind"" or a Disney classic? The movie is plain and simply a monster movie with action and some sci-fi with a little plot. The movie delivers the monsters and action the majority of the time. Some people are bent out of shape by the fact that a young boy watches his father killed by a chest burster, is himself killed by a chest burster, expectant mothers in a maternity ward are killed and the implication that innocent babies are killed. Yes it pushes the envelope but it does play to the fact that the Aliens and Predator are merciless killers. If you are caught in their path and are in the wrong place at the wrong time as with nature you are doomed. If you want a tame monster movie go pull out your old Disney DVD' of Beauty and the Beast.I can't believe the God awful ""I Am Legend"" got better ratings and it's nothing more that a vehicle to promote Will Smith.

I watched it thinking it came out this last year and I somehow missed it, and was astonished to find I was more than 7 years off.(Sigh) Witnessing extreme and shocking violence shot and edited unforgivingly in the style of my favorite 90's mega-disaster flick was a hefty punch my expectations' smug face.

593,Jackawittz128,Intentions vs. Execution,4,25 February 2017,"The 2000's were a rough decade for any Alien or Predator fan. While there were two huge Hollywood releases uniting the two creatures, the combination seemed to devalue the two franchises instead of amplifying their prestige. For a time, it seemed as though the two franchises had become deadlocked, dependent on one another for survival, and robbed of their individual charm. Thankfully, Prometheus and Predators have since set the franchises on the right track. Aliens vs Predator: Requiem is the moment when all hope seemed lost.The first AVP film was admirable in its novel premise, good cinematography, visual effects, fight scenes, and not much else. The human element of AVP left much to desired, and afterwards, while you were glad the crossover existed, you probably weren't raring to see another one, but considering how much money it made, a sequel was inevitable. AVPR is clearly made by fans of both franchises. Fans will notice the nods and shout-outs scattered throughout the film, (including MUTHUR sound effects from Alien, and Alan Silvestri's foreboding drum cue from Predator), but as big of fans the directors seem to be, they certainly didn't feel like bringing the franchise to any new heights.Requiem is, if anything, the lowest point of either franchise. With dark and muddled cinematography, one-dimensional characters with just enough tired backstory to make them feel developed, and dialogue on par with The Happening (""The government doesn't lie to people!""). The cast includes such memorable characters as the wimpy troubled highschooler who looks 28, his bad boy ex-con brother named Dallas (franchise nod!), the token police officer, Cricket from ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"", and a mother back from service in the military (who was one of the few characters I somewhat liked).The film is essentially a bad slasher sequel, with just-die-already characters, and increasingly gruesome kills (including an utterly tasteless maternity ward massacre). As for the ""Predalien"", the abominable hybrid teased at the end of AVP 1, it's nothing too spectacular, It's there just to kill and be killed. Alien Resurrection put more thought and care into its nasty Ripley clone. Fans of Alien, fans of Predator, unless you're a die-hard completionist, don't bother with this one. However, I don't want the reception of these films to sour people on the idea of an Alien/Predator crossover. The Dark Horse comics that inspired the movie are considerably better.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
594,stebai,"Lazy, too dark and rather silly.",3,28 December 2007,"How i wanted to like this, my hopes weren't high after reading reviews but i like to make my own mind up. The movie was worse than the reviews.. The problems are many, the good moments, few. In all fairness the first 10 minutes offer some hope for this to be a worthy installment in the series. It sets the premise well, alas 'tis all down hill from there. My main gripes are: 1) Where are must all the facehuggers come from. We see maybe 4 or 5 in the Pred ship at the start but the number of aliens running around the town at the end of the movie dictates a Queen must be laying eggs somewhere to create the facehuggers - we never see this. If its the Predalien in the hospital thing then forgive me - but thats just too silly to contemplate. 2) The Predalien - Not once do you see it clearly - it's all too dark and fast moving in it's action scenes to get a good look at. Very disappointing. 3) Lazy movie-making - Steals way too much from previous films (from characters, to script, to sound effects...etc) It's one thing to pay homage but another to be too bloody lazy to create your own episode.

595,pixelguru,An absolute train wreck,2,19 April 2009,"I have yet to be able to sit through this entire production - though I've seen enough that I feel I can write this review. This movie brought two strong existing sci-fi icons down to the level of something I'd expect to see in a made-for-cable production. It took the brilliant sci-fi of the Alien's plausible and well thought out biology and made an absolute mockery of it for little more than shock value. What made many of the previous Alien and Predator movies such a success was that they were a delicious mix of science fiction and Gothic horror - with a small group of humans contained in a nightmarishly hostile environment. Trying to somehow make this movie work in generic small-town America with a bunch of teen movie characters... pathetic. Two stars - one for the Alien, and one for the Predator... no more.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
596,angelus-18,Quite Disappointing,1,17 February 2008,"The 1st Alien vs Predator wasn't as terrible as made out to be but it did leave a sour taste in the mouth. The Studio's decision to go ahead with a sequel seemed to stem only from the Box Office success of the first film, as opposed to any creative reasons. At the time of AvP's release Anderson often said that a sequel was never intended, despite the open-ended conclusion to the film. Fox however thought better of that + this is what they served up...Alien vs Predator: Requiem is an unnecessary sequel + all around an unnecessary film. One of the key selling points was the R rating that the previous film lacked. The ""gore"" in this film however is beyond ridiculous + really isn't anything to get excited about. It's the type of gore you would expect to see in an 80's slasher film but not an Alien or Predator movie. Speaking of Slasher, that is essentially what this film is, a Slasher flick with Aliens + Predators. The setting is a small American town which totally goes against anything set in the previous Alien films (with Aliens running loose on Earth + all). The characters are mostly teenagers with few exceptions. The script is absolutely dreadful + the dialogue horrendous. Many lines came off as being funny even though that was never the intention of the film. The pacing of the film is also a key issue here. Everything feels rushed + the movie never really takes its time to build itself up. The lighting + texture of the film also left much to be desired, such as what was actually going on on screen.The film isn't all bad of course, just extremely disappointing. The movie starts well enough with us on the Predator ship last seen at the end of AvP. I would have to say that most scenes following Wolf (the star Predator) were excellent, starting with his introduction + the shots of the Predator home world. The scenes with Wolf were the only scenes that were really interesting + pulled you in, making you believe you much a much better movie than you actually were. A few other scenes were very interesting as well but they were few + far between.As for the Aliens however... they have been reduced here to nothing more than bugs. There designs aren't terrible but they certainly aren't great. The real problem is their seeming lack of intelligence in the film. The new reproductive system introduced in the film by the Predalien is also completely pointless. It is of course unexplained + yet i think that is OK as i don't really want an explanation.There are some decent scrums in the film between the two title creatures which are entertaining but the Predator often has the upper hand. The problem with a lot of them, espec the Sewer battle, was that they were way to dark and the editing was very poor in a lot of spots. The film really seems very poorly put together. With it's script it was never going to be great but it could have been flushed out so it didn't seemed rushed + the editing certainly could have been better. One key instance, speaking of fleshing the movie out, is the National Guard sequences that was advertised before the film. It came and gone it what seemed like 2 minutes. It would have been a perfect opportunity to create tension + suspense but it was wasted. As soon as the guards stepped on to the ground they were taken away.Overall i feel this film was very unneeded + we would have been better off it had not been made. There were some good aspects + scenes that could have been very good if executed well but they simply weren't. A sequel to AvP nev er seemed necessary although a quality follow-up would be gladly welcomed. This however is not that film. It is Fox trying to make a quick buck off the name of ""Alien"" + ""Predator"" + nothing else. If they wanted the film to be good they could have started by not green lighting the awful script. Maybe they will get it right with AvP 3 (it's bound to happen eventually) yet my fear is they will only lower the budget further + we will be left with another half-assed Alien vs Predator.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
597,the_super_saiyajin_prince,"If Slither get's a 6+ on this site, AvP R deserves a damn award!",8,12 January 2008,"OK, well I decided to see this again as I hadn't had a chance being back in the UK until it was released on DVD last Monday.It was actually better than I remembered, though still not great.Quibble #1 - It was supposed to be explained in AvP why the aliens gestated and grew so quickly, I had heard this scene found it's way back into the unrated edition but I've never seen it. But either way, that explains the same growth within the strain on Earth in AvPR, but I just feel the Predalien grew far too quickly for the ship to pull out of Earth's atmosphere only to crash back on to the planet again, so unless it was orbiting Earth (which I doubt) it just seems to be a bit too rushed.Quibble #2 - Length of the movie, god damnit there's nothing wrong with having it longer...Fox and/or the movie theatres need to realise there's more to entertainment for the fans than how many times in a day they can see it.Quibble #3 - Aliens/Predator was never rated below 18, and these films shouldn't be either. Yes, it was entertaining for the most part and better than the first (and gorier) but still didn't earn an 18 rating.Quibble #4 - Just a tad too dark for my liking, Alien movies have to be dark in places but not by that much.Other than that, the usual problems from the series arose, weakish story and so forth. Though I thought the Predalien's little ""talent"" in using pregnant hosts was pretty neat.My other complaints are about other peoples complaints though.""Oh my god, they killed kids and pregnant women"" - ...Well DUH, the aliens do NOT take in to concideration what their pray is, they just use them as hosts or food...simple as that.""The music was too loud and too recycled"" - They made this film for the fans, or tried to apparently, music was also going to play a similar role. I thought it was great the Predator got his P1 theme back, and generally the music is similar to AvP, Aliens and Predator (the first) in many respects.""The aliens grew too quickly"" - Do your research and you'll find out why this was so in this particular strain.""Why only one Predator?"" - Who knows, but this particular Predator obviously felt it was his job to finish what his people couldn't.Overall, it was decent enough, not as good as I'd hoped but better than I expected and better than the first. Look forward to at least season where the extra 7 minutes fit in. Why do I rate it at 8? Because on a basic string of ""Predators kicking the living **** out of Aliens"" is there, so on a basis of not caring about the story as much...it's fantastic.However, if there is a third they need to not miss the chance to make it an awesome 18 adult movie to really make the separate franchises crap themselves, otherwise...just get Alien 5 and Predator 3 in the works and finish those movies.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
598,davidkimau,WOW.... Please someone give me a PANADOL.,1,27 December 2007,"WOW.... Just saw AVP: Reqiuem and I have to say it was a true making of a disaster. WHAT THE HELL WAS GOING ON THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE? No acting, very vague story line, just killing and more killing of aliens without making a point than just a alien juice fest. Actors were nothing more than C grade. Please tell me, where the actors acting actually scared or just being sad? The music was just rerecorded tapes from the original predator movies. Nothing new. There was 2 seconds of innovation, when you get to see the predator's planet for the first time. WoW. I paid so much for such rubbish. There was no horror at all. It was actually funny. The ""BAD"" humour mind you. Watching Rambo is one thing, when a predator, takes on the entire alien colony plus it's 'mutant alien' - nice try but come on. NO!!!! I left the cinema with a bad headache.I loved the original movies: Predator, Alien, Aliens. They are genius in the making. Just look at the ratings if you don't believe me. But when people try to put two things into one... they just mash it up. Leave it alone!!! It's like mashing Chocolate biscuit and Orange Juice. I love both but separately.AVP IS JUST A DISASTER.

599,rayafahreza,A Real Requiem,4,12 September 2008,"Honestly, I gave this movie the benefit of a doubt and chose not to listen too much to the bad reviews. I can be quite tolerant when I like something, unfortunately though, this second AVP is really disappointing.At first, it seemed to be quite interesting to see Aliens let loose on present-day earth, add to that, the cool Predator. It can be exciting, or at least, a change from dark corridors. But alas, it didn't work. The whole movie was flat, lacking tension and suspense we come to expect of the franchise. Yes there are action, but many scenes are just plain too dark that you can't really see what's going on. Also, after the first AVP, I didn't expect a good story, I expected another lame plot, but wow, this movie's story and plot is beyond lame. Characters? There's not one character you'll care for in this movie. Eye candy, special FX and CGI? Nothing to shout about, in fact, this time it feels like ""Alien: The B-Movie Version"" because of the dark and tight shots makes you think that they're hiding something. Plot logics? None whatsoever in fact it's so cheap I feel like playing a video game cut scenes. Nothing worked. I don't want to go on.I gave this movie a 4 star because, heck, I've seen many movies that are worse. But while this may not be the worst movie ever, it's hard to say anything good about it. A real requiem to two great movie franchise. Why would Fox do this?",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
600,baseballguy11avp,A big improvement,10,28 December 2007,"I have to say that after seeing Aliens vs. Predator Requiem, the first Alien vs. Predator was shut out in a lot of categories. AVPR didn't quite have the actors fans or other movie watchers would of liked but they did a much better job than the actors in AVP in my opinion. Each of the characters were more interesting then the AVP ones, even if the actors in AVPR weren't the greatest. Other than the actors AVPR was filled with great action sequences, Daniel Pearl did a great job, Brian Tyler's score could of been more intense and action based but other than that the movie kept me entertained.So overall I'd say Aliens vs. Predator Requieum was a big success over AVP and all Alien and Predator fans should see this film because I believe it gives the creatures what they deserved from the beginning.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
601,naccigolf,Aliens vs Predator: Requiem - SAVE YOUR MONEY,1,28 December 2007,"Spoiler from Minute One! So you know.Man! I don't know where to start. This movie is just awful. It starts off with some promise but slides into the toilet in a matter of minutes and never recovers. I now understand why they never previewed this one to the reviewers. They would have eaten their lunch and saved us the price of admission.From the best I can tell, 1 to 3 days, tops transpires in the movie. Yet, we go from chest burster on the space craft to final destruction of a town after massive infestation of Aliens in the few days portrayed. This is SOOOO LAME.This movie has massive plot holes. Like bringing a body on the ship without scanning it. The Predators scan everything and everyone except a dead Predator with a chest burster in it. Who thinks this crap up?After the chest burster comes out, it is an immediate threat, full grown in nano-seconds causing havoc and the eventual crash. Cause of crash? Predator using blaster in the ship and missing. More crap.From this point, it simply slides deeper into the ""waste of film"" category this movie truly is. There is almost zero character development so you don't really care who dies. And trust me, almost everyone dies. How do you make a movie where the audience simply doesn't care, one way or the other about any single one character in the entire movie? The predator alien is one nasty dude. Uhm, dame. Uhm, I am not sure what it is. It lays eggs through its mouth and fills a pregnant womens belly with quadruplets. They hatch faster than you can say ""gross"" and they are full grown and redecorating the hospital in less than a scene..... What a load of crap. Again, this is all taking place in a 1 - 3 day period at best!!The Aliens are fast moving, real fast!!! They are all over town, in sewers, in homes, in stores, in the hospital, in the restaurants, the hydro plant etc etc etc. They're everywhere, they're everywhere.... and there are TONS of them almost immediately!! Grown up and good to go! What a load of crap!Overall, this movie LACKS everything. A main character you can like. Characters you can sympathize with. A hero. In fact, it has nothing. I can't think of one redeeming feature this movie has other than some really inconsequential special effects. Even then, the special effects are horribly lacking!!! Seriously. Why was this movie made?In space, no one can hear you scream. In this movie, in the dark, no one can see your special effects aren't that special.Truly, another sh*t movie that threatens to destroy an unbelievable, classic, sci-fi franchise. What two better species to do a movie about and holy crap, Hollywood does it again... CRAP. Major Plot Holes:  Bringing a dead predator on the ship without a scan of his body.  Instant adult alien from chest burster, that immediately goes on the kill.  Predator using his blaster to try to kill the alien and misses causing the ship to crash.  The whole dad, son and crash site scene. One minute they are miles away, the next, they are doing the face hugger dance near the ship.  Where did all the predators from AvP disappear to on this ship??  The whole spread of Aliens in a day or two is completely bogus.  The territory covered-infested by the aliens in a couple of days is totally bogus.  The hospital scene is ridiculous at best. Especially the supper duper fill the belly with chest bursters!! I laughed, it was so ridiculous. In Aliens 2, you had a station that took some time for the queen and the bugs to start layering the walls of the station with Alien goo. It happens in this hospital in minutes. These are the most industrious Aliens you will ever see. Did I mention they are everywhere???  The ending is almost as ridiculous. The helicopter leaves with our heroes, the city is nuked and the ARMY is right there where they crash. Are they shot? Nope. Hell no. They could have a chest burster in them and that would spoil AvP3. They did nuke a city to kill off all the Aliens (how did they figure out there were all these Aliens? Another plot hole!) but contain people coming out of the city. Hell no.Because this movie is done on earth, there are almost NO SPECIAL EFFECTS to speak of. LOW BUDGET SCI-FI MOVIE. Good formula. Make a crappy movie, don't show the critics, launch it a Christmas when everyone is looking to be entertained. Make fast money. Run. ALL CRAP.Unless you stop spending your money to go see CRAP like this, Hollywood will do this to us OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.SAVE YOUR MONEY. SEND A MESSAGE.This movie is crap. Don't waste your time. Don't waste your money going to see it. If you really have to, buy a bootleg.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

So AvP-R comes out, its rated R already looking better.and it was. it didn't need all of the gore it had, but it made feel more like a predator movie. also having the language in it too gave it the right tone. the fights were done well and acting was acceptable. but it still wasn't what AvP should be. i would have liked to see more aliens getting the best of different predators, instead of just one predator owning all the aliens. also the ending was predictable.

603,bigguynreno_1,Worse Movie Ever,1,23 November 2008,"OK, lets be realistic here. The first AVP was not the best film to ever be made. However, as a tribute to all of those AVP comic books, novels and web site fans, it accomplished it's task. Also, it at least made a modicum of sense. The film makers even hired Keven Peter Hall to reprise his performance as the Predator(s). No such luck for this film.But, this film, from the very beginning makes no sense at all. Especially for those among us who are fans of the Alien and/or Predator franchises. The film makers obviously sat down and decided, seriously, to throw away everything they knew about Aliens and Preditors. Just make it up as you go along. That way we can make a fresh film. Sounds great when you think about it. But, the way they made it fresh detracted from the franchises and left the actual Alien and Predator fans out in the cold.The special effects for this film were of the quality of the veritable man in the monster suit. Even the technical special effects are below par. The quality of the special effects go back to the early 1970's in quality. Nothing technically advanced in the entire film.I don't give films a rating of One out of Ten. I hate doing it. Even the stupidest films I'm seen usually deserve a rating higher than One out of Ten. Unfortunately, because of all that I stated above this is only the second film to receive this vote from me. The only other one was ""Exorcist II The Heretic.""",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

The first AVP was garbage outside of a stretch of 10 minutes where we saw the fighting that we paid to see. But the hybrid creature that burst from the Predator's chest at the end? Enticing cliffhanger. What happens when you crossbreed a perfect killing machine that sulks in the shadows without being seen, with the perfect hunting creature that hides in the trees? Apparently you get a big lizard hellbent on smashing his head against literally everything in sight. The characters are garbage, the plot is garbage, it's a technically bad movie in every sense of the word, but primarily it's an over-the-top gorefest without any of the fun attached.

606,chechrissie,Rubbish,10,2 January 2008,"If only I had read the review by Alex Sander (sic) on here rather than looking at the rating of over 6 from a select choice of the ignorant viewing public I would not have seen this desecration. Alien was a fantastic, dramatic and well made horror/sci-fi. Predator was a great sci-fi/action mess-about. I do really have only myself to blame though as I saw 'Alien versus Predator'. It too has an average grading of over 6 stars from the connoisseurs of film that frequent this site. STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY FEAR OF THIS EVER SO SUSPENSE RIDDEN PLOT BEING RUINED FOR YOU. Right from the beginning this film was ridiculous. No explanation was offered for the Predator ship overrun/not overrun by Aliens. OK so maybe they were again going to throw aliens down to Earth to hunt them and something went wrong but how did this result in an Alien/Predator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology? The start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had some idea of who was who or what was what and perhaps why. From then on it gets really ridiculous. I always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the door of the screen before entering and collect it on the way out. I couldn't here. A father and son are hunting in the woods. The damaged ship crash lands to (from the view given) I would calculate at the very least 10 odd miles away through thick woodland. The man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hugged. Even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face huggers are almost comical rather than scary in their movement and actions and the father seems like such an irresponsible, dumb redneck muppet. An edgy, thriller-type scenario is introduced with an ex-con returning to the town near the crash site to be met by his somewhat emotionless, dull now cop friend from the bus. When I say introduced I mean a feeble attempt with crap actors and no feeling is played out. A slasher/horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who gets beaten up by the over protective, crazy, nasty Jock type (American sportsman not a Scottish man). Oh the cute/not cute boy is the ex-con's brother by the way. Yes they're clever these director brothers whose name I will research in order to avoid any other shite they put out again. Then a modern role reversal oh so boring attempt at PC, Ripley credential type character introduction comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child. Guess what happens next? I won't tell you much more about the actual (smiles sadly to himself about the demise of storytelling in the large majority of recent films) plot just in case you have got this far and are not the brightest star in the Alien-ridden universe. The Predator is stupid for the reasons stated by the previous poster whose post I read too late. The Aliens are boring. The Predator-Alien is ridiculous. The action is at times exploitative, gratuitous, disgusting nonsense. The hospital scene with the pregnant mothers?!?! Oh I was shocked alright. Shocked at how low some people will go to get what? A scare? Some shock? To titillate the perverse? What? If you really wanted to shock, titillate and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting fathers or who have no souls why not just have the Alien/Predator shagging the saucy women and teenage girls rather than killing them? The characters have no depth and neither does the plot. It's filmed and paced badly. It's acted by disinterested people not that I can blame them. It further tarnishes two rather interesting and good sets of sci-fi characters. This film was rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it I really have to worry about you. If you haven't seen it then well please make your own decision. PS Did I even mention the way that trained soldiers are all killed in about 20 seconds while amateur civilians survive throughout?",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
607,SpikeFortress,a return to the intense style of both original classics - forget avp1!!,9,25 December 2007,"The best action movie in many many years returns to the style that makes the original alien and Predator movies so classic and enjoyable. The terror of the alien invasion tactic is amazing to watch, and Predator culture is as badass as ever.The fights are very epic... far better than the first avp movie. The sets showing aliens infesting human territory are excellently done, more like in Aliens. Also, unlike in Transformers, the use of human and military characters doesn't interrupt the real focus we're here to see: aliens and predators causing terror and destruction! That said, a few things are understated and some impacts could've been more brutal, but the action is in many cases easily better than many recent action movies.The real gold under it all was that I was intensely satisfied by the expansion of the epic mythology built up through each Alien and Predator movie so far, as well as in the AVP games and novels. It was epic to see the beginnings of the Wayland-Yutani Corporation taken a step further (it appears in Alien and Aliens, and remember the Weyland corporation that starts the search for the temple in AVP1?) Also there's some internet joke references that are like icing on the cake (admiral ackbar, Schwarzenegger quotes).I was really satisfied overall and hope more movies are like this, it could be the revival of the true Hollywood action blockbuster.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
608,Pat_ChoKo,A Step Up from the First AVP.,6,25 April 2008,"After the travesty that was Alien vs Predator, I wasn't really expecting much from Aliens vs Predator: Requiem. In all honesty, I was expecting more of the same. The last film had a lot of in-excusable flaws, (which I won't go into detail about here. This is, after all, a review of AVP: R, not AVP.) and not to say that this film isn't flawed, but it is a big step in the right direction for this franchise.In Aliens vs Predator: Requiem, the Brothers Strause pick up the ball that Paul W.S. Anderson fumbled with the last film. The raw, gory, effects are here, which were sorely missing in AVP. The Aliens are in the shadows again; not out in plain sight and harsh light, as in the original. The Predator(s) actually look right in AVP:R; instead of the bulky, NFL-linebacker-like look in AVP, the Preds in AVP:R look like they're supposed to; lean, sleek, and stealthy.As I said before, the Aliens in this film lurk in the shadows, like they're supposed to. In the glimpses you do see of them, they look great. Going back to the ridged-head-design from Jim Cameron's Aliens was a very nice touch and a treat for the fans of the franchise. To put it bluntly, 99.9% of the special effects in this film are perfect. The fights between the title creatures are perhaps the film's greatest improvement over AVP. Instead of being derived from something you'd see on a pro-wrestling program, here the creatures are allowed to shine in all their glory. To put it simply: Everything you wanted in the first film, action-wise, is here.At the end of the day, the best thing that AVP:R does is show how incompetent of a director that Paul W.S. Anderson is. The Brothers Strause vastly improved what was, seemingly, a sinking ship.I said before that the film is not without it's flaws. The story and characters within aren't all that great; On one end, you have standard, teenie-fare. On the other, you have a family drama. (Which is obviously derived, and a nod/homage, to the Newt/Ripley relationship from Aliens). Along the way, these two story lines cross; interwoven with the aforementioned, and very awesome, Alien/Predator carnage. Previously, I mentioned that 99.9% of the special effects were perfect. It would be wrong not to mention the .1% that was slightly off. The CGI in this film isn't terrible, but one or two flubs may catch your eye. Another thing that I've noticed is that the transfer on the DVD is really dark (and, from what I've heard, it was also dark in theaters.) and it's hard to see what's going on in a few spots. For some reason, I don't consider this a technical glitch. If it was merely a glitch, I'm thinking that they would have fixed it for the DVD release. The most plausible answer would be that cinematographer Daniel Pearl lit the film a bit too dark. As for the acting, overall, it's pretty good. However, the only real stand-out performances are from John Ortiz (previously seen in Michael Mann's Miami Vice), who plays the not-so-sure-of-himself town Sheriff, and Ian Whyte as The Predator. (Who also portrayed the Predator(s)in the first AVP.) The story is very basic. A couple of lose ends aren't tied up but, overall, this film delivers and is a very fun watch.6.5/10",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

""we're keeping it close to alien & aliens."" what fan wouldn't be excited for that?while it's true that this isn't ""predator and pals"", avp:r doesn't fare much better than the original. though the film is far more relentless than ""aliens vs. predator"", ""requiem"" falls into much the same trappings as its predecessor.the biggest problem with this movie are the human characters. very early on in avp:r, we are shown that absolutely no one is safe, which i thought was great. women and children are murdered in grotesque fashion. i have no qualms with this. what i do take issue with is the very fact that by the time we are forced into caring about these characters, several of them are brutally killed off. this wouldn't even be so offensive except for the fact that they waste a significant chunk of the movie attempting to build them up.though i understand that the filmmakers probably had a desire to mislead or confuse the audience about who would survive, (something else i thought was great), considering that the movie isn't very long, it really takes away from what people came to see ""aliens vs. predator"" for - the aliens and the predator. we are teased with flashes of facehuggers only to be pulled away where we are forced to endure long scenes of exposition about these characters who don't even matter.the first half of avp:r is paced so frustratingly slow that when it comes time for the chaotic second half, it simply seems a mad dash through leaving us with the impression that it was all over too soon. as the scant few moments in avp:r when our aliens and predator actually do come head-to-head are actually quite engaging, the film only becomes that much more unsatisfying to watch. the film itself is even presented in such a fashion that we don't ever really feel the true menace of the aliens or the predator. they are simply set pieces for a brief action spectacle.while it is admirable that the people involved did have the desire to make a great movie based on the alien and predator franchises, this just isn't it. here's hoping the inevitable avp 3 will fare better.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

The action scenes were terrible. We couldn't really see what the hell was happening most of the time. Predator seems to move around the city and pops out of nowhere through out the whole movie while there was ONLY one predator. If you have seen the trailer, you have seen the movie.

If it was just another straight-to-DVD teen monster slasher B-movie, it probably would have been more appreciated. But if you look at it like an Alien/Predator movie, you realize it's crap compared to the other alien/predator films. A lot of people say AVP was crap because of the PG-13 rating (less blood/gore/violence)and that this was the same crap as AVP only with a couple more ""f"" words. I'm just trying to say that this movie is average in monster attack B-movie standards, but in Alien or Predator standards, it's pretty awful compared to Alien, Aliens or Predator.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

I disliked the first AvP, and even that movie was better than this one. I am an avid movie-goer and give every movie I see an honest chance, but I was almost tempted to walk out of this one.I kept telling myself, maybe it will get better, or maybe this scene will make it worth it, and then the credits rolled and I was let down.They tried too hard to be climactic, suspenseful, and cool; and unfortunately, failed miserably.I was sorry I saw this movie.

Other than that it's the same franchise Paul Anderson murdered. oh and main character is a guy but that's because Paul didn't make this one, if he had it would've been an overly hot supermodel chick as the hero -_-. Don't get me wrong it's a fun movie to watch because the blood and gore is just plain ridiculous, but in these movies, if you want it to be surprising, you have to develop a bond with characters to the audience AND THEN KILL THEM IN A HUNDRED DIFFERENT WAYS. Although The ""Predalien"" as they called it looked fierce, it's battle with ""Wolf"" (Predator) could've been a million times better and as always they have the lead Predator for some odd reason take off his mask (every Predator/Predator involving movie does this), oh yeah and a Deus Ex Machina ending with a nuclear explosion killing all life.

615,Pelintra02,Was this the Movie I Paid to See?,4,18 January 2008,"Alien Vs. Predator Requiem promises to pit two of sci-fi's most iconic monsters together in a so called ""ultimate showdown"", this showdown however will have to wait till next time as here, the audience is treated to a conventional (in the worst use of the term) teenage romance movie(thanks again Shane Salerno) It was nice to see that the Brothers Strause had some good intentions for this film but most of these intension's can only be seen in the preproduction still's, as most of the films second and third acts are shot with a blue filter in heavy rain fall, hence your likely to have a hard time identifying just exactly what your suppose to be scared of.One of Requiems worst faults is not the acting, as some may lead you to believe (although there opinion is just as valid as mine) These franchises never really did need strong supporting casts as long as the protagonists were likable (with the exception of the brilliant Mrs Sigourney Weaver) , the fault lies in the Straus's lack of experience in trying to create suspense. They want to make a James Cameron Aliens movie, but whilst Cameron has the experience to make the action genre pay off, the brothers cant capture any sort of tension when necessary. In fact the most hilarious thing I could say about this movie is that the most tension created by any character is by the homeless man who moves languidly out of the towns sewage system towards the sheriff in the films first act.Now these two directors show potential, mainly in the action sequences involving the towns electricity plant. These scenes do not evoke tension but they contain am inspired energy that its predecessor never was able to conjure up (nor most of this films scenes for the most part) But ultimately the writing is on the wall here, unlike Alien 3 and Predator 2, sequels that have now found there audiences and greater praise over time, Requiem is one sorry teenage action flick that will hopefully be forgotten as never being part of these once great science fiction franchises.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
616,aidanok,Stay Away From This Abomination,1,3 January 2019,"This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I actually liked the original AvP, so if I hate this, you know it's bad. You can't see what's even happening most of the movie because the lighting is awful. To me, the plotline with the Predalien made absolutely 0 sense, and I lost brain cells watching the ending. It is more gory than AvP. That's about the only good thing about this movie.

Much better than the rubbish that was Alien Resurrection, which I never thought could be beaten to 'worst Alien film ever', but somehow AVP Requiem manages that.A slasher/ b-movie with unnecessary gore and shock tactics which looks cheap and awful. The cast from a 'Nightmare on Elm Street' or 'Scary Movie' film seem to have been hired and it just doesn't work. Most of the time you can't see what's going on and when you can see it you wish you hadn't.I don't really mind gore but I don't want to see a chest bursting scene with a child, and I definitely don't want to see THAT maternity ward scene. My wife has seen all of the Alien films with me but when that scene happened she just got up and walked out of the room.This film didn't just disappoint me, it OFFENDED me.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

I actually enjoyed the first AVP, even if the story was a bit weak, so I had high hopes going into this one.Ultimately I thought it started out with some potential, but then flopped big time.***Extra Spoiler warning. I'll be outlining a big chunk of the plot, so if you don't want to know, stop reading now.I thought they started out fairly strong, continuing from the finishing scene of AVP. Hybrid alien pops out, takes out a few predators and crashes an escape pod on earth. A few of the crawlies happen to be on the pod and escape into the forest. They find some humans and jump on their faces. Distress signal gets sent out to the Predator planet and one of them comes to save the day. Okay, not a bad start.Four aliens, one hybrid, one predator. Not bad odds. Could be some good action.Then everything falls apart.All of a sudden, there's more aliens popping out all over the place. Four out of one person. WHAT? The scenes are for the most part waaay too dark, so instead of seeing the creatures at all, your stuck trying to pick them out of the shadows. The fight scenes are not well constructed and you have a hard time seeing what is doing what. The acting and special effects are pretty much non existent. There's bunch minor plots involving teenagers, a cop, an ex con and a military family, but none of them are explained or explored well so you don't really care when any of them bites the dust. I have to admit, by the end of the film I was pretty much hoping that they all wound up dead.As a last note, I felt they went a little to far when they had the child be a host for one of the aliens. However, they obliterated that a little later in the hospital. I understand wanting to show the gruesomeness of the aliens, but they took it too far.The film could have been so much better than it was. Even better lighting and fight construction without altering the story could have made it more enjoyable to watch.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Probably the missing scene of the movie : the Predator with hanging glanders wanting to return home.The whole movie is even not funny, just boring. You have a lot of ""deja-vu"" scenes with aliens snorting humans before killing them, a predator (probably named George Clooney) practicing self surgery...

I understand the movie making process, and appreciate top notch efforts like this one.... my hat is off to the Struass Brothers for having the guts to make this film...... forget about all the negative reviews.... those people are NOT fans, and DO NOT understand the movie making process..... THIS film IS ACTION, FUN, EXCITING, and you leave the theater feeling good about the state of Sci-fi..... with the recent glut of terrible movies, ALIENS VS PREDATOR R, is just a plain, refreshing BREATH OF FRESH AIR!!If you are criticizing this movie.... then that shows me that you are not really understanding the writing and production process for films..... With a franchise this popular (both Aliens and Predator franchises, and them now combined), everyone is going to have expectations...... but those expectations should be tempered with a realistic look at what is possible for a franchise such as this....I bet any amount of money, that the SAME people who are bitching and complaining about 'this, that, and the other', pertaining to AVP:R.... are the very SAME ones who would be bitching and complaining if the movie had some CHEESEBAG story, and if the movie tried to add 'depth' to the 'Alien' and 'Predator' characters.... Guess WHAT?!? What?... you say? The truth is, you already know the characters of the 'Aliens' and the 'Predators'.... you did NOT go to the theater for the Aliens and Predators to sit down and have a conversation over tea..... you went to see ACTION (which the movie provided) and LOTS AND LOTS of Aliens and a Predator On screen (looking AWESOME as ever) SO..... my question is.....WHY?? WHY WHY WHY are you complaining about this movie??? You would have hated it otherwise, so why complain about what IS there? Your complaints are only going to hamper the production of a third film in the series..... AND possibly hamper the possibility that there will EVER be another release in the actual 'ALIENS' or 'PREDATOR' series of films.....SO, stop the complaining and APPRECIATE what you ACTUALLY HAVE in front of you.... which is 1. AN AWESOME FILM with what you REALLY WANTED TO SEE (onscreen action with your favorite characters looking MORE AWESOME THAN EVER) 2. A well done film that does a very good job of giving you the action YOU wanted to see....3. A film that could have been A COMPLETE disaster if ANYONE ELSE worked on it, who did NOT have such a passion for the 'ALIENS' and 'PREDATOR' characters (only someone who understands the characters THIS much could have made this film)......4. A DAMN fine film, with AWESOME visuals, and a well produced and tastefully directed FILM....GO SEE AVP:R!! It is MORE than worth it, in my opinion!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
621,grant_316,Seen it all before...,3,24 June 2008,"A long time fan of both franchises, I awaited this latest entry in the series with eagerness; the idea of a true Alien/Predator hybrid introduced at the end of AvP seemed to open up so many unexplored avenues.What I got was a movie with no plot line, 2-dimensional (at best) characters and a completely predictable progression - as soon as it became apparent that the military had no intention of evacuating anybody, for example, I knew the name 'Yutani' was on its way, having had 'Weyland' in AvP.I think it would actually be possible to remake this entire movie at home simply by stitching together scenes from the first four Alien films, with a few bits from Predator and Predator 2 interspersed here-and-there. There was nothing unexpected and nothing original - for the love of God, they even re-used the name Dallas! Even the ""PredAlien"" turned out to be a giant waste of space.If you're an avid fan of the two genres and really must have it to complete your collection, buy it, watch it without expectations and accept it for what it is.

I myself am a huge fan of the original Alien movies (mainly 1 and 2). I didn't care much for Predator and absolutely hated Predator 2. I as a young film critic was very disappointed with this lame excuse for a film. The ending as well, was just stupid. The possibility of the 4 characters surviving is 0.

624,renatoforestieri,Another Poorly Written Script!,5,26 December 2007,"After the disappointment of AVP I had hoped that this sequel would be made by someone with a brain. It was a fool's dream as this one had an even weaker plot than the first. If the first one had been honestly promoted as an initiation of young Preds I would have walked away satisfied with the movie but....!AVP-R had far more action than AVP but without an intelligent script it looses too much. The fans blamed Paul Anderson for making the first one suck but unless he wrote the promos it wasn't totally his fault.AVP was supposed to be a war between Aliens and Predators and this is where the disappointment lay. We went to see a war and only saw an initiation. AVP-R was supposed to be about another war between Aliens and Predators and again the promoters fooled us!What happened to the good old days when the script contained information that explained what the movie was about. These AVP scripts have more holes in them than a swiss cheese. Why can't the writers explain what is going on and why! This is a movie I would like to see again if only to see if I can find ""clues"" to the plot. Otherwise I just give it a 5 out of 10. Five points for action. No points for storyline.I have read a large number of IMDb revues and I am wondering if I am the only one who noticed that the dead Predator from AVP was no longer on the original ship. When the Predators claimed their fallen comrad we saw hundreds of Predators on a huge ship. At the start of AVP-R the dead Predator seems to be on a smaller ship manned by only 2 Predators. Was this dead Predator really placed on a smaller ship or did the hybrid wipe out the entire army of Predators that watched the initiation in AVP?Hopefully if they make a third film they will give the project to someone who isn't afraid to show 2 Predators (or hopefully more) in full blown-out battle with Aliens. Why don't they copy the battle methods of the Lord of The Rings. Those battles were huge!I guess what really bothers me is how modern day film makers insult the intelligence of the fans. They know we are waiting for the film's release but feel they have to ""trick"" us with phony advertising. Welcome to the modern world of movie making!I will probably see this movie again but in reality I see it more as a scripted video game than a film.

The lighting in this movie was horrible, I had a heck of time seeing details in the creatures. Way too much time focusing on the humans. Hard to believe the last good Predator or Alien movie was made in the 1980s. This movie also gets caught up in the prequel jinx. Since we knew Sigourney and her Nostromo crew never heard of the Alien, it was pretty obvious everyone human was going to die or disappear in a massive cover-up. What really ticked me off, was most of the town's citizens fled so the killings were minimized. The Pred-Alien was cool, but dreadlocks? I thought it was bizarre how the Pred-Alien impregnated its victims with that mouth to mouth regurgitation.

Femme fa tales, APC driving, incompetent officers, healing scenes, skinning people, they did not forget a one. If you are going to bother to do that, why not go all the way? It could have been done more effectively. They mention the Company at the end, but why not name some characters; Ripley, Apone, Dutch, Wesley, Bishop, Vasquez, etc? They were just too subtle, I wanted to cheer, ""Hell yeah"" when someone said ""Game Over, man,"" albeit in some unrelated context. Or ""Let go of her you BITCH.""

He probably could've done a better job; at least then we might have seen some naked women or something. As it stands, the best part of this movie is 1) the smokin' hot blonde (Kristen Hager), and 2) seeing Kristen Hager get cut in half by the spinny blade thing.

It's fun and fast paced and gets the job done for what it sets out to do and that is simply entertain you.After a dreadful AvP, this movie picks up the pieces and actually has some fun. The characters, though underwritten, are decent enough and don't get on your nerves. I really liked the relationship between Dallas and Ricky. The acting was a little above TV quality but again it didn't distract and bother me to much.The main character of the film is the predator that has come to clean up the mess. I really liked this predator and he truly had some iconic moments. The sewer scene was very well done. It's not perfect though but with a standard B movie storyline that this has I wasn't expecting it to be. I will agree with a lot of the films critics who complain about the film's lack of suspense. And just what was up with the Predalien's life cycle? Visually it was cool but it makes no sense after repeated viewings and how it fits into the alien life cycle that has come before it. Also, I liked the fight scenes but they could've been longer and had more suspense to them as well. It was obvious from the get go that the lone predator Wolf was going to clean house.In the end though I'm still waiting for the dream AvP.

Nothing.Honestly, I don't even feel like talking about the retarded plot or the equally minute brains 9/10ths of the characters in this movie housed. Just STAY AWAY!

I know that there are PLENTY of people out there that love aliens and want them to win.. To which i'm going to say, the ending sucked. I wont tell you how, if you didn't see it, but it was dumb.My big problem with the movie was that in my love of the Predator, he did not act like his species. There were many instances where people holding weapons should have been killed but were not. What's that about? As far as i know, unless he was presently engaged with the alien, they would have died. If not right away, then soon after. Why did this change? Also, the fact that the aliens and the predators looked so similar in the dark (one being minus a tail) was not helpful with the movie being so dark. I wasn't sure what was going on through most of the fight scenes.And my very last gripe about this movie is this: are there ONLY 4 buildings in this town? Because apparently the aliens (and their multitudes) were only interested in the hospital, the gun store (or whatever it was), the sewers, the restaurant & the school. I have a hard time believing that the main characters interacted with the predator so much yet he was busy chasing the multitudes of aliens. What?

I think it was a trick from the production for that we cant really notice how bad this was.Major ERRORS:-Alien creatures looks more stupid than ever.-You don't even get to care about the characters that are killed.-Predator was there for aliens, why would he skin alive a cop?-Us army gets raped in 2 minutes, how can some poor civilians gets to kill half a duzen of aliens still?? this was FUN.Even in AvP 1 they still get the battle beetween alien and predator quite tough.. but now predator is like superman versus those poor aliens..I mean this still gets a 5, because you still get to see a few minutes of some great Predator and Alien pictures...

641,volhome,In the Townfolks Shoes,10,30 December 2007,"Hearing some of the negative quotes and reviews, we nearly skipped the movie until it was available on DVD. Well that would have been a mistake. For a change, it felt like we got a similar feel for characters that we did in the original Alien (and since I am old enough to have seen that at its original release, it has been easy to follow the entire franchise pair). We got to know some characters a little, and they died. We got to know some characters a lot, and they died. We got to know some characters, and they lived. The mayhem was overwhelming, and just what it would be during an infestation by Aliens. Throw in the Predator for cleanup measure, and it magnifies the Wow factor by ten. As with every movie, I expect license to be taken from prior franchisees. And I don't have to have perfect storyline flow from one source to the next. As long as there are no major screw-ups, we charge ahead like was done here. Full steam, and available for future sequels. Before you see the movie, take some time to try to figure out what it would be like in your town if this really happened. This is one glimpse in that window. Kudos to the entire team.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
642,john_wasula,What were they thinking?!!!,1,2 January 2008,"After seeing a good majority of positive comments on this film here at IMDb I have to wonder if I saw the same movie that they did. This was a pretty bad movie as far as plots go. It wasn't suspenseful and it didn't have you rooting for any one side. I consider myself a fan of the franchise. One of my favorite movies is AVP probably because the story was fairly believable and interesting. AVPR doesn't even come close to being original and, sadly, it tries to replicate many scenes from previous movies, i.e.: injured Predator, swimming Alien, Alien hive at the hospital. Why not take a chance and do something different that will make your mark on the franchise? I think they tried introducing a few new Predator weapons but they didn't make an impact (pun intended?) I should have waited for it to come out on DVD. Now I can just say that I've watched it and I don't have to rent it...Ever!!!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
643,jadelotuz,This is OK.,5,3 February 2008,"Im a fan of the Alien and Predator franchise. When I first read about an Alien Vs Predator Movie (the first) I was very hopeful, since I've read many of the Comics around this subject, in fact, its from the Comic books that this AvP idea was originated, almost - An Alien Head did actually show up in the Predator ship in the Predator 2 movie, that was a fun and cool thing to do back in the 80s, and still is :) It was really cool, and it was that what sparked the idea of Aliens vs Predators.Avp 1 molested a Comic manuscript, by changing the setting from a more chronologically correct place with the Alien Movies. In other words, in the future, out in space, but on a Colony (a small prospering colony on a planet out in space). This was sad ... But anyhow. I was a bit disappointed.So when this came, I was a bit careful, and didn't think much of it at all. The Details of what was good or bad I leave to the other reviewers here, or to the viewer (as taste is diverse). But the Aliens, and Predator, and their Tech looks really good, a bit murky from time to time. And the who movie is a bit Easy-chewed. It had the ""foundation"" to be better, but ended up with not being any scary, tense or traumatizing (like the first one :). But it was somewhat enjoyable. Cant really place it, but it was nice to see the Aliens and The Predator running around again.The R rating. Well, We where younger and more naive back then, so i guess that stuff changes over time. But this one doesn't really know where it stands. The setting, feeling, action and so on often smells a bit Teenage, Highschool, American Dream scenario horror flick, and therefore cant be taken seriously, but there are a lot of blood? and there are some rather nasty (or cool) scenes with dead people and bits of dead people. But i guess it got an R rating cause it has no nudity? (Blood is OK, a naked breast OH MY GOD! ...) It has no nudity, OK give it an R! or something.Anyway! o don't want to blurb about the plot, story or acting. Many have already noted many things about this ... their bad or just doesn't exist ;) But there are many references to the old series.** SPOILER WARNING ** (dont read this last thingie)Finally! Many reviewers here have noted that the movie ends as if it should have a Sequell, well I didn't really feel that. I guess they have referred to the Case with the Predator weapon, and the Guy talking to a mystical Asian Lady called Yutani. Well I just see it as a connection to the Alien Movies! The Big bad company that sent Nostromo and the whole crew to LV4 (the planet) in the first Alien movie, and later shipped the expendable marines to the colony, and that owned the prison in Alien3, And finally experimented on the Aliens in Alien4, was the company of ""Wayland Yutani""! got it? Yutani? thats how they got so big! they had an Predator GUN! ;)",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
644,ricepicker84015,2 for effort!!,2,17 April 2008,My friends and I are fans of aliens and predator.(note me not say VS) I like it when they were separate. Now that they have combined the two they think that its going to be the most amazing thing in the world. but I will tell you now its not. all it was it just one predator VS a crap load of Aliens with MINDLESS HUMANS!! running around with their heads cut off being kill just for the heck of it. I have to admit the main girl was quite hot until lost half her body. I didn't like that part. but meh WHY Don't THEY JUST MAKE A MOVIE WHERE THE ALIENS JUST INVADE THE PREDATOR HOME WORLD AND MAKE SOME 2 HOUR BLOOD AND GUTS WAR BETWEEN THE TWO!!!!!!! OR MAKE A GAME LIKE THAT. SO THAT PEOPLE COULD GET NO STOP KILLING!!!!,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
645,oskar-jungell,"If you're a fan, you'll like it!",8,28 April 2008,"MY EXPERIENCE: I was expecting something in the lines of the first AvP movie, or ""Alien: resurrection"". And I've heard that this movie had a much smaller budget than the first AvP movie. With this in mind I watched the movie.I was thrilled! This is one of the best monster movies that I've ever seen! Sure, the CGI ain't the best I've seen, in fact, it's quite poor. But the rest of the film is just brilliant! It's a genuine popcorn-movie.If you're like me and though that ""Aliens"" and ""Predator 2"" was the best movies in the two series, you WILL love this movie!They filled it to the fullest with blood, guts and monsters from outer space!THE PLOT: Sure, the plot ain't all that good, but who cares? You don't watch this kind of film for the plot, you watch it for the cool monsters and the action!It was a bold move, making the aliens come to earth. At first I was skeptical but it turned out to work really well. And let's face it, we all wanted it to happen sooner or later!So all in all, the plot does what it's supposed to, it brings the action!THE CHARACTERS: The human characters are quite believable and has more depth than the usual action, this brings a whole new level to the beloved series.Sure, the reactions and decisions they make sometimes seems a little strange, but I don't mind sense it's not a drama film.The predator in the film doesn't have nearly as much personal style as the original ones did. But it doesn't ruin the movie, it just cut's back on the overall awesomeness.The Aliens are quite classic, they behave pretty much as I suspected they would do in an open enviorment. From what I can tell they are based on the aliens from the second film in the series, it even looks like it's the same costumes, which is awesome. They bring back some of the old stuff but also leaves some of it behind for the new stuff.This installment in the series is by far the one with the most blood and guts. It's like a mix of Alens (Alien 2), AvP and a tad of Gilmore Girls. In other words, it's an awesome movie with plenty of action, blood, alien guts, romance, explosions, family issues, unexpected death and some mildly bad special effects.I LOVE IT.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
646,GraveDigerGrace,One Word.. Excellent!,10,23 May 2008,"This Movie was not as good as the First Alien VS Predator but it contained more gore, action and aliens.I thought that even though there isn't much of a story to the film, i thought that it was as gross as the first, as action filled as the first, and completely alien filled. i love that the predators aren't out to kill humans but to sometimes help them. The predators eliminates the aliens in order to gain themselves food, power and in the human's case, safety. I bought this movie and i would never think of renting it...you must buy it. But, there are a few cons for this film. They are; it's filmed in the dark too much. It doesn't contain much of a story plot, and too many of the characters survive. Normally in a film, only 1 or 2 characters survive but in this case, about 4 or 5 survive.But i still thought this movie was excellent!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
647,stevediamond70,Atrocious Film,1,25 May 2008,"I'll give most films an open mind and judge them on their own merit but this film was diabolically bad. There is pretty much no story and the action doesn't seem to flow from one scene to the next. The lighting is shockingly bad and for the majority of the film you're almost watching a black screen. Characters are completely 2D with no depth which is just as well cos the film is just - lets see someones face (well as best as the near black screen will allow), have them scream and move a silouhette in a slashing fashion across the screen, then repeat this 15 second scene over and over again.Its a very lazy film by directors that had no interest in the subject matter and believe their audience to be utter morons. Very probably one of the WORST movies of all time. You'll not be missing out if you don't see this film.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
648,vinz990,a good movie,10,7 July 2008,"i don't understand why there are many bad reviews for this movie.After reading all the comments i found that the main reasons for the failure of this movie are 1 - bad acting 2 - no proper story 3 - no reputed actors 4 - there was darkness 5 - predator was like a superman killing all the aliens .The only problem that i found after watching this movie was ""darkness"" and bad acting in very few scenes.When a fan of alien vs predator enters into a theater he/she expect to watch violent scenes,and in this movie the number of such scenes are maximum.In a movie like this it is obvious that the only thing which matters is the battle between alien and predator etc but if one wants to see a movie which has a proper story, good acting etc then i recommend him to watch other movies . After watching the first avp i was very disappointed because throughout the movie ,aliens had an upper hand.They were very powerful such that one alien killed two predators and the third predator killed only a few aliens .i.e most of the aliens were killed in that explosion. Being a fan predator i couldn't accept that movie.Predators are very powerful hunters and their technology is far more advanced than the humans.That is what we can understand from the predator movies. So the first alien vs predator was a huge disappointment for me.But in the second movie the predator is very powerful and he kills many aliens. Of course the concept of one predator was disappointing.I am not saying that the aliens are not powerful.It is only because of the technology that the predator succeeds, otherwise both aliens and predators are equal in terms of power.That is why the predator,in this movie,is powerful and keeps on killing aliens.According to me the movie was good in fact.Anyway it was brilliant than the first part",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
649,ZavalaIzzy,Not a classic but a very good attempt!,7,18 April 2009,I first seen this film back in December of 2008. I was surprised at how many young people there were from ages 6 to 15. The film opens perfectly right were the first film left off. I like how the film gets right to the point and doesn't give a really bad or long backstory. The first main character to be introduced is dallace played by STEVEN PASQUALE. Then Sheriff Moralas played by JOHN ORTIZ. both characters seem to go back a long way. Then Ricky and Jesse are introduced played by JOHNNY LEWIS and KRISTEN HAGER. This is were the film starts to get a little...Different. Teenagers and AVP are not a very good mix even if One of them is a super Hot Girl. And finally Kelly Played by REKIO AYLSWORTH.The film overall lacks Originalaty. The film is pretty mutch predictable with a few but not very good shocking gasps along the way. The deaths are all great and gory. Definitely the Goriest of the entiere series. This film truly earns it's R Rating. The fight scenes were very good compared to AVP and the New hybrid is a great additon to the film. But as the credits came up it kept me asking for more. I greatly await another AVP film! Story 8/10 Acting 6/10 i'v seen kids act better than this. Action 8/10 Gore 10/10 Suspense 5/10Overall 7.5/10,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Although I believe that they should stop making these movies before it makes people forget the originals that inspired these awful AVP films, I did get a few good laughs out of the movie. Although I dislike the idea of coming onto this website to do nothing but bash creative people who take a chance, I have a hard time holding back when these same people don't even have to come up with an original story line but then still can't deliver on a decent plot.

652,Skull_Face,"AVPR is a poorly written, paint by numbers slasher.",5,9 April 2011,"Alien vs Predator: Requiem starts off with little promise, harboring two franchises on its back that had, by 2008, began limping towards their bitter end. Little is done on behalf of AVPR to hamper this destruction. The movie is as plain and horrid as a bottom of the bottom Roger Corman production. B Movie leftovers from formerly classic films. Set inside a small town, USA, AVPR tells the story of two iconic movie monsters engaging in a battle that spills over onto the plate of humanity. A big issue here may be the small town setting, although the problems in the script tend to multiply as the movie piddles on. The characters, some of which include a pizza boy, one timid sheriff, and a few hobos, are so underwhelming that it is difficult to find footing along with them. A story must be told through the eyes of the characters. This is how an audience connects to a film. Yet here, every face fails to reach a flavor that is beyond vanilla. Decent gore and special FX earn AVPR a few points. Nostalgia carries the rest.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
653,quinnburroughs,Very Cool,7,1 February 2010,"I saw AVP-R on Christmas the day that it came out. I'm a huge fan of all of the Alien and Predator Films, including AVP. After seeing AVP-R, I was very satisfied. I was one of those people that wasn't looking for a great story, but rather to see the Aliens and the Predators once again in an epic bloody battle. If this is what your looking for then you'll most likely enjoy this movie. If you're going in to expect grade A acting and a fantastic plot, then you will most likely not like this movie. The Predator looked amazing, a lot like how he looked in the original films. Same with the Alien, looked just like how it did in ALIENS. I give this movie a 7-10 mainly because it's just so damn dark during the movie. And i don't mean dark as in scary, freaky dark. I mean you can't see what the hells happening. Other than that, good movie. I strongly recommend it to any die hard ALIEN and PREDATOR fans.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
654,infernis,plain awful,1,12 April 2008,"It's pretty much a disgrace to the alien & predator movies. Just like the first AVP movie, it should have never been made. These directors claim to be fans of the alien franchise, yet when looking at this movie it's like they've never even seen them, or completely missed the point of what made them so successful. How embarrassing for a director to put something out like this. Nice job reducing these popular names to a hollow slasher. Who is green-lighting these things? The only thing it tells me is that movie studios just hope the name of the movie will be enough to make it popular, leeching of the success of Alien(s) and Predator. Just like Alien 3 & 4 and AVP, I'll just pretend they never happened. The only two people that should be allowed to make alien movies are Ridley Scott and James Cameron.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
655,mofoto22,This movie makes my soul itch.,2,25 December 2007,"I rated this movie with two stars because there are about two things I enjoyed about the movie, and about eight thousand things that I did not. I guess I'll start with the ""redeeming qualities."" First, it's fairly suspenseful, and you keep waiting for a really good fight scene or to see what kind of fight the Predator and the Predator/Alien will have(but are ultimately disappointed). Second, I really enjoyed the music that was from the original Predator movie, a John McTiernan film which was both suspenseful AND rewarding.There were too many people(with lame cliché story lines) in this movie, and too many aliens. Okay, lets forget for a minute that the Predator/Alien combo emerges from the dead Predator at the beginning and before the ship leaves Earth's orbit grows up into a full grown cross-breed and kills the ONLY TWO Predators on the ship. They send a distress signal to their home planet... and somehow in their infinite wisdom and experience they only send ONE Predator to clean up the mess. ONLY ONE? This isn't the Highlander, make the movie make sense, why don't you? It would have been much better with two or three. The movie was also too dark and close up indistinguishable scenes abounded. Does Colorado not have electricity for lights? Oh, wait, the aliens do destroy a power plant for no apparent reason. And there are just random aliens that come out of nowhere in random sections of this small town with only two sheriff's which somehow also has a hospital. That ends up being the culmination of the alien breeding as the Predator/Alien somehow is also a queen and can impregnate very pregnant women and make their babies turn into several aliens, that somehow are regular aliens and not cross-breeds like the one they are spawned from. Listen, I don't like bitchy pregnant women either, but I still thought this part of the movie was awful and unnecessarily horrible. Yeah, shock value is cool sometimes, but I feel this is a little too over the top.In the end it's like they didn't know how to end the movie, so all of a sudden there is this random suit on a plane who knows about the whole thing who decides to nuke the whole area. Oh, Kay. But why bother even letting the poorly developed characters live through the nuking? And somehow the army is RIGHT THERE when they crash land, and were just waiting outside this small clearing that the helicopter didn't even make any marks in, didn't help the people who survived and might be hurt until they surprise them and take away their guns. I'm also probably one of the few people who hasn't followed all of the Aliens movies because lets face it, the only good ones were the first two, so when the third one sucked, I kind of moved on, and somewhere in there was Winona Ryder? So, anyway, the ending of this movie... not so much. I don't like where this might be going, and though I'll probably go see the next installment, my expectations have been lowered substantially. So much more to complain about, so little time and a great unwillingness to think about this anymore.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

657,NonSequitur-1,"The Good, The Bad and the Unforgivable",3,27 December 2007,"So, to start off, I'll admit that I'm a major fan of the originals... Alien/Aliens/Alien 3 and Predator/Predator 2. Those have been some of my favourite movies since I was a wee thing, and like many other fans, they will always be. That's why I'm going to spend the next 20 minutes typing up something that most of you would consider a waste of time... but I just would like to put my opinion out there... cause I can. Alien: Resurrection was the first real misstep for the series. While it was still entertaining, there were major problems with it - it's story took away from the films that came before it, and in the end, became a silly, self-parody rather than a moody, gritty science-fiction/horror/action/thriller that made the first outings in both series so memorable. AvP, on the other hand, was simply a turd. It broke so many rules established in the previous entries. It was watered down and turned into a kiddie flick. The script was ridiculous and share no continuity with the other films. The effects, while occasionally interesting, were on the whole uninspiring. The pace was weak, and the creatures were treated disrespectfully... It was just a major disappointment after waiting for so many years. Better stories existed in both the games and the comics, yet for some reason Fox felt it wasn't worth the effort to make something amazing and just churned out any old thing to get kid's asses in the seats. As for AvP:R, I had zero expectations, yet still walked out disappointed. Although it fixed a few of the problems with the first entry in the AvP series, it created a whole bunch of it's own. To narrow them down into categories. THE GREAT: - Finally, back to an R-Rating with gore - Not so much reliance on CGI - No Paul WS Anderson THE GOOD: - The Predator looked much better, slimmer and more graceful this time around, although the mouth still was kinda messed up - No fear of being nasty, and maybe even controversial - as evidenced by the baby/pregnant woman scenes - Some nice music that reminds you of the original films - Good sound design - The double head-shot THE BAD - The Predalien looked dorky and top-heavy. The way it was filmed gave it no presence or menace whatsoever - Too dark, the film needed to be lit more tactfully - Direction was bland - there were no real ""wow"" moments - The action, while better than what we got in the first AvP, is still filmed in that awful shaky cam with fast cutting techniques that take away the impact of what is happening - The shot of the Predator home planet, while it looked kind of cool, was completely unnecessary, removing more of the mystery that made the Predators so interesting in the first place - Not enough gore - The Predalien's ability to ""reproduce"" is vague and makes very little sense when taken into consideration with the alien life cycle - Bad dialogue - Too much posing by the Predator - The Predator's new equipment was uninteresting to say the least - The Predator skins a guy and hangs him from a tree while trying to cover up evidence of strange goings on? - Still no space marines - Too many ideas re-used under the guise of ""homage"" and executed in a much weaker fashion than they were originally - The fact that the creatures looked better in their 80's incarnations is strange and indicates this movie needed a bigger budget - A definite ""direct-to-video"" feel about the whole affair THE UNFORGIVABLE - Terrible script, boring setting - No continuity with the previous entries in the series - Totally destroys the point that the original ""Alien"" film made about the Nostromo crew being the first humans to ever come in contact with the Alien species - The Aliens in this film are pathetic, and are a far cry from what we learned about them from the previous films - The fact that it's set on Earth, while it can be blamed on the first AvP, takes away so much from ""Alien"" and Ripley's quest to prevent the species ever making it's way to human civilisation - the whole thing just diminishes the menace and threat posed by these creatures, thus making them less interesting and terrifying - No characters, just a bunch of clichés that walked on screen and then promptly died - The awful ""teen-movie"" scenes - they embarrassed me to even be sitting there watching them - The alien life-cycle is still too fast - Stupid cliffhanger ending that makes as much sense as Bishop being alive in 2004, which is... not at all. - They showed everything good in the film in the red-band trailer, resulting in no tension.All in all... Watch it if you must, but don't expect it to reach the potential AvP really has.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

659,flangeripper,Black Screen syndrome,2,23 September 2012,"Do you love staring at a black screen? Have you just spent loads of money on a very expensive top of the range TV but Have decided that you don't want to see any colours on it? If yes then this film is for you. Two things have happened in this genre of movie in recent years. The first thing is that the special effects have to be bigger and better than every before with bigger explosions and monsters. The second thing is that the films become darker. By darker I mean the screen is blacker. Everything shot at night time with very little light. This film excels on both of these counts. Around 80% of the film is simply a black screen. This is because the rather convenient power cut at the electricity station which throws the town into moody darkness. The darkness is supposed to make it scary and add suspense. The problem is that it is just too dark. It is impossible to watch this film in daytime unless you have black out curtains. You just cant see what is going on. A lot of new films are like this. the original Alien film and Predator film were both shot in good lighting. You could see the set and the scenery very clearly, and yet both of them had more atmosphere than this black fest film. Stop making films in the dark. Some of us want to see the set. The other point is the special effects. Even though everything is dark, you still get to see too much of the aliens and the predator. The CGI guys can't resist showing you what they can do. So even though the screen is mostly black, in the moments of light you still see more of the aliens and the predator than the original films, and because of the lack of suspense and the extremely poor, predictable story line, you are never scared by the monsters. Just bored by them. Please stop making these films. Leave us with the memories of the original films and stop trying to make profit on their ideas with this lame, crap film. I'm going to watch a film which has lights in it now so I can see what is going on.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
660,brannentaylor,Just terrible - wait until 2 am when there's NOTHING on TV.,1,3 January 2008,"Warning - Contains spoiler.I Love Alien - Alien2 is one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever, period.If you're a fan of these the Alien and Predator movies - don't go see this one. Don't reward the schmucks that wrote this movie and produced it for totally screwing with the Alien morphology - more later.Now for the spoilers ...Hint - if you're writing a Science Fiction movie - for it to be considered ""good"" by Science Fiction fans, it has to have some plausible science - meaning if something deviates from the science before, it should be explained. Not AVPR though ... so the main Predator is dead, and the Predators with their ""heat vision"" which can basically see through things - can't see the little Alien ""baby"" inside the body of their fallen leader?!?! Then it pops out and basically starts killing everyone on the Predator ship - a stretch. It crashes in Colorado - never mind that the earth is +70% covered by water, we need some interaction with live humans to make a movie. So, the ship crashed and a surviving Predator phones home for help.Umm, OK - I guess they couldn't call before the ship crashes, before everyone gets impregnated or killed. Then, I guess he dies before he can set off a little nuke and wrap up the movie neatly and early. So the Alien face suckers escape and start munching on local hunters, home less people living in huge storm sewers in the middle of the woods in Colorado ? Let me interrupt - I live in a major metropolitan city - in a suburb actually - and I've never seen Storm sewers that size. But in the woods, in the mountains, in Colorado? Don't sewers have to be more or less horizontal, isn't this a problem with say tall Rocky Mountains? Whatever - jeez.So, at some point - I don't even remember when, we finally meet up with the main Alien - who has turned into a half Alien, half Predator! Funny, that hasn't happened in ALL the other Alien movies, with the exception of when some genetic experimentation was going on. I'm sorry, stupid, insulting to the whole story arch.Back on Predator home world, ONE Predator gets the call and sets off towards Earth!?!? I thought it was cool in AVP1 when a bunch of them show up and pick up their comrades. I guess those guys don't deserve the same or better. So, does it make sense that one of their ships gets taken out and they send ONE guy? And he shows up and has to scavenge weapons from the downed ship? They don't have some cool killer weapons back on Predator home world?!?!? So, the new Predator shows up and grabs some special dissolving goo - anything he pours it on dissolves to nothing - sounds like a pretty kick A$$ weapon - but he just carries it around in a jar. If he was really interested in erasing all traces of Alien activity, why not just nuke the whole town and get it over with, but that would end the movie before we're forced to sit through it.The main Alien (hybrid) finds a hospital and decides to set up a nursery and regurgitate eggs into pregnant women's mouths - sort of a little Alien incubator. Whatever - they don't explain it, and it's like a 10 second scene that everyone including me forgets about.One of the main characters - honestly, I didn't even care enough to remember her character name - is a returning Iraq vet. So, of course she knows how to shoot everything, drive a Striker vehicle, oh and she can fly a helicopter too. She of course has to live.Finally the National Guard gets called in to help save the town from the Aliens - but I guess they were all deployed to Iraq, because only a Striker and a couple of Humvees show up - maybe about 10 National Guards - and they last about 10 seconds - a bunch of shooting over the radio - nothing like the shoot out with the space Marines in Alien2.So everyone jumps in the Striker which our Heroine, Ms. Iraq Vet gives a look like, ""of course I can drive this, I'm a Vet"". They call the National Guard and the Cancer Man from the X-Files is on the other end of the radio (not the same actor, but the stereotypical Government man in the suit who's in charge of covering up Aliens). So, of course they're going to nuke the town (which they should have done 90 minutes ago) and Mr. Cover-up wants to send them to ground zero, but our heroes want to go find a helicopter because they have a vet who can drive a striker which means she can also fly a helicopter.So, the smart people get in the helicopter and take off and fly away just as the town finally gets nuked. They crash, and a bunch of special forces find them. Do they kill them to complete the cover up? No, why do anything that makes sense now!?!? They all live happily ever after.Meanwhile, back in cover up land, they walk up with Predator kick A$$ gun, and say something stupid about the world not being ready for this. Well, duh. Thank goodness we have the cover up man to protect us from what we don't need to know, and set up AVP3.If it has the same writer, director, or producer - count me out. I'd like my $10 back, and 90 minutes of my life. What a waste.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
661,abbas_ff,Best Alien or Predator movie yet ... why ? Reason Follows,8,4 February 2008,"Many people seem to be criticizing this movie .... hmmm i wonder why .. There was a time when those who saw Terminator 1 first and later on Terminator 2 later on preferred T-1 more... generally because T-1 was a totally new concept and a story line...Same can be said for AVP-R. For me at least it was my money's worth because as a hard core Predator fan I want to see "" PREDATOR "" in action and thats all .. I for one don't care about the story line or the minor flaws as long as I get to see some good clear fights which AVP-R delivered. There was a lot of coverage on both Alien and Predator. The weapons were very good as in many of them were the same, whip was a nice touch.Further more if you watch it with a mind set that you want to see a lot of Predator and alien ... then this movie will satisfy your needs ... coz lets me honest this movie is basically all about them ...",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
662,flyingdj,Expect To Be Disappointed,1,28 December 2007,"When you go to see a movie like Aliens vs. Predator, you don't expect Oscar worthy dialog, top notch actors or complex story lines. You expect to see the meanest killing machine in this universe to fight the creepiest creatures one can imagine, with some humans caught in the middle. There's blood, pus and gore and a big showdown at the end.That's what you might get.But you might also get Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem. The story begins with a Predator ship bearing the spawn of an Alien infesting a Predator crashing somewhere in Colorado, followed by the immediate killing of the first two humans we've been introduced to. Meet the rest of the cast - Big Brother, who has been in and out of jail and has not done anything worth remembering in his life so far. Little Brother, who is a pizza delivery boy and a pussy in general. He gets beaten up by Three Random High School Boys who see him as a threat regarding his possible relationship with Blonde Dumb Teenage Bitch. Then there's Mexican Looking Sheriff, whose only hard task so far has probably been to catch a cow that had escaped from some farm. Meet Army Mother, who returns from combat only to bring home night vision goggles as a present - for her seven year old daughter. The rest of the cast consists of some dudes who are high on weed, a chef, some frightened wives and girlfriends, a pregnant woman, some nurses and doctors and a lot of army personal.Where was I? Ah yes, the story. So the ship crashed and aliens have landed on Earth. The Predator ship sends out one last call for help which is immediately picked up on the Predator home planet. What is obviously something like the Predator King decides that dozens of aliens and the mutated alien spawned from a Predator are just about enough to keep one of them busy, so he goes on his mission - alone.Meanwhile the humans are realizing that something is going on. Two of the city's inhabitants have died (and three homeless people living in the sewers, but those don't really matter). When the Predator arrives, he destroys the crashed ship, covers his tracks by pouring blue liquid over bodies and then shits on all that secrecy by skinning a cop alive and hanging him from a tree. So much for that.The film continues like that. We see characters being introduced to be killed seconds later, the Little Brother is about to bang Teenage Bitch in the school's swimming pool when Three Random High School Boys arrive to beat him up again, but then the aliens come and interrupt that little party. Of course the black guy dies first. They make it out alive, they meet up and really, I can't tell you the rest of the story without falling asleep.Let me rather concentrate on the highlights this movie has to offer even despite its heavy flaws. The Lonely Widow saying ""The government wouldn't lie to us!"" is, be it intentional or unintentional, the funniest line of the movie. The two Dudes On Weed getting their heads blasted away by the Predator comes in a close second, the little girl saying ""There's a monster outside my window"" with the parents reacting like parents would react to something like that makes it a third place. The Teenage Bitch being nailed to the wall is also a very satisfying experience.Apart from that, the movie is really that bad. The fighting scenes do not build up suspense, they're awfully cut and the fear that came with the Alien movies is literally non-existent because they are always behind you. Literally no one escapes in the last second, they all either die or make it out alive quite comfortably. None of the characters has depth, humor or any other trace of humanity that would make him distinguishable from the aliens. You won't care who makes it out alive because they're all the same, I have almost forgotten who survived.The ending is sad. Why? Because the ending is a spoiler that tells us there will be a third part. Please, please, leave the Predator alone and let the Aliens rest. I cannot bear another butchering of those classics. Avoid this movie. Really, even if story, dialog, yes acting itself doesn't matter to you, avoid it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
663,iguana_man3,This movie was sooo bad-ass!!,10,26 December 2007,"This Film is ALIEN VS PREDATOR Not fricken Dawsons creek meets aliens!The human drama is shallow, yes. This film is not meant to be human drama it is meant to be a film for the FANS!let me state that I read every review on this site for Avp-R and I can honestly say that the reviews on here are misleading.This movie is not meant to be a Ground breaking story, it's simply a fight film. It is true that the character plot is very thin and the people in the film are nothing more than prey for the 2 creatures to slaughter. Why ask for more though? No one is going into the theatre to see the new (human) characters and their story, we are going to see the predator kick some ass. So quit whining about the shallow character plot.BUT, this movie DOES deliver on the awesome battles between the aliens and the ""lone wolf"" predator. The special effects were bad ass, the sound was great. I don't get what everyone is bitching about. There is blood, guts, and gore. The people that wrote the reviews here obviously did not do their research on this film and the synopsis. The directors did what Paul Anderson could not and that was deliver a good battle between these two characters we all love. The first AvP did have A LOT more story to it but it lacked the visuals and the badass fight scenes this movie delivered to us fans.It is only 1 predator that does all the fighting in this film that would be correct. It is unnecessary for more predators to be on Earth, this sole predator is an Elite hunter, to clean up the aftermath left behind from the Crashed predator ship. This predator is the ""lone wolf"" and he goes alone to Earth vary capable of cleaning up all the aliens that are now on the loose.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
664,matt_laxton,Not bad at all,9,11 January 2008,"Aliens is one of my favorite movies, as is Predator I. This movie gets back to some of those basics. Predator 2, Alien Resurrection, and AVP were abominations which almost killed these movies. This one is surprisingly good. The action scenes were well done, the suspense was there. This was not a moronic gore flick, but a decent Aliens/predator movie. It does not live up to the originals of these series, but it comes a lot closer than AVP or Ressurrection. Maybe this movie will get them back on track.This movie does borrow heavily from the first 2 aliens, and first predator. This is alright by me, because it makes the movie feel more like them. Now what we need is a new, original script to get aliens back on track, and then an original predator script. Lets hope it happens! If you are a fan of the original 3 Aliens, and the original predator, you will like this movie. If you liked resurrection or AVP, you will probably not like this movie.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

I don't normally refer to casting, but if you consider there were very few well known actors in this film(at least not well known to me), they really pulled this off. In fact, after a short time you are drawn into the film and the story takes over. If you like the conflict between the Predator's and aliens then this is something you should see. The effects are seamless, but more importantly the sub plots are well written and brought into the final story/conflict. There are some pretty scary parts as well and are as creepy as the original.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Well, being a fanboy of the original films and seeing the trailer for this flick thinking, ""Is this for real? Am I actually seeing an Alien Vs. Predator film that takes it to the streets. The answer is yes. But these would be the streets of the most run down ghetto slum that exists. The film has some decent acting from the cop and the army chick but beside that wow... the younger brother was trying to be a stud but failed miserably. The ""hot chick"" says about 2 lines that aren't very convincing and trust me... she gets what she deserves. The bully is just a dumb brute. And the older brother, don't get me started on that guy. He was like a fonz-meets Easy Rider type guy and he was just junk. My favorite character would have to be the pizza hut guy who says ""screw saving the women and children this isn't titanic"" That is absolutely hilarious. The fight scenes are good between the monsters but the build up is way too long. The movie in a nutshell is basically... oh someone dies, lets check it out... oh someone dies, lets check it out. It's monotonous to say the least. During the final chaos scenes in the city the film does get better and some of the scenery is fantastic. Because I am easily amused, I'll give a 6 out of 10. Well, I take that back. That Titanic line was pretty funny. I'll give it a 7 out of 10. But to an average viewer, I suggest putting some thought into your moral standards before seeing this flick.

670,natanji,"Completely brainless, would be better without Aliens or Predators",1,6 January 2008,"After liking the first AvP movie a bit, I was really shocked after I had seen this one. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen.The greatest mistake: this movie attempts to be everything at once. It has a small teenage-horror part, it has a small romance, it has lots and lots of characters that are completely one-dimensional. You never get to like any of these characters - no time for that, because the idiots who made this movie just thought that it would be a nicer atmosphere if they first introduce 20 different faces just to kill them one after another. Less would have been more.Like this, the movie mainly is made out of killing scenes. Between that you see the survivors doing senseless actions. It's always the same: Alien arrives, whoever will get killed screams, you might see some gore. Then you see that the survivors find everything a bit more strange and freak out a little more. Then you see another Alien killing someone. Then it's the survivors again. Repeat this 50 times and you have this movie.They could have completely left out the Predator. It does not really change a thing about the outcome of the movie because everything gets blown up anyway, and the last scene in which you see Yutani is completely superficial and doesn't connect the least bit to the rest of the franchise's universe. The Pred is shown as another brainless creature just like the Aliens and what it does is senseless beyond belief.And you could just have made the Aliens to Zombies, too. That might have made it a bit nicer still, maybe Dawn of the Dead-like. You don't need to know that whatever kills everyone is an Alien, it could as well be zombies. It would make the atmosphere a lot more scary at least, in fact even create something like an atmosphere.Needless to say, the movie is full of plot-holes and completely incoherent. You see lots and lots of Aliens although there's just a few facehuggers to begin with, you see a Predalien that lays eggs which completely disregards what the Predalien is in the AvP game series.If you're some kind of brainless gore fetishist, you might still like this movie. In any other case, keep away from this one. I feel really ashamed for having spent money on this. A movie that for obvious reasons neither needs Aliens nor Predators to work exactly like that is a shame to the name of both races. Pure blasphemy.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

672,RogerDAWN,Could not get worse!!,2,26 December 2007,"The first AVP was enjoyable fun. This is pure and utter trash. The running time is 86 minutes but it felt like 286 minutes. The film just dragged on and on. There are pointless characters that you couldn't care less about. A pizza delivery guy who is in love with a jocks girl. Wow then his brother shows up who spent time in a back of a cop car? Who knows who cares?? Seriously it is just a jumbled mess.Finally the Predator comes to kick some ass and bring some life into this terminally ill film. WRONG!! He walks around with a blue liquid pouring it on all the remains of Aliens and humans to try to cover up whats happening?!?!? Even though there are hundreds of Aliens running around tearing apart the town? Makes no sense. Just total crap.Now Finally what everyone went to this movie in the first place, the battle between the Aliens and Predator!! Horrible, Vile, no not bad enough what word am I looking for Atrocious. Thats it. The fight scenes seemed to be filmed by two 6 year old battling for the camera to get the shot in a pitch dark room. You can barely make out whats going on. So the one reason for seeing this dog dung is ruined. There is one scene were one of the surviving groups members get killed climbing a alien wall and you couldn't even tell which one it was but it wouldn't of made any difference because you don't feel for anyone in this film. If they were all wiped out no one would of shed a tear.This has to be the worst movie of 2007 by far. I think I'm inspired to make movies after watching this. The strausse brother or whatever they are got to oversee this tripe then anyone can make a film. Seriously!! The only regrets I have is that this film single handedly destroyed both franchises.

673,redisss,for those who love ALIENs & Predators as species - THE MUST SEE!!,6,28 December 2007,"I was a bit cautious when i headed to the premiere together with my fellas, because one of them read an early review and warned us no to wait anything spectacular from this movie. And he was right... but just about ""movie"" part of this piece (this is why it has earned 9/10 not 10/10 human relations - a bit out of place). and now to the main idea - THIS IS THE HEAVEN (or HELL, you choose on your preferences)for any real ALIEN/PREDATOR fan out there. Why is that? Simply - here was EVERYTHING that an any real lover of Xenomorphs/Hunters would look to or have a nice nightmare about - pred-alien, LOTS of default aliens; powerful predator, stupid humans for food/skinning/cocoons, Weyland-Yutani,present day earth as a slaughter field and BIG BOOM! basically these are the things a fan needs + lots of explicit violence. And about violence - this is NOT a movie for kids and those with soft-hearted man. There are some VERY unpleasant scenes (Pred-alien + a mother which will give a birth any second = guess what happens?). But those cruel actions depict alien true nature better than in any other movie containing ALIENS - they are ruthless creatures which live only by their instincts - killing/breeding/food an that's it.This is not a blockbuster for everyone - it's just for those who love those creeps since 1979/87 and wants to see them fighting and killing each other in rather appropriate fashion.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
674,glx1969,"Totally mindless, senseless...",3,28 December 2007,"I'm not even sure why I'm giving 3 rather than 2 or 1. The special effects? Perhaps, not sure. Because the point of view is sometimes way too close to the action so you end up seeing nothing of what you are suppose to see.I've seen all the previous episodes, many times. (Have the DVD of Alien series: Alien, Aliens, Alien³, Alien:Resurrection) After (Jean-Pierre Jeunet) Resurrection, I thought that things could not go deeper in the wrong direction. Well, they did. Not just once. But twice.Many other comments are pointing out that this flick is more a teeny movie than a movie that shows any respect to the Alien (or Predator) fan. And they are quite right! Other then the special effects, you could think that the plot (a plot? which plot?) was written by drunk high school teenagers... I think Wes Craven himself would have done a better job.From the very beginning of the movie till the end, all the human characters are not showing the kind of reactions you would expect them to show, considering what they are going through. Because of that, you cant take the action seriously. You cant relate to anyone in this movie. In Aliens, there was Corporal Hicks, cool guy always wanting to make the best decision. In AVP:R, there is no such character. No one makes sense at all. Everyone seems to be disconnected from what is happening around. So how can you feel something for them when they don't feel anything themselves? The actors are all extremely ordinary. You could have done a similar job yourself, probably. I cant think of another movie that is as bad as this one.Next time movie makers want to make a clone to I still know what you did last summer, they should hire Wes Craven.

The movie did not hold up to the previous AVP movie, as a matter of fact the games are much better than this movie. I expected more from this movie, but it seems Hollywood was more interested in putting something out there for the Christmas season instead of giving the movie a real story line. Unlike AVP, the people in the movie did not have personalities. The woman who just came home from the Army never spoke about what she did there, or what her specific skills were... so how did the ""Dallas"" character suddenly assume she knew how to fly a helicopter? Since when will ""we"" EVER nuke one of our own cities? The story did not have a real conclusion so we can wait till the next one is released. Who knows, it may be even better.

679,oihadsf,The current 18 pages of comments sold me on this film,9,29 December 2007,"9 out of 10 you better believe it... but why? Like I said, the comments sold me on this film. Every bad comment discussed character development, plot lines, plot holes, etc etc. Every great comment discussed kick assery, sweet gadgets, and lots and lots of mindless violence and destruction. That's how I knew I would love this movie. Now before the nut jobs reading this judge me, I'm not a fan of real life violence. I understand the difference between fantasy and reality. Which is why I can love this movie so damn much. Here it goes...Look at the title people. I think the first three words might be Alien vs. Predator. I don't see anything in that title that would lead me to believe ""Oscar worthy"" or ""in-depth"". So I wonder, when you hear that what does your brain think? If your brain thinks character development, then you have serious problems with the way your brain processes information. If you hear sweet alien death scenes then your brain is working top notch. Just think about it, when you hear WWF Cage Match are you really hoping to see 40 minutes of The Undertaker discussing why he's in the cage match and how if he doesn't win, he won't have the money for his daughter's surgery. Hell no, all you hear is kicking ass. (On a side note I don't watch wrestling, it's just a good metaphor)This movie was everything I wanted it to be. I didn't want to see a movie that sucked me into the characters and made me care about them. I didn't want a movie that spent more than five minutes progressing a plot. I wanted exactly what that title states. I wanted something based solely on straight up sci-fi killing madness. The damn movie is called Alien vs. Predator. That's all I wanted to see and that's exactly what I got. Aliens fighting a predator, a predator fighting aliens. It's in the damn title people.If you went to see this movie and didn't enjoy it... tough luck. Think for a change. So to actually give some advice for the movie going public that is still reading this far, (congrats, you have patience above and beyond the majority of people, which is kinda sad, but $#%& them, they couldn't read this far anyways) if you want an in depth movie that will make you think and care and feel emotions, DO NOT see this movie. You will hate it. Go see Juno or Charlie Wilson's War instead. However, if you want exactly what the title states, you will get it, and you will love every single moment of it. This movie is as bad ass as it is kick ass. Trust me on this one, if watching Alien's fight a Predator ends up in your fantasies as often as hot chick's do (which I honestly hope it doesn't, though I can understand how that could be) you will love everything you see.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
680,tcalbaz,Fine scary alien horror movie stands on its own merit.,9,30 December 2007,"REVIEW ALIENS VS PREDATOR REQUIEM (AVP 2)First lets get this straight. I've seen all of the Alien films at least 4 or 5 times except for the first Aliens VS Predator (AVP). The bottom line: Try to see this movie with fresh eyes. I believe there is adequate but not perfect to the previous AVP movie. Come to this movie as if you had never seen any of the previous alien movies before and be prepared to be entertained and thrilled. Aliens VS Predator Requiem is a classic scary alien horror movie that pays homage to the genre in great classic style. Director brothers Colin Strause and Greg Strause have done a fine job delivering a first class product. The movie never losses its pace or focus. There are no wasted scenes. Judged on its own merit this is a great, entertaining flick.Now for those people who've seen all of the other Alien movies: In this movie the creatures themselves are terrifying, grim, merciless and nasty. What makes it all the more poignant is that the audience is given some time to first bond with the main characters of the story. Whenever they get hurt we feel it. The fact that the actors are not big-name actors does not seem to hinder the movie at all. Their reactions, emotions and behavior are believable. They do a great acting job.The small town sheriff played by Steven Pasquale played well the role of a man facing his vulnerabilities. He came across as someone who was trying to maintain a brave front with things that were beyond his understanding. One tends to feel sorry for him.There is the woman hero (a la Ripley) played by Reiko Aylesworth. She plays a returning national guard person returning home to her family.The two brothers Dallas and Tim played by Steven Pasquale and Sam Trammell are quite believable as men dealing with their own life issues rudely interrupted by horror.CGI F/X as to be expected were flawless. The Sound track kept your heart racing. Some of the viewing audience might come away from this movie maybe a little bit disappointed that it didn't follow one of the old familiar formulas of the previous Alien movies. I say: wonderful - thats a good thing. This movie was utterly enjoyable. I'd see it again.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

It made Predator seem nice people but they are hunters and don't reward anyone with anything cause they're trained to kill! It was so pathetic and embarrassing to watch because of this! But this one it made you quite tense at times (NOT ALL TIMES) the tension kind of lacked a bit I'm afraid but some of the scenes were fantastic.Also someone said it was rubbish because it was all dark and you couldn't see anything. But how much can you see when the entire town is plunged into darkness? You ain't going to see much now are you. It was done very tastefully actually. But some parts were annoying cause you couldn't see what was going on.But it was fantastic and I'm glad I bought it now, it made the predator's and Alien's more scary and the Director actually made the aliens more believable than the first one which was mostly stupid CGI.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

It was exactly like the sound track from Aliens when the Marines meet the Aliens under the Cooling Towers, almost too alike! Also a lot of background and pacing sound seemed to be copied from Predator ""jungle"" scenes.To me it seemed like the film was made by two fans. Although they may have had the best intentions and a shed load of money, they forgot some of the basics of film making.Not one to see in the cinema or hire on DVD.

684,stubbs1989,Would have been better if i could see anything,4,8 April 2009,"So this movie wasn't great. Not that i expected it to be by any fathom of the imagination. But what frustrated me more than anything else was the fact that it was so dark through most of the movie that you couldn't really understand what was happening. Now i understand that filming in such a manner is a stylistic choice, and i can respect that. But there is a limit. I watched the majority of this film straining to make out the characters and the action, so much so that i was too distracted to actually try and follow the plot. The film had potential. The first Alien vs. Predator was pretty good, and for the most part delivered everything it promised in my opinion. It also developed some interesting back story. But it's too bad this sequel couldn't build upon that.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

686,joshuabeattie1,"Violent, but old-fashioned.",10,26 December 2007,"The feel I got from the film walking out from it was that it was old-fashioned. The music, special effects, actors, camera, and even text for the ending credits was all old-fashioned.The movie was still good, with a decent amount of violence. I just wish they took full advantage of the action sequences and story line. There could have been a lot more kills by the predator(s). The camera work in the action sequences made it very hard to see what was going on. Half the time I couldn't tell the difference between the pred-alien and the predator because the camera was moving so fast and close-up. They should have done some slow motion. The action in this movie is very fast. It was nice to get a sense of the speed, but it would have been nice to get a sense for the detail of what was happening too. Therefore, I think they should have put a slow motion action sequence or two at the start and get real close up action '300' style. This would have laid the foundation for the faster sequences which are more of the same. If they wanted no slow-motion, they should have shown more kills and better camera work.I liked the violence, but as I said, it could have been clearer and more of it. Myself and I guess everyone else just want gore, gore, gore. Also, they should have made the aliens and predators fully CG and get rid of all the costumes and robots. Mixing CG with costumes ruined the details for me.I liked some of the characters in the movie, but really, their introduction was really not necessary. It seemed like a waste of time when that time could have been filled with more gore. Gore gore gore. Thats all I really wanted from this movie, and it delivered, although not quite perfectly.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
687,jiminyjillickers2000,Not gangsta at all....not at all.,1,30 December 2007,"The acting, writing, directing, and lack of breasts made this movie despicable, as it would for any movie, especially a horror/action film. The characters were as dull as stones; it was impossible to be impacted by any of their deaths. For example, in the beginning of the movie, a child and his father were introduced to the audience merely to be slaughtered five minutes later! Their deaths could not possibly mean anything to any audience. If the characters were developed more then killed off, I wouldn't have felt so drowsy. The death of every character was equally boring in comparison with the first few. Another aspect of the combined script and acting--The government official had a really lame one-liner and did not put nearly enough passion into it: ""What the f*** are you?"" Well, like Nostradamus would have and should have, I predicted that there would be a government official involved in the movie with a lame one-liner. However, I was hoping that official would say, ""DAMMIT"" and actually MEAN it. He said the actual one-liner too casually without the rage necessary to make me want to get out of my seat and rip my shirt off. I was flabbergasted, son! (So I ended up ripping it off, anyway). In addition to that, I was angry about the blonde who never ended up taking her bra off! All right, if they screw up on the government official, that's bad enough, but no boobs EITHER?! MADNESS! One fourth into the movie that was the only highlight my friend and I were looking forward to, and it didn't even happen! I knew I should have asked Nostradamus before viewing...Oh yeah, she ended up dying anyway. I didn't care anymore, because I all ready knew she wasn't going to take it off. Like everyone else who has viewed the movie, I agree that the lighting was way too dark. It was impossible to distinguish alien from predator at some moments, but overall, the action was indistinguishable. Enough of that. How the characters also just accepted their deaths without fighting back was sort of annoying. They would stand, stare, scream, and die. Whatever. I didn't feel the fear. They accepted their demises as if they were predestined; in reality, the directing was just careless. However, if the movie was just a bit longer, it would have been the best sleeping experience I would have ever known. (Nostradamus said so.)",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
688,Julie01961,Too many humans,4,25 December 2007,"The movie begins with a flashback of the end of AVP1. After that there is a little bit of alien moments mixed in with a ton of human/relationship moments that are simply not necessary. In the past the Alien and Predator movies including AVP1 have a limited number of human interaction which makes you appreciate what little humans there are and how heroic they become in the face of the bloody onslaught. But this is an entire town and I expect the audience is supposed to develop deep emotions for the humans, be they good or bad. However in just an hour and a half, you can't immerse yourself in that. My daughter gave this a verbal 1 and my husband a 5. I at least wanted it to have a lower rating than the initial AVP because that was OUTSTANDING based on my above criteria. There is a chance I may not even purchase this movie when it comes out on DVD and that's a bloody shame. Maybe next time....",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

It amazes me that anyone can take two of film's most daunting creatures (Alien and Predator), put the two together and make a bad film - the ingredients are too good to mess up.But this happened with the first AvP film, which was very poor, and this one is also rubbish. While technically it may be miles ahead of the original Alien and Predator films in terms of visual effects (and budget), the total lack of any suspense, plot or any other features that make films worth watching means that it's one of the few films I've not wanted to get to the end of. Another reviewer said that these things don't matter, this was just a violence-fest. I don't agree. They matter a lot, and being totally absent means this is one of the most cringeworthy pieces of junk ever committed to celluloid, given the high level of expectation one could demand with such characters.AvP:R is rubbish. Everyone to do with it (and I mean EVERYONE) should own up, and give up. Give someone with some talent and ability the chance to make a movie. AvP was something I was waiting for for years, and when the first movie arrived, I was disappointed, but hoped a next film would be better. It isn't.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Maybe the creativity just doesn't exist, it sure looks like it.I hate it when unintelligent people take (is allowed to take) a really REALLY good concept and turn it into crap. I for one thought it was a real shame for the genre & flat out embarrassing too watch.

Why did it take just one afternoon for the predator to travel to earth. 2. Why did they send just one predator? 3. Why did a hick-town cop manage to sneak up on this ""elite predator"" in the woods""? 4. Why did the predator leave the cop in the trees, isn't he pretty concerned about not leaving any traces? 5. Why did the aliens burst out of the rib cage as soon as the man & his boy woke up? 6. Why didn't the sheriff call any help from the outside when they discovered the skinned cop. 7.

There is also a new ingredient thrown into the mix which makes it a lot more interesting than the first installment.

694,ogdoz,A horror classic,10,11 December 2020,"What makes AVPR great is it's synchronization of sound, visuals and showing great attention to detail. Not only that but AVPR has an unnerving atmosphere right from the beginning. We're introduced to a crew who is not exactly too friendly to each other add to that the ship. It's huge, and with its halls and corridors, it feels almost like a maze.Enter Alien, a ruthless parasite with humanoid form yet it lacks any civilised traits of a human. It does have humanoid form but it doesn't give a single emotion. The design of the monster is what's the most terrifying (and it still holds up despite AVPR being released in 2007). The creature is also better adapted to the ship's interior making a big part of the movie feel like a sinister game of cat and mouse.What I particularly like is how the characters are written. They are not Hollywoodized heroes, in fact, there is no hero. They're just people which makes them even more threatened. The performances are all equally realistic and do deliver. Kudos to directors Brothers Strause for using crafty cinematography and combining it with shadows and lights in an eerie way. The music is unrelenting and combined with Strause's cinematography, sound and visuals it adds to the eeriness.The plot is also not another Hollywoodized cliché. It's more like ""survival of the fittest"". The characters battle true terror as they race to survive or outlive each other, they're all just a part of a race to see who will prevail and who will die.Final Rating: 10/10",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

703,bhzvyjd,Underrated,10,13 May 2021,"This film really gets a lot of flack that it doesn't actually deserve. Okay, maybe I have a slightly different view of films than the general population, though I have discovered that my feelings of a film generally sit well with the ratings that appear on IMDB, in most cases that is. Okay, I can sort of understand how people have reacted to some of the gore that appears in this film, and also the rather lame attempt at creating a Predalien, though I don't necessarily think that it was as bad as some people believe (though its ability to generate eggs as if it were a queen was something that sort of came out of the blue).Look, sure, there are a few scenes in this film that do break the cardinal rules of story telling, such as never killing kids, or suddenly killing off a character with no tension or lead up whatsoever, but that didn't actually undermine my enjoyment of the film. Sure, one could argue that there is either the shock factor, or pushing the boundaries, though I still find the onscreen killing of kids to be going just that little bit too far. As for the sudden death due to friendly fire, well, that goes beyond lazy story telling. Sure, in movies like this, we expect that pretty much a majority of the characters are going to die, but the thing is there are ways to kill of a character in a cinematic way, and the more important the character is, the more cinematic the death should be. Unfortunately, at one point in this film they did drop the ball somewhat.So, the film is pretty much set straight after the first in this series, and we have a predator that has been infested with an alien. Well, the alien escapes, causes damage to the ship, escapes in an escape pod and returns to Earth where it crashes in the Colorado wilderness. Also, the pod contains a number of face huggers, so you can be assured that this scenario is going to be set up with lots and lots of Aliens running around this small American town. Actually, this is a scenario that had yet to be explored, so I guess this is one of the reasons that I actually quite liked the film. However, before one of the predators was killed, it managed to send off a distress signal, so another predator travels to Earth to basically clean up the mess - thus we have what one could consider a true Alien vs Predator film.Yeah, now that I think about it, that previous film really did let me down a bit, namely because of the whole idea that the predators created the Aliens to hunt, and us humans were really only fodder to fuel their hunting desires. While the pyramid under the ice was pretty cool, simply turning us into just another game reserve for a bunch of hunters really didn't do it for me to the same extent.However, this film was much better in that regards, particularly with not only having an Alien infestation reach Earth, but also having a Predator, and a particularly will trained one at that, coming in to attempt to clean it all up. Where as the first movie pretty much had a bulk of the predators being taken out by the aliens fairly quickly, it was much better watching a seasoned hunter deal with them with no problem whatsoever. I guess that is another reason why they had to create the Predalien, even if it is only to give this particular guy a challenge. Still, with the speed at which the Alien's propogate he certainly wasn't in the position to clean the area up completely, which is why they had to end it the way they did.Still, it is pretty clear that the only way to bring this film to a close was they way that they brought it to a close. Maybe it seemed to be one of those situations that pretty much everything was lost so they pretty much pressed the reset button. However, considering that there were a lot of scenes which were reminiscent of the earlier films, when we consider Aliens, then the ending here was rather appropriate.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

The story was low grade but at least it was written well without too many clichés or corny lines.One thing that holds this sequel, AVP Requiem is writing. Clichés galore, and lines such as ""We're not ready for this technology yet..."" or ""We need guns,"" hit into your lower gut but then again you cannot help but giggle. Action is spectacular, and sometimes over the top, the way we like it in sci fi/horror genre, but writing ruins everything. The script could have used some further revising before it got put into pre production. At times, it felt as if the script was looking for which way to go.Furthermore, there are some characters whose sole purpose was to be there and get killed. At one point I thought there were too many characters in the movie.After viewing hundreds and hundreds of horror movies, there are certain things we just don't want the characters to say. Lines ""We end to get out of here,"" and ""We must go now,"" are said way too often. Dialogue and the story takes audience to be an illiterate herd who came just to get entertained.And yes, I was entertained. I enjoyed the action and direction. But that's all. in the end I can say it was fun, but in the end that's all I can say. To say it was good, I would be lying. To say it was horrible, that's kind of blowing it out of proportion.

That is when this movie becomes awesome. I loved seeing the humans get splattered. There was a point in the movie where I just cheered (alongside the rest of the theater) at the sheer amount of death that was being shoved onto screen. I was rooting for the Aliens and the Predator the entire movie.Wolf was the most bad ass Yautja I have ever seen...The way he offs those Aliens made me giggle like a school girl on speed. Because of the awesome effects...I would watch it again. The Predalien was totally sick looking and it made me happy to see how they brought him to life. I can't wait for this movie to come on DVD.

Alien Vs Predator. So what was the second film about? The plot was loose, the characters barely one-dimensional and we have a Predator running around trying to kill the aliens and cover his tracks. Why? Are they worried mankind is going to find out there is something more out in space and suddenly build spaceships with technology they don't have? Silly. So many unanswered questions, subplots that led nowhere, guy coming out of prison; mother returning home from tour of duty; school belle going out with semi-geek kid. None of it was capitalised on. And how did the Colonel (or whatever his rank was)in such a short space of time, with very limited intelligence (none) organise a nuclear strike on a small American town? Can't think of an ending - I know, I'll drop a bomb on everything. What weak, ineffectual writing. I only hope the screenwriter gets busted down to scripts for Barney the big purple dinosaur.

No computer generated characters and fight scenes, all characters were people dressed in Halloween costumes. Reminded me of a 1970s Japan remake of Godzilla vs Mothra. Just terrible, maybe they can revitalize this series with a part 3, as it won't take much more creativity to make this more watchable.

716,darthmetalhead1,AVP-Requiem delivers a great Christmas Present!,10,25 December 2007,"I'm not sure if if I'm going to be including a spoiler or not but I wanted to add my 2 cents worth as best as I can. I too am a huge fan of both the Aliens and Predator movies and this will definitely be added to my collection when it comes out on DVD! I'm probably being a little biased by giving it a 10 but it blew AVP 1 right out of the water. And Yes I too am a huge fan of the first AVP film. OK sure there are moments in the film that seemed unrealistic. However, personally I was still scared out of my wits while watching it.Now after getting home and going to work from watching AVP2-Requiem I'm still trying to let everything settle in. I was very satisfied with all the acting, scoring, visual effects and yes even the script was very gripping. Sure there were a few scenes that were difficult to see but the fact that AVP1 made enough money to spawn a sequel even on the limited budget. I'm not sure how much money Avp2 is going to make but the first 3 showings at my local theater were sold out.The music was very nice paying homage to the Alien and Predator movies using themes and blends of atmosphere from them. I couldn't believe that the movie was actually only short of an hour and a half (1:26) it seemed a lot longer. The fact that the movie was on limited budget I believe the Brothers Strause delivered a great Christmas present for me. I was not let down from the red ban trailer seeing the gore, action and acting. I knew what I was getting into when I went to the theater after seeing the trailer and I'm looking forward to seeing it again before it leaves. I also believe it continued from the first movie very well.Again overall a 10 and without giving too much away it's better than the first one.

717,Dylan_V,Pretty good,7,29 January 2008,"May be some spoilers so do not read if you haven't seen it yet.Personally, I thought this was a good movie when I first saw it. Much better than what Paul Anderson put out. I'd like to point out what I liked about the film.The predator, this was probably the best part about the movie. He was put back to where he should be, the same league as the first and second predator. Lots of new equipment to look at and lots of life he was about to take away from those aliens. Also for me, he was probably the most interesting character.The directing/directors, this is highly debated by a number of people. But they forget that the lighting and writing is not their fault. It was their visual concept and I think they did pretty well for first time directors.The predalien, another highly debated subject. Some just call it an atrocious predator that produces aliens. But personally, besides for the dreadlocks, I thought it was awesome. Looked cool, did it's job as a young queen, and entertained me whenever it showed up on film.The characters, somewhat believable characters in a small town. The acting for each characters was adequate.But now I have to discuss what I didn't like about the film.The aliens, I mean come on. They barely hurt the predator in this film except for the power plant and the predalien. Believe me when I say this, I am a much bigger Predator fan than Alien fan. But aliens can't be this badly downgraded. I can believe ""Aliens"". Highly trained marines, future guns, etc. but the one predator killed about 20 aliens without breaking a sweat. I wanted the predator to be good, but not godly. Hopefully the next film, they have 5-6 predators and 20 aliens for a ""ritual"". Just not like the first AVP.The lightning, pretty self explanatory, it was too dark. I can't blame this on the directors, but it was a bit annoying not seeing some of the action.The film's time. I mean only 80 minutes? Come on, give the story some more time to mature and make the characters more interesting.The script, simply put, GET RID OF SHANE SALERNO.In conclusion, I enjoyed this movie a lot.

Aliens or Alien 2 is still my favorite movie to this day. I am not the type of person who likes just any movie because I am a fan of a series or character. A v P 2 really caught my interest because it reminded me of the Aliens graphic novel where earth is overrun by Aliens and there are only a handful of humans left. After seeing the film I was happily surprised on how well it was made. The movie pulls no punches and is as violent as ever. The Aliens were great and so was the Predator. This is the beginning of the end for earth and hopefully they continue to go into this direction. I also liked the fact that they used basically new, no name actors. Not to say that these actors are no names...I just cant find a better phrase for it. It had th feel of the old Aliens movie with the screams and automatic gunfire, and the ending...boy....if you are a fan, this will be even better for you. Overall I thought A v P Requiem was good and it gets a recommendation from this Aliens fan...! Go see it!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
719,kotekmoi,a movie that will not disappoint you if you are a fan,7,28 December 2007,I've gotta say that it is way better than part 1 because part 1 was just pathetic. This movie kills it. the good thing is that it has lots of gore in it. the Predator in this movie is really cool as well but they could of spaced him out a bit more. Plus they could of used more then one Predator in this movie. In this movie there's only one Predator that arrives on earth that was a bit of a letdown at least in part one there is more than one Predator. To some people it will make them scared but some people will not be scared like me and my cousin. Some of the fights are a bit corny and also don't go on long enough. They only go on for about a minute but it's also worth the time. sometimes the camera is so close up to the fight you don't know what's going on. It has its ups and downs but overall it's a very decent movie to watch.,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
720,akibukis,Complete disaster,1,17 February 2008,"I've seen many good and bad action/horror movies, but this one is the worst one. Of all times. Seriously. I'm not going to mention all of the plot flaws - here are plenty of comments where it's already done. I just want to recommend for someone to make a remake of this garbage. A comedy/parody one. Here's one example: ""Scene in a hospital. The pregnant woman's water is broke. A nurse is going after a doctor for a help and then she gets caught on her neck by an Alien. There was a pause and Alien should say here (preferably in Dr. Zoidberg's voice (Futurama)): I'M THE DOCTOR!!""This movie just couldn't keep the necessary mood. The beginning of it was promising, but it got ruined a few moments later. It made me actually laugh at the few scenes, not scared or shocked. And to not mention the pathetic ending texts ... it's just horrible.And what's the best thing - there will be a next part of it. Don't waste your time.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
721,zeroend,Much better than the first AVP!,4,25 December 2007,"Like a lot of others, i felt the first AVP film was a disgrace to the aliens/predator series. This film makes up for it with improved action sequences, better pacing, and some truly satisfying special effects. The action between the predator and the aliens will keep you on the edge of your seat right up until the end. But be forewarned though....this movie is strictly for fans of the previous two franchises! If your a person thats looking to get your introduction into either series, start with the first two alien films or the original predator film. And any others that don't care about either, this movie will not persuade you to like it. It's completely unintelligent as far as stories, characters, or plot goes. Some of the acting will even make you laugh in parts, but it's nothing to horrible. Overall, if your a fan of either series, this is a must see! You will have a hell of a time at the theater watching it with your buddies. I just wish the directors and screenwriters of these films would consider putting as much time and intelligence into the story, and characters as Ridley Scott and James Cameron did.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

It is what it claims to be all out war between the aliens and the predator. who cares if we don't really get to know any of the human characters and we don't care if they live or die the film isn't really about them (the clue is in the title). yes it is dark but if you really can't see whats going on then you either need glasses or a better TV. this film was what i hoped it would be and what i wanted from the first one. people need to get over the fact that this is not Cameron's Aliens vs John McTiernan's Predator. it was never going to be that but for what it is, a film about a predator killing lots of aliens and a load of humans caught in the middle, it is fantastic.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

It would have been cool if those aliens had been the most lethargic and least ambitious, and if one or two of the Hobaliens had just hung around the center of town bumming spare change from the regular aliens, drinking cheap wine and offering to clean the windshields of the humans fleeing the city. Sure there is carnage but geez a little humour would have gone a long way. Where is Bill Paxton when you need him. Nice touch naming the main good guy and hero Dallas.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
724,jcorvin,We need to go back to a good plot...,3,21 February 2008,"Alright here is what we got...first off we start with the plane crash landing in a field and a son getting an egg planted in him. Now I don't have problem with that, but I do have a problem with the director's showing the alien come out of the kids chest. That was pretty much the basis of the whole movie...lets see how far we can push the envelope on what is too grotesque for people and whats inappropriate. I really didn't like the scene where pregnant women are attacked in the hospital ward by the hybrid pred/alien. That was a very disturbing scene and it still haunts me to this day. This film was mostly a bloodbath of constant killing and the Predator is far more a better hunter than the alien is. I can't imagine that with a ship going down with aliens and egg-layers on board they send only one Predator to take care of it. On top of that he was like a cover-up specialist or hired by the mob to clean the mess they make. What really got me with that was that he used the liquid on the kid/father, but forgot to do something with the skinned body hanging from the tree? Interesting concept, but overall we need to go back to the originals which were scarier and had a much better plot than the whole predator vs. alien series put together. Too much of trying to be into the gore and pushing boundaries on what people can handle.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
725,behjeh,Let's trash a couple of movies franchises to make some money!,3,23 April 2008,"The Alien franchise began with lofty ambitions when Ridley Scott introduced us to a uniquely thrilling cult classic sci-fi horror film called Alien, which was hailed by both fans and critics alike. Cramped confines and nothing beyond but the uncaring void of space invoked a unique sense of terror in unwitting humans battling an indefatigable and invincible foe (whose mortality became a lot more apparent in the later installments). The franchise rapidly devolved into the sci-fi action genre with James Cameron's second offering, which although excellent in its own right, spawned a series of less than impressive and repetitive successors. The Predator series, on the other hand, began with sci-fi action well in mind and offered a couple of intriguing and memorable films, although nothing on the level of the earlier Alien films.AVP is the culmination of the devolvement of these series into the world of kitschy sci-fi action. Plots are scrapped to make way for better special effects and more gruesome alien gore. AVP pits the two famed invincible alien races against each other, with innocent and unsuspecting humanity stuck smack dab in the middle, because honestly, why would we care without the plight of humans at stake? There's no longer the need for Sigourney Weaver's repeated incarnations because there's no need for top-shelf stars when the movie has no intention of providing any inkling of character development.AVP Requiem (questionably titled as it is) fails because it's unable to keep us engaged in the ensuing conflict. We don't care about the conflict taking place because we don't care about the characters involved in the struggle. The action that takes place is a slightly entertaining side effect of the battle, but not enough to induce any sort of emotive response from its viewers. The ever-present level-headed sheriff, the war-torn family, and the jealous bully boyfriend / Mr. Nice Guy / girl who goes for the jock but really just wants the nice guy love triangle are all insignificant side stories that attempt to keep us interested in the (lack of) characters, but the effort is unbearably futile, buried in mind-bogglingly bad acting and uninteresting character backgrounds. The filmmakers attempt to shock us with the unflinching brutality of the aliens with a series of grisly assaults on the unsuspecting humans (including a woman in the throes of childbirth), but the viewer is numbed by the fact that the humans could be replaced by cardboard cutouts and generate the same emotional response.The current intent of the franchise is as apparent as ever with the latest installment. The intent at film-making as an art form has been tossed in order to obtain a profit from the mainstream movie-goer market, of which it was at least reasonably successful. Unfortunately, the reputation of a couple of once-respectable movie franchises are victimized to achieve that result.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
726,taylorgrigsby,Get to the Choppa!,10,26 December 2007,"After the 2004 debacle that was the original AVP, consumers of good movies were left with a bad taste in their mouth and still hungry for the true showdown between Aliens and the Predator. Something to feed the inner geek ... and on Christmas day, 2007, thousands of those inner geeks finally got their meal.Alien vs. Predator Requiem was helmed by the Struase brothers, two young special effects wizards who grew up with both of the franchises as inspiration for their careers, where the original AVP was directed by a person with little knowledge of either series. The Struases finally bring our two favorite interstellar monsters together in a way to leave audiences thrilled and smiling. Their knowledge of action-oriented scenes brings this movie to ultimate levels of fan service. At times, particularly the ""human"" heavy scenes, the duo's directing prowess seems a bit strained, but who goes to this movie to see the humans anyway? (Living, loving, feeling ... sounds kinda boring) That said, science fiction aficionados will find a lot of one-liners to chuckle over.Though this film does pick up where the previous AVP left off, anyone vaguely familiar with these franchises shouldn't feel a need to watch that older hunk of dreck. This new iteration brings both Aliens and the Predator to life, and tells the story of this new conflict in a very visual and appealing manner. Throughout, our human protagonists frequently find their way into the crossfire between the creatures, mostly providing hosts for Alien reproduction. Or food.The films real strength lies in the conflict of the Predator and Alien protagonists, as these beings are both very intelligent and compelling, examples of these creatures at their prime. Here, we find the first specimen of a truly elite, well-trained Predator ever brought to the screen, and our Alien hero is a special treat. They are beings with their own agendas, leaving the viewer with the choice of who to root for - a true sign of dynamic film-making, if nothing else.Of course, the film wraps with the prompt for a sequel, a sad hallmark of our studio system today. Ironically, we wouldn't have this movie if not for this whole sequel concept, so I swallow this kiss-off with a grain of salt.But man, there is nothing like the pure glee I find whenever the Predator tears into a scene ... perhaps, the biggest and baddest of bad-asses space has to offer.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

I think it shouldn't be that bad.The most promising point was the indications of a third avp movie. I wish they wouldn't do such mistakes as much as this one. There are too many fans of these creatures; so it mustn't be a disappointment.So you'll ask me why I gave 7 stars for this movie; let me tell you why. I love to see those aliens and predators fight.

It seems very lazy that this storyline and these characters are the best that the writers could come up with. I get that trying to establish a new Ripley but it was so hollow an attempt that it never felt real. Everything felt dead and lifeless. With such great characters like the Alien and Predator, how could the movie miss so badly. They must have thought no one had ever seen the earlier Predator and Alien films so they could create new rules and a whole new mythology.

729,rijoenpial-1,'Requiem' for the Original franchises,1,5 January 2008,"WARNING - SPOILERS I had very low hopes when I went to see this movie the other day.I mean, a TV cast, inexperienced directors, Shane Salerno still onboard after that dreadful first draft he did reviewed by AICN...? Despite all that, I went in...Oh boy... And I thought I had some issues with AVP... AVPR is nothing but issues....continuity, plot, script, special effects, camera work and angles, editing, pace, lighting (made worse by the blackout plot device), terrible line delivery and acting... Nothing survived...AVP had problems, but it was mostly an enjoyable movie, with good VFX, cool production design, provided we didn't think too much about it... Now this sequel was so badly filmed and edited, made worse by the dull, wooden acting and the Predator's 'What the hell' incoherent MO and Aliens' 'mere cannon fodder-ish' portrayal...It has a less budget than AVP and given the story and setting, it required two or three times that...The movie falls more to the lower teen slasher movie genre, with gratuitous violence shown inflicted on pregnant women, newborn babies (though only implied) and a child, with a chestburster coming out of him... And even then, the fact that the scenes are so darkly lit, it doesn't show much of anything, neither the action sequences between Aliens and Predators, nor the gore, only seeing some dark substance which we assume is blood... So, even the gore is disguised by the low lighting, making everything very hard to see: every Alien-Predator or Predator-Predalien fight sequences, and I do mean EVERY...Not to mention considerate plot holes in all of them, namely the apparently un-acidic Alien blood and the poor, docile Xenomorphs' antagonistic display during their 'fights'(if we can call them that) with the too-detectivesque Predator... So, this is a step backwards regarding AVP in every way, from script to technical issues, and not a good prognosis for an Alien 5 or Predator 3 at all...The money this movie makes will be the judge of that...Although, given the fact that since ALien 3, the movies have been decreasing in terms of quality, I find it difficult to believe that someday, down the road, we will be having any more movies featuring these two creatures on their own...which is how they work best...Only time (together with a good script surfacing and an adequate budget with it) will tell...",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

For most action movies, you come in to the movie with a great idea of what to expect, but you get to enjoy the visuals and a bunch of people (and/or things) killing each other. Not here. The camera is panned so close to the action, all you can see is the Predator's breasts, and the action sequences were always over in about 3 seconds.

731,planemusic16,Are you kidding?,1,25 December 2007,"It's sad to see movies and franchises these days go down the drain. Let me tell you, I am a huge fan of both the Alien and Predator series. But, I've got to say, this is by far the worst out of all of them. AVP1 was bad. But, at least there was a point to watching it.So, the Predator ship (which is the size of your local Super Wal-mart) crash lands in Colorado...and nobody notices??? Hmmmm...Out of all the space technology we have and no one notices a Super Wal-Mart heading for CO, USA? Uhh...Nasa...apparently your funding has been stopped.Second of all, there isn't any sort of character development. You pretty much hate every single character and actor(because there is so much talent in the acting *sarcasm added*). And everyone that you want to survive....dies. I could care less about any one of the characters in the movie. If you are going to have an Alien/Predator movie, please make at least one hero. I mean for the love of all things reasonable, WHERE IS RIPLEY?! I maybe get the mother daughter ensemble resembling Ripley and Newt in the original ""Aliens"". But give me a break! They have very little if any story to them at all.It was at the point that an Alien kills a woman about to give birth that I decided this movie was not worth watching. I'm sorry, but I could live without seeing an Alien kill innocent babies and pregnant ladies in a maternity ward.So amidst all of the pointless killing and gore, I tried finding any redeeming value in watching this movie. Believe it or not I found something to appreciate. It makes me appreciate movie making in the 70's and 80's; how well WRITTEN the original Alien and Predator movies were. Stories of survival and characters for which you cheered on in their desperate fight for survival. Stories of learning to think one step ahead of your enemy. Movies where your law enforcement officers are clueless and idiotic; where the National guard is made to look like clowns dying at a circus just doesn't make for good viewing.Sigourney Weaver, Ridley Scott and Arnold Schwarzenegger, please come save the Aliens and Predators! They desperately need your help to survive!!!!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
732,trainmaster-3,"Thanks, Strause Brothers...",9,25 December 2007,"... for taking us back to the roots of what these horror movies are all about. Blood, guts, gore, and a liberal amount of cursing!I'll have to agree with other reviews I've read that the plot is kind of poor, but when you've got the Universe's most virulent biological weapon loose on Earth, being hunted by Rasta on super steroids, and puny humans caught in the middle, who needs a plot? BTW fellows, if your wife wants to have another child and you ain't thrilled with the prospect, take her to see this movie. Even as a long time fan of the Alien franchise, I found the nursery scene to be a bit unnerving!Touching on the weak points first, aside from the absence of plot, there were a couple of other things that I have to pick on. First off, since when did the gestation for the Aliens get so short? In the last two AvP movies, it looks like minutes instead of hours or even days like in the original Alien movies. Two, other than Alien fodder, why were such useless characters like the Blond girl, the Stoners, and the Careless Guy, put into this movie? It was obvious from the moment they stepped on screen (and from the trailers) that caring in any way for those characters was going to be like getting to know the Red-Shirted Ensigns from Star Trek! But, as I indicated by the rating, there is more to like than to dislike. There are a few ""shadow"" scenes that vaguely reference the other movies in the Alien and Predator franchises: The Predator ""praying"" over a fallen comrade (Predator 2); an Alien ""examining"" a potential victim (Alien 3); the Predalien peering through the medical curtain at it's next victim (Alien 3); an Alien plays fish in the town swimming pool (Alien Ressurrection); the Aliens scream, screech, and move like the ones from Aliens. The action scenes were perfect, and I actually found the tension building and the heartbeat hastening during the earth-shattering final confrontation! Also, the way the Predator showed off his hunting skills, which were far superior to any of the Hunter's we have seen before, made you almost want to cheer for the him.I don't know if there will be another movie in the Alien, Predator, or AvP franchises, or even if we need another movie, but AvP Requiem is a fine addition, worthy of it's name.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

734,gODGRINDER,Don't heed the haters,9,28 December 2007,"I'm going to preface this review with this disclaimer: I have been a rabid Predator and Aliens vs. Predator fan since I was 11. When I first saw the Alien skull in the trophy case in ""Predator 2,"" I often held out hope that one day the budgeting, the special-effects wizardry, and a gigantic performance actor (R.I.P. Kevin Peter Hall) would be available to bring my favorite comic book franchise of all time to the silver screen. I got my wish in 2004.The first AvP was a bit of a let-down (PG-13????!!!!!) in some respects, but a valiant effort in others. Paul Anderson did what he could to incorporate many aspects of the AvP mythos into the plot line (the first comic series, the video game, etc.), but it still kind of fizzled out in a lot of ways. The plot holes and crappy acting aside, I was beside myself seeing these iconic monsters battling it out before my eyes. And the emergence of the Predalien at the end literally left me salivating for a sequel.Fast forward 3 years and now we have ""AvP:R."" I'm not going to lie; when I first saw the trailer on YouTube last August, the thought of waiting four months to see this movie was almost too much to bear. That's how good it looked, even compared to the first AvP. This film picks up directly where the first left off, which spares us the agony of ""plot development"" and instead dives straight into the balls-out extra-terrestrial ultra-violence that we all paid to see. And for those who complain about the ""lack of plot,"" when you view the two parts as a whole, the first movie ended as the plot was still building. Maybe that helps, maybe it doesn't.All in all, most of the criticisms levied against this film are dead-on; two-dimensional characters, phoned-in performances, violence for violence's sake. Big deal. If you're the kind of person who experienced some sort of existential crisis when ""Dumb and Dumber"" didn't provide the answers to all of life's burning questions, then watching this movie is going to be extremely painful for you. The rest of us just want to have fun. Besides, look at the source material: While the premise was great, the comic book series aren't especially well-written (not counting, of course, the very first series from 1991 and Chris Claremont's ""Deadliest of the Species"" series from 1993-1994). Bottom line: This ain't Sundance and it sure as hell ain't Shakespeare in the Park, okay? The deficiency of the human actors notwithstanding, I really enjoyed some of the stuff they did with the Predator character this time around: A glimpse into their homeworld, dual shoulder-cannons, and an overall badassitude delivered in spades as the Aliens are dispatched in the nastiest manner possible. Very, very entertaining to watch and it had the little Predator-nerd in me jumping with glee.My only REAL problem with the film was the ending. The climactic showdown between the Predator and the Predalien was a bit anti-climactic. And the fight doesn't really matter anyway because they both get caught in a fireball after the Army orders a nuclear strike to ""contain the area"" (since when does the Army have the authority to dispatch F-22's?.....Oh, and in case you were wondering, the Colorado National Guard is not based in Colorado Springs. I live in Colorado Springs. I know.). At any rate, the nuke was a chicken$#it way to end the movie. I would have liked to have seen the Predator kill the Predalien and then find a way to stow onto the helicopter (GET TO THE CHOPPA!!) so as to escape the blast. But NOOOOOOOO. That wouldn't be fair to the Alien fans!! Pfft.All in all, this isn't the worst sci-fi movie ever made. I think that title could definitely be reserved for ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" or even ""Supernova."" This movie is fun, it's flashy, and it's gory. Don't read too much into it because you'll only be disappointed.A couple of side notes: Being a Colorado native, I would venture to guess that the decision to make Gunnison the backdrop for this film is quite appropriate being that the town is a major hub for hundreds of elk ""hunters"" from all over the state and the country.Also, if you've ever been to Gunnison, you know that there are worse ways to end a movie than having that town get blown up by a nuclear bomb. :)",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
735,corylol,At least it tried...,6,4 January 2008,"AVP1 was very crappy. Everything about it was a big letdown for me. Now after being severely disappointed by that film-- I figured they would have to do a lot better on a second. And.. I believe that they TRIED a little bit more for this film, but it still fell short of my expectations.Here's a slight spoiler part.It was pretty much Aliens 1 and 2 but with a Predalien and a Predator walking an' killing stuff too. The film definitely had a slasher feel to it-- as they could have easily subbed out the Aliens with Freddy or Jason. AVP2 had a definite focus on the Alien(s) aspect of the film with little Predator feel or thrill. And they had a girl (O'Brien) who was practically the Ripley of the movie who happened to be smart and bad-ass-- Just like Ripley! The movie fed way too much on the ""Oh the fan-boys would love this!"" factor-- leaving me, just a casual fan of the Predator and Alien films, feeling like the film was one long inside joke. The film also happened to feel like a literal squash of the Alien and Predator films, rather than a carefully planned medley of the two titles. The acting was slasher quality. The plot was... slasher. The Alien and Predator fighting scenes were AVP1 all over again for me.I can't say it was horrible, though. It could've been worse. The Predator could've teamed up with imitation-Ripley, made her an Alien head shield, and then fought the Predalien off the side of the Colorado Mountains.Since it didn't do that I'll give it a benefit-of-the-doubt 6 out of 10.

That being said, I always pay money at the theater to support films of this nature so the movie companies will continue to make more. SPOILERS: This AvP version had over the top violence, NO ONE was spared in the killing. The Strause Brothers wanted to make a serious, gritty horror film and take the movie back back to its roots, without losing sight of the human struggle. They definitely accomplished that in my opinion. There was a really cool shot of the Pred home world; the ""T"" clan leader was bad ass with a lot of cool new weapons and tech. I thought the first AvP wasn't too bad and I have been a fan of the Darkhorse books for years; hats off to Fox for allowing it to happen!

Was wondering why the AVP2 title is not ""Alien vs predator"" or ""Aliens vs Predators"". after all the title literally means what it says. coz there are many aliens and only ONE predator in this movie. so it becomes AlienS vs predator... i guess :D.i ran to watch this movie as soon as it was released in taiwan Jan 4th coz i like AVP. It really disappointed me. On the way home with my gf, we only blamed the plot holes of this movie. many commentors here have already pointed out the stupid plot holes.for me it doesn't seem like a big movie worth to show on cinema. it's just somehow similar to an episode of the TV series like x-files. Cheap and low-budget film. and the storyline is even similar to power rangers :D too simple and cheap.i really hoped to see new predator weapons and a big war among human soldiers, aliens and predators. that stupid predator took only 1 whip from his home and even took a tiny predator pistol and 2 stars from his dead predators. the worst are the actors in this movie. just not active and boring. it's like an amateur Horror director tried his best to make a Sci-fi movie as scary as possible hehe:D.one commenter mentioned here that every 10 minutes you'll say ""it doesn't make sense"".i confirmed :D. the whole movie i had to try hard to comprehend what was happening coz it's not consistent and too dark. i thought my eyes had some problem coz i play computer too much. but it's not. it's just that movie very dark and blur. the worst is the main scenes took place at night time and the electricity was cut off while it's raining. I didn't even see clear the WHOLE body of any alien. it shows only some parts like face, legs, and tails separately. that director should produce ""Aliens vs Zombies"" next time.sorry for my English.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
740,AspackadoArg,Plz stop now.,1,5 January 2008,"I just came home from the cinema and i must say, I expected more. Since i liked all the other alien movies (including AvP) I thought I was going to see another classic movie, but i didn't know how wrong i was...This movie separates a lot from all the other alien movies, witch not have to be bad, but in this case it is. It is really bad.Humans die all the time, even helpless children's, the cast is really bad, the dialogues is even worse then in Spiderman 3(witch is BAD) The story is non-existing and the movie is really dark, so u actually can't see clear when the predator fights the aliens, its just black contours and you wonder what just happened.The move is not worth the time or your money, this must be the end of the alien series.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
741,chadconnellmail,simply awful,1,6 January 2008,"Well, I put Alien, and Aliens in the top 25 movies I have ever seen...with that said, Alien 3 was bad. Alien Resurrection was pretty bad too. AVP was terrible, but this latest installment? Well, I should have known perhaps, but I took a chance and went to see ""Requiem"" last weekend. It simply blew my mind how awful this movie was. There was no suspense, no surprises, and was way worse than the first AVP!!! I did not think it was possible, but this movie was pathetic in every way. Stupid lines, bad acting, and typical action sequences- nothing new here at all. Please save yourself the trip and avoid this movie. I really hope this is the last AVP-it is simply not going to work. Bring back Aliens 4 or 5...have the setting be some distant planet - and make it dark, dreary, frightening, and some cool characters-that is what made Alien and Aliens so good, and that is what this genre needs.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
742,neil_helm,It was slightly better than OK.,7,9 January 2008,I am a huge fan of the alien series. Resurrection was my least favorite. Aliens was my favorite. AVP was surprisingly good. AVP2 was not as good as AVP in my opinion. It lacks the tense and suspenseful feel that most of the series has. It was still an enjoyable film though.It seems like I never really got a good look at the Predalien. (I don't think that would qualify as a spoiler if you've seen AVP1 and I don't think many people who haven't seen AVP1 will be watching AVP2.)I thought the acting was good. I didn't recognize too many people in the cast but they all performed well. They tried to develop a lot of characters quickly and ended up making them seem a little shallow.7 of 10. Still a cool movie compared to other stuff out there.,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
743,mayorofshembo,A Disservice to Fans of Either Series,3,15 November 2010,"(Spoilers Likely Ahead)I'd like to open by saying that I did enjoy the first AvP movie, for what it was. I did not expect a true horror film out of it because the two series have different horror approaches. Aliens was largely about claustrophobia. By that, I mean being stuck in space, deep in the hallways of a colony, etc... being stuck with this relentless monster. Predator was more about wider spaces, more about the world around you and that this thing stalking you can be anywhere and get you with immediate force. So with AvP, I wasn't expecting horror or a thriller like either series' stand-alone movies. As a monster versus monster slugfest, it gave me what I wanted.However, this is a review for AvP:R. Which, I will go on to describe, is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. One thing a lot of people disliked about the first AvP is its focus on character development. Or rather, perhaps, people having more screen time than the titular monsters; screen time that these people are not being violently killed. AvP:R seems to address this by giving us characters we could not possibly care less about. You've seen all of these characters and situations before. You can practically set your watch to the upcoming ""jealous boyfriend-guy beats up pizza guy, throws his keys down the sewer."" Its been done a hundred times before. My friend loved this movie, upon learning this I challenged him to name a single character in it. Predictably, he could not. Also, for having less character development and time on the screen, it seems the hackneyed lives of these people drone on forever. You get your opening Predalien- Beating-Up-Predators scene, followed by what seems like an eternity of cliché people-plot, especially bad for a movie trying(?) to address fanboys' cries for less people living, more people dying.Speaking of the Predalien, it unfortunately does nothing to add character to either series. Its even been done before in a computer game years ago, before it faded into obscurity, before returning now, and then returning again to obscurity. While some folks liked it's direct- implantation of chestbursters into women (specifically women, I guess), I found it to be ridiculously out of place. If these creatures adopt their parent-species' traits, then where did this come from? It seems like just an easy route to some stupid gore. Also, it did not seem particularly deadly when killing all the Predators on the ship in the opening sequence, it only made the Predators look dumber than rocks and just as graceful. One last nitpick... when Wolf is standing there at the final battle, why does the Predalien just stand nearby, waiting patiently for him to remove his mask in a lengthy and unnecessarily overdone fashion? On to Wolf, now that I've complained enough about the one side, I'll throw some complaints at the Predators. Wolf is a badass. I'll give him that one... but I never got the idea he was so skilled he could take this threat alone. Compared to the Aliens, he gets painfully little screen time. If I'm wrong, then it only serves to support my claim that nothing is going on in this film, so much that I can't remember one of the titular creatures doing much of anything. It seems his skills are no more than any other Predator's, he just has better weaponry. He spends a lot of time skulking around, doing not much of anything, occasionally fighting, but not so impressively that I'd consider him one of the finest warriors of a whole dang planet of fine warriors. Again to my earlier nitpick, but just on the other side, why is he disarming and taking off his mask (in a long and overly done fashion) with this alien (who should be) charging at him? Just seems like a way to hearken back to the original Predator revealing its ugly mug, only not nearly as well done. The gore is spilled by the bucket, but unintelligently and without style. The movie is so dark you can barely tell what's going on, and a lot of the violence that we want is either so dark, so extremely close up, or both, that it's completely obscured and confusing. Some people liked the women and children being killed, but I thought it was tasteless. Take it away and we get the PG-13 rating that everyone scoffed at in the original AvP.To conclude, its a dumb romp in the dark, with either nothing going on or nothing you're able to see going on. You won't care about the people, but its not an improvement from the first AvP if you didn't like all the people in that. You'll want to like this movie, but I doubt you will. The Predalien is kind of neat, but doesn't add to either series. Wolf is a badass, but every Predator is, and it doesn't seem he's adding much to the Preds before him, despite his status. If you want horror, watch Alien. If you want a thriller, watch Predator. Don't watch this.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
744,rnabessosu,"Sucked, Sucked, Sucked, Sucked...Did I mention it sucked?",2,25 January 2008,"Holy crap, the beginning picked up where the first one left off (good start). Then it goes downhill from there. You it looked like as if you were watching TV and you keep on switching between this teenage soap opera, a Predator movie, and some crappy detective show. The characters that are introduced in the first ten minutes don't have anything to do with each other until the final 45 minutes or so (the characters of the teenage soap opera and the actual Alien story).Then for the end the producers were quickly running out of money and decided to end the movie so they decided to drop a nuke on the city.P.S- What the crap is the deal with the cameras being so zoomed in you can't tell what's going on? Seriously, movie makers, do a good job with fight scenes and make it to where we can see the fight.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
745,agentgates,Complete waste of money,1,1 February 2008,"The worst movie in the Alien/Predator categories. Due to the ending of the first AVP movie I was expecting a lot from this. I thought it is going to be great, well designed work, but after the first fifteen minutes I was so angry...There are three main problems make this movie dog food.Alien ship crashes. Predator general/boss/lord/squire/whatever watching transmitted CCTV records of the ship on Predator's planet, he saw the Predalien. He is in the hurry. The trouble is big. I was expecting he will call a few other well-trained Predators and they will go to Earth together. No, this guy says NOTHING and goes alone. Okay, I trust the guy, he's going to do something extraordinary.Now he's on Earth in the forest where the ship went down. He makes a basic research in the ship then destroys the wreckage. Now it is clear for the audience probably he will destroy all the evidences. Then he's destroying corpses hit by the Alien. He's following them in the tunnel, cleaning after them. Then once he runs into a policeman watching him behind. He kills, skins the guy and pulls him up to a tree. That was when first I said to myself: ""it's non-sense"". He's so busy to hide everything then once he brutally kills someone and leaves the corpse where people will find it. The whole work before was waste of time. There were so many chances to make a good scene... (e.g. The policeman's keep following him, LONG TIME following him! He can see what he's doing and he has time to be in dread of Predator. Maybe the Predator can hear a noise in the forest on the front of him and he quickly turns the camouflage on. And now our guy is shaking, getting swallowing he's fist: ""Mother of god."" The Predator is seeking on the front of him for the noise, using the laser, still in camouflage. Our guy's starting to lose self-control, Predator can hear our guy's movement. The guy is trying to keep himself behind the tree, now the P. is seeking behind where our guy is. He can't see him yet because the tree. But our guy also can not see him in the camouflage. Predator is approaching the tree, our guy is still behind the tree and trying to stay in the opposite side where he believes the Predator is. Then NOW the radio VERY QUICKLY, the guy's keep turning scared, he looks behind but ""somebody"" is already waiting there. And NOW comes a blade.)This is the first main problem with this movie: nobody is scared. Including the little approx. 6-year-old girl, who is actually a witness of her father's brutal murder? She sees AvP fights, dead bodies, a 'cheap woman' fixed to the wall by a star and there is no sign of mental trauma? If nobody is scared, the audience is also not scared. If the audience is not scared in a horror movie, the whole thing is waste of time and money.So, Predator's moving on, killing Aliens, Predaliens by weapons, by hands - either simultaneously, then once he probably takes a look at his watch: ""oops, end is coming, so now I need to drop weapons, mask"" and he begins a fight by hand with - probably not the last  less significant Predalien. Why?This is second main problem in this movie: nobody is thinking.Fights: to fast, too dark, zoom is too in; camera is switching positions too often: opponents can not be tracked and distinguished well. When they're having a short break audience can maybe find out who got the last punch from the previous round.There is a young woman who decides a jump from a guy to another as monkey from tree to tree in the Jungle. Then she fires the guy, reports it to the other one: ""okay, my now I am ready"". Is it the accepted way as people are doing over there? Was it necessary to set these people in 'positive' role in a movie that millions will see?Then let's see the brutal scenes. Was it also really necessary to put pregnant women in a sci-fi horror movie and get killed like this?? Isn't there any feeling of human dignity too? Then the kid in the forest awfulHowever created this movie, have a quite distorted vision or social ambient.And this is the third main problem, the largest one in this movie: creators are also not thinking - which can be the cause of its failure in my eye.This movie was a bin of rubbish; I am not going to buy it on DVD and probably my friends are also included.There were 3 nice scenes too - but they're still not making this movie any better in my eye. The Alien and the father through the window, the human-eating-Alien gets a pike in the head, and the one at the power station Predator's walking on the bridge and the Predalien's following him quietly underneath.Avoid this movie. :-(",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
746,Hawklan_D,Another souless cash in on the franchises,2,2 February 2008,"This is a poor film. The only small saving graces that can be salvaged from it are those brief but flawed insights into predator culture. Those small flashes however were explored and abandoned within the first 10 minutes of the film, in order to make way for the gory horror-fest that this film tried to be. It fails because it's not even any good at doing that. If you want a gory alien invasion film set in present day America, see Slither - you'll be much more entertained.The rest of this picture consisted of tepid character development, including a wonderfully pointless teenage angst girl struggle with the obligatory jock and his cronies. The acting was at best adequate, but did it's job to service the director's apparent goals: gory alien action and cool deaths with explosions.I'm genuinely baffled as to whether the rights holders for these two pedigree science fiction franchises either cannot (through lack of available talent), or will not (through some baffling and incorrect cost/benefit marketing formula) attempt to reproduce the tension, horror and vivid visceral action of their forebears. I don't know if either can even be saved now that they've had this done to them.If you're the most rabid Alien or Predator fan you might want to see this movie just to witness those creations on the big screen again, but if you genuinely admire and enjoy such great films as Predator, Alien and Aliens then you'll probably come away feeling slightly sickened, if only because the satisfaction you were looking for isn't to be found in this film.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
747,uber-trasher,This is just sad..,1,13 February 2008,"This movie is maybe the worst movie I ever saw, because I always hope that a new alien or predator or AvP will not suck. This one sucks big time.If anyone wants to see a bloodbath, I am sure there are Rob Zombie or just zombie movies to satisfy these needs.If you know anything about aliens or predators from earlier movies, none of that applies here. Nothing makes sense. Whoever wrote the story, probably is not much smarter than George W. Bush. The storyline is so infantile that no one could ever consider it to be possible in any way. Not to mention that there are some pretty serious f***ups.I think it is enough to mention that a predator himself has crashed his ship on Earth. Plus, ""cannon"" on his shoulder barely damages concrete sewers but is capable to shoot down an advanced faster-than-light starship. Predalien has grown from chest burster to adult in just a few minutes, if not seconds. Aliens have somehow forgotten that their tails are their deadliest weapons. Predator wrist bomb, for which we know from the previous movies to have a power of a mini-nuke is now degraded to a firecracker. Middle aged man and his child son can cross several miles through forest and over the mountains in just a few minutes. Every sheriffs best friends must be criminals. If somebody chops your arm off, you still have a fer hours before you bleed to death. And so on, and so on..I mean, why would anyone do this to these lovable and charismatic aliens, to humiliate them so? It must be a work of some really mean people. I hope they never film another movie and catch a genital herpes.If action scenes were great, I would be partly satisfied. But they are not. They suck to. You can't see a thing because the camera man couldn't hold the camera still. It didn't work for Bournes Ultimatum, why did they think it will work for them? Plus, all the fights are so predictable, you always know who is going to die. For example, there was only one predator here, so you know he won't die until the end.Crap, crap, crap, crap..",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
748,markitect-1,i'm sorry James Cameron,2,28 April 2008,"I really do not know where to begin... I seriously don't.To quote a Simpson's character and say ""worst movie ever"" would be giving this film far too much credit. Even if one was to detach their brain and mindlessly stare at the TV, they'd be disappointed (probably by the fact they wouldn't see much due to the film's awful lighting) but honestly, there are far too many things wrong about this film, first of all the fact that it exists! OK, i don't need to tell you whats wrong with it, there's been enough people who have done that, and if I had one good thing to say about it I would, but i honestly don't. If i struggled for compliments I'd normally say ""well the soundtrack was... OK"" but I can't even say that! It uses (far too much) scores from the original soundtrack, and during the end scene which poorly attempts to echo the end of ""aliens"" the tried to use the same score and obviously re-recorded it but got it wrong! I honestly can't review this film seriously, so i'm going to end with by saying it successfully stamps the alien franchise further into the ground than anyone thought possible, and as for the predator, the incredible, alert, aware and dangerous predator we all know, has been replaced by an overweight blind kid, with no sense of spacial awareness.Basically, the worst film I've ever seen.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
749,Jason_of_moss,Back to the glory days of film (in this genre),10,2 March 2008,"There were so many mistakes in the first AVP film, I really didn't think they were really going to make a second. They may have set it up for a sequel, but everyone had so much hate for what Paul Anderson had made, I thought FOX would read all that and say forget it. Paul Anderson IS the worst director ever(Uwe Boll is still trying to take that title), and deciding that he could take the inner-workings of 2 established films and change them because HE has a different vision, is the worst move a director make, and a slap in the face to every fan. Here comes the spoilers...There were only a few things that could be salvaged from Paul's junk, the Pred-Alien hybrid was OK, the Aliens being on earth was fine, and Lance playing Weyland. The 10 on the calendar crap, JUNK. I don't want to sit here and list everything that was wrong with the film, it'll take too long. So I'll just move on to THE MOVIE.In this new film, the Predator went back to what he was in the 2 Predator films. A killer, not sparing anyone, not making anyone an honorary predator. Just killing, hunting, and cleaning up an Alien mess. Giving everyone a peek at the Predator planet was a pretty sweet tidbit. He was skinning and hanging people up, and it was so close to how it was in the original Predator, it made me feel better to see it. I grew up on these 2 franchises, so I wanted something that didn't fall too far from them. For Predator films, this was great.The Aliens in the films also took no prisoners, impregnating a father and son hunting team was something that would have never been done had another moron written the script. New Hollywood has Lost touch with what made Old Films great. Everyone wants to put spin and style on everything instead of focusing to story. Also going where audience does not expect, like killing characters that everyone freaks out over. Or in this films case just say ""OH man! They killed his Girlfriend!?!"" When the Military was called in to help the town rid itself of the alien problem, it was like watching ALIENS with the marines coming in and stomping the pizza out of everything (and taking a few casualties of their own).Overall, this movie has left me with great hope for a future AVP, and even reopens doors for another Alien and Predator film. Even though this movie didn't leave an opening for a sequel(NUKE style), writers can always find a way to make them. Besides, somehow there is Aliens in the far future. And other planets.

750,mmmmiiiicccc,I'm a sad panda,4,4 March 2008,This is what happens when Hollywood tries to quickly cash in on something they know not what ensuring that any future it may have had dies quick and fast. I wish there was enough knocking around between my two ears after watching this movie to provoke a thought that might spill out into 10 lines of text. I have to tell you..this is truly painful. A cast of nobodies that obviously came at minimum charge to make way for maximum spending by two visual effects supervisors moonlighting as directors. Boys...stick to your day jobs. A note to Hollywood...take queues from the music industry. When we think you have a product worth paying for we might think about sending you a little cash. IMO I wish I had downloaded it using my neighbors wireless Internet and even then it would have been a waste of their bandwidth and my time.,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
751,yenthaw,what I missed about AVP2,1,15 April 2008,"Predator 1 and 2 were great pop-art films. AVP had an OK theme but was still watchable and gripping. As far as the Predator goes, the kid in us loves to create extensions to ourselves (add-ons / clip-ons to our laptops, ipods, etc.). The Predator was one big swiss army knife. What made him (?) great were the extentions. The shoulder gun, the view-finder, the collapsible spear (could have been better), the portable surgical centre (could have been better again!), the mask and finally the wrist knife (a la wolverine) among others. In AVP2, they totally stripped the Predator to normalcy. To add insult to injury, the shoulder gun became a hand gun. One could've easily replaced the characters of this film to be zombies versus living dead with humans caught in between (whats new?) and nothing changes. The only redemption for this movie could be (1)humans visiting the Predator planet after improving on design armour and weaponry; (2) resurrect the ""Predalien"" and equip it with more add-ons / clip-ons; (3) continue with earth as playground and have aliens+predators versus the ""Aliator""; (4) weirder would be one with an uncontrollable creature hybrid of human+alien+predator (the Humiliator - ROTFLMAO) on earth in the first half and wreaking havoc on the alien and predator planets in the second half of the film (make it a 3 hour movie this time)!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
752,imdb-eurisko,The eulogy of the AvP franchise.,1,23 April 2008,"This movie is god-awful.I will not even waste any time to describe the ""character development"" and ""setup"" parts of this movie, which take up roughly the first half (not even joking, more than 50 minutes pass before any human fires a shot) of the movie. Suffice to say that it's the generic ""man who is a criminal but a good guy at heart and also good friends with a cop"" and ""teenage high school romance"" plots which share a loose connection.You can safely let the movie run in the background and browse forums or other pages for the first half and won't miss a thing. You have seen it all in thousands of variations already. Or you could just skip ahead to the 50 minute mark. Of course you won't know who any of the characters are if you do, but then again you don't really care and you wouldn't care even if you had watched the entire movie up until this point.So let's get to the stuff that we all want to see: The action scenes.Well, we want to see them... but we can't. The movie is too damn dark. I envied the kid for the pair of night vision goggles she had, maybe I should have put on a pair as well to make out what goes on in half of the scenes.The darkness adds absolutely nothing to the movie. Darkness is mainly used in movies to add to a claustrophobic atmosphere, or to create a feeling of uneasiness and fear. It worked perfectly in Alien and Aliens, where the darkness sometimes hid aliens and other times just seemed to play tricks on the protagonists, where it created a genuine feeling of paranoia. Did something move back there? Was it an alien? Oh turns out it's just a chain hanging from the ceiling.Here it does nothing but hide how dumb the aliens look and obscure the action scenes. We already know the aliens are there, we are shown well beforehand. Please, dear aspiring directors, unless your movie is a horror thriller, do NOT shroud the setting in complete and utter darkness. I thought that this movie could not physically get any darker after the first few minutes, but what do you know, it managed by having the city's power plant blown up by the predator for pretty much no reason.The people don't act like people. I mean aside from their wooden delivery of lines which they barely seem to remember, they don't act like normal people would in many situations. The main beef I have with the people, though, is that the viewer cares not one iota about them at any point in the movie. Really, they might as well all have looked the same and worn white t-shirts which say ""generic alien food"" on them. Hell, they might even just have been bags full of red paint, that's pretty much all they were used as anyway. Humans are little more than lab rats to be murdered as sadistically as possible. The maternity ward scene, for example, was... weird. I am by no means a squeamish person, but it felt wrong. It was more like the director wanted to see just how much disturbing violence he can get away with before it's no longer Fox producing his movie, but Troma. The violence also has almost no impact because, again, we do not care about the victims.The aliens have lost all their allure. In the ""Alien"" franchise they were horrifying creatures, so single-minded in their mission to propagate and kill, and yet one could not help but wonder if there was more than instinct beneath their shiny shell, perhaps some form of frightening intelligence, which was very plausible given how skilled the aliens were at employing not only brute strength, but also clever tactics and baffling set-ups in their hunt for humans. In this movie, aliens are little more than generic space critters to be blown to hell by the predator.The predator is also toned down a lot because there is no ""vendetta"" in this movie, as there was in the Predator movies (Arnold vs the Predator in the first movie, Danny Glover vs the Predator in the second). The lack of an ongoing feud makes humans as well as the Predator much less interesting.Simply put, I hope that this movie will be the final nail in the coffin of the AvP franchise. Much like a person who is down does not deserve to be kicked, AvP does not deserve another god-awful movie.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
753,G_Train,"Not Great, But Not As Bad As Most People Say.",6,20 April 2008,"I didn't read any reviews of AvPR before going to see it, as I feel they skew the experience, but afterward I read several to see how the movie was received, and I'm disappointed at the number of people who are bagging this movie, when simply compared to previous Alien titles.I loved the original Alien movies, 1 & 2 especially, not so much 4 and I disliked 3, and while AvP1 wasn't a smash hit, it had the elements and hallmarks present that made the original Predator and Alien movies a hit, and the same can be said for AvPR.The movie is slanted toward horror and gore, rather then the suspense that made the originals so unique, and while thats not my cup of tea, I did enjoy the action and thrill of the movie that was there.When you compare AvPR to the original Alien or Predator movies, I agree that it in no way stacks up, but thats comparing it to the best in the business. The originals were ground breaking, unique and hit a much more innocent audience, these days you need to do *ALOT* to stun an audience, and I think that's why these additions are being so poorly received.AvPR for me was like the movie Doom, had little to nothing to do with it's roots, which is aggrivating, but expected, and yet despite that was still entertaining from a purely action/horror movie standing point. This was a decent Horror flic with great CGI and several plot twists, was it a credit to the Alien or Predator franchise, no - but you'd want to make one hell of a movie these days to compare to a classic of that caliber.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

AVP R is filled by tons of references, from obvious to subtle, from every past movies, a very nice touch for the old fans, which usually are back stabbed, here we have a movie for us,what do you think about for example, having the good old Silvestri's drums from the original Predator movie back ? And several times ! I've seen AVP R 4 times in theaters, and of course i bought the DVD, the DVD has 7 extra minutes and they are worth it believe me ! Yeah i went out the theater with a smile, the same smile i had 17 years ago when i went out after Predator 2 screening, Back to the ROOTS ! With AVP R you can't miss.10/10",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
755,elmoremj-1,A dark day for the franchise,3,2 May 2008,"By far the worst Alien/Predator film of all time, for half the film you could've been watching someone shaking a camera in the dark. Barely any plot and a lack of Alien vs Predator action results in a film that disappoints in stunning fashion. The second half of the film picked up a little but I was more than tempted to switch off in the opening 45 minutes when I could barely remain concentrated on what I was watching. The acting is also extremely substandard with very little in the way of noticeable stars (I knew the guy from Rescue me and the chick from 24). Someone needs to breath fresh life into what should be a great product, hey who doesn't want to see Aliens and Predators at war.In short get yourself plugged into some Aliens (the second in the alien franchise) and Predator (the original) two great films that can be watched time and time again.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
756,dancl78,Utter dross - a crime against the Alien and Predator originals.,1,13 June 2008,"Alien/predator movie for people with short attention spans. I hated this film, and couldn't wait for it to end. My favorite alien movie was ALIENS. One of the most suspense filled scenes in movie history I reckon was in ALIENS when Riply went back down into the bowls of the self destructing colony to try and find Newt. There was nothing like this here. You didn't get to know the characters. There were some (weak) attempts at character building right at the start - guy comes back to town after serving time in jail and a woman comes back to town after being away in the army, but these were not expanded on in the slightest, not at all.Films like this used to be made by passionate people for passionate movie fans. This was just utter drivel to try and get bums on seats by cashing in on a couple of fantastic movie franchises. A big disappointment. Please leave other classics alone until you have people of the right caliber to make them.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
757,torpormeister,first: catharsis. now i could cry.,5,17 July 2008,"Pro: finally our beloved extraterrestrials are back in action! cute little children, pregnant women can't escape the aliens either! I'm not bothered by the fact that we don't get to know too much about the human characters, because we aren't meant to. it helps us bear to see them die. I think one of the main goals of this movie was to show how vulnerable we humans are. this rampage, the seemingly never ending flow of blood was like when a child goes to a candy shop - for me. not the ""story"" itself, but the way things happen was fairly new to me and I like it. I mean the uncut version is ""brilliantly violent"". for a bloody movie, it is excellent.Contra: I think I can say that I'm a die-hard A, P, AvP fan. I've seen all the movies many times, read books, played the video games, once I even had an RPG tale with Predators in it. this is why I would prefer to call this movie something else, like ""ufo rampage in the USA"". I mean it's a shame that apart from the stolen elements (apc, music, characters, etc all mentioned before by others) being nostalgic, there is nothing new (the Predalien isn't new at all) that could make smile (an evil smile, like when one of the aliens killed the other to get out in Resurrection). it's like in the video game that the Predator would need a pickup to carry so many gear that he has on him. aliens just come and go, lacking any ""team spirit"", hiding outside the lens of the camera, not between tubes and wires or that wet organic stuff that they lay everywhere. it's just like a bad fan-video. I agree with the previous comments: great actors, director(s), story, budget needed for the coming sequels! but first and foremost: respect the prequels!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
758,lln-d,Just terrible,1,30 July 2008,"When I was about to watch this movie I was thinking this had to be better than it's predecessor,well I was about to find out.The movie starts of where AVP left off. The predator ship crashes on earth.The movie rushes from then on. Well anyway a high predator finds out that a predalien is on earth and goes off and hunts for it. More aliens are produced and more people are killed.The acting is terrible and there is not one famous actor in the whole movie.From all the great actors like Schwarzengger,Weaver,Paxton,Hurt,Weathers,Glover and Perlman they cant get one A-list actor.A band of people then keep together for a chance of survival.The actors were speaking terrible dialogue eg:people are dying we need guns. A lot of the time I just couldn't see aliens and a predator kicking each others butt's because It was so dark. I was wondering why was there was only one predator in the film. The ending didn't make it any better. This movie was a let down and the Strause brothers should never go near a camera again.The series is really in deep trouble and may be the end of the franchise which started so well with alien and predator.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
759,jwhitehead25,Horrible pile of crap,1,23 July 2008,"This movie sucks so much crap, I fast fowarded this movie to all the great scenes and the total time was 15 minutes, The rest was boring crap.The scenes that involved the pregnant lady about to give birth, and the baby ward or whatever you call it was in bad taste. these brothers obviously truly suck at making a movie cause this is a waste of time to watch. The predators from A.V.P. were twice the size of this predator and in this movie there is only 1 predator in the entire movie taking on all the aliens and he obviously failed since they bombed the place. A.V.P. had way more aliens and made it more entertaining. This movie gave me the runs",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
760,smit-20,Just a very good sci-fi action movie!!,7,24 July 2008,Saw this movie today. Didn't expect the movie to be very good regarding the most opinions posted before. I'm a fan of the aliens/predator movies so didn't wanted to miss this latest version. I was very pleasant surprised. This movie simply rocks!! The special- and sound effects are about some of the best I saw/heard in a long time (and I do see a lot of movies). The predator and aliens sound really threating and the other sound effects and music are just keeping you connected. The story and actors ain't too complicated but to me that's no problem with these kind of movies. It has enough speed and depth. To me this movie really belongs in the(sub)top of it's class!,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
761,ButrzV2,"In the word's of Comic Book Guy- ""Worst movie ever!""",3,24 July 2008,"What the hell Fox was thinking when they accepted this script is beyond me. I am about the biggest AVP fan that there is, but I was just so disappointed in it. I think that the main problem in this film...scratch that. The main three problems in this film are:1) the acting.Normally, you'd expect it in a movie like this. the sci-fi/horror genre has never had good luck when it comes to acting. Mostly because everyone in a every horror movie dies. But it was just pathetic. There was never anyone you wanted to live. Each Alien/Predator movie has had someone who you wanted to live, someone who would live, normally, a human. You're supposed to be able to root for the humans! Not this time. Ten minutes in, I just wanted everyone dead. Dallas was the only respectable character in this whole frickin movie, and I still wanted him to get killed.2)The story.If there is such a thing. The story was practically non-existent, the whole film was subplots and bullcrap. Too many things were trying to happen, when really, there should have just been guns. Lots of guns, and lots of Predator/Alien/Human killing. Which there really wasn't. The first AVP had a distinguishable story, with 3 predators. The one in this movie is not enough. Several more should have been added for at least a little variation. The predator spends more than half the movie trying to cover everything up, even when things blow way beyond his control. The screen time is wasted with the pointless romantic bull, and everybody has a problem other than the strange creatures in their town.3) The end.I'll try to do as little spoiling as possible, but don't count on anything. The ending sucked. The first AVP had that chick wandering through the Arctic with nothing but that tiny sweater (which she could hardly fill anyway), and that was a pretty bad ending. But this one...AUUGGHH!!! It seems so anti-climactic it makes me want to scream. It hardly has an ending! The whole movie just ends so abruptly it makes the thing pointless. And the way it ended was just as bad.I absolutely abhorred it. The whole movie was lame. To put it plainly, it was lame. The 2 most disappointing parts for me were the lack of pulse rifles (Aliens). If I had just seen one damn pulse rifle, it might have earned a slightly better score. And the predator. He was downright pathetic. The great scenes in P1 and P2 where the predator removes his mask were just that, great. I mean freaking epic. AVP:R has that scene, but it is wasted on the hybrid Predalien. I mean, the hybrid doesn't understand the importance of that gesture.To put it simply, I hated it. All I see this film being, is a modern B movie. And after all the A's that the Alien and Predator films were, I have to say, that the hour and a half that you have to sit through for this movie is just not worth it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
762,Blacklight101,I stand out,7,14 October 2008,"Alien vs Predator 2 Requiem has its flaws and its a bit like a teen drama but still its not meant to be the 'next big thing' or one of the greatest movies made, its a entertaining movie with both of my most loved E.T's in it. People often complained about the teen drama parts but guys. Its. In.A .Small.Sleepy.Town. What do you expect, they had to to create a realistic setting but i wish they toned down on the teen thing. I excuse the fact that it had over-the-top gore but in my opinion even if it is to much gore it doesn't take anything away from the movie. All in all this is a good film with some noticeable flaws but entertaining.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
763,elias-antares,vulgarly bad,1,7 November 2008,"This was my second attempt to watch this. First time I've managed to endure 20min of it. Several weeks later(today) tried to watch it again,but had to stop watching it after 15 minutes(skipped first 20) Whoooooaaaa it's BAD! Lets start with the dynamics of this flick. When you make a no-plot action flick (like this one is), the emphasis should be on sequence composition.Meaning that it should have a strong buildup of action/tension/rhythm... Sequences should contrast each other as much as possible ensuring viewers attention via skillful introduction of unexpected...blah...blah... This flick has no quality in that composing aspect and it has non other arguments in it's defense (except for bad acting). What bothered me most are graphic scenes where babies and pregnant women were killed by aliens. I understand that this sorry attempt should suggest how uncompromising this movie is.But it's not uncompromising- it is just vulgar and bad.Some boundaries shouldn't be tempered with in this types of movies(considering the type of market this film was targeted for)This last remark is the main reason why I am writing this comment.Other than that this piece of garbage flick doesn't deserve slightest bit of attention...",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
764,mattwright139-1,I think I am now blind!,6,22 December 2009,"why is this film made, so it is completely pitch black throughout? It would of been a much better film if we could actually see what the hell was going on. Because what was going on was really good, but they should of shot it so you can recognise, whats what. Yes I do realise why they did it, because that was the style of aliens and predators, to not see them fully, but most of the time your supposed to see what happened at the beginning. But yes quite disappointing, in that case, otherwise, quite a god film, obviously only if you like just a plain battle with one of the most stupid story lines ever, but i don't care about that, that's why i enjoyed the first one, but if you want to see, watch the first one! :)",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
765,kieronmiddleton,Not as good as the first AVP,3,17 November 2008,"I would whole heartedly agree with the previous users comments ""ignorepeter"" that ""It was the pacing and the lack of tension that killed the movie for me."" This pretty much sums up the movie for me too. However, I would like to add another couple of comments which really affected how I enjoyed (or didn't enjoy) this movie.The first is that there didn't seem to be any decision by the director as to who's side anyone was on...the humans, aliens and predators all seemed to be ""every man for themselves"" where as in the 1st AVP, I quite liked the way the predator species teamed up with the human to beat the aliens. The aliens came across as mindless killing machines whereas, the predators and humans seemed to share a ""hunting ancestry"" which tied the two species together. I liked that.The second and possibly most important point is that I truly believe the directors touched on a raw nerve in this film when they decided to include harm to children and more significantly pregnant women. There is an unspoken rule about what is acceptable in gore/horror movies and I'm sure pregnant women being impregnated by aliens orally, then killed counts as one of the more emotionally disturbing things I've seen in a very long time. This kind of thing makes me wonder if the director was just out for the shock value or if he really has no moral compass at all. That one scene alone for me ruined the film. Too far mate, too far.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

But not this its a piece of sh**. The lines were awful these people cant act to save there lives. You really wish everyone would DIE!! It is truly awful... These Directors have no clue what made the old ones great and just said to each other ""Lets make AVP a B movie F*** those masterpieces"" Its not like they wrote a script did they NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

767,allstarcassella,AVPR is very entertaining with great action,10,23 March 2009,"The Brothers Strause did a very good job with their directing debut. At first when Fox hired them I wondered if Fox lost it. Then after I saw the AVPR I was amazed. The movie had great special effects and good action scenes. Not to mention a great Predator character. The Predalien is also cool, not quite as cool as the Queen Alien but still cool. The R rating is also a very good move by Fox. Visually the movie is very entertaining and the dialogue isn't as good as Predator1. There are one or two memorable lines. Reiko Ayleworth does agood job as the army woman so does John Ortiz and Stephen Pasquale does an OK job playing the bad boy.With many good thrilling fight scenes, Aliens Vs. Predator-Requiem is agreat watch.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
768,ben_rodda,Bloody Terrible,1,13 September 2009,"Alien is my favourite movie of all time. As near a perfect movie as you can get. In fact the alien franchise is my favourite franchise too. I even loved both the underrated Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection. Oh, and predator's pretty good too.I recently watched this abomination with a mate. He summarised the entire movie perfectly. ""I could have saved them a crap-load of money. I would have just filmed a black wall for 2 hours."" Thats basically the movie; pitch darkness. Some movies are dark and gloomy to set the mood, this movie is dark and gloomy to the extent you can't see a thing. Which is probably a good thing because what you do see is terrible. You actually want the characters to be killed off so you don't have to put up with them anymore.The Alien used to be the most terrifying on screen creation ever. It was truly terrifying (and still is, but in Alien only),because you barely saw it. It was always in the shadows,not knowing what its intent was, filling you with paranoia. Now its image is thrown in your face, with several aliens on screen at once and it's shown as a dumb beast, not the intelligent, frightening being it actually is.Alien vs Predator is an interesting concept, but in my opinion should never been made into a movie. Especially not set on Earth. It alienates (apt don't you think?) alien fans especially, since Ripley spent most of her life trying to stop the aliens from getting to Earth in the first place, only to have them already be there hundreds of years before her anyway? It basically destroys everything she did before she even did it. Unforgivable.If you want to be terrified watch Alien. If you want action watch Aliens and/or Predator. If you simply must have AvP, play the video games, they're actually pretty good, not set on earth and doesn't take anything away from either franchise.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
769,toptenjesus,Major Spoiler,1,6 June 2009,"You can't see anything. I don't know what I watched.I do know that they seem to have taken all of the popular aspects from the original two sets of films, the video games, the books, and the comics and threw all of that out. Then they took the really boring stuff and invented more boring stuff, and put all of that in.How about this? 1) Turn the lights on. 2) Bring in some Space Marines. 3) Load up on awesome guns. 4) Major battle. 5) Blockbuster. 6) Billion dollar spin off market for toys, comics, video games, and more movies.The most popular Alien movie was Aliens, because there were Space Marines and guns.The most popular Predator movie was the first one, because it had Soldiers with guns.Ever since those two movies they have done their best to take all the coolness and action out. These aren't detective movies, they're action movies. They aren't period pieces going for the most accurate sets and costumes, they're action movies. Load up on guns and fighting already!Stupid movie execs...",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
770,dippy_doppy,Poor,3,3 March 2012,"I watched the first alien vs predator as a kid, yes, a kid which is already a bad thing. My parents were very strict on what i watched and they said this was fine to watch. To long time fans of both alien and predator, this is already a bad thing. A showdown between monsters from two famously R-rated films in a 'epic' battle, and yet gore and violence is very scarce and tame. The film itself was a huge disappointment, boring, slow and don't even get me started on the ending.A few years on, we are given a sequel, aliens vs predator: reqeum, taken on this time by the brothers strauss, a completely new spin on an already ruined idea. I'm glad that they decided to continue on from the ending of the first (the very last scene) because that is the part i found most exiting. This time round we are promised a R rated approach, strong language, violence and gore, does it deliver? Yes and no. Whilst present it is also very brief and mild. Blood splatters and, to be honest, some quite cool decapitations. I think the thing that annoyed me the most about the violence and gore was how they didn't take any risks and didn't try anything new, and by that they literally stole half the kills from there predecesors, straight out of predator they stole the hanging upside down and skinning of the victim and also the aliens tongue execution. The shots were choppy making it hard to make out whats going on. The writing was appalling, they stole lines for example 'get to the chopper!' and i honestly think the helicopter evac at the end was only there for the expense of the reference, but thats not the worst part of the writing, i found that more often than not the writers made a desperate attempt to make another classic catch phrase like the 'get to the chopper' line but failed miserably, i think the brothers knew that this film would be ridiculous and stupid. Also it is very CGI heavy, the facehuggers were both fake and over used and the CGI flames and explosions were poor. The reason I am not giving this a 0/10 is because if after all that, if you switch your brain off it can be, to a certain extent, quite entertaining. But not if your a hardcore fan on the original two franchises.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
771,slaptastical,A fall from grace for the Alien and Predator Franchises,1,16 May 2008,"Mild spoiler Alert!Well, I say spoiler alert but it would be hard to spoil this film more than it has already spoiled itself. I read review somewhere, and the reviewer said they have a life and don't normally spend their spare time ripping up films just because they have nothing better to do with their time. I am the same, but after seeing this movie I felt it was my duty to write my first review on IMDb and warn people of what they are in for if they choose to go through with a viewing. For me, AVP-R feels like nothing more than a straight to video generic teen slasher film at best. It is a horrible film that doesn't work on any level and is making a mock of the classic films that it descends from. Just for the record, I am an easy person to please when it normally comes to this type of movie, aside from the original Predator/Alien/Aliens films, I also enjoyed Predator 2, Alien Resurrection and even the first AVP, so to say this film is bad is really making a statement. So where to start? Well, as a horror film it fails because simply, there is no horror. In the first few seconds of film you see both the alien and predator creatures, so immediately dispelling any sense of terror derived from not knowing what your dealing with, an attribute done so well in the first Alien and Predator. You could say that the audience already know what to expect from this film which is a fair comment, however what proceeds is a mindless hour and a half of beasties going around killing random characters we don't know and don't care to know, with pacing so fast there isn't a chance to create any suspense from any situation. This leads us to the next problem of the characters. Most of them appear to be out of the aforementioned low budget slasher flick, they are 2 dimensional with zero characterisation, clichéd to the max and given such inane dialogue as 'oh my god', 'god help us all', 'you're gonna make it', and 'we're not gonna make it', so the viewer is left not caring whether they do make it or not. The story is almost non-existent and at best is script writing by numbers. I could spoil the film for you by telling you what happens except for the problem that basically, nothing really does happen. Well, at least it might work as a no-brainer action flick, a bit like the first AVP? Try again. Having almost the entire setting take place at night, after the aliens conveniently take out a power station, the whole film is set in complete darkness. Maybe the film makers thought this would increase tension, but it achieves little more than being very annoying. You can literally see nothing most the time, so what action and violence is apparent in the film is wasted from the simple lack of visibility. Coupled with the very bad directing it makes for a very unsatisfying movie experience altogether. This really is a fall from grace for the Alien and Predator films. Avoid unless you really want to see how shocking it actually is.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
772,Kevken93,Who was that character again??,3,16 November 2018,This film is a MESS AN ABSOLUTE MESS. The story is all over the place and the characters might aswel just have bags over their heads thats how interesting they are. After seeing the very average AvP i was very sceptical about this film being anything other than 90mins of nothing but badly cut action scenes and awful dialogue between a few pretty uninteresting characters who are nothing but cannon fodder so that the main character or 2 live. In this film however after being over an hour in I still was unsure as to who we were supposed to be routing for. Just as you think ah so thats one of the main characters they get their heads cut off and your left thinking i wonder if that guy whatever his name is has been killed or not. God its bad.Moving on to the action scenes they are sub par. If you are expecting the scary tense scenes from Alien or the action packed scenes where the Predator picks off the characters 1 by 1 forget it. Instead what your left with is a bunch of xenomorphs running around in plain view being killed by a Predator acting more like a police officer with a few stupid humans getting themselves killed.If you are a fan of both series but arnt sure if you want to see this then just leave it.

773,elbarto-1,shame on you FOX - how much farther can these creatures fall?,4,27 December 2007,"how can they get some things so right and other things so wrong? sadly - this movie was a turd. at least i was prepared for it this time! the plot, the actors, the setting, the dialog - all turd. the only human characters i didn't openly lol at (seriously) was the ""general"" and the *spoiler* yutani character at the end. everyone else just wore on my nerves until i was praying for their deaths (especially the blonde whore and the bully douche) moving on - the predator - awesome - best predator portrayal/look since P1. ian whyte did a great job! too bad no one will give a damn. the aliens - looked good but were mostly just predator fodder and didn't get any real worthwhile scenes/screen time. it hurts when i see this great sci-fi creature reduced to chasing teens in a swimming pool and children in their back yards. ouch. if there ever is a ""phantom edit"" where we remove all the 'human' scenes you'd have a pretty decent 1/2 hr of AvP action. so, while the aliens and predators were treated 'well' and portrayed visually nicely - every other aspect of the film was utter rubbish. its too bad because the strauses seemed to genuinely care about and 'get' the creatures but forgot to add anything else remotely interesting. or would that be salerno's fault? at any rate, the movie's creatures looked good - better than AvP/A:R but the lack of ""good movie"" surrounding them makes this the weakest entry in the series. i'm sure that will change though once the inevitable AvP3 get shat out in the next few years. 4/10",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Everything was dark, and a black thing was moving over another black thing on a black background. I couldn't be scared of this movie cause there was nothing I could see to be scared of. Was that a PredAlien? A regular Alien? The Predator? A random bit of furniture? You never know... YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING!!! Yeah, the music didn't suck. MY GAWD the blonde girl ""jesse"" was hot.

775,VincentNero,Better than the first but still far from the originals,5,26 December 2007,"This movie delivered a half order. True, it is a tall order to fill for those who love the original Alien films and the first Predator, so a half order is a minor success being that it's done a better job at echoing the origins of the franchises in tone and action.The story is simple: A Predator ship crash lands on a small American town letting loose face suckers and the PredAlien.The PredAlien is essentially an Alien with a bigger brain or a Predator without the gadgets. He/She/It was a real lackluster character. It should have been able to top The Queen Alien from Aliens, but really, who could top James Cameron's work. Instead, the PredAlien simply was just another creature that goes bump in the night.The human characters were even worse. Being that the Aliens and the Predator are such great stock characters, the human characters need to be more developed with depth and dimension in emotion and story. AVP:R gave a noble attempted at first, but by having too many characters to care about and none to truly hate, all were short changed on character development. Will we never have another Ripley? Let's face it, this franchise is doomed so long as untalented storytellers who place style over substance hold the reigns of this sci-fi action vehicle. We can only hope that another talented and established director takes over. Maybe give David Fincher another shot so he can finally make the alien movie that he envisions rather than the sad sack Alien 3 that he disowns due to loss of creative control. Or better yet, I'd love to see what JJ Abrams could do.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
776,headneophyte,Piece of trash,2,31 January 2008,"This was the worst movie I have seen in a while. The acting was not that great. The story was bad. The entire franchise is in the toilet as far as I am concerned. The gore is WAY over the top. The originals (Alien & Aliens) were gory too but in a more frightening way. This was gore for gore's sake. My biggest issue with the movie was the *SPOILER* baby killing. At what point did showing THAT become necessary. Now before people go screaming I'm sensitive, I have no issues with death or anything like that. It happened in ""The Omen"" and was sad and furthered the plot and viewpoint. It could have been established in this movie that babies are a better food source and moved on with the initial pregnant lady being killed. That I had no problem with. If an alien race did invade as sick as it is, that would be the best food source if preying on humans. Happens all the time in nature, the alligator gets the baby monkey, zebra, etc. BUT they revisit this idea over and over, getting WAY more graphic than necessary. I mean, having the alien NOT spare the pregnant lady was in a way breaking that movie tradition, where the pregnant lady gets her belly sniffed by the killing machine and then left alone. I didn't mind her dying to drive home the point that aliens are ""pure evil"". But to have an Alien then shown hovering over a maternity ward baby room like its a buffet, THEN go visit the expecting mothers one by one was just too much and became stupid. At that point, I actually quit caring and just rode it out til the end. Terrible waste of time. Dragon Wars is actually better. D-War actually held the ""worst movie I have seen this year"" award until this came along. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! Vote with your wallet people!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

In fact, anyone who knows me would agree these two film / pop culture creations are personal icons. However, being great individual antagonist doesn't guarantee a good move when you mix the two. I just got back from watching Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem. Spoiler: This movie licks the underside of Gary Busey's sweaty nut sack. I may go into detail later but for now, I'll leave you with a fair warning. If you ARE looking for a waste of time, 90 minutes of high school dialogue, great action scenes and more cheese then a ""I love the 80s VH1 special"" then this IS the movie for you. If you're expecting anything remotely resembling the original Predator, Alien or Aliens then watch ASAP.

779,supamanz_04,Finally something for the fans,10,25 December 2007,"I'm not going to start this by bashing Paul Anderson, but let's face it AvP was a very weak movie and not worthy of the franchise. Now when i found out in January of this year that a sequel was being made I wasn't very enthusiastic. by august however, i was chomping at the bit to see this Rated R film. That's right, call me what you will but the R rating sealed the deal for me. I believe in staying true to the foundations of any franchise ""Aliens"" and ""Predators"" are no exceptions. Let me tell you this movie delivers on a level you will not believe. In space no one can hear you scream, on earth there is No mercy. From start to finish this film will have you on edge with glee. It fulfills everything that a true fan would ever wanna see and leaves you with questions answered and some more to ask. The only thing the writers of this film did wrong *THIS CAN BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER*(which they actually did right) was they stuck with Anderson's original plot hole and that is the quick gestation and molting of the aliens.other than that the film is flawless. there is very little to interpret. much like the other films, the predator is here to do a job, the aliens are multiplying like they always do. the humans, well they get caught up in the middle. I went in with a little disappointment, thinking that the trailers gave away most of the movie, but to my surprise there was so much more to this movie than portrayed in the trailers. so if you're a fan of either franchise and wanna see some hardcore action that leaves no room for pansies, AVPR is your movie. this will easily go down as one of the best action sci-fi movies ever",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

782,huckleboogie,what a disappointment,1,2 January 2008,".....contains spoilers!!!!......OK, this is the worst movie in the Alien saga yet, although I'm afraid there'll be worse in the future. in fact, being a huge Aliens fan, to me the whole Alien vs Predator thinge is a shame.i kinda could go along with AvP I, but as far as stupid dialogs and lines , and obvious flaws in the plot, this one here rules. and even people describing it as ""bad ass action/ horror""....what are You talking about?? this is one of the most boring, and least scary movies i ever seen. if You compare the first Alien movie to AvP II, You got the proof that the formula ""less is more"" works. i mean for people who totally don't care about the story-writing of a movie and just want some video-game-like action (nothing wrong with that, i like it too every now and then), it could be an alright movie...i'm just disappointed cos the original Alien AND Predator movies were more smart than that...and hey, if You got no better ideas than to end the plot with dropping of a bomb,sorry, thats not exactly top of the line story writing, hehe. i didn't think it could get worse than the Alien/Human hybrid in alien IV but voilà: they managed to top it off in this movie...i guess all of us who are into the original movies will go and give this movie a try, i just wanna say that i was Major disappointed by a poor story, over-the-top killings (so many that You just stopped caring about them) and poor references to other alien movies (""are the monsters dead now, mummy?"" - GIMME A BREAK!!)",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
783,sellingsberg,Horrible Alien vs. Predator Movie Ever(for now),1,16 October 2014,Where do I start...Well let me just say what the Hell was this movie. I watched the first one and was entertain through all of it because it had moments where you saw the Alien or Predator and it lead up to the big meeting. But this was like here lets destroy the ship full of Predators that are hunters and that have millions of weapons there to kill the PreAlien. Then show a kid how to hunt. Distress call sent in to an awesome Predator then lets show more on humans. It seemed like this movie was centered on what humans would do and not the fighting between Alien and Predator. The Predator and Alien fighting it was like a little treat. I like how the first one was where you were laughing at the people because you know what was happening and when we got our fight we were like yeah I bet the Predator/Alien would win. In this the only thing I liked was the One Lone Predator that killed everyone. I loved how he was just destroying everything in his path and tackled every obstacle. I hate this movie. It's that movie you watch on a boring day to yell at and complain about.,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
784,brittson,The Underrated sequel to the Underrated AVP series,6,20 February 2014,"When I first saw this on IMDb with a rating of 4.7, I thought this movie was going to suck. Looking at the trailer, especially when compared to the first AVP trailer, didn't make me feel any better. But, after watching this, it's not bad; in fact, it's better than the original AVP film. In the original film, they just threw a bunch of people together, added some exposition for character development and background, and just killed them off. The only survivor in that film was, ironically enough, the only person we felt for through the whole thing. The rest of the expedition? Screw them. But in Requiem, they at least built up to the action, at least they gave some background and development to the characters. You can honestly root for the brothers and soldier mother in the film because you do honestly feel for them. The people in the film also feel more real, if that makes sense. You honestly think this is how original people would act and think when thrown into such a situation. In this sequel, I feel you getting the best from both the Alien and Predator worlds: the thrill of the hunt from Predator and the terror of the unknown from Alien. There are some genuine scary scenes in this film that callback the terror of the original Alien film. The plot is somewhat predicable and some characters exist to simply die in the next scene after they are introduced (honestly, why else were those stoners doing in this film for), but all in all, watch this film.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

It won't win any Oscars but hey ho it had a hard ass predator kicking the ass of many aliens, humans and the predalien - what more do you want? After seeing the film and reading all the negative reviews I watched (for the 50th time) the first two Alien films and Predator and I can honestly say that if you liked them you will like the new AVP 2 film. I'd looked forward to it since I heard it was coming out as I love all the other films. While it wasn't up there with your blockbusters like Shawshank redemption, or many other great films it did what it says on the tin, as they say in the advert. Some people just love to hate hyped up films but I would say go and see it and make your own mind up. I loved it and many people I have spoken to also found it a great addition to the aliens and predator franchise. I can't wait till the next one comes out. Just watch the bit where the predator rips the heads off two aliens with those Gillette boomerangs that look like they came straight out off the Krull movie in the 80's.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
787,hoyasooner,"Turn off your brain, here comes a sequel",10,25 December 2007,"Let me forewarn readers right now. Aliens versus Predator 2 is a piece of junk, though a watchable piece of junk. If you are able to successfully turn off your brain for an hour and a half, you may enjoy it. If your brain is unwilling to take a brief nap, however, you're better off watching another movie.So what are the problems with the movie? Script, pacing, and internal consistency. We don't have any of them here. Upon watching the film, my first thought was ""I bet the director got his start doing music videos."" Called it like a champ.The script is weak, to say the least. It's a ""Google Search"" script. In other words, I'm betting my money that they found the script by doing a Google Search for ""AvP sequel script"" and snagging the first bit of fanfiction they came across. The movie plays like it was written by a 15 year old. It's not a spoiler to say that there are Aliens running around town, and a Predator is hunting them. You get that from the name of the film. That's about as far as the writers got, too. The rest of the movie is a mish-mash of subplots you've seen before, in other, better movies. Pretty girl with jealous ex? Check. Heroic bad boy with a dark past? Check. Protective mother with small child? Check. Unfortunately, the subplots are so incredibly cliché that you see them coming before they actually take place. ""Ah, there will be a pretty girl, and her jerk boyfriend will hate this character who is currently on screen."" Called it like a champ.The pacing of the movie is far too quick. It's an hour and a half film, and while you're never bored, you're also never in suspense. Less than 2 minutes into the movie, there are already several deaths and we've already seen the appearance of the chief bad guy. Like a teenager on a ""sure-thing"" date, this movie skips over any pretense of foreplay and moves straight on to the main event. Ten minutes into the movie, we've already got a decent body count and a horde of extra terrestrials stomping around our quiet mountain town. Note that by the ten minute mark in the original Alien, the crew is receiving a distress call from an unknown source, and around the same point in the original Predator, Arnold and company are jumping out of a helicopter into a lush South American jungle. There's rarely a moment without action in this movie, which is a problem, as that leaves almost no time for background, character development, explanations, plot developments, etc. Characters who look like they should be sympathetic (a young boy and his father, a pregnant mother looking for her husband, etc) are not on screen long enough for us to develop any form of attachment to them, and in many cases, not even long enough to learn their names, before they meet a grisly end. We learn only that we might have liked this person (who would certainly be more interesting than the stock cardboard characters we're given as ""main characters"" in this film), had the director spent any more time on them. The actual story itself seems as though it should take at least a few weeks to take place, yet it all happens within two days. The entire movie is rushed.Finally, we have internal consistency issues. There are at least 30 times in the 90 minute movie that your brain will say ""hey, wait a minute, that doesn't make sense..."" That's about once every three minutes. The movie supposedly takes place in a small Colorado town, yet aerial views sometimes show a massive city. A character mentions that the local power plant has a damaged reactor, yet the power plant is clearly not a nuclear facility. Remember the big apocalyptic explosion at the end of the first Predator movie? Another takes place at the very beginning, within a few miles of the town, and yet no one notices a thing (nor do they notice the giant alien spaceship crashing into the surrounding countryside). Characters do inexplicable things for no apparent reason, and no explanation is ever given. Much is made of the caustic alien blood that can eat through steel (or flesh and bone). I can buy the concept that the Predator would have special weapons that would not be affected by this blood, allowing him to stab them with a spear and not pull back a burned stub. I can't buy the scene that shows alien blood spewing all over his skin and having no effect (presumably because the filmmakers forgot that alien blood was made of acid).I can say good things about the film. The acting was decent for a movie this far down the sequel chain. Most of the action scenes were very nice. Some movies have action scenes that cut back and forth so quickly you can't follow them -- this did not have that problem. The visual effects looked very good, the CGI was well done and the monsters looked great (much better than ""I Am Legend""). There are lots of pretty people doing exciting things, and the action never drags down to the point where you are bored. It'll entertain the junior high and high school crowd without a doubt.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
788,manwhosoldtheworld-1,Too Little Too Late.,1,7 May 2008,"I, as many of us have been, captivated by the Alien and Predator series since their inception in the 1980s. The first sequel to both movies delivered the same feelings and unique story telling that was awesome prevalent in the first Predator and Alien movies. Respectively the subsequent sequels there after were lacking but still tried to retain the story telling (namely the Alien movies as Predator never moved beyond 2). In the 1990s I came upon the Alien VS Predator comic series and was blown away at the imaginative story telling and the placing of actual background and feeling behind each race. The comics were able to bring it up from the monster movie status that the characters had been pigeonholed with and create an entire world where you got to actual enjoy the characters. This leads us to the first AVP movie, which by any standards is a complete disaster of un-imaginative story telling from the master of bland plots Paul W.S. Anderson (Props for Event Horizon respectively). I'll spare you critique on the first film although I will say I was incredibly let down by the lack of any actual feeling or story telling used and was appalled to just see a rehashed out movie monster film (namely the end scene with the predator battling the queen alien is possibly the most poorly thought out thing I have ever witnessed IE the main characters role.) This film is no exception from the insane amount un-imaginative story telling that plagues modern cinema. IT is entirely a re hash of the previous films and offers absolutely no creativity or insight at all. The most interesting thing in the entire film is the brief view of the Predator home world and the breathtaking hope that they would expand on something so greatly detailed in the comic series. Yet from the there the film makers decided to entirely rely on weak plot devices and cliché characters to tell a insanely meager tale. The film essentialy revolves around the idea of Aliens infesting a town in the middle of wilderness and how that would play out. One of the big problems being that this film is NOT AN ALIEN OR PREDATOR FILM!!! It is just playing on the movie monster device and adding absolutely no creativity in film making what so ever. I would have loved to heard their pitch to whoever distributed/funded the film, ""Ok so its a lot like the other movies! Its got action and key characters and drama and in fact it IS the other movies!!! We didn't even write new lines for the characters they just say all the lines from the old movies!!"" Literally numerous shots are used from their previous films and used in extreme distaste! They even stoop as low as re-using the very famous ""Get to the chopper"" line from the first predator. If on the inception of that line you don't feel like vomiting all over your TV then don't worry because the film will almost have reached its anti-climatic climax and thankfully end.In short; Do not pay more than a dollar to see this movie and do not at all expect to be actually watching a Alien, Predator, or even AVP movie at all. This film is just a corny B-movie with Aliens and Predators licensed into it. Probably the worst mistake was that the filmmakers didn't have a critic screening of it to find out how terrible the film they just wasted money on was. Hopefully the future will hold a actual writers turn on the AVP story and some actual creativity will be used and not just a corny re-hash that blew so hard it dropped off the earth and straight onto video store shelves within a month of its theatrical release.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
789,hiko_seijuro,Back to the roots Vs. rip-off,6,28 January 2008,"When I saw this movie Saturday, I was at first strikken by the plot, which is not really thick. I vaguely continues where the previous AVP left off. So, as was to be expected, the hideous cross-breeding creature comes to earth and causes terror in a quiet little town.But I could deal with that. We got a glimpse of what is supposed to be the predator home planet, we get a badass predator who comes wants to intervene and the weaponry he brings is literally something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue! Now that I liked! Also the creators tried to go back to the roots with the jungle-bamboo theme for the predator and his nasty habits when being under attack (for fans, you know what I mean).The film doesn't spare its characters either, which can be considered good or bad. I found one death rather sad, but the rest was collateral damage and therefore was affordable. The whole teenage romance / rivalry, I personally could do without, but each his own.Only the last ten minutes made me change my mind about the rating. I thought it was enjoyable for a night of action entertainment, but the ending is such a pure rip-off from Resident Evil : Apocalypse and that deja-vu feeling made me give it a 6, which you might consider rather generous, but what can I say? I love the characters... If you do too, you might consider seeing it anyway, for old times sake.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
790,llllllll,You know what you are getting into.,10,26 December 2007,"OK, first things first. If you are an Alien or Predator fan you are seeing this movie regardless if you read the user comments or not. Now that that is out of the way, time for my thoughts. This film is a step in the right direction as to how these movies should be made. Wasn't perfect but it did its job. There are a lot of little nit-picky things I can complain about because I am a hardcore fan but that won't help anyone who is actually reading these comments to decide if they want to go see it.Pros: The movie is fast paced. It is rated R so there is more blood, guts, and gore. Similar music makes you feel very nostalgic. There a bunch of ""in suit"" creature effects, which if you have seen the crappy CGI of say "" I Am Legend"" you will understand how it makes a movie better if you actually know that there is something real on the screen. New Predator tools and gadgets. Better Alien designs. Good action and surprisingly the acting wasn't all that bad. Bonus points for throwing in an Arnold line from the first Predator movie, trust me, it's not the one you think.Cons: Too short. Actually could have been more violent. Everyone has been saying how this movie would be a ""hard R"" but it could have been more violent without going over the top. The Alien was still giving off that ""incect"" feel.Overall: Any fan of either Alien or Predator will enjoy this movie better than the first attempt. Any sci-fi/action/horror fan should give this film a chance because it is a breath of fresh air with all these so called ""PG-13"" horror films that are just cranked out today.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
791,bill-gervasi,Terrible and boring,2,28 December 2007,"AVP2 was one of the worst movies I have seen in years, and a terrible disappointment after the surprisingly decent AVP1 which at least had characters you cared about and a cool ending. AVP2 suffers from bad lighting, inconsistencies with previous movies in the series (note how much shorter the incubation period has become), and missed numerous opportunities to inject some empathy for the main characters.Particularly senseless was an attempt at a romantic triangle with caricatures of a rude country bumpkin, add one hot chick who manages to get mostly naked for some obscure reason, then toss in a recovering loser. It is never clear why we are supposed to like any of the three nor care which ones survive.The gore level is ratcheted up but still falls short of the best movie of the series, Aliens, which employed sympathy with the gore. Who couldn't be moved by Newt in a cocoon? Don't look for any such tender moments here. The best the director could come up with was going after children, born and unborn, with whom you had no more than 15 seconds of character development prior to their demise.Let's pray that Dan O'Bannon doesn't get a wild hair to ruin his classic Dark Star with a sequel this bad.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
792,diegohernandez,A Decent Sequel,6,14 January 2008,"I have not seen ""Alien vs. Predator"" yet (low on my priority list), so I cannot comment on whether ""Aliens vs. Predator Requiem"" is an improvement over it's predecessor or not. However, after having seen ""Alien"", ""Aliens"", ""Predator"", and ""Predator 2"", I do know what an ideal film adaptation should contain. Thankfully, AVPR takes some impressive strides towards realizing this vision.The plot of AVPR is simple, but sufficient: a Yautja (Predator) manned spacecraft is sabotaged by Xenomorphs (Aliens), and crashes into a lake in Gunnison, Colorado, USA. An expert Yautja assassin is then dispatched from the species' homeland to the site of the crash; once there, he is to eliminate all evidence of Yautja and Xenomorph existence, and to destroy the Xenomorphs themselves. Sounds easy enough for a gargantuan warrior, right? Wrong. Not only must the Yautja tangle with his dreaded enemies, but now he must also face an even deadlier foe: the Predalien, a hybrid of both Yautja and Xenomorph genes. While the hunt occurs, the residents of Gunnison do their best to survive the carnage of the war.Of course, anyone who goes to watch an Alien vs. Predator movie would expect to see some convincing battles between the two entities. On this, AVPR mostly succeeds. I found it very hard not to smile while watching the Yautja toss around the Xenomorphs, and while it blasted his foes with a shoulder cannon. These encounters are further supported by the excellent FX and CG, which grants the creatures their convincing looks. The Yautjas and Xenomorphs of AVPR also thankfully act the way they should: the Yautjas are portrayed as intelligent and honor-bound hunters while the Xenomorphs are shown to be savage and primal. The primary Yautja in particular is easily likable; he's ruthless, cunning, merciless, and remorseless, which makes his cold-blooded slaughter all the more fun.Two dark elements co-exist in AVPR, yet one is productive, whereas the other is bothersome. The former element is the darkness of the story. Although the plot may sound bare enough, it does not spare anyone in it's killing spree. The R rating of AVPR means that everyone of the small town of Gunnison are vulnerable to the war; no one is exempt from the violence. This commendable decision leads to some shocking, but memorable, moments in the film.This then leads us to the other dark element of AVPR, and the one that decreases the overall quality. Simply put, this film is shot way too darkly. It's great if one wants to create a monster movie shot in the dead of night and in dreary locations, but the audience should at least be able to see the creatures and what they're doing at the same time! Truthfully, the visibility of the space beings is sufficient, but it still remains a challenge to actually spot them in a number of sequences. The most damaging consequence of this is that there is not one clear, identifiable shot of the Predalien throughout the entire movie. All we mostly see is the structure of the beast, but barely any of the fine details.I also found fault with the human characters of AVPR. All of them are dull, and they hardly contribute anything worthwhile to the film. Also, the humans share most of their scenes with their own kind, while the Yautjas and Xenomorphs share their scenes between the two parties. The bizarre consequence of this is that it creates a dual perspective for the film: that is, when the creatures are shown, you'll be entertained, but when the humans are around, you'll be bored. The thought of, ""C'mon, get back to the monsters!"" is the common sentiment that applies here.I will concede though, that there are some amusing moments between the human characters. Other than that, they're only trite, cardboard creations who should have had a much smaller role in the film.AVPR stumbles in some areas, but it does a fine job of presenting the two hideous life forms beating the holy hell out of each other. In this kind of film that is the most important type of goal to achieve, and so AVPR ultimately manages to accomplish it's goals, flaws and mistakes notwithstanding.RATING: ***½/*****",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
793,classact68,Just plan BAD!,1,25 December 2007,"As for the first movie, it was OK, yes the end was a little out there. As for AVP-R was just plain BAD. Never got to see the Alien-Predator mix very well at all. One Predator, thats it. I was hoping to see a lot of each battling it out in a town where humans just got in the way. I was so disappointed after the movie. I would love to see just 50 Predators and 150 Aliens duke it out, with us getting in the way.Sorry, i think this movie is down right awful. I would wait for HBO or Starz, would not even waste the money on a retail. This was as bad as Blood Rayne 2.Go watch Aliens and the first two Predator movies, and you will be much happier.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
794,TomCatJones,I didn't think it could get worse than AVP...but it did.,1,5 May 2008,"This movie is terrible plain and simple. First off, it's too dark. I am not being a baby about that either, you have to adjust your TV brightness to almost the highest it will go. I tested it on 3 TV's, and they all had the same issue. Everything is shot in the dark, and its not ""the dark"" that you can still see in, its the dark that you can barley make out anything that moves in.Onto the movie itself. It was jumbled. There are about 10 different story lines that lead into one at the end. First you get every single episode of Dawson's Creek and teen drama all boiled into 15 min. YOu get the young boy who loves the pretty girl, but she has a douche bag boy friend that beats the crap out of him. You already know the boy friend is going to die. You also have the mom returning home from Iraq, who's daughter is distant to her now and she has some weird chemistry with the ""former bad boy"" who just got back into town too. (I am SORRY I don't remember their names...I just didn't care to pay attention that much. So Army Mom's husband gets killed by an Alien, she seemingly doesn't care and is not too heart broken as the movie goes on. I know that when you are running for your life, you tend to keep other things out of your mind. But there were a few slow downs where she didn't even acknowledge that her husband was torn apart by an Alien. Then you get the former bad boy who comes back to town, and you assume he was arrested and sent out of town to jail, but they never get into it, so you have a pretty boy who is trying to make sure his brother doesn't become like him. Wow, I believe I saw this movie 9 years ago when it was called ""Gone in 60 Seconds"".Let's talk about the Predator. In AVP part 1 (which was TERRIBLE, we see that the Predator species was helping humans out in the BC times, but also using them as sacrifices to spawn Aliens for a ""hunt into Predator manhood"". Anway, we see that everything from Predator 1 and 2 gets thrown out and in the end the girl and the Predator become BFF's and fight together. In this one, the Predator isn't helping anyone other than to try to hide the existence of the Aliens. Also there is only 1. There are about 50,000 Aliends running around, but the Predator species sends only 1 to take care of the problem. He kills a few humans, skins one like in the originals and then fights the big bad PredAlien only to have the double kill, since Hey! Can't have a clear cut winner since the series is only getting started.Now what about the ""PredAlien""? They replace the Queen with something that is 98% Alien with the Predator's mouth. Now there are some SOLID deaths this thing causes. Like how it puts a bunch of Aliens into the Pregnant woman. But it still is pretty stupid when you think about how the Predator species only sends 1 to kill this ""abomination"" when there are about 10 million of them. Anyway the final battle is pretty lame, they had to throw in ""Get to the chopper"", although it sounds REALLY bad when it is coming out of the mouth of the Governator. In a scene that is similar to Predator 1, the Predator takes off all his (or her, if they even have sexes) armor and weapons to fight hand to hand against the PredAlien. It ends with the spikes going through the PA's head and the tail going through the Predator...just like in the first AVP.They both don't die though right away, nope, that is left up to the Government who decides to nuke the town and kill everything including the people who survived. Now here is the BIG problem with this movie. The surviving 4 people (The bad boy, the younger bro, the army mom and the little kid) encounter the government. Who you assume let them live. Now when you kill a town and then go to the new head of the Wayland corp. is foreshadowing the ""Alien"" franchise by keeping the Predator's weapon under wraps, you would assume that the government would kill the 4 survivors to keep what happened quiet. But you never find that out....hell even Hostel 2 killed Paxton before he could tell about what happened in Hostel 1.Overall it is a bad movie with a BAD payoff. At least Freddy Vs. Jason was fun to watch.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

But, you will witness a total carnage watching the ""Unrated"" version, which has more footage.The story was a little expected and predictable. It's a Friday the 13th type slasher movie, but the Aliens play the 'Jason' part. I am not an avid follower of the series, but I do know that the Predator usually sticks to their agenda, and does not go out to hunt humans....however, a few are goners here.If you are a Sci-fi fan, it's a good movie to watch.Watch the Blu-Ray DVD version, and select the option to have an icon display on the screen when a ""Cut from theater version"" clip appears.

796,davidrwebster,Un film de Forrest Gump....,2,22 September 2010,"This is what I would expect to see splashed across the end of the closing credits. Except that no-one - not even Forrest Gump - would put their hand in the air and acknowledge such an extraordinarily poor movie. In due time, we will find out that this is actually the first screenplay written by a computer, possibly aided by chimpanzees.Whoever or whatever is responsible, they have no time for Sci-Fi or for the Alien or Predator movies. AvP was a pretty unpromising idea and giving it a contemporary setting showed it was essentially a piece of exploitation filmmaking. AVPR further disregarded the conventions of the original movies, added some teen-movie stereotypes, stirred in some genuinely tasteless gratuitous violence - but alas, by the end it didn't turn out that we were all dreaming.This isn't the worst movie ever made and I give it a 2, rather than 1, only because of some decent efforts by the actors. The cast were presumably aware that if they acted in line with the quality of the screenplay they may never work again.In a third movie I expect to see a radioactive mutant giant Predalien; the girls in the school swimming pool scene that was inexplicably cut from this movie; puppies and kittens used to incubate aliens; and a bold rescue by a Stargate SG4 team as the producers try to bolt in another Sci-Fi franchise.I apologise that this review does not contain spoilers - since some specific idea of what you are letting yourself in for is due. In this case, plot details would not constitute a spoiler - it could be regarded as fair warning. If you still decide to watch the movie and you are a Sci-Fi fan, you would be advised to regard it as a spoof.

When I watched Alien 3 and Alien 4, everything I could think of was just how much of a disgrace these movies are to the first two. But this movie is about ten times worse. There's no tension. Not a single bit. Just a few Xenomorphs and a weird Predalien thing killing some people in a city. Pretty gory killing at parts. But I just couldn't give a toss, because EVERY SINGLE ******* CHARAKTER is just expendable, uninteresting and flat beyond belief. For the unnerving entirety of this piece of garbage, I just sat there and prayed that this abomination of a movie is over soon. I wanted every single character to just die instantly. Just instantly. Without any reason whatsoever. So the movie could end. That would actually have made this move better. **** this movie. I hate it. I wish I had never seen this rotten mess of awful writing.

798,mdett1776,Not as good as you hoped but everything you'd expect,10,26 December 2007,"Having been a long time fan of both the Predator and the Alien franchise for many years, I eagerly anticipated the release of the first AVP movie back in 04. Although that movie was somewhat entertaining, I still felt as though it could have been much better. When I saw the previews for AVP2 I was also eager to see it and cautiously optimistic that it might help to make up for the failures of the first one. The verdict is...the same. The movie is enjoyable but only if you don't go to see it with any grandiose expectations. Yes the characters were two dimensional and the script cliché ridden but then you shouldn't go to this movie looking to see fine acting or hear moving words. You go to this movie looking to see Predators and Aliens kicking the crap out of each other. And in that respect you won't be too disappointed. All in all, go to see this movie if you like the franchise and you probably won't be disappointed. Otherwise, wait for the DVD release.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

The action sequences were dull, and even the predator bored me. One of the worst movies I've had the displeasure of seeing. If I were to torture someone, I would force them to watch this film until they've memorized every line. That said, I must give credit where it's due. Many of the effects are good. The PredAlien looks amazing, as does the Predator. However, as anyone who has seen the Transformers movies will tell you, effects don't make a good movie. Story and characters do, and this movie doesn't have that. If I were to watch it, I'd mute it and substitute my own dialogue.

The camera angles and the lighting were so bad I couldn't tell if I was watchin a pred or an alien. And what was with the stupid sheriff ditchin the survivor crew who were in a tank to run his pink ass to the center of town with the rest of those idiots. Wut about our fa great national guard who showed up for 30 seconds and all got killed, and even worse not one drop of blood.

802,love_cats_hate_dogs,One of the worst films I have ever seen,2,15 March 2008,"I had heard bad things about this film before watching it, and so, grudgingly I decided to go ahead, because MAYBE they'd rescued it from the mediocrity that was AvP - but in no way was I prepared for what would unfold before my eyes in the following, rather scant, 90 minutes.The film opens to some blurred, awful CGI spaceship that could have been done better with a model on a stick, where the first film left off (that was the best part of AvP: The ending credits) and from this relative zenith (0:00 running time), the film steadily gets worse. The only thing that made the scenes at the beginning of the film any good were the on-screen predator presence, but even that turned out to be disappointing because the Predators did not have that same ""attitude"" they had in P1 & P2. Then one of the Predators makes possibly the most stupid decision in history, and the Predator ship crashes to earth.Cue stereotypical American ""Dad"" and his annoying son hunting in the forest. They see the ship hurtling meteor-like to its doom and investigate (which isn't really that far-fetched, but of course it crashes in the US, the only place in the Hollywood world where things happen), though ""Generic Dad"" and his son must have had one of those land-speeders from Star Wars because they cover what must be 10 miles of forest in a ridiculously short time. Then what happens? Oh my god I can't believe it! Exactly what everyone was expecting to happen happened. You even know what happened just reading this, so I shall leave it as to let you share my eye-rolling and disappointment when you witness that scene for yourself. Cue some more awful CGI and we move on to some ""story"".Gunnison, the town in which the story takes place is full of stereotypical teen-drama characters, and apparently every time someone in Gunnison speaks, ""generic touching music"" plays. Oh, I can feel myself welling up right now. A bunch of unknown actors then proceed to waste your time talking about things YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT and you will find yourself, like me, screaming out loud ""what does any of this have to do with AvP? Where's the Predators and the Aliens?"" I was almost convinced they'd put the wrong reel on and I was watching some bittersweet family-flick that was meant to be running next door.Then we are further tortured by some Dawson's Creek-esquire story of the nerdy kid who wants the girl but she's already got a boyfriend who is an unlikeable jock. Once again I found myself screaming ""Get on with AvP!!!!"", I mean why had I paid money to see this and yet find myself being slowly tortured? had I angered some deity? Finally we get ""moving"", if I could call it that because of the painfully slow pace of the first half, and here is the rest of the film which contains cringe-inducing aliens-on-casters, predators with some serious decision-making issues, scenes that are so fake and contrived you will want to storm out of the cinema, and yet more awful CGI. Not to mention that every fight scene seems to be filmed with the camera about an inch from the combatant's faces so you can't see what's going on, and even if they panned out a bit, it would still be too dark too see anything anyway. Maybe the creature effects were just that bad.Then we are treated to what seems like a series of ideas directly lifted from the previous films, done awfully. Here we see just how Predator and Alien etc. would have turned out if they had been done by third-rate directors who didn't really care. The directors seem to try to pull every ""shock"" trick out of the bag to make you give a damn about this awful film, which, if you are like me, you forced yourself to sit through just because it had predators and aliens in it, or because maybe there might be one good scene you could remember to block out all the complete rubbish, but on this they absolutely fail. The end, where the big fight always takes place, brings the film back a little but by the end you probably won't even care.Do not pay to see this tacky, forced, clichéd, soulless, shrivelled turd of a film because if you have experienced the greatness that is Predator, Alien, and Aliens you will leave sorely disappointed.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
803,ryanpbaskett,An alien for every person... somehow...,4,30 April 2017,"!SPOILERS!Literally 90% of this movie is individual scenes of individual people randomly getting killed by an alien. From the start of the movie there goes from being like two aliens to suddenly an alien for every person literally everywhere. Everything happens so fast and now everyone even in their houses is in the presence of an alien somehow. Everyone's running scared and the city is in a state of chaos but nobody even has any idea that the aliens are causing all this because every time anyone sees one they die. This movie is riddled with plot holes beyond imagination. Pros: Reiko Aylesworth is really really hot! Cons: literally everything else. The whole small town feel specifically is just irritating and I can't stand it when they make than an element of a movie. ""Oh hey, we had sex regularly when we were like 4, and my bf is randomly the dumbest douche bag bully I could find. I know, I'll break up with him and get back with you this time for keeps, just like old times."" All of the second hand characters are all wiped out in all of the run for your lives scenes conveniently and then all of the main characters meet at the gun store. The hot army chick's husband, the friends groups' two non-essential friends, a bunch of the dumbest national guard that apparently are never looking in the right direction at the right time, it's all just irritatingly predictable.I only got this movie because I'll take all of the Reiko Aylesworth footage I can get.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

While you could wait until this terrible film hits the stores, or torrent; this film is so bad it's hilarious. John Ortiz as Officer ""Morales"", has to be the worst character and actor I've seen in a long time. This film is utter crap. I laughed during the entire motion picture, even at scenes that weren't even meant to be funny.However, on the bright side the film is slightly better than the first aliens vs predator. It is also somewhat beneficial that the film is rated r, but the film makers choose not to really truly use the option.

809,fornkyl,rent it don't watch it,10,26 December 2007,Well if you like blood and gore with no plot and terrible acting this movie is for you. I've been a fan of the franchises of both predator and alien for quite sometime. I think the movies for AVP can't work because it is too hard to write a descent script to include both of these franchises. The movie seemed too cheesy and lame. It starts off from where the last one ended and jumps right into the action with all the predators on the ship getting murked and the plane crashes in Colorado. The back at planet predator one gets the message of what has happened and rushes to earth to take out all the aliens and cover the predator's tracks from ever being there. The actors in the movie and average at best and most of them are terrible with cheesy lines and dumb facial expressions. I think everyone that died I laughed at as with the rest of the theatre because your really didn't care about the characters and wanted them to die anyway. I was actually disappointed in the fight scenes as well they were about 20 seconds long including the last one with the pred-alien I think this is what I was most disappointed about.

It has become an action movie, I think it is a good popcorn movie, with a lot of twist that I did not see coming. It is not a very good directed movie (like Die Hard 4.0), but the second half of the movie makes it all good. The role of the Predator could have been a bit more clarified, and that of the Alien too. They show up and do their thing, but I did not really connect with the beasts. Nice final, but the end was a bit confusing. You really should see for yourself if you like or don't like it.

The Alien is no longer scary. Gone is the elegance. Gone is the menace and chilling patience. Made by people who know how to make FX but have no real idea about how to make a movie. I sometimes wondered if they were making fun of what had gone before, like a Zucker/Abrams flick as it seemed to veer into what could be construed as parody. Sadly, no.Remember when you were a kid, playing with, oh let's see, some Star Wars figures? It would be some adventure not from the films but just your own kiddie imagination recreating certain feelings of excitement. And even if Han and Luke were stranded on some carpet planet, they might wind up saying some familiar lines, like ""I have a bad feeling about this,"" or find themselves in a situation more than a bit like one from the films. Just your kid imagination putting together a story that pleases your own juvenile sense of what you feel it should be. And that's fine, because you're a kid and really shouldn't know any better. What's more, you're not getting paid to do it either.Brother's Strause, go and buy some toys and never go near a film camera again.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

This was a cheap horror type film that should not of made the big screen. No one wants to see pregnant women and babies being killed and eaten. Like I said, no class.

Instead of building any sort of tension or suspense, they go instead for pure shock value.There was also little to no character development at all.

Going into this movie, I already had low expectations. To sum it all up, this movie exceeded my expectations and brought a new low. The whole thing lacked any substance. I sat there and ridiculed it the whole time with my brother while most of the audience made snide remarks about the poor acting and script. I left 5 minutes before the movie even ended, so maybe the movie rebounded the last couple minutes... who knows. The cgi and special effects were pretty cool, if you are going to just get a taste of aliens and predators then by all means, just look at it like its a show, like comic-con or something. Looks like they are simply demo-ing some new props, just ignore everything else,then maybe it will spark some interest. Initially I felt bad at the curt comments about the directors and actors, but when I saw the movie,I'd have to agree with most of them.

I've read comments by other users here that flame the film, when their own comments are filled with a blatant lack of general knowledge and ability to think on your own - So I'll try to elaborate on why I think the film was excellent, and why I say such things about other reviews.AvP:R in itself is clearly a film made by people that *loved* Aliens, and Predator. Paying constant homage to our favorite scenes from both films I found myself very often thinking ""Oh man, thats just like Aliens"" or ""Hah! Get to the chopper!"". I was glad to see a new strong female protagonist (the US Army solider.. I have no idea where the other reviewer got the idea it was a Marine) and despite how I found myself thinking ""woah.. NVGs? thats a pretty spendy and hard to explain why you lost kind of item"" Its nothing that is unheard of in real life. Sure there were a few characters that were poorly written and even more poorly acted, but thankfully they were killed quickly and brutally.I have heard it stated before that people have found so called plot holes in the film, but with the exception of a very very few they all seem to be less of plot holes and more of situations that just require you to use a little brain power and think about it rather then have it spelled out in big bold letters for you by the director.Honestly I enjoyed AvP:R and think that Alien 3 would have been a much, much better film if they had followed a formula much closer to this film, then have thrown David Fincher into the mix with no script and a preset release date.The director of this film managed to salvage the AvP franchise from the certain death that Paul Anderson had doomed it to.More please!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Finally some real Huntin',9,4 February 2008,"Ever since i was a kid a have been a HUGE fan of both franchises, and like everyone else like me when the first AVP came out i was Shocked, mostly by how FOX managed to ruin 2 of my favorite franchises in one crappy movie. it was a short, written full of holes and with a PG-13 rating it was but but a poor shadow of both original concepts.That was my first thought when i heard about AVP2 but guess what... Although this film has got all the markings of another teen horror flick (a hunky cop dude, a slutty blond teen, a bully-beaten boyfriend etc..), and no Real HERO character, what it does have is a fairly Cool setting for the PRED to do what he does Best. Starting out exactly when the First AVP left of (like i knew he would) this movie follows the account of The PREDALIEns crash in the ship after killing all the hunters on board, of course the Hunters wont miss such an opportunity for Sport and a new hunter flys in to ""Clean up"" the mess... in other words the PRED is finally back in business after the poor performance by the relatively Sissy hunters in AVP who managed to get killed from the start. This movie is well paced and is Very ""R"" rated (theres even a skinned corpse and much more:) though it seems that like in many series the producers pour more ketchup on walls instead of cinematic sophistication. technically i think the action could have been smoothed out a bit without resorting to RapVideo style filming and editing but it is still mosly inYOface hack & slash, with NEW PRED weapons and A PREDALIEn hybrid got me clappin my hands from joy a number of times...

I'll just list all the horrible events in no particular order. 1.)Father and son both get attacked by baby alien hand things. The dad gets his arm melted in half by the alien's acid blood, then the dad and his kid both have baby aliens burst out of their chests later. 2.) An entire hospital becomes a colony for aliens. The entire hospital is filled with horribly mangled and mutilated dead people for no reason. (Why couldn't they colonize a prison or something?) 3.) An alien appears where all the crying babies are. The music and editing implies that the alien killed all of the infants. 4.) A pregnant woman has Several baby aliens implanted orally into her. Later on, she, and her kid die when the baby aliens burst out of her bloody womb. (seriously, the filmmakers REALLY hate kids) 5.) A little girl is subject to tons of people being brutally mutilated, including her dad. 6.) A nuke wipes out the whole town. (no, there aren't any plot devices trying to explain how the government could cover it up, the movie just ends) All this movie is is an average horror movie with high production values: the gore is top-notch. This was even worse than the first avp movie. I am a fan of the Alien and Predator movies, but this movie wasn't just disappointing, like the first avp, it was simply horrible. Also, if you saw the first AVP, then you know it was disappointing because there were very few scenes of actual aliens versus predators. That was a problem the filmmakers failed to fix in the sequel too. the movie is more like ""Humans vs. Aliens and a Predator"" 'Whoever wins, you lose (because you paid ten bucks to see it)'.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
825,JOE_Canadian888,Please remove this movie from the theatre,1,25 December 2007,"This movie just made it on time, i mean....come on, it just catch up with one of the worst movie that played on this year.I don't know if it's the movie theatre or my eye, the movie scenes looks like it record with a 70's recorder. It's real dark in most of the scenes i can't even tell which is which. ( i swear if this movie not made with HD-DVD or Blu Ray disk, you can't see which one is the alien or predator. Story just plain garbage, really, if you replace the aliens and predator and put in zombie, it might be worth watching) Fight scenes is just.....i can't find a word to describe it, just some dark object moving around and bam !! 5 sec later we just switch to another scenes without knowing what happen.Story......just like a 5 years old kid trying to finish his book report on the next morning. No plot, no stand out character. (come on, when you drop your car key in the sewer, you don't need to walk like 5 miles away from where it drop to pick it back up) The boss fight.....please........I hope they can find someone else to do the next one, i don't have high hope when i was planning to watch this movie but i wouldn't even go watch it again even if i get pay.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
826,chasandnina,Mistake watching this movie before reviewing it,1,28 December 2007,"I made a mistake watching this movie before reviewing it, and I paid the price and wasted my time on trash.Aliens VS Predator sounds like a fighting match between aliens and predators doesn't it? The creators of this movies were careful to state aliens as plural and predator as singular. I expected a fighting match-up between aliens and predators, but watched one predator fight against maybe 20 aliens and win.I thought the movie was trash because the aliens ate every man, woman and child including pregnant women that came in contact with them. At least the predator only fought against aliens and people who carried weapons.Now what is trash to me maybe treasure to someone else. I expected to see a fight but saw a lot more trash than fighting. I sure made a mistake watching this garbage before looking at the reviews. My New Year's resolution is never watch a movie before reviewing it, because I never want to pay for trash and look at trash again.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
827,mrjae-1,a better attempt but room for improvement,4,29 December 2007,This lattest attempt at a aliens vs predator movie is far better than the first. for a start the story line is little more believable than the first attempt it takes place on current day earth where a predator space ship crash lands on earth releasing face huggers that release xenomorphs on the human population. Another thing that offers some appeal to this movie is the MA15+ rating which means that this not a sugar coated offering like the last attempt where by the violence was kept to minimum. there is however huge improvements to be made the story was still far from perfect. In this offering you do get to see the predalien for the first time and you do catch a glimpse of the predator home world. I can only hope the next movie will be better again.,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

This isn't No Country, or Aliens. This is a movie in which takes two very different franchises and tries to combine them with a different story to mix it up a little.If it was in the jungle, too much like Predator, in the Colonies, too much like aliens, these two films take aliens and predators away from the excellent settings( well maybe not Predator 2.) and change it dramatically. It cant be Good movie-wise, it can just be fun, and thats what it is. So what if the acting is bad, and there's some plot holes, its worth watching if you enjoyed the two franchises. Just don't expect it to be a Good Movie, just a fun one.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
829,temcl2,AVP: Requiem is a waste of everyone's time,2,3 February 2008,"This movie simply was bad. The acting, horrible. The plot, terrible. The scenery/editing, just plain bad you could barely see what was going on. This movie lacked in all critical areas except in appearance of the creatures and some of the weapons used by the predator. The whole premise of this movie and experience felt like a straight to DVD movie, such as ""feast"". Some nice death scenes but everything else was a waste of time. It really sucks as a fan of both these proud franchises to see them fall so much. Action alone does not make a movie unless you do it right like ""commando"", lol. But seriously just a plain bad movie with two of cinemas favorite monsters. Please put this series to rest please. And who the f*** is Yeutani?",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
830,gilliannicol,"this is not an alien or predator movie, it's rubbish",1,2 January 2008,"I have to agree with the hi-jaking comment. This movie is neither an alien or a predator movie. It completely destroys any aesthetic that had been built up in the movies before it... could just about go with the premise of the first one, and thought it OK, but the small town America of this film is the worst location for an alien movie. this isn't horror, this movie isn;t sci-fi, and I find it kinda upsetting what they have done which kind of ruins the memory and enjoyment of the first alien films and predator title. Please if there is another, put it on another planet where it belongs. Also the baby pregnancy scene gets my vote for most unnecessarily revolting scene in a movie ever. What is the point of the film? Please, do not see.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Although i didn't even payed for it and sneak in, i would have rather pay 10 dollars to see Enchanted again. I understand that some movies are just meant to entertain, using violence, action, gore, and suspense,and this movie did have all of those, however, it seems like some high school kids from a drama class with a camcorder can do better than this. When the Alien was fighting Predator, all I could see was their face moving back and forth and i would assume that one of them got hit by reading their facial expression. and when they was not shot close up(90% of the time), the fight scene looks like two action figures bumping into each other. i wanted to cause a car accident after seeing this crap. and for the people who said this was good, they are on crack. i watch this because a good review was display on this page, but i should have click on more summaries. save yourself some time and watch the trailer and use the power of imagination.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
832,compgeek33,Excellent If You Skip The Acting,9,31 January 2008,"To put it short, the actors suck bad and do not help the credibility of the film, but last time I checked, it's Alien vs Predator so they're the only characters to pay attention to. The predator is a real badass here, being a ruthless scavenger taking no prisoners while the aliens look very old school with the closeup shots and noises. The old predator music that was in the first 5 minute trailer was not included here which sucked cause I thought it was a nice touch. The Barack Obama cop gets owned for being naive and Dallas and that Sigourney Weaver chick come off pretty good at the end since they knew better of the army's agenda.Overall, if I skip the non-predator non-alien scenes in the beginning, the buildup to the chaos at the end keeps me stoked, so it's nice to watch once and a while for my Predator fix, but nothing beats the original. I could go for a sequel, but just put some Clive Owens or Tom Berringers or Gary Oldmans (give me your own lists if you disagree) to ensure quality.Ms. Yutani...must be Chinese",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

I was waiting for Alien 5 so patiently and now this came out. I know now it is impossible to continue the saga while it was destroyed with this film. ""Hey wait the minute, the government don't lie to people!!"" says one of the actress. Hello!!! The script is awful, direction also and the effects terrible, I'd rather not mention the act. At first I thought the first part was awful!! I feel like someone was making fool of himself and us. I think ""they"" should decide which movie should go out in public, not damaging the previous parts. So, I guess Alien 5 or Predator 3 are out of the question. Greg",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

It has great action, gore and storyline that you won't find it bored half way and leave.The bad points about this film is that the fight scenes is very dark, and between the predalien/alien and predator fights you don't know who's is who.It has few jumpy parts in it, but mostly you can tell when it's going to surprise you...Overall i say it's a 7 out of 10, i don't know why other people give such low score, personally i'm not too big of a fan of alien and predator films but it's definitely better than the first AVP and doesn't deserve lower than 6.It's a decent, above average film and a must watch for 2008 or just wait till the DVD comes out for this.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
835,thedude7778,"Well, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor were great, but George Segal's character lacked depth and empathy.",7,30 December 2007,"Dear Haters, Please. Give me a break.Anyone who thought the script, acting and direction in this film was going to get it put up for ten different Academy Awards, in all fairness, had made up their minds that it was terrible before they even set foot in the theater.This was not supposed to be The Greatest Sci-Fi/Horror Film Ever Made. It was not supposed to be Alien, Aliens, Alien3, The Terrible Fourth Movie, Predator, or Predator 2. Paul Anderson set the tone for this series when he raped the two franchises three years ago. This one was making up ground.Hard to connect with the characters or feel anything for them? Sure, no one's supposed to feel anything when the Guy who likes the Girl gets emasculated and cold-cocked by the Bully, or a mother and daughter watching their husband/father getting torn apart three feet from them. What, did you cry your eyes out when Danny Archuleta got boned like a fish? Did you feel your soul being torn loose from it's moorings when the Warden got pulled up into the ceiling? How about when Jesse Ventura got his chest opened up, did you lose sleep over it? Seriously. Yeah, maybe the characters could have been developed a little more, but if you went in expecting Ripley, Hicks, Dutch, or Harrigan, again, you set yourself up for disappointment.You think the PredAlien looked ridiculous? Would you have preferred the asinine Newborn? As for it being in the dark all the time and never getting a good look at it, go back and watch Alien and tell me if you get a good, long look at it until the end where Parker and Lambert are killed. Here's a hint: YOU DON'T.Regarding the continuity, it does make sense if you think about it like this: We know for a fact, confirmed by the end of Predator 2, that they've been coming to earth since at least the 1700's, so there's no, ""Where did they come from?"" Mystery there. Regarding the Aliens, let's assume that this takes place long before Alien. After all the traces of them are wiped out by the Nuke, you have these four survivors who can account for what the Alien is and what it can do. The Asian lady at the end is obviously one of the founders of Weyland-Yutani, the evil corporation which sends the Nostromo out to investigate the signal from the derelict. Hence, they've *heard* about them, know they exist, and want to know more, but they can't because they're all vaporized. So, when they find out that, hey, that thing on Kane's face is the same alien we've been looking for since Colorado, we have to get it, and all other priorities are rescinded. I'm sure this explanation isn't good enough, but seeing as how nothing likely ever will be for those who hated it, just close your eyes and keep repeating the words, ""Non-canon. Non-canon. Non-canon.""Call me a fan-boy and mock me. I don't really care. Everyone has their niche -- their brand of movie which gives them goosebumps and pulls the grin across their face for two hours. For some people, it's intense dialog, character development, and unpredictable plot twists. For others, it's two hours of acid blood, headthwacks, wrist-blades, infrared-vision, and which little Indian is next to get gutted. We don't care if it won't win Best Snooty Art-House Picture Of The Year. We don't care if the acting is a ladder-step above those bad monster flicks they show on the SciFi channel on weekends.You should have left your highly-advanced sense of cinematic mastery in the parking lot. This movie did not ask you for it.To everyone who has not seen this movie and liked Aliens/Predator series: This is not any of the previous six films, nor does it try to be. It stands on it's own.If you like mindless action and gruesome killing, you'll love it.

836,eriks-8,Deserves more credit....,8,19 January 2008,"I think this movie was very entertaining throughout, lots of action and Aliens all over the place and causing havoc in some small town.I fail to understand why so many people think this film is so bad, first of all, movies are meant to be entertaining and this movie will entertain you from the start.I have read a lot of bad reviews on here and while might be valid some are just plain stupid, for example: Someone said that ""when Predators are defeated they have to activate the bomb they carry to clean up the area, NOT to send a distress call"".... - Well... the Predator DID activate the bomb but seems you missed the bit when the Alien rips that whole limb out breaking the wrist controller in the process!Another moan I read: When the Predator activates the wrist bomb to destroy the ship it should have created a bigger explosion... -- Well... Mr... when did you learn how to read Predatorian (Predator's language). You will agree that they have far superior technology compared to ours, right? are you going to tell me that they cant adjust the bomb to not be as powerful? Anyway, my point is, EVERY film ever made could be criticized to make it look like a crap film, this film is entertaining and that is what films are meant to do, had this been Predator 1 you would all be moaning on how stupid the concept of an alien with vast superior technology not being able to adjust his visor to see a mud-covered Arnie is.You would also think Star Wars was a piece of doo doo, I mean, if we analyze that film like you are analyzing AvP2 it would sound really bad... for example, how does Capt Solo, Luke, Chewie and Obi-Wan Kenobi manage to get in and undetected inside the biggest base in the known galaxy and then manage to release a prisoner and escape?Is ridiculous, what a crap film! they should have the technology to track them down all over the base and tell them of life-signs inside the ship without having to manual scan it! See what I mean?, 2 classic film and they already sound crappy, maybe is because you all watched those films when you were younger and were easily impressed, I mean, cartoons were awesome when I was younger!btw, I love Star Wars and Predator :)",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Someone somewhere put the bug in the ear at rotten tomatoes and boom, illogical low rating.The music, fantasy effects and overall feel are 100% from a comic book world.

I cant understand All the negative comments it's received. you people need to realise its not real! I know i didn't go down to my local cinema expecting an epic movie with human drama, no, I went to see two of the scariest Alien races kick the S**T out of each other. And let me tell you i wasn't disappointed. This time round it feels so much like the movies of the 80's we all came to love. Sure its dark in parts, but that the whole point! Was Alien or Aliens any lighter i ask? no, and the way it was shot really gave it the edge the first AvP so dearly lacked. (I am not going to slate that movie neither, although AvPr is ten times better in my opinion) It is nearly on par with the said movies of yester year! The Acting by the cast members wasn't as horrible as a lot make out. i actually feel that because, they ain't as well known as other Hollywood A listers. there performance was more believable and as true to life as you can get. The Special effects Rocked and this time round they looked more like they did in previous instalments. much more scary! The Predator Was Awsume and i was rooting for him the whole time.I hope i have not given away anything for people who haven't seen it yet. please do not be put off by the nagative comments this movie has received. Go to this movie for a fun night out. We all know its a sci-fi flick and make the most of it. I mean, Did the other films Have Believable plots? well maybe predator 1 and the Alien trilogy.

856,Funky_Clunk,How can a trailer be so misleading...,1,11 February 2008,"The trailer for this film actually had me excited, so with expectations of a pleasant surprise I went of to the local cinema ready for a good solid cinematic experience. Oh how wrong I was...In its most basic form the plot is solid and gets the job done. A predalien (explained in the last film) crash lands on earth, closely followed by the last surviving predator that is out for revenge. However, the problem is that the humans are stuck in the middle of a fight that has nothing to do with them. Sounds like a good story so far? Well don't get your hopes up, as the film them takes a turn for the worse (and believe me, it does get worse!)The film then turns to a group of teenagers so unbelievable and dull, you actually will the aliens to hunt them down, but unfortunately the directors seem to want to focus most of the movie on their unrealistic exploits. Rather than try to escape the city and get away from a likely (and highly welcome death), they decide to run around trying to accomplish something so memorable I haven't a clue what it was.But it gets worse, much worse....The pacing of this film is perhaps the worst I have ever seen. One moment, we are following the predator as he stalks his prey, the next, with no prior warning, the army rolls into town ready for action, but there's one problem with this. We can't see any of it! The camera work is by far a new low point in film history. Why would anybody want to admire the brick work in a sewer when we could be watching an epic fight between the age old enemies? Well it seems we do... And why doesn't the camera stay still. Why bother to render the aliens and predator at all if we aren't even going to get a solid glimpse of them. It doesn't increase the tension; it just destroys it with a sledge hammer.Even the cast don't look interested in this film, maybe they were badly directed, but even so its no excuse, all they had to do was look scared, or maybe angry when in reality all they have done is left me looking extremely angry.So, let's recap, what we have is an incoherent storyline, dreadful pacing, and camera-work that couldn't be worse even if they had tried. Sound like a good movie to you, because it definitely doesn't seem like one to me! The directors should be ashamed of what they have made. They have managed to ruin two once respectable franchises in less than two hours of screen time, and will leave many fans bitterly disappointed. They even throw in a half hearted attempt to shock viewers with a scene in the local hospital, which they also manage to make so distasteful, it's uncomfortable to watch.I managed to find somebody that enjoyed the film and all he could say to defend it was that I was looking at it with the filter glass half empty.

It was every thing I expected it to be and better1! One Predator against millions of Aliens and a PredAlien, which looked awesome by the way! It set itself apart from the first movie when both the father and 8 year old son get face hugged! Plus the killing of newborn babies in the hospital (You don't see it) and how the PredAlien inserted FOUR embryos down the throat of the woman was... It was like every fan across the world got together to make a good Alien Vs Predator movie!

I had read a few comments by people saying this movie was garbage and the first one was way better. I am saying that this was a pretty cool movie involving action, suspense and quite a bit of gore.I saw the first one, and it was alright, seeing two famous alien creatures going at it. But after seeing AVP R, it just blows the first one outta the water. It has a single predator(who is pretty much a badass, except towards the very end, where he gets tossed around by the PredAlien) going into ""clean up"" a situation about a hybrid Predator/ Alien, that is killing anything in it's path. It can ""create"" more Aliens, making it a lot more of a challenge, hence"" Aliens Vs. Predator"". Yes there is a plot; ""Don't get killed by the monsters"". There's a story for the humans, involving a teenager and his crush on some girl, his ex-con brother, and a sheriff, discovering the first deaths, by the face huggers.In the end, you should definitely see this movie. Don't believe the haters, they are just whiny babies. The only negative thing that really, really bugged me, was that it was way too dark. You can discern what is happening for the most part, but it is as if the Brothers Struase were using candles for lighting.

It lacked depth for the poor human characters who were beings laughtered left and right, but we all know this movie's real star was the Predator and his hunt to contain an alien infestation, so there ya go. Better than the first AvP and Alien Resurrection, I'd say. And the predalien was a worthy addition to the mythos of the Aliens. Warning: I wouldn't take little kids to this. Children, pregnant women, and even babies are made short work of in this film when the predalien takes up residence in the hopsital.

I only have one large complaint: In 90 percent of the action sequences I couldn't see a thing. I watched this in the theater and on dvd with hight contrast settings. In swear to every thing that is holy - I could not see anything! There was a scene where the camera panned for 2min over absolute blackness while epic battle music was playing. What I liked about his movie was how the predator was practically not a hunter but janitor cleaning up the mess. Some characters were likable but mostly flat - which is OK because they are redshirts anyway. I love how this movie has action from beginning to end, and doesn't take to long to pick up the pace. That the plot was not very deep is a OK in my book. I mean the the title is Alien vs. Predator. Any movie with something vs. Something in the title is not going to be an intelectula challenge.

Not sure why so many people hate it, its better than Predator 2, or Aliens 3 for that matter. Watching the predator hunt was cool, and the pred-alien, while a bit of a gimmick was still fun. Would have liked to see more of prdator homeworld and culture, but oh well. For the people that said this is more horror than sci-fi, well it took place on Earth, not in space.

It did have some pointless, boring, and stupid dialogue, but that's to be expected.

869,buugcjdzcqqbls,Before I say anything else about 'AVP: Requiem',10,4 June 2021,"Let me first say this: it's actually pretty crummy cinema. The lighting is near always dark and murky, the action sequences are filmed in such a disorienting way that it's near impossible to tell who's winning, the characters are little more than one note cardboard cutouts, and the plot itself is little more than-you guessed it- Aliens and Predators going at it for 86 minutes. BUT, if all you want for your buck is two of the most beloved monster franchises ever battling their way through an R-rated sci-fi schlock fest, then here you go. Not only is this AVP immeasurably better than the first, PG-13 rated entry, but it's also way more reverent of both franchises' roots- unlike the first film, this one actually feels like an Alien or Predator movie, and the Brother's Strause should be commended for capturing the mood of the classic films. But don't take that as suggesting that this is as good as Ridley Scott's 'Alien', James Cameron's 'Aliens', or John McTiernan's 'Predator'- 'AVP: Requiem' has more in common with 'Alien 3' and 'Predator 2' in terms of quality and origninality. But that doesn't stop it from being bloody good entertainment, which leads me to say what I thought I would never say: all hail 'AVP 3'!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

No, it's not. I can understand some people not liking it, but it did what it meant to do almost perfectly (it is a bit pooly lit admittedly). Here's the story. Aliens drop onto a quiet little mountain town. Predator follows it into a quiet little mountain town. The obvious ensues. If you wanted something else, then no it's not for you.

Everything is a waste of film here and totally unoriginal. Some examples of it are a total copy of the Ripley/Newt pair from Aliens and once they get down to the core players, one of them is named ""Dallas"" just like the captain from Alien.I think one of the things that bothers me is they changed how the Aliens reproduce and it actually disgusts me by how the Alien/Predator hybrid is shown implanting multiple embryos into pregnant women about to give birth.They ignore or violate nearly every rule about horror movies.I absolutely LOVE the Alien series but *this* film is something else....I actually regret watching it.

Predator: Requiem is a good follow up to the first movie, but has too many issues to be considered a good movie on its own.",10,5 July 2021,"AVP: Requiem is best described as a slasher film, except the humans aren't being stalked by Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees; they're being stalked by Xenomorphs. This in itself is a great concept. While the original AVP wasn't horrible like some people make it out to be, the whole Predators hunting Xenomorphs for sport inside an underground arctic temple was just a little too outlandish for me. Having a Predator hunt down Xenomorphs to protect their anonymity from the humans is a much more grounded idea. I personally wasn't offended by the original AVP's PG-13 rating, but the directors clearly heard the complaints of the people that were. They went all in on the R rating. Heck, the only reason the movie is called Requiem is so that it could signify its R existence! I definitely enjoyed the R content over the PG-13 stuff of the original, so that was a plus for this movie. But the huge complaint everyone has with this movie is that the characters have absolutely no depth to them whatsoever. Each person is given a name and one stereotypical trait. Because I could care less about who lived and who died, it really took away from the usual excitement about seeing Xenomorphs slowly pick off humans. On top of that, all the characters constantly make the usual dumb horror mistakes, so it doesn't exactly feel realistic either.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

This film is another Perfect example of hyper-realism. This ""new"" alien isn't really That new, because the Alien universe has shown that if it is a Different creature, the Form is different, Alien^3, Prometheus (as bad as this film was), and more. The Alien is not the problem with this movie, it is the Audience Viewing this film. Why? Because his movie is Nasty, like ""OMG I can't believe they did that!"" Nasty. It has some scenes that would make you puke if it was your first horror film, and is Not for the whole family. If this film was shown in the 60's, there would be riots and mass panic in the streets and rated A. This film is made for the Hardcore Sci-Fi fans who want some Intel on how to survive when things get Real Bad, like what happens in this movie. This movie has bad acting, but why does it work? Because this is some hick-town with ""normal"" people living in a small area. What, Samuel L Jackson and Tom Cruise are going to be the residents of some mountain town? No, and since people forgot because of all the super-star Marvel Crap, regular people are Not Great Actors In Real Life, which was the Entire Purpose here. These people, normal and regular people, Get Attacked By Aliens, and it does a Fantastic job showing off just how Vicious and Cruel this alien is, and how Ruthless and Brutal the Predators are about them. It is a magnificent film, and shows you just how Dangerous these things are. Remember Ripley in Alien1+2+3? Remember how she kept telling them, and by extent You, the Viewer, how dangerous these aliens are, and how they would destroy All Life Everywhere? Yeah, This film is the result of them thinking about this, and it is Shocking. Shocking and Perturbing, and makes you Think.

Over and over again I read how terrible the acting was. Do people honestly think Gene Hackman and Glenn Close were going to sign on for AVP-R? It's a monster movie, folks! The budget is going to the F/X and the alien suits. Let's focus on what fans want to see in a flick like this.Does it have action? In spades. Check.Are the aliens (and preds) badass? Check.Do humans get toasted inventively along the way? Double check.Is there a satisfying ending? Well, maybe not, but we're not talking Shawshank Redemption here.AVP-R succeeds where its predecessor did not by having action galore set largely in a dark, claustrophobic setting. Ever wonder what it would be like having aliens invade your town? Here you go. Anderson's AVP had about 3 action scenes in it (and they were better than given credit for) but it was basically a snoozefest.In this film the Wolf Predator spends most of the film tracking down and destroying the xenomorphs before they can take over the happy state of Colorado. He is a complete BAMF and you root for him, whether he's waxing aliens, deputees, or using hapless humans as bait to nab more aliens. In an odd way he reminded me of Batman from the DarkKnight Detective Comics: a forbidding, shadowy figure who hunts down killers in the night. The Hybrid proves a worthy nemesis, clashing with the Wolf several times (albeit briefly) before they lock horns for good in the end. The fight could've been longer, but it was still pretty good. Maybe it'll be extended in the DVDversion.The other big complaint I've read is how dark the film is, with the action difficult at times to follow. Fair point, but 2 suggestions. One, sit to the back of the theater-thing swill look clearer. 2, as another poster mentioned, it will likely be lightened up in the DVD release, which I fully intend to purchase.Way too much heat given to this film, which should be accepted for what it is: a violent, satisfying creature flick that smartly tips its hat to the previous films in the series. No, it's not as good as Alien, Aliens, or the original Predator, but I think it's better than the other 4 movies in the series. Just relax, have fun, and turn off your brain for 90 minutes.

It was the inevitable announcement of the sequel premiering this Christmas.Given said premise, ask yourself these questions: an alien aboard of a spaceship - does that mean the spaceship is going to be in trouble (yes/no)? If that spaceship is above earth, do you think it will crash on earth (yes/no)? Will the aliens on board of that ship survive (yes/no)? If they survive, does that spell problems for the nearest population (yes/no)? Does this setup lead to the inevitable escape of a group of survivors, that is slowly losing members due to attacks of aliens (yes/no)? Will they make their final escape (yes/no)? Do you think you care about the surviving characters (yes/no)?If any of these questions come as surprise to you and you're puzzled over what their answers are, you must definitely see AvP:R. It's probably you who is part of the target audience that the producers are gambling on, to bring them a profitable Christmas.For those who wonder why there are no questions relating to predators, ask yourself what could a predator possibly add?

Actually a terrible storyline that a 12 year old could have come up with, bad guys come and other semi bad guy follows to kill the bad guy while us humans were stuck in the middle of the blood shed.

It's an unwritten rule of the genre: kids do not die violent deaths! Whenever there's a child in Alien movie, he/she remains unhurt or we at least do not see her suffering to death (I am talking Newt here).In this repulsive flick children start dying in the very first minutes. The creators of the movie hate kids so much, they continue killing them in maternity wards (the scene with dead newborns is horrendous, and here's when I stopped watching the movie) and in mother's wombs - yes, the directors (via Alien) kill the pregnant woman who was giving birth.I strongly believe there's a law, in the States or at least in some other country that prevents showing violence performed to minors in movies. If there's such law, I hope that some human rights agency sues Strause Bros or their sponsors. And I do hope that owners of Aliens franchise won't hire them again.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

From what I've read, you either love the movie or you hate it: that's your business. If you don't love aliens and predators, then don't waste $8. Sure, I agree, there were plot holes and the characters weren't developed enough, and perhaps if the movie was longer, their budget was greater or they had some better actors the movie would have been a bigger hit. (Even though the action and the CGI's were awesome!) But they didn't and it wasn't. The great thing about it was that they had some kick-ass action. The soundtracks and some of the scenes were taken from the original alien/predator movies, but overall it is a GOOD movie. SPOILER AHEAD... And yeah, they killed a little boy and some pregnant women, maybe even some newborns...but I mean, come on big deal! Don't completely disown the Strause brothers for going to an area where no one else had enough guts to go. Sure, they killed a kid. It's not like children are completely safe from harm when it comes to killer aliens from outer space. They saved enough children in the first alien and predator movies. It's about time. I'm just saying, it gives it more of a realistic feel. They did save that one kid...I, personally, loved the movie, as for the rest of you, go see it and develop your own opinion, because I can't do that for you. I just simply tried to give the movie some more dignity. It was GOOD, not terrible, unwatchable and so horrendously set up that all you get out of it is a good nap. It is a good idea and I'm sure that there are plenty of people that could have made it better. And I'm sure that a lot of things could have been made better. But it's done and we should just live with what's there. Maybe one day an even better director will revive it and make AvP3, who knows? And maybe people will love it. And by the way, some of the ""major plot holes"" that many of you found could be explained and made logical. All I wish is that the characters were developed more. Other than that, good movie--and that predator kicked ass, even though there was only one. If you hate it, then don't watch it. If you love it, like me, good for you--buy it when it comes out on DVD.

I am a fan of both the Alien and the Predator films but I had to walk out on AVP-R after approx. 45+ minutes. I wasn't expecting any more than the first AVP film...that film wasn't great but it was acceptable...This was a total waste of time and money. (but not mine, I asked for and received a full refund) Where to begin?...This was so darkly filmed that it was nearly impossible to follow what was happening in some of the more important scenes...like the one early in the beginning with the battle between the Predator and the Alien in the sewer...so darkly lighted and filmed that I could not follow the action at all and the editing just seemed to make it worse.... If I'm paying to see the Predator vs Alien fight then I'd at least like to see them fight without having to guess what is taking place on the screen. I guess the co-directors missed that day in film class. Next, the script or lack of script...this story seems more like 20 people each submitted a post-it note with an idea and the directors just proceeded to film each one without regard to the others. This was just a group of flat clichés without one interesting character in the bunch. The acting in this film is terrible which normally wouldn't be too much of a consideration since the Alien vs Predator match up is the main reason for the film , the rest of the characters/actors aren't that key to the film but the acting in this film is so bad that it's distracting...you get better acting on ""The Real World"" or ""General Hospital"" When I read that they gave this AVP sequel to a pair of untested co-directors I expected the worst but was hoping that they would at least deliver something that was watchable, but this is a total piece of crap, unfortunately.I could go on and on (yeah, even though I walked out after 45 minutes) but by now you should get the idea. Please don't waste your time, money or eyesight on this piece of junk.

I can't remember how many times as I watched the movie I would be like, ""wow, bad take on Aliens"". Be it from the strong relationship between the Ripley and Newt characters to driving around town in the military ""APC"" vehicle. The sonar audio used at the army facility mimicked that of the motion trackers used in Aliens as well. The background music was all too similar towards the end of the film and the hallway at the hospital was an Aliens throwback.All in all, I was very disappointed in the film and just remember...James Cameron along with Sigourney Weaver and Ridley Scott approached FOX with an Alien sequel - but was discarded for the AVP series instead. Now because of this, the series may never recover.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
891,UltramanDeL,Awesome but...,7,9 February 2009,"Aliens...Predators...on Earth. How can a film go wrong? To me, AVP2 is an awesome film but also has its flaws. It delivers a definite sequel and stayed true in continuing the ending of AVP. Requiem has an awesome cast especially Reiko Aylesworth (from previous ""24""), who should have stuck to her role as an operative or agent (like in 24) instead of being in the military (I don't see her as a jarhead). Anyway the action is solid although nothing new (aliens fighting predators, humans getting between their brawls..) which kept me entertained, some were funny and some were serious.All in all I gave it a 7/10.It could've been higher if it was based on the arcade. With Big Arnie as Maj. Shaeffer and Ayame Misaki as Lt. Kurosawa...boy now THAT would be 10/10.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
892,harvey_tunnel,El Stinko,1,28 December 2007,"Where do I begin? The mythic Aliens and the majestic Predators in a small-town/high school teenage drama? Astounding was the blatant casting attempts to mimic Sigouney Weaver as Ripley, Carrie Henn as Newt, the cigarette man from X Files, the Colonial Marines, Jesse Ventura, not to mention casting 20 and 30 year old guys as teenagers, and rehashed excerpts from the other movies in this series - as well as some of the el cheapo movies that ripped off ""Alien"" concepts, etc etc. The couple of things I thought that were clever , and about 30 seconds of decent visuals were overshadowed by the incredibly lame aspects of this film (plot, acting, lighting, cinematography, for instance). Why have a kick-ass predator in the same movie where a major character-defining moment is when the sensitive high school pizza delivery guy gets beaten up by his ex-girlfriend's new jock boyfriend? Ooops, if that was a spoiler, I sincerely apologize. About 20 minutes into the film, there were things I thought were gonna happen, but didn't. I was surprised that one of the ""teens"" did not turn out to be an android, er, I mean artificial human. I was also expecting the aliens and predator to converse in gruff, wrestler's voices. Maybe that will be in the director's cut. In this age of cheap, but high quality, digital video equipment and software, maybe its time for some of those who hate what Hollywood has done to these (Alien and Predator) and other franchises, to come up with their own visions to share instead of passively waiting for the next stinkbomb to appear at your local cinema.

They pushed the envelope with the cheesiness for the movie, the acting was so dramatic when it really didn't need to be and that makes a movie seem unprofessional. The action and horror were OK but nothing to brag about and the sheer fact that there was only 1 predator throughout the movie actually made me very angry. This AVP was simply a cheesy Sci-Fi survival horror type action flick and you all know there gonna make 3rd one AND! let me not forget that they take one of the most famous lines in all of movie history and BUTCHER it in this god awful movie to end 2007.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

I was looking forward to this movie and saw it first show on Christmas day. The Predators are cool, the Aliens are cool and the Hybrid is a new twist, Other than that the acting was horrible, just downright terrible. I will not bother with spoilers, don't waste your time with this one wait for it to go to DVD. I can not believe how horrible the acting was, I was tempted to walkout but stayed in the hopes it would get better, I should have listened to my instincts. Sorry to say all this, I am a fan of this series and was horrified more with the crappy acting than the action on screen. Steer clear of this one in the theaters and see something else.

895,predatorlp,"Overall the movie was better than AVP, but by a minor step.",5,5 January 2008,"I had great hopes for this movie. I thought it could be the savior of the series and a glimpse of hope we would be seeing better sequels from now on. The trailers were superb and everything looked if not great, at least okay. I have to admit when leaving the cinema I felt the same way after watching AVP and Kingdom of Fire. Disappointed and confused.I walked with an open mind and the beginning got me really hyped (although I have watched it a hundred times on my computer). But after 15-20 minutes it started to get boring. I understood why the town setting was a bad idea. It just didn't fit the creatures and somewhat cheapened them. The atmosphere was...well, there wasn't a atmosphere. There was no horror, no suspense, nothing. Even the action wasn't all that good. The pacing was jumpy and the build up wasn't good. I wanted to see mass carnage, but there were a few people killed and suddenly the whole town was evacuated. I didn't mind the acting, but there were some really stupid lines (mostly from Dallas and Sheriff Morales). My biggest complain is the color grading. The goddamn picture was so dark, really annoying! For the creatures themselves...uhh, we all know the aliens weren't scary at all and their mouths looked like crap in most of the shots. Wolfy boy was cool, but the roar...God, was it terrible. Even the AVP Predators tiger roar sounded more believable. What was this? A 80's grind house monster roar? The Predalien was OK, but could've been a lot better.There were some good stuff too. Seeing the med kit return, the Predvision was really cool at the factory, the score was superb (tribal drums), Jesse's ass, blue liquid, Jesse's ass, the fight between the Predator and the Predalien, Jesse's ass, Jesse's ass...hmm, that's all I can think of so far. Oh yeah, and Wolfy stomping on the alien. Can't decide if I liked the hospital scene and Chet's reproduction method.Overall the movie was better than AVP, but by a minor step. There were many problems, there were some good moments, but it didn't feel like an AVP movie. I'm so wanting a big budget, descent writer, good director, actor cast and a space setting right about now.Damn you, FOX! You did it again.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
896,puntomatt,"DO NOT see this film, watch Aliens instead it's much more rewarding",2,19 January 2008,"Just went to see this film and unfortunately it was gash-pap of the worst kind. Seriously, several times I had to stop myself from shouting at the screen it was so awful. Just about every line of dialog from the film is lifted directly from from the first 2 Alien films and the first Predator film with some action scenes borrowed from all films.They've also taken some diabolical liberties with the Alien life-cycle, instead of 1 or 2 days to go from face-hugger to cute little chest buster it now takes less than 8 hours (estimated by me) to get from face-hugger to immense army of fully grown warrior aliens - WTF were they thinking!!!There was only one bit in the film that provoked a positive response from me - so much of a response in fact that I punched the air and shouted ""f*cking take that!!"" and that was when the Predator took out a main character. I've never done that before in any film, EVER, but it didn't come close to making up for the rest of this dreadful mess. I couldn't stop putting my head in my hands, again something I've not done before - I felt a bit like Rain Man when someone goes in for a hug. Must be a sign of how strongly I feel for the franchises I grew up with.*spoiler* I was discussing with my brother after we came out if the Alien-Predator hybrid is a worse alien than the shockingly bad Resurrection Alien. I was on the fence but thinks the Resurrection Alien is worse. The Alien-Predator hybrid is a good idea but I feel it was executed very badly, it wasn't majestic or elegant like the regular Alien and for some unknown reason it could impregnate victims through its mouth parts - where did this come from?? is this how Predators mate??? why are they giving me all these annoying questions to ask.*spoiler over*Aliens is my favorite film of all time and watching this has actually sullied my feelings for the franchises somewhat, sometime I never thought could be possible. My recommendation for everyone wishing to experience this atrocity is to save your sanity, put on Aliens instead before Fox ruin the franchise for you too.This film doesn't deserve an out-of-ten rating as my head might exploded weighing up the pro against the multitude of cons. I feel sick now thinking about it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

I know a lot of people don't seem to understand why they would only send one Predator (Yaujta for those of you that don't know so that's how I''ll refer to them from now on.) to take on the outbreak. It actually makes a lot of sense if you look at their culture. The single Yaujta is probably a warrior or an elder, therefore highly skilled and more than capable of handling the situation....or at least that's what the yaujta think at the time.

There's a cheesy subplot in the middle of a girl and guy who like each other, but nobody cares at all...the girl dies anyway...""If Chuck Norris had dreads""....SHUT UP!!!!!Chuck Norris wouldn't waste his time sitting in a theater being ""captured"" by an amusingly terrible flick...if i were him i'd roundhouse kick the director/producer/all the actors....They try to make up for all the wannabe heroic acting with gory deaths every 5 minutes, and try to call it a thriller with those shocking moments we the audience unfortunately expect like a Nightmare on Elm Street movie...ooooo cool the once assumed dead predator is now a neato hybrid Predatalien...how awesome, of course there's the expected duel to the death between him and the manly Chuck Norris predator in the end...If I was to be positive on anything, the girl was pretty hot, and the deaths (every 5 minutes) were fairly amusing from time to time...my advice: don't waste your money and see something else...",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
899,kyle-395,A truly great Alien and Predator film!,10,3 January 2008,"Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, despite what other viewers say, is truly a great film. To me, this movie is like a combination of Aliens and Predator. This movie was jam-packed with action, gore, and plenty of violence! Basically what happens is, that the movie starts where the original AVP left off. The Predalien bursts out of the predator 'Scar' and kills the other predators on their ship, causing it to crash in the Colorado woods. A father and son hunting nearby, come to investigate and end up getting attacked by some face huggers that escaped the wreckage. Back on the Predator home world, a truly bad-ass predator receives a distress signal from the down ship and gears up to go and clean up the mess. The next few scenes are basically getting to know the main characters and their stories. People start to go missing and soon, the predators and aliens and predalien, duke it out in an underground sewer system, take the battle to a power plant, a restaurant, a store (where the few main characters are hold up), a school, a hospital, and finally, the big roof-top battle. My favorite scenes were definitely when the predator stalks the people in the forest, and all the scenes in the hospital. This movie had everything I had hoped an AVP movie would have, and more! There were only two tiny things that i thought were wrong. This movie is very dark, lighting wise, and sometimes I thought that some of the fights were a bit too dark, so that you couldn't really see much of what was going on. It wasn't that big a deal. Another thing, which both AVP movies have in common, is timing. They go by two fast. Or at least the beginning of this one did. One thing they should do to try and fix that is going back to the way that the original films started up. Slow and calm, like Alien. I think that would help with timing and maybe get these movies a little more paced and suspenseful. If you haven't already seen this movie, then I recommend seeing it as soon as possible, because you will love it, whether you are a fan or not!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
900,jonathanegerton,"A movie that will succeed in boring you to death, lame lame!!",1,29 January 2008,"You know, Sigourney Weaver insisted in the early nineties that her character in Alien, Ellen Ripley should die as to save herself from the contractual obligations of being involved with this terrible franchise. Now if a fantastic actress and intelligent person such as Ms. Weaver can foresee the terrible merging of such strong alien races, why the hell didn't the chiefs at 20th Century Fox? AVP2 is so awful you are compelled almost to leave after it has begun, however after buying your ticket and for the mere appearance of Giger's alien you stay. A bad idea. The alien effects where cheap and tacky, the scene with the predator/alien hybrid coming out of the sewer was awful as was the scene in the maternity ward. The film even ripped off Aliens with a tank chase and alien/marine fight. Nothing new, nothing memorable but for the awful performance of everyone involved.Please make this one the last and make Alien 5 instead.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
901,exploring808,The first one was better,4,7 January 2008,"I saw this movie with the understanding that it was not going to be Oscar Material. I like the first one relatively well and thought that this one was going to be different from any other Alien movies that have been made. After all it takes place in any town USA right now 2008. No fancy space labs or futuristic colonies. It was my back yard and I found it interesting to see how normal people would deal with this unique problem. I was hoping for too much. You see, Logic and Common sense were missing from this film. I know it's a Science Fiction, and my beef is not with the Aliens or the Predator, Case In Point: *Spoiler Alert* -When the small group of survivors, comes upon what is left of the National Guard Unit that came in the save them, and they take control of the armored personnel carrier. Why not drive that out of town??? It's a frinkn' tank people, you're going to save in it! It can survive mines and RPGs, let alone Aliens jumping on it! If the roads were blocked.again a tank. Instead, let's stay in town and go to the hospital and find a helicopter that may or may not be there any more. The reasoning, because army girl says she know what the army is going to and it is contain so not point driving out again in a tank. What is the difference between fly out in a helicopter then tanking the tank outwould the army still try to contain you by shooting you down?-The Military was poorly misrepresented. What was the army girl speciality..everything? She can fly helicopters, shot every weapon, drive a tank Her uniform wasn't even right! I was in Iraq, I am pretty sure I would get put in jail if I brought back some Night Vision Google's for my little girl.

902,macngrace,Instant Classic,7,29 April 2008,"I can feel it in my bones, AVP:R will be a legendary film, right up there with Citizen Kane.No, that's wrong, it's a dreadful film. Dreadful and delicious. Not only is it the ultimate formula movie, but it's a feast of slam-bang violence and action/terror that I laugh at myself for enjoying so much. And, it's a celebration of two of the greatest extra-terrestrial baddies ever put on film (almost as good as Jabba the Hutt).This is the story of how the Alien (introduced in Alien of 1979) first became known to the human race. True, earthlings found it years earlier as depicted in the first AVP movie, but because of that battle of the big mommas, the Alien infected a Predator ship, causing it to crash in an Amrican forest and thereby infect the unsuspecting town. A singular Predator comes down from his home planet to ""clean up"" the mess, turning a seemingly normal small town evening into one of total chaos.Suspend disbelief, enjoy all the references from the other films, from the score, to the sound effects, to the plot points (a predator hunting in the jungle, aliens nesting in the sewers, army commandos, the muscle-car charge through the town, the alien farm, etc.). I, for one, admire the boldness of the Strause brothers in regards to the body count and the amazing amount of exploding heads. It's a spectacle that only contemporary Hollywood could squeeze out, a take-no-prisoners bloodfest, the kind I want from this franchise.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
903,hunmark,the worst horror ever made,1,6 January 2008,"I can't imagine anyone on the planet received a bigger present this Christmas morning than Paul W.S. Anderson. While his profoundly sullied name hasn't been rescued from the pits of directorial reputation hell, he can now take comfort in the knowledge that he hasn't directed the worst film to feature Aliens and Predators. When an Alien/Predator hybrid crashes his spaceship in small town Colorado, it kicks off a series of deaths that trigger the attention of the Predator home world. Sending off a top hunter, the Predator comes to Earth on the trail of the Aliens, following them into the community, where they've gone about their business slaughtering the locals and sending Facehuggers out to boost the population numbers. When a band of survivors team up to search for safety, they find not only must they elude the extraterrestrial infestation, but the government as well, who wants to contain the outbreak for study. It boggles the mind to even contemplate how dreadful ""Requiem"" is. The map leading to quality was clearly laid out by Anderson's moronic work with his 2004 installment ""AVP,"" and any filmmaker with half a brain could've manufactured something that restores a little of the glossy ferociousness that marked both the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" franchise over the last three decades with minimal effort. Instead, we meet directorial newcomers Colin and Greg Strause (billed as ""The Brothers Strause""), two random FX flunkies who turn this sequel into a vile, joyless, murky, moronic, amateurish, contemptuous, numbing, unintentionally hilarious, and thoroughly diseased motion picture. It's a perfect film for the Scrooges out there who like their multiplex fodder crude and unrelentingly insulting.I bashed Anderson's take on the material for the cartoon directions it turned. After all, reimagining Predators as stubby football linebackers and staging the flaccid action in a series of cheap-looking sets wasn't exactly an invitation to view film-making ingenuity. However, Anderson is Welles compared to the Brothers Strause, who tear through the film without the slightest clue what they're doing, blindly foraging through the script for the nastiest bits of bodily harm to exploit for the marketing. The boys have no idea how to instruct actors, stage action, explore visual effects, or tell a story. Their function is primarily to oversee madness and somehow pull 80-minutes of tripe together for 20th Century Fox to sell to lenient fanboys flush with holiday cash.As much derision as the Brothers Strause deserve, there are several components faulty with ""Requiem,"" starting with the cinematography by Daniel Pearl, who prefers to light his frame with all the illumination power of a birthday candle. If ""Requiem"" wasn't horrible enough of a picture to start with, it's also impossible to view, with entire chunks of the narrative and action lost to total darkness that seems to defeat the purpose of the shiny new R-rating. Instead, the audience has to squint to see the bloodshed or decipher the expressions (and I use that term ironically) on the actors. It's also futile to figure out what the Aliens and Predators are doing at any given moment of the film. Call me a snob, but I actually enjoying the luxury of watching a movie, not sitting with a black screen listening to a tiresome symphony of hacky sound effects. After shooting ""Captivity"" and ""Pathfinder"" this year to equally exasperating results, Daniel Pearl should be run out of the business.Shane Salerno's screenplay is another deadly tool of ""Requiem,"" placing an interstellar war in the middle of a ""Saved by the Bell"" episode, as one of our ""heroes"" deals with a bland high school crush and persistent teen bullies. The script is really a patchwork quilt of clichés, with every single human merely a bookmark for later monster consumption. It doesn't help matters to have bottom-of-the-barrel actors running around the film, but that doesn't excuse the script's stupidity and bottom-feeding nature. Oh, Salerno not only uses adults as Alien/Predator prey, but little kids, pregnant women strapped to hospital beds, and even throws in threatened newborns to satisfy his black heart. Hey, I was as openly hostile as anyone toward the neutered PG-13 rating of ""AVP,"" but ""Requiem"" rides its R-rating to bleak horizons, replacing the escapism of the scares with puzzling hostility. The anger culminates in a conclusion that's as reckless, cynical, and spineless as anything put on screen this year; a middle-finger to the paying crowd.The initial wave of ""Alien"" films and the first ""Predator"" were mighty classics of cinema; scrappy gorefests that took immense care building characterization and treated dramatic payoff like the ultimate dessert. ""Requiem"" is nothing more than a glorified Sci-Fi Channel Original, teeming with bargain-basement production values, tiring waves of stupidity, and a promise (or threat) of another installment to come. My word, haven't the faithful suffered enough?",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

No one in their right mind would drink Boone's Farm but if it's all the wine you have available and you want to drink, you will do it. And it's the same with this movie.

There was some character development and i have to say that this movie is merciless! I breaks every rule of horror movies...there is no symphaty for anyone. No more predator needs help from humans thing...The predator is there to do its job and it does it with style. If any human interferes, well to bad for them. The only problem of this movie is that it was too short. It was fast paced and all of a sudden, it just ends. Honestly i was expecting one last fight scene...something but then, again this is not your stereotypical horror movie.

I wasn't too thrilled when AvP 1 came out, but all in all I think they did a very good job. And that's where it stops.I went in the theater with an open mind, hoping it would be as good as the first AvP. The start seemed very promising, great camera angles, the quality of the entire film. But besides looking great, that's where the amazement ended. The script presented hollow characters much like a horror flick, where really you didn't care if the people lived or died. Along with mismatched military uniforms/vehicles/weapons, the coordination and attention to detail was clearly FUBAR'd which really distracted me from enjoying the film. In the end the attempts to try and recreate scenes from the original movies just upset me more than anything- especially the scenes that have been recreated over and over in the past movies.They brought in new aliens which could have given the movie potential- had a better script been approved. I think this once and for all has me convinced that they really need to put this to rest.Had I not been a fan of the earlier movies, I might have given this movie a 4.

907,kenichi-3,"Aliens, predators all good things which goes in a circular motion",9,30 January 2008,"I was so sad about all these bad reviews, so i had to give my verdict of this flick - and that is a perfect Nine!Here is my reasons for this verdict are the following.This movie was never intended to hold any deeper plot, Fact! there is simply not time for this, as our famous aliens multiply pretty fast(seen even in ridly's movie)and in less than 24 hours in perfect environment, these WILL multiply. It's all instinct of survival for them, nothing personal. The predator has to clean op the mess we humans only can handle with a sturdy space airlock or something with 40 megaton. Furthermore the main characters in this movie are the aliens and the predator, not the humans (Humans are necessary as they speak English, as well as we need some easy victims). The title indicates that the battle is between aliens and predator - not the humans.I think this movie illustrate greatly how civilians as well the government will react to such a threat and how strangers can unite in a stressed situation. I would say that the movie would be very lame if it has a deeper storyline and in-depth character analysis. This will brake the pace or the stress factor of the movie and furthermore add irrelevance to the movie as they mostly will die sometime in this flick.Now there are many ways to be entertained. we have the deeper and emotional(which scores very high among film critics, but usually bores the hell out of me - such as all the European movies and woody Allen flicks)and Then, we have this(not a deep story just visual pleasure)such as porn-flicks, Tarantino movies, gore movies, martial arts movies, all die hards and the most used action story ""I used to work for some government agency, but now i'm framed"". If you like any of these movies then you know what i talk about, and then this movies is you! - remember the Beers, Smokes and Pizzas and watch it with your best friends:) it's time for rock'n'roll! one more thing boys - its sci-fi! don't be too serious :)",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

This film had plenty of gore and shocking moments(aliens bursting out of pregnant women and little kids). This film has so many things that the first film did not, the main one is violence. The second is that the aliens where shrouded in darkness like the original Alien films. the predator was more.....predator in this one, unlike the first film where when we see there faces it was so disappointing, so on and forth.

Maybe it was the giant and elaborate sewer systems in... Gunnison... or maybe it was the rain forest in the beginning and throughout the movie. Unless it was an overhead shot of the rockies nothing ever in this movie resembled Colorado. It was embarrassing. But that was only the first thing that made this movie the terrible piece that it was. I would certainly not call this a suspense/thriller movie. At no time did I question whether someone was going to die or not.... I was certain that they would. Every ten minutes a new character was introduced and every ten minutes a new character died in an overly brutal way. Children with chest busters and pregnant ladies exploding with aliens. Terrible.Basically, the predators were randomly hovering in the space above Earth and crashed. Aliens ran around everywhere killing people in tasteless ways and then everyone died.

The negative things I saw were the over focus on the human characters, and some of the scenes were a little over the top gory. However, the movie was full of action, excellent effects, and I liked it more than the first AVP mainly because it was a lot faster paced than the first one, which seemed to drag on, and was a little corny at times. And keep in mind this is an AVP movie AND a sequel. You can't expect deep subplots, hidden symbols, and incredible twists and turns in the plot. I normally do not believe in sequels, but I found this one to be decent. Its what I expected, and I liked what I saw for the most part.

But otherwise that the movie should rise up and become number 2 in the top 250 movies making The Eye number one.So I might be stupid to you people(who hate this movie) but NO!I have many reasons this would become number 2. The camera angles,the sci-fi, and the perfect digital(sorry for the spelling mistake)sound.So don't think I'm stupid or crazy this movie will prbolay(sorry)blow your mind apart.9 out of 10.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Before making anymore prequel and sequels, consider their image and what they have gave us in recent years.

913,crushedorangeproductions,Man! I love this movie!,10,21 April 2008,"Okay, so this movie didn't have space marines, but I still liked it. What lacked in the first movie (blood and gore) was delivered in full force for this movie! Some didn't like the teenage cliché's, but then it really isn't a happy ending for any of the characters (at least those who survive). I really like the Predalien and the Predator. Both were cool characters in their own field. The Predalien leading its newest band of murderous aliens to dominate a poor mountain town while the Predator cleans up the mess as best he can. And the fights between the two were brief yet awesome! that was how it should be: one Predator against a hoard of aliens! And while the characters weren't that interesting, I liked them anyway because they remind me that you don't have to have some epic background to react to the terror before you. These are just everyday people living their lives when ugly monsters start killing off their friends and taking over the town. And the whole teenage-boy-loves-teenage-girl bit doesn't end happily - - but you'll just have to see the movie to know why.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
914,sacraptor,Simple things please simple people...,1,1 January 2008,"There seems to be a misunderstanding recently that large quantities of gore somehow translates into a quality film. Don't get me wrong I have full appreciation for gore. I play Mortal Kombat with the blood setting to maximum. And I too was turned off by the Pg-13 rating of Paul Anderson's take on the series. However, gore without the proper context gets old after a while, as did this film. Now apparently my dislike of this movie means that I'm not a true Alien/Predator fan according to some unique individuals. Because you know you can't have people out there with different opinions can you... that would lead to anarchy. The situation can be best summarized this way; ""simple things please simple people"". Sadly this franchise, and particularly the early Alien films have been anything but simple and there really isn't a reason why we should have to put up with such pathetic entries in this legacy. For example:Writing: Terrible. Some lines feel right our of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""... including poor titling.Characters: We are introduced to individuals seconds before their death. There is no attachment to them and the audience could really care less. And to those ""True"" fans out there, characterization is a really important part of the Alien and Predator films and is a little more important than your precious gore.Acting: Some of the worst I've ever seen. This is Uwe Boll level acting here.Plot: Nonexistent. Basically every great scene from the Alien and Predator films is taken, dumbed down, shortened and mashed into one film. The Ripley-Newt relationship is a perfect example. That motif was so well done in Aliens. In this film it was just painful to watch and was obviously tacked on by unimaginative and poor creators.Scares: None... you know who's going to live and die... especially if you saw the trailer which showed EVERY single death and plot point in the entire film.Innovation: None. Nothing we haven't seen before. FYI: The Predalien reproduction thing has been done before. This film just made some changes to the process. (see Alien directors cut)Camera Work: Pretty bad actually. There were some painful shots that just went on too long or just pulled the audience away from the experience... though in this case that's not such a bad thing.Effects: Pretty good. But coupled with poor camera work the Aliens had more of a guys in suits look. More so than the first two.SPOILER!!!Ending: Again this was revealed in the trailer, so you already know how the film is going to end. And for a film titled Aliens vs Predator, it probably would have been nice to see an actually winner. Say the Predator never came to ""help"". The military would have still nuked to place. Aliens would be gone. The only thing that would be different is that some of the survivors may not have made it. Of course it's also possible that there could have been more survivors. The Predator's inclusion seems rather pointless... as was this film.Overall: Awful... to think that the Alien series went from the Academy Awards to this. But apparently this is what the true fans wanted. So I suppose they're okay with Fox passing on James Cameron and Ridley Scott doing and Alien 5 and choosing to make these two excuses for films. Hopefully a lackluster performance from this film will scare those money grabbing executives out of continuing this facade. You ""True"" fans got what you wanted. A mindless, pointless, bloodbath. Now it's time to give the other fans what we want. The ones who maintain our objectivity. Either a new film, done the way it was meant to be and the way it captured our attention originally. Or just let it die before this gets even worse... if that's possible.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

But this movie is the worst 'action - horror' I've ever seen.The movie is way to dark, I was unable to detect any details on action parts. It seems the budget didn't reach high enough to develop real look-a-like explosions, the explosions felt like a 1985 movie.The only part which kept me watching for more then 51 minutes is that Jesse asked to go out swimming in the evening. After watching the nice blue-black outfit of the blond lady I tried to keep it running, and tried, but it became a really boring movie where you didn't see any detail.The storyline is not that bad actually, but the filming way makes it really unwatchable. The acting also sad. For example where some lady in the drain sees the dead bodies, she should be frightened. But she does a 'oeh' like how she should react when seeing a glass water falling of the table.

If the screenplay took more than 1 day to write, then the writer must have been a certified idiot.Anyone associated with this film (directors, screen writers, extras) should be injected with aliens' eggs so that the alien babies can burst through their stomachs.

If someone walks in to this movie expecting a monumental, ground breaking film then they will be sorely disappointed. On the other hand, if someone wants to kill about two hours in a fun, monster infested and gore filled way, then this movie is just for you! This film is what it is: a movie about two different species of aliens duking it out in a small, mid-western American city. And, of course, humans just get in the way. The movie has lots of death, both alien and human, some of which are pretty graphic (and cool). The plot and dialogue could probably be better, but they're just supplemental to the point of the movie...the point being to watch Predators battle Aliens.

Its easy to criticise someone who's being critical; people cry out, I bet you couldn't do any better! I bet I could !

921,nikolay-ershov,"An Alien movie set in Colorado, Earth, reluctantly involving a token Predator.",4,27 December 2007,"A disappointment, for a rather specific reason.The makers of this movie seem all excited about setting a pack of xenomorphs loose on a small Colorado town, in a kind of Alien 0 (or Alien -1) prequel even featuring a proto-Ripley character. Then, they reluctantly remember that the franchise requires them to have at least one Predator knocking about. And they only fulfil this barest minimum requirement, by putting in a Predator who is little more a cameo.Whatever is said about the first AvP, it did deliver on the promise of a premise involving humans caught up in a fight between two extraterrestial races. However feeble the result, it did have that interesting double-edged feel of being, simultaneously or alternately, a ""monster"" movie and a ""contact"" movie.

The character development was kind of pointless but, let's face it, you didn't come to see the people anyways now did you? I also liked how the movie picked up right where the last one left off, with the predators just killing off the aliens in the north pole and trying to get back to there home-world. I do wish they had spent a little more time on the predator home world, but maybe next time. In short, fans of the movie will enjoy this immensely and probably those who have never watched any of the other films will enjoy it also.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
923,gtracer12,Waste of time,1,9 January 2008,"This movie was a huge disappointment for me. I love alien and predator and have all of their movies. I thought the first AVP was okay but this takes the cake for the suck fest of my year.The action in the movie was pretty cool and there were some awesome deaths, like when that Jesse chick dies. But back to the movie. The acting was horrible, the special effects were horrible, the directing was horrible, the screams were horrible, the writing was horrible, the story was horrible, the set was horrible, the ending was horrible, the sound was horrible, the lighting was horrible, even my popcorn was horrible. The only thing that they should have put on the screen was the fight sequences. Which is the only reason I would see the movie again. What a waste of my time to see this movie. After seeing it I now know that I can't be any more disappointed. God please give me my money back.I did get a few laughs from the movie though like at the end when the helicopter is spiraling out of control and the gyro is spinning all over the place. Its a Bell 412 not an Extra. Also what was up with that military chick, she was like one of the soldiers in the Battlefield series of games, can use any weapon and can use any military vehicle. Wow! And that snobby little girl who was disappointed with a pair of cool night vision goggles, those things are sweet. That ignorant father of her's also ticks me off, ""There's no monster.""

924,claycon21,Lame,1,29 April 2008,"This movie was a grave insult to anyone who considers themselves fans of Alien or Predator & a complete waste of time for everyone else. I didn't catch it @ theaters because the lack of any popular acting talent made me a bit Leary. I ended up renting it thinking: ""Maybe they spent so much money on special effects & production, that they couldn't afford big name actors"" Boy was I wrong. With a worthless plot, terrible acting, & a lame script, stunning special effects couldn't have saved this movie if it had them - which it didn't. The special effects on the original Predator look better than the effects in this movie. So why did this movie have to suck so bad? Better still, why did it get made @ all? What were the producer & director thinking? I don't want to know, but they should be pimp-slapped because they totally dropped the ball. I doubt if they even know the meaning of the word: Requiem - probably just used it to sound cool. I'm serious. Given the budget I'm sure they had, I would think it would be pretty hard NOT to make a cool movie based on Aliens vs. Predator - even with no big actors. If they would have just stayed true to the material & thought out the plot a bit more it could have been a worthwhile project. Instead what we got was cheap, manufactured garbage. Zero plot depth, zero character development, flaky special effects, I could go on & on & on (but I won't). Basically what was done here was using the popularity of a franchise to market a B movie. I'm sure there are cheaper, easier ways to get a B movie made without exploiting a franchise. Most of the movie is too dark to see many details. I'm sure they hoped by keeping a relatively low light balance they could hide the inadequacy of the effects. Again, they were wrong. There is nothing that I can say in this movie's favor. It has no redeeming value of any kind. Boring. Plot less. Anticlimactic. Pointless. It served only to insult my intelligence. If you haven't seen this movie, don't waste your time. & if you know anyone involved in the production of this movie, slap them for me.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

All I can say is ""WHAT A FREAKIN' DISAPPOINTMENT"" I imagined it would have more Predators in the film and more good action fighting scenes. To have a alien and predator as one mutated monster, you'd think they'd come up with some pretty awesome fighting scenes or extra powers or something. I would not recommend this movie at all.

I don't think so... I think they simply used it because they thought it sounded cool... And that my friends is how you can judge AVP2. A film made to be cool without much thought (if any) put into the direction.Heck it even does away with the prime element that were in both franchises~ 'stalk and kill'.

927,Tyler_Tarkington,I thought it was okay. JUST OKAY!!!,6,27 December 2007,"First things first, everybody knows and can predict that this film is better than the first one in many ways. First, the action scenes are so much better and done more professionally than the first one (the first one was so amateuristic with the camera angles and the editing) but there is still some camera and editing problems featured in here. It's just that the action is more intense and up close to the characters around the movie but i have to admit that the characters are so forgettable and careless because of the horrid dialogue and acting, much worse than in the first one. The plot is i have to say respectable because it deals with a major jeopardy situation within the people of Gunnison and how the predator/alien critters running around affect the situation but in a cheesy kind of a horror tone like way. I have to say that this movie is too much into the horror and gore than the story/plot because it is respectable but weak but because of the way too short running time, even though it is the same as the first one (89 mins without credits; avp, 89 mins without credits;AVP requiem). Plus the film was way too dark and edited too shabby and rigid. However the cinematography and the score of the film was good, it brought some exciting visceral and gritty feeling and elements to the film. The editing, the script and definitely the acting was weak but the action in a horror sense was good. It's just that the other alien/predator films are bigger budgeted and had better stories and acting plus they were much more serious. This one was just straight into mindless horror and gore in a clichéd sort of way with other horror films. It was just as if they were making an 80's low budget horror films and placing aliens and predators there in the scene. And another thing, there was a scene in the trailers that got cut (it was when the Reiko Alleysworth character shooting the jeep machine gun at the aliens, this was probably one of the scenes that got out of the 10 minutes that was cut from the film; the directors Strause said) which was a let down because there was a plot hole when this was cut, a sub plot taken out. Plus there is not even a true moment of the aliens and predator fighting, it was just a bunch of one minute action scenes of them fighting. Most of the action scenes was just low budget scenes of running around and getting killed by the aliens/predators. The film payed way too much attention on the human side which kind of a let down because since the budget was too low, they couldn't show more exciting, more long battle sequences but just instead show a bunch of humans running, I mean WTF! But I have to admit, that the last action scene with the predator/aliens/predator hybrid fighting was short but awesome which outdid the rest and was the most exciting most action packed scene. Overall, this film was okay but it's stupidity just kind of ruined the integrity of this film and it is definitely not as good or as exciting as the old alien and predator films but definitely an hour and a half's worth of a good time and it is obviously better than the first one (the first one was just awful and rubbish). But I probably won't see this film again or probably only one more time. I just can't fully respect it. For those who said this film is so horrible and worse than the first one are either on crack or those who don't appreciate simplicity within action movies. It's dumb but not awful, it's respectable as an alien/predator action film but nothing more, yes the bad acting and weak script/plot ruins the film but not in the way that the first one did. This is just basically a one step up in just action from the first movie, it is just as bad as the first one with script, editing and acting, heck maybe worse but there is definitely better action and gore and we do see more of a profound battle of the aliens and predators but in a lower and a kind of a disappointing extent. This film could have been so much more but done more successfully than in the first one. This film does make the fans just a little more happier but in just for the action extent, so in a one step extent. Next time i hope fox realizes that they need more experienced actors, script writers and directors to make the next one a bit better than this. Next time actually get one more step ahead for within acting and in script/plot. I already know that fox is planned for a third aliens vs predator but i think the studio knows that next time, stay away from filmmakers who aren't experieced enough even if they are accurate and true fans of the alien and predator franchise. It's just not that they don't know about the franchise, it's just they suck to what it comes to make a smart, effort full film because obviously this one wasn't.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
928,reactor202,I wasn't closely as bas as avp.,8,3 February 2008,"THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS This was actually way much better than the changing labyrinth of avp1. I liked some references to original movies, like the thing predator used to scan earth from predator home world(?) was the same thing in alien-movie where the crew found this humanoid body with hole in it's chest from the same ""scanner"". AVPR suggests that to be predator body. Also I liked that predator stripped it's gear in final battle with predalien, like in first predator movie in the final fight with the governor. Biggest minuses comes from slight over darkness of general picture in order to make effects look more real. In few scenes alien looked like bunch of hoes and gutter. Also the teen drama imported from conventional horror splatter movies kinda spoiled the ALIEN or PREDATOR feeling of the movie. And it should have had action like in starship troopers and the waiting thrill of alien series. Action was too forward or too messy. Like the national guard scene was just sloppy camera-work with screams and gutter. There could have been waves of aliens protruding from alleys and roofs with GI:s pounding em' with 50 cal MG:s. I have always hoped that alien 5 could bring aliens to future earth running in the streets of some big city, while armed forces tries to block streets and shoot out all alien lifeforms. In the end though.. this was improvement to avp series. I actually hope there will be more of this.. lets just give some other directors chance because change isn't always bad thing.

929,alrvd420,OK maybe not the best film ever but still great fun and better than AVP1,10,20 January 2008,"Well having just come back from seeing AVP2 with a couple of mates I find myself with mixed feelings regarding my opinion. Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed it but I think that is more because I turned up at the cinema not really expecting to see an amazingly written and well-paced story. All I expected was a good 'popcorn' movie showing my favourite sci-fi movie character (Predator) versus my scariest sci-fi movie characters as a child (Aliens), and that is exactly what I got.I think that is the difference most of the people leaving comments on this film either have asked themselves already or more importantly still have to ask themselves. Most people wanting to go watch this film are more likely than not going with no higher expectation other than to see some cool killings and some nice CGI. It's the same with any film where you bring two major characters (and therefore two major franchises together), see Freddy vs Jason, for example. It's for that very reason you see, by default, such rubbish acting from numerous obscure actors/actresses. That is not coincidence! Onto the 'popcorn' parts of the movie, I loved the snippets of what seemed to be the Predator home-world and the plentiful use of old and new weapons alike by the Predator. Some of the actions/sick impregnations by the Aliens (esp. the kid and pregnant woman) also shocked a little to help remind you how animalistic the creatures are! Fair enough there may have been some pretty big plot holes and a shallow plot in the first place but then you just remind yourself of why you're watching the film in the first place.

930,Halo_X,Great Addition to the Alien/Predator Sagas,10,29 December 2007,"I myself liked this movie very much. I felt it reestablished some of the Horror of the alien and the ferocity of the Predator. The only qualms I had with the picture were that it was too (visually) dark at times and hard to make out what was going on on the screen, and that the plot was pretty thin (though, if your going to see a movie titled AVP do you REALLY expect amazing plot?). All in all it was a very enjoyable movie experience. I don't see why it is getting all this negative feedback. The only logical reason I can think of is that people went into it with impossible expectations. No movie will ever make you feel the same way you did when you saw Aliens for the first time.

932,burton-28,Don't Waste 86 Minutes of Your Life,1,25 December 2007,"This was the worst movie I have seen in 10 years. Period.It was so bad that I got an account on this site for the sole purpose of telling you how bad it was.If my wife hadn't been with me, I would have walked out after the first 30 minutes. The best part of this movie was its use of the nostalgic Predator noises and rhythms from Predator and Predator 2. The Problems:1. The movie violated some rather substantial laws of physics as a convenient short cut to further the convoluted plot of the predator ""covering up"" the evidence of the aliens. I can just hear the writers saying ""We'll just make up some sort of an advanced technology thingy. The audience is too stupid to know or care."" 2. The aforementioned cover up is completely in contradiction to what we have been taught about the predators in previous movies, books, graphic novels, etc... The predators have never cared who knows about them. Yet, in this steaming cow patty of a movie, the chief alien runs around like some sort of interstellar CIA agent, making some corpses disappear, while leaving 100s of others. 3. All 4 Alien movies have been moving towards a quicker gestation period for the aliens, but it has now been reduced to a matter of minutes. Furthermore, the absence or presence of a queen having always been a key issue towards containment has now been bypassed by allowing the predator alien to make pregnant humans give birth instantly to more aliens. Again I can hear the writers... ""hee hee hee, nobody ever remembers what happened in the last movie, just have the women give birth to aliens,.. Yeah, that't the ticket!"" 4. Separately from that, we have been taught in 5 prior alien movies that aliens do NOT take on the characteristics of their host. Apparently, lacking any actual writing skills, the hacks that made this movie decided to just ""abracadabra!"" and make the big bad villain this time be a alien/predator mutant. Apparently this another detail we were supposed to just ignore in favor of all of the other mind numbing things distracting us. 5. It was impossible to care about ANY of the characters in this movie. To say that they were two dimensional would be to add a dimension to their characters. I couldn't even work myself up to hating anyone. Blaahhhh.6. The violence wasn't even Friday the 13th gratuitous. It was just in-your-face obnoxious. Okay, we get it. You are willing to kill children and pregnant women using in-camera gory shots. Sorry, but that doesn't add anything to the movie except an ""R"" rating.I could go on and on. I guarantee the reason you didn't see a single ""name"" in this movie is that anybody who wasn't desperate for the work took one look at the script and decided they would rather do laundry soap commercials. Bottom line - Not even worth a free rental.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
933,xlgraphicspro,Better than I expected.,8,26 December 2007,"I grew up hooked on the Alien/Predator movies. I even owned almost every copy of the Alien VS. Predator comic book series by DarkHorse. To give you a better sense of why I rated this movie the way I did I'll list all the movies from all 3 franchises from best to worst.1. Alien 2. Aliens 3.Predator 4. Alien VS. Predator Requiem 5. Alien3 6. Predator2 7. Alien Resurrection 8. AVP If you don't agree with me then don't read the rest. But if you do then read on. Also, If you want to get technical, I think that AVPR and Alien3 are neck and neck for 4th place on the all time list.OK, how about I get on with the review? I expected very little from this film, especially after Paul W.S. Andersons Abortion he called AVP. I'm also having a hard time believing any of the previous reviews by people saying that AVP was a better film. I spent all of my Christmas eve Puking my guts out because of the flu, I thought I was over it till I read some of those reviews praising AVP and I almost lost my Lunch again! I will admit that AVPR kept me entertained throughout, but one thing bugged me before I even saw the movie. Just the simple fact that it took place in the Present, that was also one of the many things that made me hate AVP. Mainly because it nullifys what the first 2 alien movies established. Basically it said that the Alien creatures have never been encountered before until It ran into Ripleys crew, which was way in the future from now . //Warning Sarcasm Ahead// "" Oh, except for that one time In Antartica, oh and also that little skirmish in Gunnison Colorado."" Since I already was aware of this detail before I saw the movie, I was able to look past it and judge this movie for what it was. A simple knock down drag out war between two of Hollywoods greatest movie creations ever! The acting was OK, I don't go to this kind of movie and expect Oscar caliber acting. Finally the last thing that bugged me was that the Movie trailers gave away a lot of the action, and made what would have been a surprising turn of events, predictable. I also know that if I didn't see any trailers for this movie, that I would have maybe given it one more star. I don't want to give any more of the movie away, but the trailers already did. In the end, I loved all the action scenes, and the addition of the Predator technology was cool. It satisfied my need for movie violence. Last but not least, I liked how the predator didn't team up with any humans like in AVP. It makes sense, If you get in the way, your probably going to end up dead. I suggest you go and see, and avoid the trailers!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
934,waxon1123,Just Pure Awful,1,26 December 2007,"If you like cheesy one liners and bad acting go see this movie. Every hardcore Alien or Predator fan should be thoroughly angry with this movie. I almost walked out after 20 minutes. I think I might attend the casting call for the sequel because I think I could do a better job than most of these actors. The characters in the movie aren't formally introduced, and when you finally find one to relate to, they die. Towards the end of the movie before they get on the helicopter, they say that only kate can fly the helicopter. The whole time during this scene I find myself asking who kate is and why she knows how to fly a helicopter. During action scenes there is a cut every three seconds which not only annoys the viewer, but it made me dizzy and sick to my stomach.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
935,ericdrayvyn,tis the season to be gory - as all 6 original movies prepared us for,8,26 December 2007,"What a glorious Christmas with this sci-fi spectacle. I only forgave the first AVP because of the fights between the species; every human (even poor spudboy) was disposable in it. Here the humans are only slightly better off - but the fights are BADASS!!!!! Much like Transformers on the 4th of July (also where I spent that holiday), the small shortcomings/dark combat moments are glossed over with the effect of the whole. You don't go to these types of movies for the people anyway! Who cared about Spike from the old Transformers cartoon??This AVP pulls no punches, I dare anyone to wager who lives through this movie & succeed 100%. A particularly nice thing was references to/moments like the original films of each series. They really put some thought into this one; there was a cleverness that has not been seen in 20 years (Aliens & the 1st Predator). They catch you off guard a few times.Hats off. It is unapologetically violent: don't take your kids. Definitely go, though. This merits a big screen viewing, and deserves opening week support. The entirety of these movies has been swept under the rug after the 1st Alien - so give this one some attention. I'm not saying awards, I'm saying true audience/fan enjoyment. Do disregard any Ripley comparisons... NO ONE can touch Sigourney Weaver (try as they & their marketing crew may). just GO!!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Story or VIOLENCE?,10,26 December 2007,"Ill answer my own question/summary with this: VIOLENCE and GORE. full-stop AVP:R hit the nail on the head with this fantastically orchestrated piece of art. The opening was sheer brilliance, i loved looking inside the ship and life of these Predators because we have not seen this in any of the films.The characters are kind of lame but if they aren't brought into the film as soldiers what can you do? Nothing. Just watch them die at the hands of these alien killing machines.The scenes on which each alien/human interaction is shot is awesome, i loved the underground stuff and the above ground action scenes are just as good! This is made possible by the most seamless use of 3D graphics tied into the real-life filming.To conclude, this movie rocks. It incorporates every aspect of the Alien & Predator franchise, as well as introducing many new techniques during action scenes. The action is 100% gut wrenchingly sick and AWESOME.I truly recommend this film to any fans.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
937,rodthejedi22,Horribly done!,3,26 December 2007,"I went to see the film yesterday with my 11 yr old and we both agreed the film was horrible. There were many scenes where battles between the Predator and aliens you just could not make out what was happening. The human characters were not developed. There was not one you could connect with to make you care. The film lacked any real depth as far as storytelling is concerned.When there was action, it was good, but again it was hard to see in many places to fully enjoy and appreciate. I really liked the Predator and he did remind me of the Predator from the original Predator film.Here are my real problems with this film: 1. Too short! I think this contributed to the lack of character development and lack of real story depth. For such a short film, the beginning dragged.2. The Predalien! Please explain how this alien obtained the characteristics of a Predator. This was not consistent with other alien films. And if you were to create him, explain how he came to be and please show more him/her/it 3. Only 1 Predator and his mission: Only one Predator is sent and that is even questionable because I got the feeling he decided this mission of his own accord. Then he goes around cleaning up the mess and taking on all these aliens by himself. There should have been more predators for such a task.4. Where did all the aliens come from and no alien mother to speak of: You see all these many aliens, but it is unsupported in the film as to how so many could be given what we saw on the ship that crashed. We discover that the Predalien is a mother and makes her babies from human babies. It was not clear if they were Predalien babies.5. Disappointed with the ending and somewhat did not understand what the point was with the military going into this room with the lady you had seen prior in the movie and discussing the Predator weapon. Does this indicate another film?! I could go on, but I personally did not think this Predator vs Alien was much better than the first one. My comment to my son was, ""They just cannot seem to get this right""! My son said ""Maybe it was just supposed to be a game"". I said to him, ""I think you are right"" I think at this point maybe doing Predator vs Alien was a high and lofty dream that should have never come to the big screen and should have just remained as dream and vision in fans of the franchises minds.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
938,badbishopk,"Slow, un-suspenseful plot, dark and devoid of clear character imagery",5,26 December 2007,Please do not waste your money or time going to the theater for this movie. I love Sci-fi and am an avid enthusiast of the Alien and Predator franchise movies. AVP released in 2004 was quite excellent especially in terms of keeping me riveted to the screen. AVPR overall as a movie sucks and beings the plot very very slow. The entire movie is very dark which is not a big surprise but the characters are very hard to perceive which flips your head as you try to figure out what is happening. The scenes are choppy and has quite a few disconnects. I don't want to waste any more of your time as much as mine so I will end here by just saying wait till it hits the dollar theaters so that you can kill a boring afternoon where if you do fall asleep consider it a benefit.,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

And what producer thought ""these guys can do music videos, so I bet they would be good at action."" WRONG! The characters were pointless, the action was gory, but flat, the suspense was non-existent, and they couldn't even get simple details right. Like the single M-16 clip that must have held 500 rounds! Oh, since when do enlisted army soldiers know how to fly helicopters? And since when do they get to carry night vision equipment home for the weekend for their daughter to play with? And what was the point of the night vision equipment? Don't introduce an interesting element into a movie and then ignore it! I own all of the original Alien movies and I still jump in scenes from the first two movies, but I could have fallen asleep in this film if it wasn't for the large Coke I was drinking.It seemed like they were introducing characters just to have them killed five minutes later.It really is sad. Another multi-million dollar flick with less directing, writing, and acting skill than a group of high school kids doing their own movie.If you want to see some good sci-fi, go rent Aliens, or Bladerunner, but don't waste your time on this.enjoy the movies!

940,sskea1,"average movie, good fan movie",6,26 December 2007,"*Contains minor spoiler* to sum up this movie in one sentence: the alien spawned in the predator at the end of the movie downs the ship that this predator was on, following which a single predator from their home planet is sent to clean up the mess.What then follows is a series of average acted senses where we get to know the humans involved in the story a little better. For the first half of the movie the lone predator is tracking down the escaped alien (in morphed predator form, which is also a queen), as well as further aliens that spawned from the ship's crash. While this is happening we meet the humans that are soon to be involved in the story.Despite the fact that this movie's creditability as a legitimate film is ruined by the poor acting as a fan movie it plays out rather well. We get to see some cool new predator weaponry as well as old favourites used to their full advantage. Oppositionally the aliens are vast in numbers and the new queen, in predator morph, is a formidable opponent for the lone ranger.As the second half of the film plays out with many deaths, humans and alien, its basically a slaughter fest for the second. To sit back and watch this movie as a film you will be quite disappointed as the acting lacks greatly. The ""special effects"" are what you will pay for and for this it's probably worth the money to get a seat.The movie ends abruptly and very disappointingly, there is unfortunately no obviously lead to a sequel like the last but the story does coincide with the alien movies, as the humans will never know what happened.One wonders whether this was made for the fan or the money as the great acting that made each of the franchise films has disappeared for the brilliant graphic effects the original films never had technology to present. Why not rid us of all story line involving humans and just have the predators hunt aliens, on a new world with them spawning from dinosaurs or large bears/lions/tiger.

But after these short 85 minutes... i was sitting there and was thinking ""WTF, is that all?"" Oh man i was VERY very disappointed.The Movie was damn dark, really! The animations were mostly way too fast, so we have to wait for the HD-DVD or whatever to see all the stuff in slow-mo :/ Oh yeah and 1 Predator vs everyone.. very disappointing! Its OK to watch it once, but hell, i wont buy the DVD! Never! My mate with me was also disappointed and said he couldn't wait for part III cause the ending left some unanswered questions..

Ever since I watched Schwarzenegger in the first Predator and Weaver in the first Alien I was hooked. I have been very excited to see this movie and last night I finally watched it. I must say that in my opinion this is the first Alien/Predator movie that deserves a ""B"" rating. This Alien vs. Predator movie does for the series what Batman & Robin and Batman Forever did for the 1989 Batman. This movie was all gore and lacked any intensity and suspense. It was all visual and did not get inside my head or make my heart pump any faster. Nor did I find myself terrified for the characters. I plan on waiting for the next AVP to come out on DVD before watching it. At least then I will have only spent $3.50 to watch it. I give this movie a 6 out of 10 stars.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
943,Chile0,Absolute Garbage!,1,27 December 2007,"Context: I haven't seen AVP 1, nor anything else besides 'Arnie's' Predator. Therefore, this movie appealed to me because I wanted to see a good movie, and be entertained during my holiday. This mentality represents the majority of people who would have gone to see this movie.So I will start with (1)It seems that the majority of the 'people' giving positive comments about the movie on this site have something to do with the movie - I laughed when I read their comments because they sound more like they are promoting their own movie.(2) The producers/directors are obviously educated, but honestly, what creativity is there in saying ""um, duh, let's end the movie by dropping a nuke and destroying everything!"" A five year old could have come up with a better ending.(3) My IQ is now probably much lower than it was before I watched the movie, here are some quotes that explain why: - ""but the government never lies to people"" (I can't believe people actually laughed at this) - ""are the monsters gone?"" ""Yes, they are""( how they hell would you know you fool!!)(4) Why do they make the government seem even more evil then the aliens that kill for fun? Are the producers leading a personal crusade against democracy?(5) Cliché, clichés and even more clichés.(6) I have never turned away from a movie, but I had to during the hospital scenes - for goodness the trailer compared to the movie was like buying a can of coca-cola only for sewerage water to come out of the can when you're drinking it. I thought it was a scene out of Hostel or some other brainless gore+violent movie. I have no problem with those movies (I never watch them) because you know what to expect.

With this being said, the humans act as ancillary characters so that there is some dialogue for the audience to follow. The deaths and action are pretty good but yes the plot is predictable for the most part. Definitely better than the first avp movie. I really liked that the directors stepped up the violence since it is what any fan of the franchises is expecting to see. The only part of the movie that disappointed me was that it seemed to short.

We go for the action, the special effects, and to see two of our favorite ETs fight to the death, and in that AVPr delivers.I particularly liked how this movie showed, albeit briefly, the predators' home world as well as more of their technology and weapons. Although I'm not a big fan of the aliens, this movie really does a good job of demonstrating just how resilient and dangerous a species they are.If you go into this movie with the right expectations you're bound to enjoy it.

951,cappsag,Worst Movie I've seen in awhile!,1,27 December 2007,"Let me start by saying, I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I'm a big fan of the whole series and when I heard this movie was going to be like Aliens 3 should have been, set on Earth, I was very excited. That being said, The Brothers Strause whiffed big time on this one. Not only did they turn a great series into some sort of paranoid propaganda piece, but also with as much experience as the Strause Brothers have had in visual effects, I fully expected them to re-write the wrongs left by the first movie. This was not the case. From the very start, this movie set the tone for the crap sandwich that would follow. It was like sitting through a collegiate film fest. Furthermore, the ""actors"" were high school at best in their abilities and provided zero depth to the story. The men in this movie were pathetic. They didn't even know where the guns were in the gun store. The writing was amateur at best, it just amazes me with two of the greatest monsters ever conceived for cinema how little a writer could utilize their potential. Furthermore, this movie and it's predecessor took a dump on the original Predator. Predator was awesome cause the Predator was a super-hunter, taking out our best of the best with ease. In this treat, he can't ever seem to avoid the dreaded ""tailswipe"" by the aliens. In almost every scene the Predator is in, he gets knocked down by the Aliens. It's like they've never seen this scourge before. Makes no sense. If they are that bad of hunters, why not send two? The only reference this movie made to it's originals was a cheesy ""Get to the Chopper"" line, which made fun of the original rather than honoring it. There are other things that make no sense, like how the national guard was getting killed left and right yet this Ripley-like woman was gunning them down, never even pausing to reload. The cop had all of ten lines even though he was in every scene practically. Most of his moments on the screen were spent making confused looks and not doing a damn thing. It was like this movie was made by left-wing feminists. Good Job Brothers Strause...or how about the Strause Brothers, either way you're crappy directing/movie sucked 6 bucks from my pocket.

That was not the case, however, as the dialogue wasn't half bad, and quite believable, in fact. (My opinion of course, but that's just how I feel.) Sure, the characters weren't exactly memorable, but they were mainly there to get killed off anyways. And besides, I didn't pay $8.00 to see an Oscar-worthy drama, I wanted to see aliens and a predator fighting (hence the name AVP), which is what we got. The plot was a bit rushed as with the story, and the scenes were pretty dark, too.

This is pretty much an AvP movie turned high school slasher. Nothing more than that. Action sequence was hardly anything enjoyable. It was very dark and the camera pans fast and switches to 'predator view' a lot. If anything, you'll probably laugh at how poorly this movie was executed and some smart-alec lines about our government. It was as if the writers said 'hey lets insert how we feel about our government so we can look cool'.

I saw a 7 out of 10 rating on my iphone as I headed to the theaters and figured it would be great.... what a waste of money! I should have read the comments too. I think the studio paid some folks to rate this thing high on IMDb. I can't see this anything higher than a 2 star. I wouldn't even rent this movie for 0.99.

956,mrforestranger,This movie is a waste of time and money!,1,28 December 2007,"My qualifications for this review? I own all the Alien and Predator movies & I have and have read almost all the books I can find that are related to this series.I can safely say, this movie is a Stinker. Save your money & don't waste your time. If you like mindless action, mindless gore, no plot to speak of & like being taken by Hollywood, see the movie.If you are a serious Alien series fan, send a message to the over stuffed, over paid suits in Hollywood & 20th Century Fox & don't give them a penny.This movie has so many plot holes in it you could sieve pasta through it. Read the other negative reviews to get the big picture, it has all be said accurately, so I don't have to repeat them.The characters in this movie are cardboard. You want them all dead. And, the movie doesn't disappoint, almost all of them die. Even the hot, bubble headed blond. Do you feel sorry for her? Nope. No plot, no character development....who cares. The Predators are now idiots too. They scan everything but their own dead warrior. They are suppose to be a high technology society, right? In the Predator movie, they scanned the soldiers and the girl to determine who was armed. Trophy kills. In AvP, they scanned Charles Weyland and let him go because he had Cancer. Major Plot hole!Also, the R rating is because they have kids in the movie that get a face hugger, lots of gore and violence and there is one hospital scene where a very large pregnant women is injected with chest bursters. She is implanted by the Hybrid Alien with 4 or 5 eggs in a mouth-to-mouth love scene-orgy and they all hatch in, say, 30 seconds. Sensational gore a plenty, nothing more. These scenes are laughable, not serious. It is almost like the violence happens and the Alien looks at the camera and waits for applause, a thumbs up or a nod of some sort.The Aliens in this movie are all on performance enhancing drugs. They develop fast and spread quickly all over the town, tons of them, everywhere in record spawn time. Pathetic because it does not stick to the series story line and adds nothing to the Aliens, Aliens Predator continuity.I have noticed the positive reviews are written by people who love the gore. Laughable. As a movie, as a continuation of the Aliens franchise and the development of the Aliens vs Predator franchise, this movie is a cheesecake cliché at best. If you have faithfully followed this series, all the rules are broken and the Aliens and Predators are reduced to comic book characters.There is not one fantastic, memorable action scene. There are almost no special effects worth remembering. There are no brand name actors. The plot is as thin as onion paper that ultimately ends with a, ""We have two choices to get out of this mess...The Hospital or the center of town!"". I just about wet myself. The center of town means everyone is going to get nuked by Big Brother who somehow knows the town has been infested because they have an AWAC in the air that can see the infestation on a radar screen in special effects Red Spots. I just about fell out of my chair. Special effects red spot alien radar on an AWAC over middle America. I am splitting my gut laughing.Having to get to the Helicopter Pad made me choke on my popcorn. Has anyone played a game called ZOMBIES!? You have to get your playing pieces to the Helicopter Pad to win. I almost wet myself laughing.The ending is enough to make you shake your head in wonderment. Who did 20th Century Fox hire to write this script!? OH, OH, ask me.... a Grade 5 student. There really can't be any other answer. Oh, yes there can be another answer... Low Budget Cheesecake Sci-Fi.The ending? ""Col. Stevens takes the Predator pulse rifle to Ms. Yutani (Francoise Yip). She tells him that the earth is not ready for the technology it represents. Col. Stevens knows Yutani doesn't want the technology to use on earth."" You are kidding me, right? Ms. Yutani? Who is Ms Yutani? (forshadow:Weyland-Yutani: The Corporation) She is in the movie exactly 2 seconds and yet, in her infinite far east wisdom, she says the world is not ready for the technology. Seriously??!! The Brothers Dweebs (Strause) as directors? Who is responsible for this hemorrhage-abortion of a movie? They are the Doug and Bob McKenzie of directors and yet Fox entrusted the flailing Alien franchise to them. They are touted as special effects experts and yet the movie is all low budget special effects. Hmmm, I see a pattern. Laughable.This movie is only made to empty your wallet. It serves no other purpose. It has no plot. It has no main characters worth mentioning. It is disjointed. It does not adhere to any of the character principles established in previous movies. It does nothing to advance the franchise. The special effects are lame, minimal and low budget. And, it has no ending to speak of. It is low budget and strictly designed to take your hard earned money. Nothing more.Save your money. Either watch it on TV where it will very quickly end up. Buy a bootleg or miss this bleeding ulcer altogether. There is a reason why Fox did not Preview this movie to the critics. The critics would have eaten this mess alive and no one would have gone to the theaters to see it. JR Giger, the original creator, is at this very moment, leaning over a toilet spilling his lunch.20th Century Fox, this movie is a stinker. It is as bad or worse than Alien 3. You insult us.

957,TruthWarriorX,Horrible Movie Loved by Mindless Fanboys (for some twisted reason),1,28 December 2007,"It seems anyone who loves this movie only enjoyed it for the gore-fest it was. That and there was Aliens and a Predator in it. Not even deserving of a B movie I would call it an F movie, because it failed in some many ways. The acting was horrible, even for a horror movie, which is sad. There was no good or memorable lines, just basic bland blah. Oddly the entire town was evacuated by a paranoid and useless sheriff after 3 people were found dead. Then he calls the national guard was called in when the power went out. This was all before he finds that aliens were the culprits.The directors seemed to take great enjoyment in trying to shock people by killing children, unborn and otherwise, off in most gruesome ways. This movie only appeals to those who love gore & violence for gore's sake which is not even shown much due to bad lighting and too-fast editing. A horrible movie that is in no way as good as the original Predator or Alien movies.I do think most fan boys are actually boys. In the theater I saw many parents bring their 10 year old (and less!) children to see other children getting their chests ripped open.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
958,sheishien,garbage movie for a fan but good time killer,4,28 December 2007,"It was just a movie to kill time. Been a fan of predator and alien series, but wow AVP and AVPR really really sucked. I really don't know how these directors can ruin something so badly (from the perspective of comics).Wouldn't it just be easier to take one of those AVP comics and adapt it to the big screens? At least it wont suck as bad possibly... But comparing AVP and AVPR, I have to say AVP was a bit better than Requiem.. the sequel lacked substances in all aspects.. Feels like the directors are taking bits and pieces that think the audiences wants to see and put it all together into a movie without considering if anything made sense.As a fan, AVP provided more story and at least 3 predators with different personalities and all that crap that a fan likes.. but AVPR sorta gave us one super badass, ninja kung-fu predator that was just garbage..The flaws and loopholes pointed out by many users made a lot of sense, but in the same time, it is maybe difficult for everyone to understand because the movie is probably made for the general audience and not fanatics.. nothing was connecting with the movie .. just a lot of silly acting and gore.. even the predator and alien movements seems to be flawed..I guess I had some questions: the predator from AVP infested with the apparent ""hybrid"" was struck in the gut by the alien queen, and died.. Won't that kill the drone inside the predator as well? then we see the mothership where the dead predator lies and all that .. all of a sudden, we see a smaller ship where the hybrid killed a couple predators .. what the hell happened in between? the nuke used to destroy the fallen ship was also kinda of weak compared to other predator movies .. (maybe it comes with power settings now?) hell i don't know.. but lame~ just seems like a lot of aliens popped out of nowhere.. im not worrying about the gestation periods.. but i didn't see that many face huggers nor humans getting hugged ..the ending sequence with ms. utani also hints a part 3 or are they trying to tie the story with alien series? if so, the weapons they used in alien series sucked (assuming they used predator technology).. sorta mismatch like star wars vs star wars prequels.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Were i like in KC MO the kc star gave it one star evidently he never was a fan of any of the movies, other wise he would have realized that it was made by the fans for the fans.....

I hope someone gets fired for thinking that it is acceptable for this line to be crossed.As the movie started, I was almost in horror knowing what was going to happen to the father son bonding moment. I thought that was in poor taste, but the scene in the maternity ward crossed all limits. Watching all the babies knowing that they were going to die, and the mother about to give birth. The way they used it to show how the aliens could rapidly multiply in a pregnant women was unnecessary. I left the movie after wasting 90 min of my Christmas day wanting my money back.i hope that some exec. hears us and actually makes a good movie that we all can enjoy. maybe we will reward them by helping them gross more then 10 million for the opening week.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

It makes us feel that the entire year was wasted with bad movies having being released in the wrong time.This is not just a disgrace to the previous AVP, which was blended so well and viewers did not even have to know the Aliens or Predators prequel story lines. But this movie is disgrace to all the past movies that were taken like aliens, predators and the blending AVP.If you ask me for my real review. I wasted money + time and more than that this movie gives you a bad sensation to even watch any other movies after it.

962,shashankgupta3,An action-packed spectacle of fun,10,30 December 2007,"All I can say is my friends and I thought this movie was sweet. People can go on and on about the lackluster acting in the slow beginning or the fact that this movie could have had a deeper storyline with more comedy mixed in, but I think the producers did an awesome job with something very simple: aliens led by a Predalien infesting a city and one lone veteran Predator who attempts to kill them all or die trying.The action scenes are fantastic, there's always one moment in each scene that left me in awe, sorta like a ""can he even DO that?"" kinda feeling. It's not really scary because you know that most of the humans and aliens are gonna die hands down, but how they die is what makes every second interesting.The aliens are as violent and raptor like as ever. They move in packs and kill stuff. Totally simple. The predalien, their leader, shows some signs of intelligence though and he is sort of the equivalent of the main predator of AVPR.The main predator, ""Wolf"" is really amazing. At one point, he actually dangles a human by his ankle using some rope and uses him as bait to attract the aliens to him (for some reason the aliens seem to always go for the defenseless prey). When the aliens come they didn't even get to touch the guy, the predator's ready to destroy them. My point is that the predator is very much like the modern human because he's very intelligent, but he's also like a Greek spartan because you can never deny that he's not 100 percent manly warrior. Couple that with his huge arsenal of weapons (I think he uses like 6 weapons total) and you have some pretty intense fights. I like how the predator doesn't show compassion towards humans in this movie like what happened in AVP. He ends up saving a ton of them but that's only a side effect of him doing whatever he could to kill the aliens. It seems like the aliens kill just for fun, but the predator actually knows what he's doing.This movie isn't really funny, the only funny part I can remember is when a woman says, ""What do you mean? The government doesn't LIE to people!"" or something along those lines, it's OK though, not all movies need the jokes, but it would've helped.As for the human characters, all I can say is I didn't care much what happened to them, and it wasn't just because of their bad acting and lack of humor. There's so much merciless death in this film that you just stop caring, and that's good because if you care, then you shouldn't watch this movie, you'll walk out horrified. Nobody is spared....well, for the most part....I give this movie a 10/10 for excellent, not for perfect. It could've had more stuff but overall it was an excellent movie, good job strause brothers.I have to say that the ending is actually very satisfying unlike most movies which are good but then sorta blow it at the ending (I am Legend), let's just say that there probably will be a sequel and I can't wait to see it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
963,dupa_hole,An absolute insult to the previous movies,2,30 December 2007,"Basically, its a couple random clips on a very loose storyline. I mean seriosuly, one second something is happening the next something else. You get lost very early in the movie, ruining the rest of the movie. If you like aliens mindlessly killing each other for eighty-six minutes, this is the movie for you. Otherwise, your better off seeing another movie.SPOILERS STARTING NOW!!!!!!! For example, towards the beginning when the predator first comes to earth, he locates a crash landed ship from his planet. He moves some bottles presses some buttons,with no clear explanation or reason, and so your just sitting there thinking to yourself ""What the hell is going on?""

964,jessi-38,I loved it. Much better than the 1st AVP,10,1 January 2008,"In my opinion, this movie was able to keep the feel of both the original Alien movie and the Predator movie. It was scary, disturbing but somewhat believable too. Hard to describe without spoilers. Long story short. If you enjoyed Alien movies and predator movies. You should like this movie much better than the last one. I was so, disappointed in the 1st AVP so the only reason I went to see this was because my son wanted to see it. I was happily surprised. The only thing though that bothered me was that before in scary movies (even if this doesn't fall under the category of scary) they left out children and pregnant women. This isn't the case in this movie. If this would be something that would disturb you - this may not be the movie for you. Logistics part though - if you think about this on a species level... a species looking to take over wouldn't hesitate for a child or mother-to-be. All together... a great movie.

965,MovieQuoter,"unfortunately this is a ""fanchise"" killer",1,1 January 2008,"If you are a fan of either of the two origin franchises (Aliens & Predator...duh...and even if you liked or disliked AVP flick in 06) you WILL hate this movie. The innumerable plot holes, flakey and unbelievable human characters, terrible special effects and even worse directing and fight scenes make this one of worse films I've EVER seen.***SPOLIER*** One of the HUNDRED huge plot holes included the Pred/Alien hybrid going from chest burster, to full-grown bad-ass in seconds (it takes off on an onboard Predator-ship killing spree and wipes out a ship of Preds before the ship even breaks Earth orbit.) AS IF. In the first AvP we saw a ship of Sr. Pred hunters drop off three juveniles hunters going on an ""earning their stripes"" hunting party, and then in the end saw them picking up the ""honored body"" of the juvenile that was left over at the end of the flick. Are we expected to believe that the single chest burster hybrid killed all these Sr. Hunters before the ship even broke orbit? Also, (and this was EXTREMELY cheap production value on the director/producer's parts) jars and jars and jars of face-huggers somehow magically appeared aboard the Pred ship, even though the entire temple complex and queen Alien were destroyed in the AvP flick. These face-huggers end up playing an intregal part in movie...of course. And how about all these face huggers becoming full-grown Aliens in a days time? What a joke. Although there were many many more plot holes, I don't think IMDb would appreciate me filling up their servers by writing them here.On the flakey and unbelievable characters, well, where should I go boys and girls? Where to start...almost all of these goof balls are cliché people from other films or TV shows. The town bad-boy who left to avoid jail time but shows up just on the day everything happens to save the day??? Where did I see that? Oh yeah, last season on JERICHO!!! Then there's the 20-something town sheriff (a former trouble maker himself) who was best-friends at one-time with the bad-boy. Where did we see that? Oh yeah, JERICHO and Walking Tall! Then there's the generic soldier (WITH NO RANK) coming home from some generic war-front that isn't met like a long-missed loved one and hero at the airport or bus station, but at her OWN front door by her daughter and husband. And who is this soldier? What did she do in the Army/Air Force/Marines/Navy/Coast Guard? We DON'T KNOW because the movie NEVER TELLS US. But ... dunh, dunh, dunh...she was some kind of soldier/airman/Marine/sailor/coasty that knows how to drive a Stryker Infantry vehicle and ...magically... A HELICOPTER!!! This character is just a generic copy of every ""coming home"" service person...except that she brings home a set of night vision goggles to her daughter that cost SEVERAL HUNDRED dollars. These are things soldiers have to sign for and don't just ""bring home."" UGH!THe special effects and fight scenes are what pi-sed me off the worst though. These are the things I enjoyed the most in the first movie...watching Preds and Aliens go at it! The way this was filmed though, the action sequences were so dark and filmed so close up that you couldn't tell what was going on. You couldn't see who was doing what and what was going on as they were fighting it out. All in all, these hundreds of items are going to kill this franchise and the fanchise. No one is going to care anymore about seeing their favorite sci-fi movie monsters, and can only guess that the series will go down from here as producers won't like dump millions of dollars more on a sequel.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

967,ajonesh,I was rudely reminded why I don't read reviews before going to see a movie...,10,2 January 2008,"The day before I went to see AVPR, I read a bunch of these comments and then walked into that theater expecting to be disappointed (being a big Alien/Predator fan and all) but what I got was a great ride! IT WAS FANTASTIC!!! In the past movies it was always us/humans against them/aliens. This was them against them with humans just getting caught in the middle. The only thing I can see that you all objected to (those that were objecting) was the fact that humans weren't the center of attention - the main characters - the proverbial good guys.I like this movie because you get a more in-depth view of both of these two species; the 'aliens' are truly ruthless monsters who are only concerned with mercilessly continuing there own species; the 'predators' are honorable yet ruthless hunters with a strong sense of duty. The 'rescue predator' came to prevent the 'alien' race from wiping out our planet by destroying all evidence of every kind of alien life and killing any witnesses - militarily speaking, perfectly understandable (and Earth's military agreed at the end of the movie). The predators are not looking to wipe an entire species out, they just want that great hunt - any true hunter can appreciate that... Yeah there were a couple of things in the movie that we, as humans, hold sacred (children and pregnancy) but the whole point was to show that aliens didn't give a crap beyond their own re-population (and I have to admit, that little 9 yo boy did a hell of job acting!). And at least with the predator, I'd know where I stand and I could work with that; with the alien I would just kiss my butt good-bye.Personally, I'd like to see where the origins of the monster alien race came from. As long as the writers and producers don't go overboard, keeping things on a plausible even keel and don't go cheap on the special effects, this alien/predator fan says, ""Please sir, I want some more."" And, honestly, what true fan can say otherwise?PS: I didn't find anything about this film ""cartoonish"" or ""cheesy"" is the least little bit. Seriously people, movies are for entertainment - if you enjoyed yourself it did it's job. If not, shake it off and go on to the next one and spare the rest of us your misspelled, grammatically incorrect bad breath.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
968,Bergandi,Awesome Movie but wanted a bit more,8,2 January 2008,"I thought the movie was awesome but, and there always seems to be a but, anyway in the first Alien vs. Predators when they picked up the predator that died there were a whole bunch of Predators on that ship and in the second movie they made it seem like there were only 2! Second I am a major predator fan and I wanted to see more predators, they couldn't really have expected one predator to clean up all the aliens! And lastly I just think they should have showed the Predator Alien mix a lot more, they really kind of kept it in the shadows. I have to say even though they only put in one Predator he sure did kick a lot of Alien butt. I think they shouldn't even have needed the clean up guy because if they would have followed the first movie there would have been enough Predators to take care of the mix after they got to Earth. I wasn't expecting a lot of things that happened in the movie but I think it's good that you throw in a little unexpected things, it makes the movie a lot better.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

970,aurenwander,"Fills in much of the back story for the AvP universe, but needs a better director to create the feeling of dread and suspense the original movies created.",7,3 January 2008,"SPOILERS: First off, this movie served it's purpose from a number of angles. Number 1 it brought our two ET baddies back together for another showdown. Number 2 it filled in some of the back story regarding the ""corporation"" that Ripley works for in the original Alien movie. Number 3 it gave some insights into the predator culture and number 4 we get to see more predator toys.Some people didn't like the movie because it seemed to show the ""elite predator"" as having some issues with dealing with the alien swarm. Girl next to me was surprised he ever missed. Ironically, if the predator never missed or had trouble with a target, the movie Predator would have been about 30 minutes shorter. His weapons don't make him perfect, just very formidable. Fact remains, he took on an entire alien hive in the expansion phase and did fairly well.The acting was bad, although arguably not nearly as bad as in AvP. I won't say the relationships or char development was any worse then in the previous movies. I mean let's be honest here, Predator twoeven Alien (heresy I know) had far fewer ties between the characters. I think a lot of the people who don't like that need to re watch the old movies, because character development was never a huge thing for any of the movies beyond the main protagonist.We did get to see some rehashes of old alien techniques. They cut the power, took out the police station, they hit up the hospital for weak prey and prey that could provide more aliens, they used a sewer system to develop their hiveeven got in another swimming shot which looked awfully like the same shot minus the structure used in resurrection (may have been a direct lift of the film actually). What we didn't see. Aside from Dale's face, we didn't see much of the acid damage caused by alien blood. We didn't see the bleeding alien she shot on the helo eat through the nosecone into the avionics. We didn't see the alien spit acid at people keeping it at distanceeven when the predator ripped out his mouth, the acid didn't spill on him much or cause any damage. That was a fundamental piece of alien lore they needed to expand on.For the predswell we know aliens take on the physiology of their hosts. We can then go by extension and say that Preds probably have litters of little preds when they have young (hospital preggers scene). The predator used some nifty tactics in the sewer and the pawn shop (bait anyone), the twin cannons were fun, and we got a glimpse of a predator home world. So the movie filled in quite a bit of lore about the predators we haven't seen in the pastalthough some of the books hinted at it.What the movie needed more off. The national guard troops needed a little more development. The sheriff needed more supportive deputieshe was hanging out with a ex-con most of the time instead of his own guys. Hate to say it, but the blond girl should have gotten naked. You want more starsgive the fans what they want. They needed to take the 5-10 minutes to develop the opening sequence better. A director should know by now that the first few minutes is what creates the MOOD of the movie. In Alien/Aliens it was the slow cycling up of the deep sleep containersthe stillness of the ship that let you know it was going to be a horror flick. In Predator it was the approach of Arnold's team to the jungle beach base that let you know the people involved were unique. This movie opened with a ship with about 3 predators on itwhen the end of the last movie showed roughly 100 or so. The implication is this ship is taking their buddy home and the main ship is somewhere else. But they needed to show that. There is no explanation where the facehuggers come fromexplain it. Explain why you still linger over earthbasically the opening should be redone for the DVD release.What the movie needed less off: The Bourne Identity style of editing a fight scene. We don't want to get motion sick watching a movie. Show them fighting, not a dirty blur. Use a wide-angle lens to show the fightit was hard to tell who was winning the fight with the Predalien vs predator sequencenot because it was evenly matched, but because it happened in the dead of night in a rain storm and the majority of the shots were so tight you couldn't see whose dreadlocks were whose.Finally, the final sequence involving Yutani makes sense. In alien, Ripley was working for Weyland-Yutani, by Alien, the two companies had merged. So in the first movie we see how Weyland got a hold of some of the ET tech. In the second AvP movie we see how Yutani get's some of the technology; previously we'd seen Peter Keyes (Predator 2) in the possession of some Alien technology. As for the comment about the military not giving alien technology to a private corporation; I don't think that's implausible. I mean right now our military has handed over other aspects of their functions (say security operations) to private contractors and there aren't that many military research labs around anymore, it's almost exclusively FFRDcs or corporations.Overall I give it a 7/10 because I had my hopes set for something much better. But I'm glad they got some more of the story out there. Maybe the next incarnation of this movie will be done right and all previous sins will be forgiven.Maybe they'll pull the other Predator thread and have the next AvP set on a jungle island Raphael Adolini's pirate crew as the humans.

They added new things they really shouldn't have - about as badly as they did in revolution...They portrayed the solders in the movie as too weak. The character development was not there and you were kind of glad when they did die - not the emotion I should have had.Overall bad movie and it saddens me as an aliens and predictor fan.

Only if the quality of the first Alien/Predator movies came back to the screen, now that would be something. This purely ruins Ridley Scott's, James Cameron's, and definitely HR Giger's work.

976,h-danielsson,I waited 86 minutes to see 15 really interesting seconds!,4,5 January 2008,"I'm going to spoil a bit about some story events here, or it would be very hard to describe (IMHO) the worst script in an Alien/Predator/AvP -related movie so far, so please don't read further unless you don't mind spoilers. I've only seen the movie once, and this is my first impression. I might change my mind slightly if I see it again, but I doubt I can forget this first experience and what got stuck in my head the first time through.Well, let's start from the top: The first part of the intro we've seen in trailers etc is a nice start, but after that they reveal everything at once! (Except for the very last part of the movie, and a few highlights...) Inexperienced actors slow down the ""second intro"", supposed to introduce the main human characters, but it gets tangled up in some superficial love-story which feels like a 15 min cut 'n' paste job. Why is it even in there? Was there anything of that kind needed in the other movies? Next comes facehuggers in swarms, chestbursters here and there, aliens crawling all over the place, an ""invincible"" Predator which seems like a rookie with James Bond gadgets, and of course the regular occurrences of the Predalien from the intro. What happened to keeping things secret/unknown? Aliens begin spreading and soon there is some more tacked on love-story ""drama"" just to place a few characters where some of them need to be killed, so the survivors can run screaming away from there.The cops/fire dept. have no idea what's going on at first (missing people, random fires here and there, buildings getting blasted apart etc). After a few bodies turn up with big holes in them and a teenager says ""something"" (which he doesn't even describe) killed his friends, the Sheriff goes ""all in"" and calls in the National Guard(!) without having a clue about what he's facing.There's nothing interesting about the NG guys so I won't bother writing more about it.What made all the previous Alien/Predator/AvP movies so good (ruthless and scary things creeping about killing people when they least expect it, even if it's just one of them) is nowhere to be seen, now it's more like Starship Troopers, but without the humor which actually made that movie work. There is some character development, but none of it is relevant to the story and just feels like fill-out material.The fights are decent, but the camera angles, moves and shakes are so terrible you have to guess what's going on much of the time (if it's even within view!). Why can nobody get this right anymore? Costumes are great even though the Predator sometimes moves and looks as stiff as the Terminator.The rest of the story is like any other ""run-to-rescue-past-every-enemy""-movie out there. You know what's going to happen because you've seen it so many times before. All you're doing is waiting to draw lines between names and what killed them before the final fight/rescue scene. (Which smells ""the east way out"" long way...) There's good action, I'm not saying otherwise, but as an Alien/Predator/ AvP fan, I expected a bit more than action.I was going to write about some actual highlights here, but I forgot what to write, probably because the flaws stood out too much...I don't want to spoil the very end of course, but this part was actually interesting since it adds a small piece of the puzzle of how things came to be as they are in the Alien movies. I waited for things like this all throughout the movie and expected them to appear here and there just like in the Alien movies and AvP, but no. Only at the very end did we get something substantial.Maybe it would have had a better chance with the original directors which, IMHO, seem to know a bit more about what made the previous movies so good.If the third movie (of course it'll become a trilogy, what doesn't these days) ends up in a similar way, I'll weep knowing what the two last movies could have been, but weren't allowed to...AvP was legendary, AvPR is... well, a decent successor, but it could have been so much more...",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
977,escaflowneyk,So will there be anymore Alien film in the future,1,11 January 2008,"The plot is actually not too bad. I am sure every plot has its holes. I think it should create enough drama and excitement. However, I think the directors just too focused on making a ~90mins film to tell the whole story without getting the audience more emotionally evolved. The pace is far too fast without enough suspensions and depth. There are some dialogue and lines are really awkward. For example when the girl talked to her Mum at the end...she just asked if all the monsters had gone but not a word or question about her father. Didn't she witnessed her Dad got caught by the alien? There are many other unsubtle treatment in the ending which really disappointed me..and many of you I believe. In brief I think the movie is like bringing the audience to a PC game adventure. There is only a killing/fighting/fleeing theme but none of human emotions in reality is expressed here, and it is enough to downgrade this film into something that seems to be worthless to some people. I hope the brothers have learned a lesson. I am a big fan of Alien. I am still hoping to see an Alien movie as good as the first 3. Looking forward... though disappointed again and again.... :(",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
978,gurkishan13,What the hell happened....??,1,7 January 2008,"I had seen AVP1 and had enjoyed it thoroughly. AVP1 involved a certain formulation of story derived from the Predator and the Alien series.Thus, the expectations from AVP-R were very high but frankly, it was a big disappointment. Exceptfor the Black faces and ugly moaning, there was nothing else to see. What was the basis of the predator coming to earth and then fighting tons of aliens all by himself. And what was the point in killing pregnant mothers all around without much thought? This movie was surely made without a script-- and with a sincere idea to bore people to death. Please don't make more of this crap! They just killed the series.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

980,diamondbackz,Could have been so much better,4,22 January 2008,"I loved the blood and gore. The kind of violence is what Alien and Predator movies are about which is no one is spared. This truly answers the question of how it would be like if aliens were on Earth. The answer to that is simple. We are screwed. The effects were beautiful. How ever there are some real problems with it.1) The acting was horrible on the part of the Human characters side witch almost put me to sleep because of how dry and boring it was which really interrupted the flow of the movie and was very annoying. The writers could have done SOOOOOOO much better. The good part was the Alien and Predator acting which I thought was done very well for the most part.2) The size of the Predator ship was much smaller then how it was in the first AvP movie. This I scratched my head on 3) Predators having their mask on while still in the ship. This upset people and I cant understand why. Its not a plot hole like most people make it to be. So I say to you people calm the hell down. Its no big deal. If it will make you feel better, remember, they did have face-hugger's on bored in storage so that could be a good reason why.4) Predator firing its plasma caster inside the ship. I thought that was rather stupid on the Predators part. But then I began to think if it was a younger Predator that panicked.5)The hunter and his son almost instantly arriving at the crash site after it fell several miles away. At least they didn't bore us by showing them run through the woods for 30 min. so be happy about that.6) Why did only one Predator go? I thought this was odd. But then I thought that it was because he thought it was only one Predalien that he was dealing with and not an outbreak.7) Why didn't the Predators in the ship self destruct? Well if people were paying attention one did, but he was killed before he could completely activate it.8) The unlimited blue melting goo. I thought that was rather dumb.9) Predator hiding evidence with the goo but skins a cop. That was also dumb.10) The black out. Well come on people, an Alien and Pred did fight it out at a power station.11) Predalien being half face-hugger/queen. This really ticked me off. I am an Alien and Pred fanatic. I know for a fact that Aliens DO NOT DO THAT!! Just like they don't give birth like a human does like they showed in Alien4!! Out of all the comics, games, books, and the movies 1,2, and 3, CLEARLY shows their behavior. They need a queen to lay eggs, the eggs hatch into face-hugger's, face-hugger's infect host, the parasite pops out and kills host and grows into a drone if it infects a human, a Predalien with a Predator, and Runner with any kind of four legged animal. And then after living for years upon years then they molt into a Preatorian (a mini me queen that does not lay eggs) I can go on and on but I wont. But that scene alone nearly ruined the movie for me. If the directors are smart they would go back and edit that by making a face hugger infecting the pregnant women.Any way if you are going to see this movie, just go see it for the Aliens and Predators. And when the scene comes up where the Predalin infects that pregnant women... Close your eyes so you don't have to see that insult to the Alien and Pred universe.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Having done so and by entering with bad expectations from the many reviews ... i decided not to think of this movie as the alien(s) or Predator 1 & 2 standard and the movie was still painful to watch.i really was waiting for it to end and the end was worse than the start.* many bad things, I'm sure others already filled in. * good things hmmmm, cant think of anything... really... * will i watch it again on DVD? i watched AVP1 maybe twice.. this one no.thanks",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Hopefully we have not seen the end. Have we ever thought about filming the civil war between the Preditors and the Aliens with out the humans involved? You have shown the great hatred both have for each other. Everyone seems to show the Aliens as just animal not a high tech society.Here comes some spoilers everyone so beware.When you had the face hugger grab the little boy at the beginning I was cheering, never has a film shown this before. Truly shows how we are just ants in their path. When the Highschool girl takes the spinning at the end holy SH*# was I just amazed. I only wondered why the Predator was trying to cover up what was going on and why only one went after the ship, still I loved the movie and will suggest it to everyone that I talk to.

983,jaymesburr,What is wrong with everyone?,9,13 January 2008,"I don't know why there are so many negative comments for this movie, it was great! You would have to be thinking ""AVPR is going to suck,"" to even think it is bad. I do realize that there is other people that gave this movie a nice, decent rating; but shame on those who didn't. It wasn't PG-13, which already suggests it should be a halfway decent movie. The Predator kicks ass, especially with the blue liquid (I don't know why someone said those scenes were horrible) and blasts the heads clean off the potheads. I will admit, a plot was somewhat absent from this movie, but if you look deeper the ""plot"" is the Predator killing off all the Aliens. The brutality was exceptional (I recall the scene of the one blonde girl running and she gets pinned against the wall by the Predator's razor disk. I can perhaps see the side of those who hated it though, maybe their not hardcore fans of horror movies (I am), but cut it some slack. The only reason I am not giving a 10 is because the theater screwed up AVPR with Alvin and the Chipmunks (omg). If AVPR ever gets a lower rating than AVP I will be deeply saddened.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

One predator arrives on earth and he starts killing aliens and humans. 4. Then one human jet drops a bomb and kills human, aliens and predator. 5. Some humans find the shoulder canon of the predator. 6. The End Directors should consider refunding money back to the viewers.

986,bobbyrobson-2,Terrible terrible writers and producers ruin a potentially great film!!,4,18 January 2008,"This film could be potentially very very good. However whoever wrote this should find a new profession as they have simply ruined what for me is one of the most exciting concepts in sci-fi film. The first film (AVP1) for me did not fill many of the criteria I was looking for yet it had something to it that left you leaving satisfied and wanting more. Unfortunately I cannot say this about AVP:R. At the start of this film there are hints that this might just be the film everyone is looking for, as the film goes on this hope severely fades typified by an absolutely shocking ending.(well done again writers!).Heres what this in my opinion needs in order to be a classic; 1. Some background information leading on from the last film. 2. A plot that leads us towards at least a small scale war between a load of aliens and several predators. 3. A tonne of gadgetry from the predators, innovative, new and cool weaponry we haven't seen before. 4. MULTIPLE PREDATORS!!!!!!!!!! 5. Some sort of big turning point e.g aliens destroy everything but all of a sudden humans look up to see predator pods descending on earth ready for a mega fight.(just a thought) 6. Some awesome fight scenes. 7. A GOOD ENDING! Where for me the predators somehow save the day with an utter display of carnage taking down the aliens. Or the aliens looking like they are going to rip there way through earth are halted by a new load of predators leading us onto AVP3.This film provides us with a little bit of gadgetry and some OK fight scenes. Apart from that it doesn't do anything else like we are looking for; 1. Firstly the beginning all your saw was one predator almost sitting in an arm chair who decides to travel back to earth. 2. Only 1 predator!!! why oh why not have more, I cannot see why they wouldn't do this it is absolutely ridiculous. 3. Poor fight scenes this could be easily improved on. The final fight/punch up at the end between alien and predator was just a joke. 4. Far too many human deaths. literally every time a human was introduced a alien turned up does his thing and thats it. 5. The whole obscene baby ward thing (yes baby ward) signalled at this point what a complete and utter pathetic effort was made in making this film. 6. And the epitome of why this film is so terrible and whoever wrote it is an overpaid idiot ruining a franchise is the ending with the bomb just obliterating all the aliens is just awful it is like someone just couldn't be bothered to think of anything else and simply thought of taking the money and running. It was up there with the it was all a dream scenario and negated everything that happened leading up to the end.Despite some moderate fight scenes this film was poor and I severely hope that whoever wrote/produced this gives up writing films because you have ruined this for me and I can imagine a lot others!!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
987,marky_2006,Dreadful,2,18 January 2008,"Considering I have enjoyed most of the previous alien and predator films (including the original ""Alien"" and the first ""Alien Vs Predator"") I was looking forward to seeing this one. However, I was greatly disappointed.This film is possibly one the most appalling I have seen in my entire life. It was so predictable that you could foresee the outcome of the movie by the end of the first 10 minutes. There was absolutely no point in the film where I was unsure of what was going to happen next, the suspense was pointless. In fact the film actually had me laughing at points because of the abysmal acting and lack of intelligence that the characters possessed. By far the most awful film out currently and, in my opinion, one of the worst I have ever seen, and I have seen many good and bad films! I suggest you save your money.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Also the Taboo subject of of children being killed! to me it just added that extra dimenshion! now come off it people! this is sopposed to be two warring Factions going at it hell for leather and we the humans are just cannon fodder and egg-sacks! so tough that is that. so lets just take our heads out of the sand and stop reading into every misdameanour this films seems to put out! as is pointed out by all the saddo's on this site.

I hate the way they never show the alien fully, in light, standing tall and looking pretty. The fights scenes are so pointless, you cant even see whats going on cause its zoomed in too much. I actually left the cinema rubbing my eyes because the flashing and lack on decent zoom ruined my vision. The acting was pure CORN, why would you put a hot girl in an Alien movie? It should have been like the previous alien movies; good zoom, awesome actors (ripley), no crappy Cornie lines, just pure good classic material.

Just the way an Alien and Predator movie should be, not to much of a story, brutal action and great special effects! The movie is full of action and the effects are beautiful. The best part of the movie is that there are no clichés. It is therefore full of surprises. In the beginning of the movie you see a boy in love with a beautiful girl, so I figured that they survive and live a happy live, as you see in most movies. But not in this case!

Then along came came Alien Resurrection and the aliens became ""grrrr! roar! I'm a big scary monster that growls!"" which was not scary in the slightest. It was nothing more than a badly thought out action movie.Unfortunately rather than follow the example of the good movies AVP and AVP2 have followed the ""roar! I'm a big monster!"" crap from the badly reviewed Alien Resurrection movie. The aliens look sh!t, sound sh!t and wouldn't frighten a paranoid schizophrenic. Then there's the fact that the ENTIRE MOVIE IS IN THE DARK AND YOU CAN'T SEE WHATS GOING ON. Wow, the power is out, what a surprise, and guess what, the few lights that are working are flickering for some strange reason.

The fight was excellent too. So, I was willing to watch the Alien vs. Predator 2 for sure.However, Alien vs. Predator 2 is extremely bad. This makes me so disappointed. The scene is so boring that I nearly fell a sleep. All the fights between alien and predator is almost the same. My friend sat next to me in the cinema had slept with big sneeze sound.

I went to the cinema expecting absolute alien/predator carnage, big 1 on 1 fight scene's and general gore that is usually associated with the other films. There wasn't much of this at all!! The plot was pretty bad, (sorry to spoil it for those who haven't seen it) but they only sent 1 PREDATOR to deal with the new 'breed'? The shots of this new monster are so dark, you barely see what it looks like. It doesn't do an awful lot. I was waiting for the big exciting fights that we saw in AVP 1 and the 'edge of the seat' moments. Nope- didn't happen. I am afraid to say that this film does not live up to the others at all and it looks as though all the film budget has been used on the explosions instead of the butt-whooping we all wanted to see. If you like the other alien/predator films, I suggest seeing this if you want to feel a bigger appreciation for the previous films.

994,m-pritchard,Perhaps this is a franchise that should be ended,3,28 January 2008,"As a big fan of the original Alien (1 - 3, hated 4) and Predator films I was quite upset that the first film in this franchise was aimed at a young audience. Then comes along the second instalment which follows straight on from the first which seems to be aimed at a more adult audience. Wrong.This film was made with one type of person in mind, your average mindless teenager with a short attention span, lets not bother with the boring plot and wooden acting lets talk about the film itself.Firstly the original aliens were scary, the hunted in packs, you could barely see them in the places the hid (eg the final scene from alien), and they really had a menace about them. In this film they are some comical parody of a velociraptor from Jurassic Park.Take the predator, this guy looks as though it's his job to stop any breach of the aliens from getting out of hand, shame he's really useless at it and whilst tries to be careful by destroying all evidence of the aliens takes the power out for the whole town. Didn't see that coming.In short this film holds nothing to the original films and was directed like a very bad horror movie cashing in on some of the most iconic sci-fi characters.

The games were awesome, i truly thought AVP was a good one. This has got to be the worst possible movie that AVP could create... Really, two great movies put together in one... Should be a mega movie! But... With AVPR things are really screwed up... They went on a cheap budget *everything is set in the dark, you never really see many scenes of Complete aliens and predator, because of the dark, the actors weren't really that good*. They screwed up majorly by changing a lot about the Aliens and Predator. Aliens don't puke eggs into other victims... Since when did three burst out of a person, that hive formed awful fast.. Like AVP:1 the chestbursters form pretty darn fast, predator doesn't go around dissolving bodies, he has nothing to hide but would rather just bomb the place and go home, they changed the sound of predator, while the military people were killing off some aliens they played the same sound clip twice. lol, Guess this movie also shows there are very unintelligent predators, just like people... and the ending... retarded...

997,lone_wanderer73,Who funded these guys to make a movie?,1,31 January 2008,"First I'll start with what was good about the movie. Awesome premise - I'd been waiting for someone to use this scenario since before Aliens 3. This movie had a decent plot development and good action sequences. I would say excellent action sequences, except for the fact that it was so damn dark, I could barely see them. And with that I'll get into, the bad. First off, Hollywood directors please take note; MAKING EVERYTHING TOO DARK IS NOT A COOL AMBIENT EFFECT - IT IS AN ANNOYANCE. I spent most of the time watching the film, straining my eyes, trying to figure out what I just saw. Super-Quick flashes of action in the dark, and most of the time I didn't know what I was looking at. From the lighting alone, watching this film becomes exercise in frustration. The dialogue and character development was abysmally horrible. As in must have been written by someone who hasn't hit age ten yet horrible. Now granted, with an action film like this, you don't expect Oscar material, but this script was worse than a 70's B rated horror movie. And the character development is so lame, even for an action movie, that you can't feel any more attachment for the main characters than you do for the ""red-shirt"" disposable extras in the background. And top it all off with an ending that is a complete rip off (I won't dish out a spoiler, but you'll know what I'm talking about if you see AVPR. Actually come to think of it, ). If they could have generated as little as a ""cable-action movie"" quality script, and found a couple of set lights to make the movie visible, I would have given it about a 7. But as it is, I give it a 1. Alien and Aliens are two of my all time favorite movies, and I liked both Predator movies. But this one was awful. Let's hope if FOX lends the franchise to another horror movie, they'll be a little more picky about who gets to make it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Come on now, the Alien series was such an excellent and advanced movie for its time, they should have just left it at that, what a disgrace to the Alien series and to the classic Predator. Arnold is probably crapping his pants right now thinking of how horrible this movies was. What a disappointment. If you wanted to butcher a movie head towards another Saw movie and leave the classics alone, what a flop. I would never recommend this movie to ANYONE. The first AVP, not bad, but this one, what a disgrace. The story line sucked, the graphics sucked, the aliens sucked and even the predator sucked. Boo!!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

1000,gts123,Much better than expected,9,1 February 2008,"After the generally poor reviews by some, and the lowish rating here on IMDb, I was not expecting much from this sequel, but was very pleasantly surprised. IMHO much better than the first AvP film and more like my favourite original Aliens (2) - lots of action, a minimal but adequate character build-up, and great special effects. If you are a fan of the Alien or Predator films, or indeed the great PC multi-player games AvP & AvP2, I would recommend you ignore the poor reviews and go see it with an open mind. In fact I am struggling to think of anything negative to say about Requiem - the music and sound effects were excellent, the acting good, the storyline nicely fitted into the whole series of films. I guess the only departure from the earlier films is that there is not one single strong character who dominates the story like the Ripley or Dutch or Harrigan characters - but I think that is a good thing and a bit more 'believable'.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1001,Alexander_Zero,Don't dismiss it! This should have been the first AvP movie! Sheer brilliance....,10,1 February 2008,"For some reason this movie is being dismissed out of hand by individuals who claim to be fans of the Alien and Predator chronicles.As a seasoned science fiction movie viewer who vividly remembers hiding behind the sofa at age 10 (6 years after Aliens release) whilst watching Sigourney Weaver get even with the Alien Queen, I can't understand why so many people are missing out on the brilliance of this movie.Alien and Predator movies were never about a 'plot' or even 'dialogue' for that matter. The essence has always been to create a dark, frightening monster movie, with technological and firepower elements, where almost all the humans and monsters get killed but somehow the hero gets away (barely!). This formula seems to work best. Alien 3 may have been more exciting if it had shied away from it's attempt to capture detailed human emotions, and Alien Resurrection would have been better if it they didn't keep on stopping to explain things in the middle of it all!This film has it all: Aliens, Predators, facehuggers, chestbursters, acid blood, glow in the dark predator blood, a resin hive, spaceships, hunting, marines, explosions, nuclear blasts, weapons, infra red, an APC, extreme fear, skinning alive, no mercy, even a couple of sexy women........but best (perhaps scariest) of all, it's all set in a small town in Colorado. This really brings the fear to Earth like never before!The Alien and Predator story lines always partially repeat each other in the movies, as with any good movie franchise (see Back to the Future Trilogy) which may irritate some people expecting true originality.There is an organisation which lies to the people (usually 'the Company', here the US Army), the alien that resembles the embryo host, a new method of reproduction (as in Alien Resurrection), ""perfection matched only by hostility"", an escape attempt that looks hopeless, a scared little girl talking about ""monsters"", and a hero who almost doesn't make the evacuation. We always expect an alien stowaway with the evacuation, but in this film it doesn't come, although the suspense does. A welcome change.Hardcore fans will note the reference at the end to Miss Yutani as in Weyland-Yutani: Building Better Worlds, referencing the Charles Bishop Weyland character played by Lance Henriksen in AvP 1, and earlier as the Bishop android in Aliens & Alien 3 (where Weyland's descendant has a cameo, also played by Henriksen). Clearly this is the firm which reverse engineers Predator technology to advance space exploration and terraforming, hence the story lines of Alien and Aliens can emerge years in the future. Simple yet elegant.The blue chemical which the Predator uses to dissolve the Alien evidence is brilliant.The only things missing are a flamethrower and a grenade launcher, and perhaps the line ""They mostly come out at night....mostly"". But I certainly don't miss the pyramid in Antarctica which, as a former archaeologist, I couldn't help but laugh at during the first AvP movie.If you are a true fan of the universe that has developed around the Alien and Predator movies, novels, and graphic novels, you will see that this movie has really paid attention to detail. Just don't watch it if you are expecting a deep analysis of the human condition, because it's not there. Or is it? Oh, and if anyone else complains that the movie is dark and you can't see anything I'm going to have to restrain myself.....immediate E-VAC.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1002,dan_guglielmo,Just made for the money,3,3 February 2008,"There was basically no plot to this movie. All that happens is people run away from the scary aliens. The movie just tries to see how far it can go with the violence. They don't show babies getting killed per say but i pregnant women is killed and a young child is killed at the beginning of the movie. It does relate at all to any of the previous movies. I felt that they made the movie just because they wanted some extra money. This movie didn't deserve the sit through that I gave it. The ending wasn't even good like come on, they bomb the city so that everyone is dead and then they lock up the weapon that they retrieved at the end. The movie just simply didn't have any depth to it and was purely just suspense thriller. Well, If you like gore then maybe you will like this movie, but if you are looking for anything more that people running from aliens, then this isn't the movie for you.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

If you want total slaughter with aliens and predators tearing each other apart on the other hand you will indeed enjoy this totally brainless mayhem. I love watching these 2 1/2 alien species battling it out, just cant get enough of it. I would be unfair to this whole movie if i ever rated it below 10 because it totally rocks my carnage braincells in my head. Many movie lovers dislikes movies that only contains butchering and raw action and i cannot blame them for that, my own opinion is that some movies was made with brains and should be watched as such while others was made with only one thing in mind...

I got no idea what Colin and Greg Strause where thinking when they signed on to this project, obviously they didn't read the script, only the title name. This movie starts out right after the first one ends, and then its all down hill from there. The script calls for an in-depth look into the life of back ground characters who end up being the expected collateral. I found myself playing solitaire through the first 30 minutes of the DVD, it was that boring. Its got the usual blond bimbo who runs around in her underwear screaming with her boyfriend, its got the classic illogical appearances of the anti-protagonist pretty much everywhere you want it to be, a swimming pool, a hospital, a power-station... yawn. This movie would have been so much better if it was just the predator hunting the aliens for an hour and a half. after all, we paid money to watch an action movie, not Dawson's Creek with a horror twist.On the plus note, the special effects were pretty good.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

I can't honestly believe that the Strause brothers actually saw one of the Aliens or Predator movies before filming this waste of celluloid. It's just appalling to see how low Hollywood is willing to go for some quick cash. So please don't see this movies and don't provide the studio with money to make more of these bad stains.This movie has been hyped to the max and that usually is a good indication of what to expect.

The movie was probably made that way so we don't notice to much the bad acting. Also the movie is just a ripoff of the others alien and predator movies, they copied/paste the old scenes and story with different actors and they've mixed it all together in a total piece of junk. The memorable scene with Seagourney Weaver facing the alien in alien 3 was remake into a scene with an acting so bad that you prey to forget it to not think about it when you'll re-watch alien3. In the middle of the movie the army comes in full squadron without having taken a full report of the situation and without knowing the threat and that's at that moment that you say to yourself they gonna bomb the city at the end and the more u watch the movie the more u think i can't wait till the bomb so the torture will end. Finally at the end of the movie they make you focus on an almost intrigue, so that you think the movie was good and make you feel that you want to know where they will be going with that story and make more money by making another cheap mix of the alien and predator movies at low cost, fast recorded, and big profit outcome movie.They've completely laugh at us, the consumer, by making this movie.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

The only problem seemed to be that the fallen predator was carried onto a huge ship with seemingly hundreds of predators, however it easily could have been carried off in a smaller ship from inside the mother ship. No organism is the perfect organism, they obviously didn't look at their fallen comrade thoroughly.. Basically, it was good and suspenseful enough.

I've been a AvP fan my whole life and this movie has the extra things the first movie didn't have. As in violence, and more violence.The predator has to be one of the stupidest predators I've ever witnessed in comics/TV. I don't know how he survives most of the engagements he gets in, its almost like he's a ""super predator."" It seems as if the aliens always has the advantage on him.I also don't understand how so many aliens can be made in such a short period of time. An entire army rises out of no where. Its like ""just add water,"" and poof, instant alien.The final battle was one of the stupidest things I've ever seen in my life. It reminds me of how bad the last blade movie was, where he suddenly had a urge to pull some WWE moves out of no where.Fox really did a horrible job on this movie. The action is the only part worth watching. It has one of the worst endings I've ever seen in all of the movies made to date. I thought Aliens 4: Resurrection had a bad ending, but this was horrible.Its worth watching, but I'd borrow it from a friend. Don't go out and support this type of trash. FOX needs to learn how to stop ruining such a brilliant franchise. They need to release the rights and let someone else take over, because they are ruining the name.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1012,tioshard,A waste of film and a cinema ticket,1,22 January 2009,"As a massive fan of both the Aliens and Predator movies I liked the idea of having AvP film/s. The first was certainly watchable although not what any real fan of the franchises would have wanted. And even now it is a film I could go back to watch. But the second movie is nothing like the first in all the worst ways. From the beginning it seems like nothing more than a teen horror flick, in fact I believe that is it in a nutshell. You are introduced to characters you want to die from the start and having the other two species basically being bad guys themselves, watching the movie is like a losing battle in itself. If tasteless and pointless gore is what you want to see then I guess this is the movie for you. But for depth, decent characters, an OK sci fi movie in general, or a movie that doesn't ruin legendary movie monsters this is not the movie for you. I wish I could say the final battle scene was something to watch but too bad it's too dark and raining for you to really make out what is happening. Much like the dog fight scene in the Ang Lee Hulk movie, but at least that wasn't raining to.I always hear people say they walked out of the cinema half way through a bad movie, this would have been the case for me.

However the DVD boxset is suppose to be one of the best so it must be good on the big screen? Even if the DVD's are on wide screen. I liked not so loved these films as a kid but do remember them. On VHS and on the television. Good times with my father. The film starts straight after the first Alien vs Predator only this time in the forest. Now don't get me wrong but I thought the Freddy VS Jason film was better because it was more loyal to the series. It explain things keeping real to the fans when really it didn't have to because it got so far fetched. When Alien and Aliens first came out it looked to cool and really real for a good 14 16 years now it looks a bit dated and this version like a B movie.

In fact that is an insult to 12 year olds, I mean to say 12 year olds with bad taste in movies.First let me clarify that I thought this film was terrible, the only reason it got more than 1star was because I somehow managed sit all the way through it and for about 5minutes in there I was almost slightly entertained.As far as I can tell the reason this movie was as bad as it was is either because it was purposely written with a very young audience in mind or written/directed by someone with tremendously immature taste in film. Fair enough it had a lot of gore (and I'm as big a gore fan as the next sci fi/horror fan) but it was clearly thrown in to (i) distance itself from AvP1 and (ii) to try vainly to shock people. (The only people it would shock would be kids that snuck into the cinema)Think back to Alien/Aliens/Alien3 or Predator what should a movie with this much potential be like? Scary, jumpy, tense, unpredictable, edgy, dark and full of well timed well executed gore. This movie had none of those things.Inconsistencies, plot holes, bad acting, painful dialogue, very poor development of characters and a terrible ending aside: Honestly a bunch of teenagers and scared to death civilians fighting and killing aliens when futuristic marines get slaughtered in earlier movies??? Ridiculous is the only only word I can think of. A far cry from Arnie hunting the predator in the jungle.The point: if you are thinking about buying/renting this movie DON'T do it.

What bugged me was the ending... I'm sorry, but I'm TIRED of the happy endings they get out alive bit... too over done. I think the brothers did a good thing by kicking a couple cinema (NOTE: American cinema) taboos like having the kid get 'busted and the method of Alien re-spawning (gruesome, but EXACTLY what any hive-mentality creature of that sort would do, no morals involved...), so if there IS an alternate ending, wouldn't it maybe go something like this? Same, all the way up to the crash, but since the Gov officials already nuked the town, wouldn't they have gone ahead and executed the last remaining witnesses? secure the Pred-tech, then finish off the rest, like right after the mother says ""the monsters are all gone"" transferring the title onto us, as it really should be. Now I may be morbid for saying that, but that is honestly how that kind of shadow government WILL secure their gains.So, who's with me that this one blew Anderson's crap-fest RIGHT outta the water?

Why make the entire film at night, dark, wet and barely visible. We all love the creatures, let's see them! Granted the concept does require some dark, wet eerie ambiance but I found myself trying to see which image was predator or alien. The directors Colin and Gregg Straus should revisit a film class in lighting as the entire film was so under-lit at length it became annoying.

If an alien race was able to span the limits of space and be invisible to visible light wouldn't it stand to reason that they could land a spaceship without crashing it?

1023,dudekde,Could have been much better,4,19 April 2008,"First off, this movie wasn't as bad as some make it out to be. I do agree that there are MANY things that could have been done better and of course few things that left me scratching my head afterwards. I agree with many that this movie was WAY too dark. Half the time i didn't know who was who, if it was alien or predator, all you saw was blood and screams. That part was very irritating to say the least. I wish the whole idea of predator coming to earth was a lot better explained. In the movie all you see is some random predator getting an intercepting message about a vessel in distress, then he gets ready, gets on his ship and flies away! I think an 8th grader could have described that scene in a bit more detail. One thing that has always bothered me about the predator series was that you never really got the sense what predator and alien were all about. By this i mean where they are from, how they live, their class structure, if there is such thing. Random alien and random predators fighting is cool and all, but would love to see some ranks amongst them, so that you know that predator A is the leader of predators and alien A is the leader of the aliens. It would just add more depth to the whole watching and plot experience. Another thing was logic, or lack of logic in this movie. So a predator gets here, he sees that he eventually finds out that the aliens are out of control and there is no way in hell he can stop them all, yet you don't see him call back to his planet for ""backup"" or for another force to come in? Also, why would predator care about aliens on earth? Is it to recover the foreign species from the planet? I understand that it's for the hunt and such, but still, the whole plot could have been developed in more detail.The humans, are for the most part well played. I don't have too many complaints about acting in these types of movies. People are here to live and die and you are here to be entertained by the aliens/predators so i have no beef with lack of acting. It was OK for the most part.One more comment about the ending. The ending was stupid at best. Something about us recovering alien technology yet it mentions no detail about where it might lead as to make us believe that there will be yet another sequel to this thing. I don't know if AVP can take another sequel. Overall i give this thing a 4/10, acting was OK, plot was downright awful and left you longing for much much more. It's worth a DVD rental but i wouldn't pay 10 bucks to see this thing in the movies.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

The movie would have been good even with mindless violence but I was very offended by the use of kids and pregnant women in this film. I also think the fact that you can't leave a comment unless it is ten lines long or more shows that IMDb hates the little people that don't really want to sit in front of there keyboard for a long time trying to write enough stuff to fill there ten line quota. so I'm filling the rest of this space with a gripe about this sorry site for movies.

1025,piiit-2,"Failure as action, horror, thriller and adventure movie, just a mix of scenes in some sort of connection",1,21 April 2008,"I like the predator vs alien story in general, I would like to see more of their fights, the predators' technology and the ruthless nature of the aliens. Why do we create movies that focus more on how humans react to unbelievable events, rather than the more interesting fight between (as the title of the movie says) the alien and the predator? This is what we want to see, the aliens, and the predators, fighting! But the directors choose the scenes where humans try to show some feelings, or the lack of feelings and emotions, who knows really..because the actors are not good enough to show any of it. I can cope with pure mindless action movies, but this is not it, it fails because it shows too many scenes of the humans, some thin story lines that we could have done without because we have seen the exact scenes hundreds of times before. Give us what the movie is called! The few scenes that we get, are so dark, confusing and out of the order that you really don't understand anything. It's not scary because you're really just confused, they are everywhere they are nowhere, all of the sudden one is behind you.. ooo scary. Nothing makes any sense, it just gives you a headache.. two hours of watching rain, thunder and some shooting by someone at some place..Fails as action movie, fails as scary movie, fails as alien adventure movie.

First of all, I think a lot of fans were expecting some kind of Academy quality material; this is a MONSTER MOVIE. It has monsters. Watch and enjoy. If anything it is a vast improvement from the last one. AVP I was a tremendous heap of rubbish. I've loved both franchises since I was a kid, and was a fan of the AVP comic as well, so nobody was more disappointed than I was after the first movie. The predator was at least cool in this movie. Plot holes aside, he played his part effectively and was a bad-ass. In the first movie the ""actors"" in the predator costumes walked around like a bunch of constipated steroid freaks. They moved around like their butt cheeks were clenched or something. Too busy flexing. Also the actors in the second movie stayed out of the way. And what was with that ""tough-chick"" character in the first one? AWFUL. They should have killed her off in the first ten minutes...or later, at least. Whatever, I'd be content if there were no human characters at all. Dialogue's overrated. I like this movie. It's fun to watch. Just think, if you buy this movie they'll get more money.

That way, maybe, just maybe, suspense could be added. Not to mention how many different animals would be face-hugged, and we would have a DeerAlien, a WolfAlien, a SparrowAlien, and I can keep this up forever. SPOILER ALERT-skip this if you do not want spoilage! Second, what the heck is with this Homo-Narcissistic* movie era we've ended up in. It's the Aliens I want to see win, not the preds, not the humans. The humans are physically and psychologically incapable of handling an Alien. One Pred vs half a city of Aliens...I have no words...Really, that Pred should have been dead before he even got out of the forest :/, as he is not a skilled killer. Nuking the city was not supposed to be here. This is a movie about Aliens and Predators bashing each other at every turn, not about how immoral the US army can be. SPOILER ALERT ENDS *Homo-Narcissistic: A homo-narcissistic story, movie, or any sort of work is a piece of work that focuses on human perfection and idealism, and that humans can win any battle. Such stories usually end with the humans winning. (What a piece of rubbish) Think about why the Group of 7 is respected nowadays.Third, yeah, more preds.

1028,frenchmove,Not faithful to either the Alien or the Predator legacy,1,12 May 2008,"When I first heard that there was a move to create AVP1, my toes curled because I thought it was just doing both superb sci-fi franchises completely to death - after all, Predator 2 had not managed to capture the atmosphere of the first movie, and Alien 4 had just about made up for the diabolical mess that Alien 3 had left us with. But when I saw the end product, I was really impressed. Not so with this major, cash-machine, sell-out piece of garbage. It is hardly faithful at all to either legacy. The main absence is that of any kind of character. The genre seems to borrow from the Wes craven-type, teen slasher movie, which even Wes himself got sick of already. Instead of scantily-clad hotties being terrorised by Jason, Michael or Freddy, we see monsters prancing about, looking a lot like men in rubber suits. I'm writing this review instead of watching the end, that's how much I hated this movie.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1029,tegli4,Movie for gamers,8,13 May 2008,"What I'll start with is AvP2 is more related to computer games then the movies. As a result I suppose most movie fans wont get what they expect. Also consider watching AvP1 before you go for this one. You will know why when you do.The movie exploits the idea of alien with all his extras getting on the earth. People in a small town living their boring everyday live and then you get the mentioned above alien + extras. And the extra isn't small, we get a Predalien. Everyone that have played the game knows from the start whats that thing. Here i think is one of the biggest problems and its a problem with the fans that went to watch the movie, not the movie itself. The Predator in the movie knows what he is against (well shown). I believe thats the reason for him to be much more cautious then fans expectations. The Predators see the Aliens as the ultimate blood sport. Something that challenges everything you have. Predaliens are even bigger challenge.The biggest similarity between this movie and the games is the great amount of blood and gore. Dead everywhere. Everyone that have played the game knows what i talk about. For example Alien 3 - almost no blood and gore, just all the pressure that is building up is what gives you the thrill. The game is completely different thing. You are more concerned where the next one will come from then anything else.I'm a fan to the game much more then the movies. This movie was what i expected when i watched AvP1 and naturally I was satisfied with what i got.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

The predator was so pathetic it was unreal. And he was back to killing even the innocent and skinning them alive. There was only one predator sent back to kill all these aliens. Some of the scenes we couldn't even make out who was doing what in the fighting between the aliens and the predator. It reminded me of one of those pointless teen movies that we wasted our money on years ago. All the pointless killing was just ridiculous! I expected so much more.

Guts, blood, and gore sure does make a movie better. It is as if they are trying to compensate for the lack of the ""alien"" feeling in the first AvP by just throwing in a bunch of random slaughter scenes. Another complaint; the screenwriter threw in several plot lines to follow rather than one plot-line, like the original alien and predator movies. There is a goofy/retarded/renegade predator running lose in the woods, There is a kid and his dad who go missing, there is a story of these old people in a tunnel, which is vague and hard to follow, there is this pizza delivery boy having a hard time in high school because of this random dude who jumps him all of a sudden for no apparent reason other than saying hello to a girl. I stopped watching this movie about 45 minutes into it. Don't tell me ""Oh well you need to see it through in order to judge it"".

1035,registerphil,Dreadfully dark,1,8 July 2008,It's a pity the film makers didn't have the courage to light this movie properly. Half the time you can't see what's going on - the other half you just don't care. The storyline is near to incomprehensible - probably because you can't actually *see* what's supposed to be going on - the characters don't connect and you couldn't really care less what happens to them. The dialogs are vacuous and uninteresting. There's the typical show-down and a big explosion towards the end including the bad-guy general.This is one film that didn't require making. It's a complete waste of time and I wish I hadn't watched it...AVOID!,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Avp2 isn't at all dreadful, it is a 3-4 star film which contains blood and guts, who doesn't see that in sci-fi films? Maybe In one or two places it is a little predictable, but is still exciting to watch? I would Rather Congratulate the director than slate a film which doesn't deserve it. Further-more It Isn't at all predictable thanks to the creative story line used to re-create the idea. I disagree completely with most comments, if anything avp1 was a disappointment. I sat there predicting the fight scenes while 1 by 1 the humans were either, Stabbed,eaten,slashed or just simply impregnated by the aliens. And all this action was happening in a cave. At least Avp2 has a decent environment which on hd TV makes the movie come to life.

1037,incrowd,"It's LAME, and what a shame",2,25 December 2007,"This latest entry in the franchise was a big letdown. It turns the possibilities of an AVP story into a tired 'Friday the 13th' spam-in-a-cabin scenario.As with the first AVP, it's the human characters and their back-story that do the biggest disservice. No one cares about the cliché cookie-cutter people, not that you're give much opportunity. Even if their characters had been given ANY chance to develop, I'll guess I'd feel the same.The actions of the Predator often seem to run counter to established M.O. The plot drags in some areas and glosses over others too quickly. So many missed opportunities... Most action scenes are under-lit. What distinguishes one creature from another or from the background? Rather than conveying mood it shows a lack of conviction for shoddy movie-making. There have other sequels in the two film series that I've enjoyed, but it seems they both get a bit diluted every time a new movie hits the screen. It's a darn shame. There's still SO much potential here for a good kick-ass movie. I wonder if we haven't already lost the option for another film to feature JUST the aliens or JUST the predators?

I was way off. Not only are the script, acting and cinematography awful, but the entire movie is awful. The characters are one-note clichés of every teenager seen in a horror film since the early 80's, and the extraterrestrial creatures we've all come to know and love have been turned into schlock.

Thank God I didn't pay to watch it (my brother rented it)! I thought the first AVP was pretty bad, but this one takes the cake. The only reason I gave this movie a 1/10 is because there is no 0/10 option. I got the impression right away that there was no attention given to anything other than the fight scenes between Aliens and Predators, because those were the only parts that were even bearable. The directors also 'cross the line' by killing off kids and pregnant woman, as well as the love interest of the main character, which seemed to me a desperate grasp at the seat to keep me from flushing this movie down the toilet. To summarize, I request nothing less than every copy of this movie be burnt and sent on a rocket to the sun. Society is better off without this movie.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1041,stephenmichaelbounds,That was good pizza!,8,8 April 2009,"It's easy to criticize this movie. Anyone making an Alien picture has big shoes to fill, as a good deal is expected by fans who are understandably pessimistic by now. With the right people working together with me, and some lucky breaks, I would direct a fine Alien film. I would gladly direct Alien 5. If anyone at 20th Century Fox is reading this, drop me a line. That said, I liked this movie. I expected far worse, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was fun and very frightening. All of the actors are great and the aliens are for the most part not CGI (definitely a plus). I think it's very much a Friday night pizza date movie, which the film's creators seem to acknowledge with the fact that one of the principal characters is a pizza delivery guy. In this regard it never takes itself seriously, but it also doesn't ridicule itself. There's a good balance there. Perhaps the best aspect of this film is that visually it stands up beautifully with the other films, particularly Aliens and Alien 3. It's not as massively cinematic, but considering the financial limitations that this production must have had over the first four, I'd say it looks amazing. Now for the critique. I never liked an art class where everyone only says good things, so I'll be perfectly honest about what I feel are the film's two main limitations: exposure and pace. Too dark and too fast, respectively. The daylight scenes are far too rich with contrast, and the rest of the time it's difficult to see anything. No one ought to go darker than David Fincher. The other problem is that everything happens so fast that at the end of the movie I felt like I had just been on a fantastic roller coaster ride, but that's all. In Ridley Scott's commentary on the first Alien film, he recalls his concern at the time over the longer scenes during the first half, but says that he's now glad that they took it slow and saved the action for later, because then you can really ""rock and roll."" Timing is part of a structurally sound story dynamic, which is missing here. There's enough character development to make the characters likable, but not enough to make an intimate connection with any of them. There's nothing like an alien invasion to explore belief systems. M. Knight Shyamalan did a beautiful job of it in Signs, but Steven Spielberg, with his divorce and Pinoccio preoccupations, dropped the ball on his version of The War of the Worlds, so hey, it happens to the best of them. Not a problem. Not every movie has to be deep, but it's never a bad thing to entertain the upper organs too. Terminator 2 at least made a statement about nuclear war. If you're expecting a Conrad style morality play with robust character development you're not going to find it here, but if you're having a weekend slumber party alone or with friends and you want to see well filmed and well designed aliens and predators in the optimistic aroma of a fresh delivered pizza, you'll have a blast. I rated this 8/10 because for a B movie I think it's excellent.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1042,collectiveagency,A Disgrace to the Alien & Predator films,1,21 August 2009,"Let me start by saying i'am huge Aliens fan, i love Predator and i played the Aliens Vs Predator games to death and they were just fantastic. The first film bothered me and i didn't like it, but i didn't hate it. This ""movie"" however i do hate with a passion, heres why.My biggest problem with this film is that its set in suburban America! Thats not the iconic setting you come to expect from an Alien movie or the true AVP series which are the comics and games which are set in the same murky dark settings of the Alien films. It takes all the imagination that could have been had in a futuristic setting and dashes it. I just can not get over that, you have a great series of AVP comics and games that helped to create a truly great setting ,atmosphere,locations, characters and some great stories but no they went with the biggest horror movie cliché of all setting it in a small suburban town ignoring all the potential the AVP series and giving us a cheap horror flick, honestly sometimes when i heard an alien creep up on someone i almost expect Jason Voorhees to kill them instead.But lets talk about the Aliens and Predators, what can i say about them? well they look like they should at least. But the way they act is if you'll excuse the pun ""alien"" to how they would in the games and comics. The Predator is best example...hes meant to be hunting the Aliens but they manage to get the best of him a lot in the this, sneaking up behind him and if you know anything about Predators you'd know there's no way this would happen, they're highly trained killing machines and i just thought the whole thing was like cops and robbers, the Predator is the cop after the Aliens (the robbers) and they go around town running riot out witting him on every turn and quite frankly hes a joke, he cant even hit them with his shoulder cannon.The fight scenes...they where none in this movie, it was so dark i could never make any of it out. It sounded cool though. And also, i noticed a lot of the high tension scenes are just taken off the Alien and Predator movies...action for action. There's one in particular i just could not believe. Aliens corner a girl she sits up against a wall while the Alien brings his head down really close to hers to try and get some tension....remind you of that famous scene from Aliens 3? Yes because its exactly it, it was stolen and rehashed for this ""movie"". There are many other examples, such as the Predator healing his wounds up on a tree and letting out a roar afterward taken from the first Predator film.There were some issues with the music as well, for example any scene involving the Predator you hear that jungle music from the first Predator movie. No imagination at all, i'am not sure if this was want to be a homage or something but to me it just came off as ""look thats the predator music!"" trying to let us all know its going to be a scene with the Predator in it, awful, stupid, and unimaginative. They'res also a scene near the end, where a radar can be seen and it makes the noise of the motion detector from Aliens, now that may have been a homage but all it did was make me want to watch Aliens!!.Story, oddly there is none what so ever. First thirty minutes is a very bad teenage movie nothing appealing what so ever at all. Characters seem to just appear out of thin air in every scene they're just so uninteresting you don't want to get to know them you just want to see the Aliens and Predator killing them. By the end of the film i honest to god could not name any of the characters.Overall, Awful, one of the worst films i've ever seen.

If I had to compare AVPR to it's predecessors, all which I own (except for Alien 4, a terrible endeavor), it's right along the lines of James Cameron's Aliens and Predator II with Danny Glover. The movie really follows along like a graphic novel/comic book and the dialogue is straightforward, simplistic and adequate enough to hold your attention and even invest some interest in the characters. There are small relationships that are easily understood and portrayed by the great cast of largely unknown actors, non of which are immune to the onslaught of Predators and Aliens. As for intense and suspenseful scenes, there are definitely a few to keep you on the edge of your seat, with no holds barred action and plenty of collateral damage. I also love the fact that they used some quintessential sounds and dialogue from the previous films. If you are a fan of both the Alien and Predator films, I'm sure you'll enjoy this episode.

I know there are many directors who have strong views about the boundaries they apply to their movies.However, in this film I was very troubled by the baby and pregnancy scenes in the film and found them to be very disturbing. If we put ethics to one side though, the scene did not serve any purpose at all.How this film got a 15 cert in the UK is quite frankly unbelievable, while throughout most of the film you get the strong impression that all the director wanted to do is try and shock with completely over the top gore.That aside, the plot is non-existent and the dialogue is appalling. The coming together of many of the characters seems far from believable and the acting is also poor.The action scenes are reasonable however, but are ultimately let down by these shortcomings.I'm a fan of this franchise (or was) but the problem is that too many people are butchering it and showing little respect for the finer details and instead are hopelessly trying to appeal to the masses.Please.

Instead they just kill humans on the way to killing the Aliens. If the Predators are an advanced species then they would understand the importance of working with the humans to kill the bigger threat, the Aliens. Also, didn't the directors learn anything from the movie ""The Crow?"" If you make the movie so dark that nobody can see anything, then how in the heck can anyone enjoy the movie? Horrible. Making the movie at night and in the rain was just plain stupid. Also, there has to be a protagonist! The original Predator it was Arnold and that was fine. In, the first AvP, the protagonist was both the Predator and the Girl. But in this AvP Requiem, there isn't a Hero. They make both the Predator and the Aliens the bad guys. People want to root for someone. In AvP, it should be the Predator. Now, one can say that convict is the hero, but NOOOO.

The bar was set so low from the first avp, it could only be better. In the first AVP, the whole lost temple with every ancient civilization in Antarctica idea was just flat out stupid. This at least has the believability of an Alien or Predator movie. This was totally about the carnage, and there was plenty of it. The thing that everyone complains about is the multiple predators in the first avp and the predators movie, this had one, ultra bad-ass predator. The people who survived to the end didn't kill or even hurt the predator, yea they got a few aliens but they always get killed by a human or two. I am in no way saying this was a great movie, but for what it's supposed to be, its pretty good. Did you really expect an Alien vs Predator movie on the same level as the Godfather, or Shawshank Redemption? I hope not, you have to expect cheesy dialogue, lots of cgi/make-up effects, and lots and lots of bodies. This movie delivered all of those things.

1055,DontLookUp11-12-10,A Cinematic Cheese Time Machine,10,26 December 2007,"WARNING SPOILERS AHEADLike most people who grew up in the 80's I'm a huge fan of both franchises. And like most fans I was not pleased with the first offering of AvP. While there were some things that I liked in the first film, mainly the premise, but I was among those who wanted to walk out when the Predator teamed up with the chick and ran down the hall like Clooney and O'Donnell in nipple suits. That being said when a friend of mine asked if I wanted to see the film at an advance screening this past Tuesday in the toxicity of Century City, I still jumped at the chance. I liked the trailers enough, the TV spots playing during South Park were even better, and I thought the new Predator looked pretty bad ass. However, I still entered the theater with a cautious optimism, the scars from AVP ran deep. The film opens right where the previous installment left off. The PredAlien bursts from the dead Predator and runs amok causing the ship to crash. A hunter and his son are face hugged. A lone Predator receives a distress call. If you've seen the 5 minute clip you know the deal already. While I had already seen the footage I thought the Predator planet looked a lot better on the big screen. It was a nice balance of giving people a taste without demystifying the whole species. From there we are introduced to the main characters. The ex-con Dallas steps off a bus only to be greeted by the Sheriff, who he apparently used to be buddies with. Dallas' younger brother is poor white trash working as a pizza boy and getting his ass kicked by the jock douche bag in front of his crush. It's all pretty standard small town horror set up but it moves with enough pace that it doesn't linger on the less than stellar character development. Meanwhile the Aliens begin to burst and along with the PredAlien and facehuggers make their way to the sewers. There's another face hugger attack, which seemed to feature much more practical effects, that ends with the PredAlien getting really nasty on a homeless woman. In fact he seems to have a serious fetish for women in general, especially of the pregnant variety, but who doesn't? The Predator arrives and begins his investigation while more and more townspeople go missing. After the Predator tracks the Aliens in the sewer, the melee begins. I liked how the Predator wasn't really into fighting fair or following a code but just trying to get the job done. It was a needed change from the E.T. with mandibles and justified in the context of the story. Unfortunately, he makes the Aliens look pretty bad in comparison as they don't get the benefit of the usual Predator cockiness. He shoots first, uses laser mines, and a steel reinforced fist. But even that isn't enough to keep the Aliens down as they quickly escape the sewer and manage to spread across the town. This was the point where I expected the film to really kick into over drive but it still took it's time unfolding as Predator tracks the Aliens, the PredAlien tracks victims, and the humans just try to survive. It wasn't until the new medkit scene where the Predator sutures his wound as lighting flashes and the rain begins to fall that film really started to mean business. It's amazing it took this long to figure out that Aliens and Predators look cool fighting in the rain. Keeping things wet and dark really helps the look of both creatures and helps sell the whole man in suit thing. While I wasn't the biggest fan of Nispel's Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, I did like the look of Daniel Pearl's cinematography, I guess it helps that he shot the original too. However, Pathfinder's visual style really wore on me and seemed to get more and more muddled as that mess unfolded before my eyes. Here Pearl is back to his horror roots and it shows. The lighting is crisp and the style is classic. Although some of the daytime shots are a tad too contrasty, which is his trademark so I let it slide. Brian Tyler has been doing consistently good work on a lot of mediocre films but here he really revels in the fact he's standing on the shoulders of giants. The score combines the driving percussion of the Predator with eerie atmosphere of the Alien quite nicely. While I wish he came up with a more unique theme at least he didn't go bland and generic and stuck to what worked. The overall feel of the film is very much grounded in the style of the 80s. The gore is intense and gruesome but it's also kind of funny in a demented Sam Raimi kind of way. (That is if you find exploding pregnant bellies funny and seriously come on, who doesn't?) The Brothers Strause definitely wear their love of Aliens and Predator on their sleeve as there are numerous homages throughout the film. But they handle the tone way better than their predecessor knowing when to play it straight and when to not take things too seriously. The film looks twice as expensive as it's budget with a pretty epic ending and non-stop action in the third act. I'd definitely like to see what they could have pulled off with a bigger budget that was more in line with rest of the series. In the end its not the epic space opera that many wanted but it is a fun monster romp that exploits the Aliens on Earth storyline and offers the most interesting Predator character since the original.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

That would make the title the only thing that even makes sense with this movie. I didn't really mind the 1st AvP movie, although it had flaws. This was just flaws.The saddest thing, I feel like future Alien and/or Predator films are in the offing, and will be straight to DVD release.

1058,loke963,DIS-A-POINT-Meant!!! (Scandinavian reviewer),2,13 January 2008,"Just finished this movie, and was so disappointed (almost to the point of being angry) that I decided to rate it right away, hoping that other people won't go see it with the expectations I had.I actually liked Alien vs. Predator (2004). It only has a 5.4 average user rating, which I think is low. This movie actually has a 5.7 rating!!! I guess everyone connected to this movie (who could be ordered to, or has financial interests) gave this a 10. I can't fathom how it got that high a rating otherwise. I'm actually generous, giving it a 2, because of its sci-fi and action aspects (I'm a huge sci-fi fan).Luckily, quite a lot of people that are a bit more objective have rated it as well. If you read the reviews, you'll get a lot more accurate idea of how much this movie sucks.The movie has so many error/holes/disappointments that I don't know where to start. Fortunately for me, a lot of other people have expressed these for me, which cooled me down a bit.Arnold_is_Numero_Uno from Australia nails my biggest grievances pretty well. He's pretty harsh, and maybe takes this movie for more than it is, but I guess he was VERY disappointed as well.I've seen all the Alien and Predator movies, and liked them all in various degrees. This is by far the worst! People who think this is a great movie must be people whose tastes in things haven't evolved/matured yet. Hollywood's wet dream.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1059,neo_corvis,Much Better,9,29 December 2007,"After the watered down effort AvP was which had an interesting premise but poor delivery, I went into the cinema with an open mind. There will always be people who don't want the Alien or Predator series to be tarnished by numerous brainless sequels, I for one am one of those people. However I do feel that this film delivers some serious kick ass action and a decent story whilst tying up some ends.The predalien is a new twist to the series which to me is needed whilst the alien and predator are back doing what they do best, the fact that most action with both creatures is shot for real without CGI for the most part brings back some reality into the film series. I find it doesn't matter how 'real' something looks, your mind just tells you that it isn't real. The acting was something that I felt may let the story down as there are no real recognisable big names but they were believable in the roles they played. Being set in modern day Colorado I was fearing from the trailers a bit of a teen slasher flick vibe but it didn't turn into one. I thought too that being set where it's set it would just feel too far removed from its space roots to feel like an alien film (thank god for sewers). Although it is interesting to note, I mean who says Alien films have to be in space? The music was well written as there was recognisable themes running through the score for the predator and alien. The other thing in this film is that it didn't play safe and everyone was fair game quite a few chestbursting scenes that are far gorier than AvP. Now, spoiler or 2 ahead so be warned... The story picks up straight after AvP with the predalien chestburster wreaking havoc onboard the predator ship. I swear the aliens seem to grow faster in each flick however it was hinted that the predators used a juiced up queen in the pyramid in the original. This was so that laying of eggs, facehugger gestation and alien growth time are hastened so the hunt can begin sooner. The predator in the film seems to be the guy who ties up loose ends but ultimately he ends up over his head as the alien spawn gets larger and larger. There are some very cool new gadgets which I won't reveal but you can see a couple in the trailers. You also get a quick glimpse of the Predator homeworld which is awesome. The main predator's seat looks very much like the seat that the 'space jockey' is sitting in in the original Alien.Apart from the creatures, the main human characters in the film seem to be a woman marine very reminiscent of Ripley and to me thats not such a bad thing as I just didn't relate to the main female lead in the original AvP. There is also a main male lead who is trying to escape with his brother. To be honest I found the acting in the first flick to be annoying apart from Lance Henriksen who is an acting god and his demise in that film was totally unconvincing (Thanks Paul Anderson for giving the man such poor material to work with). The ending does tie up some of the Alien movie mythos nicely. In the future in the Alien films ""the company"" was Weyland Yutani, we met Weyland in AvP and in this you see the Yutani side and a suggestion as to how we accelerated our understanding of technology in the future.All in all I was pleasantly surprised, it wasn't a touch on the original films from either of the alien or pred films but it does fit in nicely to the genre and stands on it own feet bringing something new to the series whilst being faithful to its roots.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Dreadful scriptwriting, poor cinematography where you can barely make out anything that's on the screen due to it being too dark. This an absolute embarrassment of a film to the franchise.Don't believe the positive reviews, this isn't a horror in any sense. It's just killing after killing after killing for the government to nuke the entire town killing every single character that was introduced bar 4 characters & believe me, there was a lot of unnecessary characters introduced.Not to mention a pregnant woman and her unborn baby pumped full of Alien eggs to then have multiple chest bursters burst out of her which was also extremely unnecessary & very uncomfortable to watch.Avoid this film at all costs, unless you're doing a franchise run through then good luck.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1061,vladabuba,Rightful place in the series,9,2 June 2012,"First of all I'm huge Alien movie fan so there is no way that I did not critically looked at this movie. After marks set by Alien and Aliens, all movies afterwards including Alien 3 were gradually worse. Alien Resurrection was catastrophe and especially AVP 1 was insult to all us Alien fans. Lacking good story and believable characters, any sense and respect to Alien history and background, too depressive or cartoonish, to me it was just plain waste of time and energy. I thought that it was finished with Alien series. However when I saw that there would be one another movie in series I decided to give it a shot and watch it. As I had so much bad experience before, my enthusiasm was low and I was skeptic and pessimistic about film prospects. When I started watching movie however this has started to gradually positively change and by the end of film I was really pleased by movie experience, for the first time after Aliens movie! Story is interesting, characters are fine, action is furious, and Aliens, Predalien and Predator are tough and believable again. One of the best scenes are in the restaurant and in the hospital, level of horror and lighting is really masterfully planned. I need to mention and military ambush scene and town gathering that also give good atmosphere in film (did anyone wondered how defense would be organized by colonists on LV426?). Ending also leaves us with questions, like did someone in top government already know about xenomorph existence? Bad things: dialogs are sometimes dull and shallow, some action scenes could be executed better by my opinion.

1063,segall-1,"Made to entertain, not to change your life",8,12 March 2008,"OK, everyone who says this is a horrible movie needs to understand something. This is a movie, not a film. It is not meant to be something awe inspiring with intelligent writing; it's a predator versus a bunch of aliens. This movie is highly entertaining. You watch a lone Elder/Master Predator trying to contain an alien infestation in a mountain town. This isn't going to make you think when it ends, it's not going to change your life. It is going to entertain you for an hour and half or so. You people need to understand that every piece of film is made for different purposes. You can't compare something that obviously wasn't made to be complicated to something that was.Some 'spoilers' I've read that these aliens were altered genetically by the predators to have a lightning fast gestation rate; so that's the 'a wizard did it' explanation by the writers. There should have been more scenes on the Predator homeworld showing their culture, women, etc. The predator xenomorph (people are calling it the 'predalien', so I guess they should call the others humaliens) was hard to make out during some scenes because the lighting and the zoom on the camera. What else? The acting was to be expected, same with choice of characters. I would have liked it better if the Predator either recruited the humans or at least have tried to communicate with them.Basically, as I've said, this movie was made to be entertaining, and it is. If you are having a lot of people over who end up talking during movies, this is the one to watch. You're not going to miss anything important to the story and those kinds of people won't have their attentions wandering. It's also something you can watch by yourself, but make no mistake, if it's between this and a good one you haven't seen, watch the good one.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

I've seen all the Alien, Predator and damn-near every other sci-fi monster movie out there, and i'm telling you, this one is definitely one of the better ones, in terms of entertainment (for the record, my favorite 'Alien' movie is Resurrection, which i feel is very underrated).AVP2 was EXACTLY what part 1 should have been. It actually showed THE PREDATOR FIGHTING THE ALIENS, which is the WHOLE POINT. The human element IS cookie-cutter, which is precisely what it should be. This is not a movie about relationships or love or honor, it's two god damn alien species whaling on each other for our entertainment. There's no Ripley, there's no Arnold, the main characters ARE the Predator and the Aliens.Yes it's a bad movie, but it's a REALLY FUN AND ENTERTAINING bad movie.

The effects in this movie, in comparison the the entire Alien/Predator saga, are amazing. This in tandem with the camera work makes is a quality piece of work. The acting is noteworthy, believable, and genuine. There are many unknown actors here, but all pull through with a great performance.

It's Gothic sci-fi feeling with terror, suspense and raw fear in deep space. Most where generally well paced with a nice their own. I can put up with how what was considered ""the perfect killing machine"" now started to mutate with every new episode. I can almost endure the gestation period of chestbursters changing from what was once about 10 hours being reduced to about 20 to 60 minutes to speed up the movie plot. I even find witty one-liners by stereotypical gun-slinging characters often amusing. But once you insert a formulaic plot featuring college students and their girl friends running around USAville screaming, being eaten and being the protagonists you may as well watch any made for TV weekly slasher movie on the Sci-Fi channel. Any undead or mythical monster could have been put into this movie and it would have been just as rewarding.

1072,Haik-1,It could have been great,4,30 December 2007,"It could have been GREAT!!! What an amazing premise. An alien/predator on earth with tens of aliens running amok in small town. Why it FAILED: 1. The predator in the previous movies was always tactical. Not only was it superior in its strength but also in its wit. Hardly saw it in this movie, except for a couple of scenes. It felt like the aliens were smarter than him.2. It leaves NO time between when the time when the alien face-sitter breeds on the humans to when they erupt from their stomachs. In the first Alien it took some time before the alien burst open the guys stomach. It would have been amazing if we had seen the father/son hunters taken to hospital and there the aliens would take over right before they would have been discovered. Then the whole hospital would have been down. So anyone injured or hurt wouldn't have anywhere to go.3. The Predator lacked character.4. I didn't care about any of the characters. If the mother/daughter relationship was developed it would have been great. Then we would be voting for them throughout the whole movie. Instead they fell upon every cliché character in ANY movie and we followed a group of them for no reason. I didn't feel anything for them. I actually wanted to root for the Predator, but again, couldn't 5. The final battle was trying to go somewhere and pay an homage to previous movies, but again failed.

1074,muffinstripe,Not Great. Not Terrible.,5,29 January 2008,"OK. I didn't actually mind the first AVP because i grew up with the comics and the original alien/predator movies. I hated alien 3 because they killed off the characters i loved from aliens, was confused by resurrection and quite liked predator 2, but just the mere fact that there was a film with either of these two characters in it meant it was worth watching. I think you have to accept that as a fan it's never going to live up to your expectations. Some people criticised AVP because you saw too much of the predators, others thought you didn't see enough. In the first predator film they had a completely different creature lined up which simply didn't work so they shot around it until Stan Winston had come up with the fantastic creature we all know and love today. That's partly why you hardly see it in the first movie. But now we all know what it looks like so to make a film in which keeping it cloaked is the focus of suspense would be a little pointless. Same with the alien. Again, the first film kept it out of sight. The second lit the creature brilliantly so you never really get a 'proper' look at it at all, the third and fourth alien movies had the same problem as AVP because by then there were comics, a toy line and a whole host of merchandise so they developed new versions of the creature to give us something we hadn't seen before. And with resurrection we hated the hybrid! But imagine that film with just the same old aliens and it would be pretty dull. Or dull-er. I liked the way AVP nodded to the old films. The way the chains at the whaling station hang like alien tails, the satellite shot at the beginning, Lance Henriksen, weyland yutani. OK they messed with the incubation times and the fact that Predators only ever come when its hot, yet are happily walking around in the coldest place on earth! It felt like a predator movie in the Alien storyline. And obviously that didn't work for some people, but as a fan of both i think i got what they were trying to do. Same with AVPR. It feels like a predator movie. Lots of action. Dodgy dialogue. Great monster. But again they're beginning to bring the Alien storyline into it, which has a lot more depth to it than the predator one. I like the idea that Yutani and her people have an idea what was happening, but that the focus is on the predator, not the aliens. Predator 2 is all about the government trying to catch one for its technology and at the moment it seems they have no clue that the acid bleeding aliens exist. Great! I want to see more! Now my only problem with this film is the badly shot action sequences. If you're going to make a new addition to the ranks, then lets see it. If you're going to re-design the predator then lets see it! I didn't even notice that 'Wolf' had a missing mandible until i saw a picture of the action figure! These new films aren't really about the cast, they are about the monsters so lets see them. Also, i'm not a huge fan of CGI and didn't like the CG aliens in AVP. I think when you use puppets like the queen alien, or guys in suits it means you have to step up and work harder to make us believe in these creatures. Watch the extra features on predator or predator 2 DVDs to see how hard it was to make that cloaking effect! Or how James Cameron had to shoot round a crane arm that held the Alien queen. And yet we all agree those films are terrifying and hold up to this day. These new movies may not be masterpieces, but i got to see a predator kick ass and an annoying kid get a face-hugger makeover.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

If you're a fan of the Alien or Predator franchises, be prepared to get pretty peeved as this is not only a complete pile of excrement in itself, but also attempts to drag those franchises down into the gutter with it. I would imagine many of the sane people who watch this film will do so because they have a soft spot for Aliens or Predators. I'm more of a fan of the former and, as a youth, Aliens was my favourite film. Like me you'll probably know this isn't going to be a good film, but you'll be hoping against hope that it offers something to make the whole Alien universe a little more interesting. You'll be left sorely disappointed there.So much wrong with this thing I don't know where to start. The characters are paper thin and the attempts at development are laughable. They've attempted to give the film a sort of American teen movie undertone, which made me actually want most of the protagonists to die horribly. Luckily for me I did not watch this in the cinema, and so I skipped through parts of early scenes where you're encouraged to give a monkeys about something or someone.This film is also sacrilege to Alien fans as it rides roughshod over the principles of their reproduction (for starters). I won't spoil too much, but there is no Queen for one thing, and since there is no idea of any time lapse at any point, it appears we are to now entertain the idea that the aliens gestate in their host over a period of just an hour or two maximum. They then seem to grow to full size in another hour or so. Hence the town is filled with them in the space of a few hours.Half of the film is a montage of almost identical alien-tongue deaths. Over and over and over. In fact, the whole film is more or less a compilation of by-the-numbers sequences that you feel you've seen a million times before. It's all so predictable that at times it feels like there's little point watching. You might as well just sit and imagine how the people responsible for something like Final Destination 16 would interpret a cameo appearance of Aliens and Predators on an episode of Dawson's Creek.... and you'd probably come up with something more entertaining than this.The Aliens and Predator franchises now seem to have reached the 'Batman & Robin' stage of such utter destitution that the only way from now must be up. A far darker, more subtle interpretation of both is what the franchises have been crying out for since the initial trilogy, but instead we get turd like this as I would imagine that it's considered a safer bet with audiences.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1079,texasjdl,A real disappointment,2,25 December 2007,"I liked the first AvP, though it's not perfect. AvP:Requiem takes a turn for the worse, incorporating bland plot lines, poor action shots, and elements that make no sense. The movie's redeeming qualities are the throwback sound effects & score, and some of the visual effects.This movie picks up where that one left off, leaving behind all of the interesting story of the first one. It supplants those with banal story lines about the guy who just got out of jail, his brother who gets bullied and likes the bully's girlfriend, and a bunch of other trite clichés. Unfortunately, the movies spends 20-30 minutes setting up all of these stories and almost makes you forget that you're watching a Predator or Alien movie.The action sequences in the movie are terrible; the movie is too dark and shot too closely to make sense of any of the action sequences. While watching the movie, I repeatedly had difficulty determining whether it was an alien, or the alien-predator cross-breed in a shot; during the fight sequences, it was really hard to determine what was going on.**Spoilers below here**In addition, the alien that pops out of the predator at the beginning is a cross-breed, part predator, part alien. I was willing to let this slide at the end of the first AvP, but continuing that in this movie made me think about it further. Why would it be a cross-breed? The aliens do not seem to be cross-breeds when they pop out of humans. This does not make sense to me.OK, never mind that point. The predators are still in earth's orbit when the predator-alien creature kills the predators on board and crashes the ship. What kind of impossible growth rate does that indicate (this was a problem AvP had, too)? OK, never mind that, too. After the aliens are let loose on this little town in Colorado, they immediately infest the place with numbers that are unsupported by the number of larvae that were on the predator's ship. Huh? They only showed a half-dozen or so on the alien ship.Then, the predator-alien can lay larvae in pregnant women. Huh? Then, they're not even cross-breeds, they're just the regular aliens, it looks like. Huh again. I am bored of all of the plot holes.What I did like about this movie were the sound effects and score elements that were pulled from Aliens and Predator. Those movies remain the best movies in the franchises, and it was nice to hear the same sound effects and score elements. Also, the visual effects when the camera ""is"" the predator were also reminiscent of the first movie.Overall, though, this movie was a disappointment. I went to the first show on Christmas Day; I should have stayed home.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1080,kreemkrackered,Not bad at all,7,6 January 2008,"I quite enjoyed this film - the idea of the original predator craft crashing back to earth and it all kicking off again is a nice follow-on from the previous film in which the predator was impregnated and ultimately killed as a result of it's fight with the queen alien.Whilst sometimes the film does resemble a teen horror slasher as the main characters are predominately teenagers, the single predator goes through the aliens with great skill and the fight scenes are (whilst quite dark and hard to make out) fairly well done.For the most, the film revolves around the (young) residents of a mountain town running around like headless chickens, trying to avoid being torn up by rampaging aliens and the cross-fire of the frustrated predator who has some pretty sweet weapons, and the obvious double-crossing military cliché is in there for good measure.Good for wasting an hour of your life - harmless scifi slasher with a decent plot but weak storyline and cast.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1081,mikeyb-7,I liked it,9,20 January 2008,"I heard that it was crap so I was pleasantly surprised that the corny dialog didn't get in the way of an overall fun movie. And enough wasn't explained in the movie which was a nice touch. However it did feel like a TV episode, but the way TV is going there is nothing wrong with that. The three screaming Japanese girls sitting next to me added to the experience as well.I kept expecting Arnie to turn up though when the bongo drums started playing. I thought that was to do with the jungle theme of the first predator movie not the Predators Ipod selection.I think some people are being too harsh on this movie. I think those people should go and make their own version. Its what these guys did when they didn't like the first one.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

First off, this in no way compares to AVP the first Alien/Predator movie. It doesn't even compare to any of the Aliens or Predators on their own. It is a cheesy B movie with extremely poor lighting. Most of the time I was watching a black screen because the lighting was so poor. Was this an attempt to make the movie scary?It didn't work for me. I have seen better movies made on a home video recorder. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1083,sho_nuff101,avp: d.o.a.,2,9 January 2008,"The latest installment in the two titular franchises may just be the most witless and stupid of them all. I hated the original AVP (2004). I thought it was sloppy, disorganized, lacked any sort of tension or suspense, and had a fatal lack of atmosphere. Add to this a cast of cardboard cutouts, set to the rhythms of an absolutely ridiculous plot, and you've got yourself one of the lamest exercises in big budget studio film-making in recent memory.Until now.The Brothers Strause have managed to redeem their ill-fated predecessor (Mr. P. W. S. Anderson) by making a film so devoid of imagination, so flawed in it's pacing, so lacking in craft, so dull, so cruel, that I'm not sure that this film can be reviewed properly. The original AVP was, in spite of itself, still an ""attempt"" at a movie. AVP:R is more like a music video without the music dubbed in, or watching someone else play a video game. It felt like one long trailer for the movie that we were supposed to be seeing. Things just tended to ""happen"" and I really couldn't tell how or why (i.e. when the National Guard shows up, the total destruction of the population of the town, Aliens seemingly coming out of the nowhere--it all just *happens*). I should state somewhere in here that I'm a big fan of the first 3 Alien films and of Predator (meh, and even Predator 2). I think those movies own the rights to the genre, and are excellent proof that a film can be a popcorn, sci-fi flick, and still have a decent story, good acting/characters, and more than one dimension. Plot and pacing are not mutually exclusive to action and special effects. If you don't know that or don't believe that (like the makers of this film seem not to) then this film will be a hard lesson for you.I don't have the will to give each aspect of this film it's proper attention so, quickly, I thought the characters were like C-grade horror movie fodder, the acting was akin to Saved by the Bell (the College Years, not the first seasons), the effects were competent, but over-relied upon, the plot was insulting and some of the violence was so egregious as to border on offensive--shamelessly included to give the movie some ""edge"" with the brainless teenage boy crowd it was *depending* on showing up to watch it. It really burns that someone like Shane Solerno gets to have a job in Hollywood and write scripts for movies with Aliens and Predators in them. Personally, I think he'd be out of his league running spell-checks on airplane vomit bag instructions. Life isn't fair, kids.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1084,WeedWhacka,What a blast.,9,29 December 2007,"I don't know why everybody is bashing the movie so hard.Yeah, sure its not up there with ridley scott or james cameron's version but it sure as hell beats the *beep* out of avp1 and aliens4.In some parts I felt like I was watching a re enacting of aliens (the familiar scenes and background musics while they rode the tank and the getaway from the nukes)I've been a alien fan since i first seen alien back in the 70's as a kid. I had already given up on seeing a alien (/predator) movie that would really entertain me.The movie was not without flaws, and im not talking about a weak plot (dude, its aliens vs predator not shindlers list).OK, the teenage drama stuff was kind of unnecessary but it didn't bother me that much.What really annoyed me was the way to close up shots during the action scenes, combined with the fast movement and the plentiful darkness i had a hard time recognizing what was going on at some points.*beep* that bourne legacy camera and cutting style (it totally ruins the action!) I want to see what is happening and don't want to guess who just got what, where.I understand the film makers wanted to avoid showing the creatures too clearly to make them more frightening, that's all right. But It was just too dark at times.All in all a good movie, compared to what we have been fed in the past since aliens (alien3 was OK but NO GUNS WTF?!?)I would happily buy a ticket for avp3 if they decide to continue the story where avp2 ended. As i said, its a action/scifi/monster flick and it does its job good. So please don't look for shindlers list, you wont find it here.I do hope they are going to lend a bit more from the avp comics, that would be so awesome. This part was a nice start.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1085,colonial-marines,this film was fantastic and deserves more applaud,10,20 January 2008,"a reviewer earlier being a simpleton said why if the predator was covering his tracks why did he skin a guy. its because he's a predator. and the blue liquid was to get rid of alien traces, the predator killed that guy and skinned him because he wasn't involved with the aliens....back on track admittedly the film was dark but so was alien, aliens, alien 3 and alien resurrection, the predator was on top form he moved and killed like the bad-ass predator that faced Arnie, the aliens were as terrifying as the other films, the actors and characters where impressive i felt i was there and knew them, they're being reviewed badly because its not a Shakespearian script or cast, but for me it was perfect, all through the film i didn't want Kelly, Dallas or Ricky to get killed, but at the same time wanted dale to get killed horribly, the seen in the hospital were Jesse meets shuriken was kick ass, then Ricky goes postal on a predator, anyway this film is everything i wanted in an aliens movie, my review this film is as good as aliens",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1086,jed_jacobs,Great film,8,26 December 2007,I really like this film over the first AvP. This one had a lot darker feel like the original movies did. I see a lot of people are complaining about the fact that there is only one Predator vs 100 Aliens but that's how the Predator's take care of things. In the first AvP movie those Predator's were young hunter's getting their right of passage. In the AvP:R they send a badass trained Predator that can take care of business. Why send a lot of Predators when one can take care of the job. Even though they didn't have a lot of big named actors this movie wasn't made to win a Oscar or rely on one person. This movie is all about the Aliens vs the Predators they are the main stars. The other people are just cannon fodder. If you like the franchise and you want to see some great Aliens and Predator action then go and watch this film,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1087,henric32,I didn't want to remember Alien vs Predator like this,1,21 January 2008,"If this is the last film about Alien vs Predator this low budget ordinary horror movie have spoiled the Alien Predator legacy The film is very dark. This because of the low budget obviously. Many scenes are very messy and indistinct. The acting is as in all low-budget horror movies, you can guess. The plot make no sense and the director just wanted as many monsters in the little city as possibly. Then the killing starts and the blood floats. There Is only one goal in this movie, to do as much killing as possible. I,m very very disappointed. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. Save your money!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1088,jiggydog3000,Compared to the new The Predator movie this movie is genious,10,8 August 2020,"This movie gets a lot of hate that I will never understand. I don't know what people are looking for when it comes to these movies, they are so judgmental and hateful. I love this movie due to its use of the Aliens and Predator. The costume designs are tight, the Alien Predator hybrid is so dope I can't even. The only thing I never understood about AvP or this one is how fast the aliens grow. Not a complaint it just doesn't make sense. But the action in this film is tight, when the predator accidentally kills the hot blonde is one of the best scenes in a slasher film. The pool scene is creepy and the hospital scene is so disturbing its great. People complain about it being too dark, but then people also complain about movies when you can see the monster and it's no longer scary. AVP: Requiem is a great film and I'm sad we never got more of these. Anyone who hates this and likes The Predator is an idiot.

1089,mosabouria,Worst Movie Ever.,1,26 December 2007,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen, Right next to 'Cabin Fever'. Everything about this movie was terrible, boring, and just plain random. As soon as the movie started, it went down hill. I cannot believe the thought process that went into making this fill. The fight scenes w/ the Alien-predator were to short, the acting was the worst I have seen. Way to many characters with not enough background information. There was plenty of gore and blood, but that does NOT make up for how bad this film is. I am happy to say, that I bought tickets to see 'Kite Runner' but when I got there, there was no room to sit down, so I found the theater that was playing AVP-R and went in. Pleas, do yourself a favor and 'do not' see this movie.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1090,Joe_ollie,What a mess!,4,22 January 2008,"When Aliens vs Predator 1 was released there was a lot of hype around the title, fans were excited as a battle between two A-list classic sci-fi villains seemed like a dream come true However the film was seen to be a disappointment due to poor execution (script writing, camera angles and shots) etc. The same fate befalls is the second instalment of the franchise.Anyone who is a fan of either the aliens or predator films like myself, will most probably feel saddened when the credits roll.To put things into perspective, take an unoriginal plot, a director with a love for extremely low brightness levels, a couple of classic antagonists, a large splash of gore, mix it all together and you have the recipe for Aliens vs. Predator- Requiem.The plot doesn't really kick off at any point; leaving the viewer waiting for something interesting to happen which unfortunately never occurs. It is also filled with plot holes and contradicts itself on a few occasions, an example being that the predator uses a blue liquid to dissolve evidence so that the humans will be none the wiser but then happily kills a human he sees spying on him, skins him and leaves him to hang upside down. This then alerts the authorities. Clever Boy!Another issue with the predator is that it is seen as the protagonist in some ways, as the good guy, the day saver. If you've watched predator 1 and 2 you'll know he clearly fails in the hero category. I know alien vs. predator one revamped the species lore but it feels as if the director throws in a few predator-human kills to try and show the viewer that the predator is still not your friendly alien like E.T.The first film portrays the predators as excellent skilled hunters where they bred aliens as game and hunted them in mass numbers but as soon as the hybrid emerges it outclasses the predators in strength, stealth and dexterity. Predator lore tells that underneath its armour and without its weaponry it has similar strength to a human, so really as the hybrid doesn't use any of the predator technology, shouldn't the predator with his experience be able to dispatch the hybrid with relative ease? My main disappointment with this film however was the brightness levels. The film is almost all shot in the nighttime, which is OK but the brightness levels are very low making it hard to see detail on the aliens/hybrid and sometimes the predator, although he suffered from this much less. It leaves you wondering if the director deliberately did this to hide poorly made puppets from being seen in their full glory.This film has a fair amount of blood; mutilations etc so gore lovers will not feel disappointed here.Overall if the aliens/predators were not present in this film it would of got lower score, their presence is what made me give it a 4. It's not a great movie, not a good move for the franchise and a bit of a disappointment.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1091,Dele_etc,Not as bad as everyone says,7,7 February 2008,"I like the Alien and Predator films, the first Alien versus Predator was a huge disappointment, though I feel this is what the 1st one should have been. Yes, this film is senseless, and requires no brain power at all, but then, which Alien or predator films did? Everyone here is shooting this film down when I'm sure we've all seen far far worse - if you see this expecting Oscar worthy performances, then prepare for a big let down, if you want to see the Predator take on Aliens in good solid fights, then this is for you.Naturally, there's a list of plot holes, much less than the 1st film but plot holes all the same. Namely, the very short gestation period for the Aliens - all Aliens seem to go from implantation to adulthood in mere minutes, and when does an Alien have the ability to impregnate multiple embryos without a face hugger?!? This aspect really annoyed me.The subplots and actors also weren't that bad. I've seen films with wet high school characters that just make me want to puke, I could at least stomach these. Thank goodness there was no 'love story' subplot, at least it has that saving grace.What did it for me was the formidable Predator. Let's get this straight, the Predator is a bad-ass warrior who cannot be killed easily, the 1st film didn't acknowledge this, but this film portrays it perfectly. The Predator goes from fight to fight, killing the Aliens with a different technique, this is what made the film worth watching and enjoyable. I read all the low scores on this site and was dreading watching AVPR, in the end I had a really good time. If you love the Alien/Predator franchise, then this film does it justice, and if you don't, well, stay far away.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1092,cathsstewart,Did anyone else notice that...,6,18 July 2021,"I really enjoyed this sequel, but a major plot issue kept yelling at me!Why was the Alien (and Predalien) blood suddenly NOT acidic???With all those elaborate and bloody fight scenes, we were treated to trails of the Predator's glow-in-the-dark blood, gallons of human blood, and satisfying amounts of Alien blood; but the latter somehow wasn't an acid anymore. That kind of took me out of the perspective of the Alien/Predator universe and made me see the movie from an outside perspective. It's one of the central plot devices from all the other films in the series! Aliens have acid for blood and are ""generally unpleasant.""I'm confident that I wasn't alone in noticing this glaring omission.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1093,Smith25,An insult.,1,18 July 2008,"Let me start off by saying that there is absolutely NOTHING for Alien fans in this movie, not a god damn thing. If you wanted to see Aliens in this movie, look somewhere else because they just aren't in this movie. The first AVP may not have been perfect but after you see this POS, you will start seeing it in a whole new light. This movie has so many problems such as Directing, the camera work is crappy and the movie is so dark you can hardly see what's going on. The acting is beyond poor, it's like I was watching an episode of the OC. The setting was terrible; Aliens do not belong in a town that looks like something out of Dawson's Creek. But above all, the worst part of this movie is the horrible Bias for the predators in this movie. The Strause brothers have made statements like ""How can anyone root for the aliens?"" and ""You can relate to the predators more"" in other words they basically told the whole Alien fan base to get lost. So throughout the movie, instead of getting the 8 foot tall, strong aliens we all grew up with (the REAL aliens), we get a bunch of little 3 foot tall weak bugs for ONE predator(that's right just ONE)to kill effortlessly. Now to say that the Strause brothers humiliated the aliens would be an understatement. They did their best to make sure that no one could take the aliens seriously ever again. they had the predator throw them around like rag dolls, holding them back like screaming punks with little effort,throwing them through shoe shelves, shrugging them off his shoulder, throwing them to the ground and punching them in the face, crushing their heads as easy as beer cans with his foot. Anyone who has seen AVP or any other alien movie would know that this is all complete bull crap.This movie was nothing but two predator fan boys trying to make it clear that predators are better than aliens in every way, but they fail miserably because the REAL aliens are nowhere to be seen in this movie.Had the real aliens been in this movie the predator would have been killed the first time he fought them.So my message to alien fans is this: ""Walk away, there's nothing for you here.""",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1094,call_me_grudge,"Brilliant, Mind-Bending Storytelling",2,31 December 2007,"From what I understand, Fox was embarrassed they released a PG-13 Alien/Predator movie not so long ago. It was not well received by any means.Not exactly sure where to go next, seeing as they thought Anderson was the best director for the franchise and they had produced a true sci-fi gem, Fox turned to it's small, but knowledgeable group of monkeys for answers.These monkeys were by no means veterans of writing sci-fi flicks, but had seen Burton's Planet of the Apes remake and House of the Dead. Their first task: hire actors. Fox gave them a reasonable budget but the monkeys wanted to save the money. They hired fifteen TV actors shortly after.Now, the script. The monkeys wanted to save more of the budget so they wrote the movie themselves. Leaving out important aspects of the two franchises was the easy part. Thinking of great new lines for the general audience to remember years down the line - that was more difficult. They butted heads awhile and came up with a truly award-winning screenplay equipped with cliché characters, idiotic decisions an gaping plot holes.Fox was pleased thus far with the results but wanted to see what was to become of the centerpieces to the film - the aliens and predators. The monkeys again wanted to save money in the budget so they decided to trash the great robotics used in the otherwise terrible AvP original and go with the man-in-the-suit Alien seen in the old films. The actors playing the aliens had trouble fitting into the suits as they weren't properly sized by the monkeys so they jiggled their plastic heads throughout the film with honor. As for the predators, the monkeys decided one predator was enough this time around (again, saving budget) to fight the hordes of aliens that seemingly come out of nowhere. But what about the effects, you ask? Come on now, people. They may be monkeys but they clearly knew CGI would play a key role in the film. Without diving into the budget, the monkeys used a standard Final Cut program and cut and pasted some very nice fire and spark effects throughout. Putting red and green filters over the camera lens provided some excellent Predator visions.The setting was something the monkeys thought long and hard about. If this was to be on Earth, in Colorado of all places, they needed to make it realistic. This was where they admitted they might have made a mistake. See, the monkeys didn't have proper training in this department so they thought turning the lights off in the city and having the movie play out in the dead of night and in the rain was the right thing to do. They simply forgot people like to see the creatures instead of looking at shadows and rain the whole film. To add insult to injury, the monkeys accidentally filmed all the fight scenes incredibly close so no one could see what was fighting or who it was. But again, rookie mistake.The rating. Fox told the monkeys to make the movie R-rated. That was easy. Without showing how many of the injuries or deaths actually happened, the monkeys made a habit of showing the carnage after the fact. It was simple: the viewers got the gore they desired and the monkeys didn't have to film the majority of action shots involving that violence.Some of the actors originally had questions concerning the screenplay. Why does a blue liquid the Predator has endless amounts of magically disintegrate whatever he wants it to and nothing more than that? Why is an ex-convict driving around in a police car the entire movie? Why did the monkeys forget to show a full body shot of the Aliens? Why does a clock play a more memorable role than any of the main characters? The list of questions just kept growing but the monkeys ignored them and finished their masterpiece. Fox was thrilled with their work. So thrilled that they opened the movie nationwide on Christmas Day and even spent a few bucks advertising it the week before it came out. The monkeys had successfully made another installment in these cherished franchises.But some ask, what ever happened to the budget the monkeys forgot to use? They put it towards their next film: Aliens vs. Predator vs. Hulk Hogan. They knew the general public would be upset with the title but they have since released this statement:""To the people- do not worry about our upcoming film. It will be rated R and will have violence.""And everyone lived happily ever after. The end.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1095,Neamhshuntasach,An action movie and nothing more,7,22 January 2008,Having been a huge fan of the original Predator and Alien movies there are aspects of the Alien vs Predator franchise that disappointed me. But with that said i thoroughly enjoyed them. It is difficult to repeat or better a classic. And plus it's a different era these days. Everything looks more flashy.Don't let any of the negative reviews or comments slating this movie put you off going. It is an entertaining action movie with a decent amount of gore and a few swear words. There is a high enough body count and the action is pretty fast paced. I don't know what people are expecting from a movie about a Predator fighting an Alien and a few humans stuck in the middle. It will entertain you for 90 minutes and i got my monies worth. I'll go see No country for old men or Michael Clayton if i want to watch plot heavy serious movies. And you should do the same.,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1096,troy-marten,What even...,1,5 January 2015,"It'll be a day in hell by the time we get a worthy AVP movie. The first one was okayish in that it tried to be smart with its Storytelling, and reasoning why the Aliens and Predators fought. But even then, it was disappointing.Sadly, this one does not try to do anything other than insult you.I know I'm late in reviewing this movie, but I just had to do one. It's just so bad. In fact, it's absolutely terrible, in so many ways...as you may have seen by most people who reviewed this movie.Since anyone should know the plot right now, I'll just point out why I thought this...thing, was bad.1. The Predator: I'm suppose to believe that this Predator is a great hunter and almost like an Elder from the comics, yet is almost always spotted by humans, and tossed around like a rag-doll by a PredAlien, when Elders are suppose to be the best of the best who can pretty solo entire alien hives? No. Even the Young-Bloods from the first movie were better then this Predator.2. The Setting: As we know, Aliens are a thing of the future, crawling around Spaceships and Stations, fighting futuristic soldiers with all kinds of guns. The point of the Alien movies is to make sure they don't make it to earth. So, just like the first movie, them being on Earth makes zero sense, and is insulting towards the Alien Franchise. Predators are always on Earth in the present, so you'd think ""Gee, what's the complaint?"". The fact that it's in some small American town with problems and thinking like the sort you get in some Friday the 13th movie...this is ALIENS and PREDATOR, not Jason Voorhees. We want to see the titans go at one another, not a bunch of annoying teenagers run around and complain.The other problems can easily be seen via other people. If you love the Alien and Predator movies, don't watch this, unless you want to suffer brain damage.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1097,raptor5105,"Go see it for the action and gore, but not the acting...",10,24 December 2007,"I just got home from screening AVP-R and I must say I am disappointed at some things, but overall I enjoyed it.The movie, which has a short runtime, tries to pack most of the action into the last half of the movie. Yes, there are some deaths in the first half, but there is no sense of direction. We see girlfriend issues, people talking about life being hard, blah, blah, blah It just doesn't make you feel for the humans. But who cares about that right? We all want to see gore and action, which I'm glad to say is the movie's strong point.I have to admit, the action sequences in this movie have topped the first one by a long shot, but if you've seen the red-band trailer, then you already know what's going to happen before it occurs on-screen. This is what made this aspect of the film a little disappointing, but it wasn't enough to ruin or take away from the experience. That was left to the acting There are only two characters that are even worth paying attention to, because all the rest of them just stand there and say ""Are you okay?"", or, ""Something's wrong here"" I mean, come on, that's just ridiculous. I hate to say it, but there are some better dialogue sequences in the first AVP film. The wooden dialogue, just like the little bit of background on each character, hinders the likability factor for the humans. I didn't really care if they succeeded.But that really doesn't matter does it? They just stand in the way of the main attraction. Most of us just want to see the Predator and the Aliens fighting it out, and hopefully one of them will emerge victorious right? I have to say it delivers on the promise of action, but if you're looking for resolution, then you won't find it here. It won't leave anyone arguing who won the battle royal (like the first film), and once again, if you have seen the red-band trailer then you can almost guess what happens at the end ten minutes before you get there.In all, this movie was fun. Not great, but it was worth watching. If you're a fan of either series, you'll enjoy it. Just look past the wooden acting and watch it for its true purpose; two alien species battling it out.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1098,rdnotty,Take a second look...,9,9 March 2010,"Like many, I was very disappointed with the first AVP film. It had so much potential and fell flat. A lot of people don't think that the 'Alien' and 'Predator' series should mesh but the characters work so well on screen together. Both series had gone as far as they can go on their own and needed to take the next step. What I mean by this is - How many times can we see Ripley battling aliens or the action star of the week battling a predator? It has been done to death. The only logical choice is to combine them. Now, I am not a big fan of spin-offs or ""versus"" movies (Freddy vs. Jason was absolutely terrible), but these sci-fi monsters feel right in the same sci-fi universe. The first AVP movie didn't have the ""edge"" that the 'Alien' and 'Predator' series had. The concept was cool but the overall look and feel of the film was not right.Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem showed so much potential and, upon my first viewing in theaters, didn't deliver. I had the same problems with it that everyone else did: the acting was not great, the writing was not great, the action scenes were choppy and badly edited, blah, blah, etc. I have recently had a nostalgic hair up my tail and wanted to revisit the good sci-fi/horror films of the last few decades and watched the entire 'Alien' and 'Predator' franchises. After that, I watched the cross-over films. AVP still disappointed but after watching the unrated director's cut of 'Requiem' I found myself quite impressed the second time around. The footage put back into the film was actually quite substantial and made the flow of the movie much better. Even little scenes of characters running to a new location filled in the gap and plot-hole questions of ""When the hell did they get there?"" The added footage of the Predator tracking and detecting made the movie feel like it centered on him and his mission, making it a better film. Some of the acting and dialogue was not the greatest but some of the acting and dialogue in James Cameron's 'Aliens' (one of the, if not the best film in the series)was not that great either. The films are about the monsters and the melodrama that follows. I truly believe that the film is worth a second look and is a worthy follow up to the franchises. It isn't trying to be anything more than what it is(like the films in the series that proceeded it), a fun monster movie. Take a second look...",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1099,v312ym34n,Too Bad,3,24 September 2008,"It's a bad sign when I buy a title and I can't watch it through in one sitting. It's a very bad sign when it's an action/sci-fi movie and it takes me three different sessions to get to the end.The worst part of the movie is that it's boring. Why is it boring? Because there are too many characters who are all badly written and acted out in uninspired ways, and the point of view shifts in between them too quickly for the suspense to build up in between the violent encounters with the beasties.This is in stark contrast with the first Alien and the first Predator movies, where there were only a small number of main characters and there was little bouncing around of point of view.And that's another thing - too much of the movie happened in the dark. It would have been a lot better if it had taken a whole day from morning to night for the main guys to go through their plot instead of everything happening at night - you can't appreciate the special effects.Again - contrast this junk with the first Alien and the first Predator movies. Predator happened almost entirely during the day, and Alien had long stretches happening in eerily lit corridors of the big spaceship - there's a big difference between eerie lighting and the murky mess in AVP2.I've seen all the Alien and Predator movies and this is the worst by far.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Why? Here's my reasoning. This film has no special meaning. There's no plot. If you expected either of those from this film, then you watched the film wrong. It's just a big, dumb, slasher action film and it knows it. You'll probably laugh at parts, cheer when the girl crush gets a predator blade in the chest, or be totally smashed by the drinking game we came up with. 1) Sip every time the predator kills an Alien. 2) Sip every time the Aliens kill a human (on or off scene). 3) Take a shot during the cringy human ""emotional connection"" scenes. 4) Chug during the Aliens battle with the National Guard. 5) If you suspect a character will do a dumb thing and/or be killed, you must announce it then promptly take a shot. 6) Pour a little out of your cup into a separate cup for when the bullies die, then pass the cup around until it's empty.

All I wanted was an amazing movie where Aliens fight Predators (plural) with a decent plot. but NO.What do we get--- 1 predator, many aliens, but a plot that was worst than teeny bopper movies. I think a ferret poops better plots.I hope the writers never get another job again and FOX knows they have absolutely killed an amazing thing from happening. What idiot even cleared this camel crap to be shown to the public. Fight scenes are not that bad, should have been way better, some even make you feel like smiling for a bit, then anything plot wise makes you wanna pluck your eyes out. It is such an abomination that FOX should be the first studio in history to apologize to the public for single handedly creating and destroying an amazing franchise.ALIEN and ALIENS were genre defining movies with A list directors and talent. Predator had Arnold, Jesse and Apollo Creed. People were not expecting anything of that caliber but something one could watch. A movies that gave us our two favorite movie monsters battling it out, and they screwed it up again.FOX... hand the franchises of to Paramount, WB, SONY... anyone that doesn't suck and give up.

1102,wildsidepress,Not quite as bad as the critics say,4,27 December 2007,"Audiences seem to be divided as to the merits of this movie, with few falling in the middle (as I do). I give it a 4 stars out of 10, but I may raise my rating if a better director's cut comes along. And I do think there might be another (and much longer) cut in the works.The movie feels as though a lot of character-building stuff got cut to keep the action moving. Transitions are abrupt. Characters have ""histories"" (such as Dallas) that we never find out much about, but other characters seem to know.On the other hand, most of the secondary characters are portrayed by bad actors. At one point or another, every human in the film gets a deer-in-the-headlights, oh-my-God-the-camera-is-pointed-at-me-what-do-I-do-now expression. Toward the end, the hero asks two guys if they're stoned. No, just bad actors!So perhaps the movie was strengthened by trimming dialog to focus more on creatures and effects...because the aliens and the predator are what saves this movie from being another Ultraviolet. (That's now the benchmark my friends and I use to determine a really, really bad movie. And this one isn't another Ultraviolet.) Worth seeing? Yes the effects are great.

Today it is also loosely applied by IRC, BBS, and online gaming users to anyone perceived to be contemptible. In general, the term has come to describe someone who is intentionally ignorant of how things work.The term is derived from lame. A lamer is widely understood to be the antithesis of a hacker. While a hacker strives to understand the mechanisms behind what he uses, even when such extended knowledge would have no practical value, a lamer only cares to learn the bare minimum necessary to operate the device in the way originally intended. Thus, a lamer is usually indistinguishable from someone who is too lame to understand why something works even if they wanted to.

1105,MagnumFrenzy,Horrible,3,28 December 2007,"I was excited when I heard that AVP:R was coming out. I was disappointed with the first film and was hoping that this movie would at least be better than it.The movie starts with a scene where the PredAlien is born. It attacks another Predator and then the Predator ship crashes on Earth. All of the Aliens escape.There's a plot about two brothers, there's a plot about a mother in the army, there's a sideplot of the two brothers plot involving bullies... there are several different plots in this movie. This is a great idea, but it wasn't executed very well.The fight scenes were confusing and all over the place. I couldn't tell what was going on half the time. I think it says something about a film when a character in the movie exclaims, ""That's crazy! The government wouldn't lie to us!"" and then half the theater starts laughing.There were a few memorable scenes, like when two guy's heads get blown off, but there were also a few needlessly gory and/or gross scenes. One of these is when the alien goes into a hospital and plants several facehuggers inside a pregnant woman. I never knew that aliens could do that anyway; maybe it was the Predlaien, I'm not even sure.Oh yeah, and the ending. I have no idea what that's about. I won't give anything away, but I'll say that it's kind of confusing and it can be interpreted many different ways.This movie is a complete disaster. Just see the original 'Alien' and 'Predator' series', don't waste your money on this. The fight scenes are confusing, it is too confusing at times, and I don't get the ending.

And that is what this movie delivers in amazing quantities, I mean, its one hell of a big monster movie, with lots of gore and guts, no political correctness, its the simplest of stories, no greedy corporation subtext, or man vs. nature metaphors, or war is bad, like they tried to imply on the original movies (I mean Alien, Aliens and Predator 1 of course, the rest are just like this one, easy money movies).For those of you who want to see one bad ass Alien and predator this is the movie for you, there are lot of no stop there kills, some things that really push the barrier on what can be shown on a studio movie, and a R rating means (Very 80's style of action in this regard). I really can't imagine what an unrated version for this movie will be like, There are really some shocking moments.If you want some profound background and really well rounded characters, this definitely its NOT the movie for you, people in this movie are really nothing more than food and bait.

1110,rooman-37559,An Underrated Film,5,24 September 2016,"After I viewed the first movie a few years ago I was actually pretty impressed with AVP: Alien vs Predator. I think it was creative, had a decent script and amazing action scenes. So that being said I kept an open mind when I watched AVP-R. I'm probably one of the few in the world who thinks that AVP-R was just slightly better that the first movie. I enjoyed them both, but I liked the sequel just a little more entertaining.Sure, there was better acting in AVP than in this one, but let's be honest here, we're not watching it for them. We're watching it to see a good old showdown between Aliens and Predators. And that's one thing I enjoyed about AVP-R: it is full of Alien vs Predator action. I will admit I was disappointed that the Aliens weren't as intelligent as in the first AVP but then again, this Predator is also a Veteran and he's very good so I don't mind how easy it is for him to kill them.A common complaint that I've noticed on other reviews is that the lighting is horrible and nothing can be seen. But I feel as if they're over exaggerating a little. I own both the theatrical and unrated cut of this movie on standard DVD and I could see the film clearly. So it may just be a brightness issue on the TV. I think it's a pretty creative choice for the production team to make the lighting dark. It fits the tone of the movie well. Another complaint is that there was only one Predator. Now maybe it would be better if there had been three for this situation but I think by just having one made the movie slightly more traditional in terms of Predator. Before AVP came out, there was always just one Predator. So for there to be only one, I felt like it was more traditional People probably went had their mind set on not liking the movie and that's exactly what happened because they had already decided that it wasn't gonna be any good. But if you watch AVP-R with an open mind, you might just get and enjoyable, mindless, action- packed flick.The direction of the movie was a little rough, but this movie still manages to hold its own when you compare it to AVP. And it's definitely more entertaining than Alien 3. And it was more engaging. I was more interested in what was happening in AVP-R than I was in Alien 3. The story of the movie is what really held my attention. My attention was caught just for being titled AVP. The story is where the clincher took hold. After a Hybrid of Alien and Predator causes an Alien infestation, a lone Predator shows up on Earth to clean up the mess. An Alien/Predator hybrid was really cool to me. And the final fight between Wolf and that Hybrid was pretty awesome.Overall I think that this movie was a little better and more enjoyable than the first AVP. They were both entertaining enough to watch again. If people watched it with an open mind, I think that AVP-R would have a better reception.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1111,DJ_Kalee,Reminiscent of Alien films of the Past,10,28 December 2007,"AVP 2: Requiem is worlds over better than the first AVP encounter. It is very reminiscent to Aliens. The only problem I had with the film is that it was shot a little to dark. What I mean is that the lighting of the film could have been a little better. The plot is great, and the action scenes are amazing. The film has some very disturbing images in it, and some amazing gore. I think they've finally nailed a great match-up with the species.We see some great Predator actions that have been seen in the comics, and the Predalien which was great.

I actually liked the first AVP 100 times better than this crap. If Hollywood wants to cash in on the Alien and Predator franchise please do so with some class. It was almost comical in one scene where the camera moves in on an actress and you already know what she's gonna say, something to the fact of ""where not gonna make it are we"" ?

Right now I am writing a comment because I want people to save their money and use that saved money to rent or buy the originals. Where can I begin? I've read the trivia, and one of them said that the filmmakers nicknamed the Predator, Wolf, because he is some kind of a ""cleaner"", who comes to Earth to clean up the mess and hide the evidence. OK, that's fair enough. Then why the hell does the Predator kill and skin that innocent police officer and then hang him on the tree? Colin and Greg Strause have no clue what film-making is about. They are horrible directors. Not only that, but then we get a bunch of teenagers mixed in, who are from Colorado. At least they should've added a side story where they argue about whether going skiing or snow boarding, instead of a teenage, jealous love story. But then here is the best part. The end of the movie. ""People are not ready for this kind of technology."" Regarding the Predator weapon. Then how the hell does one of the main characters figure out how to use it in a matter of seconds??? See, I even forgot his name. Because I didn't give a crap about the human characters. Not even the father and son hunting team. I do think that killing pregnant women is sick and uncalled for. Use some better imagination, but I guess the writer and the SFX wizards don't have a slight idea on what that is, so they have to resort to garbage shock value. And no I didn't like the first one either. They are both film negatives which were wiped by execs, directors, and writers asses before they began filming. Please save your money and time, and demand that Colin and Greg Strause never be put behind a camera again. Shane Salerno should never use Final Draft or any other screenplay program again.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Having said that, AVP1 is a super cheese fest that is almost unwatchable. AVP-R pays much more homage to the original series. The creature sounds, score, themes etc. It's very violent, which is good given the subject matter. Cookie cutter characters for the humans, but they're just fodder anyway. My only problem still, is this need to have the AVP setting be modern day earth. WHY? At least make up some planet and have a colony setting. Overall, I was satisfied with it. Good creature FX, minimal CG, rated R, good sets and a better story than AVP1. Is it Aliens? No. If you're a fan of the creatures, you will enjoy it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1116,agent_of_death,so...,9,28 December 2007,"As most of the people who have commented already have said, I am shocked, but not for the same reasons. The film was predictable (but what movie isn't these days?). The plot line wasn't as well put together as I hoped, but it didn't rely on a plot twist every twenty minutes to keep the audience awake. And the fact that there was only one predator killing over 50 aliens seemed doubtful. However I knew that this is what the movie was going to be like, in fact I was doubtful if it even was half as good as the flop that was the original. I was shocked that I liked it much more than the first one. Many scenes in the film do seem to take off of some of the alien movies. But so far I've been saying only negative things about it, so here are the positives. If your looking for a movie that you can actually watch the whole way through, this would be it. It is non-stop action, and the plot line doesn't go so far off that you sit there wondering what is going on. The movie moves at a nice pace, not slow (like the bore that was No country for old men) and not to fast (like the mind numbing oceans 13). The aliens look way more menacing than the ones from the first one (they looked funny in the first), and the predator was much more of a hunter than any of the other films made the species look like. There are also many scenes which use the full capability of both the species, using many of the what ifs. And the thing that I liked most about this movie is that it was more real than any of the first avp movie, which went to far out on a tangent. So I have a theory about this movie, if you enter the theater expecting another Citizen Kane or Godfather, I can safely say YES you will be disappointed. But if your there to watch an exciting film that will leave you at the edge of your seat such as Resident Evil 3 or Hit-man, then NO you won't be disappointed. So in the end, It wasn't as good as Alien 1 or 2, it was WAY better than Alien 3&4, it had a more interesting plot than either predator movie, and it wasn't a disgrace like AVP1.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

1119,darthcypher,Impressive..... Most impressive,10,26 December 2007,"I was well pleased with this movie. I can't understand why anyone is ripping on it, unless your 14 years old and haven't seen any of the original movies. Or are just so blinded by CGI effects nowadays that if a movie isn't dripping out the sides with them you won't be impressed. Thats where I think the original was well and truly hopeless. This time around however, it was done very, very well, because there weren't all that many CGI effects at all. What CGI there was, was done well. Costumed guys for creatures really are the way to go with a movie like this. I remember seeing Alien and freaking out at that guy in the rubber suit with the drooling jaws.I was hugely disappointed in the original AVP. Being old enough to have seen the original Alien and Predator movies while I was still too young to completely understand them until later on in life, but still being hella scared ( it wasn't until I was about 18 that I actually sat and watched Aliens because the original scared the bejesus out of me when I was 12,) I felt really ripped off by what Paul Anderson did with his ""effort."" It just wasn't at all interesting to someone that grew up on the horror of the Alien bursting out of Kane, the Predator ripping Billy's spine out in the treetops etc etc. Anderson did what he wanted without any thoughts to those of us that knew what the first square off on film of these two iconic monsters should have been like. And he paid for it in the long run I think. The originals scared the crap out of me, even at about age 13 when I first saw both Predator and Alien followed by Aliens without a parental unit watching over my shoulder. Scared hell out of me, which is what I expect from movies like that. So I went into the cinema on Christmas Day without any expectations of this being any good at all.I was most pleasantly surprised. Quite a few times. While I am no longer young enough to be scared into crapping myself, if a movie like this can still make me jump, count me in. And I jumped a couple of times. My girlfriend had her head buried in my shoulder for half of it too, and she adores creepy movies.At first I thought it would be another movie with no character development, and when you think about it the only real characters that do get any are Dallas, his brother, Dalla's best friend the Sheriff( I thought it was a very smart idea that the directors used characters names from all the previous movies. It made me remember the original movies and compare them, and it does not lack at all) and Kelly and her daughter. I think her name was Ellen, right? :-) There were scenes in the movie that were almost remakes of parts of both franchises. Like when the Predator hunter comes to Earth, with his landing pod thing being released from the main ship. The bit directly after that with the water screwing with his invisibility. In the sewers, with the Predalien having started up a nest down there, very similar to a part near the end of the original Alien with Captain Dallas and Brett cocooned in the bowels of the Nostromo(although that was not seen until the release of Alien on DVD I thought it was a nice touch. Shows that the brothers did their research.) I really didn't give a rats which of the characters died in the original. I kept hoping that Sebastian guy would go first. Didn't care about them at all. This time around though, it was about the point where they are breaking into the camping store I thought to myself ""I actually want some of these guys to survive...."" I also thought the story was well put together too. You have to remember that Anderson left it open for the Predalien at the end of the first. The Brothers worked with what they had and end up wiping out AN ENTIRE TOWN. When I watched the original, it felt like it was over almost as soon as I sat down. This time around I felt a sense of having actually been to the movies and got what I paid for. And the bit I'll remember the most, Dallas telling Ricky......""GET TO THE CHOPPER!"" Had to have a chuckle at that, especially with the pause after he says that.I really was thoroughly impressed with this movie and am now looking forward to a third AVP, hopefully with the Brothers Strauss back at the helm.Keep Paul Anderson the hell away from movie studios whatsoever. He also ruined Resident Evil for me. Anyone lets him near Castlevania need to have their heads checked.........

Basics concepts like tempo or coherent story are completely ignored. There is absolutely no feeling to this movie. Aside from several well done shots, 99% of this is just annoying to watch. The first 30 minutes..... Well you will be sitting there looking at each other going ""Ok, anytime we wanna get on with the story/fighting/anything real happening"". Yes it's that bad. If you absolutely must watch this movie, just go rent it when its at your local video store.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1124,martynguk,"Lights, camera, action ... Well one out of three anyway",1,11 September 2017,"A truly awful movie that commences the first part of the story line in a sewer in near pitch darkness and remains there, possibly for atmosphere but more likely to mask the deficiencies of the special effects meaning you will be squinting long before the end credits roll proudly and tell you all about the makers.There is nothing wrong with B Movies and working with new talent or on a limited budget but there is a lot wrong with being pretentious along with it. Skip this and watch the first movies, they are less obnoxious and far less tedious.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1125,alex_dbs,What a disappointment!!! (speaking as a fanatic who's hard to disappoint),1,18 January 2008,"After waiting so long for this to come out and after all the hype and excitement, I'm am extremely disappointed! So disappointed in fact that i am writing this after seeing the film 2 hours ago.Now I'm a great fan of movies, I am also an easy person to please. I love loads of films, own far too many and am afraid to say i like bad films too. I cannot see what's wrong with AVP, I hear so many people complaints about it being terrible. When i think its one of the best, it delivers everything (except on the gore side of things). It didn't package itself as a serious film, so stop complaining that ""its not as good as alien"". I don't want a carbon copy of alien. While waiting for this to come out - expecting it to be excellent because people kept commenting on the Strause brothers being ""serious about aliens""... well, they can die. I was amazingly unimpressed... and that rarely ever happens! My problem with it, was that i didn't feel like i came away with anything. What was the point? I didn't like any of the characters! They really didn't bother trying to make you like them either. The soldier/mother and daughter characters didn't go anywhere, the bad boy who comes back to town doesn't do anything ""bad"". The only character I vaguely liked was Jesse and she dies. The editing was a bit to quick, there weren't any moments to breathe and take in what had happen. It happened all at once. I also felt a bit confused during fight scenes and had to look away for a moment.The Predalien was very cool, but void of much point, It would have been nice if it had spread embryos and then triggered the next stage of it life cycle (which was to be a queen according to the Strause brothers). Or maybe just include an ordinary queen? I would love to see the life cycle of a queen in a movie, growing in size each time you see her. that would be cool!!!! The effects in this are brilliant, no doubts there. The one thing you can say about previous alien and predator films is that they have always been character driven, thats where the Strause brothers tripped up. Next time lucky I hope!!!! Or just get someone else!!!! I hope you like it and to the Strause brothers.... what the f**k? I could do better!!! xxx",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1126,gpweclean,the Real Alien vs Predator,9,4 January 2008,"I've been a fan of these two creatures since i was 3, watching both predator and aliens more times than I can remember. when 2004's ""AvP"" was released i was incredibly disappointed as were so many other fans. Why? because the film really didn't have its fundamental idea. So when AvP-R was confirmed I didn't have a shred of hope that this film would be any good at all. But I was wrong, this film delivers what it promises....ALIENS VS PREDATOR! a lot of the complaints about this film are about human characters...really? it's a Vs. movie...do you expect great human drama?the film draws it strength from this, its trying to be the ultimate battle between the two creatures. not humans fighting the creatures. otherwise we'd have AvPvH-Rthe fights are great, excelling where ""AvP"" failed and really if you want to see this film is that not what you want? I recommend this to those that want to see Aliens fighting Predators or who were let down by ""AvP"", for those who expect human drama from a Vs. Movie I suggest you go see ""Kramer vs. Predator""",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1127,charlie_kilo,Not even remotely good.,1,1 June 2008,"This is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. Making a mockery of the previous alien, predator and alien vs predator films with it's cheesy lines and bad acting.Cheesy lines as ""mommy, are the monsters gone?"". Are they really necessary? Do not watch this movie, considering it's one of the worst movies i've ever seen, and i've seen a lot. Even if you're a big alien, predator or alien vs predator fan, you won't like this, because it's just THAT bad.

1128,L-fred,You Can't See Me,3,1 May 2008,"**** The above is not a star rating, it is an expletive.I could go into detail about the script, but I think the medium of film needs to be addressed first. This movie could have been a radio story from the 40's, because you can barely see a thing for the duration.With the exception of a couple of scene's at the beginning of the film which take place in daylight, and the last 15 minutes of the film, most of the action takes place in the dark. To make matters worse, the ever popular 'shakey camera' and rapid editing during action scene's also makes it very difficult to make anything out. You see something black and slimy, it could be an Alien, it could be the Predator, it could be a sweating cast member- you will never know, the scene is over.Tempted to crank my TV's brightness up to new level's not before achieved, I decided not to, I wasn't sure I wanted to see through the dark anyway. A lot of cliché and fan service, delivered too bluntly to be really appreciated.It's a shame, the costume's and CG seemed to have been done well, when you got a brief glimpse.I thought the Predator was supposed to use a cloaking device, not the whole film.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

The only thing I suspect is the special effects were so cheap, they thought they could get away with it as long as you cant see the film! Stay far from this film and anything else the director takes credit for. If I were him I would suggest making this an Alan Smithee Film. The acting was out of a high school production (Freshman Year) I don't even want to speak about the cinematographer. Can anyone say a substandard you-tube upload! John Ortiz played the same character as he did in Carlitos Way (minus the police uniform), which wasn't that great to start with. This was very disappointing on so many levels. But don't take my word for it.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1130,ThomasRobertson,Time for an AVP TV series ...,10,29 December 2007,"I'm giving this movie a ten out of ten simply to outweigh all the fools who are giving it bad reviews. I seriously feel it deserves about an 8. I am a HUGE Aliens and Predator fan (both separate and together) and found this movie to be putting both series back on the right track again. It was just all out fun and is certainly headed in the right direction. My ultimate dream is that FOX or the Sci-Fi Channel eventually takes a lead from Star Wars or its own Terminator series and turns the enterprise into a weekly television show (with the writers, special-fx creators, etc. from Battlestar Galactica). It is time. Keep releasing movies, but build the series with a TV show instead of relying on comics and books. I can't wait and I look forward to the next chapter in the series.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1131,worldeaters8899,Sorriest Piece of Filth,10,25 December 2007,"It'd bad enough that the franchise has diminished in quality since Riddley Scott's Alien, but this movie doesn't even make for a solid action/horror flick. If you're just looking for some action scenes strung together by a plot that 'almost' makes sense, this might be worth ten dollars. Aliens, Predator, and scifi fans in general however should stay far away.The acting was horrible. The characters were decent enough to make it to a large screen and that's it - none of them were even on par with a solid action film, and that is god awful.The writing was a compilation of preteen interpretations of cinema, if that paints a bad enough picture for you. Here are some quotes, ""We both know you aren't looking at the clock, you're looking at me."" *in reference to a high school student checking out this girl8* And later (while standing in her panties by the pool, ""So, are you looking at the clock, or are you looking at me?"" I'm sorry did the writers of Dawsons Creek covertly write this script? Then there was, ""I hope we're both wrong"" Gee I can understand not wanting the town to be bombed but you don't want people to escape either? The cinematic quality was just bad. Then only highlights came from the scenes with Aliens or the Predator, but even then it felt like a total rip off off the original Alien and Predator footage. I'm not against solid cinematic quality, but I am against it when the rest of the movie is so bad that you have to use someone else's skill to pass the movie off as decent.It's one thing to make a bad action movie, but it's another to make a horrible action/horror flick that rides off the success of other, better artists. There was no unifying factor to this movie, stale cheesy and completely unoriginal are understatements for the quality of the script, and this movie had more 2 dimensional characters than the SNES.Maybe the Strause Brothers are decent at special effects, but directing is clearly not their cup of tea and it is a crying shame that they were given the AvP IP to work on. The writer, I don't even know how or why they picked him, but again, the fans shouldn't be punished so an untried and unproven hack can singlehandedly vaporize any quality an AvP movie, or any movie at all, can have.I was sorely, sorely disappointed. I would have been less so if the movie would have kept the god awful quality of the first AvP, but these people have brought a fan-favorite down into the abysmal depths of crushing 'suck', and that's putting it lightly. If you can't even be on par with Paul Anderson, as bad as he is, you should not be making movies in the current fashion you are.Do not see this movie unless you are willing to pay ten bucks to see the Aleins and Predator in live action again, and are willing to sit in a chair for an hour and half to do it. Otherwise, it would be wiser to go pick up one of the originals on DVD.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1132,brendancole77,"Slightly better than the first one, but thats not saying much",2,30 January 2008,Aliens v Predator 2 was about as interesting as peeling paint of a wall. The action scene's were the usual close up camera angles. So you cant make out what is actually going on. And yet again the absence of a strong lead character was the major weakness as in the first movie. The makers seemed to feel that the higher the body count the better the movie. So the kills piled up and my interest wained. I cant remember the last time I looked at my watch so often during a movie. Both franchises seem to be doomed after this latest offering. Though the closing scene seems suggest that another Aliens v Predator could be in the offing. Though at least one of the humans didn't befriend the Predator.,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

We finally get to see these two nasties duke it out in full R rated glory as it should be. Of course the humans were boring and seemed to be extras from other teeny-bopper flicks, but they are just meant to be hosts and target practice for the true stars of the film. I will admit that some scenes were a little tasteless, especially the 8 year old boy and the maternity ward scenes, but the tie-in to the other Alien films at the end made it worthwhile. Plus, it is the first time since Aliens that I actually felt tension in the rest of the audience, and my brother-in-law told me that in several scenes he thought he was going to rip the armrest off of the chair because he was gripping it so tight. Cannot wait for the third!!!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem
1134,lgretton,Execrable,1,5 February 2008,"Really, only the review for Spinal Tap's Shark Sandwich album will do this terrible, terrible film justice, but IMDb's censors won't let me be that succinct.This is the sort of movie one gets when two teenage boys are let loose with tens of millions of dollars of studio money and no parental control. There's no doubt that the Strauss brothers are big fans of the Alien franchise, it's stamped on every frame of this shockingly bad movie. Even a short exchange between Ripley and Newt only available on the extended edition of Aliens is milked for a sick joke in a particularly unpleasant scene in a maternity ward.All this could be forgiven if it was at least entertaining in a brain dead kind of way, but the titular beasts aren't given enough screen time, and much of the action consists of people shooting in the dark at shadows off-camera. I can at least give a desultory hand-clap to the amount of gore, something the previous AvP lacked in an ill-advised attempt to make it child-friendly, but in this film it's all wrong, characters we've just got to know have their heads ripped apart or melted without any concern for the viewer's relationship with them. The film-makers probably think they're cleverly wrong-footing us, the way that Ridley Scott did by killing off Tom Skerritt's character in Alien, but they'd be wrong, they're just rubbish.I haven't even started on the script and cast of characters, they're both laughable.Anybody with any influence in Hollywood, I implore you: never let Beavis and Butthead behind the camera again.I can only hope that many people lost their jobs after this debacle and returned to lives of crushing drudgery. Never mind the writers going on strike, I'm surprised that audiences haven't started angrily picketing cinemas with shocking dross like this coming out of Hollywood.",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

I thought it was made in awful taste to have aliens jumping out of children, newborn babies, and ""in labor"" pregnant women! This movie was sick and just a bunch of blood and gore with no good storyline at all and the predator was out of character. Everyone knows the predator doesn't kill the sick, the young, or the unarmed?? Not to mention the aliens and the predator shots were dark and hard to see. There was this new looking alien with predator characteristics (which seemed odd) and you kept trying to get a good look and never got one. Then to have everyone die and the aliens and the predator just get blown up by the military what a crappy ending wheres the great fight scenes and the human interaction??!!! Then the very ending there is the woman and weird conversation like a weird x-files ending instead of an AVP ending. I do not recommend this movie ever!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

It is in no doubt the murder of a quality franchise and you get to figure it in the first few minutes of the movie. Bad rushy acting, a pathetic pseudo-teen-drama with no sense make this movie one of the worse titles I've ever seen. If you figure the cool style of the Predators or the scary Alien beasts will somehow make it worth watching this one, it won't. I honestly couldn't sit through the whole movie and, being a movie lover as I am, that's a very strong sign on how weak a production is. I figure the people behind this movie should be banned from ever working in the movie industry ever again, as well as the people who ""wrote"" this ""script"".

So, in summary: If you love watching the coolest fictional monsters in movie history kick each others asses, and kill everybody who gets in between, you SHOULD love this movie.

However Steve Pasquale and Reiko Aylesworth where solid enough. The rest of the cast appeared to be reading off cue cards.The action was terrible. It was edited horribly, it was too dark and the close ups where way too close. The action scenes where filmed the same way Paul Anderson filmed them in the first AvP.Lastly the movie was really poorly paced, it seems like Ricky the Pizza Boy got more screen time than any other human character and the opening portion of the film was slow and without purpose.Save your money and watch I Am Legend or Sweeny Todd instead.2/10",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

I went to see it on the 25th December with the full knowledge that I was going to get some good action, cool weapons design, a cool alien kicking another alien's backside, and probably not much plot. That's why I went to see the movie - for the weapons and the action - and that's what I got. And I loved it. Mainly the predator though (he kicked a**), and his weapons. Now I really want to see the first AVP and Predator 2.Bottom line is: if you're the type that liked Resident Evil 1 & 2, Doom, etc - then go see this movie. It's good.If you're looking for something more meaningful, well, I can recommend ""The Rock"" - that has both action and human morality etc etc in it. But don't go to AVPR and then complain about it.

OF COURSE NOT.. it was meant to be entertaining.. if you hated it, so what? it will not change my life at all..the creatures: i really believe the creatures in AvP:R were much better than the ones shown in the first AvP movie.. the predator is thinner and MUCH BETTER!! the aliens looks like the ones from the second movie.. the Predalien is my all time favorite.. even more than the alien queen..Special effects: i am so happy with the result.. it look's real, and believable, very little CGI, the blood looks real too, eye candy visual effects.cast: OK maybe it was not the best cast ever, but did any of you actually came to see the actors? haha, i didn't.. i came to see the aliens and (the)predator, i got what i wanted, humans getting killed here and there.. for the people who complain about the pregnant woman and the young kid.. oh my god.. give us a break.. i mean OK i never excepted the pregnant woman to get killed this way, i got to admit i was kind of surprised.. but this is AvP.. not a damn fairytale, you all expect to see people being happy? there is a reason why it's Rated R.. and Jesse is Hot BTW! too bad she got killed..violence: top-notch, i got to admit there is probably a little too much at some point, but i can take a lot of gore.. exactly what i expected/wanted from this movie Plot: the plot.. the so called ""reason"" why 90% of the people hated/disliked/were disappointed.. who cares about the damn plot, i surely don't.. if i want to see an action/horror movie, i just want to see the kills/blood, if i want to see a movie with a good story then i will watch one.. that's it..i could go on and on.. but i don't feel like typing a whole essay.. this movie is maybe not the best in all the aliens/predator franchise.. but it's very enjoyable and worth it.. if you are a fan like i am, i don't regret that i went on Christmas day to see it..i am rating AvPR a 9 out of 10, it has it's good/bad, no movies are perfect.. i removed one point for 2 reasons, it's kinda true it was too dark at one point.. and also it was too short, other than that, AWESOME!",Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem

Most of the fight scenes are shot in the darkness and in short range which makes it difficult to understand what's happening, and it is quite tiring for the eyes. A lot of pointless butchering of many of the characters makes you care even less when someone else gets killed. After watching it, I was left with an overall unsatisfying feeling. The ending of the movie leaves you the same unsatisfied as the rest of the movie. All together, the plot, the scenes, the acting e.t.c. is a bit below average.
