0,TheLittleSongbird,"Messy and a missed opportunity, with a few good points",4,4 July 2015,"Return to Sender did have some potential, a subject that is hard-hitting and easy to relate to and Rosamund Pike and Nick Nolte are watchable in a lot of their work. Return to Sender has some decent assets, but overall is pretty messy and like a missed opportunity.Pike is nowhere near as good as her deservedly Oscar-nominated performance in Gone Girl (a far superior film, no matter how polarising it is, and Amy is much more interestingly written than Miranda), but she still plays the role with charisma and an appropriate iciness. Shiloh Fernandez has his unsure moments but mostly suitably sleazy, but the film's best performance comes from Nick Nolte, whose sympathetic performance gives a glimmer of emotional backbone and his character is the one character and asset that is halfway credible. Return to Sender is reasonably well-filmed too and fits the atmosphere well with some nice shots.The rest of the cast reads of acting like wooden marionettes, and none of the characters are fleshed out are often underwritten. Apart from some of the camera work, the production values are generally too TV-film quality and the direction is lazy and confused, showing a lot of inexperience in the genre, a lack of suspense and a lack of ability to make the narrative cohesive. The script is illogical, predictable and completely lacking in realism, the way it flows and is delivered also never feels natural. The story is all over the place and doesn't know what it wants to be, it does agreed feel like three different films and it does little with the second and third acts, the first act actually does have a little tension and some genuine sympathy for Miranda.However, the character study second act has some far too pedestrian and lazy pacing, far too wooden and underdeveloped characterisation (with the exception of Nolte) and emotional impact is minimal (only provided by Nolte). And the third revenge act is sorely devoid of tension or suspense, increasing predictability to the extent that you're exclaiming 'we knew it!' and suffers from Miranda's actions not being believable for a second. The ending is very rushed and even the open feel felt abrupt and under-explained, it is also rather brutal and any sympathy felt for Miranda in the first act is completely diminished here.Overall, messy (with the biggest offender being the story) and a missed opportunity, with its moments (the performances of Pike, Nolte and Fernandez, some nice shots and a decent first act). 4/10 Bethany Cox",Return to Sender
1,SnoopyStyle,flat TV movie level,4,23 September 2017,"Miranda Wells (Rosamund Pike) is a hospital nurse. Her friends set her up on a blind date. She finds William Finn (Shiloh Fernandez) on her door step and assumes him to be her date. She lets him in and he rapes her. The police later catches him. She is told that her rape has made it hard to sell her house. Her hands start shaking and she can't advance to be a surgical nurse. Her nice persona changes and she writes a letter to William in prison. It is sent back with Return to Sender. Mitchell Wells (Nick Nolte) is her father and Nancy (Camryn Manheim) is her best friend co-worker.Fouad Mikati's directions are only TV movie level. It's a waste of cinematic level talents of the cast. I have no complaint about the cast but it doesn't rise up to their level. It's also not comparable to Lifetime movies or anything of that sort. It is really disconcerting to see talents wasted this way. One of my pet peeves is the metallic echo when they speak to each other over the prison phones. It's one of the wrong choices that keep this movie down. It's too static with much of the time spent in that prison visiting booth. Any shocking descent is flattened by that stationary camera work. By the time he gets out, the movie is two thirds over and I stop caring about the rest. There is an obvious twist that is done much better in Hard Candy. This would be a good Twilight Zone or a horror TV episode. It's not cinematic enough to be theatrical.",Return to Sender
2,claudio_carvalho,Flawed Thriller,4,25 January 2016,"The single nurse Miranda Wells (Rosamund Pike) is preparing to become surgical nurse and is buying the house of her dreams. Miranda is very close to her father Mitchell Wells (Nick Nolte) that is helping her to fix her house to sell it to raise the necessary money to buy the other house. One day, a colleague schedules a blind date with a sweet man called Kelvin. Miranda is still getting dressed when she sees a man on the porch. She assumes that the man is Kevin and invites him in, but he is actually a rapist that rapes her. When the real Kevin arrives, he finds Miranda in the kitchen and calls the police. Miranda identifies the rapist William Finn (Shiloh Fernandez) that is immediately arrested. When she recovers, her life turns upside down since nobody wants to buy her house and she can not be a surgical nurse since her right hand has tremors after the rape. Out of the blue, she writes a letter to William but the letter returns to her. She insists on sending it and when she receives a reply, she goes to the prison to visit William. When Williams is released, he is welcomed by Miranda in her house. What is happening to Miranda? ""Return to Sender"" is a flawed thriller about a woman that sees her life partially destroyed after a rape. The Brazilian title is a spoiler since discloses that it is a story of revenge. However the plot is flawed since there are many evidences that Miranda had visited William in the prison and might have witnesses seeing the man working at her house. Therefore, in case of any investigation of his disappearance, Miranda could be a suspect since she has the motive. There are more smart means of revenging. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Sede de Vingança"" (""Thirsty of Revenge"")",Return to Sender

4,Sleepin_Dragon,A slow burner that never ignites.,5,14 October 2015,"Miranda Wells, a beautiful young Nurse from a small town is invited on a blind date with a tall, dark and handsome chap 'Kevin.' Miranda has definite issues with pens and a few other quirks. When a guy turns up to meet her, she assumes he's Kevin, but events go tragically wrong, later the real Kevin turns up.There are some definite pacing issues, it is so slow in parts, dare I say it becomes a little boring. Some scenes are so slow and overdone this movie could be edited and shown in less then an hour. The movie itself is quite hard to follow, there are times when I didn't know what was going on. It's a little telegraphed at times, you kinda know what she's all about.Definitely issues with her dad's dog, but why did she do what she did, I appreciate it was a pretty dress, she never forgave it for that. I think that showed us her capacity for slow and definite revenge.I love Rosamund Pike, she showed in Gone Girl just how good she is, but here she's just a bit flat and makes Miranda uninteresting, thank goodness for Nick Nolte, he added a bit of spirit and warmth to the film that was otherwise lacking.When she performs a tracheotomy in the restaurant she got a round of applause? Would that truly happen?I can't make out if I thought the ending was good or terrible, it was certainly a switch in tempo.How many hairstyles did she have in this film? Every scene she looked like she'd been re-styled.Considering the matter this film deals with I would have thought it would have left me sad or angry, but it left me a bit cold.Some good elements, just a bit of a let down. 5/10",Return to Sender
5,hitchcockthelegend,Address Known - Motives Sketchy.,5,23 May 2016,"Fouad Mikati directs and Patricia Beauchamp and Joe Gossett write this slow burn drama that sadly never resorts to anything of note. It stars Rosamund Pike, Shiloh Fernandez and Nick Nolte. Music is by Daniel Hart and cinematography by Russell Carpenter.A small town nurse is raped and takes the decision to befriend the rapist while he's in prison. Is it a way of exorcising her demons? Or something sinister?You can see and feel that there's a real good film here trying to get out, a meditation on a number of things that only victims of heinous crimes can truly understand. There's interesting observations on sociopathy, fractured family values and loneliness, but in spite of the sterling efforts of Pike to make it work, it's constructed so poorly, too often wearisome, and it cheats by not paying off on the slow- burn approach. The final revelation only makes you realise that it has taken an hour and half of film to achieve what American Mary did in 20 minutes! Add in that Nolte is utterly wasted and that Fernandez simply isn't strong enough for the role (he's the guy that isn't Joaquin Phoenix), and you got one messy movie that's best avoided. 5/10",Return to Sender
6,LeonLouisRicci,Mishandled Rape-Revenge Story...Disappointing Cop-Out Ending,1,18 December 2015,"Competent acting from the three leads can't even begin to save this total misconception. The Movie is mishandled on every level. But what it does that is totally unacceptable is cheat its target audience with an ending that cops-out and leaves the viewer flat and unfulfilled. One guesses, and only guesses, that the message here is that after being raped the victim will devolve into an Obsessive/Compulsive that has a fixation on pens for reasons the screenplay never sees fit to explain. The kicker is that Her act of revenge is left off screen and to everyone's imagination and wondering.Nothing much is explained about the victim's behavior other than She has been traumatized to the point of no return, and she has a twitch in Her hand. Overall, this is a depressing letdown and why after an Oscar nomination Rosamund Pike decided to do this bit of bad B-Movie making is, again, anyone's guess.",Return to Sender
7,deloudelouvain,Could have been much better but still it's not bad,7,16 October 2015,"I am just going to rate this movie with a seven because the actors were good. The story itself was not bad and even pleasant to follow. The only thing that I was sad about is that the things that happened in the end should have happened much earlier in the movie to make it more entertaining. You just got to wait too long for those things to happen and I could see it coming from miles away. Nevertheless Rosamund Pike and Shiloh Fernandez gave us good performances, and even the old Nick Nolte was believable in his role. But like I said, it's a pity that the story did not peak in the middle instead of the end. I am sure Return To Sender would have done better with the ratings then. But still it's an okay movie to watch once.",Return to Sender
8,cosmo_tiger,Nothing amazing and a little generic but it was very entertaining and I really had a good time watching this.,7,7 September 2015,"""I'm getting paroled soon, does that make you nervous?"" Miranda (Pike) is a nurse who is on her way toward a big promotion at her hospital. She is sitting at home getting ready for her blind date when he shows up early. The man is not who is claims to be and William (Fernandez) commits an unthinkable crime. Now with him behind bars but on his way out Miranda's feelings about him begin to change. I don't want to give anything away but I will say that I love these kind of movies. Even though this is a little generic and very predictable Pike really does all she can to try and save it. If you are looking for an edge of your seat thriller full of twists and turns this is not the movie you are looking for. If you just want something to be entertained by and a movie that will satisfy the dark part of you you could do worse than this one.

9,leonblackwood,Lacked substance! 3/10,3,1 August 2015,"Review: Rosamund Pike plays another psychopathic role, like her character in Gone Girl, which is based on revenge after she is raped in her own home. She decides to play the long game and she becomes friends with the rapist, while he's in jail. When he comes out on parole, the rapist tries to begin a relationship with her because he thinks that they have a special kind of chemistry, but the nurse has other plans in her mind. I did find the storyline predictable and I was surprised how gullible the rapist was. With that aside, Pike does play the psychological roles very well and the disturbing rape scene looked very realistic. Nolte only had a small role in the film but he did play his part quite well and it was good to see him back on the big screen. Personally, I think the movie lacked substance and there wasn't enough material to work with. You end up just waiting for the revenge plot to happen and the storyline in between was dry and pretty boring. At the end of the day, the guy got everything he deserved, even though she was a crazy lady! Watchable!Round-Up: At 36 years old, Rosamund Pike has starred in a wide range of movies, from the big budget movies like Jack Reacher, Gone Girl and Wrath of the Titans to low budget movies like Freefall, A Long Way Down and the Big Year. Since 2002, she has shot to fame after her role in Die Another Day and her brilliant performance in Gone Girl has made her a bankable star. I'm just afraid that she might get type casted in these type of roles. Anyway, this film was directed by Foaud Mikati who also made Operation Endgame with Zach Galifianakis. This is a completely different type of movie which needed more to the storyline but the anticipation of the revenge keeps you glued to your seat. Personally, I wasn't that impressed with the outcome which is why I'm not surprised that it went straight to DVD. I recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/thrillers about a nurse who gets brutally raped in her own home and seeks revenge. 3/10",Return to Sender
10,subxerogravity,"Interesting emotional trip, with a great performance, that turns into Hollywood fluff",6,18 August 2015,"I've seen movies in which women get raped, I'm a Special Victims Unit fan, but I can't recall seeing a movie in which a woman deals with rape, not like this at least.Rosamund Pike plays a woman who is about to transcend to a bigger and better level in her life, until an encounter with a stranger totally messes up her head. Pike's performance moved me, as I watched her subtle change after the fact, that was just a domino effect in everything that she was working for. I saw something I never really thought about with sexual assault, in a way that was more effective than hearing about it.The movie had a chance to be brilliant, then for whatever reason they decided to fall into Hollywood movie clichés most likely to get the theatrical release they got, but it does not fit into the movie and softens the effect it was having on me. But overall, I'm glad I went to see it, and got to experience of seeing Rosamund Pike do this. They tackled raped from an angle that I never seen, and it worked.",Return to Sender
11,jtindahouse,A strange experience,7,10 August 2016,"I'm sitting here having watched 'Return to Sender' and I genuinely don't know what to think. I'm not even sure whether I enjoyed it or not. I could justify giving it a '3' and I could equally justify giving it a '9'. It's my kind of movie first of all. I love the 'revenge' genre. This is an odd case of that genre though. In fact I wasn't even sure it was that type of movie until 4/5 of the way through, despite the movie poster heavily implying it. It's not a particularly well made movie, at least technically. The sound engineering is poorly done in certain scenes. Every scene involving the prison phones is incredibly hard to hear the dialogue in. It chops in and out and is often inaudible. The story is choppy and alienates the audience at times by leaving them clueless as to what the point of this all is. And yet through all this, I was having a pretty good time watching it (I think).Rosamund Pike is a very fine actress and has the chops to carry a movie (as she proved in 'Gone Girl'). She's again pretty good here, and with a stronger script could have accomplished a performance on par with her one in 'Gone Girl' (the two roles are actually strikingly similar). It's hard to explain exactly what an odd experience 'Return to Sender' is to someone who hasn't seen it. Would I recommend this film for someone to watch? I'm still not entirely sure. The only thing I can say is watch it to see what I mean.",Return to Sender
12,arthur_tafero,Return to Sender - An Appropriate Title,2,4 April 2019,"I like Rosamund Pike. She is intelligent, good-looking and sexy, and an excellent actress. The problem is, however, we are always aware that she is acting and she never gets into character. All her film personas have zero character development. Meryl Streep, on the other hand, submerges herself completely into the character she is playing, and you have no sense at all that she is acting; she IS the character. Rosamund cannot do that; for all her talent, she seems to refuse to surrender herself to any character of any film. She is always Rosamund Pike. She is a lot like John Wayne in that regard. It really didn't matter what role John Wayne was playing; he was always John Wayne. Rosamund Pike is the female version of John Wayne. This film was trite and a waste of time, but I really do hope to see her capture a character some day; like Charlize Theron in Monster or Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth.",Return to Sender
13,3xHCCH,"Puzzling ""Therapy"" for Rape Victims",4,19 June 2015,"Miranda (Rosamund Pike) is a nurse who's got it all it seems -- her own nice house, a loving supportive Dad (Nick Nolte), a stable career about to go the next level. One day, a lecherous stranger William (Shiloh Fernandez) gains access into her house and rapes her. As her neat little world comes crumbling down around her, Miranda embarks on a novel form of ""therapy"", in the hope of recovering from the brutal trauma she suffered.A rapist is not only a sexual assaulter, but also the ultimate bully and power-tripper. A rape victim is violated not only sexually and physically, but also psychologically, mentally and even spiritually. What may be a few minutes of torture will haunt a victim for a lifetime.Powerfully rich in dramatic pain and torment, rape and its aftermath had been the topic of thousands of films and TV shows. Akira Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" (1950) and Ingmar Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring"" (1960) are both Oscar-winning classics of World Cinema. ""Johnny Belinda"" (1948) and""The Accused"" (1988) have won Best Actress Oscars for Jane Wyman and Jodie Foster respectively. But no, before you expect too much, this film definitely does not have Oscars in its future.Lead star Rosamund Pike shot ""Return to Sender"" BEFORE her Oscar- nominated turn in ""Gone Girl"". There is a lot of her ""Gone Girl"" performance here as well -- the subtle mysterious boiling under her cool-as-ice exterior. The strange script makes her do a lot of illogically unexpected, supposedly therapeutic activities, and Pike does them with her game face straight on. Seeing her make these puzzling decisions, we are as frustrated as her father Mitchell was in the film. Shiloh Fernandez was clearly up to no good the moment we see him on screen. He has got a raw roguish look about him that makes him work as this vile character. Nick Nolte is now all grandfatherly and Santa Claus-like with his white beard and body heft, playing MIranda's father Mitchell. This is so unlike how I last remember him during his prime in the 1990s in film like ""Cape Fear"" or ""The Prince of Tides.""Watching ""Return to Sender"" felt like watching three different short films which were just tenuously connected to each other. The final act was so predictable yet still so maddening because it never really showed us clearly what happened. We will be expected to interpret the scene in our own way. I am sure those who have invested time to follow the movie to this point may not exactly relish this disappointing ending. 4/10.",Return to Sender
14,s3276169,Predictable.....,5,2 September 2015,"Return to Sender is a rather predictable crime drama. It took me less than half the film to figure out what was happening and what the outcome would be. Sadly the script is well worn revenge fare that falls short of the mark. For me, this film would have had far more impact had it walked a gentler path of reconciliation and redemption. Of course, this would have meant painting the villain of the piece in a more positive light but that was not to be. That's not to say this is a poor film. Rosamund Pike does a reasonable job in the lead role. I was surprised to see Nick Nolte. I thought he might have retired. I'm glad he's still acting and for me, his performance was the highlight of this film. All in all, Return to Sender is watchable but I really can not find any firm foundation on which to recommend it. Five out of ten from me.",Return to Sender
15,robertemerald,Quiet thriller in comparison to others of this genre,7,25 January 2020,"Rosamund Pike was brilliant in Return to Sender. That is what sustained me through watching this movie. She is a fascinating character. It got too late at night to watch anymore after about an hour in, but I really looked forward to returning to it throughout the next day. When I did I was a little disappointed, but overall I'm still really glad I watched it. 'Revenge' is the last word mentioned on the blurb on the back of the dvd. Yes, ultimately, it is a revenge movie, but it is an immeasurably quieter version than, say, I Spit On Your Grave (2010), a movie that rivalled Saw (2004) for intensity, cruelty and violence. I Spit On Your Grave was an almost unwatchable graphic representation of a rape and subsequent revenge. Return To Sender's aims are far more realistic and believable, not to mention way less graphic, a sort of tragic and odd confluence of factors that lead to an unusual woman taking an unusual revenge. You sympathise with her, and after the movie feel a delicious conflicting of emotions as to whether the path she took was one you would approve of. I guess that was the point of the movie, and, for me, it is a controversy that is worthy of praise. If you are after a rollicking 'revenge' movie however, well, there are many more out there way more graphic than this one. In this one you can see the revenge coming, but it doesn't arrive until perhaps an hour after the rape. Return To Sender is after an audience that appreciates the true consequences of a rape and how it can have devastate, and how it can have more consequences than you might expect. And in this regard, and as a low budget movie that is purely character driven, Return To Sender certainly succeeds.",Return to Sender

17,billygoat1071,Neglecting the Real Danger,4,18 June 2015,"Return to Sender is quite a weird concept. It's about a rape victim who seduces her rapist so she could conquer her trauma, and of course, lead to a revenge. It's queasy, but simple enough. And a recipe of this strange idea won't be effective if it wasn't for Rosamund Pike, who was fresh from an Oscar nomination, by doing what she exactly did from that movie. It's fine by that, but unfortunately, the movie struggles defining the danger of this rather daring act. We can't exactly see who is much crazier or who has more of the darker intention, who is more clever and who is naive. This clashing mystery is supposed to make it more exciting and tense, but the movie loses its way by hardly acknowledging the scarier possibilities because both characters push the limits of their humanity.The first act is honestly strong for a rather schlocky material. Sure, the direction still feels pretty B-rated, but the setup brings real potential for a compelling story arc. The rape doesn't only ruined the main character's sensibilities, it also kept her from leaving the house where the incident took place, being haunted by the trauma even more. The solution of her problem is just pretty weird. Sure, she is facing her own fears, trying to befriend with the worst person she knows, but it eventually neglects the augmented danger once she tries to make the rapist fall in love with her. This is the point where the characters shifts into being unbelievable.The real tension must rely on questioning how is this a good idea to overcome her fears or getting the revenge she wanted. The movie doesn't likely make the two look in danger because they already seem too crazy to worry about their fate, that it might lead themselves to a fight scene or something. At least in Gone Girl, there is a sense of being dubious on Amy's plan. Here, Miranda seems to be too smug on what she's doing, that her eventual insanity is just a downright contrivance. Another comparison to Pike's other movie, the ""big"" scenes there are built with surprise. Here, even at a twisted scene, it just feels unexciting and even worse, predictable. Only the performances can level it up, somewhat. Rosamund Pike's better moments happen in the first act. The rest is like turning her into a larger caricature than she should be. The only good actor in the supporting is obviously Nick Nolte who has great moments with Pike which turn almost everything into a totally different, but better movie.Return to Sender already feels uncomfortable in its concept; it turns a serious subject as a backdrop of a typical thriller. But even for its set pieces, the suspense almost felt nonexistent. The two conflicting characters may go nuts with nothing left to lose, but you just don't care about what point would it lead to their downfall. It's hard to get inserted into these characters. There is a sense of reality, at the same time, a forced insanity in the end. Gone Girl does have that intersection of realism and absurdity, but at least it was done with style, interesting commentary and genuine shock. Here, it's all standard campiness. It's not quite fun, not even to those who are seeking for more of Rosamund Pike being a sociopath and destroying some man's life.",Return to Sender
18,bob_meg,"Emotionally complex, uncompromising... not what you'd expect from this genre of picture",10,23 August 2015,"The press reviews for Return to Sender have really irritated me, writing the film off as a cheap, sensational exploitation picture simply because it happens to fall into the Rape Revenge genre.Granted, this is a very difficult realm to create a unique and compelling story in --- the lines are razor thin. Go too brutal on either the crime or the punishment and you're into torture exploitation I-Spit-On-Your-Grave territory very quickly, which is NOT what this film is trying to be on any level.First and foremost, Patricia Beauchamp and Joe Gossett's script goes to great lengths to make both the victim, Miranda (a superlative Rosamund Pike) and her rapist (Shiloh Fernandez) human and flaw-ridden. Shockingly, Pike's character isn't incredibly likable. She's a control-freak, a hygiene-freak, and she commits more than a few vile acts on her path to vengeance and regaining her grip on life. But Pike plays her with such humanity and vulnerability that you can't help but be on her side.Fernandez does a similar sleight-of-hand with the rapist role --- a part damned to caricature in virtually every film I've seen. I'm not saying you feel empathy for the guy (he really IS a creep) but the script allows him to be human and express a range of emotions (guilt, remorse, desperation, loneliness, rage, sadism) --- he comes across as a living breathing damaged man, which only jacks up the tension because you know Pike's character has something incredibly nasty up her sleeve for him (and rightly so) for the whole film, yet she never really tips her hand either.It takes courage to write characters with this deep a shading of gray, because 70% of the audience will hate you for it. Most casual viewers despise being made to make up their own minds about a character. It's much less taxing to have the writer label them.The rape scene was pitch perfect in its level of violence without going down such a graphic road that we feel complicit for watching (""Lipstick"" or ""I Spit on Your Grave"") and neither is the climax. Watching both Pike and Fernandez in this film is pretty damn amazing at times. They communicate tomes with just their facial expressions and body language.Add to this a stellar turn by journeyman Nick Nolte (watching him brandish a two-by-four in outrage is awesome) and drop-ins by Camryn Manheim and Illeana Douglas and you've got an A-class production.My only complaint is that the ending seemed anti-climactic, and was telegraphed far too long in advance. But Return to Sender really isn't about something so shallowly commercial as ""the payoff"" --- it's far too emotionally rich for that. Instead, it paints a compelling portrait of two very flawed people caught in a toxic snake-eating-it's-own-tail circle of hate and violence, which neither really escape.",Return to Sender
19,in1984,"Rapist, Victim, or Dog-hater Fantasy?",6,27 May 2015,"6.25 of 10. Is it the fantasy of a rapist or a victim? That's part of the mystery of this film that initially seems like Rosamund Pike taking a step back into a TV-like nurse/hospital surgery story drama-lite hiding another tale of a sweet woman finding true love or an emergency room fest. Fortunately, it's a decoy and slowly starts to expand into something else.Instead, we get a quirky germ-a-phobic involved in a strange case of post-traumatic-stress, forgiveness of a violent crime, and a psychopath.The ending doesn't explicitly setup a sequel, but the nature of the climax and ending set one up very well.The weak spots involve some sharp shifts in what's happening, very little plot development, and why certain people are looked to or how something is known.

""Return to Sender"" however suffers under bad writing and an unsatisfactory plot-twist seen from miles away. However, that doesn't detract from Pike's performance. In fact, with the lack of suspense, the ball is entirely in her court. She plays it beautifully and is bizarrely compelling despite how under-written her character is.

Of course it's slightly different, for example, Gone Girl is written better. But it has similarities, like Rosamund Pike. Her character seems to be Amy from Gone Girl - again! I've read it a million times online and I can now say it myself, the plot of Return to Sender is pretty standard. I don't even usually watch movies where the two main themes are rape and revenge, because they tend to go the same way over and over again. Return to Sender has it's differences, mostly the character of Miranda, who I'm going to talk about later. But the thing is those little details don't matter that much when the plot has been repeated million times. The character, Miranda is interesting in a lot of ways. She seems likable, but it's hard to say why. She has friends and she's a nurse, so clearly there's something nice about her. There also seems to be something off about her. She seems to be very careful about few things. She seems very distant to the viewer. When she starts visiting the rapist, she seems even more distant. We see what makes her go to him, but we still don't know the exact reason. Of course we can guess it, because it's easy to expect that, but still it's very confusing for a moment. The thing about Miranda is that she seems to be this nice nurse but you can't help but feel there's something weird about her. Trust that instinct. But that's what makes her character more interesting - except that she's now too close to Amy. If Miranda had been played by any other actress, maybe that connection wouldn't be so easy to make. Of course she is good at playing this kind of characters. Rosamund Pike is good at being weirdly and calmly scary. And the movie is timed very well. It's not exactly a long film, but the weird relationship between Miranda and William kept going for a while, so I almost thought I had figured the movie out all wrong. Well, I wasn't wrong, but making that even that one small moment longer made it feel like wait a minute, what is going on? That's one important thing about structure - you change something in the usual timed structure of the film and it feels weird, because we are so used to that typical tempo.What's mostly wrong about it is the timing. People weren't over Gone Girl when this one came out, so obviously everyone is starting to compare it to Gone Girl in their heads. And comparing to Gone Girl, Return to Sender doesn't stand a chance.Return to Sender is worth a watch, if you haven't seen too many ""rape & revenge"" type of movies, or if you really like them. If you're bored with them, then it's not for you.",Return to Sender
26,ivko,bring a bucket of brain bleach,2,26 September 2020,"This isn't a good movie. It's about a woman who experiences a horrifying trauma and loses her effing mind. The first 30 minutes or so establish her as someone who has a touch of OCD or is maybe a bit on the spectrum before the inciting event occurs and changes her life. Unfortunately, the event is shown in graphic detail, which I frankly wish had not been the case because I felt nauseous afterwards for several hours. I cannot overstate how graphic and ugly the scene is.Anyway, after what happens happens, she begins acting in an extremely unusual way, which worries her friends and family. I'm not entirely sure what the movie was aiming for, exactly, as there is not really any big reveal or surprise that wasn't shown in detail on the movie box, so there really isn't any tension. Even if they didn't give away the store on the movie cover, it should be extremely obvious to any viewer exactly what she's doing. The only people who don't know what's going on are the other characters in the movie, because otherwise everything would fall apart.Even after the climactic moments of the film are over, the movie ends feeling a little like they just ran out of funds and had to stop filming. There isn't really an end so much as just a fade to black with a bunch of loose threads left unresolved. I got this movie by accident; Amazon sent me this movie instead of the movie I actually ordered, and didn't bother to even ask for it back because shipping was more than the film was worth, but even free I regret losing the time I spent watching it.

27,tr91,It's an OK film as long as you have low expectations,6,27 May 2015,"*****This review contains spoilers***** If you don't expect Gone Girl then the film is quite good. Nothing special but definitely watchable.The film follows Miranda (Rosamund Pike, pretty much the reason I wanted to watch this film) who lives in a small town. We only see her with her work colleagues and also her father (Nick Nolte). We see her having troubles around town and she is also dating. One day one of her dates, William (Shiloh Fernandez), arrives early and causes her a lot of harm, going to prison in this process.I'm sure if you have read anything about this film you will know the subject matter. This particular scene is very brutal and quite a lengthy scene. It made me feel sick.The film from this point goes a few different directions and had me questioning some of the actions of the characters. We see Pike and Fernandez's characters agreeing to meet in the prison. They believe that they can erase the horrible memory by getting to know each other and putting things right. Some of these scenes are hard to watch and at times a little cringe worthy.When William is released from prison, the film becomes even more strange as we see him go to Miranda's house (something which she agrees to) to help fix the house up. She is trying to sell the house but nobody will buy. William goes to the house for a few days helping her out and it is just strange, it is one of the weirdest on screen relationships I have ever seen. I didn't know if this was it or whether there would be one last twist.It was very much a slow burning process appearing to go nowhere until that classic scene happens, yes you guessed it, William's drink is spiked by Miranda...how predictable. She then takes him hostage in her basement and becomes to torture him in a style similar to Ellen Page in Hard Candy (2005).After finally getting to this stage of the film I felt the ending was rushed. Everything is left open to the imagination of the viewer as nothing is really shown but I'm pretty sure there was only one outcome.Overall it was an OK psychological thriller with a good performance from Rosamund Pike. At times the film felt a bit unnecessarily slow and cringe worthy but it is a decent film to watch once if there is nothing else on.6/10.",Return to Sender
28,stephendaxter,"Just a messy bore-fest, with Rosamund Pike",4,28 May 2015,"Return to Sender is a thriller starring Rosamund Pike fresh off her role in Gone Girl which earned her an Oscar nomination. Now although she didn't put in a bad performance in this film, she wont be getting any nominations for this. The plot of this movie was just a complete mess, it kind of had a purpose for the first 15 minutes and looked like it could be a promising film but for the entire rest of the film i had no idea what was happening or why it was happening. Everything about the film just felt very weird and you couldn't like Rosamund Pike's character because of the ridiculously dumb decisions she makes for reasons that you don't understand. Just thinking back on the film there was zero character development for anyone at all for the majority of the film, it is just a series of events that seem to happen then the film moves on to another irrelevant scene and it keeps on doing this until you are bored out of your mind. The film also decides to take a very odd turn in the last act just out of nowhere. All of a sudden the film decides to throw a curveball with absolutely no setup and no foreshadowing that it just seems very out of character. The terrible writing of the plot and characters really let the film down, you cannot get behind any of the characters and everything just seems ridiculous. In the end The directing wasn't bad and was shot pretty well and Rosamund Pike did her best to use her acting talents to try and save the film but it just wasn't enough to save this messy bore-fest. - 3.9",Return to Sender

its not a dull boring dragged out ""slow burn"" not in the slightest, it is however a story of a woman that has been raped,
The slow burn brigade are miraculous, what do they want? the film to start and end with no story in betwixt? this isnt and wasnt meant to be car chases and explosions or wolverine stabbing folk with his magic fingernails! it is a budding hospital worker that gets raped, the rapist gets the jail, then we see her story, her story of getting through her ordeal the only way she knows, the way she thinks best, its a story of how her friends and family cope with her ordeal - especially her father (nick nolte, who stole the show) ,i dont want to go any further with the story (not slow burn) than i have, it will give too much away.
the acting is great , casting is on point, story is totally amazing, and a delicious twist at the end.i have learnt a valuable lesson on imDb with this movie, ignore any wannabe critic that uses ""slow burn"" to review a title.its not the last house on the left, spit on your grave or even hard candy, BUT it is well worth a watch and a very satisfying piece of cinema!",Return to Sender

Why she chooses to is another question? Pike is enchanting as the beautiful self possessed Miranda. Think 'Grace Kelly' without the restrictions of the Hays code. But she is a fantasy in the Hollywood mode because there are hints that Miranda is flawed, maybe broken, and therefore, in spite of her dark eyed beauty, class and brilliance, available to us.

Until the last 15 minutes, I kept wondering where this was going to go; there was a creepy, uncomfortable vibe to the way the relationship between Miranda (Pike) and the convicted-and-released rapist (Shiloh Fernandez) developed.This is no classic, but it's a decently-crafted piece of entertainment that is by turns disturbing, creepy and satisfying. Everyone involved turns in at the least a workmanlike job and, in the case of Pike, a mildly inspired turn.Rosamund Pike has an intense, frightening gaze. Her irises are so dark that they merge with her pupils, making for an all black center to her eyes in many shots. It makes her expression hard to read and gives her a menacing, almost-reptilian quality at times. In opposition to actors whose performances lay bare their emotions or whose mannerisms reveal the inner workings of their minds, hers is opaque and difficult to read.Compared to the entirety of the film and television I have seen in my life, I'd put this in the top 40th percentile.

Pike isn't an actress with a great deal of range, but this is her follow-up to the lead in ""Gone Girl?""

44,salviolog,(Major spoiler warning!) Probably the best depiction of a sociopath ever created on film.,10,29 February 2016,"This movie is probably the most accurate depiction of a sociopath ever created on the big screen. Miranda Wells, ingeniously depicted by the famous ""Gone Girl"" star Rosamund Pike, a nurse in a local hospital, who is a bit odd, but an all around nice person, gets horribly raped by a no good small time criminal William Finn. But, surprisingly enough, instead of hating on Finn, Miranda visits him in prison, and even hires him to fix her porch... then she drugs him, locks him in her basement, tortures him and probably kills him, revealing previously to that that she have let her mother die, and that she enjoys hospital work because it allows her to inflict pain on patients while treating them (much in a fashion of a dentist in ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" musical).Miranda Wells is probably the most accurate depiction of a sociopath ever created on film. Her Oscar-worthy acting in Return to Sender very well answers the question of why people almost never suspect a sociopath serial killer until the body count goes up way too high. With no offense to Anthony Hopkins performance in the series about the psychologist gone murderer, real psychopathic serial killers rarely act like Hannibal Lecter from Silence of the Lambs in real life - they are much more likely to look like Miranda: likable, charming, a bit odd, but nothing more. The movie portrays all these qualities in a very subtle, very cinematic fashion, which works very well: it allows the viewer to profile Miranda, like a detective, which makes ""Return to Sender"" that much more great of a thriller. We know something is coming, but we would never see it. This is why sociopaths are so dangerous, and ""Return to Sender"" does a grade A job at explaining it.",Return to Sender

It wasn't until a third had passed, I finally got it. Gone girl. So I figured that was where the sinister feeling came from. But I didn't expect the twist was going to emerge so early. Was Maranda sending letters to him in prison??? Dubious behavior. ""You win"" was written on the back of the envelope. William, are you getting your hope up again soon after you raped her? OMG, she came to visit in an open back dress. A wicked trap, no doubt about that.Was that about 50mins into the movie? For the rest of the time, I was just counting minutes and yawning. I repeated ""kill him, kill him, just do it..."" for a thousand times silently. There was nothing surprising when he was drugged just like the pitiful dog. Of course, she wanted to revenge. Of course, he being a minor scumbag had no chance to escape her deadly and jerking claws. But, kill someone released on parole just like that? Wasn't he supposed to send weekly reports to authorities? Hadn't anyone seen him working on her porch? Her dad surely did. OK, a father wouldn't rat out his little girl. But didn't she know that William went to the local store for paints? When her dad was venting at her , he was waving the piece of shade guide. There was no way she would miss that. Nevertheless, the fire of revenge was scorching and she was the ultimate predator. If no one else cared about the plot holes, why should she do?The performance was OK. I think the biggest disappointment was that the twist was exposed too early–like I said above. Before anything else, the character of Maranda was too similar to the one in Gone girl. This overlap alone could give away the biggest twist of the movie easily to anyone who recognized her and had some imagination. The ending was also not thought through. She was basically asking for trouble by killing William like that. But, well, that is just typical for these kind of movies. Once the twist is revealed, the class will be over.

I liked the way the movie kept us guessing as to what she was up to, or if she was up to anything at all. This woman is really a great actress. I thought she was amazing in ""Gone Girl"" as well. She has the sociopath character down pat. I honestly thought some of the other actors in this movie paled in comparison to Rosamund's performance, but all in all they did a decent job to keep the suspense going. I didn't even realize it was Nick Nolte who played her father until the end. Hard to believe Nick Nolte is that old now. Bottom line is that I think this is a very good drama/suspense movie with really good acting by the main character.",Return to Sender
57,sallymartin13,Don't waste your time.,3,1 February 2016,"Looked forward to seeing this movie as I'm a fan of Rosamund Pike. Things started off well enough and I thought I was in for a good thriller/revenge type movie. Alas, t'was not meant to be. Can honestly say it's one of the worse movie's I've seen for a while. The acting was good, but the characters were poor and ill defined. But the worst thing was the plot, the plot was ridiculous! There was little or no reason given for any of the significant things that happened. At a particular point in the movie I was beginning to think it was getting a tad weird, could she possibly be having erotic thoughts about her rapist? Anyway, in the end it just goes so left field, without warning or any insight from the character. Was very disappointed to see such a good actor (Pike) in such a bad movie. Do yourself a favor, don't waste your time.",Return to Sender

Guess the moral of this movie is don't speak to people you have seriously wronged or accept drinks from them.

There are several scenes where you should be asking who is plotting against whom. The tricky part is people aren't understanding that the length of the movie and storyline often confuse the actual timeline. It actually spans several years, not just a few Months that people seem to think. Overall if you open your mind and pay attention, it's actually a fairly decent movie.",Return to Sender

And difficult to watch, especially the scenes where she starts meeting her rapist and looks like she's empathizing with him. It's difficult to watch because you don't really know in which direction it's going.But then you learn that she's a psycho. She killed her mother and her father's dog. So, is she seeing a kindred spirit in the rapist?Nope. Once she traps him in her house and surgically removes his hand, you realize this is a revenge movie.At the end of the movie she informs her father that William the rapist will not be coming to the house anymore. It can only mean three things:1. She's let him go and he's so scared he won't come back. Probably the least acceptable explanation.
2. She's killed him. Quite likely.
3. She has him permanently trapped in her house and will spend the next few months or years surgically removing his body parts one by one.Given that she's a complete psycho, I'd go with No. 3.When was the last time a movie made you think so hard. I give it 7 stars.",Return to Sender
61,waterboils,A disgusting and disgraceful morally bereft embarrassment..,1,19 May 2016,"Whatever happened to the concept of having a drawing board?The introduction of the lovely female protagonist, followed by her made-for-TV on-screen rape ordeal, had me awkwardly pessimistic, yet cautiously hopeful for a sensitive handling of such a hideous subject.The victim tracks down and visits the rapist in prison, who demonstrates genuine remorse. Like a true angel of forgiveness- an example to us all, she accepts the olive branch of repentance and displays colossal enormity of heart by forgiving her aggressor. Upon his release, she extends her open-hearted generosity of spirit still further by inviting this newly rehabilitated soul to her home.Whilst he helps her to fix up her house, it transpires that her elaborate plan all along was to ultimately manipulate him into a vigilante revenge trap sting, in order to dispense 'real justice' by rendering him helpless and chopping his bits off etc. At this point, viewers can be forgiven for sympathising with either, neither, or both.The piece completely cheapens, and mishandles the subject of rape and sexual violence. It is abhorrent in its representation of victims of such crimes. It undermines good programs that arrange meetings between perpetrators of crime and their victims. It arguably breeds cynicism towards the principles of rehabilitation, forgiveness and redemption, whilst potentially seeding audience sympathy for an ugly and, sadly, all too common 'eye for an eye' philosophy.I'm sure, looking back, the actors (hopefully), and others involved, are extremely embarrassed to be on record as having been involved in this road-kill movie. Conversely, it wouldn't surprise me to hear that some of those involved were initially misled in relation to its ultimate toxicity...To finish, I'd like to establish that I don't automatically object to movies that have graphic scenes like rape, violence etc. A great example: Lilya 4ever. Bleak. Shocking. Brilliant. There are also many examples of brilliant revenge plots that thrill the rational viewer intelligent enough to suspend their disbelief beyond supporting violent vigilantism outside the world of screen! So... Whatever happened to the concept of having a drawing board?It absolutely astounds me that 'Return to Sender' seemingly never saw one. Apparently it is even playing on Sky Movies, so they seem to be a drawing board short of a shiit flick themselves!Cringe factor 10. Of course, watch and post if you agree, disagree or whatever!

I could feel for her because nobody deserves to be raped: no woman, no man. But killing an innocent animal, the best friend of her father because she was not. She never cared... and still picks the same characters over and over because it comes naturally for her. She is so arrogant, even in ""Pride & Prejudice"". After she killed the dog... everyone thought she deserved what she got, being also nasty to her father, her colleagues, random people. I hope there won't be any sequel. A very bad movie. Just like ""Gone Girl"" with another arrogant actor there, Neil Harris.

I, personally, gave it a 7/10, because I believe it deserves higher ratio than just 5. The slow pace of the story will let the viewer dive deep into the feelings and mind of a victim and at the same time portrays the well known truth - the criminal is a human too, who keeps living his own life, jail or no jail, without ever being able to understand, what devastating damage was done and can never be undone. Revenge is cold indeed. The things I didn't like are few: I am a dog lover, but I get the relevance of this detail to the plot, which kind of let's us predict the ending without it being clearly shown. Also, who is a real psychopath here? The detail about the character's mom makes it hard to sympathize the protagonist for a moment.",Return to Sender

It starts out with a woman being raped, then turns into an attempt at a character study, then ends up a cheesy revenge flick. It's all over the place and never segues any of the different threads in a way that make it watchable. It's a shame to see Pike and Nolte in this, they're way above it. To be fair to them, they both do as well as they can with the material, but it would have been better suited as a movie of the week. Don't waste your time with this one. It sounds interesting, and you think maybe the synopsis is short in case it gives too much away. It's not.

But my main problem with this movie is that she told her rapist,during the two minute torture, that the anti freeze killed her dads dog"".That one line,out of the whole movie,bothered the hell out of me because they never implied that she was going crazy or was some kind of sadistic psycho.She had a good relationship with her dad and we were led to believe that she was taking care of the dog when he got sick.Honestly,after she said that,i wished her rapist broke free and killed her.so anyway,5 and a half really but i gave it 6 cause i like Nick Nolte.",Return to Sender

As a viewer, I felt a little like the father, when he screams to her daughter that she is crazy. but his role just does not impact the movie. Actors are not bad, there are some good scenes,but this does not make it a good movie since the story does not make sens. There is no intrigue, and you fell like the character played by Rosamund Pike is just stupid, until the end where you find out she is crazy for doing all this.

This movie isn't as modern in a sense that the female lead isn't as much of an outgoing 'bitch type', which I was immediately giving Pike's character, and I believe they deliberately played her quiet role a little long so you could stop seeing her as the bitch in 'Gone Girl'. The father character is bit unnecessary, but I still feel this is an awesome movie if you need to feel better about something you're going through.
