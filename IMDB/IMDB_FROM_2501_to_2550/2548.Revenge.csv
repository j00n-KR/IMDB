0,SnoopyStyle,French grindhouse,6,5 October 2018,"Three rich entitled executives have their annual hunting trip at their remote desert retreat. Stan and Dimitri are surprised that the married Richard has brought along his lollipop mistress Jen. While Richard is away, she gets raped and the situation escalates.The whole rape section is creepy good and intense. The cliff is unbelievable in a bad way. How she survives and escapes is very unlikely. When the guys return to find her missing, my first thought would be an animal had dragged her body off into the wilderness. It's unreal that their only thought is that she walked away somehow. The excessive ass shots are excessive but that's a choice the director has made. There are some good B-movie fun like the branding. There are some ups and downs about the competency of Jen. At some moments, she's like a world beater. At other times, she does some silly mistakes. This is a fair bloody grindhouse action thriller.",Revenge
1,kosmasp,No holds barred,7,4 July 2018,"Straight from the beginning the camera let's us know and tempts us with views of a beautiful young woman, just strutting around. As you can read in the outlines someone thinks this is an invitation. Which of course it isn't ... and it's really one of those things that most often than not break movies for me. And while the movie does not shy back to depict that violent attack, it does not go all Irreversible on us the viewers.But as the title suggests, we do get some redemption and we do get a lot of blood and violent acts. This is definitely not for the faint hearted or squeamish. This really is graphic and I would guess a it unrealistic (or hyper realistic?). Whatever you want to call it, the second half is where the ""fun"" is at (again, remember this is just a movie and I'm obviously not advocating or rooting for that sort of behaviour in any way, shape or form). With that in mind, sit back, relax and enjoy the mayhem",Revenge
2,Tweekums,Suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride,9,1 July 2019,"As this thriller, from writer/director Coralie Fargeat, opens Jen and her wealthy, married boyfriend Richard fly to a house he owns deep in the North African desert. They enjoy a night of passion but she is shocked in the morning when she sees two men with guns outside the window. It turns out they are Richard's friends Stan and Dmitri who arrived a day early for a hunting expedition. That evening that all have a pleasant time together but the next morning Stan rapes Jen while Richard is away. When he gets back she demands that he call the helicopter to take her home; she also threatens to tell his wife... things now turn very dangerous for Jen; she is chased to a cliff-edge and Richard pushes her over. Somehow she survives, with serious injuries. The three men go to retrieve her body but upon realising she survived determine to hunt her down... if she is to survive she will have to turn the tables on them.If you can't suspend your disbelief, a lot, you won't enjoy this. Characters carry on after sustaining injuries that would almost certainly kill let alone incapacitate them. If you can get past this you are in for a treat though. The film is very taut and at times shockingly bloody. Just the right amount of time is spent introducing the characters before things get nasty. Thankfully not too much of the rape is shown although the run up to it is disturbing. Once Jen is pushed over the cliff and the hunt begins it gets pretty gruelling. We don't just have the required deaths; there is also the sight of Jen cauterising her wound and another character pulling broken glass from his foot... I confess I had to look away during the latter! When gory things aren't happening we are treated to some fantastic shots of the desert on Morocco. The dialogue is fairly sparse; just enough to establish what is going on, we don't get characters giving speeches before trying to kill each other. The cast do a fine job; particularly Matilda Lutz who is great as Jen making the character believable in what should be an unbelievable situation. Overall this certainly won't be for everybody but if you enjoy the genre it is a real treat.",Revenge
3,BA_Harrison,Jen's a bad-ass with a nice ass.,8,16 December 2018,"To fully enjoy a film like Revenge, it is best to forget all about realism: this is an ultra-violent exercise in stylish comic-book excess, where characters can sustain all manner of extreme injuries but still fight on. For some, suspending disbelief will prove too much of an ask, but for those who revel in OTT gore-drenched exploitation, the film should prove very satisfying. It doesn't hurt, of course, that the protagonist is a total babe with a 'peachy ass' that gets quite a lot of screen time.The exquisite derriere in question belongs to Italian actress Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz, who plays Jen, mistress of successful businessman Richard (Kevin Janssens), who flies her out to his swish desert retreat for a weekend of extra-marital hanky panky. The weekend turns sour when sexy Jen is raped by Stan (Vincent Colombe), one of Richard's hunting pals, who takes her flirtatious dancing as a come on. When Richard discovers what has happened, he tries to buy Jen's silence with a job in Canada and a sum of cash. Jen is appalled and threatens to tell Richard's wife of his indiscretions. Big mistake: Richard, Stan and fellow hunter Dimi (Guillaume Bouchède) chase Jen into the desert, where she is pushed off a cliff and impaled on the pointy end of an old tree.Despite a gaping wound in her back and stomach, and the loss of gallons of blood, Jen somehow survives, and crawls to safety before Richard and company can come to deal with her body. When the men find Jen missing, they try to hunt her down, but don't count on her being such a bad-ass: after patching up her wound with the help of some peyote and a hot beer can, she goes looking for payback.Directed by Coralie Fargeat, this brutal rape revenge flick not only delivers bucketloads of graphic violence and countless shots of Lutz's immaculate butt, but it also looks stunning throughout (at times, reminding me of recent Nic Cage movie Mandy, only nowhere near as pretentious or boring). Every shot is beautifully rendered; preposterous cinematic savagery has rarely looked so good. The blood-drenched finale paints the screen red and, in order to maintain sexual equality, features plenty of shots of Janssens' tuckus (as well as his junk).7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for lovely Lutz, who looks a lot like a young Jessica Alba, which isn't a bad thing.",Revenge
4,searchanddestroy-1,"Juicy, bloody, tasty...",9,17 February 2018,"But also a little disgusting from time to time. Anyway, I highly appreciated this French thriller, in the line of LAISSEZ BRONZER LES CADAVRES and shot in Morocco. The aesthetics is very important here, as it was in thje other movie I just mentioned. You have here a sort of aesthetics you can find in the modern TV episodes. This is a brutal, gritty, taut film which I recommand for the fans of this type of cinema. The climax is excellent.",Revenge
5,morrison-dylan-fan,"""The desert is sublime, but merciless with the careless.""",10,18 April 2020,"A few years ago I had Mark Kermode's YouTube channel playing in the background, and my attention was suddenly caught by what looked like a super stylish French Horror. Having made a note of the flick,I was thrilled to spot during my free 30 days on Shudder,that the title was on as a exclusive, leading to me going out for revenge.View on the film:Not saying one line of dialogue after the opening 30 minutes, Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz gives a utterly mesmerizing performance as Jen. Spending a huge part of the title on her own in the desert with yelps of pain and avenging screams being the lone sounds filling the silence, Lutz brings a subtle quality to the flick, in her body language change from Jen being a free and open Valley Girl, into a battle warrior who destroys all that stand in her way.Roaring this feature film debut into life with helicopter rotors being washed over in guitar licks, writer/director Coralie Fargeat & cinematographer Robrecht Heyvaert ignite a blazing ultra-stylised deconstruction of the Rape/Revenge Horror genre. Greeting Jen, Richard, Stan and Dimitri in a sun-kissed villa, Fargeat takes real precession in taking the gratuitous skin sleaze out of the genre, via holding the camera up-close to Jen's agonising face during the rape.Becoming reborn when left for dead in the desert,Fargeat melts the sun-kiss villa of the opening 30 minutes into cranked up hyper-stylisation, whipping up the over saturated burnt colours to Robin Coudert's buzzing score plunging into Jen's burning rush for revenge. Slicing into gripping Body Horror from Jen's symbolic withdrawal of a branch impaled within her, allowing for new blood to flow and a phoenix to rise.Fargeat binds the dusty colours with ultra-stylisation twisting the New Wave of French Horror into blood-drenched long corridor tracking shots, and battle cry overlapping dissolves jabbed with jagged jump-cuts closing in on Jen's eye for revenge.",Revenge
6,trashgang,throwback to the grindhouse,8,9 May 2020,"The score used, that made me think of those good old days in the eighties en seventies. The era of grindhouse, slashers or even revenge flicks. On the other hand, sometimes it even made me think of the cult classic 'A Clockwork Orange (1971)'.The flick itself, a pure revenge flick , a no-brainer because what happens to the girl is almost impossible to survive. But what does makes it a delight, the gore, ultra-gore. Gorehounds should check it out. And for the females wtaching this, yes, Kevin his dingalong is watchable more than once.I liked it very much, the movie I mean. Didn't expect it to be that gory.

7,Hellmant,Really does a good job of capturing that classic grindhouse feel!,9,24 August 2018,"'REVENGE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A French rape and revenge thriller about the mistress of a wealthy CEO, who's raped, and then left for dead, by his rich friends on their annual hunting trip. She of course survives the attack though, and seeks a very violent and bloody revenge. The movie was written and directed by first time feature filmmaker Coralie Fargeat, and it stars Matilda Lutz, Kevin Janssens, Vincent Colombe and Guillaume Bouchède. It's gotten mostly rave reviews from critics, and I enjoyed it mostly as well. The film is very simple, with very little dialogue or character development, but it's definitely really intense, involving and disturbing as well obviously. We learn to really hate the bad guys, and root for the heroine, with very little dialogue or knowing much about them. The film is really stylistic and gritty too! For a first time director, Fargeat really does a good job of capturing that classic grindhouse feel, while she also makes if feel somewhat fresh and original at the same time. I look forward to seeing her next film as well.",Revenge
8,FeastMode,my notes,6,26 July 2019,I liked it. surprisingly well made for a low-budget foreign indy flick. great visuals and cinematography. lots of long takes creating suspense. definitely some dumb stuff and questionable parts. but overall entertaining. very grindhouse-y. (1 viewing),Revenge
9,Pjtaylor-96-138044,It knows exactly what it's doing.,8,9 January 2020,"'Revenge (2017)' is a movie that knows exactly what it's doing, ferociously reclaiming a notoriously objectifying genre. Writer-director Fargeat displays an in-depth knowledge of not only genre but cinema as a whole, helming her story with a real mastery of craft. The film begins in rather stereotypical fashion, tinted in orange and teal with camera-work that favours the lead actor's backside over her face. Basically, it's more 'male gaze'-y than most overtly 'male gaze' movies. This is by intention, though, as it sets up a brutal, subversive experience targeted directly at the pictures it initially parodies. After her near-supernatural resurrection, the lead is no longer objectified in a sexual way. In fact, you could make the argument that she's still objectified, with no dialogue after the 26-minute mark, but as an object of vengeance, filmed with the same power-favouring cinematography as someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger. She's broken, battered and bad-ass, surviving incredible odds with sheer will-power and markedly quick thinking. The prey becomes the predator, but the piece doesn't necessarily feel as thought it revels in its relatively gruesome violence (a scene depicting a foot wound is particularly wince-inducing). Instead, it depicts revenge as survival, irreversibly tying the two acts together. This is a masterful stroke as it makes sure you're always on the side of the protagonist, even while the narrative goes to lengths to humanise its villains and give them their own pseudo-arcs. The filmmaking always remains on fine form, making great use of visual metaphors and assured editing. It's never quite what you expect, expanding on its limited set-up in remarkably satisfying ways. It's so well-conceived that it often provokes smiles, despite its subject matter being rather heavy. It's compelling throughout and usually just as entertaining. It's also decidedly feminist, which is refreshing to say the least. It's great. 8/10",Revenge
10,ThomasDrufke,Had to Put Up a Fight,9,17 January 2019,"This is a film I wish I would have watched before I made my favorite films of 2018 list, because there's no doubt it would have flirted with my top 10 for sure. Viscerable, gorgeous, colorful, sexy, thrilling, and most of all - rightfully unsettling - Revenge earns what the title presents itself as, a balls to the wall bonkers thrill ride for a full 110 minutes. This is the feature length debut of director Coralie Fargaet and boy oh boy does she have a career ahead of her. Her direction, perhaps above anything else, is the biggest takeaway from Revenge. Ranging from cringy gore during the main characters fall in the first act, to a brutally intense chase through the desert, Fargeat establishes a unique tone and feel to Revenge, and it's extremely impressive considering the layered subject matter. And THAT long take/oner towards the end, WOW. This is a true accomplishment from Fargeat.9.3/10",Revenge
11,westsideschl,Bloody Hell,7,21 August 2018,"Opening credits: Strong bloody gruesome violence. OK, now you know. 
I may have missed the location while watching, but presumably it's Morocco. Basic script: Three wealthy men meet for a hunting trip w/hight tech gear (What's there to hunt in a desert anyway?). The owner of the house (Why is there this big modern expensive lone house in a vast desert? What is the water, and electricity source?) Anyway, girlfriend is there for just a brief stay (Must say the director did choose a visually seductive actress for this role which, of course, was amply filmed.) Our males turn out to be not the nicest people in the world. 
Will not give away the story, but negatives include how one survives a 100' fall; gets impaled by a stick; leaves a trail of blood a mile long; then fights like a pro.",Revenge
12,paulclaassen,"Incredibly well done, but NOT for the squeamish!",6,22 April 2019,"The first thing you'll notice is the awesome cinematography and photography. I mean, this film takes close-up photography (and photography in general) to the next level. Yup, 'Revenge' has just raised the bar!The photography is very sensual at times, and excellently depicts the way men desirably look at women. As an added bonus, they also feature male nudity - very naturally done - as Richard (Kevin Janssens) is nude for large parts of the movie. The nudity is very tastefully done, though, but we haven't seen it done quite like this before.Let's be honest, this is not everyone's cup of tea and you have to select your audience very carefully. This is a very, very graphic film. It is not necessarily a horror because of what happens, but due to the incredible close-up photography. This film literally gets under your skin. There are numerous highly disturbing images. I often found myself watching through parted fingers, with my feet curled up to rest my chin on my knees. Yup, this film is definitely NOT for the squeamish.I do have a few credibility issues with the film. Jen (Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz) was impaled by a tree, yet she sets the tree on fire on order to break free! (What!!??). What was the chance of her burning to a crisp before managing to topple the tree? With the wounds she suffered, she would have been in a lot more pain than she appeared to be, and was far too mobile still. Yes, they do give an explanation as to how she managed to suppress the pain and that helped a bit in accepting her mobility and manageability. (But not entirely, due to the amount of blood she lost). They also show us how she attends to her stomach wound, but how did she manage to take care of her back?Despite these and a few other issues, this is a film that will definitely leave an impression on you - whether you hate it or like it. The impact of the film is far too great to ignore. This is a hard-hitting film, and it hits you where it hurts most! (Why so much blood in the film, though?)The South African film 'Hunting Emma' or 'Jagveld' - also released in 2017 - has a very similar theme (just not as graphic). I can't help but wonder who was first.",Revenge
13,cruise01,A B movie with a title that says it all with what you can expect.,8,10 August 2018,"Revenge (4 out of 5 stars).Revenge says it all with the plot. It is a French movie with most subtitles and some in English. It is that rape and revenge action film. It is bloody, gritty, and can be disturbing. But seeing Matilda Lutz being a flirty, wanting to be a star personality to being a gun toting bada** female is awesome. Revenge feels like an experimental type of film. It has its style with low dialogue script, cinematography work that tries to capture a perfect lighting/shadow setting, and an electronic music score by Rob. The plot begins with Jen (Matilda Lutz) flying with a French millionaire Richard (Kevin Janssens) to a distant and isolated home in the middle of the desert. They begin their affair when Richard told his wife and kids he is out on a hunting trip with his friends. When his friends Stan and Dimitri show up. They have a wild night party. When Richard is out away. Stan rapes Jen. When Richard finds out, he does not care. He tries to bribe Jen from keeping it to herself. She escapes and is pushed off the cliff and falling to her death when she gets impaled by a dead tree. She survives the fall and severely wounded. And the three man find out she is out there in the desert alive. They go hunting for her while she prepares to go on revenge on all three men. The film is very fast moving. The opening scene with the reflection on Richard's sunglasses on a helicopter and Jen's queen B attitude. The film focuses on Jen's development and how she is affected from the assault. She suffers through a lot but gets back up to stop those men from getting away with what they have done. Next thing you know she is picking one guy off at a time as they are out in the desert with their off road bikes and jeep looking for her. Be aware, the movie is bloody and graphic. Especially, the self-patching the wounds. And the bloody climax of the movie were Jen and Richard are shooting at each other in a house with shot guns. And a dizzying chase in the house with the hallways getting more bloody as they encounter each other. And also the nudity feels more gratuitous with a nude guy fighting Jen. The movie does have its style with its electronic music. With plenty of camera angle butt shots when Jen is wearing skimpy outfits or her bloody warrior look in the final half hour of the movie. Matilda Lutz is a beautiful actress. Seeing her become a bloody fierce warrior is amazing. Her performance is outstanding. I would like to see her do more films. Overall, Revenge is a good action thriller. The direction has a sense of feminine power and a stylish outlook with music, camera angles, and lighting. The plot is a simple revenge story. It is a gritty and bloody movie. It can be intense in some scenes.",Revenge
14,eddie_baggins,A blood soaked and stylish revenge flick,6,9 October 2018,"If you've seen one revenge movie, you've seen them all and while French film Revenge doesn't mess with the well-worn formula, this blood soaked and stylishly filmed low-budget effort does enough to warrant a viewing, especially for those horror aficionados seeking out their next blood soaked female orientated bought of violent retribution.Focussing on Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz's wannabe actress Jen, who on a getaway/boys hunting trip with her wealthy married company man boyfriend Richard (played loathsomely by a very game Kevin Janssens) and his two creepy friends Stan and Dimitri, finds herself in a battle of life and death after she's taken advantage of and left for dead making Revenge is a neon-drenched desert set experience that isn't for the faint of heart.Directed by debut female filmmaker Coralie Fargeat, Revenge is filled with ominous foreboding as Jen's seemingly good-time filled world is turned upside down in an instance, as we as an audience get thrown into her bloody journey from dancing free-spirit to Lara Croft looking, gun-toting one-woman army.It's a fever dream like experience, not unlike one you'd expect to find from a filmmaker such as Nicholas Winding Refn as where thrown headfirst into Fargeat's film that isn't looking to take any prisoners and Revenge is unafraid to shock, slice and savage its way through its at times bogged-down runtime with a collection of hardcore experiences that culminates in one of the year's most bloody finales.There's beatings, bruising, shootings and self-surgeries' as Revenge trots along its path as it well and truly earns its adults only rating.Overcoming it's at times stale scripting and suspect supporting turns from Vincent Colombe and Guillaume Bouchède as Stan and Dimitri, Revenge also unearths a real gem of a performance from Lutz who embodies Jen with a powerful will and determination and is game to embrace the films often unbelievable and over the top moments to help give Revenge a steely determination to complete its goal as a cinematic offering.Final Say - Filled with just enough originality and style to separate itself from the revenge pack, Revenge is a hard-boiled and often horrific tale of justice served cold. Not for those that don't like their movies drenched in copious claret, Revenge ends up becoming one of the year's more memorable horror/thriller offerings and marks down director Fargeat and star Lutz as a talents to keep an eye on.3 heated cans out of 5",Revenge
15,TheMovieDiorama,Revenge stylises its exploitation sub-genre through bloody cinematography.,7,8 March 2019,"The old classic ""rape and revenge"" sub-genre that can bring an entire family of sadistic individuals together on the sofa devouring snacks. Yes, much like 'I Spit On Your Grave' and 'Last House On The Left', there is plenty of revenge. But what differentiates this visceral sensory experience from them is the grounded realism and well-executed thrills. No elaborate torture traps are built, just a woman's natural instinct for survival. An American socialite is having an affair with a married man, and during his absence she gets raped by an associate of his and is left for dead when pushed off a cliff. She survives, recovers and, as the title suggests, seeks revenge on her attackers.This is a predictable and formulaic narrative, it does not set out to change the sub-genre it resides in. Instead, it embellishes it. Through Fargeat's clean direction and Heyvaert's gorgeous cinematography, the synthesised aesthetic appeal is enhanced to create a new set of thrills. Even the film's score soaks itself in French synth-pop. It captures the social class that our protagonist belongs in, and boy does she have a bad two days. Blood is everywhere. I'm talking Tarantino levels. The makeup was extraordinary, leaving me squeamish and turning my head away as an attacker removes a shard of glass lodged into his foot (no thank you!).However, you have to suspend your disbelief on multiple occasions. Some wounds, such as falling off a cliff and being impaled by a tree, would be certain of causing death. Even with the absurd amount of blood loss. Yet, she gets on up and continues on with her day. The character of Jen also lacks depth and natural development. One minute she is prancing around in her skimpy bikini, the next becoming Lara Croft of the desert. For a film that has a ""feminist spin"" to it, it didn't exactly start off appropriately. Fortunately it shifts into the right direction in the second half. So, Revenge is not intelligently changing the formula that it utilises, it embraces it. Stylish, visceral and a bloody good time!",Revenge

Some may jus laugh out loud n get entertained. In one lol scene a male runs naked a la American Psycho.

17,imseeg,Female action hero goes wild in a gorefest killing spree. Equals Tarantino in gore and riveting suspense. A few plot turn flaws are the only let down.,8,3 February 2019,"If you think Quentin Tarantino's violence is repulsive, you should better skip this movie. Wow, this is definitely something else and then some!I just wanted to see an action movie on a lazy Sunday. I tried out several (boring) hollywood formala action movies, until I accidentally stumbled upon this French movie (mostly english spoken), with a story about a woman who swears revenge after a man had ""mistreated"" her. (What actually happened is better left a surprise to avoid spoilers). That story sounded exciting, but I hadnt expected it to be THIS shockingly stumach turning. In the most thrilling way though!Beware, it is not only a gorefest. Not at all. Just as in any great Tarantino movie, the violence part is only small, yet very realisticly portrayed so I had to look away, many times. There are many other things besides the gore, that lifts this movie far above the usual standard action movie. Great photography for one. I mean instantly I recognized the playfulness and originality with which was filmed. What a joy to watch. Great distorted synthesizer music score as well, which really mesmirised me.Great intrigueing and suspenseful start of the story, with great true to life dialogues and the characters are true to life as well (most of the time). Good acting from these unknown actors! There are a few ridiculous plot turns though, which make it a lot less believable at certain points, which is a bit of a shame, but the suspense is constantly running at such high levels, that I willingly took these few story plot turn flaws for granted. I would have given it 9 stars without these few unbelievable plot turn flaws.Definitely wanna see this ""chick flick"" again. ""Revenge"" is riveting, thrilling and stumach turning from beginning to end. What a ride! Highly recommended. Equals the best of Tarantino in gore, suspense and female power. ""Booyah!""",Revenge

19,jtindahouse,Another brilliant French film,9,18 May 2018,"'Revenge' has very much a 'I Spit on Your Grave' feel to it. It's a different film in a lot of ways, but the general atmosphere of both films is very similar. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned after all. There's something endlessly satisfying about seeing a woman who has been disgustingly wronged get her swift and brutal vengeance. It doesn't undo what has happened to her, but it goes a wee way towards bettering things. This movie blew me away. I love French films because they seem to find a way to keep things extremely simple, while having endless layers of complexity hidden under the surface. This may not be the greatest example of that out there, but it's certainly still got traces of it. The main actress Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz did a phenomenal job. She transformed from harmless, sweet, innocent girl into a superpower that you would not want to cross. When we were first introduced to her I was slightly worried she might be a weak element to the film. By the end of the film there was no doubt that she was the strongest element the film possessed. The violence is extreme - and you wouldn't want it any other way. You do need to highly increase your suspension of belief for one element of the movie (you'll know exactly what I'm referring to if you've seen the movie). There was no shame on the film-makers part in terms of this component of the story though. They owned it, and for that reason I was fully willing to permit it. This is an incredibly fun film that will stick with you long after the credits have rolled.",Revenge
20,billcr12,Stupid,3,21 June 2018,"Revenge is a waste of time. It is an obvious redo of I Spit on Your Grave, about forty years later. The latter is a better film. A helicopter lands at a remote house in an unknown country. A young woman who is apparently the mistress of the owner, gets it on with him at the beginning. Two friends or associates; it is never explained, show up with rifles and shotguns without explanation. The main guy leaves for a while and one of his buddies has an encounter with the man's mistress. When he returns, she is very unhappy about her involuntary coupling. She wants to go home. The boyfriend has other ideas and it all leads up to a silly and predictable bloody conclusion. The acting is bad. The story is stupid, and there is no reason at all to watch this nonsense.",Revenge

Somehow she's survives being pushed off a very high, rocky cliff and impaled on the branch of a tree at the bottom (very silly) and embarks on a campaign of revenge. Very gory, brutal and bloody revenge. Gore fans will not be disappointed. Acting is pretty good, as is the musical score. And there is much impressive camera work, whether it be a close up of an insect or the Moroccan desert filming locations. Aside from being far fetched I also felt that at 108 minutes it was too long. However, as rape/revenge movies go this French effort goes right for the jugular! A dilemma that I have is that this movie is so over the top that it is absurdly amusing - but is it right to be laughing at a film about rape and a woman's quest for retribution? I'm personally not sure.",Revenge

23,Chris_Docker,Exceeds expectation,8,15 March 2021,"I just watched a cracker of an inventive gore shocker. It starts misleadingly like some exploitation flick with a flirtatious girlie who will almost certainly get a pretty bad deal from three macho guys in isolated surroundings (title suggests she'll get her own back etc).What makes it stand apart for me is the incentive depictions of gory injuries coupled with superb editing to make the audience jump - plus a throbbing soundtrack (no pun intended) that produces an unsettling effect throughout (think Christopher Nolan, Gaspar Noé's Irreversible or Beberian Sound Studio) at least once the intro section has finished. Works best loud or with headphones.There's a few character holes - for instance, how does a ditzy young woman suddenly turn into fast-witted and resourceful character worthy of a marine; and injuries that would reduce most people to a blubbering mass on a hospital bed are almost brushed off with deft plot developments( yet these are standard for the genre and don't spoil the enjoyment.Some of the gore is almost Tarantino-esque - Deathproof without the geeky, obscure cinematic references every 60 seconds, sometimes tongue-in-cheek: yet it's the suspense rather than the large amounts of blood that make it mildly spectacular.Unlike most films that follow a similar 'revenge' theme, the characters are fairly well-developed for an action flick. The desert photography (it was filmed in the Moroccan Sahara) is quite stunning and frames any and all things not sand or rock with vivid immediacy - blood oozing onto desert ants or the sun on a swimming pool in the midst of barren wilderness.I can't help wondering if a woman in the director's seat was responsible pulling together a taut film that ultimately manages to avoid exploiting either woke 'feminism' or chauvinistic sadism: ultimately it's just a good thriller with plenty of thought rather than excess of CGI.",Revenge

25,Pairic,No run of the mill gore film,9,23 May 2018,"Revenge: Vengeance is something which is integral to the Irish Psyche so a film titled Revenge does carry a certain attraction for me. In this tale, Jen (Matilda Lutz) travels with her wealthy married boyfriend Richard (Kevin Janssens) to his remote hunting lodge situated in high desert scrubland. Unexpectedly Richard's two friends turn up early for a planned hunt. When Richard goes to collect hunting permits, one of the hunters rapes Jen. Richard wants to cover things up and offers Jen money and a new job but when she threatens to contact his wife he turns violent and eventually pushes her off of a cliff.Jen survives and the hunt is on. But even these three experienced hunters find tracking down Jen no easy task as she turns the tables on them. Through desert, a river, scrubland and mountains the chase continues but who is really being hunted? This is a disturbing film but Jen is no victim and Revenge is not a run of the mill gore film. But there is plenty of blood spilled, initially as Jen is injured and yet more as she tends to her wounds (with the help of peyote) and strikes back in some disturbing scenes. Tension is maintained until the end as the duel continues.Some convincing acting by Lutz and Janssens with Lutz in particular shining like a warrior woman. Directed and written by Coralie Fargeat, Revenge has some great desert and chase shots, also the cat and mouse battle in the mountains is superbly captured by cinematographer Robrecht Heyvaert. The spare dialogue in French and English makes clear the imbalance of power at all stages between Jen and the three men, bringing to mind Marlina The Murderer In Four Acts. 8.5/10",Revenge

28,TdSmth5,Bloody fun,8,18 August 2019,"Richard takes his lovely mistress Jen to his hunting mansion out in the desert, by chopper. Later two creepy hunting buddies of his show up. What they aim to hunt out in the desert armed with huge automatic rifles and sniper rifles who knows. The only creatures we see are bugs. At night the drink, Jen dances for them, she tries to dance with Richard but he's not interested so she dances seductively with one of the creeps. Next morning Richard is gone and the creep comes on to Jen misunderstanding what happened the night before. Because Jen is not interested in his advances he decides to rape her. When Richard returns he's not particularly supportive when she threatens to call his wife he gets angry at her. She runs away, the other 3 chase her. At the edge of a cliff Richard pushes her and he falls impaling herself on a tree. Later she wakes up and manages to free herself. When the guys go looking for the body, they don't find her and start to hunt her. At this point Jen gets into revenge mode and starts hunting her hunters. Things get very bloody.Revenge is a pretty minimalist movie with a 4+1 cast members in the mansion or out in the desert. The introductory part is pretty short before the violence begins. Even though this movie is longer than necessary it doesn't come across as such. Fargeat's retro directing style keeps things interesting and fun even when there isn't a whole lot going on. I could have done without all the bugs though. Fortunately and surprisingly, most of the movie doesn't take place at night, not even the climax/ending. Additionally, cinematography keeps things bright, colorful, and looking great. As expected though, not a whole lot if said once the action begins. It helps though when the lead is as lovely as Matilda Lutz. Too bad we get to see her at her cutest only for a short time.Revenge is quite remarkable reminding me of the good old days of extreme French horror. It's also a tremendous debut for director Fargeat.",Revenge
29,s3276169,Visually engaging.......,7,14 May 2018,"Generally speaking I dislike revenge style flicks. I Spit On Your Grave and its modern incantations were for me simply too gory and on a certain level, repulsive.Revenge manages the gore factor by toning down the excesses of many of its counterparts. Its got its blood and guts but its not by the bucketful Equally, much as the key female protagonist might be out for her ounce of flesh, the approach is not overtly or creatively sadistic. Balancing the violence of this film is a certain style and artistic flair. There's some real cleverness in the use of visuals. The ants creeping over a partly eaten apple is an interesting metaphor that hints at what's to come in the first quarter of the film. The clever transformation of the female lead from urbanised party goer to feral mud smeared gun toting wild woman, is handled with a certain care that shows in the final product. Given this film is in one sense rather basic in terms of its story and narrative the fact I rate it quite highly is a testament to how effectively visuals and action have been married up to produce a really engaging experience. 7/10 from me.",Revenge
30,peterp-450-298716,A revenge-movie at best. Bloody with stylish footage.,7,22 June 2018,"Even for your tiny little oyster brain, it shouldn't be too difficult to understand.
So, I'll ask you again.
Did my height change since yesterday ?I was watching ""Revenge"" already for a while and I was still wondering who played Richard. I was stunned when I found out it's Kevin Janssens. He appeared on Belgian Television for years in well-known Belgian TV series such as ""Vermist"" and recently ""Salamander"". I was completely surprised to see this Belgian actor in a sadistic, partly French-spoken revenge film à la ""I spit on your grave"". That's one thing I was enthusiastic about. But to be honest, I thought the film was sometimes a bit too much.For many, a rape-revenge movie is not exactly something they were waiting for. Personally I thought ""I spit on your grave"" was a bit too disgusting to watch and the rape scene was too realistic. In fact, this last shocking film can be divided into two parts. The revenge part is almost equivalent in time to the terrible first part. On that level I found ""Revenge"" more bearable and the woman-unfriendly part is more limited in time. The survival and revenge part covers most of the film. But this part is so full of improbabilities and exaggerated actions that it seems rather laughable.Do you believe that films made by Quentin Tarantino such as ""Kill Bill"" or ""From dusk till dawn"" use a ridiculous amount of blood on screen? Well, you'll be surprised here. The main characters have an impressive amount of blood. I'm sure that employees of a blood bank will burst into tears at the sight of all that wasted life-juice. Vincent Castiglia could paint a mega-oeuvre with it. The blood flows in such amount, that I felt they should wear some flip-flops so that they wouldn't start sliding and break their neck. Admittedly, I like films that are rather bloody. But this was also a little bit over the top.And that wasn't the only thing I looked at in disbelief. At one point it seemed as if I had been catapulted back to my youth, watching an episode of ""Roadrunner"". With Jen (Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz) as poor Wile E. Coyote, who always got his butt kicked. No matter what this cartoon figure had to endure (a chest of dynamite that exploded in his hands or a gigantic rock that crushed him into a dime), the darn coyote appeared in the next fragment intact again. Similarly Jen, who makes a fall which was (in my opinion) impossible to survive. And the gruesome wound, which is fatal for most victims, didn't seem to bother her that much anymore after a while. Let alone how she resolves this painful problem. But this, and other, nauseating, bloody scenes ensure that little bit of realism.In itself, ""Revenge"" isn't really a film that only revolves around revenge. For Jen, the most important thing is to survive and not to get caught by these ruthless hunters. The fact that these macho men ultimately find themselves on the short end, isn't only because of their overconfidence and underestimating their female opponent, but also because Jen's self-defense instinct comes into effect. I also thought it was fantastic how the film completely transforms the image of Jen. From a lascivious, scantily clad and temptingly dancing, self-confident young woman, into a wounded and fierce fighting female Rambo with a hell of a killer instinct. From sex object to a dangerous Lara Croft. Matilda Lutz, for me a totally unknown actress, fits perfectly in both roles.Don't expect a revenge movie to be filled with intellectual dialogues and a magnificent storyline. The principle is dead simple. An individual is abused in a certain way. She or he manages to escape from his or her attackers. And then takes revenge as cruel as possible. The only thing that can distinguish such a film from similar films, is the creativity and the gore being used during the revenge sequences. ""Revenge"" still has an additional asset. And that's the way in which everything was imaged. The shimmeringly hot, golden brown desert that contrasts with bright colors. Like the pink and blue windows in the weekend house. The light blue leather jacket from Richard (Kevin Janssens) and the red sexy bikini from Jen. But especially the richly flowing bright red colored blood. And all of this is done together with a subtle montage of short close-up fragments such as a rotting apple, ants hiding for dripping blood, someone chewing a bar of chocolate, the shadow of moving jeeps and the urinating on a desert insect. In short, an ugly story wrapped in a stylistic framework. In this time of indictments against improper sexual behavior, ""Revenge"" will be the cause of a lot of discussions. I only hope that the members of the ""Me Too"" movement, won't apply such practices on their assailants.",Revenge

33,rockman182,Revenge (2018),7,12 May 2018,"Briefly heard about this film a few weeks back and wanted to see it as soon as possible. Rape and revenge films are often good. I like A Spit on Your Grave (the original) quite a lot because of how effective it is and how powerful the revenge portion is. Same with the original Last House on the Left. This one is a mix of French and English and does a decent enough job while not holding back on the violence and gore which makes it ane effective take.The film is about a girl named Jennifer who is having an affair with a French millionaire named Richard. They have a getaway in a home in the desert, where Richard's two hunting friends also stop by. Richard's friends ogle at Jennifer and eventually one of them rapes her. Richard's course of action is to try to kill Jennifer by pushing her off a cliff. Somehow, She survives even though she is impaled . She then recovers and attempts to get revenge on the three men.Matilda Lutz stars, who people will remember from the very bad Rings. She is a fairly good star in this though. The rape scene itself isn't so hard to watch, its not as disturbing as something you'd see in I Spit on your Grave or Cannibal Holocaust. There is a lot of blood including showing fresh wounds with plenty of blood, stabbing in the eye, and heads getting blown off. This is all fine as it makes the film feel cartoony but in a good way. Its a necessary balance. The films tone isn't really ever super serious as its sparse on dialogue and is more hallucinogenic.Revenge basically meets the expectations that the trailer sets for it. Its not an acting clinic, but the stars get the job done and its a really simple rape and revenge film executed successfully. You can say the film has a real feminist element to it as displayed by the journey and development of the leading star and the change in her character. I'd say its worth a watch if you can stomach it.6.5/10",Revenge

35,rzajac,bloody and irrelevant,4,15 January 2019,"Weird flick. Nice visual stylizing, shot-by-shot. Odd choice to mix French and English. I guess it was a effort to shoehorn a pretense of european classiness into a marketing-driven ""need"" to play to an English-speaking demographic.They started with a sure-fire premise, which was essentially a ""spit on your grave""-type story rehash. But the script was written by a hack, and the direction/production thought they could just run with it. But that never really works: The scripted weirdnesses shine right on through. There were all these little childish touches, like an eye-rolling take on ""peyote"", recovering from solar plexus impalement, makeshift cauterization in lieu of stitches, unlikely character glitches, a furtive ""search party"" sequence that wasn't blocked in a way that built tension and momentum, ... and other stuff.And I know that in the current day we have to be careful about this, but as you assimilate the character ""development"", some modulated slut-shaming is not uncalled-for. I suppose you could say this part of the character development cleverly pointed to an ""all-creatures-great-and-small"" moral imperative--that is, even sluts deserve basic decent treatment. But I'm not sure I bought into that. And I'm NOT saying the ""slut deserved what she got."" I'm saying that she is ""who she is"", and however you want to label her is trumped by the overriding factor that she appears to self-identify as a piece of meat from frame one. So the scenario creates a challenge for the filmmaker: Can she(?!) convince us to discover a redemption of the woman *in her own heart*. That's the best I can offer, and I daresay the filmmaker fails on this. To me, she morphs from a piece of meat into a pissed-off piece of meat. Huzzah.Truth be told, the script is hit-and-miss, but misses often enough where it eventually loses a discriminating viewer, and you're just left assimilating a morally adrift manhunt blood sport sequence.And if that floats yr boat, fine. But if you appreciate narrative integrity, skip it.",Revenge

39,kjproulx,A Crazy Ride From Start To Finish,9,17 May 2018,"Independent cinema can easily go under the radar to those who aren't all that invested in the film world, but also due to the fact that the film itself may be slightly too gruesome or weird. Personally, I would use both of those two words to describe Revenge to someone who is a mainstream audience member, who really can't get into anything abstract. From being a political statement to just plain crazy, this is a film that holds nothing back in terms of its message and the overall goal of being a satisfying revenge-fuelled flick. Although saying this film isn't for everyone would be the understatement of the year, here's why I'd recommend Revenge to hardcore film fanatics, or those who are literally up for anything when it comes to watching movies.Revenge follows Jen after she has been raped and left for dead in the middle of the desert. The married man who she had chosen to sleep with runs off with his two accomplices after the event. Right off the bat, there will be some unbelievable scenarios that you have to let slide, due to how gruesome her fall was. Her death sequence is horribly graphic and would've killed anyone else in an instant, but she somehow survives and finds herself hunting down these men. As I mentioned, this can be quite the unrealistic film at times, but the plot of the film itself feels very real.Director Coralie Fargeat clearly wanted to make a statement that relates to today's day and age and wasn't willing to stop short of anything, but pure insanity. From visuals that left a lasting impact in my mind, to being genuinely shocked at how realistic everything was seeming throughout my entire viewing experience, I found myself almost wanting to throw up at times. No, that's not a detriment to the film itself, but rather a large compliment. It's not very often that I can feel this traumatized after watching a movie, while also feeling incredibly satisfied at the same time.Matilda Lutz stars as Jen, and her performance here is out of this world. She completely disappears into this role, going from a very obviously stereotypical woman who sleeps with rich men, to the absolutely ruthless revenge-fuelled person who will stop at nothing to bring these men down. I was incredibly immersed in her mindset and found myself helping her along in my mind as the film progressed.The way long takes and editing styles are utilized in order to further the story in either an interesting or even twisted way was breathtaking to me. Abstract imagery or takes that would bore the average moviegoer are usually left out of mainstream entertainment in order to please everyone, but movies like this deserve to be seen by more people. Personally, even though it may be very hard to watch at times, this is easily one of my favorite films of the year so far.In the end, Revenge blends the very obvious tropes that a revenge flick presents, with a nice mixture of abstract, violent, and downright unnerving. From visuals that will make the squeamish tune out immediately to the overall look of the film being off-putting to those who wish to watch a generic thriller, all I can say is that if you know this type of movie isn't for you, then please stay far away from it. If you're looking for a nice spin on the genre, with terrific performances and one hell of a third act, then strap in, because I can't recommend this one enough. Revenge is a crazy thriller that is as relentless, entertaining, and sometimes impossible to sit through but wrapped up in a perfect little bow.",Revenge

In some aspects director Coralie Fargeat has created a film that is unique in the rape/revenge genre.
There's some wonderful artistic shots and cinematography here.
The use of sound is cleverly used but for me I think I missed the point. I didn't hate this movie but I just couldn't get on with it.
Disbelief is meant to be suspended to enjoy this ultra violent romp.
Whilst I did enjoy some. I personally was unable to look passed many elements I believe to be flaws. Let me explain.
For the most part this film is an illogical far fetched mess.
I don't mind a movie that pushes the realms of reality. As long as that's what the filmmaker and the storytelling intends.
If I'm watching Spider-Man or Star Wars then it's a given that they're going to be a little unbelievable but a film based in reality such as this?
If Revenge is trying to be a realistic horror thriller then it is littered with inconsistencies and unrealities.
I am missing the point aren't I?Jen played by Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz is the mistress of a wealthy man.
He invites her along to his annual hunting getaway with two of his buddies.
Jen soon catches the eye of the two men and is raped. When she escapes into the desert and is left for dead this movie becomes a fight for survival and revenge.If only this movie could have remained grounded this could have been a more njoyable experience.
Instead this film in most parts is down right stupid.
After Jen is pushed off a cliff and impaled on a tree she miraculously survives and proceeds to run around the scorching desert half naked, bare foot and with a tree branch protruding from her abdomen.
I did warn you that this film is ludicrous!
There's a scene where she performs first aid on herself whilst under the influence of a strong hallucinogenic.
Removing the tree branch from her stomach and then cauterising the wound.
If you thought the scene from Rambo III where Rambo cauterises his own wound with gunpowder was far fetched then just wait until you see this!
Further more she only treats the front of the wound and not the hole in her back.
I couldn't believe how far removed from reality this film is.
Ok I know it's fiction but come on!
Jen then goes from scared pretty little thing to a cross between Rambo and Laura Croft.
She's more than accomplished with a shotgun. In fact she could teach John Wick a thing or two. Her proficiency is never explained.
Jen then spends a few days running around in the sun with no means of hydration other than a can of warm beer.
Her serious wounds seem to heal faster than Wolverine and she never suffers sunburn or blistered feet.Characters make stupid decisions at every turn.
Wait for the scene where the rapist takes his boot off so he can use his sock to tend to a gunshot wound.
Why? Why wouldn't you put your boot back on?
Instead he decides to hobble around the desert with one boot!
""Idiot!!!""The climatic scene is equally dumb as the remaining bad guy gets shot in the gut. Let's just say if you had lost that much blood you would not be running around the house naked with shotgun.
There was so much blood the living room looked to have been redecorated.
I could go on but let me just say that this film could and should have been epic.
It had flashes of brilliance with all the right ingredients.
Good acting, good direction. Some thoughtful dialogue.

51,asifahsankhan,"This is a promising debut feature from Fargeat, with some impressive, gory practical effects and Robrecht",7,5 June 2018,"The rape-revenge sub-genre has many entries, and everything about ""Revenge"" (including the title) sounds derivative until you get to the credits. How many movies on this topic were written and directed by women? This one, a cool, synth-scored empowerment anthem from French first-timer Coralie Fargeat, turns the exploitation model on its head by delivering more male nudity than female, by not showing the rape graphically, and by making the rapist a pitiful coward, all without skimping on the blood, pain, and satisfying kickassery that the audience for a rape-revenge thriller came to see.Italian beauty Matilda Lutz stars as Jen, mistress to douchey business-stud Richard (Kevin Janssens), who has brought her to his isolated desert home for a rendezvous before his hunting buddies show up. Fargeat initially lets us think Jen is a subservient sex object (her first act upon reaching the house is to cheerfully offer Richard a BJ), but we learn otherwise when the hunting buddies - coldly sniveling Stan (Vincent Colombe) and sloppy Dimitri (Guillaume Bouchede) - arrive a day early. While drinking and partying, Jen dances lustily for the men, enjoying the full expression of her sexuality, the camera acknowledging her sexiness without leering at her. But Stan, entitled and insecure, takes Jen's performance personally and, the next day, assaults her while Richard is out of the house and Dimitri does nothing except turn up the TV to drown out Jen's screams.Jen subsequently suffers a grievous bodily injury (this we're shown graphically) that leaves the men thinking she's no longer a problem as they embark on their hunting trip. The men, you may rest assured, are incorrect. Jen proves to be a resilient survivor, the hunters become the hunted, etc. The heinous things that happen to the men thereafter are no worse than they deserve. Lutz isn't much of an actress, and the bulk of the dialogue being in English (a foreign language for everyone in the cast) gives the movie a faint whiff of Euro-cheese. But Fargeat deftly sets up the men as pathetic pigs and lets us revel in Jen's righteous triumph over them in a stylish, exhilarating fashion.",Revenge

53,bastos,Literally unbelieavable but brutal,7,12 March 2021,"This is undoubtedly a very divisive movie. It asks a lot from the viewer without a terribly rewarding payoff. It is the definition of style over substance. It is incredibly violent. And yet I also found it very entertaining. The rape revenge movie has been done to death and there is very little to add to this very specific genre. Here, Coralie Fargeat, takes the exploitative roots of this genre and embraces it unashamedly. It is incredibly well shot inputting a very personal style that I absolutely loved. Now, the elephant in the room, it is also incredibly unbelievable, and it does ask for a lot of suspension of disbelief making the rational side of my brain squirm in tears but in this occasion the emotional side won and I stayed for the ride. I can't overstate enough how much this movie could've gone either way in my evaluation, it really depends on the mood you see it, but for me, that day, it worked.

However, shortly after they arrive, Richard's friends, Stan (Vincent Colombe), Dimitri (Guillaume Bouchède), and Roberto (Jean-Louis Tribes) show up unannounced, urging Richard to join them on a hunting trip. As tension mounts in the house, Stan rapes Jen, but when she says she is going to go to the police, and to alert Richard's wife of his affair, the men attack her and leave her for dead. However, unbeknownst to them, she survives the assault, and has set out on revenge.Very much in the vein of films such as Straw Dogs (1971) and Day of the Woman (1978), Revenge is an insanely gory rape-revenge thriller. In her feature debut, writer/director Coralie Fargeat displays an astonishing visual panache as she re-appropriates this exploitative sub-genre for the post #MeToo era. From the expansive John Ford-esque vistas of the desert to the claustrophobic and labyrinthine finale, her visual language is as dexterous and thematically justified as one would expect from a master stylist such as Michael Mann. The film is very much about the dangers and darker implications of the male gaze, and the way Fargeat's constantly moving camera lingers on Lutz's half-naked body is deeply unsettling, challenging the audience to look at her in the same way the male characters do, before turning this notion on its head in the second half of the film. If you can ignore the plot contrivances, and stomach the gore, you will find a socially relevant film that is as auspicious a debut as you're likely to see all year.",Revenge

I fast-forwarded from the middle of the movie to the end. It was a pain to get through.
Seriously, there could have been thought just a bit more about details of the script (and pay more attention on what they're filming) and it could have been something much better.
From the moment the girl wakes up and ""escapes"" (which is unnecessarily ridiculous) everything is just stupid after stupid in terms of what and how things happen.
It's not even justified like if the violent scenes were filling, they're the whole thing in this movie, so if it's not done right, there's nothing else to see.

There are only 5 actors in this well put together thriller. One is a handsome guy that one reviewer said is naked in the film for the last 40 minutes and a couple talked about penises flailing about and naked cyborg guy and Vampire woman. Really odd takeaways from all. For the record maybe 5 seconds of penis and 3 minutes naked male butt.

69,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,9,27 November 2017,"While exploitation revenge flicks are common since its birth with I Spit on your Grave, Naked Vengeance and Savage Streets, this latest offering from up and coming French director gives us not only the same concept of rape revenge but manages to bring in a style that moves the film at a perfect pace and leveling up the brutality, gore and even giving us a feministic heroine to root for modern day film goers.The setup goes as this; a group of wealthy men and a woman party it up at an isolated villa in the middle of an outback desert. When the woman of the group gets violated by one of the group and wants out of the party, her lover (though a married man) pushes her off a cliff to her death, but they fail to see her dead as she survives and hunts down the three in a brutal fight for 'revenge'.With the plot description given, the film overall has the same old cliché's but what makes Revenge unique is it's style and tone that's thankfully done perfect with its cinematography and camera work. There are moments of surreal imagery, graphic wounds and bloody kills uncovered on screen and shades of The Revenant as the heroine finds herself, recovers and arms up to fight as much as Leo DiCaprio did in that film.The acting range holds firmly, while there's no chance of Oscar winners here in the cast, its heroine and villains move the story with each having a soul purpose to the story and justifying with the audience on what they did and who was the worst of the bad. The soundtrack composed by an music artist known as Rob is a sound for the ears and makes the film so stylish in sound as much as we see on screen.Overall, this is not something that will be forgotten overnight as Revenge is a brutal ride of violence, blood and survival. Though the cliché has been done again and again, it is given something new here and has earned my viewing pleasure and respect.4.5/5 - Nick Having heard so many great things about this movie I decided to check it out. The results are now in and it is true...it Is a great movie! You can't take your eyes off the screen, it's so visually stunning that you can't help but to admire the beautiful art done here! The director of this sick, twisted revenge flick (who's a female) does a great job considering the fact this is her first film. She has already proved herself to be extremely talented. The acting was good by everyone involved. The three main male villains were all equally evil in their own way. The victims boyfriend was definitely the leader and the main cause of all of this! This film is very similar to ""I spit on your grave"", but that doesn't mean it's not a good film. It's a very hard film to watch, but it's also very difficult to ignore! It's a great movie with a message that females are really strong people and can do just as much damage as men. See it in theaters. It's well worth your time! Lots of blood as well!

The first movie is your typical psychodelic goreporn revenge flick and the other movie it's trying to be is a serious ""deadliest game"" thiller.It fails at being the first because they don't take it all the way and give you the laugh out loud evil dead 2 blood coming out of the walls moments. Instead it's just unfunny unrealistic gore moments. It fails as a thiller because all of the characters are bland and uninteresting. Not only that but the characters personalities change on a dime. The protagonist for instance goes from being a helpless deer to a Navy Seal in one scene. It never feels but like she struggles. She just switches gears. The same could be said of the antagonists. Her boyfriend switches from protector to villain to sociopath murder machine in the span of 5 minutes in the film. The other two villains are just backround scenery. There's no build up or logic to it all. The funny thing is at first its not really made clear why they're at the house. I thought they were mercenaries which would explain the night and day attitude switches, but then it turns out these are supposed to be normal if wealthy joes going on a yearly hunt?

My feeling this was the genre or ""lens"" the filmmakers were going for, for example in the film, ""Last House on the Left."" It's not PC, and the straight young men will salivate and have wet dreams later on, but it is interesting as a backward glance. Maybe the question is should these kinds of movies be made anymore at all? We don't make extremely racist cartoons anymore (check out Bugs Bunny from the 40's, it's unreal). Is it time for the rape/revenge/porn movie to come to a close? I hope not, at least when the brutality of violence against women is not glorified, but shown for what it is: cruel, revolting and evil. It gets us to point where we cheer for the revenger. I can't understand how so many people hated this film, giving it one or two stars. The acting, script, editing and cinematography is excellent. It got something like 86% positive on Rotten Tomatoes. It's an awesome film, if you like revenge films, right up there with The Horseman (the Australian film, not the Dennis Quaid one).

Of course, but we need an essential element, the personality and ""Revenge"" tells a story seen countless times without doing so with a clear, strong and incisive personality that can allow it to stand out from the crowd, despite trying in all ways to take it out of a rather discreet direction that likes to experiment even if with little conviction, and from a color correction with bright and well-defined colors, unfortunately a certain thickness is lacking in all this.
So it ends up not telling anything new in a way that is too canonical and with an all too predictable and banal structure, besides it lacks a sense of credibility, caused by a series of inconsistencies, this causes the film to be too thin and, on this plan, immature.
Everything is then transported by a dense rhythm that prevents the film from being fluid and engaging, bringing it to moments of stalemate that affect the vision boring the viewer.

This film is fun ride in exploitation. Take your feminism triggers elsewhere...it was directed by a woman and as violent as it is, she is doing what many 80's slasher films set the table for. Some reviewers actually can't settle down enough to realize it's an anti-rape film, a spin on anti-misogynistic themes, after a pretty vile table setting in the first act.Some came for plots, writing and realism...IT'S AN EXPLOITATION HORROR FILM FOR CHRISTS SAKES. While it's exploiting, some of these folks forgot about checking their brains at the door and just watching. It ends up taking a turn that is more than satisfactory. Violence begets violence. There is no pretense that gives one a idea that this wouldn't be violent, much like I Spit on Your Grave (1978) was before it. Jen somehow manages to outbadass the original ""Jen"" from the aforementioned 70's slasher/exploitation classic.The cinematography and tense score are nothing short of brilliant in developing the film and the gore is nothing short of classic upgraded b-movie classic...Minimalistic but somehow doesn't feel like it.

How she survives what's done to her I find it hard to imagine. Nor can I readily credit the stamina she displays in going about her gory tasks, given how much blood she loses. Having said that, lay logic aside for an hour or so and you'll be rewarded with a fairly gripping thriller. It has a low-budget pulp shocker feel to it throughout, but somehow it feels right for the style of the film. There's a satisfying conclusion, preceded by a superbly tense scene involving a blood-soaked chase with guns round part of the house.
Matilda Lutz looks the part as the heroin in distress, and her rich but utterly self-interested lover is well portrayed, but I wasn't so keen on the hunting buddies. Sleazy, yes, and unquestionably up to the task of instigating the trouble, but I just can't see why the three of them would be friends. The script is probably the weakest part of the film, but it's shortcomings are largely pushed into the background by the visuals.
To conclude, if you like an action-filled gore-fest with some unlikely survival skills and death to all those who deserve it, this is the film for you.",Revenge

92,Lugo1989,Definitely needs to be taken with a pinch of salt,6,12 June 2018,"There is an insane amount of exaggeration in Revenge in many aspects of the film. If you treat it like a story taken from a comic book or a video game you might enjoy it. I am not sure if the filmmakers wanted for people to treat it like that or not but it is hard to interpret it otherwise. The direction, acting and photography are all top-notch and the female and male leading actors are pure eye candy material. It is nice to see a lead female character that is strong and tough. This does not make a film a feminist propaganda like some argue since the gorgeous leading lady is never wearing much in the film and there are numerous close-ups of her behind. It is a bloody, sexy, violent thrill ride if you allow it to be but as mentioned before, take it with a pinch of salt - maybe more than a pinch. Give it a shot and see what you make of it.",Revenge

96,Eiriksterminator,Pretty decent,7,10 March 2018,"This movie is a pretty decent revenge thriller, but unlike The Revenant, which keeps things within the realm of realism, this movie is ruined a bit by how unrealistic it is sometimes. With the amount of blood some of these characters lose, they should be dead several times over. The average male has around 5 litres of blood in his boody, and the average female has 3 litres. Some of these characters lose a whole lot more than that...Couple this with no food or water for a long time (to allow the body to replenish the blood loss) for one of these characters, in a scorching desert no less, and yeah, it's not very realistic...Especially considering the character in question is running around at high speed in this climate the day after these events unfold, without much difficulty. The matter of having a huge wound with a large object stuck in it for a whole day and not getting an infection despite getting said wound dirty, is another problem, though I suppose that one's possible. One character also somehow catches up to a still driving car on foot, despite initially being faaar behind said car...Anyway, basically, the movie would have been much better if it devoted a bit more time to the actual survival aspect as well, and not just the revenge part, and if it was a bit more realistic. This is the main issue with the movie though imo. Other than that it's fine.P.S: I just have to say it, good god, the main actress in this is absolutely gorgeous. Which of course is the point, but yeah, good casting.",Revenge

100,FabledGentleman,What is with the high metascore? Makes no sense.,4,25 June 2018,"This movie. Is a very uneven mess.At times this movie felt like a John Carpenter movie, just without the suspense Carpenter is famous for. But it uses similar soundtrack and similar storytelling and camera techniques that he uses in many of his films.If this movie had been a satire on his work, it could have been pretty good. But this movie isn't. It's a movie that don't really know what it wants, is it a satire? At times it feels like it, but then it feels completely serious, then it feels like a satire again, and then we are back at serious.Not only is it very uneven, the movie makes about as little sense as eating carrots on pizza. I can only conclude that the only reason this movie scores so high among critics, is that it's about revenge after a rape. And in these times with #metoo it's important to stand with the girls. There is one critic that gave this movie 100/100... meaning perfect, a brilliant masterpiece, ""apocalypse now"" level of movie. Are you friggin kidding me?There is something twisted and wrong with this world man, where even professional critics can't contain their biased feelings, and let it influence their view. Now those critics will respond that scoring movies is a lot about feelings. Yes it is, but then again, try and think for a second if you are manipulating yourself. This movie is NOT a 10/10, Jesus.But let that be said, this movie isn't awful either. It has lots of style, some good suspense at times, some really nice cinematography at times, and a very pretty girl with one seriously inviting butt. And she can actually act a little bit too, so not all bad.But there are too many scenes that makes absolutely no sense, it just feels like dumb decisions have been made to cut cost, or to just simply make it easier on themselves to actually shoot this film. Most of this film just happens in a desert with just a few people in the cast, there i little to no effort making this movie. The gore effects are ""copy paste"", same make-up every time, same everything. The good moments are few and far apart, and also the way she get's her revenge is very unsatisfying, but then again the rape scene was so poorly orchestrated i hardly felt anything. It's just a very uneven movie, that falls short of mediocre, it comes dangerously close to being a bad film. But it's saved by those moments where the tension actually works, that's all this movie has going for it.But then again, if the tension is what works, this can't have been intended as a satire? Because those completely over the top scenes are not funny or entertaining, they just suck, they are simply put, just over the top. For the sake of being over the top.So a movie neither a good thriller, or a good satire.4/10 - Poor",Revenge

102,pedroquintaoo,The Kill Bill of this year,9,16 June 2018,"When I saw the trailer about Revenge, I thought was going to be another stereotyped horror movie about a girl being raped and then killing them all. Revenge is kinda that but so much better and different of any film from that sub-genre.
We saw a girl trying to kill who tried to put an her life, but the story is helped by an awesome director, a great cinematography, sound mixing and good editing. I won't spoil what happens during the story, I just wanna say you will be surprised, looks like if Quentin Tarantino decided to do a horror movie with the help of a good cinematographer to give some great and wonderful images.The only problem for me was the lack of coherence, this is not a spoiler, everybody knows the men tried to kill her, but in the scene where she was going to be killed, she was kind off a Super-Woman and she survived to a thing impossible to survive. I would change it, but what comes next is really good to make you forget that small mistake. I also would deepen the main character at the beginning because she was a little bidimensional, we didn't know if she was interested in one of the guys or if she was just drunk.For me is one of the best movies of the year, a good thriller with violent scenes and one of the best endings I've seen (I don't have words to describe how amazing are the last 10-15 minutes).Rating: 9/10",Revenge

105,jgkelley-48797,Has any1 seen the commercial,5,31 January 2021,"Has any1 seen the commercial where it goes something like this...the girl goes, ""why don't we just go to the running car"", & the boy replies, ""what are you crazy, let's hide behind the chainsaws"".Now most people lol. But u have those small % of other peeps. Prob something like 2/100 peeps who just think they so much smarter than every1 else & state the obv & say, ""durrr, that would never happen"". Like the other 98 peeps don't understand it would never happen. Yet they completely understand it's a COMMERICAL 😂No dif with movies. We often see reviews where a minority of reviewers will leave a lazy review with a 1 score & 1 of the reasons is that it's unRealsitic or they say, ""ya like that could or would really happen"". It's like they don't understand it's a movie. Basically, anything can happen. Now I'm not gonna lie, I usually prefer, a movie that it realistic throughout, but it doesn't mean I can't enjoy a movie where something occurs that's a little silly or unrealistic. As for this movie, I mean without spoiling anything, what are their 2 scenes where it's like that? So what? My God, it's literally ova an hour the rest of the way where stuffs totally plausible. The 2% who seem to be unable to wrap head around fact that it's a MOVIE are usually those responsible for 1-2 ratings on movies we have all seen an enjoyed yet cant figure out for the life of us how some1 could give such a low rating. We ask ourselves, ""hmm, trolls?"" And yes, many times they are. But I feel like some others really don't get it. They think they just so intellectual that they wanna share with us how smart they are.So take a movie like ""revenge"". We see people complain about gore. Well the movie is called, ""Revenge"". I mean cmon. It's like some1 watching a horror movie & complaining bout monsters or killing. I never for the life of understand people who hate a certain type of movie, yet they watch it then jump on to write a bad review. It's like one of us ordering food at a restaurant & ordering something we know we won't like. Then racing online to write a bad review review so we can complain about the meal & the establishment.This movie is called, 'Revenge', and so I would hope u would understand what you are getting in for when watching it. If you've liked other revenge type movies like Mandy, I spit on you're grave, or some good 80s horror/revenge movies like terror train, graduation day, redeemer:son of satan then I'm sure u will at least find this movie passable. By passable I mean watchable & at least somewhat enjoyable. I only give it a 5 cuz I found it pretty average. Which is by no means bad. I've seen enough movies to know when something is bad. I mean I've turned hundred off after a half hour or sooner. We all have different tastes, I'm not demanding everyone give the same rating. We all can have our opinions. But for the love of God, these people with their 1's need to stop. Especially when I see them on movies like a simple favor, the recruit, King Arthur, the movie wolves with Jason momoa which was awesome for a werewolf movie btw. Another thing, I bring up wolves specifically cuz when I watch that movie & rate it, I am comparing to other movies of that genre, and to other werewolf movies. I'm not gonna compare it to citizen Kane, Maltese falcon, the big sleep, casa Blanca, north by northwest, charade, Chinatown or to all the other Hollywood classics ova the yrs. that's just asinine. Now u can say, who am I to tell peeps how to rate. But if u would be 1 to say that, you're clearly that minority who think it's cool to hand 1's out on movies everyone else knows was anything but. For a revenge/horror movie IMO this movie isn't missing much. It's just pretty straight forward & nothing great. So that's only reason why I'm not gonna give it high rating.I just can't be the only 1 tired of this siskel & Ebert wannabe cult who think cuz they've seen a movie similar they gonna give it a 1. The ""been there, seen that"" crowd. Jokes on them I Guess cuz thousands of movies are pumped out every yr if not more & movies have been around for 100+yrs. I'm sry but we've seen everything by now. So get used to seeing retreads & ""rip-offs"" like some of y'all like to call em. Life isn't that complicated. There's only so much one can do with a life. So this idea that you're seeing something knew, guess what, you're not. It's like the old disclaimer from some movie, ""the story is the same, only the names have changed"". Another excuse for 1 of these horribly low reviews we see on a good movie is cuz someone will pick out plot holes. It's like they need everything single thing covered & a backstory on every character from their childhood to their current age & they also need everything explained thoroughly & wrapped in bow. I admit, there are times where something will be left out that kinda ruins the movie. But this is so very rare & usually when I see the plot hole complaint, it's about little trivial things that it's almost like my god give us a break. So we have the ""that would never happen"" crowd, the ""that movie was so unoriginal"" bunch, the ""my god, how many plot holes can we fit in 1 movie"", and last but not least, the lets complain about it how offensive it was. These are the worst. I read a review from an actual website where a critic actually dissected lucky number Slevin so bad I thought they had completely gone off the deep end. They started talking about how insensitive it was towards gay community cuz of Vals character. They complained cuz they felt the movie didn't need the sex scenes. I can't stand any1 who complains about a sex scene. Unless these people have never been with another man or woman then I don't wanna hear it. What they can do anything in their lives but god forbid they put it into a MOVIE! For the love of God. There was more to as I said this person actually dissected it & im not gonna give away ending but they complained why that backstory was even put into the movie. Maybe they should write their own movie if they gonna say this movie should've left half the scenes out. This isn't political either, I can't stand trump & am no way a conservative. I'm no longer a liberal either tho cuz I feel like the world has become hey pick a side & get extreme as possible. This isn't political no, it's common sense & being an adult. I'm sry, but 99% of the world population doesn't wanna watch the Mickey Mouse club 24/7. So some movies are gonna have a rape scene, it doesn't mean the screenwriter & director are promoting sexual violence. There's gonna be movies where a guy hits a woman. It doesn't mean it's promoting domestic violence. There might be a movie where a gay slur is hurled at someone. It doesn't mean the director or screen writer is homophobic or anti-gay. I saw a movie today & wanted to see what purpose of ending was. It was where 2 cops kinda did something & got a way with it. I read a 'professional review where reviewer was actually dumb enough to compare the movie to what's been going on in USA recently with a few bad cops here & there abusing their power. So this person actually went on to say how inappropriate it was for the movie to have an ending like that & called it tone-death. Mind after this person admitted that the screenplay was written in the 1990s. Before all this stuff came to forefront-mainly due to cellphone cams, social media, online forums & wider news coverage. But they are also quick to point out how the issue has been going on for hundreds of yrs. I mean for the love of god mate, it was a F'n movie. Seriously, Wtf are we doing? Enough with ""that's kinda offensive"" ""that movie didn't even need that scene in it"". Or seeing a naked girl in shower, getting dressed or even having sex with a someone & complaining cuz u felt it did nothing for the movie. Your a clown if u think any of those scenarios is degrading. So sex is degrading? A woman taking a shower is degrading? A woman getting dressed is degrading now? Like I said, wtf are we doing? Wait, you can do far more in your own bedrooms, but forbid it someone in a movie takes their top off 😂. So degrading, that poor actress. She must've been forced to do that scene. No wholesome woman would ever do that on her own accord & willingly do that. She must've been threatened to do that horribly degrading scene. I really can not for the life me ever understand these people. Seems to be cult growing who thinking this way. Everything's offensive. But much like is always the case, u get a peek behind their curtain & their doing far worst but they gonna complain about other people doing things that majority of us see nothing wrong with.",Revenge

We don't even read your reviews with a 1 cuz they are lazy & we know your opinion holds as much weight as air. Between them, or reading ""the worst movie ever"", as if ya we are gonna believe you that it's actually the ""worst movie ever"". Actually we know to rule out your thoughtless review right there.It seems the minority of people who don't like this movie complain for the following reasons. First, it's unrealistic. Getting real tired of the ""that would never happen"" cult who seem to not understand that it's a movie & anything can happen. It's like the commercial with the teenagers escaping a serial killer. The girl goes why don't we go for the running car before the boy says to her, ""are you crazy, let's hide behind the chainsaws"". While 99% of us lol & cuz we get its a COMMERCIAL. U have the 1%era who feel the need to tell us, durrr that would never happen. It's like they need to tell us how unrealistic that situation is and how it would never play out like that in real life. Ummm thx we get it. We don't care.Another reason for the hate for this movie seems to be the gore. The movie is called 'Revenge' & is a thriller/horror. Wtf are u expecting? Some people lol.Another reason seems to be the keeping up with the current climate in the world. It's like everyone pick a side & get extreme as possible. So much like in politics, everyone is divided cuz peeps go too far with things. You'll have the Uber PC who are against gore & exploitation. Then you have the far right folk who think things are taken too far with women empowerment. It's funny cuz they don't realize these extremists are actually agreeing on something for once. Just for dif reasons. Who wouldve thunk it would take a movie called 'Revenge' to bring the two extreme sides of of both aisles together. I'm not talking about the average person on either side either, I'm talking about the Pc crowd who are offended by everything and take things to far & the ultra conservative side who go above & beyond even that. These people not to long ago complained about the recent Star Wars films & claimed a women was ruining them because she put a woman in the lead & they were against the women empowering & all the ""PC"" angles. Now I'm not bringing my politics into this so don't get it twisted. I'm pointing out how other people have. I don't align with either side & instead use my brain to decide on issues & not whether I'm left or right & decide by side of the aisle I stand on. I think it's undeniable about what I've said tho & it's crazy people actually wonder why world so divided.Why can't people just take the movie for what it is. It's a revenge flick. Aka REVENGE MOVIE. Why would u even watch if you don't like these movies? And why come on & write a review after. It's like rest of us ordering a dinner at a restaurant & ordering something we know we don't like. Then after rushing online to write a review & say things like, ""worst dinner ever"". It makes very little sense to us why u certain folk do silly things like that. Seriously, googling how much blood does a human body hold? And that's a reason this movie is stupid. Cuz they used 3X the blood? Hahahaha. Like u even know what if it's 2x 3x or 10x. It wasn't hyperbole either, he specifically googled it and made calculutions. Talk about mind-blown.",Revenge

They are on a weekend vacation at his middle of nowhere outback home. There's some sex, and gratuitous butt shots until the arrival of the wealthy man's friends. After one of them sexually assaults the main character, she is pushed off a cliff and impaled on a tree. The men then try to hunt her as she slowly takes her revenge in some gruesome ways.

The actors also do their job in being gross sleazy monsters just begging for comeuppance. Yet, in the context of the genre, everything seemed so blase. Although I admit, the glass in the foot scene had me cringing like I haven't for a while, so kudos for that.Revenge is good. It's worth seeing if you like this kind of film.

This one was a very good surprise. The actress become without mercy after she fall and start to understand she is not anymore a little Lolita but a prey. And decide to survive killing them. 
The way she do that is very unusual for a Hollywood movie and have a lot of tastes because this is not super bimbo it is just smart, realistic and the way you can do it if you were in her shoes, hurt, lost in a desert with killers behind you.I do not agree about comments saying : 
Rambo Girl, that is nothing close to Rambo, look again Rambo and you will understand why ""no brains"" think that. It is a totally different story and context.For once when you watch this movie you will get bunch of emotions, it is crude, aggressive, you will be uncomfortable a lot of time even before the horror show start.

As most European movies are these days (Even Gaspar Noe's infamous 'Love' had only topless female nudity and just dicks in closeups,squirting,etc) ,it is a gay's christmas delight. 
The lead actor seems to have been picked solely for his fitness and readiness to go completely stark naked (for the last 40 minutes of the movie).Funnily,the other male actors look normal unlike the model-body,six-pack leading actor.The female nudity is limited to fleeting topless and one rear-nudity shot.This is so sexploitative that at times it is stunning and actually distracts the viewer from the movie.French are obsessed with the male genitals and here you have it all in its glory for such a lengthy time.Having said that it is an effective thrillers with the leading lady very good in the role.If swinging dicks disturb your senses,watch the movie after a drink!!",Revenge

And this movie was definitely no exception.French writers and directors try way too hard to make everything uneccesarily artsy and symbolic while ignoring actual story or trying to make sense, which is exactly what this director/writer did. (With the exception of Luc Besson) The trailer was stupid to give away the shock factor of the boyfriend being a bad guy. The Foley artist's over the top sound effects made for some interesting albeit silly scenes. The Ridiculousness of the girl's terminatoresque abilities made me think there was a supernatural factor and maybe this would be interesting after all, but we quickly learned the director/writer was just going for extremely unrealistic characters and situations. Every character in the movie would have died from the insane amounts of blood loss that was 100X the amount in any human body. I can appreciate the attempt at practical effects but instead of spending the extra money on hyper-saturated artsy fartsy scenery and high priced vehicles and leather outfits (perfect for desert adventures), they should have used that money on a proper SFX guy. The situations in the movie seemed to come from the mind of a third grader telling a fantastical story "" Yeah, and then she falls like 2,000 feet off the cliff and lands on a tree branch... and, and it goes right through her! But she doesn't break her back, and... and she's only a few feet off the ground so she can reach her lighter and catch the tree on fire! Yeah ummm and she uh doesn't get on fire but uh breaks off the branch and is like totally fine, even though it looks like she lost half her weight in blood. Yeah uh huh, she's like the terminator and walks through the desert without shoes, on all kinds of rocks without a problem and um then she miraculously uses fire to heal the giant hole through her body and looks totally normal except for maybe some black on her.

It's action-suspense done RIGHT, with plenty of surprises and reversals of fortune ... and a LOT of blood. It's in the finest French Grand Guignol tradition, alongside such films as LANCELOT OF THE LAKE, MARTYRS and HAUTE TENSION.Although transpiring in a decidedly more hospitable climate and over a much smaller area, the film has unmistakable similarities to THE REVENANT. Both feature a main character left for dead (in this case, the gorgeous Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz) who manages to self-recover through agonizingly painful procedures to embark on a payback quest. Her transformation from a philandering husband's sex kitten mistress to a semiautomatic-wielding vengeance machine (think Lolita to Furiosa) is most impressive.The film was written and directed by a woman, Coralie Fargeat, and she definitely makes a convincing case that women can play hardball as well as men can. Between this and Lone Scherfig's THE RIOT CLUB, I'm getting impressed with female directors' ability to make films that appeal to my demanding aesthetic.The plot is straightforward, but the execution is anything but paint-by-numbers.

Was this film going to be gore porn schlock à la video nasty of the 1980s? Was I going to have to use my popcorn box as a make-shift sick bucket? The audience in the foyer had been murmuring excitedly about this film, though....perhaps, contrary to my thoughts, it actually would be a well-conceived and methodic piece of work. The answer is: predominantly, yes it is.Revenge is a feminist horror/thriller film by relative French newcomer, Coralie Fargeat. Matilda Lutz plays a girl called Jen who is enjoying a getaway with her boyfriend at his luxury desert pad until their romantic plans are cut short by the unexpected arrival of his two male friends proposing a hunting trip. While the situation starts off as amicable between the three men and Jen, considering the abruptness of the change of plan, tensions start to mount in the house after certain drunken antics lead to misconstructions. The next morning, Jen is suddenly raped by one of the male friends while her boyfriend is absent. When the boyfriend returns, all three males become intolerant of her distressed pleas to call the helicopter so she can leave. With tension reaching peak-level, the boyfriend pushes Jen off a cliff, after which she is left in a gruesome state, which she miraculously survives. Beginning the process of self-medication, she moves stealthily through the desert, determined to exact her revenge on this misogynous assemblage.This film is perceptively shot, and the editing of the breathtaking showdown of the film is inspired. What's more, this film is accompanied by a great 80s-esque electronic soundtrack by ""Rob"" which sounds, at times, like a cross between Vangelis' score for Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and that of Wendy Carlos for Stanley Kubrick's 70s thriller, A Clockwork Orange. The actors are more than convincing in their roles, with Lutz showing enough resilience and raw emotion as the female action heroine to put Lara Croft in the dark. That said, I do not mean to trivialise the film. This is a movie with much black humour, but it is also wincingly shocking and serious. It's release could not be more timely in a society where women are belatedly getting rights they have so long fought for, and we are coming to terms with the horrible reality of rape and the controversial idea of the ""male gaze"" which cinema has so long engendered.This film flips stereotypes on their head, and so it should. This film needs to be seen. My only hope is that the film will not encourage the lesser-known idea of misandry against men collectively, in some circles.

Be warned, this film is shallow pulp. Coralie Fargeat demonstrates strong direction and makes a highly cinematic experience. Although I feel embarrassed for the actors, their performances are acceptable (Stan's performance is truly animalistic.) Finally, the first act has some great moments of dark humor and subverting the ""male gaze,"" but everything soon falls apart.""Revenge"" wallows in exploitation and becomes gratuitous, if not downright off-putting. It's hard to find empowerment in a film riddled with brutality because I'm scrambling to find characterization, depth, and insight when there is none. The film simply attacks a tired trope and leaves the characters to suffer each others endless cruelty.

Rather than linger on the act, it cuts away but still leaves us with the puzzle pieces for our minds to put together so we still invested and protective of our heroine. Other than that, however, the editing can get a bit pretentious in some areas. Despite the editing choices, it's the film's cinematography where director Coralie Fargeat truly shines. For a director's first full-length film, I'm truly impressed with how beautiful and striking the film looks. Not only does Matilda Lutz prove she's more than eye candy by earning every scene she's in, but she even steals scenes with just her character's sheer aura.

That said, I've seen a LOT of them, but I always fast forwarded through the rape scene. The revenge part is what interests me because I love seeing bad guys get what they deserve. I ended up seeing this one one night when a friend suggested watching it at her house. I had never heard of it. Thankfully it didn't dwell on the rape scene in graphic detail. So then I settled in to watch the revenge part. Only, it ended up being pretty... boring. Once the film ended, I just shrugged and said ""meh."" I was expecting more, especially from a female writer/director, which is the big promotional hook for the movie. Critics said it's ""refreshing to see a rape revenge film not hampered by the male gaze."" No clue what they meant by that. I've never seen a rape revenge film made by a man that glorified the rape sequence. They also didn't make the victims look as promiscuous or flirty as this one, so I don't know how they were ""hampered."" So I assumed that meant the director would really make a point of making the men suffer. Nope. They all died pretty unimaginably. Nothing you couldn't see on a network TV program, though obviously with a lot less fake blood and male nudity (from the front anyway). So if you're looking for a revenge film heavy on the revenge, skip this one. Find one made with a ""male gaze."" Apparently that means it's more entertaining.",Revenge
164,DeadeGuard98,"A Rape, A Cover-up and The Revenge.",9,4 June 2020,"😱 First Impressions:
It just goes to show that words do not always capture the scene- from the synopsis and reviews I read, it is basically 'I Spit on Your Grave' (which I have not watched). Instead of a movie capitalising on the sexual exploitation, rape and trauma of the female protagonist, it is instead about how that experience can evolve a victim.Pros:
😋 The cinematography and symbolism behind the film is on point. From the initial meeting between Jen and Richard's friends which is captured through an apple being consumed by an ant. Then with Jen's death and resurrection, even to the image of a Phoenix being burnt onto her skin! It's subtle yet it signifies a massive transformation within Jen's character.😋 Matilda's acting range is very broad~ She played the vivacious party girl in the beginning who is living the life of a mistress. But then grows increasingly scared when Stan misinterprets her flirtations as 'making a move' and near insane after being raped.😋 The whole story is just balls to the wall. It explores an all too well known matter of woman being around men. But it twists that through how the men eventually become the hunted instead despite being adept hunters themselves. The whole movie plays out like an actual hunt- except between humans. The only animal we see is a corpse shot by Richard in the midst of tracking Jen down or through the hallucinations when she ingests the hallucinogens.Cons:
😪 As amazing as the story was, a part of me just couldn't comprehend how Jen could've survived (though admittedly the word is barely). It's almost as if there was divine intervention because she seemed very dead and a certain spirit of revenge has possessed her. Perhaps that's why she no longer utters a word after being kicked off the cliff and this goes on until the credits roll... Makes you think doesn't it?😪 The films portrays men as scum and it brings the issue of ""women asking for it"" what with the manner of acting by Jen or how she dresses. Even Richard brings this up; about she's 'irresistible' when an inmensely upset Jen wants to go home. The film could have done so much more instead of giving (obviously what the audience wants) with the eye candy of actors playing Jen and Richard respectively. At least the film doesn't discriminate by only subjecting Jen to the male gaze~ OMG I'm blabbing....😇Verdict😈
To conclude, Revenge is an insanely tense and action packed delivering sought entertainment for close to 2 hours long. Though arguable not the first in the sub-genre of revenge rape; Last House on The Left, I Spit on Your Grave... it does enough to stand out from its peers in many things- setting, story and of course kills! Though I would have loved it more if the men were punished for their crimes because death is just an easy way out..",Revenge

166,LnineB,Doesn't carve any new paths,5,7 December 2020,"I don't know..... I just don't get the appeal. The constant abandoning of character development in stories like this bothers me. What makes a guy so damn evil that they decide to kill a girl he dated, just to keep her from telling on a friend that he didn't like in the first place? What makes a girl who doesn't have a history of showing no strength at all, all of the sudden show the strength to survive a bloody death but also get Terminator like revenge????In it's defense, the rape revenge trope is know for it's shallow story telling, even the most revered ( Last House, I Spit, etc.) seem hell bent on not having any character development at all. But the biggest problem I have is why are we still getting these types of films in 2020? Especially following some of the films that in my opinion flipped the script on the genre like, Irreversible and Red White and Blue.Both of those films proved that you don't need a complicated plot in order to give the character some depth. They prove that it can be done is many ways through the tools that movie making grants a director. Where Last House and I spit on your grave is given the license to ignore those tools due to their low budget and grindhouse era, this film should not get the same pass.Because of the lack of character development, I really didn't care what happened to any of the characters. And although the action scenes were well choreographed, I spent more time questioning the how and why instead of enjoying the thrill ride. I've seen reviews that say this is the new revenge film for the METOO era but to me I just watched a poor knock-off of I spit on your grave that doesn't address a single modern issue related to the era.

171,SenorLengua,"Fun, but lots of suspension of disbelief (spoiler part noted)",5,13 July 2019,"When reading the review, I will critique the movie will be mostly based on the trailer, except for the bit near the end ...Based on the trailer, I was expecting this movie to be in English. It was not, mostly. A but of a surprise at the start, but did not detract. Yet did make it a bit weird in terms of plots/characters.So it is clear that we have a wealthy individual and his lover going to some house in the dessert. As someone who has lived in that part of the US...um. what? A house like that waaaay out there? And I mean waaaaay out there. No, not really.And then these two guys show up. In the middle of the desert. At this house. When the lover is there. Really?! Okay, we know the purpose is to set up the rape scene, and based on the trailer, this is presumably moment all hell starts to break lose. Not quite, but more or less, that is the case.The then Matilda Lutz is pushed off a clif onto a spike which in any Bond movie would have killed the villain. But this is where suspension of disbelief really begins. We know she survives. We know she heals herself, and we know she becomes this barefoot badass.Now, please, when watching the trailer I assumed there would be some explanation for ability to ""hunt."" But there could be no explanation for being barefoot in the dessert. And what the hell was that about her somehow getting off that tree? Yeah, just a bit too much.Getting away from the trailer, the movie was rather fun. Great visuals, use of color and the vastness of the dessert. And while the movie is not greatly acted or written, there are moments and scenes which are great.{spoiler, sort of}
The one part which I disliked the most was the ending. All that blood and chasing around was stupid and one dimensional (even for those characters) and ended, well, without satisfaction. Perhaps that was intended, and that revenge in real life is not really satisfying. But there was so much suspension of disbelief, that it needed to carry on. The movie really should have let us have that feel-good moment rather than how it actually ended.

185,LongLiveTheNewFlesh27,"A-lot of talent on display, needed some fine-tuning",7,16 May 2018,"The plot of Revenge is nothing new. Somebody has something horrible done to them, they somehow recover alive from that incident and they come back to wreak havoc on their assailants. The presentation of it is what sets it apart from something like I Spit on Your Grave. It's lavishly shot, with the bright desert landscape the perfect canvas to throw buckets and buckets of blood and gore on.In the beginning, the camera focuses on backsides, pretty faces and lavish scenery (you can see a winking parody of Michael Bay's style in this film), until it begins to focus on mangled bodies, cuts oozing blood and some of the most absurd blood loss I've ever seen on film. Yes, this film is very unrealistic, and that's not necessarily my problem. My problem is that the main character (no spoilers) by the end, seems basically invincible. Yes, she hobbles and breathes rapidly to show that she isn't, but with so much blood spilled, is there anything that she can't get out of? To me, that just kind of deflated the tension. If it had been a twee little bit more grounded I think it would have functioned much better.All and all, I can recommend this film. It has a feminist message without being condescending or hamfisted. As a genre-piece, it operates somewhere between Kill Bill, Wolf Creek and I Spit on Your Grave, and if you can get down with that, as I can, then I'd recommend this film. Side note: The way the director handles space is actually really well done. There is a scene where two characters chase each other around and it evolves so that we see that they are moving in circles. She's good at repetition to enhance narrative.",Revenge

Nope. Perhaps our heroine goes about dispatching these nasty guys in really creative ways. Nope. Maybe it will be a very realistic take on the genre. HELL NO. The setup for the antagonists is ham-fisted and clumsy and our lead is not overly smart or capable, which means she should have just died. She's barefoot in the wilderness and doesn't even think to take a dead man's shoes, or his belt or his coat.If you're weak and stupid, why should I root for you at all? Because you're beautiful?

I love revenge films. I'm not crazy about rape in films because it really upsets me but I understand it as a plot device. I'm able to suspend my disbelief in the service of an interesting film but when a 105lb woman is impaled through the abdomen by a tree branch, ""seals"" the wound with a red-hot beer can and then is running around barefoot in the desert with barely a scar to show for it.... it's pushing the limits even if the film were grossly entertaining, which it isn't.If not for the practical gore effects and stunning camera work, this would be a total snore-fest.

When the cauterizes the wound, the image from the beer can she uses is transferred to her body, with the writing ""raised"" on her skin. This is not possible.During the final ""battle"", the male lead loses more blood than the human body contains, yet he is still able to chase her around the house without getting dizzy or passing out.Again, for a movie that is supposed to take place in the ""real"" world, I found these things to be completely ridiculous.",Revenge
202,Stars-and-popcorn,Can You Guess What 'Revenge' is About?,8,24 April 2018,"Personally, I think no one does revenge like the Koreans. However, the French certainly gave it one hell of a shot with this dark and twisted film called, well, 'Revenge.' There are a lot of things that this movie manages to get right, but it feels like a tale that's been told one too many times and doesn't feel like it brings enough originality to make it really stand out. Still, as blood-soaked horror movies go, 'Revenge' is a pretty damn good one.Director Coralie Fargeat brings us a brutal film about a woman's struggle to survive against three predatory men. At the center of the story is Matilda Lutz as Jen, a seemingly professional mistress working for a wealthy Frenchman taking a holiday with some of his buddies. From the beginning, it's clear that Jen is nothing more than an object to her disgusting male counterparts (Vincent Colombe, Guillaume Bouchède, and Kevin Janssens), something that she doesn't object to at first, but things slowly start to go too far. When Jen finally stands her ground against one of the hairy upright pigs they do what any typical misogynist would do and leave her for dead in the desert. The problem is that leaving people for dead in movies often comes back to bite you on the ass...Ever since 'Kill Bill,' there's been an obsession with drenching beautiful women in blood and battering them to make them seem strong and powerful on the big screen. It's certainly worked for a few films like 'The Descent,' 'You're Next,' and 'Atomic Blonde,' and to a certain extent it works for 'Revenge.' However, it seems excessive, almost gratuitous at certain parts. It's understandable that Jen is meant to be a force of nature turning back on those who wronged her, but at a certain point, blood loss becomes a serious concern. There are even rumors are that the production crew used so much fake blood that they would often run out of it on set. Needless to say, Revenge is definitely a gory, revenge-driven horror film that ensures the heroes victims suffer much more than she does. I have to give some serious credit to Matilda Lutz who turns in a jaw-dropping performance. She sells the idea that she has an indomitable spirit with every fiber of her being, which is a complete 180 from how she starts the film out. The sequences where she performance field surgery on herself in order to survive will make audiences absolutely cringe even though it doesn't show anything too disturbing. Instead, Coralie Fargeat relies on Lutz's reactions, screams, and wails of pain to really sell the sequences. This only makes it all the more convincing as she pursues her attackers across a desolate desert landscape. 'Revenge' is very much a movie about survival. On both sides of this fight are people doing everything they possibly can to save their lives. While Jen's life is quite literally on the line, the attackers are metaphorically dead if she does make it out alive. After all, they do attempt to rape her and murder her while on vacation. Of course, it's easy to pick a side in this fight from the get-go, but the fact that this is a down and dirty fight for survival makes it all the more enthralling to watch it unfold. Especially since Jen has an almost supernatural drive to finish what they started. In that regards, 'Revenge' is about as hardcore and brutal as they come.It's always been such a disturbing notion to me that men with power feel the need for even more power. It's as though their entitled to it. 'Revenge' makes this very clear by the fact that these incredibly wealthy scumbags, who can buy anything they want, feel the need to assert even more power over Jen. In a way, she's there because they are men with power, but these men turn out to be psychopaths in the making with a need to control everything around them. When they can't, things go wrong very quickly for everyone. With that in mind, I have to warn audiences that these men are gut-wrenching to watch. As bloody and gruesome as 'Revenge' is, it's the men who are the most revolting part of the entire movie.Honestly, I think 'Revenge' is very much the new 'High Tension' and I can not wait to see what Coralie Fargeat. It's a tremendous film with a strong woman at the center of it that will shock everyone with how powerful her will to survive is. Personally, I would have rolled over and died in the first ten minutes of what she endures. While it does take things a little too far at times, it never really feels like it's done for shock value. It's definitely not for the faint of heart though and if you're sensitive to scenes of violence against women then you will not want to see this. Horror fans and people who want to see some disgusting men get what they deserve though will love 'Revenge.'",Revenge

A young woman and her boyfriend who's already married arrive at a secluded luxurious house in a helicopter in the middle of a desert. The helicopter leaves them behind for a few days to enjoy each other's company. The second day of enjoying this luxurious house two strange men arrive who are supposedly the boyfriend's colleagues who are there to go 'hunting'.There's more partying, alcohol, booty, and a small plastic bag of peyote which the woman hides in her necklace for safe keeping. The next day one of the strange men comes on to the woman who is unwilling. He disgustingly rapes her all the while her boyfriend is off at a meeting and the other strange man does nothing to stop the rape from happening.The boyfriend returns, finds out about the rape but does nothing and becomes a complete asshole toward his girlfriend. She runs into the desert still in her panties. They chase her and end up catching up to her just so the boyfriend could push her off a high cliff no way in real life anyone could survive. But she did and sets off to start taking the guys out who did this to her one by one with lots of unrealistic squirting blood along the way.My Thoughts
The movie has a lot of holes and is extremely unrealistic yet I had a fun time watching it because of its senselessness. Remember the peyote she kept for safe keeping?That comes in extremely useful when she ends up hiding in a cave to heal her awful stomach wound after being pushed off the high cliff. She eats the peyote, cuts open a beer can, heats it up in the fire and sears her wounds shut.This was the most epic scene since she didn't scream at all. She was extremely high after all.Should You Watch It?
It's a senseless movie with lots of blood and booty. If that's all you want to see you'll love it. If not, I recommend skipping it.Thanks for reading and I'll see you next review.",Revenge

220,jay-j-smith,The clue is in the title.,7,25 November 2020,"Revenge doesn't do anything out of the ordinary. There is absolutely nothing here that hasn't been done before. It is the same script for every other rape and revenge movie ever made but set in a desert. However, what it does, it does extremely well.Revenge doesn't need to overly develop its characters. There are three antagonists who are bad and then your initially hopeless protagonist whose horrific experiences develop her into an action hero. Actually, this is part of the movie that I feel is done particularly well. A lot of these types of films go a bit overboard and turn their protagonist into a twisted sadist and it makes it difficult to empathise with such a character. Jen's transformation is almost perfect and she still keeps a sense of vulnerability throughout the movie. The antagonists are also all very dislikable and you find yourself wanting to see them suffer.The film is beautifully made. The camerawork is excellent and the music is brilliant. It's pretty violent. Definitely not as gory as some others in the genre but there is a lot of blood and close ups of injuries. Probably not one for the squeamish.There are plot-holes and also a lot of goofs which are pretty noticeable. I found myself looking through the goofs section on IMDb and immediately recognising them. Normally I'm not one to pick up on things like this, but they're clear to see. I get why some of them are there, but it does detract from the experience slightly.It's hard to give it higher than a 7 because it's so unoriginal and does have some small flaws, but at the same time, it's probably the best revenge movie I've seen.

But even if someone could survive it, and could burn the tree trunk to weaken it without catching fire themselves, and walk a long distance while impaled by a thick piece of wood and bleeding heavily, they wouldn't be able to pull it out and seal the wound simply by burning it with a cut-open heated up beer can, and it wouldn't have looked anything like a cool embossed tattoo a few hours later. And what about the hole in her back, where the tree trunk entered her body? It's obscured with mud, and there's no explanation provided as to how the hole is gone.My guess is that the screenwriter thought the impalement would make Jen more sympathetic, and it does to a degree, but it comes at the expense of believability.

That is a very stupid criticism -- this is a genre film first and foremost, and these are the basic elements one should expect from rape revenge exploitation films.

I Spit On Your Grave, Ms. 45, and Martyrs are on full display here as we get an ever explosive rape/revenge film with hemoglobin to spare.The pros here are the locales, cinematography, and score. Visually, this film is a sight to behold. Gritty and picturesque in the same measure makes for a breathtaking experience. While a French venture, this film feels more akin to an Australian exploitation film. The rocky, golden landscape appears straight from a 70's ozploitation cannon. The score is retrograde in the ways of John Carpenter and Tangerine Dream. Synth driven melancholic themes that drive each scene and character. Paired with the lighting and camera work, it makes for a nostalgic experience.The cons: The cast did the best they could ever achieve with the script. At the end of the day, there's not a likeable character in the bunch. Sure, we rally for the raped and abused heroine in the end, but even she isn't a ray of sunshine. A mistress at best, we're forced to identity with the ""other woman."" Not to say she isn't sympathetic and strong, but it takes a complete suspension of disbelief and prolonged development of ""revenge,"" that by the time we back her up to end the nightmare, it's so over the top that it doesn't matter anymore. The runtime is a factor. A lean hour and twenty minutes would suffice. However, we're treated to extended nightmare sequences, hunting/cover up scenes, and an over the top ending with lots of gore, but no logic. Overall, Revenge is a modern take on classic rape/revenge films of the 70's and early 80's.

If you're not scared away yet, ok, watch the movie; you'll probably find what you're looking for given the fact that the title of the film is ""Revenge"".

259,ryanlemm6,Stylish and Entertaining,8,9 October 2020,"Not sure why some of the reviews here are overly concerned about the realism. It's a very intense viewing experience. Surprisingly I watched this movie with my fiancé who hates scary movies but she really enjoyed this one. There's no denying the lead actress puts on a great performance and turns the slasher tropes back on her attackers. ***Spoilers:
In so many slashers a scantily clad girl is typically in a shower or bathroom when her killers come for her. In the final scenes when her ""boyfriend"" gets naked, goes in the shower and the final scene unfolds I couldn't help but smile.The most bada** part of the movie is when she takes the peyote, rips the stick out of her and cauterizes herself with the beer can. The subsequent tattoo my fiancé and I disagree on. I think it symbolizes her transformation in ""the eagle"" - a super predator, as we see her on top of a rock with huge binoculars scouting out her prey in the next scene. My Fiancé thinks it's more of a Phoenix rising from the ashes scenario. Either way do yourself a favor and watch this one with good speakers or headphones-the score is amazing.",Revenge

Some points it's art house with clear inspiration from Nicholas riding refn, panos cosmetos but not having the ability to execute it.
At other points it is an attempt at the horror gore that was massive around 10 years ago and quickly declined.People seem to not like the gore aspects of the movie, granted it is very over the top, but what was lacking for me was a story and possibly someone who can actually act.Very predictable and even the jump scares held no weight due to knowing they were about to happen..
The other issue I had was there was noting original about it, even the "" creative "" camera work had been done over and over and over and over, an attempt at a oneer is still not good as the actor can clearly be seen trying to cover himself up, and if he's doing that it just takes you out of the movie.And the cat and mouse stuff at the end is laughable.

273,klynnfarris,Unbelievable but brilliant commentary,7,19 December 2018,"Going into this movie, I thought I might end up having to turn it off considering most movies containing sexual assault take the scene far too over the top but it was just enough to get the point across and move the storyline along without sending me into a full fledged panic attack. They put the focus more on the horror and terror she was experiencing than actually showing the assault which I think is so important for a revenge-rape film and something I've never really seen before.The character setup made this movie so entertaining in my opinion. We have the rich older man cheating on his wife with a younger woman which clearly tells you he's not trustworthy but they show him speaking sweetly to his wife and being at least somewhat respectful to the young girl at first. The complete 180 he does when he turns out to be the most vile character said a lot to me about how little you really know about the people you put your trust into sometimes.The other two men introduced into the story gave a creepy vibe right off the bat. The man who committed the assault was later way more afraid of the consequences than appalled by his act and expresses violence towards the woman for daring to fight back. This coupled with the complacency of the second man and the violent reaction from the initial man really shed a light on toxic masculinity.The female lead was the best of all. I loved how they portrayed her as a fun and flirty party girl instead of somehow shy and reserved. This challenges the societal notion that some women are ""just asking for it"" which was one of the most important parts of this film for me.Yes the scenes were super unbelievable. There's no way any of them would have survived the injuries they sustained yet it definitely made for a fun experience with gore and blood that made me feel uneasy and squeamish and times when I typically don't feel that way. The fact that they made it so unbelievable that she would get away was kind of a letdown in terms of revenge because it feels like a woman could never get revenge realistically.However, the revenge was sweet. I loved her transformation into this vengeful hunting machine getting her revenge on these men who abused her and by the end I think the viewer feels just as satisfied as she does.The movie had a lot of decent Imagery and beautiful shots that held a lot of symbolism. If you like gore good cinematography and revenge you'll dig it. If you like your horror thrillers to be a little more realistic you probably won't.

The ONLY good thing about this movie is the cinematography. I am baffled as to why this movie has such a high rating. Maybe it hasn't been watched by many, maybe the people who watched it are part of the problem the industry has with the male gaze. Rape movies are SO overdone and I'm shocked this was directed by a woman. After reading an interview of hers I can see what she tried to do but I will say that she failed. This does not 'flip the script' on the male gaze. All it does is introduce a female gaze and throughout the whole movie the female lead is STILL under the male gaze, STILL scantily clad and STILL sexualized. It's infuriates me. All it does is reminds me of the female characters in video games which are almost always scantily clad.

Believe it or not, if you assume this to be the case right off the bat.. that is actually asking you to suspend your disbelief far LESS then if you don't assume this.So, this hot half vampire chic gets raped and and pushed off a 200 foot cliff and gets impaled through the back, sets the tree on fire to free herself and takes revenge.. now don't worry about that fall she took.. her half vampire side will have its healing powers kick in full strength. (Plus how do you think she survived a fall that would have made her look like pile of goo when she hit)Also due to her half vampire nature.. She can lose literally 5000 gallons of blood and still survive! She can also use her vamp speed to casually catch up to cars far away and pulling away from her by taking a shortcut over a mountain to catch up in no time.So she kills naked cyborg's buddies and confronts white naked cyborg at his house.. she shoots white naked cyborg.. causing another 5000 gallons of blood loss (yup.. 5000 gallons.. at least) BUT because he is in fact a cyborg.. it's nothing a little Saran wrap cant fix....See?

While it may not sound like the most original idea for a movie the way its crafted is both Beautiful an Violent at the same an it all flows together seamlessly. The Cinematography is Phenomenal so many of the shots are so perfectly handled. The performances are Great too, Matilda Lutz who's only other movie I think she's done is the 2017 Rings but this will be the role everyone talks about when referencing her in the future and I hope this helps get her more work in the future cause the character she plays at the beginning compared to who she is by the end Is so different cause the Arc she goes through develops an changes her so much, cause in the beginning she's just some Girl where clearly her Looks are all that matters cause the camera will lingere on her Body most of the time but its intentional, its almost mocking how Hollywood views Women like this in movies, so when she goes through all this stuff an changes from a Normal Great-looking Girl with not much substance to pretty much a Badass who should be a Female Hero people need to be talking about on the future when discussing Great Heroines, the other 2 actors who play the antagonists serve there purpose for what they need to do in a movie like this provide a Villain who can challenge the Hero in a entertaining way. Then we get the Action, the Action in this is very un-epic an I mean that in the best way it uses the small-scale of just 1 on 1 encounters, they make great use of a Desert that makes the movie more Harsh and Brutal with the setting they are able to blend Great Tension along with Intense Violence which makes the scenes where she faces of against these Guys very well done, once the Violence kicks off its doesn't let up till the Credits, its just pure adrenaline where once a scene starts your not sure how it will end, and with each encounter the Violence gets more an more Bloody and Brutal, they do not hold back with this movie an it all looks realistic which helps give it that Feel of early Grindhouse films with tons of Blood which is really what this movie can boil down to if that's what your looking for it can be a Fun, Bloodfilled, 100 minutes of entertainment or you can watch it as an Beautifully Shot, Intense, Movie that does Female Empowerment RIGHT this is one of the best movies I've seen with a Female Lead I enjoyed rooting for an wanted to see her win since I wanna say Kill Bill, Overall this is the some of the Most fun I've had watching a Movie this year and if there was one Movie I'd Reccomend this year this is it 8/10 Great Throwback while Reinventing a Otherwise Dead Genre",Revenge

Keep in mind, this is not a political film. Those factors are adjacent, but, important and very relevant.""Revenge"" is a film which doesn't reinvent, but does what it does really well, with moments of humour, horror, gore and violence. As its title suggests, ""Revenge"" is straight to the point with its plot, and straight to the point with its story and execution.The cinematography is STUNNING. Every shot is beautifully rendered and colourised, at times you almost feel like you're watching a music video, were it not for the tension of the moment.Fargeat also makes use of great sound design, especially in a pivotal scene which completely changes the tone and drives everything that happens afterwards. While a number of moments in the film are totally over the top, this scene (trigger warning) relies more on what you don't see.""Revenge"" blends moments of malegaze, horror, action, and feminist undertones to express its ride. Yes, there are definitely moments in the film which are not realistic, but they're not meant to be. This is where the revenge adrenaline kicks in, you ache for the pace to quicken, but you're kept locked into the pacing that Fargeat tells her story with.I LOVE that this film has feminist echoes: its plot, character exploration (not just the lead, but also supporting characters) its director and the excellent performance by Matilda Lutz. Lutz's performance displays a good dynamic range, evident through the spectrum of her characters experience.I came away from this film VERY satisfied.This is a great, solid watch.

316,TigersWood,Seek out I Spit On Your Grave instead,5,12 June 2018,"The latest entry in a 40+ year old sub-genre of rape/revenge exploitation films, Revenge is a movie that generated a lot of buzz and acclaim for the wrong reasons. The plot is familiar to genre fans who have enjoyed this fare for many years, although if critics are heeded, this time around it's fresh and new. 2017 truly was the year of the woman in America, and rightly so, everyone wants to see strong female characters mop the floor with the evil men who did them wrong. So many forget that this formula has been in place for a long time in genre films, and those same viewers disregard those earlier and more original forays into this territory simply because it wasn't in style at the time.Revenge tells a tale in a way that is fun and appealing to the senses - it's a beautiful and colourful sight to see, with plenty of ridiculous gore effects, blood and over the top scenes. It is admittedly a much easier pill to swallow than some of the harsh and disturbing takes on this subject from the past. Where it falls short of it's predecessors is amongst an almost constant barrage of absurd plot devices, eye rolling leaps of faith and banal stupidity in the actions of the characters on the screen. It ultimately adds up to a memorable, yet frustrating movie that I wanted to like, but couldn't force myself to enjoy. While watching, I found myself wanting to switch to I Spit On Your Grave, either version really - because both are far superior, if less attractive versions of the same film. ISOYG is challenging, difficult to watch some of the scenes, gritty and grimy, but will have you cheering for the main protagonist even as she enacts an extreme flavour of vengeance on those who harmed her. The revenge is much colder, calculated and cringe-worthy than this candy-coated stuff. If only they had waited until 2017 to remake it, it would have been perfect timing.In summary, skip Revenge and check out ISOYG instead - but caution, if you are easily rattled you may want to just stick with the easy, shiny, pretty, new Revenge instead.",Revenge

320,KellyCastlesbridge,"Not bad, if you can get around the misandry and feminist politics",7,13 May 2018,"From the way the film was described in the press, I thought I would totally hate it, as it would be full of misandry and man-hating feminist politics. There was some of that, especially how the men were portrayed. All the male characters were portrayed as negative stereotypes of the worst sort of men. They were not shown as human beings but as insensitive soulless creatures only driven by their own appetites. (similar to how the Jews were portrayed by Nazi propaganda films many years ago)This is at the heart of all feminism, is that it is hate speech, and at its core is filled with misandry and man-hating politics. If a film like this was made portraying these characters as Jews or a visible minority group (instead of white men), it would immediately be seen as hate speech and negative propaganda/stereotyping, but I guess when these sort of stories are done making these negative portrayals of white men, it gets a free pass. So if you can get around the negative and unfair feminist political message, and just watch the film as a light piece of violent entertainment fluff, you may be able to enjoy it for that. It is beautifully shot with excellent cinema photography, colors, and lighting, as well as a good soundtrack, much like a high-end music video. The story is a little light on content and certainly doesn't give a realistic or meaningful motivation for the main male character to kill his girlfriend. The idea is that he needs to do that to prevent all of them from going to jail, but he had NO PART in her rape, and could have easily called her a helicopter to take her home, and even testified against his male 'friend', who he didn't really like or respect very much. Certainly it makes no sense that he would commit and act of murder for him, risk going to jail for that, and take it so lightly. Its also very unrealistic that Jen could have survived her injuries and gone on to hunt down and kill 3 men. Being impaled by the tree would have given her a nasty internal infection that simple cauterization of the wound wouldn't be able to fix. The muscles in her torso would have been badly torn up, too much blood was lost, and she probably would have punctured kidneys or liver. There is no way that she would have had the strength or energy to do anything other than try to make it to a hospital, if she somehow survived. The amount of blood lost while walking through the dessert would have caused her to faint and die. She's also too small and weak to have carried all the equipment from her first victim, endured the dessert sun with no coverage or sunscreen, walk on hot dessert road barefoot for several miles, and make an elite head shot at a fast moving target in a jeep with no military training. (even a professional sniper would usually miss a shot like that while under duress). So it was not that believable, but, if you can suspend your disbelief, it is like a dumbed-down version of a female Rambo. There is some action, moments of suspense, and some amusement, so if you like blood, gore, and violence, you may find this entertaining. The main actress is beautiful and sexy and has a great ass; unfortunately they didn't show it enough. There was far more male nudity, and the film would have been much more enjoyable if she had been nude more, or at least as much as he was. So overall its somewhat entertaining as long as you can ignore the feminist political overtones and the obviously unrealistic parts, and just watch it for entertainment. I give it a 6.5 or 7/10 for that.",Revenge

349,b-ere-94,REVENGE IS GROUNDBREAKING IN A LOT OF ASPECTS ASIDE FROM ITS TITLE,8,5 August 2018,"The film, which was screened in the Midnight Madness section of the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, deliberately mixes clichés of classical rape-revenge films with twists and new approaches and I personally think that's because of the film's female director, Fargeat. Initially she presents Jen's body like the ""eye candy"" the male people around her thinks of her as, the camera fixates on her beauty and body and acts just as mesmerized with her as her male company. Therefore, the first act of the film could be described and argued as being shot with a male gaze - something I think is because Fargeat wants to challenge her audience and the stereotypes often surrounding rape-revenge films. However, for instance, then look how she chooses to portray the sexual assault scene. Then Fargeat obviously takes a detour from the conventions of rape-revenge films we've often seen and instead of sexualizing Jen's body at the time of the assault, portraying it as something more erotic than horrifying and violent and/or simply lingering on it an excessive period of time and using it as an excuse to show Jen/Lutz naked, Fargeat instead puts the focus on Jen's pain and makes everything about Jen's (facial) reactions. There's no identifying with the attacker and there's no denying Jen's constant pain and resistance.The characters in Revenge, and there isn't many, pretty much all play more or less on familiar stereotypes but they also go beyond simply being shallow stereotypes. For instance, take a look at the character Jen. We do not know a lot about her, just like with the rest of characters that's present, but it's very clear from the first second we see her that she is treated by others - and the camera - like this very pretty and sexy yet superficial young woman without much beyond simply her beauty. I think it was interesting to go in this direction when it came to Jen, considering what's about to happen to her. In a lot of rape-revenge films, the girls that are attacked are often initially shy and plain when it comes to physical appearance. Or they might be intellectual, rich and think that they're above certain people. In conclusion, there's a lot of different types of young women that are portrayed in rape-revenge films and I can list a lot more examples - but the main thing I'm trying to say here is that it isn't too often the young woman in question is so well-aware of her own beauty like Jen is and the fact that she doesn't hide it - not even after she's attacked by Stanley - is very refreshing to see. Way too often women are held responsible for what others do to them, even though when they're the victims and didn't do anything wrong and it's interesting to play around with this and to not make the rape seem like something that's either a form of disciplinary act to make the woman in question behave differently afterwards (in other words, ""better"") or make her appearance and behavior into something that's an excuse to attack her.No one really cares about Jen, she doesn't have any value beyond her beauty and her body. She's disposable. She's objectified, especially in the beginning of the film. She's put on a pedestal as a sex object by others, and when she doesn't act and react like her surroundings want her to, it results in violence both physical and mental. However, she always stays true to herself and what she's comfortable in and she's comfortable with her body. From the beginning to end she doesn't cover or hide her body, not before the attack and not after it. Often in rape-revenge films there's the vital turning point where the young woman who has been raped more or less goes through a transformation. This transformation often involves the woman changing her physical appearance, mainly with make-up, new hairstyles and, of course, through clothes. After Jen is left for dead and has to pull herself together in order to survive, she doesn't start covering her body which often happens simultaneously when the women becomes stronger and is seeking revenge. I liked that Fargeat skipped that metaphor and created a female character that did become stronger but she didn't become stronger at the expense of what she used to be. Being strong isn't about whether or not you're fully clothed or not, it's about you as an individual. Jen is herself from beginning to end, and that's quite groundbreaking considering how many extreme transformations of female characters that can be found in numerous rape-revenge films that sadly aren't as empowering as they at first glance may seem. Furthermore, in Revenge Jen's power and empowerment doesn't exclusively come from her revenge alone but also in the act of surviving and being a survivor.I think it all comes down to how the director chooses to portray the woman and, sometimes even more important, how the director chooses to portray the attack. Because, there's no denying that a lot of films that can be described as belonging in the category of rape-revenge films were specifically made to titillate a male heterosexual audience - and the motivation was often to gain economic success. Therefore, scenes involving the rape and attack can be found to be portrayed as something sexual and erotic instead of focusing on the violent and brutal violation and crime. An example out of many is Bo Arne Vibenius film Thriller - en grym film from 1973, which was a pure commercial venture simply trying to relieve the huge loss the director had put himself in with his earlier directorial debut. (Besides its highly sexualization, the film might be best known as one of the many inspirations for Quentin Tarantino and he apparently took the inspiration of the young girl, her revenge and her iconic eye patch when making Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2 and specifically for the character Elle Driver).[...]If you're watching one rape-revenge type of film this year, let it be Revenge. Not only is it very interesting and intriguing seeing this kind of story being told with a woman behind the camera, it's also visually stunning which isn't always the case with these kind of films. The climatic final fifteen minutes are still thrilling when I think about them and the final shot of the film is honestly one of my favorite final shots in a long time. I might actually go back and watch it again simply for that final shot, so now you all know I'm serious.",Revenge

She wakes up, impaled to a small tree and immediately knows to burn a bush close by in order to get down, even that wouldn't get her down with burning her to death3. She has to be Superman's sister, cos she lost more than 10 litres of blood, no food, only a can of beer and still had the stress to hunt tree armed men. 4. Takes the stake out of the wound, burns the front, passes out but somehow she was able to still burn the bad too?

368,blissmarshar,Never Judge a Movie by it's Audience.,7,14 May 2018,"Revenge seemed to cause quite a stir with audience whether it be because of its bloody violence, or causing a discourse between feminists and male moviegoers. Either way, there is quite a bit of enjoyment to be found with Revenge. This is through and through an action movie that has been flipped around and challenges the male gaze with strong female roles and wonderfully composed shots. I loved the lead role, and how strong the symbolism is, even if it is a bit on-the-nose, watching this film felt like reading a gritty comic book. The tension in this film winds like a guitar string and sends the finale off with a resounding bang. 
I wish there was a bit more character development with this film. Though the shots are beautiful and the film is well acted, Revenge throws you into the mix of things without explaining too much what's going on in regards to the characters. The plot itself is simple to understand, I would have just liked to see more complex villains. Seasoned movie watchers will pick up on context clues, however I would have liked to see a bit more character development with our main villain. The plot takes a backseat to the high-stakes tension, and artfully composed shots. For those who can suspend their disbelief in regards to how people heal from serious injury, you will have a lot of fun with this movie. 
There seems to be a substantial audience that are offended by this movie due it being 'feminist propaganda,' which truly baffles me. This is a classic revenge tale which we've seen hundreds of times before. I'm not sure why making a woman the lead changes anything. Give this movie a chance.

I knew it was obviously a revenge story with a female protagonist, but I was unprepared for just how intense it would be. The film falls under that subgenre of ""rape and revenge movies,"" but it takes pleasure in subverting expectations and turning tropes of the genre on their heads.The film doesn't skimp on stylish visuals that range from stunning close-ups to gloriously gory shots. The penultimate scene at the end in particular unfolds as a labyrinthine ballet that is a masterclass in suspense. I got kind of a Mad Max type of vibe from the movie's desert setting and musical score.

I didn´t see the trailer,however I heard a lot of reviews of this movie that were(for the most part) positive,so I decided to give it a try and see what all the fuzz is about. And I REALLY enjoyed it. It´s surprising how many times Revenge destroys your expectations in purpose, for example,what you expect after watching the first act( wich was a generic way too handle the female protagonist and the villains) is completely different from what you get on the second and third act of it. The cinematography in this film is fantastic,there are many shots in this movie that are gorgeous. The plot is simple,but could have been way worser(if it took itself too seriously). The acting for the most part is good,the lead protagonist is highly expressive,being able to show you vividly the changes in her character. The highlight of the three villains is Stan,with the actor being put on horrible situations wich are very well deserved,considering his horrible actions,but you still feel bad for him,thanks tois carisma. The main villain,Richard,is one of my issues with this movie. I can see that the actor is trying his best(he´s not a bad actor by all means),however his character was lacking human emotions,making him the tipical,generically written character. Another issue in this movie is the first act of the movie,wich I know it was trying to be bad on purpose but it didn´t make me want to keep watching the movie,forcing me to stop and(thank god) give this movie a second chance. The cg in this movie,also considering that this is a independent film,could have been better. The makeup in this movie was amazing,from the little bits of dirt on the characters faces to the really disgusting injuries marked on the body,it´s all made with huge care. This movie is,or appears to be,heavilly inspired on Tarantino´s work,with the violence involved in it. Talking about the violence in this movie,i can see that many of them are useful,to add to the brutallity of a scene or to seem grounded or realistic,however there are plenty of scenes with violence that adds absolutely nothing to it. So,those with a weak stomach,DON´T WATCH THIS MOVIE. One of the little issues that i personally thought were useless is the amount of nudity on this movie. Usually the nudity is used to increase a raw scene,however,in this movie they were uselless. Sure,i can see why in the first act there were so many shots showing the lead´s body with close,because most of those are to show the audience what Jen is for all the villains at the moment,however her nude shot and the lead villains nude appearences are completely useless. In conclusion,Revenge is a good film that also represents a fresh breath in a completely over used genre,but it´s not perfect,the movie is good enough that it made me excited for the director´s next work,and,hopefully,see her direct a larger scaled movie.",Revenge

He tells the story of a girl that transforms from a wealthy guy's personal prostitute, to a MacGyver & Rambo-style touch chick. A great movie for those that love gore and sex scenes, but a total waste of time for others. It features an interesting soundtrack that is very hard to find in American films, but anything other than that, fails miserably at making us feel or learn anything.

This film is a lesson to all young directors that want to make a film without proper research. Mescaline (psychedelic compound found in Peyote) is not a painkiller and one cannot just take it and then proceed to take care of their lethal wounds with total lucidity.I can't understand why he resorted to dumb and realistically impossible solutions to progress the story. How can one brake a dead tree by setting it on fire, in a matter of seconds? How can a person survive a 20m fall on a tree before being impaled by the latter right in the stomach? She then starts walking and fighting with a piece of wood still bulging out of her before going into a cave to extract it by cutting more of her flesh with a knife and pulling it forward instead of pushing it backwards...Film is art. You can't go to film school and pretend to be a director just because you know how to construct a story, use a camera and employ practical effects. If Fargeat ever finds a good script, she could succeed in film making, but no matter how many good reviews this one gets, it deserves nothing more than a ""meh""...Nonetheless, I'm glad to see more women directing films. Not to turn this into some political rant, but women deserve recognition for their magnificent existence. Males have abused them for too long, it's time they take the power and kick our asses once and for all. Just do your research Coralie, and be more realistic in your storytelling. Imagination is very important, but you either make a fantasy film like LOTR and Star Wars or you don't employ crazy ways to survive and fight after a guaranteed death.It's usually pretty easy to explain the difference between a film and a movie. This one is a movie. No wonder American teenagers are loving it; maybe if they received proper education, they wouldn't waste their time with this.",Revenge
426,obatard-09913,Pretentious style over mediocre substance,2,27 June 2021,"Honestly, I don't watch many modern French horror movies, because I feel disappointed each time. So many years later, I tried ""Revenge"". A few second after the end of the movie, I thought : ""this a movie from a director who doesn't know or like horror movies"". It's harsh, right? But I haven't changed my mind. There is a fancy cinematography, some great shots in the desert, some beautiful people but that's it. I'm a huge fan of Zeir Marchi's ""I Spit on Your Grave"" and I have to admit that ""Revenge"" failed to describe to horror of rape and the cathartic violence. There is plenty of violence in ""Revenge"", but there is not enough acting skills to make it interesting. It's just blood and guts without soul. Or the most excruciating pain from a rape is perhaps psychological and it requires some great acting and a good script. Here the script is incoherent and unrealistic. I don't mind some lack of realism, but this is too much, mainly because the movie doesn't choose between realism and imaginary. As many French movie, all of the efforts are used to make some fancy shots at the expense of the story and the characters. Barrels of blood with soulless characters and mediocre script don't make a good horror movie.",Revenge

Also super unrealistic. When the women was waiting to take a shot on the bad guy filling up his gas I noticed she is aiming down the sight that seemed to magnify pretty far. But the sight was attached to a double barrel pump action shotgun. When she shot from so far away there was no spread. Just one impact hole as if it was a rifle. If your going to try and make a believable movie you could at least use a proper prop gun. There not that expensive for a fake gun",Revenge

The acting is so terrible and the characters are so unrelatable that you just wish the movie would end as soon as possible with all of them dying painfully. And they go through a lot of painful instances but somehow, through all the blood-loss, wounds and all, they keep staying alive.
