0,MartinHafer,A funny little time capsule.,8,13 August 2010,"I think ""Nine to Five"" probably resonates more with people of my generation and earlier than it would with kids today--though its appeal still is timeless. I watched the film with my teen, and she laughed her head off at the antics of the film so much that now she wants to go see the play.Let me digress a bit and say that the quality of this film says a lot to me personally, as I am NOT a fan of Jane Fonda (you may well guess why) yet I heartily recommend the film. Plus, whatever my feelings about the actress and her politics, she did do a good job in the film.The plot is probably very familiar to most of you, so I won't explore it in any detail. Suffice to say that the boss is an evil sexist pig and three women in his office decide to pay him back for his dastardly ways. Had this just been a film about sexism, it might have come off as preachy. Instead, as it's a rather clever comedy, it seems less preachy and just fun--and still makes its point. My favorite parts are the fantasy sequences (especially the Snow White-inspired one) and I must admit that while it's a wonderful film, it does slow down a lot after Dabney Coleman's character is kidnapped. Still, overall it's a very good film for the whole family that is excellent in every way...and an interesting little time capsule at that.",9 to 5
1,bkoganbing,"""Poured Myself A Cup Of Ambition""",8,3 May 2010,"While watching Nine To Five, I couldn't help but think about the Billy Wilder classic film, The Apartment. Part of the plot of that film was Fred MacMurray, a more polished version of Dabney Coleman from this film who also used his office and position of authority to behave like a real pig. I thought about poor Shirley MacLaine who tried to commit suicide and eventually found love with Jack Lemmon, but both faced an uncertain future albeit with each other.Shirley and the other of MacMurray's victims should have seen this film and taken a lesson from Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Dolly Parton who start as strangers and end up as allies and who find a way to get even with Dabney Coleman for using and abusing his employees.All three women are different, different in real life and playing different types of characters in the film and at the beginning not really liking each other because they don't know each other. Tomlin is the efficient office manger who makes Coleman look good because he takes credit for her work. Fonda is a new employee who had to go back to work because her husband left her. And the beautiful and curvaceous Parton is Coleman's secretary who Coleman is trying to jump her form and the folks in the office think he already has.But eventually these women make common cause and what they do to Coleman is an inspiration to working women everywhere.As good as these women are the film would go nowhere without Dabney Coleman who makes a specialty of playing men you love to hate whether in comedy or drama. He's as big a sexist pig as MacMurray and a whole lot funnier.The supporting cast has some real interesting roles as well. Elizabeth Wilson plays the office snitch and anyone who has ever worked in an office you can count yourself lucky if there are only one of those in your place of work. And they don't have to necessarily be women. I also liked Marian Mercer as Coleman's completely clueless wife. And movie veteran Sterling Hayden comes on in the end as the chairman of the board of the company who in his own earnest, but clueless way settles all their problems.To Dolly, Jane, and Lily who took action for put upon employees everywhere, we did love you in this film.",9 to 5
2,SnoopyStyle,nice fun likable group,7,23 October 2015,"Judy Bernly (Jane Fonda) is new to the clerical pool. Her husband left her for his secretary. Violet Newstead (Lily Tomlin) is the veteran tired of getting passed over. Doralee Rhodes (Dolly Parton) is the secretary to sexist boss Franklin M. Hart Jr. (Dabney Coleman). She is ostracized for a false rumor of having an affair with the boss. The three women become friends after a constant series of injustices by Franklin. Some misunderstandings lead the girls to believe that Violet accidentally poisoned Franklin. Franklin finds out and tries to blackmail Doralee. That is when Doralee takes him prisoner.This is not as funny as one may expect. At least, there are no big laughs. This has a black comedy edge to it. It is likable enough. The three women have great chemistry. And Dolly Parton has that iconic song. Coleman is a great chauvinist.",9 to 5
3,claudio_carvalho,One of the Best Comedies Ever,8,6 March 2018,"On the first day of the secretary Judy Bernly (Jane Fonda) at the Consolidated Companies, the senior office supervisor Violet Newstead (Lily Tomlin) is in charge to introduce her to the coworkers. Judy was a housewife that has never worked but after her recent divorce, she is forced to find a job. Violet explains that their boss Franklin Hart Jr. (Dabney Coleman) is a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot and his secretary Doralee Rhodes (Dolly Parton) is his mistress. When Violet develops a method to increase the profit of the company, the opportunist Franklin backstabs Violet and presents the wok as if he had made it. Later the chauvinist Franklin does not promote Violet. He also spreads rumors about Doralee and mistreats Judy. When Violet accidentally put rat poison in Franklin´s coffee, he has an accident with his chair, hits his head on the floor, loses consciousness and drops his coffee on the floor. He goes to the hospital and Violet and her friends believe he had died. When Franklin returns to the office, his snitch learns what happened and he blackmails the secretaries that kidnap him. Now Violet administrates the office with Judy and Doralee and they discover that Franklin is stealing Consolidated Companies. How can they prove?""Nine to Five"" is one of the best comedies ever. The timeless story is still very funny thirty-eight years after the release in 1980. Lily Tomlin is one of the best comedians of Hollywood and she shines in this comedy. Jane Fonda is also very funny in the role of an uptight woman recently divorced. The country singer Dolly Parton is the great surprise with a good performance. Dabney Coleman is also great in the role of the chauvinist Franklin Hart Jr. The fantasies of the women of how they would like to kill their boss is one of the greatest moment of this film. The conclusion with Franklin sent of the jungle in Amazon is delightful. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Como Eliminar Seu Chefe"" (""How to Get Rid of Your Boss"")",9 to 5
4,gavin6942,Pretty Amusing,7,24 April 2015,"Three female employees of a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot (Dabney Coleman) find a way to turn the tables on him.I really knew nothing about this film going into it, and did not necessarily have the highest of hopes. Judging a book by its cover, this could be seen as a ""chick flick"", but it is most certainly not. This is a clever, humorous comedy that really came at the right time.This is an especially good role for Lily Tomlin, who has plenty of good roles in her career. The morgue sequence... wow. That is some dark, morbid humor that was completely unexpected, but also saved the picture for me. Sometimes you just need a little darkness to get the laughs.",9 to 5
5,lee_eisenberg,for anyone who's ever hated their boss,10,9 May 2005,"Ever wanted to take revenge on a really creepy person? Well, Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton do just that in ""Nine to Five"". After their undesirable-in-every-way boss (Dabney Coleman) threatens to have them arrested after a misunderstanding (it's a long story), the three take him hostage and institute progressive policies in the office.Especially a hoot is the mixture of characters: Jane Fonda is the mousy newcomer, Lily Tomlin is the goof-off, and Dolly Parton is the hillbilly. No matter what happens, they always have a solution, even after a bizarre mix-up in a hospital.I recommend this to everyone.",9 to 5
6,jboothmillard,Nine to Five,5,20 March 2012,"The title song I have obviously heard many times on the radio, on television and in films, it is probably the only one know I really know from the famous country and western singer, I was interested to see the film that the song came from, and the acting debut for the singer. Basically at Consolidated Companies, three female office workers, secretary Judy Bernly (Jane Fonda), senior office supervisor Violet Newstead (Lily Tomlin) and fellow secretary Doralee Rhodes (twice Golden Globe nominated Dolly Parton) have had enough with their boss. The company boss Franklin M. Hart Jr. (Dabney Coleman) is a sleazy, selfish, sexist, misogynist pig who takes advantage of all his female employees, and the three colleagues plan to get their revenge on him. There are a couple of instances where they may be contemplating killing him, and there is an accident where they think they do, but they settle instead with simply teaching him a lesson by trapping him in his house, making him see the error of his ways. By the end Hart has very much learnt his lesson to treat women much better, and the end credits say that Judy, Violet and Doralee went on to better careers and stuff. Also starring The Asphalt Jungle's Sterling Hayden as Russell Tinsworthy, Elizabeth Wilson as Roz Keith, Henry Jones as Mr. Hinkle, Lawrence Pressman as Dick Bernly, Marian Mercer as Missy Hart and Renn Woods as Barbara. The three female stars all do their vengeful characters as well as they can, the one that stands out for me is indeed Parton, and Coleman is a good choice to be the bastard mistreating them, I will admit it is not the funniest and most original film, it isn't such a bad comedy though. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for Parton's title song (also nominated the Golden Globe). Worth watching!",9 to 5
7,Tweekums,"How to deal with a 'sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot' boss in '80s America!",8,24 January 2019,"It is Judy Bernly's first day at work and she is being shown around by Violet Newstead. She introduced to new workmates and boss Franklin Hart, Jr. It soon becomes clear that Hart is a 'sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot'... he gives a man a promotion over Violet despite her greater experience and lets the office know he is having an affair with his secretary, Doralee Rhodes despite the fact that she has rebuffed all his advances. It all comes to a head one day and Judy, Violet and Doralee end up talking about how they would like to kill him... then, following an accident, it looks as if one of them has really killed him... their lives are about to get complicated.This office based comedy really stands the test of time; the technology and big hair may have long gone but the basic story still feels fresh and is certainly still funny. That are plenty of laughs throughout the film although most come after the women start talking about killing Hart and then deal with the consequences when they fear one of them has accidentally poisoned him. The fantasy sequences may be a little cheesy, one even feature Disney style cartoon animals, but I found them rather funny. The three female leads; Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton are great as Judy, Violet and Doralee; three distinct characters whose developing friendship feels real. Dabney Coleman is equally great as Hart; he makes the character easy to dislike while still keeping him very funny. The film has a clear message about how women are treated in the workplace; this might not be subtle but it never felt like a lecture. There isn't much to offend in the film; just some comical sex references... I can only imagine the UK '15' certificate is because the three protagonists enjoy a joint together and are shown to have a good time rather than any negative effects. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody wanting a good laugh who enjoys '80s films, especially ones with strong female leads.",9 to 5
8,moonspinner55,Occasionally perceptive office comedy eventually becomes arms-flailing cartoon,6,28 September 2005,"It had to happen: for two-thirds of its length, ""Nine to Five"" is a sharp, satirical, recognizable put-down of work-a-day life ""at the office"", but in its later stages it becomes a silly revenge comedy, and then a message piece. The messagey last act is the real bummer, with three secretaries taking over their work-place and transforming it into a politically correct nightmare. Jane Fonda is Judy, a just-divorced woman new to office work, and her starchy appearance and nervous manner aren't really all that funny (she's immediately cold to secretary Dolly Parton on the basis of office gossip alone); her character's big flub in the copy room is an example of director Colin Higgins' use of silliness--and it's not even to make a point (the Xerox machine goes cartoonishly haywire and Judy just looks like a jinx). Lily Tomlin is much better as Violet, a 12-year team player who keeps getting passed over for promotions--but why she would even want to be promoted into a den of thieves and liars is never really made clear. Dolly Parton is dazed but not frazzled--she's just pleasantly zonked as Doralee, whom everyone thinks is sleeping with the boss (Dabney Coleman--who only shines in the fantasy sequences; his Mr. Hart is a tiresome tyrant who, of course, is not just a show-off and a cheat but an embezzler as well!). Terrible-looking movie with an excruciating background score manages to get laughs with some canny writing (in the first hour or so) and because of Tomlin's dead-on impersonation of a working widow with kids who just wants her dignity. But the plot-twists in the second-half take the picture off-track, leading to a storybook ending that is commercially driven--and not even in keeping with the cynical, satirical tone of the early part of the film. **1/2 from ****",9 to 5
9,edwagreen,9 to 5-Work Was Never This Much Fun ***,8,30 September 2009,"No question that this is a very funny movie thanks to the gifted performances of Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Dabney Coleman and Dolly Parton. Parton's Oscar worthy song 9 to 5 immediately captures a positive mood in this tale of 3 women who gang up on their miserable boss who has subjected them to sexism in every sense of the word.The real surprise in this film is Fonda's performance. She goes from a woman who acts and dresses as if she is a spinster teacher to one who is quite hip.There are some silly moments when the 3 women imagine how they will get rid of boss Dabney Coleman. The mix up at the hospital, though inane, is needed to keep the story going.A wonderful film depicting the changes of roles of women in the workplace, changing conventional ways of doing things in the office, and a marvelous cat and mouse relationship made by the women and Coleman to get the goods on each other",9 to 5
10,Doylenf,It almost seems quaint to see all those typewriters at the office...,5,10 October 2006,"NINE TO FIVE starts out with a good idea for a comedy involving such able players as JANE FONDA, LILI TOMLIN and DOLLY PARTON in a story about three secretaries who are fed up with their boss--the male chauvinist pig from hell--DABNEY COLEMAN in the film's funniest performance. He's a pencil dropping boss who likes to see Dolly crawl on the floor for obvious reasons.But after awhile it becomes a little tiresome. Fonda's character is just a little too innocent to survive more than a day in this kind of streamlined, sophisticated office, Tomlin is a schemer out to avenge all the men she trained who got promoted, and Parton is always amazed that men notice she's wearing sweaters two sizes too small for her bust. And the humor is so obviously of the '80s era, with feminism and sexism as rampant as Women's Lib jokes.It passes the time quickly as an average comedy with a nice title tune sung by Parton, but it's nothing special. Biggest laugh getter is Coleman as the boss who infuriates the girls to the point of being kidnapped so they can rearrange things at the office in his absence.Final note: There's something quaint about seeing all those typewriters on every desk (Selectric IBM's, I presume) instead of computers.",9 to 5
11,preppy-3,Dated but still quite funny,8,18 December 2004,"Three secretaries (Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda) work for a sexist pig of a boss (Dabney Coleman). One day Tomlin accidentally poisons his coffee with rat poison...and then things go barreling out of control.I saw this back in a theatre in 1980. I thought it was hilarious and very well done. Seen now it's VERY dated (typewriters are used and Tomlin has to wait a MONTH to get invoices!) but it's still very funny. The script is well-written and well-directed by Colin Higgins (especially during the fantasy sequences). The casting is also letter perfect--Parton is terrific in her screen debut and Tomlin matches her word for word. Fonda isn't that good but her role is pretty bland anyway. Coleman is also wonderful as the sleazy boss. And the opening sequence with Dolly Parton's Academy Award-nominated title song is just great!Times have changed since this was made. Coleman's character wouldn't get away with any of the things he pulls in this movie nowadays (thankfully). And it does get more than a little silly and unrealistic at the end...but the three stars keep it on track.Worth catching--I give it an 8.",9 to 5
12,CinemaSerf,I wouldn't want to argue with them...,7,28 March 2020,"I can't help but think that if some of the folks churning out the bad-ass ""girl power"" nonsense of the naughties were to look back at films like this; they might see a clear demonstration of what real girl power actually is... Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton are three working women at various stages of the corporate food chain - presided over by their womanising , parasitic boss Dabney Coleman. Initially suspicious of each other, they unite over some of Tomlin's teenage son's weed and decide to take matters into their own hands. What follows is at times a laugh-out-loud comedy as they manipulate and reek revenge on their hapless, helpless boss. It could never be called subtle, but it does illustrate clearly that wits and guile are more than enough to achieve their aims without the need for long fight scenes; flashing their flesh and/or continuous bad language. The title song isn't bad, ether...",9 to 5
13,Boba_Fett1138,The theme song is more memorable and legendary than the movie itself.,6,18 July 2006,"This is a fairly amusing comedy that has some good strong female characters in it and also makes a good social statement. However as a comedy it falls flat at times, since it heavily relies on just the three main characters, played by Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda.The movie begins good and sort of satirical, about the male domination at the office. The boss of the office floor is portrayed as a 'sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot'. It's of course overdone but the movie makes a good statement. Therefor the movie works well as a social satire about the male supremacy- and the office work in general. The women are portrayed as strong individual personalities. However as the movie progresses the story becomes more and more silly and unlikely. The movie therefor then looses some of its power.The three main characters are good and strong, mainly because they are being played by excellent actresses, that seem to know how to handle the comedy genre. The movie however very much relies on this three main characters with as a result that the movie looses its focus on the story at times. The story at times becomes muddled in and the filmmakers seemed to prefer to show the three women their antics instead. Some of the moments are funny but at the same time also far fetched, which makes this movie a rather simple comedy. Sure, it's good fun to watch but it also makes this movie quite a forgettable one. It's just not a movie that I want to re-watch again, any time soon.Even though this is an 1980 movie, it still has a typical '70's feeling all over it, which means that it's also quite outdated to watch this days. Even though the male supremacy in the business life is still a relevant and much alive subject of course, even now, more than 25 years later.Amusing relevant comedy but it doesn't leave a lasting impression, due to its flawed focus and storytelling.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9 to 5
14,view_and_review,Strong Start Then Waned,5,29 November 2019,"This movie had a strong start then waned.I thought it was going to be a clever movie of how three oppressed and mistreated working women were going to flip the script on their chauvinistic and bigoted boss. Well, that kinda happened but it wasn't clever at all, it was just a series of sloppy events that fell in their favor. It went steadily downhill from the marijuana trip onwards.Lily Tomlin was good, she's a pro. Jane Fonda looked out of place and Dolly Parton was pretty weak, though I give her a lot of credit for the theme song--it's top 20 in my book for movie theme songs. I wanted to like the movie, I really did, and it wasn't all bad. But when's the last time you complimented someone by saying, ""You're not all bad."" Like saying someone is not ugly, it's not the same as saying they're pretty.",9 to 5
15,Uriah43,Three Office Workers Seeking Revenge Upon Their Abusive Boss,6,9 July 2021,"This film essentially revolves around three female office workers by the names of ""Judy Bernly"" (Jane Fonda), ""Violet Newstead"" (Lily Tomlin) and ""Doralee Rhodes"" (Dolly Parton) who each have different personalities and lifestyles but one common problem-their boss ""Franklin Hart Jr."" (Dabney Coleman) who is abusive in the extreme to each of them in one way or another. For example, although Violet--as his senior assistant--is clearly more competent and knowledgeable than Franklin, she is treated with contempt and has all of her original ideas stolen by him while she gets none of the credit. His personal secretary, Doralee, on the other hand has to continually ward off his overt acts of sexual harassment to the point that everyone else in the office assumes that she is having an affair with him. As far as Judy is concerned, being new to the job she is trying as hard as she can but whenever she makes an innocent mistake soon discovers how horrible and unforgiving he can be. That being said, after one particularly bad day for all three of them they innocently fantasy about how to obtain their revenge upon him with Violet pretending to put poison in his coffee and subsequently throwing him out of his high-rise office window. While all three of them think her idea is completely hilarious what they don't count on is Violent accidentally mistaking rat poison for artificial sweetener and putting it in his coffee that next morning-and this creates problems for everyone involved. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a decent comedy which was quite popular when it first came out but has lost some of its appeal over the ages. Even so, it still has some humorous scenes here and there and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",9 to 5
16,anaconda-40658,Nine to Five and Three Women.,10,23 March 2016,"Nine to Five (1980): Dir: Colin Higgins / Cast: Jane Fonda, Dolly Parton, Lily Tomlin, Dabney Coleman, Elizabeth Wilson: Observant and hilarious view of women in a working world dominated by males. It takes place in an office building with recently divorced Jane Fonda arrives for her first day. Lily Tomlin plays a working mother who has seen it all and handles the demands like a pro. Sunny Dolly Parton is so full of life yet she feels bad when ignored by co- workers due too untrue rumors spread by the boss. Through an awkward set of events blackmail plays a factor and they kidnap their boss and create a better working environment. Funny and clever with appealing revenge fantasies played out during an evening of smoking pot. Insightful directing by Colin Higgins who previously made the spy comedy Foul Play. Fonda, Tomlin and Parton are hilarious with Dabney Coleman perfectly cast as the chauvinistic boss. Elizabeth Wilson is amusing as Coleman's nosy assistant who spies the the women. All three women are from different backgrounds, with Fonda dealing with her ex-husband's attempt to mend, Tomlin dealing with bickering children, and Parton sent out to buy scarves for her boss's wife that end up being given to her. Plus an ending where everybody seems to win including the boss who encounters deja vu. Strong statement of woman's rights result in a true comic gem. Score: 10 / 10",9 to 5
17,HotToastyRag,A Must-See for Working Women,10,30 September 2017,"Dabney Coleman is the boss. Under him are floor manager Lily Tomlin and personal secretary Dolly Parton. They don't get any respect, and neither do the other female employees at the company, even though he's less competent than most of his underlings! When Jane Fonda, fresh from a divorce, enters the workforce and gets a taste of his attitude, the three ladies commiserate and become close friends.For any woman who's been disrespected by her boss, felt the pressures of being the breadwinner in the family, or been unfairly treated at work, this movie will be your new best friend. It's absolutely hilarious, but with enough realism to make you feel the sting alongside the characters. Dolly Parton was nominated for an Oscar for her catchy and true-to-life title song, and she'll win you over in the first three minutes of the film. Lily Tomlin becomes the poster child for feminism as she delivers powerful speeches, and Jane Fonda is adorable in her frumpy wig and oversized glasses. On her first day of work, she's reduced to tears because she doesn't know how to work the copy machine. Anyone, man or woman, who's ever had a first job will relate to her in that scene.9 to 5 will keep you quoting Patricia Resnick and Colin Higgins's screenplay long after it's over. You'll pout to imitate Dolly and say, ""That hurt my feelings!"" and puff out your chest declaring, ""Hit the road Buster; this is where you get off!"" like Jane—and you'll never look at your coffee sweetener the same way again.

The women fantasize about revenge(in a colorful series of vignettes) but unexpectedly get their chance one day, and things will never be the same again... Good cast, especially Coleman in a most memorable performance, and though it starts out well, it eventually takes a sharp-left turn into contrived absurdity, and never recovers, despite almost redeeming itself with a bright ending.

Remember when typewriters were the computers of our time and on every office desktop imaginable. Anyway, I liked Peggy Pope and Marian Mercer as well but you can't top Tomlin as divorced mother of four Viola, Dolly's Doralee happily married to a country singer, and Jane's Judy who is not always goody two shoes. The three women become friends and smoke a joint after their boss played brilliantly by Dabney Coleman. I think the cast just had such a grand old time making this movie that there is still talk of a reunion and the four major cast members reunited last year for Jane's charity benefit in Atlanta, Georgia. I loved the scenes where they imagined giving Hart played by Coleman, a taste of his own medicine. The kidnapping is also worth watching as well. I can't forget Sterling Hayden. This comedy is one of the all-time classic comedies especially about working environments and women's rights. When these three women take charge, they make changes that brought differences to the working place where their employees became better people which means happier employees. I guarantee if you are an employer and you want a productive environment, you have to have a happy working staff regardless of the cost.",9 to 5
20,SimonJack,The office ladies tangle with and hog-tie an ogre,7,11 May 2021,"""9 to 5"" is a very funny movie. This is not a comedy of clever and funny dialog. And, it's only somewhat situational. But it's from the situations that it turns into one very hilarious romp. Three ladies at Consolidated have had their fill of their sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical, bigot of a boss. He may think he's hot stuff, but he's no match for Violet, Doralee and Judy.Of course, for the comedy to work in their getting even with Franklin Hart, he has to be a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical, bigot of a boss that no one in the audience could like but would like to see the girls, er, ladies get even with. And Dabney Coleman is such a boss. He plays the part perfectly. And so do Lily Tomlin, dolly Parton and Jane Fonda play theirs superbly.This is just a fun movie to watch. Even during the obvious moves by Hart early in the film, because one knows that he will one day get his. One of the aspects that makes this film work well, is that the ladies have fun when they coop up Hart and run the business on his floor in his absence. Rather than their gloating over his captivity, they are still humane and very human and enjoying every minute of their great coup.The ending is very good. One might have suspected that all the changes the ladies put in place might come back to Hart's credit, but then when the chairman of the board gets in the act, the ladies - and everyone else gets their reward. The funny credits at the end are a fitting close to this entertaining flick.",9 to 5

On its own, 9 to 5 is a decent comedy, led by the more-than-capable Lily Tomlin, but Parton infuses her scenes with a bubbly independence that really helps sell the feminist message. Dabney Coleman is the consummate company sleaze, the tinpot schemer helming this faceless conglomerate; ideal for the target of such a workplace revenge fantasy.In less capable hands, this may have fallen flat. But I enjoyed myself and have a newfound (overdye) reverence for The Queen of Nashville.",9 to 5
22,lasttimeisaw,as delightful and jolly as one can get in a comedy that has something to say but consciously eschews any trace of indoctrination,7,1 August 2018,"Three female company employees wage war against their ""sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot"" boss in this prototype 80s sisterhood comedy, 9 TO 5 is the late Colin Higgins' second feature film and flexes the muscle of female star power which not only brings down the house, but also sets alight its box office, the runner-up top-grosser of its year, second only to STAR WARS: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.The Fonda-Tomlin-Parton trinity embodies three different types of career women, Fonda's Judy is a housewife grossly jilted by her ex-husband for his secretary, so she is the greenhorn in the workplace, prissy but not without wits and guts, her frilly entrance is remarkably incongruous with the rest, although her clash with the boss Frank (Coleman) is most tangential among the three, her personal victory climaxed when she blurts out to her feckless ex-husband that being dumped by him is the best thing ever happened to her. Tomlin's Violet is a widow with a brood of four, the assertive senior office supervisor who has plodded for years in the company, yet the promotion she deserves proves to be unattainable because of Frank's sexism, and aggravated by being ordered about like a servant by him, she has every reason to get back at him; Parton's Doralee (her maiden picture, who also pens and belts out the Oscar-nominated title song), a corn-fed, bosomy secretary repulses the derogated stereotype as a boss-hunting schemer, who is indeed happily married and only humors Frank's advancement for the sake of the job, but in the face of Frank blabbering blackmail, she is the one who is not hesitant to pinion him like a steer.Truly, the triad enjoys a real blast together, initiated by a joint-influenced brainstorm about how each envisions a scenario to vent their grievance on Frank - here Higgins makes a good fist of genre conventions, whether it is a black-white mob thriller, a lasso-tossing oater or a Snow White animation with a dark spin, all are given a reality simulacrum later in the plot - and hits the mark during their hilarious blunder with the wrong body, although the resultant kidnapping idea is less wholly engaging for its yawning implausibility, not least when the deus ex machina comes about in the form of Sterling Hayden's chairman of the board, publicly asks equal pay to be eliminated from the reform program, which is actually conceived by the triad and executed by forging Hank's signature. Nonetheless, 9 TO 5 is as delightful and jolly as one can get in a comedy that has something to say but consciously eschews any trace of indoctrination, all three leading ladies are having a field day, but for my liking Tomlin is the one gets an upper hand for her steely nerve and comedic timing; as the antagonist, a versatile Coleman eloquently exhibits shameless wickedness to the hilt, and lastly, Elizabeth Wilson has her own moment as a brilliant tittle-tattler, who perfectly encapsulates the entire farce with a precisely uttered ""Holy merde!"" to bring down the curtain in the coda.",9 to 5
23,Rainey-Dawn,Cute Movie,5,21 October 2014,"9 to 5 is a very cute light-hearted comedy. It is worth viewing - if you have not seen it yet then you should if you are a fan of comedy films. It's quite funny to watch Jane, Lily and Dolly get back at their very stubborn no good male chauvinist boss played by Dabney Coleman.I think the movie shows woman power (female wisdom/intelligence as well) - women are stronger and smarter than what they think in a comical way. And the movie shows how some bosses misuse and abuse their position/power - being a no good boss is in fact, not good in a humorous manner.This movie would make a great matinée to liven up any afternoon. Make it a double feature with ""Best Little Whorehouse in Texas"" ""Witches of Eastwick"". 5/10",9 to 5
24,thesar-2,Hart to Hart to Hart,9,12 April 2013,"What lawyer wouldn't have a field day if Nine to Five happened today?Nine to Five is one of my all-time favorite comedies and as a comedy, with extreme deadpan delivery from Lily Tomlin (Violet) and excellent lines and acting from first-timer-at-the-time Dolly Parton (Doralee,) it still works. Sadly, this is the Stone Age when it comes to office politics and, of course, equipment. This is not to say sexist remarks or promoting males faster than females still doesn't occur, but I cannot imagine, as a whole, it's this blatant.While that's not a flaw, it was what it was 33 years ago, the movie's only flaw that I could concede is that it went on for far too long. It didn't know where to cut or when to end. And still, even with that minor fault, it's still amusing and fun through to the end.I truly loved this movie and it begins solid with one of my all-time favorite movie songs, the same name of the film and sung by the star, Parton. Following that, I loved the fact that the three central characters, Violet, Doralee and Judy (Jane Fonda) weren't exactly friends at first, but become allies when their over-the-top ""sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot"" of a boss wrongs them. While the movie was already fun at that point – mainly thanks to, again Tomlin and Parton, this is where the sh|t gets realfunny.From merely complaining, to pot smoking their way into incredible laughs (from both them and us) of their fantasies of getting retribution, to almost and inadvertently bringing one of their ideas to life, these ladies get in deep when trying to deal with the soulless boss.While I stated the movie, sadly, is dated for 1980 or that timeframe, it's also unfortunate that the same stereotypical coworkers exist today. Maybe that's reason #38 why I like this movie so much; I can relate as I've worked in offices since March 1996 and have seen all kinds of these characters portrayed here, in the almost equally hilarious Office Space and in pretty much any Dilbert strip.Now, that said, allow me to make sure I am revealing a positive. These secondary and third-tier characters make the movie even better. They're hilarious (""Atta, Girl"" said three times almost back-to-back is one of my favorite lines and so true from the office drunk) and realistic (there's ALWAYS an untrustworthy office spy/boss, kiss-up ""Roz"" character to deal with.) On the front end, there's also always the sarcastic and down beaten ""Violet"" (which is usually me,) the optimistic ""Doralee"" and the newbie, ""Judy,"" who ALWAYS will soon learn the hard way. Now, though I've encountered my share of horrible bosses – as well as awesome human managers, I've never worked under the reigns of the terrible ""Mr. Hart"" (played deliciously by Dabney Coleman,) although I know they exist as do his superiors as portrayed in this film.I didn't work in 1980 – I was at the young age of ___ then, and my mom was still a stay-at-home mother when this was released, but I know these events in the movie happened in real life and I am glad these talented ladies could theatrically fight for women's rights. It might not have seemed like a political film, and perhaps it wasn't meant that way, but I bet this brought to light a lot of the disgusting things that occurred to the female workers of the late 1970s, early 1980s.Oh, and speaking of that era, I've read and been told countless times that ""Jane Fonda was the DEVIL for her war-time actions"" prior to the movie's creation. While she wasn't my favorite part or character of the movie, she was still enjoyable in her role. I do my very best to stay out of filmmakers/star's politics. If I didn't, I wouldn't have enjoyed so many Tom Cruise films – and believe me, I have more fun in his action/comedy/suspense films than most actors over the past few decades.On a personal note, it truly pains me to hear someone tell me not to watch Fonda's movies, or worse, wish her dead. Without getting into the details of what she did, or even the reasons why, I don't care one bit. ""Did she entertain me when I watched this?"" is the only question I should be asking myself and the answer was: yes.I digress. This movie is hilarious, real fun, adventurous and it's one I could watch countless times, like I did as a kid. Highly recommended.Side Note: That song, Parton's Nine to Five, isn't just one of my favorite movie tracks, it's one of my all-time favorite songs. And funny story: when I was a kid and I would, indeed, watch this movie over and over, or listen to that song from one of my mother's, ah-hem, record player, repeatedly, I always thought the first few lines read:Tumble out of bed and stumble to the kitchen; Pouring myself a cup of bitchin'I was shocked, growing up in a swear-free household, at that word! It truly intrigued me. Until, of course, I grew up, got, what we call now: digital music, clear-sounding movies and, obviously, internet, and learned the true word was: ""ambition.""Eh, I think both fits.",9 to 5
25,paul2001sw-1,"Fun, but also interesting",6,23 July 2006,"'Nine to Five', a fun little film about office politics, also makes some serious points about sexism in the workplace. What's interesting is that the (always believable) stereotypes on view here appear dated: do people really behave like this any more? Probably not, and yet sexism is anything but dead. In some ways, the crass prejudice here almost seems to belong to a sweeter, more innocent world than the one we live in now, women may have a better chance today of successfully playing the sophisticated games needed to succeed, but is life really any better for the straightforwardly naive? It's an extreme comparison, but watching this film made me think of Neil la Bute's utterly horrible 'The Company of Men'. That film is a nightmare, this one a fairytale; the truth may lie somewhere in between, but it's worrying to think that the latter came first.",9 to 5
26,cricketbat,"Good, but not as enjoyable as the song",6,23 August 2021,"9 to 5 (the song) is a fantastic, toe-tapper that I always enjoy listening to. 9 to 5 (the movie) is okay. Dolly Parton is absolutely charming, Lily Tomlin is hilarious, and Jane Fonda, well, she's there. The tone of this movie is uneven, ranging from goofy comedy to somewhat dramatic. It never quite finds its balance. Plus, it feels different watching it now. It's definitely dated. I'll always love the song, though.",9 to 5
27,The-Sarkologist,Classic Get the Boss Movie,8,26 December 2020,"This is another one of those films that I literally grew up with, namely because my Mum would watch it whenever it came on, so we kids would basically sit down and watch it as well. Mind you, I'm not sure if we actually understood what was happening in some of the places, such as where they are smoking joints, or the fact that they have tied their boss up using bondage gear (or even the references to B&D made it into the film), but I certainly picked it up this time.At first it does start off a little dull. Basically we follow these three woman working in an office during the 80s. This means that everybody is using a type writer, and copying machines are massive. Mind you, they seemed to have takeaway coffee back then as well. Oh, and of course the idea of sexual harassment and discrimination didn't exist back then either, though I'm sure we all have bosses, or colleagues, that end up taking credit for our ideas (that is something that I doubt is ever going to go away).I guess the appeal with this film is getting back at a bad boss, and also in part literally getting away with murder (or kidnapping as the case may be). It really starts with a boozy night out (or more so smoking Marijuana in the living room) and coming up with ways of dealing with their rather annoying, and quite sexist, boss. It turns out that they accidentally put rat poison into his coffee as opposed to Skinny & Sweet, namely because they happen to be in a box that is the same colour, and same size.At first I wasn't too sure about this film, but the more I think about it the more I come to appreciate how clever it actually is. It seems to have quite a lot going on, and you think that the film is going to head in one direction, and all of a sudden it takes a massive turn and heads in a completely different direction. In fact, some of the aspects of the film are really clever, especially when it comes to the boss being tied up in his bedroom, as well as always appearing to be on the front foot with claiming credit for things that he didn't do, as well as the girls coming up with ideas to either change the workplace, or hide the fact that they have him tied up.It also seems to explore concepts that these days seem to be part and parcel of the business world, as well as struggles that we are still facing today. In fact it confronts the idea of sexism in the workplace, not just with sexual harassment, but also with the idea of equal pay, and also with the idea of non-discrimination (the guy in the wheel chair at the end is actually quite a nice, and rather subtle, addition). Obviously we also have the idea that people can be sacked at the whim of the boss, which sadly is still the case in many places, though not necessarily in Australia.It is quite good in that what we are seeing is a changing workplace, something that many of us seem to take fore granted these days (that is if the jobs haven't either been off-shored, or taken away by computers). Yet we are also still being confronted with changes that need to be made, such as with equal pay, and with discrimination, even though laws have been put in place to attempt to stamp it out. This is especially the case with equal pay since many workplaces make it a taboo subject (and society as a whole) to discuss how much you are actually being paid.",9 to 5
28,digitalbeachbum,Good PG movie,7,18 April 2021,"While the story is geared for adults, it is shocking to see that this is a PG movie. It has an all star cast, with a good script, good direction and no need for nudity or violence. It is about as wholesome as you can get and I wonder if Dolly had a lot to do with down playing all those typical Hollowood mistakes. The movie still holds up after 40 years and it provides a valuable lesson for the corporate world to stop being such dicks on how you treat your employees.",9 to 5

30,funkyfry,Fun but fluffy,6,24 January 2011,"Although this movie (or maybe just the title song) seemed ubiquitous in the early 80s when I was a young kid, you don't really hear people talk about it anymore and somehow I managed to never see it until now. I guess it's a ""zeitgeist"" film (did I get that right?), a film about a social movement that might not seem as urgent today. In 1980 this was an edgy movie, but today most the material would be tame for TV.However, it still has some weird laughs... I enjoyed some of the dream sequences, especially Dolly Parton with the lasso capturing Dabney Coleman the ""sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot"" boss. My wife and I both thought that Coleman and Parton were the most fun to watch in the movie. Fonda was trapped in this ridiculous character, a 1950s housewife stereotype brought into the modern era, and she never finds her footing or does anything interesting in the inevitable scene where she becomes a ""modern"" outspoken woman. Lily Tomlin does some good acting (the scene where she half-heartedly resists her teenage son's offer of a joint is typically solid), but her character didn't really take off for me either. But at least she covered it up better. Parton's just having a good time and it's a bit infectious. Coleman, one of our great under-rated character actors, has more to work with her than usual. He has several different layers of nastiness, and at least one layer of sympathy.I think the project is good, but just short of being really memorable or classic. I found the plot very thin generally, and that once the office situation and the characters had been set up so well there was nowhere up for the movie to go. The hospital sequence and the scenes in and outside of the car were tedious, and there are too many scenes of Coleman in his odd S&M getup. I would have liked to see the film maybe a bit more episodic, instead of settling into that whole story-angle about the rat poison for the entire length. Also I think the film's formula is too rigid and it ends up restricting the characters. The zany scenes clash too much with the serious scenes and it makes the whole thing feel a bit haphazard, because it's not directed with any vision that would have united them.With the story going so far and so long into the whole hostage situation, my sympathies weren't sticking completely with ""the girls."" The film tried too hard to make them heroic, despite all the bizarre stuff they were doing to Coleman's character. A good example would be the big confrontation I mentioned between Fonda's character and her ex-husband (Laurence Pressman). The way I saw it, he could easily have been a sleaze.... he obviously was to some extent, because he ran off with the secretary and so on. But nothing he does or says in that particular scene is so outrageous, that we should really jump to Fonda's side and cheer when she tells him off..... as we're obviously supposed to do, en masse. Unlike in somewhat similar films about office and sexual politics such as, say, ""Election"" and ""Office Space"", the protagonists are simply right in this movie and whoever gets in their way is wrong. Don't worry too much about the details, or expect any introspection along with the character development, because this movie ultimately is about female empowerment in the most generic sense of the term. I found it fun in a lightweight way, but it was too comfy with its own assumptions and the farce was too broad to completely please me.",9 to 5
31,southdavid,Relatively Fonda this.,6,15 March 2021,"The new 'Star' brand added to Disney Plus elevated a bunch of new films into my ""everything on Disney Plus in alphabetical order"" list, one of which was ""9 to 5"" the workplace comedy that's now 40 years old. Though I enjoyed some of it, it was a bit disjointed.Judy Bernly (Jane Fonda) begins working in a New York office following the breakdown of her marriage. She's shown the ropes by Violet Newstead (Lily Tomlin) a capable and important leader, whose been due a promotion for a while. When her boss, Franklin Hart Jr (Dabney Coleman) gives the promotion to a less qualified man instead Newstead, along with Bernly and Doralee Rhodes (Dolly Parton), Hart's secretary with whom he's implied he's having an affair, fantasise about getting their revenge. Then an accident threatens his life for real.""9 to 5"" was a massive hit upon its release and much of the humour, particularly of the early scenes still holds up pretty well - and sadly, is still pretty prescient. I thought the first third of the film, establishing the grievances and explaining what a jerk Hart is worked really well. I liked the fantasy element in the middle third less though - as the switch into them is pretty jarring and they're all fairly lengthy and outlast their amusement pretty quickly. It picked up a bit afterwards, as it becomes an unlikely farce. It's fun, in a cheesy 80's way, but the idea that it should have been darker with them genuinely trying to kill him is a seductive one.Fonda and Tomlin are in great form throughout, as admirable as Dolly Parton is, she isn't much of an actress here. She does, of course, provide the iconic song though.I didn't hate it. But it's just a bit too tonally uneven to really recommend it.",9 to 5

But the worst thing about this movie is it's completely silly humour, bordering on farce. Especially the middle part, is almost childish. I skipped that part.The good: the 3 actresses are divine. Dolly Parton is TERRIFIC. And so are Lilly Tomlin and Jane Fonda. Only to be recommended though for Dolly Parton fans or for 40 plus folks who like to look back on the eighties with fond feelings of nostalgia.Conclusion: dated, cheesy and farcical, but still quite enjoyable for a select few, who appreciate this silly eighties humour.",9 to 5
33,jzappa,Pleasant Entertainment Despite Its Unbalanced Attributes,8,24 February 2011,"In view of the activist aggression of this revenge fantasy, it might be apt that the funniest performance in the film is by Dabney Coleman, who plays unfair, chauvinistic company superior Hart. Hart is a fun bad guy, a bird-brained horndog so in the throes of his trifling infatuations that he's not beyond knocking his pencils on the floor so he can peep Parton picking them up on her hands and knees, her cleavage showing. There's some message sent by the fact that the biggest laughs in this feminist candygram hinge on wholehearted, unashamed sexism.Colin Higgins' infectiously amusing little 80s comedy starts as satire, skids indecisively into farce, and ends by intently flying the banner of feminism. It has some incredibly amusing moments, and then it has some key constituents that fall short, including some of its pot-induced fantasy sequences. It's pleasing entertainment notwithstanding its lopsided features and a plot that's almost too ridiculous for the material. The movie is present in the convention of 1940s screwball comedies. It's about ridiculous events befalling droll exaggerations of recognizable types, and, like those Hawks, McCarey and Stevens pictures, it's also laced with a mortal dose of social commentary.The implication in this case involves women's lib, particularly with the position of women in the corporate workplace. Fonda, Tomlin and Parton all work in the same office. Tomlin is the well-organized and very seasoned office manager. Fonda is the tenderfoot, having a go at her first job after a divorce. Parton is the boss's secretary, and everybody in the office thinks she's having an affair with him, so the other women won't have anything to do with her, until she finds out who's been spreading that rumor.Played by Dabney Coleman, Hart is unkind, exasperatingly self-righteous in his status quo worldview, with an immense and genuine yearning for Parton. She's having none of it. After the movie hosts some human and labor rights issues like equal pay and merit promotion, the movie expands into a peculiar plot to hijack Coleman in an effort to secure equality. He ends up swinging from the ceiling of his bedroom, fastened by wire to a garage-door opener.This entire kidnapping sequence moves so far toward unreserved travesty that it injures the movie's more realistic opening scenes. But maybe we don't actually care. We realize immediately that this is consciously a frivolous film, notwithstanding its yolk of sociopolitical import. And, affording the obligatory indulgences, we just lay back and enjoy it.",9 to 5

Jane Fonda plays a newly divorced woman who begins working at the company Lily and Dolly have been working at for a good while, with a boss who's speciality is sexual harassing his female employees and cheating to get rich. One day they all three decide they've had enough of Dabney Coleman's junk and decide to take revenge. The writing is very funny and clever. The writing plus the three main actresses together is what makes this film work. Dabney Coleman is perfect for the role of the sexist disgusting cheating boss, Franklin Hart. The movie makes you care deeply about these women and you just have no other choice but to pull for them. One thing you'll for sure get from the film is entertainment, it's not about heavy drama, it's all about comedy and having some fun. That's what I associate this movie with. Comedy and fun.

Hart Jr., greets her by saying she's ""a welcome addition, and a damn pretty one, too.""""I mean that,"" he adds. ""You should see some of the crones coming through here lately. Real pathetic.""It certainly was a man's world in 1980, when ""Nine To Five,"" Colin Higgins' warm and frothy satire of women in the workplace, came out. Some credit this film, produced by and co-starring Jane Fonda, with making a difference in bringing some R-E-S-P-E-C-T to the fluorescent jungle. But if ""Nine To Five"" has an overt feminist agenda, it is only in the sense of showing feminists really do have a sense of humor.Fonda plays Judy, a newly divorced woman forced into the office, where she soon makes friends with seasoned supervisor Violet Newstead (Lily Tomlin) and cheery secretary Doralee Rhodes (Dolly Parton), their bond formed in the crucible of cubicle misery overseen by the heartless Mr. Hart (Dabney Coleman). The three dream of ridding themselves of Mr. Hart, but when those dreams become a real-life nightmare, the three women must improvise fast.The film works so well because it refuses to take itself seriously, however much it is about the cause of working women. Righteous indignation is kept very far beneath the surface, as we instead are treated to scenes of mayhem and killer comedy, like when Doralee defends herself from one of Hart's lecherous advances.Doralee: But Mr. Hart, I'm a married woman.Hart: I'm a married man. That's what makes it so perfect!In the film's most hilarious sequence, Doralee fantasizes about having Hart be her secretary, and putting the squeeze on him instead, forcing him to wear a red scarf and keep her entertained. Hart's sex drive goes flaccid when the tables are turned. ""I won't kiss that mouth,"" Hart whines. You are laughing so hard, you hardly notice the point sinking in, that sexual harassment is about abuse of power more than lust and as much to be minded when its Dolly Parton pinching your bottom, which is how good socially relevant comedy is made.Obviously this film was a special labor for Fonda, given how she slips almost into the background, leaving most of the film in the hands of her non Oscar-winning co-stars. Tomlin is a rock, playing Violet as the paragon of office efficiency one moment, and Mama Meltdown the next. Dolly is sweet as sugar but tough on the inside, like when she warns Hart she packs a gun and will turn him ""from a rooster to a hen with one shot"" if he keeps pushing on her. Coleman may be the best thing in the film, playing Hart as a more subtle source of menace than you expect from reading the plot, then ramping things up as he is foiled by his underlings.Good comedy requires good control, and director Higgins, making only the second of three films in his short life, keeps a firm grip on a plot that puts Tomlin in a Snow White outfit and manages to get even sillier from there. It's a shame we didn't get to see him develop his art; he seems to have had a sensibility akin to Blake Edwards at his zany best.Even the film's weaknesses are tradeoffs on its strengths; amiable dream sequences that go on too long and a clever conclusion that is a trifle too pat. You can argue that the characters are shallow, but the message is anything but.That, along with the great comedy, is why ""Nine To Five"" was not only such a success when it came out but an influence on so many other work-oriented films to follow. (""Office Space"" features three cubicle buddies and an embezzlement subplot, ""Anchorman"" showcases sexual harassment and a score that conspicuously echoes Parton's terrific titles theme here, a number-one pop hit in the U.S. in early 1981.)

39,FloatingOpera7,9 to 5: A Woman's Lib Comedy,10,23 August 2006,"Nine To Five (1980): Starring Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, Dolly Parton, Dabney Coleman, Elizabeth Wilson, Sterling Hayden, Henry Jones, Lawrence Pressman, Marian Mercer, Ren Woods, Roxanna Bonilla-Gianini, Norma Donaldson, Peggy Pope, Richard Stahl, Ray Vitte, Edward Marshall, Earl Boen, Jeff Douglas Thomas, Alan Haufrect, Tom Tarpey, Michael Delano, David Price, Barbara Chase, Gavin Mooney, Peter Hobbs, Terence E. MacNally, Helene Heigh, Jerrold Ziman, Vicki Belmonte, Eric Mansker, Shirley Anthony, Esther Sutherland....Director Colin Higgins, Screenplay Patricia Resnick.Released in 1980, ""Nine To Five"" was a hit comedy for a number of reasons. It came at the right time. The late 60's and 70's had been a time of great improvement in the status of women in America, thanks to the ever-blooming Women's Liberation Movement, which called for equal rights and saw a new generation of women who went to college to get digress, held careers once dominated by men such as law, business, politics, medicine, you name it. Another reason was that comedies were better appreciated at this time, such as the well-made Mel Brooks comedies. Yet another reason was the star power of the lead actresses - veteran comedian Lily Tomlin, Oscar-loved Jane Fonda and country singer icon Dolly Parton. Their chemistry is absolutely remarkable and this comic film, with it's women's empowerment theme and witty script and overall zany mood would inspire films that would actually beat this film in similar themes, such as the mid-90's film ""The First Wive's Club"". The film is named after Dolly Parton's popular song ""Nine To Five"" which plays as the film opens and ends. Jane Fonda portrays recently divorced Judy Bernly. Once a kept house-wife, she must now work for a living. She finds work as secretary in a big industrial company in a major city. Her boss is the ""sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot"" Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman) who rules over his section of the building with an iron fist, cheats on his wife and does'nt appreciate the valuable asset that are such women as Violet (Lily Tomlin in a great performance) and Doralee (Dolly Parton). Tired of all the injustices from this sexist tyrant, the three women kidnap him, hold him hostage and threaten to blackmail him with the fraud he's been doing to the company. In the meantime, the women take over and conditions in the office improve significantly with such innovative and welcome changes as day-care, flexible hours and a feeling of being valued by the company. Mr. Hart learns a hard lesson by these three women who took matters into their own hands. Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Dabney Coleman are simply great together. The script is hilarious, and such scenes as the revenge fantasy sequences, the confusion with corpses at the hospital and the final portions of the film are the stuff of good comedy at the time. This was Dolly Parton's first film and she memorized everyone's lines as story has it. She would appear in several other films in the 80's in which she herself was the star (Best Little Whorehouse In Texas, Rhinestone, A Smoky Mt. Christmas) and one of the Southern gals in the popular women's film ""Steel Magnolias"" in '89. They don't make comedies like this anymore and this one is a charming one. Don't you wish you could take revenge on any boss who ever treated you this way ? This is a wonderful comic film and one that continues to delight even today. A real winner!",9 to 5

""9 to 5"" stars that lovable country lady Dolly Parton as she stars in this funny yet sweet office humor movie before we had crazy guys beat a printer with bats in a field or have an overweight guy take to a monitor with a keyboard.Dolly Parton was the national treasure - she had flair, fun, great country music (especially the ""9 to 5"" theme song), and has more wardrobe than a Neiman Marcus and Sanger Harris combined!!!!! Also, I am writing this to tell you that the Old School Disney Channel showed this late one night (Feb-Mar 1995), which makes her ""ANNA INDIANA"" (ewwww!!!!!) appearance the second on the network.If you like laughter in the office, then you better be watching this NOW!!!!! 10/10",9 to 5
41,roghache,Three secretaries' fun revenge on their chauvinistic boss,6,17 March 2006,"This is a cute, fun movie where three very different secretaries extract, most humorously, a gruesome revenge on the inconsiderate, chauvinistic boss who treats them abysmally. Nothing serious, just laughs, other than a (humorous) memorial to women's struggles in the workplace.The three secretaries are quite diverse, but share a common desire to give that sexist, egotistical boss, Frank Hart, his comeuppance. Jane Fonda convincingly plays Judy, a recently divorced housewife, who is just now timidly venturing forth into the corporate world. Lily Tomlin shines as Violet (not shrinking), the smart but put upon, unappreciated supervisor who shows Judy the ropes, and Dolly Parton (my perennial favorite) is the sweet, well endowed Southern gal, Doralee, who is assumed by many to be sleeping her way to the top.The plot moves along ridiculously from one set of crazy antics to the next, both fantasies and actual revenge tactics. My favorite scene is the one where the intimidated Judy must do battle with the photocopy machine, which of course has a mind of its own. I totally identified, being quite nontechnically minded myself. Of course it's also pretty funny when Violet thinks she's inadvertently murdered Hart by poisoning his coffee with rat poison. I seem to recall that at one point the ladies have Hart all trussed up.It's not memorable or rocket science but kinda fun. As one reviewer noted, check your brain at the door. The lasting legacy of the film is, however, Dolly's cute and catchy tune of the same name.",9 to 5
42,steiner-sam,"Dated, but fun",7,3 June 2021,"The film is focused on the conflict between female office workers and a hyper-sexist boss.Judy (Jane Fonda) gets a secretarial job after her husband left her for his secretary. Violet (Lily Tomlin) is the office manager who trains Judy and actually runs the division. Doralee (Dolly Parton) is the personal secretary of Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman), the sexist vice-president who steals Violet's ideas, spreads the rumor that he's sleeping with Doralee, treats staff arbitrarily, embezzles from the company, and constantly refers to his staff as ""girls.""There is a lot of broad comedy in the film (a runaway Xerox machine, a trick chair in Franklin Hart's office, mistaking rat poison for coffee whitener, stealing the wrong corpse from a hospital, kidnapping Franklin Hart in his own house, etc.)It's dated but fun, something you might watch again on TV if it's on. Jane Fonda in a comedic role is somewhat unusual, particularly playing a helpless, always-wanting-to-be-proper secretary against the more explicitly feminist Lily Tomlin. Dolly Parton pretty much plays Dolly Parton.",9 to 5

44,Thrashman88,Hilarious Comedy Stands The Test Of Time,9,8 January 2006,"I never saw 9 TO 5 when it played in the theaters but saw it soon after on video. I was like 14 years old back then and I remember enjoying the film very much, even if I didn't get all the misogynistic humor and women's lib stuff. Fast forward to 2006 and I decided to buy 9 TO 5 on DVD and see the fun again. After all, I haven't seen this one on TV in a LONG time and my local BLOCKBUSTER is sorely lacking a ""classics"" catalog. I knew in my mind that some of the movies you hold so dearly when you're a kid simply don't ""cut it"" when you see them all grown up. I am very pleased to say that 9 TO 5 has stood the test of time quite well and its ""it's a corporate world"" underpinnings couldn't be more appropriate now a days. The movie was cleverly written and directed and the humor develops naturally without looking forced or too acted out. It's the story of recently divorced Judy Bernly (Jane Fonda). Her ex husband ran away with his secretary and now Judy, ironically, finds a job being one. The company is called Consolidated Companies, which by the way, we never really know what they do or what they sell. We only know that it is a big company and that each floor of the high building is a ""division"". Frank Hart (played wonderfully by Dabney Coleman) is the villainous boss and head of the division. He is, as his right hand aide might put it, an ""egotistical bigot"". Hart's overwhelming tyranny makes his aide, Violet, to snap and with her go Judy and Dorlee (Dolly Parton), his voluptuous personal secretary. The trio spend the afternoon together drinking and smoking pot and jokingly thinking how each of them would ""kill"" their boss if they had the chance. The movie visualizes each of the secretary's outlandish fantasies and this part of the movie is one of the most entertaining and hilarious. Next day it's back to the real world and back to the daily grind. From here on each of the secretaries' fantasies take real form in some way or another making the movie even more fun. You'll have to see the rest to know what I mean. Despite being a 25 year old movie, 9 TO 5 stands the test of time perfectly, with only some of the cars and some of the clothing fashion looking a bit dated. It is a very well made, fast paced comedy that never bores. My wife loved it and she had never seen it before (she was barely a year when this came out!). 9* out of 10!!!",9 to 5
45,Pookyiscute,One of the best films of all time,10,22 January 2006,"I don't think I will ever get tired of watching this film. It's a movie that will remain a classic for a long time. Dolly Parton, Jane Fonda, Dabney Coleman and Lily Tomlin were made to play each of the characters in the film, and the film itself is so funny, it's hard to believe after all these years and times of seeing it, that it can still make me genuinely laugh.Judy (Fonda), has just gotten a job as a secretary at an office in the big city. She's in the middle of a divorce, because her husband ran off with a secretary. Violet (Tomlin), is in charge of the section that Judy will be working in, and becomes her new friend, showing her the ropes on her first day of work. Doralee (Parton), is the boss' secretary, and there's a rumor going around that the two of them are having an affair, even though they are both married. And finally, Mr. Hart (Coleman), is the boss of the whole division in which all of these girls work. He is a ""sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot"", if I may quote the girls. The movie is set up as so. Later on, chaos begins with a single cup of coffee, and the rest turns into a laugh-a-minute riot. Some people might find the humor a bit dated, or unrealistic, but I still find it funny. It's clever, honest and probably a chick-flick, but genuinely entertaining.I own the film, and hope that many of you will see it if you haven't already. It's a classic, and will remain that way for many years to come in my opinion.",9 to 5
46,pkzeewiz,A classic comedy that has a few good laughs.,4,10 January 2010,"I have watched this movie a few times and never really thought it was that funny, but it's still fun to watch and good for a few laughs.Its about women that work at a company and their boss is a jerk and they end up giving him a taste of his own medicine, and try to get the respect they deserve.The acting is really good. Dabney Coleman is one of those 80's stars that plays a good bad guy, not really evil, just unlikeable. Dolly Partin is lovable and fun to watch in comedies and her down south wit really shines here. Jane Fonda is so-so and does little for me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing about this movie, she has the funniest lines and made me laugh out loud several times, gotta love her.I could recommend this to anyone that likes 80's comedy. I like the movie but it has things about it that I don't like. It starts off great and has a nice flow and then everything starts coming together all at once and made me care less about the characters. They all have little fantasies about what they would like to do the boss and although 'cute' I just thought it slowed down the flow of the movie. As the movie goes on it once again picks up and the funniest things happen and then once again it slows down, only to wrap up in a quick manner thats too good to be true.4 out of 10 stars, but give it a try if you haven't seen it. I think depending on ones mood it may be more or less likable.",9 to 5
47,kyle-cruse,"Wow, now this is funny!",8,1 June 2009,"""9 to 5"" has become somewhat of a classic comedy for no other reason than the fact that it has some of the biggest laughs I've ever seen. It proves to be a fast-moving, quick-witted movie that keeps you engaged with laughs the whole time. It's a rather simplistic story, involving three women who want to rebel against their sexist boss (Dabney Coleman, playing a role typical of him at this time). A series of mishaps leads them to think they've poisoned him, causing the women to steal a dead body which turns out not to be his. When he finds out about their plot, they must kidnap him to keep him from talking, and it's all pure fun from there to the end. Sure, it's ridiculous nonsense, but that's what makes it so enjoyable, and that's the way comedy was meant to be, in my opinion. It takes about half an hour to really get into the film, but once the action starts, you'll find yourself laughing like crazy. One thing I like about this film is that there are no unnecessary secondary plots that take away from the main story. Everything works together here for one purpose, and the film does not try to make a statement. The film exists just to make us laugh, something we rarely get to see anymore. Not perfect, but easily enjoyable fun.***1/2 out of ****",9 to 5

49,jbartelone,One Of The Great Comedies of the 80's!,10,2 February 2007,"9 to 5 is an outstanding film that works on so many levels because of the tremendously talented actors in their leading roles. Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Dolly Parton, are an absolute joy to watch as they become increasingly fed up with their ""Sexist, Egotistical, Lying, Hypocritical, Bigot,"" boss, played magnificently by Dabney Coleman.The actors hit all the right notes, which creates this gem of a film that remains appreciated to this day, and not just for its humorous elements. There are many serious issues of work place prejudice and discrimination that can make almost anyone think of a boss or a teacher that treated them like s**t! In this movie, REVENGE ON THE IMPOSSIBLE BOSS HAS NEVER BEEN FUNNIER!!!! Standout scenes include: The outrage that Violet expresses toward Mr. Hart when she loses a promotion to a man at the company who had 5 years less experience than she had. (And even trained!) Judy's first day on the job trying to work the Xerox machine! The ""Pot"" Party.Violet thinking she put rat poison in Mr. Hart's coffee! ""Well, I thought it was Skinny & Sweet.

50,stefstars,Fun Film,6,30 April 2021,"Very enjoyable film. The comedy is of it's time but nonetheless timeless. Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Dolly Parton are a dream team. You can tell they had a lot of fun making this film. They're like the original prototypes to the Powerpuff Girls, Jane Fonda is Blossom, Dolly Parton is Bubbles, and Lily Tomlin is Buttercup. Prior to the pot smoking scene, the film is pretty strong and is at a 7 star rating but after that it takes a whacky turn. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the film, but I felt it was a completely different direction from where it was going in the first half of the film. It felt like there were different writers and that's where all the random moments came from. Personally, I could've done without the fantasy sequences but I suppose that marks the step away from the initial direction the film was taking.In terms of acting, everyone is great except Dolly Parton. Don't get me wrong, I love Dolly Parton and she works well with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin. It's just that she was Dolly Parton the entire film and not a character. I suppose the positives is she balances out Jane Fonda's panicky self in the rat poison confusion scene, although it'd make more sense that she react to the situation. I love Dolly Parton so never any hate to her, just learned that acting isn't her strength but even so I still loved her presence in the film. Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda are fantastic together, I can see that this was this was the inspo for bringing them back together in Grace and Frankie - where they basically sort of reprised their roles from this film. They both match each other perfectly, especially comedically.This is a film I'd definitely watch again. It's a classic comedy with a relevant message that's still true to this day. There are still many Franklin Hart Jr's. Out there and here's hoping more ladies get to have their revenge on them.",9 to 5

But the excitement didn't stop at the opening: once it came out, word-of-mouth for this film packed theaters across the USA, even in the Southern USA. The public spoke with their wallets: they LOVED this movie.30 years later, the film stands up to the test of time. This movie is not only still hilarious, with all the jokes still making for side-splitting moments, the commentary on what a quality work environment is, and the need for rights for women in the workplace, is still utterly valid.A film that deserves the term ""classic"".",9 to 5

55,2001ASOfan,"Sadly, ""9 to 5"" is still relevant!",10,14 July 2017,"Here it is 2017, 37 years after this film was made, and, while seeing a revival this week in a local multiplex was a mostly joyous, hilarious experience (all four leads and the script are terrifically funny, and the film holds up truly well), I was reminded that men like Dabney Coleman's character are very much alive and just as prevalent in modern day--nothing much has changed in the business (or political) world in those 37 years. That part was depressing. But since laughter truly is the best medicine, ""9 to 5"" is one way to deal with the insanity in a healthy way, and remind viewers that sometimes you have to fight back on the same level of nastiness that the perpetrator puts out! Here the purge of the women's frustration is outlined in some hilariously over-the-top healthy fantasies--marijuana-driven scenes that have Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton, and Jane Fonda dreaming of how they'd rid their lives of an evil, despicable boss, with none of them seriously thinking they would actually get their revenge in such violent (and very, very funny) ways. However, a case of mistaken-packaging-identity has them thinking they may have actually put their boss' demise in motion. It all plays out in an upbeat and, again, hilarious way, and it made me realize there aren't that many truly funny adult-themed PG-ish rated comedies made these days. I miss 'em! I loved all three women, and their eventual camaraderie is truly energizing and fun to be a part of, and Dabney Coleman makes a great evil boss. I still have some of Dolly's zingers ringing in my head days after viewing, particularly one about how Coleman's character needs to be taken down by some hired rustlers--her combination of innocence and fire is one of the reasons her popularity remains strong 37 years later!",9 to 5

When he gets free, he doesn't have a chance to reinstate his policies, because his corporate boss reassigns him to establish a branch in Brazil, as a reward for his office increasing their productivity over the last month or so. It is said that eventually he was kidnaped by a tribe of Amazon women.......... Before this, after Lily and Dolly have the courage to sternly tell off Hart for something he did or said that really pissed them off, the 3 leave work early to retire to a bar and then to one of their apartments, where they express their fantasies of what they would like to do to Hart, if there were no consequences............ Then, much time is spent on an incident in which Lily thinks she accidentally put poison, instead of sugar, in Mr. Hart's coffee, thus presumably causing him to keel over in his office, and being sent to the hospital. She doesn't know that he flipped over in his chair from leaning back too far, never getting a chance to taste his coffee. Thus, the 3 women rush to the hospital, where they see a body, under a sheet, being wheeled out of the room he's supposed to be in, not knowing that he has just recently been discharged. They are afraid that the autopsy report will show that he was poisoned. Thus, they steal the body, putting it in the trunk of their car, and drive off to dispose of it(where?). Eventually, they come to realize that they have another body. Now, they have to figure out how to return it, without being detected. Fun!. ........ The popular title song, sung by Dolly, is again sung during the closing credits.. Incidentally, Dolly sure filled out her blouses!!.............. Sixteen years later, the second film I'm aware of with a basically similar format was released, as ""The First Wives Club"". This time, the 3 women were angry that their husbands had dumped them for a younger substitute. Then, in 2014, the third film I'm aware of with the same basic format was released, as ""The Other Woman"", in which the wife of a middle-aged husband bonds with 2 women he has been cheating with, to punish him. Each of these comedies was popular at their onset, and remain popular, at least, with women, although there are also a fair number of low scores accompanying reviews.(presumably authored by guilty men). I claim to be an innocent man, hence don't hesitate to give these films a high score............Of the 3 films, this film has the highest mean rating at this site, and the fewest 1 or 2 ratings, from what I have seen.

59,dennis_chiu1,A Great Film for Its Time and Anytime,10,18 May 2009,"As a historical satire, 9 to 5 is in line of business all by itself. To understand the social importance of the film, you need a basic understanding of the history of the feminist movement.HISTORY OF SEXISM IN 1970S (from Wikipedia)1976 * Congresswoman Barbara Jordan of Texas, the first black woman elected to the U.S. Congress from the former Confederate States of America, is the first black and first woman to address the convention as a keynote speaker, famously declaring that what was different and special about that night was that ""I, Barbara Jordan, am a keynote speaker"".* Redbook magazine polls about sexual harassment and finds 90% of young women view the situation as serious.* ERAmerica is launched to promote the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.* Supreme Court decision agrees with General Electric that the company's failure to cover pregnancy-related disability is not discriminatory.* Many professional and women's organizations decide to boycott those states that have not passed the ERA and to hold their conferences elsewhere; the pressure is on for states to ratify the amendment before the 1979 deadline.1977 * New First Lady Rosalynn Smith Carter takes an active role in government, heading policy proposals and sitting in on cabinet meetings, as more women serve in White House staff positions and in the U.S. Cabinet than ever before.* The First National Women's Conference is held in Houston, Texas. Twenty-thousand representatives, women from all states, gather to pass a far-reaching National Plan of Action.* The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence is established.* Eleanor Smeal, president of NOW, demands that homemakers should have their own Social Security accounts.* The American Civil Liberties Union asks the Rhode Island Supreme Court to allow women to use their own names, rather than that of their husbands.* The first women pilots of the United States Air Force graduate.1978 * For the first time in the history of the United States, more women than men enter college.* The Oregon v. Rideout decision leads to many states allowing prosecution for marital and cohabitation rape. [15]* The Pregnancy Discrimination Act bans employment discrimination against pregnant women, stating a woman cannot be fired or denied a job or a promotion because she is or may become pregnant, nor can she be forced to take a pregnancy leave if she is willing and able to work.* ERA's deadline arrives with the ERA still three state short of ratification; Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman leads a successful bill to extend the ERA's deadline to 1982.9 to 5 - A MOVIE OF ITS TIMEWith the failure to ratify the ERA by three states, many women were extremely angry at the failure to achieve full recognition in a Constitutional Amendment. 9 TO 5 captures in social satire the anger of women at disparate treatment for hundreds of years as the time for the ERA bill was winding down on an extension to ratify it into the US Constitution.From sexual harassment of Dolly Parton's character by Dabney Coleman's character to taking credit for Lily Tomlin's file color coding and her passing up of a promotion, demonstrate the equity in a profoundly male managed workforce. Another sign of the times was working men cheating on their housewives with their secretaries, like what happened to Jane Fonda's characters.Dabney Coleman's character stating that he would not be out smarted by a bunch of ""dumb broads"" was a common sentiment among sexists that prevented women from advancing.Utilizing comedy to discuss these issues brought them to life in a film that endures.GREAT STORY & SCREENPLAYThe screenplay crackles with wit and slap stick gags. The rigging system built to detain Dabney Coleman's ""Hart"" character is a hilarious bondage Tour De Force. The coffee sweetener named ""Sweet & Slim"" (a metaphor for what women are expected to be in a sexist society ) and its counterpart rat poison are an example of witty gags that overflow from each reel of film. Other examples are scenes where Hart is trapped at home watching soap operas like housewives.One of the most satisfying portions of the film are the pot induced fantasies involving revenge against Hart. The physical comedy during these scenes are top notch, including Jane Fonda's Judy character shooting at Hart like a carnival game, Dolly Parton's Doralee character roping Hart like he was cattle, and Lily Tomlin's masterful dark portrayal as a ""Snow White"" like women, surrounded by animated forest animals, playing the role of poisoning Hart.The world has turned upside down in 9 To 5 by the end of the film. Due to the three lead women's progressive ideas, including daycare, job sharing, personalizing the office, and implementing other progressive work programs that increase productivity 20% in just six weeks.CONCLUSIONAlong with great performances, a hip hit song, and all of the social messages to boot, 9 To 5 is a cinematic triumph, and what more films should aspire to.",9 to 5

Hart, played by Dabney Coleman, does the same thing when he begins to look ridiculous after he is captured by the three female employees who literally tie him up. Marian (?) Mercer portrays the very naive and not-so-bright wife of Hart whom Hart hates. Sterling Hayden does a great turn as the large, stalwart chairman of the board.While a comedy, it does address a very serious situation about sexist bosses who carry on ugly affairs with female employees.

62,Percivalx,Women in the working world get their revenge!,10,5 November 2005,"Every time I watch this movie and I begin to hear Dolly Parton's Nine to Five song playing in the opening credits, I begin to smile. The reason is I know I'll spend the next 110 minutes laughing my head off. The female-empowerment message it tries to convey is rather dated but it is witty and amusing nonetheless. The movie takes place in the male-driven corporate world where women are still oppressed. Three office secretaries are fed up with their chauvinistic boss and after a silly set of occurrences they take matters into their own hands. The result is one of the funniest revenge comedies I've ever seen. What makes this movie work so well is the three leads. They are all perfectly cast and have delightful chemistry together. Jane Fonda plays prim, newly divorced Judy Bernly, Lily Tomlin plays feisty, pot-smoking Violet Newstead, and Dolly Parton plays sexy blonde Doralee Rhodes. Dabney Coleman is also terrific as the ""sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot"" who gets his just desserts in more ways than one.

I was a little pessimistic at first and thought the movie would be ok at best and Dolly Parton would be atrocious but it was quite the opposite. Although Dolly was pretty much playing herself she was very easy to watch and put on a pretty solid performance. Jane Fonda was equally as solid in her role too but it was the lesser known Lily Tomlin that for me stole the show and stood out the most.

When you've got the Boss from Hell, then this movie is your fantasy. I feel like I'm getting revenge on my boss from the comfort of my own home!Parton, Fonda and Tomlin make a fantastic team. There is obviously an incredible chemistry at work between them. Along with Dabney Coleman they play their fantastic characters to the hilt, right up to the edge of ""over the top"" without actually jumping off. At the same time the dramatic moments in the film fire up their (and our) sense of outrage at the conditions they must work under, giving the story a kick along at exactly the right moments.Apart from being horrendously funny, it is a stark reminder of what sort of conditions prevail in a workplace without a union to represent staff. I've been working for 14 years now and spent many years as a trade union delegate in my workplace. So much has been gained in the last 20 years that it is now not uncommon to encounter young, naive employees with no idea of history, asking ""So, why should I join the union? What's the union ever done?"". Look at this movie, look beneath the comedy, and see exactly what a workplace can be like without a union.",9 to 5
65,misslv80,Cheesy 80s fun!,8,18 August 2004,"""Nine To Five"" is one of those classic 80s comedies which was what made the decade so fun as far as movies go. Jane Fonda plays Judy, a recently divorced housewife who lands a secretarial job at a corporate office. Lily Tomlin is Violet, the beleagured supervisor at the office who shows Judy the ropes on her disasterous first day. Dolly Parton is Doralee, a secretary whom everyone at the office thinks is using her - ahem - ""assets"" to get ahead by sleeping with the boss.Soon these three become best friends and team up after they've gotten fed up with their chauvinistic and smarmy boss Mr. Hart, played to the hilt by Dabney Coleman. Sure, it does delve into zany corniness, such as the scene where they all get high on pot and share their fantasies about how each of them would like to knock off the boss (the funniest is Violet's ""Snow White"" coffee one, which uses cartoon animation and live action) or the scene where Violet thinks she accidentally poisoned Mr. Hart's coffee with rat poison and tries to steal his supposed dead corpse out of the hospital! This is the kind of movie where you check your brain at the door and take it for what it is.There are some great one-liners like the one where Fonda tells her ex-husband, who thinks she's having a kinky S&M affair with Mr. Hart, something along the lines of, ""If I want to do M&M's, that's fine with me!"" The office they work in is reminiscent of the one in ""The Apartment"". Three very clever characters, great comedic acting from Parton as Doralee and Tomlin as Violet. Jane Fonda, who I never cared much for, was good as the naive Judy. Sterling Hayden has a great cameo at the end as the ""Chairman of the Board"". A funny revenge comedy about Every Office, U.S.A.. You gotta love the theme song, too. Most recommended!",9 to 5

67,redwing1499,One of the best movies ever! In my Top 10,10,19 April 2006,"This is one of the funniest comedies ever next to Caddyshack and Friday. The cast has great chemistry and the way they torture their boss is hysterical. Anybody who has worked in an office can relate to the story. I think we've all had a boss like Hart. Nowadays, he would probably be sued for sexual harassment and fired, but it was tolerated back in the day. I was only 2 when the film came out but I found it on video as a teen and now own the special edition DVD. The best parts are the chemistry between the 3 ladies. Lily Tomlin (who i adore) is a standout as Violet and Dolly Parton does a fine job in her first movie ever. I dare you not to laugh!",9 to 5

It has a great cast all round, great story, great characters, great everything really. Modern feminists should take notes that a female centric movie can have a male antagonist because they're an simple antagonistic and not just for being a man. The movie also has a very comforting feel to it.Overall, great comedy with a stellar cast and story. Definitely a recommendation for a movie after work.",9 to 5
69,acheapmom,Fun film of Women who can Think Way Above their Pay Grade!!!,8,3 February 2009,"What do these 3 films have in common?1981 - Nine to Five - the film with three super secretaries who think WAY outside the BOX and make their company and workplace better???And--- 1988 - Working Girl (and the early 1990s ""Shining Through"")?They all are about a women (or Women) secretaries who push through to a higher level to PROVE to the men in power that they can think and work WAY above their pay grade.But don't worry about creaky preachy feminism. All three films are great fun! And all three films are somewhat underrated...(I suspect because very young girls - and many men - maybe just don't ""get"" why lots of women from the workplace - like these films).For me, I am reliving my time in the workforce as one of the pink collar workers who can work and think above her pay grade - as long as I do not expect to be paid at the higher pay grade level.If you're a boss---think out of the box here. Who are the real worker bees - the real persons who get things done in your company?(Who is really MISSED when he/she is on vacation???) I suspect you will find that a few of those ""indispensables"" might be the secretary - that clerk - that other ""nobody"" who is moving, working, thinking at a higher pay level.SMART bosses figure out who the Lily Tomlin leaders are - and reward them!",9 to 5

The music is great and the story, about female secretaries standing up to a male chauvenist pig of a boss who sees them as sex objects and takes credit for their work, is awesome. The women are incredibly funny and so is Dabney Coleman as their jerk of a boss. There's even a super fun Snow White song spoof where cartoon birds chirp and fly around as Lily Tomlin sings.",9 to 5

Jane Fonda and the brilliant Lilly Tomlin round out the lead cast with hilarious performances in this screwball revenge comedies that was one of the first films to champion ""girl power"". Even the smaller characters like Marien Mercer (as Missy Hart)and Elizabeth Wilson (as office snitch/bitch Roz)get in good one liners and laughs. Rent this movie. No wait - BUY this movie.

This is one of those films that never gets old. The jokes and situations are just as funny now as they were 20 years ago.

74,Genevieve_Patrick,Unsurpassed.,9,17 September 2009,"I am a 31 year old man, married to a high-powered corporate secretary. Her favorite film is Nine to Five. I never understood this until the past year. It NAILS what is STILL going on to our women in the workplace. Lily Tomlin is absolutely perfect in her role as Violet, and she is really at the heart of the movie. Her struggle is that of almost any honest, hard-working mid-level manager. This is not feminist propaganda by any stretch -- in fact I am extremely impressed by the humor with which this movie is pulled off. Dolly Parton is so awesome, so hilarious. Dabney Coleman embodies pure sleaze, and although it pains me to say this, many ""executives"" here in 2005 are almost identical to him. Obviously he is a ridiculous chauvinist bastard, but so are thousands of these guys in corporate America (and elsewhere) -- and they do it with impunity and without a sense of humor. Thank God for Nine to Five!",9 to 5

But it's true. For me the 80's was a fantastic decade for film and 9 to 5 certainly ranks up there as a hilarious comedy with a clever plot and great characters , which makes the time fly. However, I do wonder if 9-5 will survive the test of time as I have a horrible feeling that eventually it will be re-made with the female Ghostbusters cast and with Dwayne Johnson Franklin J Hart.",9 to 5

This is Dabney Coleman's greatest role and Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda have a field day. It is also unintentionally funny as it pre-dates the age of the PC and a couple of other major workplace changes but never fear it has plenty of copier humor to spare.",9 to 5
78,subjectivecuriosities,Mowie Wowie,9,8 February 2021,"Put down Karl Marx's Das Kapital & pick up this rated PG movie about women getting high & taking patriarchal capitalism hostage. The film starts off with Dolly Parton's super hit '9 to 5' Before introducing the main characters. Judy (Jane Fonda), Violet (Lily Tomlin), and Doralee (Dolly Parton in her acting debut) all work for the ""sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot"" Boss Mr. Hart (Dabney Coleman). This is perfect casting. By far my favorite part of the film is after toking on some 'mowie wowie' at Doralee's house each of the women share their fantasies of executing their boss. Judy goes first, imagining herself (in black & white) hunting Mr. Hart in his office while a mob of coworkers searches for him outside. She shoots him & puts his head on the wall like a big game trophy. Next Doralee imagines a western aesthetic where she subjects the boss to the same type of humiliations she endured. He flees the office & she hog ties him, to no ones objection, & leaves him spit roasting over a fire pit. The best is saved for last, Violet imagines everything like a disney film, where there is a mix of live action & animation. With the help of cartoon animals she puts poison in the boss' coffee. After Mr. Hart drinks the coffee steam comes out of his ears & his head spins around. Then with further help from her cartoon friends Violet pulls a lever sending Mr. hart out the skyscraper window. Her coworkers shown working chained in the lower level of a castle are given their freedom & rejoice while all 3 women smile & wave dressed like princesses. The women don't kill their boss but after a series of mistakes they have no choice but to kidnap Mr. Hart & run the office themselves. As an added bonus Ronald Reagan was fussy enough about the weed smoking scene to write in his diary on February 14th 1981 ""...they had to get stoned on pot. It was an endorsement of Pot smoking for any young person who sees the picture."" I love this film so much I included it on the Subjective Curiosities Podcast.",9 to 5
79,mahkiesl,"Fun, fun, fun",10,3 July 2005,"Sadly enough, I have to admit, I can practically recite this movie line, by line as I watch it. To me, its the perfect lazy day movie. It is a sad, but true, sign of the time the movie that was released. it shows three of the ways that women were (and sometimes still are!!) mistreated in the work place, and in Judy's case, life. Lily Tomlin is at her comical best in this movie Jane Fonda plays the shrunk, but unshrinking flower brilliantly.Dolly Pardon, in her first movie performance, has a few bad acting moments, but for the most part recovers and stays within her range, and pulls it off wonderfully.9 to 5 is just a fun movie. It doesn't try to be anything other than what it is, and sends a message at the same time: Women are smart, don't mess with them.",9 to 5
80,countrymusicfan1,Simply the best movie ever!!! A definite 10!,10,22 July 2002,"We knew Lily Tomlin was a great comedienne, but what is unexpected was Dolly Parton's natural comic genius.

A truly unique comedy that is timeless!",9 to 5
81,jaydf60,Chemistry,9,1 March 2005,"A battle between management and workers with a feminist twist is burdened only with a silly kidnapping the boss scenario that takes the majority of the film down a path only survived by the great, great, great chemistry of the three stars. Although the role of Judy is is written rather thinly Jane Fonda's acting is as good as it ever was, playing the mousy Judy with pitch perfection. Lily Tomlin a fantastic actress with an impeccable sense of timing (along the lines of TV greats Beatrice Arthur and Marion Lorne) plays Violet, who runs the office yet gets no power with great aplomb. And best is Dolly Parton as the office bombshell, plays her part with great charm and no-nonsense. Parton's first acting role (and has no training whatsoever) is superb, look at the scene in the hospital where Fonda is trying to calm Tomlin down, Dolly is so into the tension you think she will explode. Fonda, Tomlin and Parton's chemistry will not let you down. Nice supporting work from Dabney Coleman (boss), Peggy Pope (office lush), Marian Mercer (boss' slow wife) and the great Elizabeth Wilson as Roz the office stool pigeon. Always root for the underdog.",9 to 5
82,scrufffles,Excellent Movie,10,19 March 2005,"This is an excellent movie. Funny as hell, a bit twisted and psychedelic at times, and close to the reality of cubicle working. It shows the different personalities of people who come together working in an office environment. It is based in reality and how disenfranchising a job like this can feel, quite hopeless. The fantasies of the workers against their sexist, lying, hypocritical bigot of a boss are played out in playful talk. These dreams/fantasies are not to be missed and are quite surreal, that's one of the best parts of the movie. But then they actually do concoct a scheme to expose their boss' mishandling of company funds. It's a struggle to the end to out him until the ending where they don't have to do anything at all. The problem of their boss of taken care of for them in an unexpected and very fitting way.",9 to 5

I loved all of the performances. It's depressing that a lot of what they had to fight against is still happening in 2020 but it's a great reminder that there are smart, talented, ambitious people whose legacy we carry on by fighting for equality.
As a casual fan of Grace & Frankie it was really fun to watch Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin working together back in 1980.
Honestly, this movie has it all. Dolly's amazing songs, the comedic timing of Lily Tomlin, the Justice of Jane Fonda, friendship between women, getting revenge on a horrible tyrant of a man. If you think you are too good for this movie, think again, this movie is too good for you. I am on the Dolly train to Dollywood.",9 to 5
86,thetaylors604,"""9 to 5"" is still a great movie!",10,1 February 2019,"While much of ""9 to 5"" is dated -- after all, it was released in 1980 -- many issues depicted in the movie are still relevant. Relatively few companies have on-site day care or job-sharing. Sexual harassment still exists, even with prevention policies in place. Dedicated employees like Judy, Doralee, and Violet are still undervalued and underpaid. There are plenty of toxic bosses like Mr. Hart, and usually at least one Roz in every workplace. But there is much to be said about the close friendship that develops between ""the girls."" I highly recommend ""9 to 5"".",9 to 5
87,mhleta,This is NOT a PG movie,1,5 March 2005,"I give this a One-star rating because it's rated PG and absolutely should not be. I was 20 when this movie first came out and I enjoyed it as much as anyone. Twenty-five years later, there wasn't much I remembered about it except that I had thought it was funny and there was something about Lily Tomlin as a sadistic Snow White. So, since it was rated PG and it was in the bargain bin at the local video store, I bought it to watch with the kids(Ironically, ages 9 and 5). Let me first say, that I am no prude. But when it comes to my kids, I really don't want them exposed to certain things until they're ready. In this movie we have the 's' word numerous times. At one point Dabney Coleman tosses it around three times in under a minute. There is also heavy usage of some of the ""lesser"" swears, to the point where I was cringing every time another one came out. So, I paused it and packed the five year old off to bed, and resumed watching with my 9yo, with my hand firmly on the fast forward button. But still,I wasn't fast enough on the draw. There were references to ""sex games"" and S&M, or as Fonda puts it ""M&M's"". Funny, but not with the kids asking what it means. And finally, the scene I took most offense at being passed of as PG involved the three women sitting around sparking up a joint and having a fantastic time! What a fabulous message. Even worse, the joint was a gift from Tomlin's teenage son. So, watch the movie. It's got some funny stuff, but it sure as shinola is NOT a PG movie, so keep it away from the kiddies.",9 to 5

She's absolutely great and I love her laugh. 9 to 5 is so hilarious with great actors. Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin were so amazingly funny and I laughed myself to death when I watched this movie. I can only suggest everybody to watch this and watch also The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas, Steel Magnolias and Rhinestone. I will give whole 10 for this hilarious great little movie about working 9 to 5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah!",9 to 5

It shows you how offices how (and haven't in some cases) moved on over the years.My favourite part of the film is the title sequence and music at the beginning - although it seems half suitable for TV and half suitable for film, it ends up suiting the film perfectly in my opinion.It's a shame that Nine to Five isn't available on DVD in the UK either to rent or buy.

Very dated in it's theme (sexual harassment isn't mentioned ONCE; and the fact that everyone though that Doralee was 'screwing the boss'basically because of the way she looked like is never addressed) it still has enough 'timeless truth' to it to relate to modern audiences.Funny, funny, funny.""Well it looks just like 'Skinny and Sweet', except for the skull and cross bones on the label.""",9 to 5
91,richwash,A classic comedy!!,8,1 October 2015,"I work in an office setting. And office movies that were instant classics such as Horrible Bosses and Office Space are movies that I love watching. But the movie that started it all was 9 to 5. Even though the focal point is about three woman who turn the tables on their chauvinistic boss, it really is an enjoyable family comedy. My 12 year old son watched for the first time and love it!The three leading ladies and Dabney Coleman's Franklin Hart are the focal points in the film. Lily Tomlin, who is one of the most underrated improvisational actresses of all time was great as the unappreciated supervisor Violet Newstead. Listen to her one-liners in the film. They are so easily overlooked, but so funny. Jane Fonda's role as the recent divorcée Judy Burnly was the weakest of the three leading ladies, but still was effective. She plays a woman whose ex-husband left her for his secretary and getting a job was her way of not only supporting herself but also to move on from her previous life. But the one who really shines in this movie was Dolly Parton as Hart's secretary Doralee Rhodes. You can't really tell this was her first motion picture role. She provides so much energy yet she doesn't come off as being over the top. It's hard to forget that this was the second highest grossing film of 1980. Only ""The Empire Strikes Back"" did better. It is definitely a comedy classic and would go great in any DID collection!",9 to 5
