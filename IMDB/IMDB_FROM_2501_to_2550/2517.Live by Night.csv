0,bkoganbing,Making use of the killing trade,7,2 August 2017,"In a theme that goes back at least to James Cagney in The Roaring 20s, Ben Affleck plays a disillusioned war veteran who having seen the promises of a just world and peace not coming to fruition has decided since he's learned the trade of killing decides to make use of it by becoming a criminal. It's hard for Affleck who produced, directed, and stars in Live By Night as he is the son of a police chief in Boston.He gets caught up in a turf war between rival gangsters Remo Girone and Robert Glenister after a narrow escape from death and a prison term goes to work for Girone who asks him to organize in Florida and he chooses Tampa as his base. Affleck has to deal with other gangsters, the Ku Klux Klan, and holy roller revivalists and in the end there's one big shootout with his crew and his former Boston associates.Three women have prominent roles here, Elle Fanning who was degraded in Hollywood and then becomes an Aimee Semple McPherson revivalist, Zoe Saldana daughter of a local Cuban rum importer who with Affleck breaks all kinds of racist taboos in Dixie Florida when she gets involved with him, and Sienna Miller who was originally involved with both Affleck and Glenister at the same time.The ambiance of both 20s Boston and 20s/30s Tampa is well done here. Affleck also gets good performances out of his entire ensemble and take note of Chris Cooper as a redneck sheriff and Fanning's father, Cooper's brother-in-law is Matthew Maher whose bigotry as both the local Klan Kleagle is frightening and repellent, Chris Messina as Affleck's right hand guy, and Max Casella as the mutt son of Girone who has it in for Affleck. What he lacks in brains he makes up for in bile.Director Affleck also got actor Affleck to give a great performance in the lead. Live By Night is an old fashioned gangster flick with some current themes.",Live by Night
1,Leofwine_draca,Very nice gangster effort,7,6 October 2019,"LIVE BY NIGHT is a tour-de-force gangster epic from Ben Affleck, set in 1920s Florida where rival gangsters seem to spend the whole running time plotting against each other and striving to win control of their turf. It's a lively, well-paced effort, directed very nicely by Affleck himself, who also bags the main role. The film reminded me of BOARDWALK EMPIRE particularly, which may have been the intent, and has the same quality of cinematography and feel. There are action scenes sprinkled liberally throughout and they're immersive and impressive, particularly a wonderfully old-fashioned car chase. The supporting cast is dotted with familiar character actors giving solid performances and overall there's very little to dislike about this one.",Live by Night
2,SnoopyStyle,story too big and Affleck too cold,5,15 October 2017,"Joe Coughlin (Ben Affleck) returns from the Great War and leads a robbery crew in Boston. His girlfriend Emma Gould is the inside man who is also the mistress to Irish gangster Albert White. A gang war between White and Italian mob boss Maso Pescatore blows up. He gets set up by White, beaten, and imprisoned. After his release, Pescatore recruits him to chase after White who has escaped to set up an operation in Tampa, Florida. With his best friend Dion Bartolo by his side, he builds a rum operation in Tampa. He befriends Sheriff Irving Figgis (Chris Cooper) and his daughter Loretta (Elle Fanning) who is heading to Hollywood. He marries local Graciela Corrales (Zoe Saldana). He battles the KKK and then tries to build a casino.This story seems to be too big for Affleck's writing skills. He's proved his directing skills but this is a long meandering criminal life. He's trying to make Godfather but he doesn't have the vision. It also doesn't help that he plays Joe in a cold and distant manner. He is so cold that none of his relationships are appealing. I don't care about Emma and only slightly more about Graciela. The saving grace is that he doesn't get romantic with Loretta as I feared. That may be why her character is more compelling than almost everybody else. This movie pushes Affleck to his limits and he shows his limitations.",Live by Night
3,nogodnomasters,Sleep by day,6,6 August 2017,"The film is a biography of a fictional character, Joseph Coughlin, which means Ben Affleck is on the screen in nearly every scene. Joe is the son of a Boston policeman (Brendan Gleeson) but lives as a criminal or ""outlaw"" as he dryly narrates because he thinks we can't see what is happening on the screen. Boston is divided between the Italians and the Irish during prohibition. Joseph wants to abscond with the girlfriend (Sienna Miller) of Irish boss Albert White (Robert Glenister). His plan fails and he eventually finds himself in Tampa, securing rum and opening clubs for the Italians, making new alliances and enemies.The film is like two films in one. The first part is Joseph in Boston and the second part is Joe in Tampa. Ben Affleck played a cold unemotional line reader, perhaps by design, but not very entertaining. It was interesting to watch all the pieces of the puzzle of illegal rum distribution come into place, but they could have created characters that were not so cardboard. Zoe Saldana plays a Black Cuban. Elle Fanning has a small role toward the end.Guide: F-word. Sex. No nudity",Live by Night
4,kosmasp,Day Dreaming,8,26 June 2017,"Not exactly of course. And if you want to get a high position in a criminal organization, you probably should never sleep, let anyone out of your eye sight and be strapped all the time. But this may make this sound a lot more action paced than it is. This actually takes a page (or more) from older crime movies, especially when it comes to its pacing and storytelling in general.That may not be everyone's case of course, so that will be up to you. Still you can't fault the movie for its quality and while it is not another ""Town"" (though that eventually happens too, no pun intended), this does move correctly into a different territory and shows off Ben Afflecks other qualities. A strong and stellar cast in a slow burning movie ... sounds good?",Live by Night
5,classicsoncall,"""You make your own luck sometimes. Sometimes. Sometimes it makes you.""",7,23 January 2020,"Somehow, Ben Affleck just doesn't strike me as the gangster type. Maybe he's just too good looking and debonair in that white suit to cut it as a mob guy. Still, the story is fairly interesting with it's share of rival gangs and pretty women to turn the heads of mobsters on the make. Where Joe Coughlin (Ben Affleck) runs afoul is by falling for gangster Albert White's girl (Sienna Miller), with the fallout from that liaison resulting in a severe beating and a three year prison stretch. As the son of a Boston cop, Joe doesn't take very well to the kind of life the law requires, and finds himself recruited by Italian mob boss Maso Pescatore (Remo Girone) to go against the Albert White (Robert Glenister) organization, which he's more than happy to do if it gets him his revenge.The story moves down South to Tampa, where Joe ingratiates himself with local rum runners Esteban (Miguel J. Pimentel) Suarez and sister Graciela (Zoe Saldana). By removing Klan leader RD Pruitt (Matthew Maher) from the picture, Coughlin has pretty much a free hand to take over the entire bootleg operation, but seemingly meets his match when the daughter of Tampa police chief Irving Figgis (Chris Cooper) returns from heroin detox and takes up religion. Joe's failure to deal constructively with Loretta Figgis (Elle Fanning), (in other words, he didn't kill her), earns him a black mark with Pescatore, and the internecine war that ensues leaves a lot of dead bodies in it's wake. I should mention that Coughlin gets reliable support from Boston crony Dion Bartolo (Chris Messina) as his second in command, and I like the way the story left it questionable about Loretta's suicide when Dion brought the sad news to Joe.Seen as a stand alone picture, this one's not bad for a gangster flick, but when you compare it along side the seminal films of the genre like ""The Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas"", you'll notice that it's a bit lacking. Still, Affleck does a decent job with all the heavy lifting here as actor, director and screenwriter, while managing to make it to the end of the story, handing over the reins of his crew to sidekick Dion in a somewhat surprising move. Not so for wife Graciela, who was inadvertently rubbed out by the 'repenting' Chief Figgis over the death of his daughter.I was curious about that film Joe took his young son to see, ""Riders of the Eastern Ridge"". By it's title, it sounded like it could have been a Tim Holt Western, and with the trio of lawmen who waved goodbye to each other, had the feel of a Three Mesquiteers flick. No such luck though, it's a movie that was never made, and you won't find it here on IMDb.",Live by Night
6,rmax304823,Demon Rum.,6,23 September 2017,"This neo-noir is written by, directed by, produced by, concocted by, and stars Ben Affleck. Music by Ben Affleck, with a harmonium solo by Ben Affleck. With additional dialog by Ben Affleck.Therefore, a lot of whatever appeal this film should have depends on Ben Affleck. And how does it turn out? Not too bad actually.It's 1920s in Boston. Affleck is an Irish bootlegger hired by the Italian gang to go down to Tampa and establish the booze and casino business in the face of anti-Yankee sentiments from the local hoods and corrupt law enforcement officers. He succeeds, more or less, taking a bullet along the way, until some intractable head of the mob back in Boston thinks he should be replaced, leading to one of several shootouts.In Tampa (or whatever it's called here -- Yboro City or something) he encounters insults about his Northernness and religion from the Ku Klux Klan, whom he wipes out with a swipe of his hand, helped immeasurably by his aide de camp, Remo Gerone. How does he take out, say, the Grand Imperial Wizard and Majestic Necromancer? Simple. In the middle of a discussion, seated across the desk from the snarling Southerner, he yanks out a .45 and puts a bullet into the Great Wazier's forehead.The friction between Affleck and the Klan doesn't last long. The friction between Affleck and the Cuban girl Zoe Saldana lasts a lot longer, which is perfectly understandable. She's a paragon of pulchritude and probably, beyond that, Affleck may want to learn to speak Spanish. There's another woman in the plot. Two, really, but let's concentrate on the second, Elle Fanning, because her role is important if brief. She's appalling young and beautiful, with nothing more than an impudent bump where her nose should be, but her cornflower blue eyes are the eyes of kewpie doll. She's so cute that I was ready to dismiss her out of hand as an actress. But she has one extended scene with Affleck in a café that puts her in the same rank as the rest of the cast.And Affleck? He's muscular and big. He's soft spoken, like Clint Eastwood, and a man of few words. In fact, his features look grim and chiseled. If Lawrence Tierney knew how to act and had just walked out of a Gestalt therapy class, he might look like and behave like Affleck. He delivers the goods but the role itself -- romantic noir hero -- is a tight suit that doesn't allow him much in the way of displaying his acting chops. As a director he gets the job done.And that harmonium solo? Pure virtuosity.",Live by Night
7,Quinoa1984,a stumble for a talented director as he miscasts his leading man,4,14 January 2017,"This was one of the major, crushing disappointments of the year and, if anything, this may be more of a misfire than Batman v Superman; at least with Zack Snyder, you know that it's a crap-shoot for it to be any good and the odds are not in one's favor (and, actually, Affleck was the best part of that movie, with terrific charisma and personality and anger built well for that character, poorly written as it was at times).But with Affleck he's shown with three directed feature films that he has a terrific control of tone, engaging and entertaining characters, stories that carry at least a modicum of moral complexity (Gone, Baby, Gone, which was my least favorite of those, seems to be leaps and bounds stronger than this when it comes to that), and some solid sense of humor and pathos (at least through Argo). He's shown skill and talent at crafting intense thrillers which, even if theirs whiffs of BS, they work as pure entertainments. Live by Night has none of this. I question what was going through his head when he got behind and in front of the camera.Another critic, I think on Birth-Movies-Death, said that this feels more like what one might expect a directorial debut to be like: a vanity project where its writer-director-producer-star is playing one of those seemingly amazing gangster bad-asses (oh, did I say gangster, sorry, his character doesn't want to be called a 'gangster' for some reason), while also being, at least eventually, a Great White Hope character because... movie. Reasons. But this is his fourth go-around. Did the success at the box office and Oscars go to his head? Was it (to get personal in area I have no right to, but screw it, this is my review) his split up from Jennifer Garner? Run-of-the-mill mid-life crisis? Whatever the case, Live by Night's director miscast its lead actor: himself! He barely seems like at times that he wants to be there, talking in a monotone through many of the scenes; if this was an intentional choice it's a miscalculation because he barely, if ever, gives any other indication of a personality to this guy, why he seems so appealing to the women in his life (Zoe Saldana especially, what does her character see in Coughlin?) and if it wasn't intentional, then clearly no one dared to approach the auteur of this production to say that he might want to do... something else with him. Adding to this Affleck's voice is constantly there in the sort of narration that isn't the powerful and insightful Scorsese kind for a multi-decade crime epic - this is the kind that describes what we're seeing on screen, or not necessary to describe that's going on.I might try to praise some of the other supporting actors as things that could elevate the material, but (with the exception of Elle Fanning, who is great, and Chris Cooper who has practically two or three scenes but makes them count for what he can) everyone is at the mercy of this exposition-laden script. Every so often you may get like that car chase through Boston with the 1920s-era cars, or that shoot-out at the end (which is exciting when you can see what's happening but it is edited too choppily, for my tastes anyway), but mostly Live by Night is characters talking in one room, and then another room, and then sitting down to do it again. It might be fine if it's interesting talk, but more often than not it isn't. Some hope comes with a conflict/threat to the characters goals in the form of a KKK moron (and the actor is decent too, I forget his name, as much as he's playing a cartoon character), but that too gets dashed. Most of the talent here is wasted because they don't have much room to develop any character past being types, or the script doesn't give them much to say that could be interesting.In other words, Affleck clearly wanted to take a more epic stab at Dennis Lehane - his debut was an adaptation of one of his detective series - and perhaps at the milieu that Boardwalk Empire mined so potently in the HBO series. Some of this could have been chalked up to simple adaptation-to-screen problems, which is fair, or to how there are simply higher standards for acting and writing by this point in 2017. And yet I found myself constantly, more than once, nodding off during this movie which should have had me glued to the screen.It shouldn't be too hard to pull this kind of material off, but Affleck fumbles it all through thinking he's oh-so-interesting on screen (he isn't), and it also doesn't help that, I suspect, he either didn't have final cut (wouldn't surprise me, it IS Warner brothers), or he got nervous about having a movie run longer an 130 minutes, so there's times character development or just...something... BETTER feels shorn off. I don't know if I've seen a major star sleepwalk through mediocre (if sometimes well-shot) material like this since After Earth.",Live by Night
8,writers_reign,Eastwood-Lite,6,20 January 2017,"As a triple-threat - writer-director-actor - Ben Affleck leaves something to be desired; Clint Eastwood. Although I have read and enjoyed several novels by Dennis Lehane (himself a native of the working-class suburb of Boston, Dorchester) I am not familiar with this one so I am unable to judge who is to blame for what is, for want of a better word, an insipid gangster film, and this despite a body count that feels like sixty or seventy. For reasons best known to himself Affleck has turned to the UK and called on the services of Robert Glennister (yet to give a bad or even mediocre performance in any genre) and Sienna Miller, an acting joke. It's a movie you can watch without boredom but forget before the end credits have unspooled.",Live by Night
9,zardoz-13,An Exceptional Gangster Epic of the Prohibition Era,9,23 January 2017,"Two-time Oscar-winning writer & director Ben Affleck of ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Argo"" has helmed an above-average, old-fashioned, Prohibition Era gangster epic ""Live by Night"" with himself as star that bears greater resemblance to Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in America"" (1984) with Robert De Niro than Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" (1972) with Marlon Brando. At the same time, Affleck has tampered with the violent, empire-building gangster film formula. Mind you, ""Live by Night"" isn't strictly traditional in its depiction of gangsters. Instead of machine gun massacres in the urban canyons of a northern metropolis, ""Live by Night"" stages machine gun massacres at luxury resort hotels amid the scenic splendor of rural southern Florida. Like the antihero that Affleck portrays with considerable style, charm, and restraint, ""Live by Night"" doesn't abide by all gangster movie rules, particularly the tragic ending. Nevertheless, crime still doesn't pay for the protagonist. As in most gangster movies, the mobsters count on avarice, treachery, blackmail, and betrayal to achieve their infamy. Affleck's armed and dangerous anti-hero, however, displays neither the aggressive pugnacity of Edward G. Robinson in ""Little Caesar"" (1931) nor does he behave like James Cagney's trigger-happy hoodlum in ""The Public Enemy"" (1931.) Instead, he imitates Robert De Niro's Jewish gangster David 'Noodles' Aaronson in the Leone masterpiece. Affleck's Irish-American hooligan Joe Coughlin knows when to say 'no' and abandon the business before his rivals riddle him with bullets to kingdom come. My only complaint—and it constitutes more of a quibble—is the 2 hours plus running time. This chronicle about a self-proclaimed 'outlaw' who ascends from the ranks of blue-collar, unaffiliated thieves and emerges as the white-collar chieftain of a mob-supervised, multi-million-dollar enterprise doesn't exactly lunge off the screen. Affleck allows things to develop gradually and steeps the logistics of crime in atmosphere galore as well as memorable characters. Strong villains make the best movies with their notorious skulduggery. Faithfully adapting the second novel in Dennis Lahane's Coughlin series, Affleck tangles with three unforgettable dastards. The son of an incorruptible Boston Police Deputy Superintendent, Joe Coughlin (Ben Affleck of ""The Town"") refuses to accommodate his father, Thomas Coughlin (Brendan Gleeson of ""Gangs of New York""), when it comes to being a law-abiding citizen. Joe survived the devastating trench warfare of World War I in France as a U.S. Marine while men around him perished by the dozens on the battlefield. He has come home to Boston with nothing but utter contempt for the politicians who sold out the troops at the international treaty negotiation. Joe vows never to take orders again. Things don't pan out exactly as our hero had anticipated. Initially, Joe and two masked accomplices knock over an illegal, high-stakes poker game with a paid-off insider, Emma Gould (Sienna Miller of ""American Sniper""), who knows her way around Boston. Eventually, one of Boston's most notorious gangsters, Albert White (Robert Glenister of ""Safe Conduct""), learns that Joe has been raiding his venues. White insists that our protagonist join his gang and use his skills for something more appropriate to his talents. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the jealous White, Joe has been sneaking around behind White's back with his mistress Emma. Mafia crime boss Maso Pescatore (Remo Girone of ""Angel with a Gun"") summons Joe and asks him to kill White. Adamantly, Joe refuses to attach himself to the Italians. Maso threatens to inform on Joe if he doesn't eliminate White. Meantime, Joe plans a big bank robbery so Emma and he can flee to California with some capital. The robbery goes sideways. Three policemen die trying to nab Joe and his accomplices. Eventually, White catches up with Joe after Emma betrays him. White brutally beats Joe up. He is poised to finish him off when Thomas Coughlin rolls up with the Boston Police in tow. Thomas arrests Joe, but he convinces a harsh judge prosecute his son on lesser charges since Joe's accomplices killed the cops. Furthermore, Thomas informs Joe that Emma died when her getaway car plunged into the river. Joe sweats out forty months behind bars in the Charlestown State Prison. After his release, Joe offers to work for the Pescatore family, and Maso dispatches him to Ybor City, Tampa, Florida, to handle their rum-running enterprise. No sooner has Joe set up shop than the evil White dispatches not only his own henchmen but also hooded KKK gunmen to make life miserable for our hero. Joe creates an enormously profitable operation for Maso. Nevertheless, he doesn't abandon his yearning to wreck vengeance on White for what he did not only to him but also Emma.""Foxcatcher"" production designer Jess Gonchor, ""Tree of Life"" costume designer Jacqueline West, and ""Forrest Gump"" set decorator Nancy Haigh has painstakingly recreated both the glory and the squalor of the Prohibition Era. The gangsters attire themselves lavishly in posh suits with fedora-style hats, while their dames doll themselves up with equal magnificence. The gangsters cruise around in vintage cars of the period, and their henchmen wield that indispensable weapon of the day: the .45-caliber, Thompson submachine gun with drum magazines rather than stick magazines. Indeed, Affleck has preserved virtually all the elements of the classic gangster movie during the Depression about illegal rum-runners. After fate cheats Joe with Emma's sudden death, he gets involved romantically with a gorgeous Cuban lady, Graciela Suarez (Zoe Saldana of ""Star Trek Beyond""), who participates in the business of selling illegal rum with her brother. ""Live by Night"" doesn't dwell only on the gangsters and their illicit business, but also in the lives of the supporting characters, particularly a young woman (Elle Fanning) who suffered from the adversity of heroin addiction and later becomes an evangelist to protest vice of any kind. The cast is superb, and nobody gives a bad performance. Despite its leisurely, slow-burn pace, ""Live by Night"" manages to present the exploits of gangsters in a setting and manner that few gangster movies have, especially with its lukewarm finale.",Live by Night
10,oscaralbert,This flick has flopped because Warner Bros.' warning hits too close to home . . .,8,18 January 2017,". . . for most Americans. Ben Affleck writes, directs, and portrays an obvious stand-in for White House Resident-Elect D.J. Rump. A ruthless casino builder, Affleck's ""Joe"" dumps his American-born sweetie for an exotic foreign-born Red Commie Cuban, makes deals with the Ku Klux Klan, and then defects to Cuba. Warner is warning America that Rump is just like Joe, with a private army and private jets at his disposal. As soon as Rump gets into hot water for his High Treason against the Sacred American Constitution, he doesn't need to rely on U.S. Military personnel and Air Force One to make his getaway. He also won't need his Puppetmaster, the new U.S. Czar and Red Commie KGB Strongman Vlad ""Mad Dog Putin"" to send an Aeroflat to pick him up. Rump can flee to Russia on his own jet flown by his hired mercenaries (if he's not already in the Kremlin receiving another round of marching orders at the time America has had enough). ""Heaven is here, right now, on U.S. soil,"" most of the main characters of LIVE BY NIGHT keep saying as it finishes up. By the time these people realize that they should NOT support Satan's Promises about Pie in the Sky, Warner has shown the danger posed to all of us by folks such as Putin's designated attorney general, one-time (and probably future) KKK imperial wizard Jeff Sessions. Jeff and the rest of Rump's Cabinet of Deplorables have been hand-picked by Putin to destroy their agency, and thus annihilate America. It would be easy to write a book or two about which LIVE BY NIGHT thug Warner is using to warn us against each of the Rump nominees. If this sounds like a challenging movie to watch for ""entertainment"" purposes, be content to Crowd Source Warner a dollar or two for at least attempting a public service which no other American movie studio is willing to undertake, at a reported loss north of $100 million.",Live by Night
11,FlashCallahan,Absolutely Hat-tastic......,6,15 January 2017,"Taking fatherly advice is not in Joe Coughlin's nature. Instead, he is a self-proclaimed outlaw, despite being the son of a Police Deputy Superintendent. Unlike the gangsters he refuses to work for, he has a sense of justice and an open heart, and both work against him, leaving him vulnerable time and again. Driven by a need to right the wrongs committed against him and those close to him, Joe heads down a risky path that goes against his upbringing and his own moral code. LLeaving the cold Boston winter behind, he and his crew turn up the heat in Tampa. And while revenge may taste sweeter than the molasses that infuses every drop of illegal rum he runs, Joe will learn that it comes at a price........Live By Night has had some very sniffy reviews, so obviously, my expectations were low when entering the cinema. But I like Affleck, he's made a wonderful choice in his career, because between the years of 2002-2004, it was almost career suicide, making bomb after bomb after bomb.While it's nothing brilliant, the film is solid enough to garner interest, and although the film is your slow burning type thriller, it's never boring.It's very reminiscent of Angel Heart, Heavens Prisoners, and a little of Last Man Standing, but Affleck gives the film an air of tension throughout, you just keep thinking that Joe will have a gun pointed to his head at any second.Aided with an amazing supporting cast, Affleck does give a decent performance, but heavyweights like Gleeson, Cooper, and even Miller, cast a shadow over his performance whenever they share the screen with him.There are two quite breathtaking set pieces, a car chase and a hotel shoot out are two wonderful bookending sequences between the meat of the film.Some of the camera work is beautiful, and two subplots involving the KKK, and Elle Fanning seem pointless to begin with, but just adds more to the film.So while it isn't fantastic, if you like prohibition era movies, and a plethora of hats, it's a lot better than so,e of the reviews say.",Live by Night
12,phd_travel,Weak story sinks this epic gangster saga,3,5 July 2017,"Someone ought to have told Ben Affleck this story wasn't movie material. It's boring and improbable. Should have been interesting, as an Irish kind of gangster embarks on a journey through the history of gangsters in this country. The story starts off in Boston then goes down to Tampa where he operates a bootlegging business and tries to start a casino. Along the way there are various attractive women in his life, a gangster's moll played by Sienna Miller, a Cuban woman he marries played by Zoe Saldana and a would be actress turned heroin addict turned evangelist played by Elle Fanning. The shootout is very doesn't ring plausible - the 2 big gangsters could have killed him before his gang rushed through the underground passage. The ending is just weak with that senseless death of his wife.There are a few good points. The production values are high with an interesting vintage car chase. The costumes and sets are evocative. The acting of Sienna Miller is quite good. Almost didn't recognize her with bad teeth and too much makeup - she is quite a convincing gangster's moll.

13,deloudelouvain,Better then the two first pages of reviews that I read,7,14 June 2017,After reading two pages of reviews I can only come to the conclusion that a lot of people are just bitter humans that can not enjoy a movie without having the need to think they would do it all better if it was up to them. Because seriously if you are going to rate this movie with one star then there must be something wrong with you and I really wonder what kind of movie you would rate as perfect. I won't say it's the best gangster movie ever but it is certainly not the worst either. It could have used a bit of more action but that's just a futility. If you like a bit of drama combined with a not bad gangster story then you should enjoy Live By Night. Ben Affleck might not be the best actor ever but he did a good job directing and playing in this movie. So for all the reviewers that rate this movie below three stars I would suggest you stop watching movies and go play some ping pong or something else instead.,Live by Night
14,Hellmant,I hope Affleck's next directorial effort is much closer in quality to his previous movies!,7,18 January 2017,"'LIVE BY NIGHT': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new crime drama from writer/co-producer/director Ben Affleck (who also stars in the movie). It's based on the 2012 novel (of the same name) by Dennis Lehane; who also wrote 'GONE BABY GONE' (which Affleck also directed the film adaptation of). Leonardo DiCaprio, who was originally supposed to star in the movie, also served as a co- producer on the film. The mob flick costars Elle Fanning, Sienna Miller, Zoe Saldana, Chris Messina, Brendan Gleeson and Chris Cooper. It tells the story of the son of a respected Boston police captain, and a World War I veteran, who becomes a notorious gangster (during the 1920s and 1930s). The film was originally expected to be another possible awards contender, for Affleck, but it hasn't received many overly positive reviews from critics. Despite being a fan of Affleck, as a director and an actor, I wasn't that impressed either.The story begins in Boston, during the 1920s. Joe Coughlin (Affleck) is a World War I veteran, who's now an Irish criminal. He's also the son of the Boston police captain (Gleeson), and having an affair with the mistress (Miller) of a powerful Irish gangster, named Albert White (Robert Glenister). Joe is nearly killed by White, and then arrested for the death of three police officers; during a crime he committed with his partner Dion Bartolo (Messina). After serving three years in prison, he goes back into a life of crime, in Florida. He continues to get himself into more trouble there, while also becoming a successful gangster himself. I've really enjoyed all three of Affleck's other directorial efforts ('THE TOWN', 'GONE BABY GONE' and 'ARGO'), so I definitely had high hopes for this; sadly it didn't live up to my expectations (and the reviews, and Box Office, have absolutely no effect on my opinion). The movie is beautifully shot, and Affleck did another excellent job directing the film; but his acting performance is definitely not one of his best. The other actors all give decent performances in the movie though, and there's some pretty cool actions scenes in it. The pacing is a little slow though, and I didn't really care at all about any of the characters. I hope Affleck's next directorial effort is much closer in quality to his previous movies!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/niTBUpMl3sQ",Live by Night

16,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Ambitious but slightly misfiring period flick,7,18 January 2017,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning After serving in World War 1, Joe Coughlin (Ben Affleck), the son of renowned policeman Sergeant Coughlin (Brendan Gleeson), is disillusioned and turns to crime to get by. He runs afoul of local crime boss Albert White (Robert Glenister) after having an affair with his moll, and things get even more out of hand when some policemen are killed during a chase after a liquor raid. Joe flees to Cuba, and in his battle to rise to the top, engages in a merciless battle of survival of the fittest.After the trail blazing successes of The Town and Argo, Ben Affleck has certainly taken his sweet time with his third acting/directing job, which has arrived in January on our shores, in a time usually taken up with Oscar contenders and films people kind of want to shoo out the way. Affleck has here turned his hand to a period piece, attempting to capture the style, culture and setting of the time, whilst setting it against a backdrop of the prohibition era crime lifestyle of the time. It's an ambitious project, which he obviously put his heart and soul into, but compared to his two aforementioned hits, it could be regarded as a failure.A seriously all star cast has been assembled to perform a sprawling saga that tries to show every last detail, but rather than being absorbing, the result is just messy and incoherent, with too many stories converging all at once, and too many characters to keep up with to be able to care about most of them. In the lead role, Affleck certainly has presence, strolling around in his zoot suit and capturing the flair and grace of such a character perfectly well. The supporting cast can't really be faulted either, especially Chris Cooper as a pious, heartbroken father, its just the muddled narrative they're following that lets them down.It's too well made and laboured over to be called bad, it's just compared to Affleck's other two acting/directing films, it's curiously sloppy and unfocused, overly sprawling without a solid foundation. With that in mind, you kind of admire it on its own terms but wonder what went wrong with it compared with what went before. ***",Live by Night
17,ThomasDrufke,"Repent, Repent, Repent",5,14 January 2017,"With Ben Affleck movies I come to expect a few things; entertaining story with some possible action sequences involved, a well strung piece encompassing plenty of emotions, a thought provoking message, and some great accents. When I see a movie's slogan saying ""Joe was once a good man"", I expect to see Joe begin as a ""good man"", right? Well, not all promises were kept with Live by Night.I'm not sure anyone has had a better start to their directing career than Affleck. Beginning with Gone Baby Gone (which I still think is his best work), The Town, and then the Best Picture winning Argo. The man had done no wrong up until this point. But it seems like once he was cast as Batman, his film career has taken a slight dip. Besides Gone Girl, I don't think any of the film's he's been a part of have been at the same level as any of the aforementioned films. With that said, he actually hasn't been the problem. It's just interesting that Live by Night, The Accountant, Suicide Squad, and Batman v Superman all have the same issue; a messy script with a tonally incoherent plot.But back to Live by Night, Affleck took his directing talents and brought them to the gangster genre, or at least sort of. It's not your prototypical gangster pick with a rise and fall, in fact, Joe doesn't really have a character arc at all. Joe claims the entire film to not be a gangster, and that he was once a good man. Not only do we not get to see any hint of a good man underneath the bright suits or hats. The one connective tissue in gangster films is that we see the human side to these horrific people and, as audience members, we get to decide if what they are doing is right or wrong. Whether it's in Dennis Lehane's novel or not, I would have preferred to see these characters in more human situations.Live by Night does have its fair share of great moments, though. The few human moments of the film come from Joe hanging with his crime partner, Dion, played by Chris Messina. Messina is clearly the highlight of the film, adding humor in a totally different way than his counterpart. The cast as a whole is a highlight, actually, but the writing isn't where it needs to be. I love Chris Cooper and I think Elle Fanning is one of the most impressive young actresses working, but I don't think either of them needed to be in the movie. They both contribute to the boring and slower parts to this gangster flick, sitting down and talking business. Aside from the cast, the film does have some of the best shootouts of the year, but hey so did The Accountant.After thinking about it for a few hours, there's more bad than good in Live by Night. Or rather, more messy storytelling than a coherent script. I wish I could say Affleck was 4 for 4, but 75% isn't so bad either. I still have faith Ben will make a great solo Batman film (if that ever happens) and a worthy remake of Witness for the Prosecution. Sadly, this just wasn't the film I was hoping for.+Performances+Solid action-The characters lack depth-Plenty of unnecessary and uninteresting story threads5.5/10",Live by Night

Nevertheless, he prefers the life of crime himself. He and his co-horts rob banks and poker games, upsetting his papa greatly. Love, however, remains strong between the two. Moreover, Joe is small peanuts in a town run by two mob leaders, one an Irishman and the other Italian. As fate would have it, Joe falls for the Irish mobster's ""moll"", Emma (Sienna Miller) and begins a clandestine affair, knowing the consequences if Boss Albert finds out. Joe daydreams so much about Emma that on a routine bank heist, his foggy mind upsets the apple cart. This leads to a police chase and fiery crash; Joe escapes, the cops do not. Albert IS looking for Joe, for he knows the score now, but doesn't get there before Tom arrives. Pulling strings, Tom gets Joe a very light sentence of three years. Wow. When he gets out, Joe doesn't know where Emma is, believing her to be dead, and decides to ""relocate"" to Tampa Florida, working for the Italian Boston Boss. He does this because the Irishman is worming his way into bootlegging and gambling down south, too, in Miami. Once there, Joe does a fabulous job, working with Cubans including lovely Graciela (Zoe Saldana). The straight-laced police chief, Figgis looks the other way and has a beautiful daughter, Loretta (Elle Fanning) who is off the star in Hollywood. But, what happens when the Italian mobster begins to believe Joe is weak and not into ""killing"" anymore? What about Albert, is he still looking for Joe? This very fine movie has great performances, many twists and turns, gorgeous sets, fabulous costumes, and a style that dazzles. Who can we thank? Why, first, Affleck who stars, writes, and directs and Dennis Lehane, whose novel came first. Purists may want to know that the ending of the film is different from the book while those who detest violence won't want to watch it. Even so, the violence is not pervasive and the story too good too miss. So, movie fan, don't skip it.",Live by Night

The weakest thing in it for me was lead performance - Ben Affleck definitely should have stick to directing and writing - acting as well in a lead role was clearly to much for him. He is a great director, superb writer and i never disliked him as an actor (as many do) - he is OK screen presence, but in ""Live by Night"" he was the weakest thing i think. ""Live by Night"" has an amazing production values - this is a gorgeously looking movie with a superb production design, costumes, cinematography - those are a first class production values. Acting was pretty good as well but the best performance here was by Sienna Miller in my opinion - she is hard to recognize - this is a another great performance by her, her Oscar nomination will be there one day i'm sure. The story was also involving - at running time 2 hours i wasn't bored for a second.Overall, ""Live by Night"" is a good movie overall, but not as good as previous films created by Ben Affleck. And in the future he should only direct and / or write - acting as well in lead roles is pretty to much, and it is clear in this picture.",Live by Night
22,Reno-Rangan,"Fall and rise, a revenge tale.",6,14 September 2017,"Number four for the director Affleck after his other film won the Oscars four years ago. He has also written the screenplay and produced it. It was based on the book of the same name. The story of a World War I veteran turned notorious gangster. Escaping from the war, falling in love with a gangster's woman, a bank heist, prison time, the son of a police officer and his journey to the top of the criminal world after losing everything at one stage of his life. More like a revenge film, but the intention was not aggressive. Only the time and the life passage give one to him.From all his directional films, probably this could be the worst one. It had everything a gangster film needed like gun fights, car chase, revenge, romance, yet I felt lacked depth in its overall theme. Actors were not bad, the settings looked fine. The length of the film was a bit long, but the film offered nothing new. It looked like someone's biography or made it look like one. I think that's the point. Even the end part of the film extends, only to annoy us after two long hours patiently sat for it.The best part of the film, what I liked was the 1920s. The story about between two the World Wars, that too was about an internal affair like underworld activities looked nice on the screen. The cast and crew were best for the film, yet failed to impress us. Though it was not totally a bad film of the year, only it did not stand and deliver as it was promised. So, still it can be watched once if you prefer, but not guaranteed entertainment.6/10",Live by Night
23,Rodrigo_Amaro,Affleck tried too much and forgot to deliver something worth seeing,5,1 April 2017,"It's hard to expect the director Ben Affleck to crash and burn in such a sad disappointing manner. He gave us ""Argo"", ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Town"", outstanding works of pure delight, great acting and surprisingly effective directing. The mentioned films had me at the edge of my seat, they provided spectacular moments of thrill and had positive relevance to life. ""Live by Night"" however was a struggle to endure by leaving me empty and tired, giving me less than expected and not carrying any kind of important relevance to anything. Problem is: it's the first time Mr. Affleck does the four main jobs on the same film, a task only destined to the likes of Chaplin, Welles or Beatty: writer, director, lead actor and producer. In the previous works, he always stopped with three functions and the results were brilliant. By adding one more function, he finally failed in possibly all accounts in a year that proved as one of his hardest (personal problems that were news at the end of the year) yet most prolific: the surprising ""The Accountant"" and the towering effort ""Batman v. Superman"" (and trust me, here's a film that didn't deserve half of the poor criticism is getting. The Ultimate Edition is a fine courageous 3-hour epic that works). So, a case of too much work that ruined the one thing he had under almost complete control? Possibly. And it breaks my heart in thumbing this down because a lot of people I admire are part of it and even though they form the best elements of the picture, they don't save it from its lack of goodness. ""Live by Night"" attempts to create a film noir atmosphere tailored with a complex web of characters and situations we don't like, don't fully understand and don't get any important perspective on why such story was needed to be told. I'm positively sure that Dennis Lehave novel might have something worth reading since he's a creative writer and of full hands when it comes to create something worth reading. Affleck gets all the wrong choices for someone as engaging as Lehane is. Unbereably dark cinematography, a suitable editing for action sequences but completely erratic for the dramatic ones; a peace and quiet that doesn't fit the movie, ruins its pace and makes it only worth seeing because it turns out to be the snooze fest of the year. Painfully tedious. The first half hour still has some mystery and we go along just fine; what comes from there it's just a strange roller-coaster that doesn't offer thrills, a point to make and or something to praise. But it all must fall on Affleck's back. Vanity and greed were his ultimate sins here. Why he had to make everything in this picture? In fact, I don't think there's any function for him at all in this film except producing. The script is weak, the lines written are dull and barely work; his direction of actors is suitable BUT he gave himself the lead role, possibly one of the dumbest lead characters I've ever seen and the amount of mistakes he makes during the film just makes him someone you don't care. Joe Coughlin knows how to pull off a heist but he's too naive when it comes to the matters of heart. And then we're trapped into countless problems: I'm not sure if Emma is really a low character that doesn't provide any appeal to me or if it's Sienna Miller characterization that didn't help me at all. Whatever the case, beauty it's in the eyes of beholder and love is only in someone's heart and I failed to understand why he cared for her. As for his leading role, oh Ben...the character is bland, cold and for the very few things he says about himself, you wonder if he isn't being too harsh on himself or too harsh about life; and someone with that mindset, why not shooting himself instead of going through life like a poor excuse for a human being. In terms of expectation vs. reality, ""Live by Night"" is a disappointment of near-epic proportions. The supporting cast makes the film (Brendan Gleeson, Chris Cooper, Chris Messina for some forced comic relief and even Clark Gregg's cameo); the production quality in technical aspects is fine but I hated the photography. The minor action sequences are worthy of praise - the car chase after the bank robbery and the final hotel shootout. But for what the film tried to show it wasn't enough for me to like it. What was the main thing here? That there's no way a good man can't be good again just because he's seen the horrors of war? That it's impossible to go through life without having to bow to someone more powerful than you? That matters of heart can't never go along with matters of business? There's no ultimate gain despite we're learning the lessons it shows. Perhaps the lesson is: make a movie but try not to overwork yourself in all functions because you'll overlook one aspect while trying to make it right with the others. It doesn't work unless you have perfect symmetry of functions. 5/10",Live by Night
24,tomgillespie2002,"Underwhelming, clichéd gangster flick",4,28 March 2017,"I highly doubt that many people believed that Ben Affleck would ever recover from the plethora of awful decisions he made between 2000 and 2004, when he starred in such duds as Bounce, Pearl Harbor, Daredevil and, of course, Gigli. But recover he did, and he did so from behind the camera, delivering a stream of solid thrillers such as Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and the Best Picture winner of 2012, Argo (the first film to win the prize without the director receiving a nomination). For a star on a roll, 2016 wasn't particularly pleasant for Affleck, with his superhero movies Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, along with his action movie The Accountant, all receiving a critical hammering (although I rather enjoyed the latter). His awaited return to directorial duties is also a bust; an underwhelming, clichéd gangster picture with a half-arsed performance by its lead, pulling in only $21 million from a $65 million budget.Joe Coughlin (Affleck) returns from fighting in World War I vowing never to kill another man. A petty bank robber and the son of an Irish police chief (Brendan Gleeson), Joe finds himself pulled into the gangster lifestyle when he falls in love with Emma Gould (Sienna Miller), the girlfriend of Irish mob boss Albert White (Robert Glenister). When their affair is uncovered, she wounds up dead and Joe is thrown into prison, serving only a few years thanks to the influence of his father. He comes out a changed man; one that is eager to take revenge and ready to embrace the lifestyle he always shunned in order to get it. Joe persuades White's rival, Italian boss Maso Pescatore (Remo Girone), to let him take over business in Tampa, where the rum business is booming thanks to Prohibition, and where White is trying to carve out a piece of the action for himself.Live by Night basically follows Joe throughout his criminal career, as he partners up with his comedy relief best friend Dion Bartolo (Chris Messina) and sets about putting his rivals out of business. Yet the biggest challenge to his reign is not the White gang, but the Ku Klux Klan, who disapprove of his doing business with black folks, and dating Cuban beauty Graciela (Zoe Saldana). The most engaging sub-plot involves Joe's relationship with the local police Chief Figgis (Chris Cooper), a man who claims to be un-corruptible, yet turns a blind eye to Joe's dirty dealings. His beautiful daughter Loretta (Elle Fanning) goes off to Hollywood to become a star, only to come back a broken woman with a heroin addiction. She finds God, and draws a huge crowd as she preaches against the sin engulfing their city, placing Joe's grand casino development under threat in the process.Whenever Cooper and Fanning are on screen, the movie hints at the far more interesting experience it could have been. The rest is a by-the-numbers gangster flick with the familiar good man corrupted by a thirst for success and power at its centre. There is some sumptuous cinematography and some colourful costume design to distract from the mediocrity of the story and performances, and an exciting shoot-out finale, but this is nowhere near enough to make up for how utterly bland Affleck's picture is. The talents of Gleeson and Saldana are wasted in underdeveloped roles, with only Messina's affable sidekick Bartolo identifiable as a fully realised character. Affleck plays the lead as stoic and damaged, but he fails to convince of the emotional turmoil bubbling beneath the surface. While it's hardly as outright embarrassing as Warner Bros.' other crime saga flop Gangster Squad (2013), the studio obviously knew they had a stinker when Live by Night was rushed onto Blu Ray a measly two months after hitting theatres.",Live by Night
25,cruise01,"A Prohibition era crime film with a stunning visual tone, and a outstanding direction.",7,12 January 2017,"I enjoyed Ben Affleck's previous work like The Town and Argo, which they both were able to capture the tone and the characters. Live By Night has some colorful visuals to the tone such as characters, the setting at Tampa and some 1920s set design and costumes. It does have a pretty exciting car chase and intense gun shoot outs. Ben Affleck's only weakness with the film besides traveling through familiar ground with mafia gangster films and the consequences the characters face; the plot does get crammed up in trying to introduce several characters at a quick pace making it less focused on the characters arc. Plot wise the story was good but it was becoming unfocused with characters coming and going. Plot follows Joe Coughlin (Ben Affleck) a World War I veteran that ""went away as a soldier and came home an outlaw."" Without giving much away with the plot besides Joe is working his way to the top with an Italian Mob and is sent to Tampa to help run his rum empire. From meeting the town's sheriff Irving (Chris Cooper), his daughter Loretta (Elle Fanning), and Graciella (Zoe Saldana). Joe takes advantage of the Prohibition and create opportunities from casinos, clubs, etc. With Loretta's Christian preaching that is against what Joe is working towards and the Italian mob over his shoulders about his empire. Characters loyalties are tested and betrayed from those they love and the actions are followed by consequences that Joe will face. Ben Affleck was able to create an exciting car chase in the Boston setting. Especially, the chases with the classic cars. The gun shoot outs were intense and especially the climax with everything blowing over plot wise. The cinematography was able to capture the visual settings of Tampa and its stunning view of the lake and some beautiful scenery. From the set design and costumes, Affleck did well in trying to make it flashy without overdoing it. Also, the best thing he was able to capture on camera and also his weakness was the characters. Every one had their moments that helped the plot progressed. At times, some characters felt unfocused as they appear on and off screen and for a reason. Only if there was a script rewrite in maintaining the dramatic tension between these characters could have been an improvement. The whole cast ensemble worked well with Ben Affleck, Elle Fanning, Chris Messina, Sienna Miller, Zoe Saldana, and Chris Cooper.

None of the supporting characters were developed and were there as a means to accompany Affleck on his quest for money and redemption. I felt no emotional attachment towards any of them. The story was utterly tedious as it's paced slower than a 1920's automobile. For an overstuffed plot, I'm surprised that nothing really happens. I will say that the Prohibition-era production design was authentic and the accompanying visual style was glamorously glossy. Just unfortunate that every other element was glossed over.

As the movie opens, Joe tells (in a voice over) about his service during WWI (""I left a soldier, I came home an outlaw""), and how upon his return to Boston, he eventually (in the late 1920s) got recruited by the head of the Irish mob, Albert White, whose girlfriend Emma is having an affair with Joe (got all that?). It's not long before that gets Joe into trouble, when the head of the Italian mob blackmails him: ""kill Alfred White or if not, get killed by White after I tell him about the affair"". At this point we're maybe 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is another ""Ben Affleck product"", as he stars, produces, directs and writes the screenplay (based on the book of the same name by Dennis LeHane, who also authored ""Gone Baby Gone"", Affleck's directing debut). I have not read the book, so I can't comment how closely Affleck sticks to the original story. On the big screen, the story line of ""Live By Night"" is convoluted yet plausible. TH=he movie this reminds of most closely is of course ""The Godfather Part 2"", with Affleck taking over the role of Al Pacino (just look at the cover picture where Affleck sits in a chair holding a gun). Alas, ""Live By Night"" is no ""Godfather"", far from it. Yes, at times there are some exciting scenes (the car chase early on in the movie may be the best we've ever seen, at least when it involves period cars of the late 20s). But the movie fails to get us engrossed. Worse, it fails to get us emotionally invested in these characters, a fatal flaw for a movie of this type. Yes, I'm watching great actors and actresses (Affleck, Chris Cooper, Ellie Fanning in a small but powerful role, Zoe Saldana, Sienna Miller, etc.). Plenty of style and visual gloss in the movie, that's not the issue, but not nearly enough. At one point the Ellie Fanning character comments in a wistful moment ""this is heaven, right here!"". Alas, it is not the case while watching the movie. My disappointment is even bigger when you think of the fantastic movies that Affleck has directed before, and in particular 'The Town"" and ""Argo"", both top-notch movies.""Live By Night"" got a wide release this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it (based on both the trailer and Affleck's previous work as director). The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was not attended very well (15-20 people), considering this is the movie's opening night. I'm afraid this movie will not last very long in the theater.

Over a hundred years ago the Italians were no better than the Cubans who occupied Tampa Bay and it was strange seeing that culture in the film. The action was great. The movie has a few awesome car chases using 1920s cars and it looked amazing. Plus the big shoot out would make Scarface bashful of the violence. I'm so impressed.The music in was great and lended perfectly to the dramatic scenesAnd I love how sarcastic the film is. Pokes a little fun at itself and the stereotypes of being a gangster film.Fantastic Job, Ben!http://cinemagardens.com",Live by Night
32,stevendbeard,Good But A Little Slow,6,13 January 2017,"I saw ""Live By Night"", starring Ben Affleck-The Accountant, Dazed and Confused; Zoe Saldana-Guardians of the Galaxy, Avatar; Elle Fanning- Maleficent, Super 8 and Chris Cooper-The Amazing Spider-Man 2, The Town.This is a gangster movie set in the 1920's. It's directed by Ben Affleck. Ben plays a disillusioned soldier from WW1 that has come home to Boston to become an outlaw-he doesn't use a gun because he doesn't want to kill anybody after what he saw in the war. He doesn't want to join the Irish or the Italian mobs so he ends up in Florida during prohibition and becomes involved in the alcohol business-selling to people in need. He meets Zoe, a Cuban involved in importing rum, and they fall in love. Moving to Florida still had it's share of problems though; Both groups of Irish and Italian mobsters end up in Florida, too. Plus he has to fight religious zealots wanting to put him out of business and even the KKK gets into his affairs, wanting their cut of things. Chris plays a local policeman and Elle is his daughter, the leader of the religious zealots. There are a couple of cameos; I remember seeing Anthony Michael Hall and Clark Gregg. It's an all-right gangster movie-good action and nice sets-except it does get a little slow in a few parts. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-including partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 8 minutes. I don't think I would buy it on DVD-Did I mention it was a little slow?- but it would be alright as a rental.",Live by Night
33,alindsay-al,An average gangster film that is pretty by the numbers,5,18 January 2017,"I love the films that ben affleck has directed and I think he has been giving great performances consistently for the past few years so I was interested to see live by night but unfortunately it was a pretty big disappointment. The premise sees in prohibition era a Boston gangster gets moved to Florida to try and build an empire. Ben affleck is the lead in this film and he does a great job in the lead, you end up caring about his character even though he does bad things. He is pretty complex as you see his character develop throughout the film and affleck adds allot to his character. Chris cooper gave a good performance as the police captain and I liked how his character developed for the majority of the film. I really like Chris messina as afflecks buddy and I thought he was really funny and their chemistry really worked for this film. Unfortunately, I felt let down by the female characters in this film whether it was Elle fanning, Sienna miller or Zoe zaldana they just didn't stand out. I didn't find any of them very compelling and I feel like numerous people could have played there roles just as well or even better. The story of this film is incredibly messy and there is just so much going on that none of the story arcs feel special or unique. This film tries to be too complex with its storytelling and it comes across a boring and contrived. The script has some pretty funny dialogue in it and it feels pretty real for a gangster film. But the dramatic dialogue just doesn't work enough that it makes you care about the characters enough, which you just don't. The style of the film has some great actions scenes and some especially brutal sounding hits. However they don't happen enough and the pacing of the film is just terrible. The first 30 mins is pretty good and then the film changes and goes a different direction really out of nowhere that is just not as interesting. Overall this is a really average disappointing film that isn't worth a watch really in my opinion even though I am a big fan usually of the films affleck usually directs.",Live by Night

He strikes all the right notes, high production value, entertaining action, accurate costumes and sets with sold dialog and emotion yet the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts. While certainly competent, it lacks a memorable touch.

35,juneebuggy,"Long, boring and meandering",4,3 October 2019,"This sprawling crime epic set in the prohibition era was long, boring, and meandering. It follows Ben Affleck as the son of a Boston police lieutenant who moves to Florida after a bank robbery gone wrong and stint in jail. He then becomes a bootlegger. As his operation grows he faces off against local gangsters, Klansmen and religious evangelicals.Some decent action scenes using guns and cool cars from the 1920's and an impressive cast attached to the many characters but the storyline is so jumbled and flat you don't really get to know or care about anyone. Except maybe Elle Fanning who shines.Ben Affleck just seemed out of place throughout, bored and miserable with one single facial expression (see movie poster -that never changes). He's also too old for this role, playing a young man in his 20's/30's rising to power.

Unless i had the urge but it's a solid period piece with some excellent gun fight scenes & brutal shootouts but it's also alot of talking & very few action scenes.
The cast was good but the only ones who need a mention really are the two best buds of the film, obviously Affleck as ""Joe"" but also his old crew mate who ends up working with him down in the Florida part of the movie, he's called ""Dion Bartolo"" played by Chris Messina & he's the only guy Affleck can trust in the whole movie & it's a nice buddy chemistry feel to those two in every scene they share, both give great performances.
It's start out in the gritty & grey urban setting of Boston but later the story moves Affleck to the sun drenched streets of Florida & Miami & the scenery is beautiful & there's some good bits throughout but my main complaint was that it didn't have enough violence & action scenes & it went for more a romantic drama feel instead of the gritty violent Action of the beginning but that being said it's a good movie & well made.",Live by Night

I came home an outlaw.""Ben Affleck isn't exactly one of my favorite actors. Not that he's such a terrible actor, but he's such a smooth guy who manages to play in some outstanding movies every time. Movies that didn't leave an everlasting impression on me anyway. In retrospect, it's really a giant list I've seen him in, such as ""The Accountant"", ""Suicide Squad"", ""Batman v Superman"", ""Gone Girl"", ""Runner Runner"", ""Paycheck"", ""Changing Lanes"", ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Daredevil"" (absolutely his worst performance). The only memorable role he played was in ""Good Will Hunting"". Most probably it's due to the participation of Matt Damon and Robin Williams. He was also successful as a producer and directed the absolute masterpiece ""Argo"". With ""Live by Night"" he tries to be successful as leading actor and at the same time as a producer. But that's a bridge too far in my opinion.The result is pleasing to the eye, but story wise it's all rather messy and hopelessly complicated. The multiple story lines follow each other in a terrible pace. The main thread is about the prohibition era and illegal trade of alcoholic beverages. Furthermore there are some side plots in which the main role is claimed by a female character. At first Emma Gould (Sienna Miller), mistress of a mafia boss. Then there's the sister of a Cuban business partner (Zoe Saldana). And finally, the daughter (Ella Fanning) of the sheriff from Tampa who's being rescued by Joe (Ben Affleck) after she pursuit her luck in Hollywood and ended up as an addicted prostitute. Afterwards she turns out to be a prophet of doom who boycotts Joe's plan to build a huge casino in Tampa.Just like ""Argo"", this is an adaptation of a book by Dennis Lehane. In the past it's often proved that making a film based on a book isn't that easy. The big problem is to reproduce the details of a book into a movie. Usually as a result you get a jam packed film crammed with tangled story lines. The solution would be to split it up into multiple movies. But that's not really applicable to ""Live by night"". The most successful part is the way they portrayed this era by using excellent camera-work. A realistic view of America from the 20s, thanks to the magnificent sets, beautiful costumes and authentic props. Ultimately it's not a truly epic gangster film, but the chase with old timers at the beginning of the film and the explosive ending led to some impressive images.In my opinion the biggest problem in this not so bad film, was the acting of Affleck himself. And this has nothing to do with his talent as an actor but rather with his goody-goody appearance. Without a doubt many mothers hope that their daughter would hook up with such a perfect guy. Ideal son in law material, so to speak. But as a gangster he fails completely. Because of his likable appearance his performance is absolutely implausible. Had they given this part to Michael Shannon for example, the tone of the film would have been harsher and more intimidating. You can safely say this was an ambitious project, but unfortunately it's a soft version of any leading gangster epic from the past. More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",Live by Night
39,AudioFileZ,Reaches High In Production Only To Be Just OK,6,28 January 2017,"In quite a few ways Live By Night is not unlike gangster films of the 50's (albeit this one has a huge budget) where they cranked 'em out with a known big name and that was that. Most were watchable, predictable, and not particularly distinguished. It was an in-vogue genre and that assured an audience. In modern times as the genre had ran its course it would take an exceptional film such as The Godfather or Scarface to breathe new life in what seemed a passe' category. Those films weren't revisionist as they focused on the latter day mobsters with much realism. The Godfather and Scarface became iconic. Live By Night isn't in that category as it tells a more fictitious story of prohibition tale of east and south coast mob activity during prohibition. In this it strives to be more epic than it can achieve. Things aren't terribly bad as it has beautiful period sets, spectacular cinematography and a talented cast. The weak link is the story. It's one that is so standard as to be bland in spite of the abundant betrayals and violence . There's no one, particularly, to root for making it difficult to fully invest in. It, therefore, comes off not epic and much closer to pedestrian. In fairness I haven't seen a recent crime flick I'd rate much higher - and certainly not from the true era of the rise of the gangster in America. So, lower your expectations a bit if this genre remains of interest. This is an O.K. film, just not a definitive or iconic within the genre.",Live by Night
40,rgkarim,Not Really Living To Its Full Potential,6,14 January 2017,"Gangster movies have been a major component to American cinema for quite some time. With established films like The Godfather series, Scarface, among other films, sometimes it can be hard to produce a quality modern day crime film. But Ben Affleck has made an attempt this weekend with the movie Live by Night. Can Affleck's recent resurgence revitalize the gang movie, or does his operation go belly up before it gets started? Robbie K here with another review and as always appreciate the read. LIKES:  Solid acting  Incredible Setting and Costumes  Very Detailed Description of a mob risingSummary: Affleck's stoic, monotone, performances continue to find footholds in a variety of parts, and his portrayal of a gangster with a conscience is spot on. Although not the most emotionally dynamic character, Affleck's tactics work in portraying a man struggling with the trials at hand. Chris Messina as his sidekick has more of an edge that helps offset the monotone delivery of the lead role. Other actors do their job of crafting the seedy mob family, being cunning, ruthless, or strong to accomplish their goals. If the acting doesn't sell the gangster setting than the costumes and scenery will do the trick. Live by Night uses the big budget of the film industry to recreate the roaring 20s, complete with old fashioned zoot suits, classic car models, and the nostalgic traditional models of high-end restaurants. I felt I had traveled back in time in this flick, with only the high definition cameras and a recognition of modern day fabric to shatter the illusion. Finally, the other component that sells the crime theme is the attention to detail of starting a crime syndicate. Most other crime movies often have our character in an established family, but Live By Night twists this concept and casts Affleck into raising a satellite family in Florida. Much of the film is focuses on how he establishes business contracts, allies, love, occasionally throwing in some conflict resolution that brings a little excitement to the film. DISLIKES:  Slow pace  Awkward Summaries  Boring At times  Rushed over endingSummary: Although some of my favorite mafia movies don't have action, they at least have an engaging plot that is suspenseful. Not the case for this movie. Live by Night is slow, often paying a little too much attention to monotonous details for building the empire. The film tried to build the suspense with their overdone explanations that promised some heart crushing moments... only to wrap things up with a monologue from Affleck describing what happened. These mundane, overlapping comments did little for me other than decrease the run time of the movie and I was disappointed at the lack of effort for drama. The result for me was a very boring film not only in terms of action, but in emotional suspense as well. If you look at the classics, the storytellers built up tension that climaxed at those gut-wrenching moments as a character was killed. However in this film, they seldom came close to matching that suspense, the only exception being two moments near the end of the film. And speaking of the ending it felt out of place for me. Live By nights ""exciting"" climax has a heated battle that fits well into the theme of the movie, but finally relieves the boring moments. Had they ended with the monologue after that it would have been perfect. Yet, the movie didn't stop and added an extra twenty minutes that summed things up, but in a manner that to me was very simplistic, rushed, and lackluster. The VERDICT:Live by Night is a gangster movie that felt more like a video guide to starting a bootlegging operation. It certainly has the look and feel of a gangster movie, complete with family drama, but it lacks that edge the mobster classics had. Outside of a few moments, this movie was a little toned down for my tastes, and I didn't like the monologue summaries as they robbed us of some exciting conclusions. Therefore, this reviewer can't recommend this movie for the theater outside of the look of the movie. My scores are:Crime Drama: 6.5 Movie Overall: 5.0",Live by Night
41,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Live by Night,8,19 January 2017,"Ah yes, another holdover from last year. So OK, would I put it in my top ten? Oh absotively boss, absotively! Here goes nothing:What I learned from Live by Night (my latest review), is that Ben Affleck has yet to make a bad movie. His direction here is lush and unwittingly glossy. The cinematography, set design, period detail, and costume design concerning ""Night"", are all of the highest order (the goon characters love their fedoras, the women characters love their Cloches). ""Night's"" setting is 1920's Boston and late 1920's South Florida. A frenzied car chase here, a speedy robbery there. Yeah, this is Affleck's The Cotton Club (minus the dancing), his Public Enemies, his Road to Perdition. It's the Good Ol' Days coupled with the good old boys. Yup, it's a slam-bang action style event. Anyway, Ben Affleck plays Joe Coughlin, a World War I veteran. He's a small time crook who doesn't want to be a gangster but ends up being one anyway. Like Affleck's own trouper in The Town, he's a nice guy criminal who eventually wants to leave the bad guy life. He's not about the kills and he's not about the forgone anguish. Affleck has cast himself in the lead in three of the four films he has helmed. Out of Argo, ""Night"", and ""Town"", Live by Night is his finest work lighting both ends of the candle. At 129 minutes, Live by Night is not overlong by most gangster flick standards. However, it could have used a little tighter editing. Nevertheless, its stride is frantic with Affleck's camera flying all over the place (it truly whips and follows). Bullet-ridden, bloody, and despairing are words I would use in my hasty description.Live by Night is rampantly based on a novel by Dennis Lehane. The Drop, Mystic River, and Gone Baby Gone are other movies adapted from Lehane's writing. In terms of the music, well the score by Harry Gregson-Williams gives Live by Night a sense of foreboding throughout. The cast including Brendan Gleeson, Elle Fanning, an unrecognizable Sienna Miller, and Zoe Saldana, harbor great supporting work throughout as well. Lastly, the concluding, gruesome shootout scene in ""Night"" is its ultimate pinnacle. I didn't pick up on the irony firsthand. Regardless, it sealed my heralded recommendation.All in all, I've liked every single movie that Ben Affleck has ever directed. With 2016's Live by Night, he's now batting 1000. This film ""lives"" and breathes freely. Hot dawg! Rating: 3 and a half stars.",Live by Night
42,bkrauser-81-311064,A Disjointed Highlight Reel,6,16 January 2017,"A movie based on a novel by Dennis ""Mystic River, Shutter Island, Gone Baby Gone"" Lehane, dealing with a revenge-seeking gangster, living in an uncomfortable nexus between Boston prohibition era gang wars, southern Floridian racial politics and revival tent religiousness. How, oh how did they screw this one up? How could they have taken a story so immediately appealing and thick with tried-and-true genre conventions exploring worthwhile themes, and turned it into a disjointed Frankenstein's monster? I'm not so much asking because I'm angry, I'm asking because I'm genuinely impressed.Live by Night centers on the complicated machinations of Boston hoodlum Joe Coughlin (Affleck) whose small time banditry captures the attention of rival mob bosses. While Joe is Irish (and the son of a police constable), his sympathies lie more or less with Italian mob boss Maso Pescatore (Girone). He further endears himself to Pescatore after Irish mob boss Albert White (Glenister) kills Coughlin's lover (Miller) and nearly kills him if not for the interference of Boston's finest. After a stint in jail, Joe vows revenge by administrating Pescatore's interests in Tampa while choking White and his crew out of the rum trade. While doing so, Joe falls in love with a local crime bosses sister (Saldana), truces with Tampa's Police Chief (Cooper) and receives the ire of the local KKK.Live by Night, for all its good intentions, has all the focus of a barrel of buckshot. It sprays its themes in every which way desperately hoping the audience will connect the dots with extended periods of voice over narration. When we're not forced to listen to Affleck's gravelly voiced monologues, we get to experience the actor himself, who uneasily takes the limelight by wearing his wardrobe with the color symbolism of a mood ring.The tragedy is as a proved actor and director, Affleck should have been able to take this kind of material and make it shine like a fifty cent piece. But due to maybe the vastness of the material (or maybe Warner Bros. penchant for meddling), Affleck just seems unsure of himself both in front and behind the camera. Each scene is caked with exciting period detail yet there's no pulse, no bustle, not vibrancy to everything that's put on the screen. There are a lot of good moments in the film (many provided by Matthew Maher's deep fried racist nincompoop), but because there's such a lack of focus or tension, each moment happens in a vacuum and slowly suffocates in the void.Live by Night feels like three great seasons of a decent cable show that's been chopped up and awkwardly smooshed together to make a highlights reel. Just like the skeleton of the casino that's being built in this film, everywhere you look there are hints of grandeur. Unfortunately that grandeur never comes and all you're left with is a great looking structure that's quickly sinking in a swamp of molasses.",Live by Night
43,arungeorge13,Director Affleck's weakest film so far! [+47%],5,6 July 2017,"Affleck's fourth major directorial unfortunately does not carry the artistic deft of his previous works. He has chosen to adapt another of Dennis Lehane's novels (after the excellent 'Gone Baby Gone') but the result this time turns out to be quite underwhelming. Affleck seems to revel in holding the spotlight around his central character of petty-crook WWI returnee Joe Coughlin. None of the supporting characters are strong enough to stand on their own feet; they're either seen admiring Joe (like Chris Messina's Dion and Zoe Saldanha's Graciela) or merely disgusted by his antics (like Chris Cooper's Chief Figgis and Brendan Gleeson's Thomas Coughlin, Joe's dad) to the fullest extent. It so happens that when some of the characters start exhibiting a fair bit of promise, they're quickly written off/killed (like Sienna Miller's Emma Gould or Elle Fanning's Loretta, the daughter of Chief Figgis).The first half revolves around events that take place in Boston while the second frantically moves on to Tampa, a transition that implies enhancement in Joe's activities as a gangster but never as a captivating movie character. Affleck has recruited some of the best in the business for making his film look terrific. Tarantino-regular Robert Richardson is the cinematographer, Jess Gonchor (a Coen brothers regular) is production designer; we have set decor work by Nancy Haigh (another Coens' regular), music by Harry Gregson-Williams and a bunch of talented art directors. The ensemble (cast) on board is one that's capable of doing wonders if given solid, well-written characters. Yet, the movie never manages to rise above its surface glow. One tends to get a feeling that there was indeed a powerful story to be told but this effort by Affleck appears exceedingly rushed prior to resuming his 'Batman' duties. 'Live by Night' is Affleck's costliest film to date, boasting of lavish sets and on-point costumes. The characters however, do not carry the same kind of sophistication. This is a film that the viewer will soon forget, if not immediately; and that's not exactly the way we have grown to love Affleck's other directorial efforts.",Live by Night
44,maurice_yacowar,Independent gangster almost survives criminal contamination.,7,26 January 2017,"Ben Affleck can make a good, smart film. In this richly detailed 1920s film noir he uses the genre conventions to anatomize contemporary America. That is, Donald Trump's America.The film is framed by the two world wars. Joe Coughlin comes home from the First, disillusioned, betrayed by authority, determined to be an outlaw, despite his father's being a prominent honest cop. At the end he has survived a gang war, won and walked away from a criminal empire, and lost his two great loves. At a Saturday matinée with his son, he watches a Hitler newsreel. Germany won't go to war, he assures himself. Well, Germany did. WW II waits on the wings. Hitler's strategies to turn a democracy into his dictatorship seem eerily repeated now. Proving Affleck's prescience, the first days of the Trump presidency reveal the leader's suppression of the press, science, education, dissent and the marginalized, the standard dictator's game plan. In a genre film as in water, the flavour derives from the impurities, in the inflections played upon the familiar conventions. For example, Coughlin is a modest criminal, content to be a robber, with no ambition to be a gangster. He opts to stay out of the gang war. He's (literally) a white suit villain which makes him a relative hero in this criminal world. ""You realize to be free in this life, breaking the rules meant nothing. You have to be strong enough to make your own."" He eschews selling drugs and women, satisfied to deal just in demon rum and gambling. He also has the will to leave his evil empire behind. The film's identity politics begins with the genre's familiar clash between the Irish and the Italian criminal worlds. But Affleck digs deeper. Coughlin's first love Emma is ruined by her inability to overcome not just the anti-Irish bigotry but her own lack of self-respect it causes. The clash between these ethnic groups also points to Trump's cultivated prejudice against immigrants. A more significant inflection is the involvement of the Klu Kux Klan in this film's criminality. I don't remember the Klan as a significant player in any other American gangster film. Here it represents the bedrock of racism that persists in American culture and the criminal undertow in society's more respectable areas, corporate, judicial, social. As the Grand Wizard says behind his cigar-factory desk, ""We're clerks, bankers, police officers, we ain't gotta judge. And if ya gonna fight us, I'm gonna rain bloody hellfire down on you and all you love."" David Duke's endorsement of Trump and celebration of his win confirm this currency. Affleck also adds the strong theme of religious fundamentalism, a pillar of the current Republican platform. Hence the Figgis subplot. Chief Figgis is an upfront cop who allows Coughlin a safe territory but also protects his crazed crooked brother-in-law (""dumb as a grape""). To turn Figgis against the overreaching dolt, Coughlin deploys what he knows about Figgis's pretty young daughter. Her Hollywood dream shattered, the innocent Loretta has fallen into drugs and prostitution.Loretta's story reflects upon America's extremist right puritanism. Having pulled her out of the drug and prostitution scene, her father literally flays the sin out of her, an especially salacious discipline. The whipping is shadowed by her line, ""He can't stop thinking about other men doing to me what he did to my mother."" Here Figgis evokes the Republican moralists themselves busted for gay sex and adultery, the very targets of their righteous rhetoric. Figgis can't forgive Coughlin for revealing his daughters fate to him, even though it enabled him to save her. He ends his life compulsively muttering ""Repent,"" then dies trying to kill Coughlin. Loretta turns into a moral crusader, sensationalizing her sinful past to win the reputation of a saver of souls. After thwarting Coughlin's casino plans she privately tells him her own doubts about God and any heavenly afterlife. Then she slashes her throat — on her father's bed. Her righteousness proves as inadequate as her self-debasement.From her Coughlin picks up the idea that the only heaven we ever have is this life and we're messing it up. The heaven on earth is the point of the hero's two great loves, one ended by betrayal, the other by the intrusion of the righteous madman. So, too, the violent narrative is punctuated with interludes of breath-taking beauty, whether scenes of nature or the elegance of a simple motion. When a man is thrown to his sidewalk death, his hat wafts down elegantly beside him. There is natural beauty, accidental beauty, but we're turning our one and present heaven into hell. As a reflection upon today's America, perhaps the film's key scene is Coughlin's final confrontation of his mentor Pescatore. Coughlin dismisses the mobster's pretence to values and honour with a survey of all the communities who are helplessly deceived, exploited, abused and robbed by their systemic overlords. If the thus abused and deprived ever collect their will and force he would not want to stand between them and what they deserve. That energizing of the abused is what Hitler achieved — and what just got Donald J. Trump elected too, despite his utter inadequacy for the office.",Live by Night

48,rockman182,Live by Night (2016),8,1 January 2017,"I've been a fan of Ben Affleck's directional efforts ever since I saw Gone Baby Gone way back in 2007 in theaters. I also loved The Town and think its his best film to date. Live by Night sort of came out of nowhere but I'm always down for Prohibition era crime films. The film seemed to get lukewarm reviews but there was no way I wasn't going to see this for myself. Overall, I'd say I enjoyed it and its better than what other critics are saying.The film is set in Boston (and then Tampa) and is the story of the son of a police captain, who becomes a bootlegger and gangster. Be forewarned that there isn't much that separates this from gangster films we've seen before, however Affleck knows what he's doing and I think he does it well. The thing that pops out to me is the dialogue. Its quite clever and witty. There's funny moments and the film isn't always super serious, which is refreshing. Not everything in the script has to be explained as the viewers are expected to follow the message. The suits, cars, glamour, of the 20s and 30s is captured quite well (not that I lived in that era to really know if it was accurate). Some of the dialogue was hard to hear in theaters (the accents probably contributed to this). I think this film will one day warrant a second view anyways.While I really enjoyed the film, it isn't without faults. It really depends on whether you can forgive the film for that or really see it as a detriment. Some of the characters felt loose and suddenly disappear. This includes Siena Miller, Elle Fanning and Brendan Gleeson. Fates of characters are explained and such but they feel unfulfilled. I thought Fanning's character was just becoming great, but as I said unfulfilled. Miller's character arc was just so odd as well (maybe rushed to fit the story). Well, at least my boy Miguel was in this. The film seems to want to tackle a few foes/events in different parts of the film and doesn't always do it seamlessly, which makes the film seem unfocused. The events of the third act felt rushed together just to come to a resolution. Without going into spoiling there's a head scratching moment near the end that seemed out of left field. I didn't have too many problems with all this and maybe its because I'm partial to Affleck and gangster films.I enjoyed the car chase and gun battles. I think the comic element of the film kind of swept into the action scenes which made it enjoyable. I liked that the film takes place in Tampa and mixes with the Black and Cuban community as well. Its nice to see a sort of different locality in a gangster film. I'm sure there's much more I want to ramble about but nothings coming to me. Overall, this probably won't be something that'll be a the top of year end lists but its thoroughly enjoyable even through its flaws. Its not Affleck's best but I applaud him for directing and writing films in a time where he's busy being in blockbusters.8/10",Live by Night
49,Quietb-1,Like the Tommy Gun bullets this misses the mark most of the time.,4,19 January 2017,"Looks good but that's about it. It's long and often dull. It suffers from the written and directed by syndrome. The director is hesitant to cut any of the brilliant writing. The movie stars the writer directer so perhaps he didn't notice the stiff, emotionless performance of the leading man. It would have been longer but we were spared seeing some events by droning voice over. The surprises were telegraphed so there are no surprises. The photo of the assumed dead character hangs on the wall complete with a newspaper time stamp. How convenient for the writer. The long, too late scene with her could have been omitted as it didn't matter if she was in hiding or dead.There are slow cars going fast. Plenty of shots fired. At one point you're not sure who is shooting at whom and eventually they don't seem to care which side they chose. Don't get attached to any of the strong female characters as they don't make it to the long over due fade out.The movie looks good on the big screen. If you see it on a home platform you might doze off, making for a better movie experience.",Live by Night
50,bankofmarquis,Dull and Boring,4,16 January 2017,"There are times when I say you must see a film on the big screen at the movie theater.The new Ben Affleck film, LIVE BY NIGHT, is one that is perfect for viewing at home on a cold, Saturday afternoon, curled up on the couch with a pillow and a blanket, for it will help you fall asleep and you can take a wonderful nap.This move is D-U-L-L and B-O-R-I-N-G.Written, directed and starring Affleck from a novel by Dennis LeHane (GONE BABY GONE, MYSTIC RIVER), LIVE BY NIGHT tells the tale of a Gangster, Joe Coughlin (played by Affleck) in the 1930's.  It has the scope and breadth of a sweeping epic, but the budget and focus of a TV movie - and that's where it fails.Affleck's script focuses solely on Affleck's character, hopping past the events of the world and others in his life, missing any real depth, character or emotion in each of these moments, so when one character dies, or an event in the world (like an attack by the Klu Klux Klan) occurs, it rings hollow, like we are flipping past images in a magazine.Not helping things is Affleck's portrayal of Coughlin as soulless and emotional-less, always calculating the odds.  This makes his character cold, not emotional and that is just not interesting enough to watch.  It might have worked had Affleck fleshed out the other characters, but casting strong actors like Chris Cooper, Brendan Gleeson, Elle Fanning, Sienna Miller and Zoe Saldana does not a character make.  Each of these are in the film fleetingly and only serve as vessels for Affleck's character to bounce off of, so, in the end we don't care about any of them - it is a waste of these talents and a waste of our time.Affleck does try to make something of Chris Messina's character as Coughlin's best pal and right hand man, but Messina just isn't strong enough to overcome the weak script and character development delivered to him.Affleck's script and direction are also dull, lifeless and clinical - professionally made, but with no heart, soul or emotion and in the end it left me cold and uncaring about the events unfolding.There is a good movie in this idea, this wasn't it.Letter Grade:  ""C""4 stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Live by Night
51,dave-mcclain,"""Live by Night"" is a passable morality play and action flick, but its contrived plot and dull characters disappoint.",3,19 January 2017,"In 1972, director Francis Ford Coppola brought to the big screen a novel called ""The Godfather"", about a fictional Italian-American crime family. The title character's son, Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino in the Best Picture Oscar-winning film), was a war veteran who wanted nothing to do with his father's business, but ends up running that business and becoming even more ruthless than his father had been. 2016's ""Live by Night"" (R, 2:09) is based on the 2012 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane (whose earlier books ""Gone, Baby, Gone"", ""Mystic River"" and ""Shutter Island"" also made it to the big screen) features a main character similar to that of Michael Corleone in ""The Godfather"", but isn't as interesting.Joe Coughlin (Ben Affleck, who also adapted Lehane's novel and directs) is the son of a Boston police captain (Brendan Gleeson) and a veteran of World War I, an experience which definitively shaped Joe's outlook on life. He returns from the war disillusioned and with no respect for rules or authority. Joe embarks on a life of crime, but is content with an armed robbery here and there and doesn't want to become a murderous monster like rival Boston crime bosses Albert White (Robert Glenister) and Maso Pescatore (Remo Girone). Unwisely, Joe is involved in an affair with White's girlfriend, Emma Gould (Sienna Miller), which makes Joe a pawn in the contest of wills between the two gangsters. With help from his friend and partner, Dion Bartolo (Chris Messina), Joe robs a bank so he can get enough money to run to California with Emma. When the robbery goes wrong, Joe ends up in prison for his crimes.After doing his time, Joe reunites with Dion and goes to work for Pescatore, who puts Joe in charge of his rum-running activities in Florida. That's where Joe meets and falls in love with a fiery Cuban woman named Garciela Corrales (Zoe Saldana). Garciela wonders aloud if Joe is tough enough to succeed on the path that he has chosen. Joe rises to the challenge as he has to battle the local Ku Klux Klan (embodied by Matthew Maher and Anthony Michael Hall) for business and personal reasons, but also shows his underlying humanity as he helps free a young woman named Loretta (Elle Fanning), the daughter of local Sheriff Irving Figgis (Chris Cooper), from being exploited while trying to become an actress in L.A. Joe has to confront a new set of challenges when Loretta emerges from her personal turmoil as a popular revivalist and preaches loudly about the evils of gambling, just as Joe is building a casino.""Live by Night"" is a half-way decent but forgettable gangster movie. Although Joe Coughlin may follow a path similar to Michael Corleone, he's really more like Sean Penn's character in 2015's mediocre ""The Gunman"", while this film more closely matches the quality of the latter than the former. Like Penn's character, Joe is portrayed as a sympathetic murderer who clings to his humanity and tries to atone for his sins by doing some good, but the message is practically lost in uninspired twists and half-hearted attempts to be clever and deep. ""Live by Night"" is a passable morality play and action flick, but its contrived plot and dull characters disappoint. ""C""",Live by Night
52,swilliky,Mediocre period piece,5,17 January 2017,"Ben Affleck's passion project sponsored by Warner Bros. thanks to his performance as Batman was to adapt Dennis Lehane's novel of the same title. Though abridged, the story is rather faithful to the book, which I read about two years ago. It begins with World War I veteran turned outlaw Joe Couglin (Affleck) beat up in a bed. The beginning recounts Joe's attempts to stay out of the war between the Irish mob and the Italian mob and his affection for Emma Gould (Sienna Miller), who happens to also be the girlfriend of the Irish mob boss Albert White (Robert Glenister). Double-crossed and imprisoned, Joe has to make a deal with the Italian mob to strike back at White in his new spot down in Tampa Bay once his shortened sentence, thanks to his father Thomas (Brendan Gleeson), ends. Joe teams up with Dion Bartolo (Chris Messina) and takes over Ybor. He meets the lovely Graciela (Zoe Saldana) and goes into business with her and her brother Esteban (Miguel).

53,bob-the-movie-man,"""Sleep By Day....""",6,18 January 2017,"Ben Affleck's new movie could best be described as ""sprawling"". In both directing and writing the screenplay (based on a novel by Dennis Lehane), Affleck has aimed for a ""Godfather"" style gangster epic and missed: not missed by a country mile, but missed nonetheless.Morally bankrupted by his experiences in the trenches, Joe Coughlin (Affleck) returns to Boston to pick and choose which social rules he wants to follow. Not sociopathic per se, as he has a strong personal code of conduct, but Coughlin turns to robbery walking a delicate path between the warring mob factions of the Irish community, led by Albert White (the excellent Robert Glenister from TV's ""Hustle""), and the Italian community, led by Maso Pescatore (Remo Girone). Trying to keep him out of jail is his father (""Harry Potter""'s Brendan Gleeson) who – usefully – is the Deputy Police Chief. Life gets complicated when he falls in love with White's moll, Emma Gould (Sienna Miller). The scene is set for a drama stretching from Boston to the hot and steamy Everglades over a period of the next twenty years.Although a watchable popcorn film, the choppy episodic nature of the movie is hugely frustrating, with no compelling story arc to glue all of the disparate parts together. The (often very violent) action scenes are very well done and exciting but as a viewer you don't feel invested in a 'journey' from the beginning of the film to the (unsatisfactory) ending. In my experience it's never a good sign when the writer considers it necessary to add a voice-over to the soundtrack, and here Affleck mutters truisms about his thoughts and motives that irritate more than illuminate.The sheer volume of players in the piece (there are about three film's worth in here) and the resulting minimal screen time given to each allows no time for character development. Unfortunately the result is that you really care very little about whether people live or die and big plot developments land as rather an ""oh"" than an ""OH!"".Affleck puts in a great turn as the autistic central character whose condition results in a cold, calculating demeanor and a complete lack of emotion reflecting on his face. Oh, hang on no, wait a minute sorry I've got the wrong film. I'm thinking about ""The Accountant"". I don't know whether he filmed these films in parallel. I generally enjoy Ben Affleck's work (he was excellent in ""The Town"") but for 95% of this film his part could have been completed by a burly extra with an Affleck mask on. In terms of acting range, his facial muscles barely get to a ""2"" on the scale. Given the double problem that he is barely credible as the ""young man"" returning mentally wounded from the trenches, then in my opinion he would have been better to have focused on the writing and directing and found a lead of the likes of an Andrew Garfield to fill Coughlin's shoes.That's not to say there is not some good acting present in their all but brief supporting roles. Elle Fanning (""Trumbo"", ""Maleficent"") in particular shines as the Southern belle Loretta Figgis: a religious zealot driving her police chief father (Chris Cooper, ""The Bourne Identity"") to distraction. Cooper also delivers a star turn as the moral but pragmatic law-man.Sienna Miller (""Foxcatcher"") delivers a passable Cork accent and does her best to develop some believable chemistry with the rock-like Affleck. Zoe Saldana (""Star Trek"") is equally effective as a Cuban humanitarian.In summary, it's sprawlingly watchable but overall a disappointment, with Affleck over-reaching. One day we surely will get a gangster film the likes of another ""Godfather"", ""Goodfellas"" or ""Untouchables"". Although this has its moments, unfortunately it's more towards the ""Public Enemies"" end of the genre spectrum.(For the graphical version of this review please visit bob-the-movie-man.com.

54,abisio,Affleck is an outstanding director,8,14 January 2017,"Live by Night is a somewhat atypical Gangster / Prohibition flick. The story is conventional; basically the rising of a criminal within the Mob (in this case, Irish, Italian and somewhat Cuban ) but Affleck is more interested in the racial and religious issues around the decades 1930 and 1940. The KKK is an important part of the plot as it is some religious movements on the South East (Florida to be precise).The director is able to create a few intense action scenes (some really very violent), an interesting recreation of those decades and very neat performances from a cast not that well known.If the movie fails somewhat is first on an script that could have been improved (perhaps it was an editing issue; the movie is 130 minutes and some scenes make the movie feel long).The second mistake is Affleck performance. There are many moments he did not look pretty convinced (something not good when he is also directing); however there are many moments he is right.In brief; an interesting and original gangster movie that do not disappoint",Live by Night
55,bryank-04844,"Eat, Drink, Sleep, and Live by Night.",5,23 January 2017,"I'm a big fan of Ben Affleck. When he stepped into the director's chair with 'Gone Baby Gone', he showed the world that he was one hell of a filmmaker that had a strong passion for cinema and how it's made. 'The Town' was also a gritty crime caper that was well shot with excellent performances, which paved the way for Affleck to twin the Oscar for his best directed film to date – 'Argo'. When it was announced that Affleck was going to write, direct, and star in 'Live By Night', a prohibition era gangster film with similarities to 'Goodfellas' and HBO's 'Boardwalk Empire', I was extremely excited, because Affleck had not led me astray with his films that he's directed so far.Based on the novel by Dennis LeHane ('Mystic River', 'Shutter Island', 'Gone Baby Gone'), 'Live By Night' has some great moments from start to finish, but does not have the grit, characters, or raw edge that so many gangster movies it tries to emulate had before it, which is why I'm fairly disappointed here. Affleck seems rote here as Joe Coughlin, the son of a good police chief (Brendan Gleeson) in Boston, who upon his return from the War, turns to a life of crime, specifically the robbery business. He works up enough of a name for himself to have meetings with the heads of the Irish Crime Family and the Italian Crime Family. After a botched robbery and people finding out about Joe's relationship with the Irish Mob boss' mistress (Sienna Miller), Joe is beaten and put in jail for three years.After this, Joe wants revenge on the Irish Mob boss, so he heads to Florida to run the Rum business for the Italians in hopes of getting revenge. Here we have Joe deal with some new characters, including the Police Chief of Tampa (Chris Cooper), his daughter (Elle Fanning), a relentless KKK member, and a cuban businesswoman (Zoe Saldana). While the Rum business is booming, Joe and the Italians want to build a casino in hopes of more money, which pits Joe and his right hand man (Chris Messina) between the Irish and Italian bosses in what Affleck hopes is something similar to a 'Godfather' like bloodbath.While the shots are setup nicely and the period pieces look amazing, there just isn't any real grit or edge to this film. Even Affleck looks strained in this role, never once changing his expression from a serious, gloomy man. As he weaves in and out of several story lines, the best of the characters are left by the way side, leaving us only to focus on Joe who again, is one note. Affleck does interject some humor here and there, but his character can't even be bothered to have any fun with it. Affleck mostly keeps the film and novel in check, but sometimes that is not the best adaptation, which is the case of the last ten minutes of 'Live By Night'.These last ten minutes are so thick with cheese, that it would only go well over a bed of nachos. That all being said, there is a lot to like here. The sets, the filming, and most of the performances are all well done, but the film just feels rushed, if not a bit lazy. Those who are fans of the gangster genre will want to give this a look though.WORTH A LOOK!",Live by Night
56,brankovranjkovic,Live by Night – less would have been more,6,19 January 2017,"I love a good gangster film, especially when Scorsese is directing (this one isn't). Set in the prohibition era of Boston, stars and is directed by Ben Afflek. His character is a small time bank robber who has a secret affair with one of the Irish mafia boss's girlfriend played by Sienna Miller. The girlfriend dies in a staged car accident, Afflek is wrongly imprisoned for the murder of a police officer – he vows to seek revenge and forms an allegiance with the Italian mafia. He rises the ranks and is transferred to Florida to run a bootlegging syndicate. While there he starts an interracial romance with Zoe Saldana's character. This is where the main plot and sub-plots become a little confused. Afflek finds himself in the middle of several simultaneous hostile situations, between The KKK, a religious movement and his growing empire. The film isn't all bad, the main plot is interesting, although jumps around the sub plots too much. The film would have been better if it had concentrated on one main plot. I'm sure that Scorsese would have focused on one particular theme and really wound up the level of grit. There are some good action sequences, especially the final shootout which is very 'Tarantino'. But the problem is that it just comes across rather confused.",Live by Night

Ben Affleck is very bad, I do not believe it at all. It is by far the worst of all.It's very well set, yes, but that's not enough to give you the strength you need to film. It has a great production, everything is believable as to what looks like those years, cars, clothing, but it is not enough.Photography is not bad, but it does not become good.The direction, is irregular, apart from everything discussed, is a sum of random, meaningless planes one after another every second, to give it a rhythm, when the rhythm of a film must be internal.

59,CANpatbuck3664,Live By Night is a Rock Solid Gangster Story,8,14 January 2017,"This movie checked off several boxes for me. I really enjoy gangster stories and this was a 1920s-1930s period piece (I think it's a really interesting era), so I was intrigued. Add in that Ben Affleck has been killing it as a director lately and I was in. The trailer was pretty great too, I was so jacked up for this I went and read Dennis Lehane's book (which was pretty great, I'll be reading more of his stuff in the future). It was one of those movies that was a must-see in the theatre for me. The bad reviews didn't deter me and I'm glad they didn't, expectations might have been too high for this and this movie accomplished what it wanted to.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Joe Coughlin (Ben Affleck) is back from WW1 and feels pretty dejected. The war had almost been pointless for him, he saw a lot of death and destruction and he's ready to enjoy his freedom and the good life even if it means dying for it. He gets back to his hometown of Boston and he begins his life as an outlaw.His situation is more complicated than most, it's not a good time to be running his own operation. The city is in the midst of a war between the Irish mob run by Albert White (Rob Glenister) and the Italian mafia run by Maso Pescatore (Remo Girone). Add in that his dad Thomas Coughlin (Brendan Gleeson) is a high ranking official in the Boston PD, so it's a volatile combination. One fateful day, he robs a backroom poker game with several high ranking officials in the Albert White mob in attendance with his 2 friends Dion (Chris Messina) and his brother. The waitress covering the game is Emma Gould (Sienna Miller) who was more than a little sly during the robbery. It's for good reason we find out, she's Joe's lover. But the events of that day turn the course of Joe's life toward a darker path that he can't escape.It's kind of cool to be writing this review from the point of view of knowing the source material pretty well. I'm happy to report that this movie is pretty faithful to the source material. A lot of the dialogue is ripped right out of the book. It changes certain parts of the story, mostly in the beginning and in the end but otherwise I was very impressed that Affleck and his team went so close to the book. There was a part of the story that I was disappointed they didn't include (robbing a U.S. naval vessel) but if one of my biggest criticisms is that they couldn't include every part of the awesome original narrative, that should show how stuffed the movie is with good bits. Some of the critics have complained about the pacing of the movie but I was never bored. There was always some new enemy or new problem Joe had to deal with and I wanted to know how Joe would figure out how to deal with them.The accurate translation of the book carries over into things like the cinematography, set-design, costumes and other visual parts. This is a beautiful movie. You would think I'm exaggerating because it's a gangster movie but the movie knows it, especially when they're in Florida. The movie has several absolutely beautiful shots of the Florida landscape and instead of distracting me from the central story, it actually enriched it. The last point I want to make about the visuals and directing is that Affleck really knows how to shoot the $#!& out of an action scene. The action is great in this movie in a gritty and fairly believable way. It's easy to see how Affleck's turned himself into one of the best directors out there in present time.Ben Affleck also put together a hell of a cast and minus one or two people, they all did good work. I actually didn't like Affleck as much as I thought I would in the first 1/3 of the movie, the character in the book is much younger and Affleck didn't quite seem to gel. But as the movie went along, the character grew and Affleck seemed to fit better. I was blown away by Sienna Miller, she was not only pitch-perfect as Emma but she nailed the Irish accent. Chris Messina brought some nice levity to the movie, he and Affleck played off each other very well. Veteran character actors like Brendan Gleeson and Chris Cooper were pretty solid. I liked Elle Fanning a lot better in this than the Neon Demon. I felt bad for Zoe Saldana as Graciela, she was pretty good but her character had a lot more depth in the book.The only other complaint I have about Live By Night is that the characterization was kind of uneven. I think that was mainly because they couldn't include everything from the book but it was still a small disappointment. Some of the characters didn't get their arcs, the biggest omissions were Graciela, Dion Bartolo and Esteban Suarez. I don't think this was neglectful by Affleck but there was a hatchet taken to the book and some of the parts that were cleaved were little parts that could have made the movie better.I think the critics have been too hard on this movie. It's not as good as the Godfather, Goodfellas or The Town but it's a well put together gangster movie. I would compare it in quality to Black Mass, the 2015 Johnny Depp movie. That movie had a better central performance but I think this had better production values, a story with better flow and better action scenes. If you like gangster movies or Dennis Lehane's novel, check this out. In terms of Affleck's output, The Town was better but this is still well above your typical January release.",Live by Night
60,Java_Joe,It's Affleck all the way down.,4,22 September 2018,"I'll be the first to admit I don't particularly like Ben Affleck. To my knowledge the only movie I liked him in was ""Shakespeare in Love"" because he essentially played himself. Namely a pompous actor who believed he was great. And throughout it all that never really changed. I'd watch a movie with Ben Affleck and I just saw Ben Affleck. Other characters while I'd recognize the actor at least had some characterization about them. Not Ben. He's always been Ben.And then came Argo which I still didn't like but he captured the Oscar and suddenly we found out what Ben had wanted to do all this time. His passion project. Namely, ""Live by Night"".Up until now he directed, or wrote or produced movies but he wasn't alone. He had other people to bounce ideas off or he had other points of view to look at. Here? It's pure Affleck and it shows.He wrote, directed, produced and starred in what he hoped would be another blockbuster that would propel him into the ranks of other writer, director, producer, actors. But sadly such was not for him because Ben Affleck can't go it alone. In the end we're left with a story that feels thin and just doesn't have the weight of crime movies like The Godfather or Pulp Fiction. It just feels like it's meandering it's way on autopilot. The movie feels rudderless. Although we do get a lot of dramatic closeups of Ben's face. Was that a stylistic choice or just Ben feeding his own ego? Who knows. All I know is that this really wasn't he movie for me.",Live by Night
61,PyroSikTh,"Not Affleck's Best, but still Pretty Good",7,17 January 2017,"Ben Affleck, after having some ups and downs in the blockbuster world, has made a massive, celebrated name for himself behind the camera, and in truth has been able to bring out some of his best performances as an actor as well. He steadily scored a perfect three for three with Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and Argo. Need I explain my interest in Live By Night any further? Unfortunately critics have been overly harsh. Is this Affleck's worst movie? Yeah, probably, but that's not saying much when his other three have been highly-acclaimed award winners.Live By Night is a prohibition-era gangster movie, complete with every trope and cliché of the genre, and yet it does dare to tread some slightly new ground simultaneously. We follow Joe Coughlin, son of a Police Chief, who's wrapped up in a gang war in Boston between the Irish and Italians over the distribution of Rum. He begrudgingly teams up with the Italians in order to get back at the Irish, who have moved their operations to the source; in Florida. The warmer, swampier, more exotic setting is one of Live By Night's most refreshing changes, and it lends itself to other new aspects as well.Once you place prohibition gangsters in the south, they start brushing shoulders with the overly religious and deeply racist. What starts as a war between two crime bosses soon becomes a war between gangsters and the KKK, and trying to keep their business running amidst the pressures of a church that wants to chase out their sins. Joe Coughlin's rise to power stands out from every other rise to power in gangster movies, because he has to contend with more than the average gangster in these movies does.But one key way Live By Night falters is in it's treatment of characters. The focus is on Joe, and it seems only Joe. A lot happens during his tenure, and he comes up against many foes and allies alike, but their development is merely scratched at the surface, which is frustrating considering how many of these secondary and tertiary characters seem really interesting. First and foremost is his eventual wife; sister to and co- partner of the Cuban operations. When she's first introduced, it's implied she'll be quite important to Joe and his story, not least because of her interesting position in the operation, but also due to her skin colour in those times. And yet she's very much on the outskirts. Every line she speaks, and every action she does, is in order to develop Joe's character rather than her own. This criticism extends to Joe's right- hand man Dion, his Boston lover Emma, local Police Chief Figgis, his daughter Loretta, and the two mob bosses Maso Pescatore and Albert White. Each and every one of these characters is interesting, and yet I don't feel I know much about any of them.Sub-plots suffer this fate as well. I often found myself wondering what the point of certain sub-plots were, only to then discover that they were fairly essential to the development of the Joe's story, and you couldn't have one without the other, without it's roots extended from another. For instance, as great as the conflict is, I wondered what the point of dealing with the KKK was, but it intrinsically links in with the story of Loretta. What was the point of the conflict between Joe and Loretta? Again, without it the end would lose it's profundity. Too much focus on these other characters may well have given each individual sub-plot a bit more of their own place in the story, but they would also have muddled it up greatly without extending the movie into a mini-series length TV show. Okay, that's not really a good excuse. A Live By Night TV show would certainly have felt more fulfilling than cramming it all in to two hours.Okay, so Affleck's writing was the movie's biggest sin, but thankfully it was the only sin. Affleck plays Joe with a tortured depth between doing the right thing, but being stuck in a business of wrong things. Every decision he makes, and every manipulation, blackmail and bribe he commits is met with regret. ""I'm sad you've made me do this"" he says on a couple of occasions. Sienna Miller offers possibly the best performance I've ever seen from her, appearing more natural and at ease than any other performance she's offered. Her Irish accent is maybe a little overdone, but not noticeably bad, and she treats her character with a veneer throughout, hiding her true intentions. Elle Fanning is brilliant as Loretta, even though, like everyone who isn't Affleck, she's under-utilised. Her scenes stick out though for the unexpected power and dominance she exhibits. Her conviction to the role as palpable. Brendan Gleeson, Zoe Saldana, Chris Messina, and Chris Cooper all suffer from not enough screen time, only able to hint at how interesting their characters are.So is Live By Night Affleck's worst movie? Yes. But is Live By Night a generally bad movie? No, not even remotely. It's writing and character development begs improvement, but the story is thoroughly engaging from beginning to end, the action entertaining and fun to watch, and the acting top quality from everyone involved. I enjoyed my time at the cinema even if many professional critics didn't, maybe because they had heightened expectations considering Affleck's track record. I give Live By Night a genuinely quite good 7/10.",Live by Night
62,ClaytonDavis,'Live By Night' Has Luscious Looks That Can't Save Its Numbing Plot,4,19 February 2017,"With an impressive trio of films that any working director would be lucky to have on their résumé, Ben Affleck has proved to be a powerful force in Hollywood. Winning an Original Screenplay Oscar for 1997's masterpiece ""Good Will Hunting"" with pal Matt Damon, he returned to the ceremony in 2012 for his Best Picture-winning ""Argo."" His newest outing ""Live By Night,"" in which he also stars and adapts the Dennis Lehane novel, is the filmmaker's first career misfire behind the camera.Thoroughly ambitious in its technical construction, Affleck has a handle on capturing a time and paying homage to old Hollywood movies, but has very little control of its narrative sensibilities and what keeps an audience invested in a movie. While ""Live By Night"" is surely stylish, and features a set of terrific performances, it's deprived of inspiration and misplaced in a year that was full of it.""Live By Night"" is a story that is set in the Prohibition Era and centered around a group of individuals and their dealings in the world of organized crime. At the center of it is Joe Coughlin (played by Affleck), whose own moralities are tested by family, friends, and both past and present love interests.Affleck's ambitions are on full display. He chases the classics such as ""Chinatown"" and ""L.A. Confidential,"" as well as modern-day classics, but comes up short in almost every regard. Characters are sorely underdeveloped, even down to Joe Coughlin himself. Despite being structured as a crime epic, it's staggering how little we know about Joe, and how little we care. Affleck focuses on nodding towards nostalgia rather than reinventing it. Visually, the film is quite impressive, but on all other fronts, it nearly drags its audience through a muddy swamp that probably sounds more interesting than the toothless tale that was told.There are quite a few positives to take away. First and foremost, the outstanding and bountiful turn from Chris Messina stands as one of the year's most undervalued turns. He makes the most of every moment he's given, while interpreting the sidekick role like nothing we've seen over the last few years.Jess Gonchor's vivacious production design in partnership with Jacqueline West's fiery costumes place us right in the time. Editor William Goldenberg, who won the Academy Award for ""Argo,"" makes poor choices in trying to put together a story so that it doesn't feel like a 12-hour mini-series. The action sequences are well put together, but we have to credit the sound teams for their impeccable work. DP Robert Richardson's lighting and lens choices give the film its 1920s-era feel, but if it can't match an equally inventive script, then there's little we can get excited about.All the women in the film feel like they're from a different movie and stumbled onto the set. Sienna Miller's inconsistent accent, littered with her facial expressions that look like she was plucked out of Tim Burton's ""Batman,"" have her delivering some of her worst choices to date. A talent is being wasted and we need a more challenging director to save her.Zoe Saldana is shoehorned, not only in character but in just mere existence in the picture. From inception to exit, it would take a miracle for anyone to repeat her story arc and what she offered in terms of progression and motivation.Elle Fanning, who just knocks everything she touches out of the park, is solidly invested in her Loretta Figgis, a born again Christian causing a stir. While she has a great exchange with Affleck in one scene in particular, it's too little too late for us to get wrapped in her luscious words.The appetite of ""Live By Night"" is welcomed in any landscape of cinema, but in the wake of many filmmakers and studios raising the conventions of what a movie is these days, the film is simply decades too late. It's misjudged with unclear villains and a misshapen story. Audiences may mildly enjoy it but quickly forget it by end credits.GRADE: (★★)",Live by Night
63,gsygsy,Unfulfilled promise,5,5 January 2017,"Producer, director, writer and lead actor: Ben Affleck.Let's look at those contributions one by one.Producer. The film looks good. There's an expert team on both sides of the camera. But there's a problem with length. Also, it feels as though the adaptation from Dennis Lehane's novel has not sufficiently transformed what was on the page into cinematic story-telling.Director. There are excellent action sequences, such as an exciting car-chase and a final shoot-out. As a director of actors Mr Affleck is strong: he elicits particularly striking work from Chris Messina, Elle Fanning, Remo Girone and Sienna Miller. Within scenes there's a reassuring sense of control of pace. But overall, there is a sense of the director being in thrall to the screenplay.Writer. This is the weakest link. It feels in awe of its source material. I read that an entire strand of the book was removed for the purposes of the film, but this was not enough. The producer and/or the director needed to tell the writer to put it through another draft. Or put it in its current form on Netflix as a two-part drama.Lead actor. A matter of taste, I guess. Mr Affleck's persona is always of a handsome man who knows he's handsome, and who is very pleased with himself about it. I find this insufferable in large doses. And there is a very large dose of it here. Mr Affleck's performances lack depth -- compare and contrast those of this amazing brother Casey. As far as I'm concerned, Mr B. Affleck is more a male model than an actor: in James Bond terms, he's a George Lazenby rather than a Daniel Craig. His best film performance is his self-parodying turn in 'SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE'. In LIVE BY NIGHT he is serviceable, nothing more. His director clearly couldn't get anything else out of him.It's instructive to compare Ben Affleck to Clint Eastwood, who also has a limited -- maybe even more limited -- range as an actor. But Eastwood the director usually casts Eastwood the actor brilliantly. DIRTY HARRY, UNFORGIVEN,GRAN TORINO etc: who could be better? By contrast, there are many young actors who could have played the lead in LIVE BY NIGHT, and many writers who could have delivered a better screenplay, especially when guided by a strong producer and director. Time will tell whether Ben Affleck is as good in those last two departments as ARGO suggested he might be. The promise he showed in those areas in that film is not in evidence here.",Live by Night
64,dcarsonhagy,"I've Seen that Movie, Too",3,23 March 2017,"**SPOILER ALERT**Ben Affleck fails to deliver anything in his latest film, ""They Live By Night."" A story about prohibition, the 1920s, crosses, double crosses, and triple crosses, yet there is hardly one interesting aspect to this film. There is nothing original at all here, just the same recycled story line we've all seen a dozen times.Affleck gives you characters you really do not care about, and if that weren't bad enough, fails to touch on story lines which would have made his picture better. His on-screen romance with Zoe Saldana was completely unbelievable, and when she dies--and you know this is inevitable--he manages to muster a look of constipation instead of pain. The action sequences seemed contrived as well as uninteresting.Rated ""R"" for lots of bloodless violence, brief nudity, and language.",Live by Night
65,gavinp9,OK gangster/vengeance film,6,2 January 2018,"'Live By Night' (FYI, ""live"" as in 'liv', not 'lie-ve' - ""sleep by day, live by night"") is the fourth film Ben Affleck's directed (after 'Gone Baby Gone', 'The Town' and 'Argo'), and sadly it's my least favourite of his. That's not to say it's bad, since he's a better director than he is an actor, but that's where the problem lies - it's quite hard to truly warm to his character, Joe, in this. I wish he'd cast other people as leads, like in 'Gone Baby Gone'. It's set in 1920's prohibition-era Boston (where else), but he eventually relocates to Tampa, Florida, to run the rum trade for the Italian gang.The start's OK, but needed more of his father (Gleeson), as he gets caught between the Irish and Italian mobs. Joe meets Graciela (Salanda) in Tampa and falls in love and has to put up with the KKK calling him and her all sorts of things, but that's eventually sorted - the film doesn't really delve too much into the racial implications of things. Joe & Dion (Messina), his trusty off-sider, meet the police Chief (Cooper) and his daughter, Loretta (Fanning), which has implications later on. The main plot centres on Joe & Dion trying to branch into the gambling/casino business and the hurdles they face. There's a tale of vengeance in there, plus a cautionary tale of not losing yourself while trying to be someone you're not and all the while you still feel a little bit of ""why do I care?"" There are some great fly-over scenery/sunset shots in Florida, and a decent ending, but it all feels a bit too dragged out (130min, when it could've easily wrapped up after 105min) with no real connection or purpose made. The set design and cars are certainly cool and of the era, but the shootouts never seem enough or to have enough at stake.",Live by Night
66,thebricks,Much better than the critics said it was,9,21 August 2017,"Had very low expectations for this, but it was a lot better than I thought it would be. Definitely one of my favorite gangster films, up there with things like Layer Cake. I kept waiting for it to get bad, wear out its welcome, but it was soundly made. My favorite part was the car chase, well done, with 30's era cars. That was a nice change of pace.",Live by Night
67,kaptenvideo-89875,Goodfella that wants to be good,7,23 January 2017,"Do you remember? Ben Affleck's breakthrough came alongside then-BFF Matt Damon, starring in ""Good Will Hunting"" (1997) for which they both also won Academy Award for best original screenplay.Affleck's career hasn't been as chock-full of rock solid movies as Damon's but he's still a fine actor and some would say he's even better as director. He won his second Academy Award for directing ""Argo"" (2013) but his first works in this field, ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Town"", are really good also.""Live by Night"" is probably meant as Affleck's magnum opus, with him directing, starring and adapting another Dennis Lehane's novel (after ""Gone Baby Gone"").It's a good-looking, majestic, violent and slowburning mafia drama taking place in 1920-30's USA, from Boston to Florida. In a good way, it's really reminiscent of such great classics as ""The Godfather"" and ""Scarface"". Sometimes it feels more like the former, the other times the latter. But the result is not just me-too-project because mafia dramas are cool. The ambitions have been higher.Affleck is careful to build up the authentic setting and let characters have enough depth to make us actually care. Like in good TV series, he takes his time creating the atmosphere but also offering enough brutal bloodletting to keep the more impatient viewer satisfied.There's no serious problem with the result... but ""Live by Night"" is too traditional. It's like re-watching your favorite mafia epics – from recent stuff, I'd recommend HBO's ""Boardwalk Empire"" – but with a big helping of sad-faced Affleck. It's all good but not so fresh anymore. What's worse, these days many of the other screen stories about criminals offer this kind of experiences too. You can enjoy comparable quality, from Netflix's ""Luke Cage"", for example. Americans really know how to put together stuff like this, and they have done so many times, which doesn't work for Affleck's favor.On the other hand, if you haven't seen enough of this kind of stuff, ""Live by Night"" offers everything the genre fan needs: good story, exciting action, convincing characters, really good cast of actors... Affleck fills the lead and has the most amount of screen time. There are also Sienna Miller and Zoe Saldana as two of his biggest loves, Brendan Gleeson as his father, plus various interesting characters played by Chris Cooper, Elle Fanning, Miguel (yes, that R&B star), Matthew Maher, Chris Messina... I didn't just list a bunch of actors here, all of them impressed me with their performances and colorful characters. ""Live by Night"" may not be super gripping story-wise but it sure does have a lot of cool actors in memorable roles. Considering how many movie makers just seem to waste the acting talent they have been given, it surely must count for something.I enjoyed how there's something interesting nuance or detail about each and every major character. For example, the lead man doesn't just want to be gangster and chooses to see himself just an outlaw. His priority is to be his own man and he dislikes violence, choosing the diplomatic way whenever possible. For most of the time, he even questions if he's cruel enough to hold this position of power he has gained. You will remember him as sad, haunted man locked between two worlds, never quite achieving neither peace nor freedom he seems to want so much.That may not be all that original but mafia epics don't usually offer this kind of depth, outside of TV world.",Live by Night
68,srdjan_veljkovic,"The story is OK with some good moments, but everything else - not so much",5,4 February 2017,"It comes down to Ben Affleck just not being a good enough director for such a movie. Well, at least not yet. There are so many things that are missing here, so many lost opportunities. When you see things that happen in this movie, it should get you involved, make you care about these characters. But, you don't.It's like looking at a good, but inexperienced cook, at work. He knows how to cook, he knows the main ingredients, does his job, but... it's the little things, the tricks of the trade, the seasoning, if you will, that's not there. Thus the end result is OK, but it's not really good.Although it is a rather different take on it, it's the same basic plot as ""Scarface"", with the same general dynamics. In that comparison one can see the main flaws of ""Live by Night"". Ben Affleck's character is a better man than Al Pacino's, yet, by the end, you care about Al Pacino, and don't care about Ben Affleck. The final showdown in Scarface is emotionally packed, not just because of the tragic end. The final showdown of Live by Night is mostly dull, not just because of the happy ending. There are many such differences, as you compare a master chef (Brian De Palma) to a journeyman (Ben Affleck).Of course, some political agenda that is being pushed here also doesn't help. Nor the usual Affleck's expressionless performance. Nor the usual lack of chemistry between him and his leading ladies. But, these things don't carry a lot of weight here, one could move past them. It's the above mentioned main problems that make this a not-really-good movie.",Live by Night
69,trublu215,"A frustrating film that is well intended and, at times, thrilling but never reaches what it aspires to be.",5,21 December 2016,"Live By Night tells the story of gangster Joe Coughlin (Ben Affleck) as he rises, falls then rises again through the criminal underworlds of Boston and Miami. Chronicling his life throughout the prohibition era in America, Joe becomes involved in the most nefarious of situations. He survives a bank heist gone wrong in which a police officers winds up dead, he survives a long stint in prison caused by the betrayal of his femme fatale Emma (Sienne Miller), he goes through so much in the film that you start to wonder less about what is going to happen than as to why it is happening. This is a film that feels incomplete, rushed and all together shallow. Ben Affleck, who has given us some pretty incredible films up until now, shows his weaknesses as a screenwriter but continues to give us more than enough to chew when it comes to his direction.While I did want more out of this film, there is no denying that Affleck can most certainly stage some breathtaking action sequences. He knows when to get close, he knows what to show and when to show it. Live By Night is no exception to that standard in regards to how everything is shown. Some major highlights of the film include a vicious car chase through a country back road, copious amounts of bloody shootouts and brutal fights throughout yet we feel disengaged by what is going on. We don't know enough about anyone in the film outside of Joe to be connected to them, let alone feel bad when someone dies. To be quite honest, the film is 128 minutes and has about 100 characters in it...none of which you end up caring about. This comes down on the shoulders of Affleck as a screenwriter. In many ways, the film plays out like a highlight reel to a HBO mini-series such as Boardwalk Empire. It never really lets us simmer in slow burn human drama and instead gives us an action packed gangster film that is more on the level of Gangster Squad than White Heat. If there is one thing that I've grown to expect going into a Ben Affleck film, it is that I'm bound to be blown away by the cast if all else fails. While the performances in this film are good, some of them even excellent, it really doesn't translate well when you just don't care about them. Ironically, in a film that is geared towards male characters and dominated by such, the women in this film give tremendous performances. Sienna Miller and Zoe Saldana stand out as two performances that were truly powerhouse even if their screen time collectively added up to maybe twenty minutes all together.Then there is Chris Messina, who was a bit hard to judge here, considering he is playing a character from the 1930s underworld, but it was extremely hard to take him seriously during times when you wanted nothing more than to be able to take him seriously. At first, I figured he was the comic relief but then I was left waiting for him to drop the act and be serious for a moment. While I know Messina is a phenomenal actor, I just could not take him seriously in this role. Unfortunately, I thought he was too over the top. No matter what my thoughts on Messina were, he still did not compare to how I felt about Ben Affleck's performance as Joe.While I am a big fan of Ben Affleck, I was severely let down by his performance in this film. I've read about the differences between the film and the novel regarding the age and honestly, I don't really care about that. The film is the film and the book is the book. That isn't my issue here. My issue is how wooden Affleck went to portray Joe. There was nothing new, nothing deep about this character which is pretty disappointing considering both The Town and Gone Baby Gone had tremendous lead characters that made us care about what happens to them. Unfortunately, this isn't the case here. This film does very little to make us care about any character, let alone our lead. Many will argue that watching a criminal empire get built is fascinating no matter how many times we see it, and I agree with that. But when you have someone as uninteresting as Joe Coughlin, something that is supposed to be fun to watch turns into a chore. That is probably the most frustrating thing about this film.Overall, Live by Night is a throwback to classical gangster films that serves as Ben Affleck's worst directorial effort. With that being said, the film still features some truly thrilling action sequences that are bound to satisfy many even if the film is a bloated mess that should have been larger than what is or nothing at all.",Live by Night

Mafia boss Maso Pescatore sends him down to Florida to set up a profitable business only to find our hero botching up his job which leads to bloodshed and a swift turn of events. Supporting Affleck is the ever reliable Brendan Gleeson as his father, sour-faced Chris Cooper as the patriarch to the charming Elle Fanning who portrays a religious zealot who gets in the way.

It took me a while to get really invested in, it even feels a little rushed at points, especially for the first 40 minutes or so, but the second half of the film makes up for it, with amazing and intense scenes that are some of the best in recent mafia cinema, some of the acting may feel a little clunky, but nothing that will take you out of the movie, because the acting it's great for the most part.I would recommend the film, but don't expect this to be a great movie, at least, not until a director's cut it's released, but as it is now, it's still very good.",Live by Night
73,Lewis_Heather787,Not Affleck's best film but still a good one!,7,14 January 2017,"Ben Affleck is one of the most underrated and harshly criticised people in the film industry, whether that be his acting , writing or directing. I personally can't see why so many people have a problem with his work, personally for me his is one of the best working today. The title of this review may make you think this a poor film, no not at all, its just not as good as some of his previous work.No matter what you think of him or about this film you have to give credit to Affleck for not only direct this film but writing it and starring as the lead character. It shows how much he really cared for the project and that he had a clear vision for what he anted it to look like on the screen. His acting in the film is good he portrays a relatable ""outlaw"" who is just trying to get on with his life and gets immersed in the Irish and Italian mob world. He makes you feel great empty for the character and a willing for the character to succeed in all of his ventures whether they be good or bad ill intentioned with is amazing how that is done. The script by Affleck as well is also good has elements of humour where there needed and are not overused especially in film like this which is mainly darkish. The dialogue between characters can be tense and meaningful at times and then heartfelt and emotional the next. There is a really good balance of emotion in the dialogue at any given seen or time in the film and is a testament to Affleck's talent. Then there is the directing of the film which is also good by Affleck, I could be wrong but this is his most adventurous project so far. What I mean by that is the scope of this film which is far greater than Argo, The Town or Gone Baby Gone. The action and the production design of the film is immaculate from start to finish, this attention to detail and scope all begins with Affleck's vision, he deserves a lot of credit for taking on such a huge undertaking with the film.The Cast as a whole excluding Affleck were all good as well, from the more well established actors like Sienna Miller, Chis Cooper and Brendan Gleeson to the more surprising ones is Elle Fanning. All of the them gave good performances all of which you could understand there motives of what they are doing in the film. From the harshness of Brendan Gleeson as Affleck's father, being this overbearing cop who doesn't care what his son gets up to but that he must pay the consequences. Sienna Miller playing this sweet woman who has also been engulfed by the mob world and wants to deserted escape from it, she is the heart of the film for the short amount of time she is in it. Chris Cooper is always dependable actor and much like Affleck extremely underrated he never has a bad performance. The bigger surprise of the film is Fanning, she is the emotional heart of the second half of the film. Fanning going from a chief of polices's sweetheart daughter who would become a movie star to a fanatical religious speaker. It shows a fantastic range to her talent and should definitely great better roles if she's does this more often. The final action scene of the film is truly brilliant, fantastically shot and choreographed. Heart pounding from star to finish and is a real call back to old mobster films this is the best part of the film and something that should be praised about, brilliant from Affleck.Lastly there are some negatives of the film, I believe that the film can now and then get a bit sluggish and can be quite slow in moving from one story line to another. All the story itself can be a bit to slow and then all of a sudden really fast during the action scenes, it doesn't work all the time unfortunately. Its not as good as Argo, The Town or Gone Baby Gone but is a fine achievement by Affleck and shows the diversity in his work. It does nothing to damper his talent but it also doesn't increase it either really, 70 % out of 100 its a good film with good performances all round with really good action scenes. It can sometimes though can fall a little flat but its worth going to see, still gives me confidence in Ben Affleck directing, acting and writing a Batman film!",Live by Night

'Live by Night' had everything to be great period piece, but it all fell flat. The pacing was slow and the tone was unbalanced (like Ben Affleck's performance). The cinematography was fantastic, and set pieces looked beautiful. Actually too beautiful, everything looked like brand new, the film could have used little more grittiness and tiredness to look more authentic for the period. Ben Affleck has never been the greatest actor alive, but here his performance was too unfocused, even the rich supporting cast with many great character actors all looked bored.

I didn't feel Ben was convincing as a ruthless scarface gangster with a suit two sizes too big he looked comical , OK he says he doesn't want to be one , he certainly got his wish ! On the positive side , the cinematography was good ,some beautiful scenic shots , the recreation of the prohibition Boston and Florida was very good . Technically the film is good , the script and casting let it down together with the length and lack of passion. This was close to 5/10 but I never felt drawn in so that when a character died I felt no emotion towards that on screen death despite the film asking me to do so .

79,SpoilerAlertReviews,Starts off amazingly well over to drift off.,7,30 January 2017,"Ben Affleck has a pretty impressive directorial catalogue already, with Gone Baby Gone, The Town and the Oscar winning Argo. All films I consider of good calibre, slick and riveting. Now, he points the camera at a period gangster piece set mostly in the southern state of Florida during the prohibition of America. It's based of a novel by Dennis Lehane, a criminal thriller mastermind who also penned The Drop, Gone Baby Gone, Shutter Island and my personal favourite, Mystic River. So, we can expect a good level of thoughtful drama, especially when throwing in the mob.Affleck takes the lead as Joe Coughlin, a part Leonardo DiCaprio was original considered to play but dropped to producer only. Coughlin, a judicious and often deceitful small time criminal undertaking heists and robberies in 1920's Boston. Trying to carve something of his own after fighting in the war, he instead comes home to get caught up in a very different war, between the Italian mafioso and the Irish mob. But it doesn't stay in Boston very long and business ends up going south where he makes new alliances and foes, and this is where the story goes from gangland to romance and politics. It's starts off notoriously well and sets you up for something greater only to fall short towards the end. The performances are good but I found Affleck to be the weakest of them all, it's not his best out of his recent pictures. I don't think he was cruel enough, he wasn't as menacing and calculating as I might imagine, but then, maybe that's just it and he nailed it. It's Chris Cooper that's steals the show with a strong emotional performance as not-so-corrupt police chief Figgis. It's well shot and has some great camera work but there's nothing outstanding apart from the Boston takedown. The finale was a let down for me, I was expecting more, like a shoot-out similar to The Untouchables. It does in fact, whilst being fairly original, shares some attractive characteristics from other stories like Scarface, and I couldn't help but think there's a strong Count of Monte Cristo feel to the story. The other key elements of the film is brilliant, the sets and locations, especially the vintage Boston arenas and the automobiles, the costume design and Harry Gregson-Williams' score is of a high standard, however, on the soundtrack, nothing outstanding or memorable. Unfortunately, it's a story that starts off so well, teasing to lead on to something great but slopes down to romance and business deals that falls flat at the very end. Not saying it's a bad film, because it isn't, but I found the character of Coughlin, much like the last half of the film, very underwhelming. It's certainly not Affleck's best work in my opinion. I would much rather rewatch The Town and Agro over this.

80,rutzelb,Very Good,9,3 April 2017,"Joe Coughlin (Ben Affleck) is the son of a Police Captain, and engages in petty crimes and he prefers to call himself an Outlaw, not a gangster. He was playing with fire going with Emma (Sienna Miller) who is the girl friend of crime boss Albert White (Robert Gnenister). He gets caught in a job gone wrong, spends some time in jail and later finds out that Emma had died in car accident. When he gets out of jail, he is hired by the rival crime boss Maso (Remo Girone) to be his guy in Tampa, Florida supplying Rum. Joe has some troubles in Florida with the Cubans who were dealing with Albert White's crew, the KKK and with religious sentiment against the casino Joe wants to build. This got much better after Joe goes to Tampa, Florida. We see him grooving with his new gangster life and we like this side of him. The local Sheriff Chief Figgis (Chris Cooper) knows all that Joe is about and allows Joe to operate only in certain sections of Tampa. Problems arise when Maso comes to Florida to find out why his casino isn't being built. Oh, oh!Notables: Elle Fanning as Lorreta Figgis, who becomes instrumental in the fight against Joe's casino; Chris Messina as Dion Bartolo, Joe's trusted second in command; Miguel as Esteban Suarez the head of the Cubans; and Zoe Saldana as Graciela, Miguel's co-worker and Joe's new love interest. The fight scenes with guns and car chase scenes are very good. Yes, we see those Classic cars of the 1920s and 1930s. The acting all around is excellent.There is a twist, sort of, later on but it doesn't amount to anything. It's just something that we were led to believe to be true and come to find out later it is not true. That's all I got.Since Ben Affleck sometimes uses a Bostonian accent in here, I got to thinking that he could very well play the new Bond, James Bond. A British accent isn't that hard to do and it doesn't have to be used all the time as we noticed that the previous Bonds, James Bonds didn't always spout the accent. Only at times. Think about it. Okay, okay then there is Will Smith, right? Think about both. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, but nothing is seen. Nudity: Yes in photographs. Language: Yes.",Live by Night
81,cdjh-81125,There Was Once A Great Movie Here,7,18 August 2017,"I haven't seen Gone Baby Gone for many years but when I did see it I don't remember being to fond of it but since then I have been consistently blown away by his work as a director so I was incredibly excited for Live By Night and while it was far from what I hoped I didn't find the nearly as poor as some critics.Like all Affleck's movies this film looks stunning, the production design is immaculate and definitely took inspiration from other films of its type in the best possible way. As always Ben Affleck directed this movie very well the action all feels smooth and real, he uses a lot of single takes instead of constantly cutting away which made it feel very sleek and smooth.The first act of this movie is definitely its best, very atmospheric this was when Coughlin was at his most interesting when he was simply a back robber with nothing of a moral code, it also has the most action of all the acts which simply makes it more entreat this point. The last act picks up the slack and ends in a classic shootout that felt built up very well. The acting is solid here, nothing Oscar worthy as I was hoping but good nonetheless. Ben Affleck fits into the part very well while I could see others play his character but it did feel as if he made the character his own. Elle Fanning is very good here very damaged and conflicted which allows her to nail some very emotional scenes. Sienna Miller isn't in the movie much but had very good chemistry with Ben Affleck when she did appear. Zoe Saldana is fine but didn't have a lot of to her and I didn't like her romance with Affleck.This film has a lot of flaws however, most of them come from the second act, it is very dull, I didn't care for most of the new characters who were introduced, the setting wasn't nearly as interesting as it was in the first act and as I said the romance that blooms between Affleck and Saldanas characters didn't do much for me.Another big issue with this movie was that it relied to heavily on dialogue to tell its story, I'm not opposed to a film that's dialogue driven but in a gangster film you need to back words up with actions and this film rarely did that doing more telling than showing. It was also tragic that it made large stretches of this film very boring because they don't make anything we see with our own eyes come of it.Live By Night is by no means a bad movie it's just very disappointing that it is also nowhere near as good as it could have been. This film is directed well, acted mostly well and has some very good action sequences. It's unfortunate that it falls into the pattern of show don't tell and rarely really grabbed me mostly due to its second act. I haven't lost faith in Affleck as a director but I hope he makes a considerably better film in his next directorial effort.7.3/10: B (Solid)",Live by Night

83,douglasmcbroom,Hacked To Death!,5,11 October 2021,"I remember when I first saw Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon A Time In America' how utterly disappointed I was. It made no sense. Years later, I learned that the 2 hour film that The Ladd Company, in association with Warner Brothers, insisted upon (because they knew much more about film making than Sergio Leon) was actually a 3 hour and 50 minute film that was re-released at the original length. When I saw that film, I understood and greatly admired it. I read that the film Affleck made was a 3 hour film, but Warner Brothers insisted on a 2 hour version. So, it is possible that there is a very good 3 hour film here, but the 2 hour version is a mess.Affleck is a very good director and a very good writer. Dennis Lahane is an outstanding writer so it's difficult to believe they got this so wrong, hence my optimism that the original version is much better. The film looks terrific.However, acting wise, Affleck pretty much sleep walks through the film and leaves the heavy lifting to the excellent supporting cast. Affleck even looks washed out.Perhaps some day, they may release the film Affleck actually made and we can judge it fairly.",Live by Night

Bem is becoming more and more the master of understated. He's really hard not to like and his actors seem to be giving their best. I would give this movie a 10 but, If I watch a movie to the end, it's usually a good one and I give them 10's because they deserve it...I gave an eight because it's not perfect...Few things are.

Well, the only positive thing I can say are the beautiful set pieces. Everything else totally stunk. Its definitely no classic, and doesn't even come remotely close to The Town.It seems like Ben is in love with himself, as he's in almost every scene, mumbling his lines. He gives Steven Seagal a run for his money for most soft spoken. Affleck is boring, the pace moves at the speed of a turtle, all the other actors only gets a few scenes and none of them are memorable. The love scenes lack passion and worst of all, the violence lacks excitement. It has the most dullest shootouts of any gangster movie I can recall. I couldn't wait for this movie to end.I don't know what happened with Ben, as he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in it, but he didn't bring his A game, he brought his P (pathetic) game instead.",Live by Night
86,thor2029,"Live by night - a very good movie ""gangsters / mafia"" with a superb Ben Affleck.",9,23 March 2017,"My opinion---Boston Massachusetts 1926, the 1920s are roaring, alcohol is flowing, balls are flying, and a man tries to stand out and stand out in this world of violence where even seduction and love with a certain Romanticism will also be the seductive partners of the film, without harming the scenario. Ben Affleck's superb achievement for me was a success, for even if the script is not original, he was able to give a personal signature to his film, with this Irish mafia against the Italian mafia, with all his actions Which will take place between Boston at the beginning and then in Tampa, Florida. This film has been extremely well realized here and acknowledge that with the contribution of all this beautiful reconstruction of the 1920s, the smallest detail has been cared for and gives a plus to the film. As for Ben Affleck actor, (is still such a handsome man) he was really great in his role, I adored him. The film is treated and its realization is fair and consistent, the film allows itself to be seen without problem, because in this period of end of the American prohibition, one can notice that it was most turbulent in the middle of the underworld. The scenes of the film are linked well and its reading is more than correct, it is true that in this milieu violence is often present and it is almost the daily life of all these mafiosi, whose film makes very well all Those moments when death occurs as brutal and sharp. There are excellent action sequences, such as an exciting vintage car chase (very successful) and a memorable final shooting scene. We must first say that we look at a film for its pleasure and not to try to find faults to be able to criticize every time, we like or we do not like is the real reason for the cinema. I loved this film, the way it was made and conducted, a nice reading of the script make the film go smoothly, good actors and a great Ben Affleck, made that the film is of its kind A very good film to discover.",Live by Night
87,Willie-12,Not Bad...But Not Even Close To Affleck's Previous Work,6,8 March 2017,"Ben Affleck has already made his way into the elite status when it comes to directors. His previous work has illustrated that truth. Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and Argo...all superbly done...all deserving of the acclaim they garnered. And so it would seem that the streak could not last forever. Mere odds would tell one that eventually Affleck is going to miss. And miss he does here with his latest effort behind and in front of the camera. Now don't get me wrong. This is not a bad movie. Not by a long shot. It is a near miss, but a miss nonetheless. LBN is the type of movie that a director like Affleck has the right to make. He's already shown us brilliance. And an abundance of it at that. So he deserves a film like LBN. It's obvious this is a film that he's wanted to make for quite some time now. It is clear that he loved making this film. It is, technically speaking, quite the movie. It has an awesome, old fashioned car chase that's one of the best I've seen in a while. It has some very effective and stylish shootouts. It has a few scenes that I think are quite shocking. And so there are all of these well done parts that, for some reason, do not add up to a great film. I'm not completely sure, but I think part of that may have to do with the fact that Affleck is returning to some very familiar themes here. But that really shouldn't be a problem. I am one who doesn't care if I feel like I've been down this road before. It doesn't really matter if the movie had been well made. And in that way, LBN is a somewhat disappointing film...the first for Affleck as director. But like I said. That's o.k. Affleck has the collateral to make such a film. The benefit of the doubt is still very much his. I am still looking forward to whatever film Affleck is going to be directing next. Anticipating a return to greatness after this mere bump in the road. But that's just my opinion.",Live by Night
88,The_moan_of_all_moans,Fugazzi,1,16 January 2017,"There have been a lot of times in my life where, by the end of a film, I have shook my head in dismay, at the thought of wasting my time watching garbage. Yes, this was another one of those occasions. This was one of the worst films I have ever seen; I say that with absolute clarity, without so much of a hint of over-exaggeration. To give you an idea of what the experience of watching this movie is like, I would like you to play out a certain iconic scene in your head. This scene is from the classic ""GoodFellas"" where Joe Pesci's character Tommy has been sent for. To be ""Made"". Imagine Tommy's surprise when that isn't the case and instead he has a grave marking his impending doom awaiting him. That (although slightly more intense..) is the feeling your left with by the time the credits roll. The trailer promises action, and car chases and cool deaths. By the end you feel like Tommy, wondering what would've happened if you hadn't been duped. All i can remember from this film, is Ben Affleck sitting across from someone at a desk or cuddling a female. Action scenes are that of extreme rarity and any ""shocking"" moments are so recklessly placed, that they lose all impact. 45 minutes, boring the viewer to tears, followed by 1 minute of intensity doesn't cut it. It's simply not good enough. The countless trailers leading up to the release, the positive reviews, the cast and this is what we get? Walking out, I felt really bad for anyone who paid around £10 to see it. In a script that includes the Irish and Italian mob and the KKK all intertwined, I find it unacceptable that this is the best they could come up with. At some points I felt this whole film was made, just so Affleck could do his Boston accent again. It is drab, and I can't help but feel extremely disappointed. Everything about the film screams desperation. Each scene, outfit, the dialogue. Trying its very best to convince you that you're watching a genuine gangsters life. And yes that is the whole point of acting and films, but it supposed to flow, to be natural. This is anything but natural. It's...well...Fugazzi. I can only hope that this is a small bump in the road in relation to Affleck and his work as a director, as a mountain of a project awaits him and this is one he cannot afford to mess up.

89,XhcnoirX,Bloody (and) awesome,9,8 February 2017,"Prohibition era Boston. Small-time Irish crook Ben Affleck doesn't want to get caught up in the territorial war between Irish gangster Robert Glenister and Italian gangster Remo Girone. But when he falls for Sienna Miller, an inside woman for one of his jobs, it's too late as she's also Glenister's mistress. When a robbery goes wrong and some cops end up dead, and Glenister gets the word about Miller and Affleck, it's only because of Affleck's dad, a police captain who knows everything about everyone in Boston, that Affleck ends up doing some hard time in prison rather than go to the chair or get killed by Glenister. But Miller's dead and when Affleck gets out again, he wants revenge and turns to Girone. Girone sets Affleck up in Florida where Glenister's been moving in on his liquor business. Affleck does well there and manages to take over most of Glenister's business. But Florida isn't just run by gangsters, it's also run by the KKK... Bloody awesome! If you enjoy the 30s and 40s gangster movies starring James Cagney and Lawrence Tierney (Affleck looks so much like him at times, I am convinced he based his physical demeanor in this movie on him), this movie will bring a smile to your face. While Affleck's character is never quite as ruthless or cold as Cagney's and Tierney's trademark roles, he definitely embodies that same kinda spirit. The movie also touches upon the more political/racial/religious aspects of the era, such as where police captain Chris Cooper tells Affleck he will turn a blind eye as long as he keeps his business to the bad (read: non-white) part of town (and of course there's the KKK as already mentioned above). While Affleck is far from the greatest actor ever, he seems very aware of his limitations and makes them work to his advantage here. It also helps that he's supported by an excellent cast. And the movie looks absolutely stunning with some great sets and set pieces, and tons of beautiful 20s/30s cars (including a great car chase in and around Boston). Affleck, who also directed this movie, and DoP Richard Richardson, as well as the set & art directors, give this movie a great and authentic look, which by itself is worth the price of admission. If there's a negative to this movie, it's that Affleck (also the screenplay writer!) wants to bring too much of Dennis Lehane's source novel to the table. Because of the sheer amount of plot lines some get a bit lost in the shuffle and not given too much attention (I also left out some rather important ones in this review, hah). I assume that similar to his 2010 movie 'The Town' his original cut is way longer than the current 2h9m runtime tho, so hopefully at some point a 'director's cut' of 'Live By Night' sees the light of day. For me however, the 2 hours flew by, and I was on the edge of my seat from the first second to the last. I can't recommend this movie enough, and I am even considering seeing it again in the cinema. Let me say it again: Blood awesome!",Live by Night
90,makleen2,A Lively Gangster Tale,7,25 September 2017,"Strong performances by supporting actors and actresses, wonderful choreography, and exciting action make Live by Night (2016) a thrilling gangster flick despite Ben Affleck's uninspired acting. Affleck adapted the screenplay from a novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane. The film's genuine look and feel is no doubt attributable to the source material. Although the characters are not based on real people, they might as well have been. For his part, Lehane wrote the novel about rum running to show the ""sexy side of Prohibition."" Exotic, tropical locales, flashy clothes, fast cars, and excessive violence characterize both the novel and the film.This sprawling movie spans several decades and locations, from Boston to south Florida. As the film opens, Joe Coughlin (Ben Affleck) is a WW1 veteran and bank robber in Boston. He falls in love with Emma Gould (Sienna Miller), mistress of Irish mob boss Albert White (Robert Glenister). Italian mob boss Maso Pescatore (Remo Girone) tries to blackmail Coughlin into killing Albert White. Unfortunately, Emma betrays him and White tries to have both her and Coughlin killed.After spending several years in prison for a bank robbery gone wrong, Coughlin approaches Pescatore and asks him to help get revenge on Albert White. Pescatore sends him to Ybor City, Tampa, Florida, where White had set up his own operation, to run his speakeasies and muscle out White.While there, Coughlin meets and marries a Cuban woman named Graciela Corrales (Zoe Saldana). He battles the KKK, other gangsters, hostile businessmen, and Evangelical Christians in his pursuit to corner the rum market and ultimately get Florida to legalize gambling so the mob can run its casinos. Coughlin and Pescatore come to blows in a bloody climax and Coughlin retires from his life of crime.Live by Night is ultimately about ""what goes around, comes around."" In several instances, characters' past decisions come back to haunt them, and their bad behavior is repaid with pain, suffering, and loss. No one escapes this movie unscathed, except perhaps for Coughlin's son, who I assume goes on to lead a normal life.The film's realism is refreshing, as is its style and attention to detail. Its chase scenes are fast and exciting, and even the report of Tommy guns is genuinely loud and intimidating. To be sure, there are a lot of clichés in this movie, but the clichés work—most of the time.In Live by Night, a conflict erupts between the mafia and the Ku Klux Klan in Florida. The 1920s Klan was predominantly located in the Midwest, not the South, but they did vehemently uphold Prohibition. A war between bootleggers and the Klan in Southern Illinois lends historical precedent to such a subplot. Unfortunately, Live by Night fell back on well-worn clichés about dumb, inbred hicks and missed an opportunity to add historical depth and nuance.I also found the love triangle subplot unconvincing. Infatuation with Emma Gould, a free-spirited Irish flapper, supposedly ties together Joe Coughlin and Albert White in Boston. After Coughlin and Emma's affair is revealed, White intends to kill both of them. Coughlin and White believe Emma drowns when the car she was in plunged into the river. Later, in Florida, Coughlin discovers Emma is alive and living in Miami when he sees her in the background of a photograph.Albert White also lives in Miami. Naturally, I assumed Emma followed him there or they reconnected somehow—because otherwise, why would she move to a city where her former lover was running a powerful criminal organization? When Coughlin confronts White with evidence of her apparent survival, however, the revelation completely shocks him. It's made clear earlier in the film that White considers Emma to be a disposable possession. Even if he believed her dead, why would he care if she was alive? Nothing we've seen indicates he was in love with her.Despite these flaws, Live by Night is a thoroughly entertaining gangster film populated by an interesting cast of characters. Whereas, in Public Enemies (2009), Johnny Depp's personality overshadowed that of his costars, Ben Affleck has no such effect. His costars are left to shine as he often fades into the background. Elle Fanning receives an honorable mention for her portrayal of fallen angel-turned prophet Loretta Figgis. Brendan Gleeson also gave a strong performance as Joe Coughlin's police captain father, Thomas Coughlin.",Live by Night

92,parleon-thedon,Live By Night - Review: Obscure Pretension,7,15 January 2017,"Directing a movie is not an easy task. I can only imagine the suffering a director goes through each time they approach a project.Ben Affleck is no stranger to directing stupendous projects. Each movie that I've watched from director Affleck's filmography showcases his eminent talent on film. People can say what they want about Affleck as an actor, but they can't deny the man's technique as a director. I believe that director Affleck's movies will stand the test of time. Affleck as a director has a tendency to provide his audience with an unflinching visualization of neorealism that is Americanized. When Affleck crafts a movie, he usually doesn't compromise the integrity of it with unnecessary violence. Affleck's director showcase movies tend to get down to the nitty-gritty with social commentary and discussion on urban politics.In case you haven't realized by now, I'm a huge fan of Ben Affleck as a director. When I first heard about Live By Night directed by Ben Affleck, I became very excited. In my eyes, Affleck is a director of the highest caliber who deserves respect such as a Christopher Nolan.Unfortunately, Live By Night doesn't live up to Ben Affleck's potential. Now don't get me wrong, the directing in this movie was top-notch, but it takes more than that to capture my attention.The story presented here was a bit of a mess. One minute we're focusing on storyline A, then storyline B comes in, and then storyline A is discarded briefly. Do you get what I'm saying? I have a good enough attention span when it comes to watching movies, but this pretentious movie couldn't hold my attention. I knew what was happening as the story progressed, but the story didn't seize my interest. However, one plot point present in the movie firmly held my interest. Nonsensical gratuitous violence overshadows something that could've been fantasy-love-vengeance-warfare. I understand that warfare is never pretty, but is it possible to show the casualties of war? If I don't care about who lives or who dies in your movie, then you've got a serious problem on your hands.Ben Affleck is a great director, but is he a good actor? Affleck seems very stiff in this movie. His body language and facial expression are all through out of whack here. Sienna Miller's character screen time was minimal, but the actor was effective in the role. Zoe Saldana, she did nothing in this movie, and so I didn't care about her. Elle Fanning's performance was good. Fanning has one scene of dialog that stands out. Chris Cooper had some good moments. His performance outshined actors who attempted to perform with him. Brendan Gleeson stands out the most to me. Gleeson's performance was captivating without trying too hard. However, a shout-out to Anthony Michael Hall, his performance was the most memorable because I had no idea that was him on screen.The music presented in the movie was good. Scenes flowed fluently with the music in place. I have no gripes with the music aspect of this movie.Overall, I liked the directing, the music, and one scene of dialog with Elle Fanning. Gratuitous violence annihilated my sense of sensation. Maybe there was a message within the violence. Like I said, ""Fanning has one scene of dialog that stands out."" What Fanning said was very profound. Fanning's scene of dialog wrapped the movie in a nutshell, and it made sense within the context of the narrative. But still, I felt like the violence overstayed its welcome. The movie felt to showy to me, flashes, and bangs were the focal point here. I felt like I was watching a movie as I was watching the movie. I felt numb watching this thing. Movies are supposed to immerse the audience in their world, but that's not the case with this. Pretentious, repetitive, and dull is how I would describe this movie.Final Grade: B-",Live by Night

In a nutshell, this movie sucked!!!Ben Affleck is an assured director with a some good films under his belt such as ""Gone Baby Gone,"" ""The Town,"" and the academy award winner ""Argo."" ""Live By Night"" had great potential but squandered it with an uninvolved, overstuffed, boring, rushed, lackluster and turd-infested flop. Ben Affleck's character had the same monotonous inflection and static demeanor as his character in ""The Accountant."" But at least in ""The Accountant"" he was autistic. In this film he played some guy named Joe. And that's really all you can say about his character. The story was so unoriginal and boring you could take a nap for half the movie and not miss anything important. Everything was told to us through narration which felt like it was cramming in as much crap as possible from Dennis Lehane's book. This would of worked better as a TV show with all the stuff they threw in this movie, AND if they had followed through with their original plans of casting Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role. Let's be real, add Leo to anything and it will be much better.""Live By Night"" might be one of the most disappointing movies of the year as well as the biggest waste of talent. The potential was there with this cast, source material of Dennis Lehane's book, and the thrills of Prohibition mob violence, yet still somehow failed in delivering characters worth caring about, a story worth being engaged in, and anything worth remembering. Ben, please learn from your mistakes and make a better picture next time. There's only so much disappointment we can take in a year.",Live by Night

Any ""allusions"" to morality it really doesnt work at all.I dont know if Affleck is Catholic but trying to cloak this effort as a morality play is a bit pointless.OKAY we get it ""you reap what you sow""Elle Fanning is fantastic in this, she stole the movie, as did Chris Cooper.

101,BestBenedikt,Unfortunately Affleck's worst film so far,5,20 January 2019,"Ben Affleck has already proven being capable of directing good films in the past. But even though his talent in this regard occasionally shines through in LIVE BY NIGHT, his latest directorial effort is ultimately superficial and blank.While the film offers some nice scenes including a well crafted final shootout, the main problem lies in the weak script. The jumbled plot doesn't allow for any character development and instead chooses to cobble together a bunch of gangster film clichés that we've all seen before in better films.Speaking of character development, the tagline to the film ""Joe was once a good man"" doesn't make any sense, since Joe is portrayed as a criminal from the get-go. But although his actions during the two hour runtime certainly make him seem like an asshole, the film constantly tries to market him as the good guy and desperately tries to give him a moral profile.Aside from that, Ben Affleck generally felt miscast and at times even completely out of place. Him being in his forties and performing the role of a young man rising up to power was just unsuitable for the film. It reminded me of Tom Cruise playing that young soldier in THE MUMMY - and we all know how that worked out.Unfortunately, LIVE BY NIGHT is a weak and forgettable film. Affleck probably knew that, as suggested by his uninspired and sleepwalking performance. Let's hope his next film will turn the tide for the better.",Live by Night

103,TheJediWay9,"""Live By Night"" Is Very Underrated But By Far Affleck's Weakest",8,31 May 2017,"""Live By Night"" is written, produced, and directed by Ben Affleck and also stars Ben Affleck and is about a group of gangsters from Boston who face competition in Tampa Bay from outside foes. Ben Affleck is a master class, having done a great job with Gone Baby Gone, The Town (my personal favorite of his), and Argo, and so I was looking forward to seeing what he did with ""Live By Night."" Having missed out on it in theaters, I picked up the blu-ray and I have to say that though I do think that out of this group of films listed above this is his weakest effort, this is a very underrated film. I found this film to be extremely riveting, well acted, and well directed with a vast variety of action set pieces. This film has its flaws, no doubt, but the positives outweighs the negatives for me.Ben Affleck should already have an Oscar for Best Director. The way he directs his actors and his cameraman is perfection. There are a lot of shots were the camera pans slightly and it works in this film. He knows how to craft a brilliant shot, how to properly frame a shot, how to film action sequences in ways the viewers can follow it. He does all of that to perfection in this film, and the acting is top notch. Everyone in this film gives a really good performance and really showcase their acting abilities. The set design is superb. It reminded me of films like ""Lawless,"" ""The Untouchables,"" and ""Public Enemies"" in the way it re-created the Prohibition era in the United States. Everything within these set pieces felt top notch. They did their homework to really make this feel like an old school gangster film, and it really worked. The costume design is also excellent. All technical aspects aside, this film's faults lie within its writing. Affleck is doing four things with this movie, and at times it shows. There are times where the plot becomes heard to follow. It relies on you to recall certain characters you haven't seen for quite some time, and that's irritating. These characters were mostly the ones that were underdeveloped. And that was a problem for me was the character development. No one was all that fleshed out. None of these characters really gave me a reason to care or to root for them other than the main character Joe Coughlin, played brilliantly by Affleck himself. Elle Fanning's character, I dunno what the hell she was, but her performance and her character were both quite bad. Characters pop in and out like it's nothing, and the movie expects you to remember who these characters are for the entire runtime, and that becomes frustrating after awhile, especially when the story gets a little hard to follow at certain points. My other complaint is that there is a chunk of this movie towards the end where not a lot happens. This half hour is really uneventful. The movie was going along at a great pace and then about an hour and twenty minutes into the movie it slows down a lot. Definitely Ben Affleck's weakest effort, but I really did end up liking ""Live By Night"" more than I thought. Very underrated in my book.I am going to give ""Live By Night"" a 7.7/10",Live by Night
104,gemandeye1,Good movie that could have been a Great Movie,6,3 March 2017,This movie just lacked something. Chemistry. Flow of scenes. Feeling of realism. Actors not seeming to care about their roles. The premise was good. Some of the shoot outs ad action was quite enjoyable. It just didn't mesh. Affleck has directed ad acted in so much better. The Town especially tops his list. This is far from being a prohibition era version of the town even though people said that was the attempt. It's a watch only once movie. Unlike the Town which I have watched countless times. I'm sure by the way this movie flopped at the Box Office and with fans knowing Affleck he will step up his game on his next venture.

106,mike3386,Gangster Eye Candy,6,15 January 2017,"Despite a number of ""professional"" critics being very unkind to this movie (they've always loved to pound on Ben Affleck), we found some things to enjoy, e.g., crystal clear and interesting photography (without the obligatory stumbling and fumbling in the dark), terrific costumes and wardrobes, great looking – and sounding – guns, especially the Thompson submachine gun and the ""chunk-chunk-chunk"" of the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), interesting and beautiful sets/locations, and handsome guys and gorgeous gals.The movie is true to its ""R"" rating with some steamy sex without being overly graphic, certainly not pornographic. The story is especially intriguing although some critics are determined to pan it for being predictable . . . hey! it's a gangster movie, it is what it is, with very little pretense at trying to be more or something that it isn't. At times the plot was more implied than explained, e.g., are the gangsters running rum, making cigars, robbing banks, building casinos, or just killing people? Speaking of preposterous, some of the shootouts – even for a gangster movie – border on video game impossible, for example, car chase scenes at close range with cops bristling with submachine guns unable to hit the driver despite hundreds of bullet holes all over the fleeing vehicle.Some of the characters are interesting, some not so much so. Ben's sidekick, Chris Messina is humorous, the bad guys are bad guys, and Zoe Zaldana grabs our hearts and minds, the viewer just knows she is something special. Forever a Chris Cooper fan, I found his role a bit far fetched, and his very young daughter (Elle Fanning) was actually a distraction, impossible to believe. Brendan Gleeson as Ben's cop father is almost a cameo, but Matthew Maher puts a defining stamp on ""Southern redneck"". Ben's own character is stoic, showing almost no emotion despite dominating the movie minutes; maybe it really is time for Ben to decide, actor or director, but not both at the same time.In our particular theater, which usually blasts the sound, we struggled to actually HEAR much of the (interesting) dialogue, but no points have been deducted from the rating because this certainly SEEMED a theater problem and not the fault of the movie; however, Affleck's character resorts to mumbling many of his lines. This movie should transfer well to DVD and home flat panel TVs; at 128 minutes, settle in, there is a lot to absorb.Ben Affleck acting, directing and writing.",Live by Night

It's not boring, it's not slow, it's perhaps slightly longer than usual but it's easy to understand why: there's a lot to show and a lot to say.For me it was thought provoking, gripping, mesmerizing without too much sentimentality even though love is the most important ingredient of its story. Through love the main character discovers his true self and we all become better off.There's a lot of betrayal, cruelty, deaths and filth in this film, yet it turned to be very kind and caring - and I want to thank its creators for turning an otherwise grim and sad story into something you immensely enjoy.I loved pretty much everything about the film, and perhaps the most powerful is the wonderful music score which lightly underscored the main events, yet was mostly invisible.There's just one scene in the film which made me remove a single point: the scene where the protagonist in his car is being chased by two police cars.

The over two hours fly by and it probably could have been over three hours and we still would have been glued to the screen. The sex scenes, we believe, could have been eliminated from the movie and that time used to express the emotional love the characters had developed instead of just the animal act (but that is just our view that we have for most movies that seem to have to show sex scenes) The narration volume seemed too high compared to the regular dialog but: That is just another plus. The screenplay being read while the movie is running is just another added bonus that was new and captivating.

119,davidarcher,GREAT movie - except for casting Ben Affleck,7,14 May 2017,"Live by Night comes THAT close to being a great movie and perhaps even a classic. It a great story with an amazing cast that turns in excellent performances, and the production design and cinematography beautifully recreates Prohibition-era Boston and Tampa. And, it gets extra points for having a classic car chase / shoot out – using an entire fleet of 1920 autos. Ben Affleck, the director, has done a very impressive job.There's just one problem: Ben Affleck, the actor. Top to bottom, the movie pays homage to the Godfather, and Ben Affleck clearly attempts to pay homage to Al Pacino's character. Unfortunately, and to paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen, ""I watched Al Pacino in the Godfather. I loved Al Pacino in the Godfather. Al Pacino in the Godfather was a like a friend to me. Ben, you're no Al Pacino."" And that's the problem. Every character in the movie is perfectly cast and turns in pitch perfect-performances. Except for Affleck, who just doesn't come off as a ruthless gangster. Every of his appearances was a bit jarring, kind of like ordering a Pastrami sandwich at the Carnegie Deli and have it served on Wonder Bread. Ben Affleck, the director, did the movie an almost fatal disservice by miscasting Ben Affleck, the actor.Elle Fanning is luminous as an evangelist with a damaged soul, while Chris Messina, Brendan Gleeson, Chris Cooper, Matthew Maher and Maso Pescatore each shine in their roles.

124,showmethemoviescontact,Live by Night ShowMeTheMovies Review,3,10 February 2017,"Written, directed and produced by the lead himself, a run-of-the-mill, roaring '20's gangster flick lacking in imagination; a quickly-forgotten, unremarkable tale.Our story begins in a glamorized 1920's Boston; Joe Coughlin (Affleck) is a WWI-veteran and small-time hoodlum with a nepotistic bail-out and a forbidden love-affair. After being recruited by Mafia boss Maso Pescatore, Joe heads down a road of money and privilege from his new-found criminal activities in Tampa. The film leads on to the atypical gangster gun fights, dodgy deals and 'business meetings' fueled by whiskey and cigars. Amidst this, somehow (and unsubtly) thrown in are story lines of Klansmen, heroin addiction and Christianity.In all honesty, I don't really know what this film was attempting to achieve - a little bit of everything and a whole lot of nothing encased the 130 minute viewing, leaving me unsure to an extent what even happened. The (overly-) quick pacing in certain parts were unbalanced alongside the dull, awkward rest of the movie. I found myself almost wanting to take a well-deserved nap during the screening, for I felt that I wouldn't miss much and if I had would have woken up more than capable of still keeping up with the films' 'plot'.Ben Affleck seemed a weak link in an already weak chain - his dry performance only made worse by his failure to direct the rest of the notably irritating cast (namely, Elle Fanning and Sienna Miller, although Zoe Saldana was disappointingly bland). Robert Glenister and Chris Cooper the only saviours among the acting standards here.The costume was superbly cliché 1920's get-up, which whilst suited the tone of the film, made Affleck appear to be wearing his dads' suit and every female seemingly permanently overdressed for the occasion. The cinematography was not diabolical, however action shots alone allowed it to shine through. Notably, the action (when it happened) was pulled off fairly well, but for a gangster movie you would think there would be a lot more - particularly boring for a 'fast-paced action flick'.I wasn't expecting a cinematic masterpiece from Live by Night, but I did expect a hell of a lot more from a man who has over two decades of industry experience. My advice to anyone looking for an action-packed badass gangster film is to check out The Godfather or Pulp Fiction and leave this be. A shoddy performance all-round.",Live by Night

It did look beautiful though but really meandered badly...",Live by Night
126,rajveerdhanak,Sadly Underwhelming and Forgettable.,4,1 June 2019,"Starting with the pros of this film:The best (and most visually pleasant) aspect of this film is its cinematography, which is done by the same DP of The Hateful Eight, another recent period-piece. The exterior shots are absolutely stunning, and other shots are very creatively choreographed and filmed. My only gripe is that since the film is set in the 1920s-40s, the visual tangibility would be much more accentuated if the movie was shot on film instead of digital.This may not be an issue at all for layman movie-goers, but being a filmmaker and movie-buff, the effect of photo-chemical film would've been totally worth it.Watching this film with a bass-heavy headphone simply adds to the intensity of the gun shots, along with other incidental sounds and foley such as the ambience of the time-period. Even the sometimes-unnecessary narration of Ben Affleck is pleasant to hear due to his satisfyingly crisp voice quality.Speaking of gun-shot intensity, the action sequences (particularly the car chase scene and the climax shootout) are very well directed and edited, making them another highlight of this film. It's apparent that Affleck's direction interest lies more with the intense moments of the film than the dialogue-driven scenes.One of the most important elements of a period-piece is its set and costume design, and fortunately the production design department of this film recognises this importance. Everything in the frame (a.k.a. the mise-en-scene) that is the sets, costumes, vehicles, buildings, props, etc. enhances the feel of the period piece and sells the time-period very well.Elle Fanning's appearance is short but most noteworthy among the other cast, which is not only benefited by her gifted talent in acting, but also in the casting. Her character was the most believable among the others, possibly from the lack of any caricature/exaggerated accents. She shines in a scene where her character (a preacher of Christianity) expresses depressing doubts about the existence of God and the criteria for Heaven and Hell after death, which itself was a well-written and noteworthy scene.
But unfortunately, the film ends up becoming underwhelming due to the incredibly weak screenplay and unfocused direction.The screenplay poses several problems, ranging from pacing, intent, focus, dialogues, and characters. The dialogue scenes are very uninteresting due to most of the dialogues being mere info-dumps, especially in the first act. The characters too are very dull, being written simply to serve a particular purpose to the main character without any sense of relationship dynamics.I honestly couldn't care much for Affleck's character, which primarily stems from being badly written, but also a seemingly uninterested and bored performance from Affleck himself. Like the other actors, his accent too becomes exaggerated and inconsistent.Coming to the focus and intent, I couldn't help but notice Affleck taking advantage of being the auteur of the film in attempting to display himself (as Ben, not the character) in a certain light of artificial charm and charisma. He's written his own character as a ladies' man though he is clearly not convincing as such, and a disturbing thought stems in mind about the incorporation of the sex scenes - considering him being the sole writer, director and actor.Speaking of the relationship aspect, the chemistry between his character and Saldana's is almost non-existent. Saldana's character is written to be a 'perfect' woman, instead ending up becoming very shallow due to the lack of any flaws in her and their relationship.Though the film is intended to be character driven, it has resulted in a failure due to the characters (including Affleck's) not really having any weight (in writing and in performances), excruciatingly lacking in any adequate characterization - including relationships of other characters with the protagonists, the protagonists' flaws that would ideally increase the drama, and the scrubbing-though nature of the film.Seeing the vastness of the character's story in the novel, the film ends up becoming another tragic example of adaptational trimming - hence unable to deliver justice to the character and the source material. This may have been solved by adapting an episodic format of storytelling as a TV show instead of a film, but it still remains that Affleck and many of the cast members have been clearly miscast.At the end, even the gorgeous technical aspects couldn't save the film from becoming shallow, depthless and unengaging. Despite speculations that Affleck's personal problems of divorce and alcoholism may have affected this film, the truth is that the film is simply a product of a weak directorial intent and unrefined skill stemming from an unpracticed craft.",Live by Night

He dreamed about it, spend time for script, directing, producing, for casting, negotiations with studio etc. The whole story, as it is, may have potential, it is interesting, dynamic, sometimes dramatic....But i believe the main reason of such low rating level is scenario. Especially dialogs - they sound like 8 years schoolboy write some essay about how he spend summer, siting in home and gaming in 'Mafia'. Dialogs and 'author parts' are sound so simple and so primitively, you can spot such in B class movies in late 30th. Some of movie parts look like incomplete. We have not met widely with main 'colleague' of Joe Coughlin - Dion Bartolo. The personage played by Elle Faning should have more time and her relationships with father and his suffering requires more time. 'Thomas Coughlin' personage played by Brendan Gleeson, should have more then 4-5 scenes in movie, giving such little time to this actor - shame for director!From technical point of view, thing like cinematography, music&sound, visuals, costumes an etc. looks very nice and creates picture of really big and serious project.Other words, Ben Affleck as Director have success and i am sure he will have more progress in this role, but as a Script writer he needs help.

131,marcar912,Quadruple Threat Fails Again,1,9 August 2017,"Ben Affleck proves once again that he cannot write, direct, produce and star in a movie. He has failed to create an interesting picture despite the fascinating material he has at hand. First, the novel by Dennis Lehane; second, the territory of gangland Boston and Florida during Prohibition; third and finally, a cast of great actors in the supporting roles from Brendan Gleeson to Elle Fanning, Chris Messina and Chris Cooper. Why isn't this a good movie? It should be, but Affleck once again does not seem to be able to take the helm wearing all those hats and produce a great movie. The stereotypes abound, the women are cardboard cutouts and the Godfather it ain't. I read this movie was originally going to run to three hours, before Warner Bros forced Affleck to cut it. As it is, at a few minutes over 2 hours, I can't imagine sitting through more of this boring, snail-paced and dull gangster film. Don't waste your time on Live By Night: watch the Untouchables, rent the Godfather trilogy or, better yet, go outside and take a long walk instead.",Live by Night
132,Whingewood,"Good gangster film, follows a lot of the traditional story lines, but enjoyable nonetheless",8,17 January 2017,"After seeing a few trailers for this, I was quite look forward to watching it. I like old-school gangster films, and Ben Affleck is on something of a roll at the moment, so I was optimistic.The story follows the fortunes of Joe Coughlin (played by Ben Affleck) who becomes embroiled in the criminal underworld. It goes through the typical rise to power and betrayal themes of these kinds of films, which while it has been done before, was still entertaining to watch.Ben Affleck does a good job, as do Sienna Miller, Robert Glenister, Remo Girone, and Zoe Saldana. Mention should also go to Chris Cooper who played Chief Figgis. His character's interactions with Joe Coughlin and the way their relationship changed as the film progressed were a highlight (can't go into details for spoiler reasons).The action scenes were fantastic. I really like the old style cars and guns (who doesn't like Tommy Guns?), and these scenes really delivered.

133,williamzoran,I didn't mind it but...,10,31 January 2017,... Elle Fanning was magnificent. The movie was OK. Style was spot on and there was a lot of action but all of that paled once Elle Fanning hit the screen and for the first time you became interested in a character. The difference between her first appearance on screen compared to her later appearance after experiencing some life lessons to her last moment when her character lets down a facade and reveals her soul is masterful acting. The film goes back to just being OK once she is off screen. I always think of Di Caprio being almost to young looking to have the gravitas for some of the roles he plays but his skill as an actor he always pulls it off. Similarly Elle seems almost too young and too pretty yet she brings substance and nuance to her performances and this is no exception. Only a small role for her yet almost worth seeing the film for.,Live by Night

Several times I felt like walking out and getting popcorn or checking the news blogs. Perhaps they tried to cram too many plot lines into one movie.

135,mydistracteduniverse,"A bit long winded at times, but otherwise not bad",9,21 January 2017,"Live by Night is a old style gangster movie, that plays out in the height of the prohibition era on the east coast and the south of the Untied States. It features Ben Affleck, Sienna Miller and Zoe Saldana amongst a whole host of other stars.When Joe Coughlin comes back from serving in the First World War he is done taking orders. He's seen too many good people die senseless deaths following other people's directions.After he returns to Boston he decides to become an outlaw. For the next ten years he sleeps by day and lives by night, robbing anyone worth stealing from. But, robbing banks and gaming parlours had to bring him to the attention of the wrong people at some stage.His life style eventually catches up with him when he finds himself caught between the Italian mob, lead by Maso Pescatore, and the Irish mob, lead by Albert White. Joe's lover is the girlfriend of Albert White, a fact that hasn't gone unnoticed by the Italians. Maso Pescatore tries to blackmail him with that fact into killing White.Coughlin refuses as he still resents taking orders from anyone and also does not want to be associated with the mob. Pescatore rats him out to White, landing Joe first in hospital and then in prison. His lover is killed in the mayhem following the events that lead up to Joes incarceration.A new StartWhen he gets out he decides to join the Italian mob after all, hoping to be able to avenge Emma's death. Maso sends him down to Tampa, Florida to wrestle the city from Albert's hands, who has taken over the rum distribution in Florida.

Being in a relationship with a black woman however, brings a whole new set of trouble in form of the Klu Klux Klan to his doorstep. After some initial set backs, Joe disposes of local splinter group the Italian way.In the end there is a big show down between Joe, Albert White and Maso Pescatore.I really like Live At Night. It is an good old fashioned gangster movie, something you don't see often anymore. The script is great, although it did feel a little long winded at times. At some points I could not believe that there was yet another twist in the story. But in the end it all made sense.Ben Affleck was a busy man with Live By Night.

136,stephen-humphries,Ben Affleck is a Depressing Bore.,1,27 January 2017,"This is a boring pile of horse manure. It starts off as a poorly made gangster film, then side steps into a shoddy tale about racism and eventually becomes a mawkish love story. It finally sticks it hard in your ass with a depressing, wretched and tragic ending. Ben Affleck is a tiresome misery - he makes a good movie or a high profile movie like Good Will Hunting, or Batman vs Superman:- then he says to himself:- ""Awesome I have got every-bodies attention I must now make a series of tedious, annoying, self-indulgent films to teach everyone a lesson!"" 'Gigli', 'Man About Town', 'Runner Runner', 'Pearl Harbor', 'Phantoms' etc , etc, etc.If I see one more film where he tries to play the strong silent type but comes off as a sullen faced sanctimonious bore I think I will vomit my damn guts out of my ears.

137,JMCReelReviews,It looks fantastic but as a drama it is severely lacking in impact and finesse.,6,16 January 2017,"Ben Affleck returns to Dennis Lehane's work with this adaptation of Live By Night, the second novel in a trilogy (starting with The Given Day and finishing with World Gone By). Live By Night is a gangster epic which follows the rise to power of Joe Coughlin, a young Boston criminal who ends up running an empire in Florida for the Italian mob. As with The Town and Argo, Affleck casts himself in the leading role and is joined by an impressive supporting cast including Sienna Miller, Zoe Saldana, Elle Fanning, Robert Glenister, Chris Cooper and Brendan Gleeson.The film begins with Coughlin, as the narrator, introducing himself as a veteran who has returned disillusioned from WW1 to the extent that he refuses to follow rules or take orders from anybody. As such, he now considers himself an outlaw. We see him and his crew embark on daring robberies, including a poker game ran by one of Boston's major gangsters, Albert White (played with menacing vigour by Glenister) whose moll is having an affair with Coughlin. As repercussions ensue, Coughlin reluctantly takes on a job for White's mob rivals who send him to Ybor City, Florida, in order to take over their rum import enterprise during the prohibition era. Despite initial protestations that he is not a gangster, does not want to be wedded to the mob or have to take orders from anyone, he eventually concedes to his circumstances and his need for revenge against White, and so quickly sets about establishing his presence, authority and power across Southern Florida. In doing so, he finds love, friendship and enemies as he encounters the wrath of various strands of the Florida populous, ranging from the devoutly religious to the KKK, who take umbrage with his diverse business and personal relations. Naturally, events head toward a bloody and violent showdown.As an addition to the gangster genre, Live By Night certainly has a uniqueness to it. Thanks to the Florida setting, there is a notable feel and style to the film. Whereas the typical gangster movie might be set in dark and claustrophobic city locations such as Chicago, New York, Detroit or Boston, the story here is told against sun-soaked, colourful and expansive scenery which provides a sense of heat so stifling that it can almost be felt coming through the screen. The film also boasts some sumptuous scenery, particularly of the Florida glades, whilst the early 20th Century town-life of Ybor City really comes to life thanks to excellent design, costumes and vibrant music. It was interesting, too, to see a gangster film based during the prohibition era which told its story from the perspective of the suppliers of the alcohol, rather than the city-based recipients. Additionally, the ethnic diversity of the characters form a foundation for the depiction of the racism that was so prevalent in the southern United States during this period, and this gives Live By Night a distinctiveness within the genre.Unfortunately, whilst Affleck has proved himself to be a superb director, this is by far his weakest effort. Hastily cut and edited, the first act in particular chops and changes scenes with such frenetic pace and frequency one could be forgiven for feeling queasy with motion sickness. This may very well be a conscious decision by Affleck, as Coughlin's voice-over thankfully helps provide some degree of constructive narrative, but as a result any provision of context, plot or character development feels completely overlooked; an issue that lingers throughout the film. Too much feels glossed over and rushed, with relationships suddenly formed and underdeveloped, whilst character motivations and intentions are under-explored and largely ignored.Lehane's novel does not suffer from the same issues and therefore the source material cannot be blamed here. Indeed, we are introduced to Coughlin in the first novel, The Given Day, and his character, relationships, background, grievances and drive are detailed thoroughly. With Affleck's film, he introduces us to Coughlin midway through the character's reality and doesn't bother to lay a foundation for him. As a result, Coughlin's relationship with his high-ranking police officer father is barely covered, whereas Lehane uses this as one of the core influences behind his intention to live a life of crime. In the film, Coughlin says how he mourns for a lost love, but this is not something we actually get to see. Again, Lehane uses this as a key impetus for his character. Affleck's Coughlin, a petty criminal, insists on not becoming a gangster, yet hits the ground running the second he arrives in Florida setting up the empire. There are various other examples which all highlight how the events within Affleck's film are mostly conceived out of pure convenience.Compounding this sense of underdevelopment and hastiness is an infuriating lack of any indication of how much time is passing throughout the story. At one point towards the end of the film, Coughlin refers to a girl who died in 1927, and this just highlighted the fact that, aside from references to US Presidents and the end of prohibition, there is nothing to suggest when these events are taking place or indeed how long they are taking.It's frustratingly poor storytelling, especially when considering the strength and quality of the source material. Combined with Affleck being so prominent in his leading role, his decision as the director to use so many facial close-ups and lingering shots of Coughlin means that Live By Night essentially feels like a self indulgence piece. Ironically, his brother Casey would arguably have made a better Coughlin and perhaps Affleck would benefit from staying behind the camera next time.Ultimately, Live By Night is a missed opportunity. It looks fantastic, and there are some excellent action sequences including car chases and shoot-outs, but as a drama it is severely lacking in impact and finesse.",Live by Night

139,IanFRobinson,Early 20th century gangster movie with all the tropes and a few twists,8,15 January 2017,"Spoilers aplenty below.Live By Night is a gangster film set in early 20th century Boston and Florida. Ben Affleck, who also directs and wrote the screenplay by adapting a Dennis Lehane novel, stars as Joe Coughlin, the son of a Boston-based Police Chief of Irish descent.Coughlin returns from the Great War in Europe in 1918 disillusioned by the killing of so many of his compatriots, while the people higher up in society remained largely unscathed or even profited from the war. He vows never to let anyone tell him what to do again and becomes a small-time 'outlaw' in Boston. He and two accomplices commit bank robberies and other crimes. They do this outside of the major Irish and Italian crime organisations operating in Boston who are fighting each other for control. Inevitably he gets caught up in the Boston gangster scene. In no small part due to the fact he is having a relationship with Emma Gould, the Moll of the head of the Irish faction Albert White. After a bank raid goes wrong, Coughlin and Gould plan to go to California, but White and his accomplices capture him with the help of Emma who betrays him to save herself. Coughlin seems doomed, but the police arrive to arrest him for the bank job, and therefore stop his murder. He only gets three years in prison largely due to the influence of his father who has damaging information about the prosecutor of the case.Coughlin's father tells him that Emma was killed by White, and when he gets out of prison he goes to the head of the Italian faction, Maso Pescatore, so he can get a chance to kill Albert White for killing Emma. Pescatore tells him that in the three years he's been in prison White and his gang have been driven out of Boston. He gives Coughlin the job of running the Italian prohibition busting rum smuggling operation from Florida to Boston.Coughlin takes over and runs the rum smuggling operation very successfully for years in combination with the Cuban's and other immigrants. He falls for and marries Graciela, the sister of the head of the Cuban smuggling business. Everything is operating fine until prohibition repeal starts to be discussed. Coughlin attempts to build a large casino to switch the business from smuggling to gambling, but his plans are derailed by a young girl preacher who turns the town against the idea. At the same time, the local KKK faction is trying to muscle in on the speakeasy and future casino businesses. They also don't like the fact that Coughlin and others are living with Cuban's and other non-white people. Coughlin sorts out the KKK, but he later gets double-crossed by Pescatore. Fortunately, he see's this coming and has a plan in placeThe acting in Live By Night is great. Sienna Miller as fantastic as the Moll Emma Gould. Her Cork accent is fantastic. Elle Fanning isn't in the film much, but her portrayal of the young preacher Loretta Figgis is fantastic. Fanning was in my favourite film from 2016 (The Neon Demon). She is turning into an excellent actor. The rest of the cast are good, but Miller and Fanning stand out. The script is good, and the cinematography is first class, and the film looks gorgeous. The sets and costumes all fit into the 1920's to 1940's vibe. Perhaps a bit to clean and sharp for depression period America, but I wasn't there so can't say. It didn't detract from the feel.I liked Live By Night. It had all the tropes you would expect in a north-east American based gangster film. And you need those tropes in a film of this type or you might feel short-changed. It is done well and has a few twists you might not expect. I rated it 8/10. Close to a 9, but not quite.

Some elements of the production, i.e., the cinematography and casting are ok, except that the actor selected to play the lead role of character Joe Coughlin (actor Ben Affleck, who also wrote and directed the screen play), wasn't a good choice. Affleck doesn't look the part of this ""would-be"" gangster nor does he do a good job of being convincing. To me he presented on-screen as a silly man and out of place. I've never been one of Affleck's fans, though I know many people are, at best I consider him a ""B-grade"" actor, one generally incapable of delivering convincing performances anytime in any role he plays. So, I am acknowledging my bias toward him to the point that it will affect my rating of this film. Unfortunately, I also feel Affleck's abilities as a writer and director are limited, a matter clearly evident here.

Seems like the movie has stripped away all the deep tissue from the book and over emphasize a lot of the less important body parts. Like the focus on JD Pruitt, a minor and rather uninteresting character in the book blown up to over inflated proportions in this movie. Huge swaths of narrative has been chopped off completely. For instance Coughlins time in prison which really is fundamental for how he ended up as a rum smuggler in Florida. Emma Gould has none of the darkness and void the book so well portray, leaving Coughlins doomed love for her rather incomprehensible. The two crime kingpins, White and Pescatore are way too mainstream for a movie with ambition. Only Chief Figgis conjured by Chris Cooper leave a lasting impression.The best thing this movie got going is the light nuances in the night time scenes, spot on to the light or lack of light the book is so thick of.

If the above said were not enough, the crap lasts 130 minutes of unbearable boredom. By the way, I loved the Cuban music played in that Florida party; the movie makers imply this is about 1930 but the orchestra sounds like Gloria Stefan's songs, those guys were 70 years ahead of their time! *Wonderful*! And this gross inaccuracy is a strong characteristic of the film, as every possible approach to all possible events of the late twenties/early thirties (they only forgot to cleverly link the plot to Lindbergh's kidnapping) is seen through the lens of the nice opinions of today. This is therefore probably the fakest thirties you can see on a screen. I also want to underline the utterly stupid and worthless ""morals"" of the story, as it is plain from start that the badass played by Affleck is not better than the guys he fights & kills, and some of his actions are particularly disgusting and vicious. You want a proof? There's no way you can feel you care a speck of dust about any character in the film, save for maybe some of the victims of the tough guy.

153,dcarp825,"Another Great Affleck Film, Brought Down by Oscar Season",8,13 January 2017,"I admit, I am a fan of Ben Affleck films. His screenplays are strong and cunning, his style is clean and beautiful, and are overall magnificent films. I went into this with anticipation and excitement, I left satisfied, but also slightly upset at just HOW good this Oscar season has been. This is a great movie, but its main flaw is what other competitors got SO right in the last two months of Oscar releases.To start with, Affleck does a masterful job of throwing the audience into the ""Roaring Twenties"". Every small detail is present and adds to the overall atmosphere. Whether it is the costume design, beautiful wide shots of undeveloped landscapes, or the true depictions of racial tension at the time, I was all in.The directing and performances were strong, which is typical when it comes to an Affleck film. There is no question that his technical skills as a director are outstanding. Car chases, gun battles, and brutal fight scenes are enticing. The only performance that was weaker than the majority was from Elle Fanning. As usual, the screenplay was concrete. Affleck spent a year and a half writing this. What he does get right is having the audience feel empathy for his and Chris Cooper's character. The dialogue was particular to the time and surprisingly funny at points. The overall theme begs the question, to have power, do you have to be cruel? His character's journey helps answer that. The main flaw of the film is character depth. This partly has to do with its release date. This is rolling out immediately after Oscar season films and into the usual ""January Garbage"" (""XxX"", ""Monster Trucks""). From a box office stand point, this makes sense. It will certainly turn out a profit (Studios need a 2.5x multiple of budget, which was $65 million) but it's biggest flaw is highlighted when films such as ""Manchester by the Sea"" and ""Nocturnal Animals"" NAILED character depth. There are a variety of interesting characters, but only Affleck's ""Joe"" is truly examined in depth.Another surprise is how harsh other critics are being with this movie and I think it has to do with expectations in this genre. The majority are going in with this expecting to be an all out ""Gangster"" movie, which is big shoes to fill (""Godfather"" and ""Goodfellas""). This is not what Affleck was going for. Sure, he has said himself that it is an ""homage to his love for gangster films"", but what it is at heart is a drama ABOUT a gangster. Our favorite gangster films embrace the brutality and evil that comes along with being a gangster, yet this explores the redemption and consequences of making that choice.Overall, I believe this would have been a perfect early April release for Warner Brothers. There would have been no competition (until ""The Fate of the Furious"" rolls around on April 14th and destroys the box office as usual) and it wouldn't have been piggy backing off of Oscar season, making its lack of character development not show like a sore thumb. Regardless, Affleck adds another great film to his portfolio and I am excited for his next project, Batman.",Live by Night
154,flowerpowerdr,"Live by night, what I loved and what I missed from the book! Spoiler Alert!",10,15 January 2017,"Live by night movie review!First I have to say I loved the movie, because unlike any other gangster movie it wasn't just about the gangster and the loyalty in the gang, it was more! It had contemporary problems of interracial hierarchy, and how each race struggles to prove that it is the worthy one! And how some fanatics try to destroy the other because they just can! Also it shows how playing good in a puddle of evil will make you the evil one to either side, that is why changing the rules of the game or life if that matters would cost you heavily! Being the boss of a killing mob will eventually either change you or make you lose all that is dear to you, so choose from the start, grey lines may be there but don't try to change the colors between white and black to suit your imagination! You could change the world around you to heaven ( as Joe did at the end) but only if you are completely honest about it, not crossing the lines every now and then! Apart from the philosophy, it had some great action scenery, the car chase, the hotel shootings, they were just fantastic. My problem was with Ben's wardrobe, his suits were the only ill fitting suits on set, he was practically swimming in them, also some close shots made his face so big! As for Joe's voice , it fitted the narrative although sometimes inaudible, but the voice over constituted about a fourth of the movie, sometimes I felt it is a documentary of Joe! There were some characters altered, the father didn't appear dissociated from the family and conflicted like the book, only one who comes to give his wise words and leave! Graciela, not a repel with a poor family, struggling to keep them off the ground, which would suit Joe from the book as he was a repel , who had his love killed because of his choices! But instead she was this nurturing home for a man who was tired of fighting, so she suited Joe in the movie more! Esteban was so plain unlike the book, where he was flashy, intelligent and caring! The scenes were sometimes too fast and sometimes too slow, which makes you some how perplexed but adds to the unpredictability of a somehow predictable gangster story, which I think was genius of the director.Ben retained the themes and philosophical quotes, also the visual breathtaking scenes and fights are there. But it is hard to follow those multi-directional stories except after reading their background from the book, and I think that what made people think this is a bad movie, because they didn't know where some of the characters emerged and where they go! He omitted two parts of the book which were just intriguing and which made me glued to the book in the first place, the navy ship blowing and the prison blackmailing by Maso!He didn't have the anger and rebellious character of a disillusioned army man, he was so calm from the start, no even excited to be a king of Tampa, so why go into gangs in the first place! In the book Joe was young and ambitious and once he knew the price of power, he gave it up! A key scene to this is the Maso kidnapping of Joe, in the book he was on the verge of dying and his gang saved him at the last minute but here he was the boss from the start! So the question mainly was : why take it (being boss ) and why leave it!This is not your regular gangster movie about mobs and crime, this is about why culture variability could be war and how we humans are the reason for igniting that hell, and thus our heaven on earth is a choice not a given thing! Verdict: Too many eggs in one pocket! But enjoyable!",Live by Night
155,jfjordan1947,Save Your Money & Do a Red Box Rental,7,14 January 2017,"I'm a long-time Affleck fan, & I like it when I can review his movies favorably (as I did with ""The Accountant"").Unfortunately, that is not the case this time. It's not that the movie is bad--it isn't--it just isn't that good either. It's a period piece, taking place in the 1920s & 1930s when rival mobs fought over the illegal booze trade among other illicit activities. It takes place in Boston & Florida, but mostly in Florida.The acting was good (Chris Cooper was especially good), and the period costumes & sets were amazing, but the movie's plot was thin. And of course, considering the theme of the movie, there's lots of violence & blood. The movie is an adaptation (the screenplay was written by Affleck) of a Dennis Lehane novel. (Lehane & Affleck are long-time collaborators, with the two of them collaborating on at least three projects that I know of, and I'm beginning to wonder if Affleck bought the rights to all Lehane's novels, including future books.)Because I am such a big Affleck fan, I try to see all of his movies on the opening weekend, hoping to contribute to his movies winning the opening weekend box office, which is so important in the entertainment business. As much as I would like to see this movie win the opening weekend's box office because it is an Affleck movie, I'm afraid I'd recommend that you save your money & do a Red Box rental or wait for it to be offered on Netflix or Amazon Prime.",Live by Night
156,utkonos9,Just no.,1,19 February 2017,"My thought process going into this was: ""It's got mixed reviews, but at least it will have cool cars and clothes and plenty of action, so how bad can it be?""I ended up walking out 45 minutes before the end, not because it was bad, but because I just did not care what happened next. The film is empty; utterly soulless. It's like watching over somebody's shoulder while they play a computer game (especially in the CGI-heavy car- chase scene, but in the CGI-heavy rest of the film too.)The acting is terrible. The main character has one single facial expression, and that's it. The dialogue is awful. The only good lines in the movie are lifted from ""Miller's Crossing"" and the only actor who seems to have any emotions at all is Messina.Scene follows scene, but there's no reason to care. Things happen, but completely at random, as though the screenwriter is playing a dadaist game with cut-up Boardwalk Empire scripts. Characters are introduced, and then blown off the screen a couple of scenes later, never to be seen again.Historical accuracy does not seem to be a priority, but the filmmakers don't seem to be going for all-out historical inaccuracy (in the style of Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby) either; they just seem to be incompetent. Salsa dancing in the 1920s? Really? 1970s pantsuits? I suppose I can't blame them for not caring.I don't care either. I don't care if you see this film or not. I just wanted to warn you how utterly meaningless it is. To paraphrase Dr. Narcisse (a memorable gangster character with cool dialogue played by a great actor): Go and see it. Or don't. Your choice.",Live by Night

159,spizby,"Live By Night, Sleep During the Film.",2,27 September 2018,"This film tried to be a classic. It had the huge budget. The mythic landscape of prohibition era America. The grittiness of an urban north-east immigrant melting pot and the exotic juxtapose of tropical Florida - then owned as much by the yokels who'd been pushed to the edges of civilisation, over generations of incompetence and ostracism. Now a deluge of new money, arriving with the gangsters who are attracted by the sunshine, the proximity to international shipping ports and the deeply corrupt local law enforcement and political establishment. IT HAD IT ALL but, sadly, this film ended up being worth far less than the sum of its parts. Affleck seems unable to recognise when a 'less is more' opportunity occurs. He can't tone things down and be subtle, ever. It shows a disrespect to his audience. A worry that they need everything explaining, twice. 
I love gangster movies, particularly prohibition era gangster movies. Al Capone, Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, The St Valentine's Day Massacre, The Untouchables.
So this film is more than a disappointment. I'd seen the potential and I knew that it could have been one of a very few truly great movies. Unfortunately, what could have been and what is are different things and this films potential never becomes realised. A great shame.",Live by Night

163,nizniktom,I'll be honest about this.,8,6 March 2017,"""Spoiler Alert""... Though, I'm sure the only spoilers will be regarding language... I remember when I first saw Gone Baby Gone. I really enjoyed it, for what it was. Then came The Town, one of my favorites By Afflek! I've only seen the Extended Cut of The Town, and recently found out there is a Blu-ray Extended Cut that runs a few minutes longer than the one I saw, will be watching it for the alternate ending..... Anyways, then came Argo-F*** yourself. That was the funniest part of that movie. But, I enjoyed it, greatly. And now, here we are, 4 years later, given Afflek's newest film Live By Night (which critics are chewing down) it was not a terrible movie at all. I didn't care for the uses of n***** in the movie, but it's not my choice. Second of all, for the ""Genius"" who did the Parents Guide editing, there were 63 uses of F***... go ahead, criticize me for counting. The reason I did was because when I first watched it, it said Language Through, and it seemed like there were hardly any f-bombs in it, well, there were certainly more than enough... like I said, it wasn't terrible at all, just not at great as his last few films, though this one (in my opinion) deserves a 7.0/10.0 at the least..... also, my opinion doesn't have to mean anything to anyone, just throwing it out there like everybody else likes to do.

165,thormint,Mixing movies and styles,1,31 January 2017,"Went to the cinema biased by a short trailer watched at home. I had some expectations with this movie and gave it many chances during the 2 hour ""thriller"". I tried really hard. It appears that Ben has been mixing genres. John Dillinger, The Godfather, American Gangster, Boardwalk Empire and lightened with some romance in the background. The result is Live by night. I will give them 1/10 because there is no 0/10. I will say some aerial takes are nice, and you also could save from the fire a couple of the interpretations from the cast. The problem with this movie is really simple, it doesn't match. You never get engaged with the characters or with the movie. Ben was incapable of managing the tempo, characters, history plot. For the first 20 minutes I could see something original in this movie. After the first half an hour I try not to hate it. Do not waste 2 hours of your life.",Live by Night

167,justinkeebaugh,I'm glad this bombed,1,23 April 2017,"I went to friend's to watch and from the trailers it seemed like a nice  little gangster movie. It starts building up as a crime/revenge story  and then out of nowhere it's like the movie ignores what it was  originally going for.  I'm gonna explain this... So Benn Affleck's character is head over  heels for this marilyn monroe look alike and then she betrays him. So  this mob boss beats him up and lets him go. Ben Affleck swears revenge  and then he starts by going to the Florida and then tries to find the  guy who betrays.  At that point, the movie just totally forgets all of that. So Ben  Affleck befriends a bunch of Cubans and agrees to start smuggling rum.  So then out of nowhere the KKK shows up (I'm not making this up) and  start harassing him. So he tries to make deals with them and then they  back down.  So then he like finds the sheriffs daughter is strung out on heroin and  then black mails him into letting him meet one of the KKK heads (they  even gave the dude a hair lip so we know he's in the KKK and LITERALLY  Hitler)so he can kill them. We're already like an hour into this movie  and it's already forgotten about the whole revenge story. So they try  to tie it in by saying the main villain paid the KKK to shoot up the  Ben Affleck's clubs.  So the KKK guys get shot and then they explain over a quick montage  that they ended up running the KKK out of Tampa. So then in the next  part of the movie Ben Affleck tries to open a Casino but the Sheriff's  daughter is back in town going on tour speaking against gambling, sex,  drugs, and all kinds of sins (this movie is all over the place). So  that's like 20 minutes of the movie wasted. The plot around her is  dumb, she kills herself after contributing nothing to the plot, and  then Ben Affleck goes and gets his revenge.  This movie looked like it'd be a cool gangster movie but it is not a  gangster movie. There is nothing more absurd than a movie placed in the  20s trying to tackle ""social issues"" facing society today. It was  trying to send a ""message"" that didn't really go anywhere and it's a  shame they tried to sell this as a crime drama. Terrible movie.  Leonardo Retardo and Ben Assfleck should retire.",Live by Night

She is and was so gorgeous in American Sniper and the way the maker artists did her in this film was an absolute travesty. I didn't even recognize her.
