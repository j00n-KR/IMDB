0,SnoopyStyle,some interesting performances,7,31 August 2015,"Marty Puccio (Brad Renfro) is a life long friend to Bobby Kent (Nick Stahl). The problem is that Bobby is a violent bully who is obsessed with gay porn and uses it to dominate his friends. Marty has sex with Lisa Connelly (Rachel Miner) but Bobby beats him unconscious. Lisa discovers she's pregnant and convinces Marty to take out Bobby. She starts recruits her friends Ali Willis (Bijou Phillips), Donny Semenec (Michael Pitt), Heather Swallers (Kelli Garner) and her cousin Derek (Daniel Franzese). The incompetent teens can't get up the courage and decide to get 'hitman' Derek Kaufman (Leo Fitzpatrick) to help.This tale of disenfranchised youth is quite compelling. The young cast is haunting. Renfro, Miner and Stahl are perfect at being these kids who are spending all their time drinking, smoking and going nowhere. This is very much like River's Edge. Director Larry Clark, who directed Kids, is leering a lot at the young people's bodies. The meandering plot and the aimless teens keep the tension not that high. There are some interesting work from the actors.",Bully
1,jboothmillard,Bully,6,4 October 2006,"From the same director as the incredible awful Kids, this is actually a good film. Not like a conventional teen movie, aka a teen flick or teen slasher, but a good film with dark teenage issues and realistic events. Basically Marty Puccio (Brad Renfro) has been bullied by apparent best friend Bobby Kent (Terminator 3's Nick Stahl) since they (pretty much) met, and he wants it to end. All his proper friends agree with him that he is a non-caring person, and I personally agree. He's just bad, because he drinks, shags and at some points rapes and beats people, not just Marty. So all the kids including Lisa Connelly (Rachel Miner), Ali Willis (Bijou Phillips), Donny Semenec (Michael Pitt), Derek Kaufman aka The Hit-man (Leo Fitzpatrick), Heather Swallers (Kelli Garner) and Claudia (Nathalie Paulding) decide to end it by a plan to kill him. The first attempt didn't work because of nerves, but the second time, they got him really good, or bad from whatever point of view you have. Based on true events, this really is a film that gets you thinking. Good!",Bully
2,rmax304823,Sturm und Drang,5,12 February 2003,"It's hard to imagine that a bunch of middle-class high-school kids could be so thoroughly dissolute that they would murder a member of their group because they didn't like him, but it happens.  This incident happened to take place in Florida, but there was a similar murder, a parricide, in San Rafael, California, that was written up in an interesting sociological way by somebody who's name now escapes me, maybe Levin or Franks.  I wish I could remember the details of that book because the two cases have so much in common.  Both took place in anomic bedroom suburbs nucleated around malls.  Both were prompted by irritation rather than immediate threat.  Both were initiated by young girls who instigated their boyfriends and others to commit the murders.  Both were sloppily thought-out and disorganized.  In California the kids tried to barbecue the bodies at an outdoor picnic site when they couldn't think of anything else to do with them.  In Florida they threw the body carelessly into a ditch.  What a picture of subsonic youth ""Bully"" presents us with.  Succulent teenaged girls, suntanned young men, none with any evident talent or purpose.  They drop acid, go to a mall, and try to ""fatalize"" characters in a video game.  They vomit on the street.  They pointlessly spit big ginders onto mirrors.  We see nothing of them at work or in school.  It's as if those spheres of endeavors simply didn't exist for them.  Sex is taken for granted, almost an irritant to be gotten out of the way.  Few of them talk about love, and the one young girl who does has no idea what the word means. They drive flashy new cars.  They don't think at all about the future. Their parents aren't stupid but just irrelevant.  They seem motivated chiefly by boredom.  How stupid can you get?  I'm green with envy.Why did Clark make this movie?  It's no improvement over ""River's Edge.""  It offers no insights into the minds of these kids.  Well -- how could it?  How could you suggest an insight into, say, a bowl of vanilla pudding?  The photography is B-movie level.  The violence in it is pretty realistic, although not up to the best -- that is, the worst -- levels that we've seen in recent films.  The sex is graphic.  ""Welcome to the party,"" says the Bully to a girl he's just met and pulls her head down to his lap.  Not to leave anything out, there are constant implications that the Bully is bisexual.  While the girl is going down on him his eyes are fixed on the normal act of coitus that his best friend is engaged in, in the back seat of the car.  Is that why Clark made this movie?  Because it's sexy and violent? The director must have convinced himself there was more to it than that, but the ""more"" doesn't amount to ""much more.""  He seems to have been happy with his control over the camera.  A girl is having a phone conversation and the camera drops down for a pointless peek at the crotch of her cutoffs, out of one side of which one of her glabrous labia droops.  Thrilling, but if this is really what a viewer wants to see, he or she could simply go into the back room of the local video store.  Another scene that will literally make you dizzy.  There is a rambling conversation among four or five of the kids.  They are standing in a circle around the camera.  And the camera pans around slowly as if on a pivot, regardless of which direction the lines are coming from, and it slowly spins and spins and spins, completely out of control, accomplishing nothing except to draw attention to the fact that there is a director named Clark who is causing this to happen. 
What a picture of youth.  When I was in high school, we were forbidden to use any cuss words, even the mildest, in front of girls.  Wow.  The movie doesn't blame the parents, at least.  That would be the easy way out, to explain the absurd semi-existence of these people, who seem to have skipped directly from infancy to jaded middle-age without ever having gone through the self-discovery of adolescence.  Blame the parents, right.  That's what ""Rebel Without a Cause"" did.  Gosh, aren't we misunderstood?  But this movie doesn't do that, perhaps because no one involved thought about explaining this life style, any more than the homicidal kids thought about how to dispose of the body.  Is this movie really such a piece of junk, though?  Well -- yeah, it is.",Bully
3,Quinoa1984,So stark in it's from-a-true-story fashion it borders on personal ground,8,26 November 2002,"There's something about the kids in Larry Clark's films, such as this, Bully, and his 1995 classic Kids (which took place in New York and had the feel of an un-interviewed documentary), where the characters are brought so vividly to life, and their contemplations and actions in their dead-end lives, that I get reminded of the people I was around back in my grade school days (I've been out of the public school system for six months now). I remember the lay-abouts, the complainers, the overly medicated, and of course I remember the bullies, laying on abuse that sometimes they weren't even aware they were inflicting.  Nick Stahl plays Billy, bully among a circle of teenage friends in Hollywood, Florida, and his best friend from childhood is Marty, played with striking intensity by Brad Renfro, has been daily receiving torment, if not with punches and slaps, then more on the mental side.  Soon, his girlfriend makes a suggestion ""he should be killed"", and very soon after that the circle of friends agree, and then it continues, along with a so-called hit man, a good small part for Fitzpatrick who was noteworthy in Kids.There will be some out there who may not be able to stomach the elements - it's unrated, not a bad move, and there are as many moments of sex as in a Cinemax soft porn and as many moments of smoking dope as in a Method Man/Redman production - but that's all part of Clark's overall effect, and he pulls it off like a true craftsman and not as a overly exploitation film-maker.  This circle of friends are a sad, hollow representation of the kinds of societies the youth of the nation inhabit, and the key is that it's correct, at least in such a banal suburbia.

4,wes-connors,"Kids with More Skin, Less Motive",7,15 July 2015,"While working together in a Hollywood, Florida fast-food eatery, surfer dude Brad Renfro (as Marty Puccio) and his kinky companion Nick Stahl (as Bobby Kent) meet two prospective new girlfriends. They are sex-starved Rachel Miner (as Lisa Connelly) and her skanky companion Bijou Phillips (as Ali Willis). The four teenagers are quickly copulating in a car. You know something else is up when Mr. Stahl looks at Mr. Renfro instead of his sexy female partner. Stahl likes it rough, and digs gay sex while he's playing it straight. Stahl likes to beat up Renfro and force himself on young women. He's a real big ""Bully"". The main problem arises when Ms. Miner decides she really loves Renfro, who has been under Stahl's control since they were little kids. Miner figures she can only have Renfro if Stahl is out of the picture...With all the sex going on, you wonder why there wasn't room for one with Renfro and Stahl...""Bully"" takes some time to figure out, unfortunately. Stahl's character must be gay or bisexual, as supposed in my short synopsis, above. In the actual film, this is far too subdued. This forces the viewer to waste time trying to determine what is controlling Renfro's character. Specifically, we wonder why he is bullied. There is no evidence of a cognitive problem (although he may have some learning disability). Since the film is ""based on a true story,"" it's surprising that director Larry Clark does not elaborate or even fictionalize. Far from shy, he shows acres of young flesh. Renfro seems detached from his sketchy character. Blessed with the villain role, Stahl is quite convincing. Miner is believable. Led by ""hitman"" Leo Fitzpatrick, from Mr. Clark's superior ""Kids"" (1995), the supporting players impersonate their types exceptionally...Stay tuned, as after the credits, an update of the characters' fates are shown.******* Bully (2001-06-15) Larry Clark ~ Brad Renfro, Nick Stahl, Rachel Miner, Bijou Phillips",Bully
5,Doylenf,"Makes the teen alienation of ""Rebel Without A Cause"" look quaint by comparison...",7,6 November 2005,"Surfing on TV I came across this unknown film (unknown to me, anyway), and was quickly drawn into the story despite the most unlikeable, mindless bunch of foul-mouthed, acid dropping teens ever brought to life on the screen. Only later did I find out this was based on a true story of an incident that happened in Florida among a bunch of fairly affluent high school dropouts given little supervision by parents and bent on self-destruction.Years ago we had stories of teen-age rebellion or alienation like ""Rebel Without A Cause"" which made a teen icon of James Dean. Here we have Brad Renfro heading a cast of relatively unknown actors but giving an intensely believable performance as a kid abused by his best friend (Nick Stahl), a bisexual sociopath and bully, with a taste for S&M who abuses all his friends for his own pleasure.When a gang of teens hatch a plan to clobber him, led by Renfro's girlfriend, the whole half-baked idea ends up with them barely having a well thought out plan of how to make the kill. They hook up with a ""mafia man"" (local neighborhood punk with a reputation for contract killing), who finds out at the scene of the crime that none of them are as tough as they bragged about when it comes to the actual kill. Strangely enough, you find yourself rooting for the hit-man character (Leo Fitzpatrick) who has brains rather than the hapless teens playing follow the leader.A chilling, disturbing crime story, laced with plenty of vulgar situations and casual use of foul-mouthed language, but honest in its telling of a very graphic murder committed by teens because of bullying and, it seems, an addiction for brutal video games. The teens are depicted as having mind-numbing stupidity, with one of them close to being retarded when he's on drugs.At the closing credits, the sentences meted out to each teen is noted on the screen, each paying severely for mindless murder and mayhem.Shocking tale is realistically presented and definitely not for the squeamish.",Bully
6,preppy-3,Exploitive but fascinating,6,24 September 2001,"Unpleasant film (based on a true story) of a bunch of high school and 20 somethings killing somebody because they don't like him. I didn't like director/writer Larry Clark's ""Kids"" and I refused to see ""Gummo"", but I did (sort of) like this. It's full of gratuitous nudity (almost all of it female), explicit sex, tons of swearing and extreme violence. The first half-hour of this is a trial--the almost constant female nudity was getting to me (the guys aren't shown that much) and the unerotic, disturbing sex scenes almost had me bolting from the theatre. What kept me in my seat was the plot and the acting. The plot is well-done and scary and all the acting was good. Nick Stahl is physically very unintimidating as the bully, but he has a very scary look to him and makes you despise his character. Bijou Phillips is excellent as one of the girls who helps plot his killing and Brad Renfro is just superb as the physically and mentally abused Marty. Also the last half hour is excellent. Very unpleasant but interesting. Next time, however, Clark should cut down on objectifying all his female characters.",Bully
7,The_Void,Excellent true story thriller,7,18 July 2004,"Larry Clark first shocked the film world in 1995 with the explicit and relentless 'Kids'; and that's the movie he has become known for, and will be remembered for. However, Bully is a superior movie in every way.Unlike Kids; Bully is not an aimless attempt to shock the population. It is evident throughout the movie, with the nihilistic view of sex and murder, that Larry Clark's main intention here, like with Kids, is to shock the viewer. But here the shocks aren't gratuitously over the top (with the exception of the actual murder), and because there is a plot, the shocks are allowed to become more shocking as we can care for what's going on, not just see the shocking images. Also unlike Kids, Larry Clark has put more emphasis on the characters and they are built up somewhat, unlike the cold shells we were presented with in Kids. Of course, the characters in this movie are based on actual living people and are not just works of fiction and therefore they are bound to have more depth.Bully is based on the true story of a group of kids that killed their mean friend in order to end their problems. The character of the 'bully', played to perfection by Nick Stahl, is presented in a manner that very much makes him the villain of the piece. However, at the same time; the bully is given a human element; it is obvious that he's not a true villain, but rather a sexually confused teenager and therefore, when he is killed; the audience is made to feel guilty for wanting him dead, and we can therefore identify with the other characters throughout their guilt. And this is a great thing for a movie to do; Bully takes us on an emotional roller coaster ride and therefore it is a hard movie to forget. Unlike Kids; we're not shocked by what we see, we're shocked by what we feel and this makes for some very uncomfortable viewing.The entire cast of Bully excels in their roles, and that's just another good point to add to Bully's already impressive resume. All characters involved are made believable and they all have their contribution to the story and none are lost within the film, and therefore, they all manage to stand out from the others.Bully is impressive in many ways; the story is presented well and we are able to care for it, it is well acted, well characterized and the direction is more than competent. Overall, Bully is a great, if uncomfortable roller coaster of a movie, and it is therefore recommended to those that want to see movies that break the Hollywood mould, and movie fans in general.",Bully
8,trashgang,Typical Clarck flick based on true events,7,6 July 2015,"Larry Clark and his controversial flicks. If you have seen one of his flicks you know what you will get. A lot of blah blah, teenagers having sex and go skating. Not that in, again, a controversial flick. This is the flick people liked the most coming from his hand because it is based on the murder of Bobby Kent. Two things make it controversial. Teens having sex, do smoke dope and are just hanging around. People will be offended by the nudity of the teens but Larry knew the law, they are all above 18. But they are all unknown 'artists' The second thing that makes it hard to watch is the fact that friends can influence each other to murder a good friend. That it all happened in real life makes it more weird. Just watch they way Bobby was killed...it's not for the easy offended. It's a rather difficult flick to watch due a lot of senseless conversations and the way they are talking to kill their best friend. It isn't filmed like a big production, it's Larry Clarck so shocking for some it will be.Gore 0,5/5 Nudity 2/5 Effects 2/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5",Bully
9,siderite,"Reall well acted, but the disturbing subject slow and boring",6,27 February 2011,"You have a bunch of kids, barely out of their teens, hanging together, having sex like bunny rabbits, popping children like crazy and getting drunk and stoned on a daily basis. Typical white trash. And one of them is a psychopath in the making who likes to torture both physically and psychically the people around him. That's why it is called Bully, see? So what's the solution? A huge and ridiculous public conspiracy to kill him. This is based on a book that is based on a true story.Well, the people in the movie played great. The movie is an independent film, with low budget, so all you have going for you is the story. And the story is disturbing, to see all these incredibly stupid people, wasting their life one way or another, acting all cool and emotionally numb. But it is really slow and after a while even the disgust and civilized outrage wear off and you get just as numb as they are: fracking kill him already! And they do, and then the movie ends.Bottom line: if you want to feel the moral and mental degradation of youth in poor industrial regions, do watch this. It is educational. But beside the instructional value of the film, there isn't much else there. Just a long wait for the movie to end and add it to your film belt.",Bully
10,StevePulaski,A dark and disturbing ride through the unjustifiable,10,17 June 2012,"The kind of teenagers depicted in both Larry Clark's Bully and his previous effort Kids are the kind that make my skin crawl. Idiotic, rebellious deviants that believe everything revolves around them and that nothing could possibly ever go wrong for themselves or their friends. Despite these despicable characteristics, Clark has made Bully a strangely sympathetic picture, putting viewers in a position to connect with the characters, learn a bit about them, and buckles them in to stick by them as they go along for this absurd and profoundly ride of sheer rawness.The film is an absolute adrenaline rush, combined with primitive, realistic editing, slick writing, a ton of heavily built up tension, and performances around the clock by actors you've never heard of, all blended together to create a reenactment of a chilling true story. The film centers around Marty Puccio (the late Brad Renfro) who is best friends with Bobby Kent (Nick Stahl). Bobby is a physically, verbally, and sexually abusive neanderthal Marty has been friends with since birth. The picture suggests he could be a repressed homosexual by producing homosexual porn and forcing Marty to dance at a male dance club, but such assumptions aren't the prime focus here.Marty and Bobby double date with Lisa Connelly and Ali Willis (Rachel Miner and Bijou Phillips), two young girls they met at their sandwich shop. Bobby and Ali seemingly connect, while Marty and Lisa strike a deeper friendship, one build on lust and sex. And there is a lot of it. Rather than jumping to the conclusion that director Larry Clark is a pervert, if one were to do research on the actual case of Marty Puccio, they would learn that the teens in question were always having sex, possibly to breed purpose in their empty, dirty lifestyles.When Bobby winds up raping and beating Ali, her, Marty, and Lisa come up with the idea to murder him. They band together a few of their friends, and hire an alleged hit-man (Leo Fitzpatrick of Clark's Kids) and decide to carry on. The consequences, regret, and mental stress that is birthed because of this decision is unlike any of them could've expected, and what follows is a series of suspenseful shots all leading up to the breakneck, sinister conclusion.Some will say that the idea to kill their friend because he is an obnoxious narcissist is stupid and pointless. Because it is. Instead of talking to Bobby's parents, bringing this up with the authorities, or talking to their own parents about it, they devise such an ingenious plan to kill the offender making themselves just as bad as the rapist teen. This is what the film is all about; showing how warped in a world of nihilism and ridiculous gratification these kids were - a recurring theme in Clark's pictures. While Clark's Kids is on another level when compared to Bully (it played more like a documentary on doomed degenerates rather than a true film) it's the depiction of instant, impulsive satisfaction on the teenagers' part that still acts as one of the central focuses. Their desire to feed inner demons, never considering the consequential repercussions of their actions. They do not contemplate their parents' reactions or how society will view them as a whole. The only thing that matters is when and where the event will take place and if beer and marijuana will be served.The film explodes with performances all over the board, from Brad Renfro's enthusiastic portrayal of Marty Puccio, to Rachel Miner's ""good girl gone bad"" Lisa, and, let's not forget, the wonderful explosion from Bijou Phillips that never tends to become unbelievable or overdone.After watching both this and Kids in the same week, I almost feel trounced in my optimism for the youth of today. Larry Clark has made two brilliant pictures depicting the disheartening corruption of teenagers, and has left few bright spots along the way. Bully is a disturbing picture, yet like Kids, one of many high points and of many high, high points. It again shows what harm the lack of parenting and artistic exposure will have on kids. The building blocks for a hopelessly lost adolescence is being raised without ever being exposed to challenging mediums, testing your mind and opinions, having careless, uninvolved parents who do not care what you're doing until something is clearly, seriously wrong, and mixing in the feeling of true worthlessness. The writing, again, is beyond commendable and at the end, you're left crippled, shaken, and possibly scarred. Larry Clark is a filmmaker for those craving a slice of honest pie.Starring: Brad Renfro, Nick Stahl, Bijou Phillips, Rachel Miner, Michael Pitt, Kelli Garner, and Leo Fitzpatrick.

11,=G=,A compelling film from under middle class America's rug,8,25 January 2002,"In ""Bully"" Larry Clark takes a bold, fascinating, and realistic look at an American subculture which has received too little exposure in film: the middle class teenage loser. While we've all seen films about  disaffected youth from ghettos and barrios with murder aplenty, little has been done since the ground-breaking ""Rebel Without a Cause"" to expose the seething socially sick segment of the monied middle class in denial about their sons and daughters for reasons of parental guilt. ""Bully"" takes us there with a beautifully shot but disturbing look at the young people who have the bodies of adults, the minds of children, the freedom of money, and lethal potential as they plan murder as casually as they would have sex or smoke weed. Clark walks the fine line between exploitation and reality courageously as the audience bears witness to a film version of a true story which has divided critics and audiences alike in opinion. ""Bully"" will be most appreciated by those who are familiar with the class of young people it portrays. Footnote: At this writing there's an interesting dip in IMDB.com's demographic (gender & age) breakdown of user appreciation in the middle...about where you'll find people of the age of the parents of the kids in this film. Denial or clueless?",Bully
12,paul2001sw-1,Crime and Punishment: the misanthropist's version,7,2 October 2006,"Larry Clark's 'Bully' is like a modern day retelling of 'Crime and Punishment', and based on a true story. Clark is the high priest of the art of debunking myths of teenage innocence, and he certainly does this here: the film tells of a gang who kill an obnoxious, bullying acquaintance, but with their callous disregard for all human life except their own, they're arguably even less appealing than their victim, while the soundtrack makes a strong, though unsubtle case, for considering hip-hop the music of hate. But while the story may be true, one wonders at Clark's motives for making this movie: is the film really indicative of teenage awfulness, or simply Clark's own misanthropy? Likewise, there's something distinctly prurient in the movie's denunciations of its characters' obsession for porn and sex. On the other hand, in spite of its repulsive cast and extreme storyline, to Clark's credit the film is watchable, plausible, and unsettling throughout. But I'd like to believe on behalf of my species that we're really not this bad.",Bully
13,MOscarbradley,Social documentarian or pedophile pornographer?,8,22 November 2007,"Disaffected American youth doesn't come much more disaffected than in the films of Larry Clark who shot to prominent notoriety with ""Kids"" and has never looked back. Social documentarian or pedophile pornographer? There is no doubt that Clark certainly likes to dwell on the nubile, naked young bodies of both sexes and prurience is never too far away but ""Bully"", while never skimping on the flesh quota, also posits a strong case for Clark as a serious film-maker. It's a disturbing, nihilistic work, all the more shocking for being based on real events.The bully of the title is the arrogant, sexually confused Bobby, (a brilliant performance from Nick Stahl), who beats up his so-called best friend Marty, (an equally good Brad Renfro), and isn't above pimping him off to older men. But Marty isn't his only victim; he treats everyone with equal scorn and ultimately rapes Ali, another member of the vacuous circle of airheads who populate Clark's picture. Finally egged on by the machinations of his vicious, addle-headed teenage Lady MacBeth of a girl-friend, Marty strikes back as the group kills Bobby and dumps his body in the local swamp. However, not only have they not thought this through but such teenage kicks are to be bragged about and it isn't long before they are all on trial for murder.By keeping adults conspicuously in the background Clark allows us to meet these kids up close and personal and he does indeed film events with a documentarian's eye, albeit a documentarian with an almost fetishistic devotion to his subjects. The long preamble to the actual killing is brilliantly done. And, at best, he can draw extraordinary performances from his young cast. As well as Stahl and Renfro there is excellent work from Rachel Miner as the instigator, Bijou Phillips and Michael Pitt. Perhaps by virtue of its subject this is Clark's most grown-up picture; it may also be his best.",Bully
14,helpless_dancer,Idle hands are the devil's workshop,8,30 May 2004,"Did these kids have zero supervision or what? Most of their parents walked around in a dream state as to what was going on in their childrens' lives. Apparently the brats were well cared for financially because they always had their smokes, booze, dope, and nice cars. The bully certainly deserved to have some serious ass-whup put on his worthless, perverted hide and so did his killers. What a worthless collection of sexual deviants, crybabies, and tough guy wannabes. This picture proves what I've said for a long time: if you want to kill someone; do it alone, bury the body deep, and never tell a soul - not even your own mother. These blabbermouths couldn't wait for even one day before they began spreading their evil deeds all over town. The stupids deserved their fate.",Bully
15,insomniac_rod,Education starts at home.,8,28 October 2006,"A true story with a social message. I can't truly see the comparisons with ""Kids"". In ""Bully"" it is shown that kids of upper social classes can also be a disease in society. The bully truly made some lives miserable but that isn't a justification for his murder. The acting is surprisingly good. A generation of new talented actors/actresses started with this movie. The sex scenes, or drug related material is very toned down compared with movies of these likes.The trial does not last as long as I would like, but still it's an important scene.

16,GOWBTW,This is the tops of all true stories!,10,8 May 2006,"I've seen ""The Onion Field"" and read the book, in ""Bully"" this movie takes a psychological turn for the worst. You would think a middle class neighborhood would be a better place for the typical American. No problems would happen there? Think again! ""Bully"" usually prefer to the outsider who doesn't do well in school and is a total outcast, well in this true story movie, the bully was a very bright young man named Bobby Kent(Nick Stahl) who abused his childhood friend Marty(Brad Renfro) and raped Lisa(Rachel Miner, Mac Culkin's ex-wife) and Ali(Bijou Philips). Bobby was a senior in high school looking for a brighter future, then he started hanging around dropouts and his father wouldn't like that. His father is unaware about his son's intentions,especially the way he treats his childhood friend Marty. Though the vengeful group take out the bully, it came with a price. I saw the sentences they received, I'm just glad that those sentences got reduced in a later report. This movie was disturbing, the graphic scenes made my blood boil, and the work was excellent. I don't know it would appropriate for psychology class, but it's best for research though. 5 stars",Bully
17,dee.reid,"""Bully"" (*****)",10,28 July 2004,"The teenagers viewed at the center of Larry Clark's ""Bully"" seem, at least to me, to really have nothing going for them. They have sex almost on a constant basis, drink, smoke pot, drop acid, and have reckless, meaningless lives. It might appear that ""Bully"" could possibly be a darker continuation of his 1995 outing ""Kids,"" which also focused on endangered youth, but I think the questions at this film's core run deeper.No doubt ""Bully"" will provoke outrage and controversy; those feelings are warranted, as they allow for intelligent discussion about the characters and events in the film. With this film, Clark's direction certainly seems a lot more focused, polished, and has much more outside appeal than ""Kids.""The story centers on Marty (Brad Renfro) and his subliminally sadomasochistic relationship with his so-called ""best friend"" since they were kids, Bobby (Nick Stahl). Marty is your average teenage surfer-bum. He's dropped out of high school and is constantly picked on by Bobby. Marty befriends and eventually impregnates his new girlfriend Lisa (Rachel Miner).Rachel sees and quickly grows tired of Bobby's constant humiliation of his ""best friend"" and suggests to Marty that one way to deal with Bobby is to kill him. So they call upon the ""Hitman"" (Leo Fitzpatrick) to help with the dastardly deed. From that moment on, Marty, Rachel, and several others embark on a path that is littered with boasting, lying, and guilt-ridden feelings about what they're about to do. No question that these teenagers get what comes to them in the end, and the build-up to that moment is quite intense.If there is one thing that people can agree on about ""Bully,"" it's that it is frighteningly accurate and true to life. The film, which is based on an actual murder that took place in 1993 in Florida, is quite authentic. Larry Clark even journeyed to the actual Florida suburb where the murder took place and the members of the film's young cast even take the names of those that were involved.The cast is perfect; not a single terrible performance. If there's one thing these kids agree on, it's that Bobby deserves to die. He's just a bully, and a rapist to boot, who does the deed for the cheap thrill of it. There is no question that Bobby is perhaps one of the most loathsome characters ever depicted on film. He may be a closet homosexual (he has an obsession with gay porn; he takes Marty to a gay bar and forces him to dance on stage while the patrons stuff dollar bills into his pants; and his violent actions towards Marty and Lisa could be his way of dealing with those repressed desires) and he is a sociopath who may have been pushed to these limits by his tough, but loving father. But look at the bigger picture: they're not killing him for the fact that he could be a homosexual; Bobby's murder is even more terrible for the simple reason there is no clear warrant for it. In fact, their actions aren't motivated so much by revenge, as it is jealousy. Most of these kids work low-paying jobs at fast food restaurants and live off of handouts from their ignorant parents. Bobby is on his way to college and looks to work with his father in their own business, which strangely enough, Marty takes up as a part time job.Like ""Kids,"" Clark makes good use of imagery. One of the film's closing shots says a lot more than a teacher ever could: Marty's younger brother stares sadly into his eyes, wearing a t-shirt that says ""D.A.R.E. To Resist Drugs And Violence."" Powerful imagery indeed. And also like ""Kids,"" he makes good use of people much younger than the main characters; they talk, drink, and act like adults, and they haven't even hit puberty yet.Much has been said about Clark's tendencies to zoom in on and focus on the anatomy of his young cast. True there is much sex and nudity in this film, but I think it's beside the point. Clark is simply trying to capture the reality of today's troubled youth - how sex and drugs are pitiful attempts at giving meaning to their lives.""Bully"" is an excellent exploration of the youth of today's dark and troubling times in America. Like ""Kids,"" it's a film that's meant for intelligent discussion, beyond the usual controversy and rage that's custom for movies like this.",Bully
18,meeza,Bullseye Perfect!,10,21 August 2001,"`Bully' is the best film you will see this summer! That is no bull****. The film is based on a true story about a group of teenagers who team up and murder an adolescent bully. This horrific event took place in Weston, a suburb of Ft. Lauderdale.   Larry Clark, who also made the controversial teenage rebellion 1995 flick `Kids', directed it. His work is masterful. The ensemble acting was `bullseye' perfect. Brad Renfro, who plays Marty the bullied-upon spacey surfer boy, was amazing. Renfro, who himself has had his troubles with the law, has become an `apt pupil' of acting and will definitely be a `client' of the most prestigious acting agencies of Hollywood. Rachel Miner, who plays Marty's girlfriend, was also very good and the `naked truth' (which she was in most of the film) about her is that now she has a promising future in acting. Miner, the ex of Macauley Caulkin, was in various sex scenes in the film and made you ponder that maybe she was not `home alone' when Macauley was out of the house. Nick Stahl, who plays the bully, was very convincing. Bijou Phillips, who plays the slut of the group, will leave images in your mind that will stroke you I mean strike you after the movie is over. Phillips, who is the real half sister of Mackenzie & China Phillips, will strengthen her career `one day at a time' until that one day where she will ` hold on' to be one of the best young actresses around. I know- Big Statement! This film is not for everyone! I have never seen so much sex in a mainstream film, and there is quite amount of violence. If this is not for you, I will not bully you and force you to watch the movie. However, in my opinion- it is a very important film that tells a very crucial story on how bullying could impact a young person's life. I am sure `bully' will push around its way into my top 5 films of 2001. ***** Excellent",Bully
19,Chris_Docker,Remarkable,8,13 May 2002,"(8/10) Controversial movie from Larry King (director of ""Kids""). No-one can quite capture/portray realistic teenage performances like this guy. Based on a true story of teenage bullying that gets too much and the kids gang up on one of their own. It has a lot more going for it than violence for the sake of it. As in his earlier movie, we see the adolescents having to face the responsibilities of their actions in a way that teenagers are often poorly equipped to do. We see them carried away by emotion, passion, all convincingly justified, but flying in the face of common sense. King's films might be one of the best tools we have for helping angry young people learn about themselves before it is too late. Sadly, they are classified 18 or often censored.",Bully
20,MarieGabrielle,Real...real film...tumbling down....,9,22 February 2011,"As another reviewer mentioned, this is not something for everyone, which is why I liked it. I don't gravitate toward blockbuster commercial mainstream movies. It also is shown often on IFC an excellent indie film channel, in a miasma of HBO and Showtime pablum routinely thrown to the audience.It was based on the true story of what happens to a bully, from his friend Marty Puccio, the strange relationship they had and how it ends up. Marty is well-portrayed by Brad Renfro (died tragically in his real life). His friend and somewhat dominant bully is Nicholas Stahl, who plays the part well. Good-looking but sociopath. Bijou Phillips and also Garner, the actress who plays the real Heather Swallers, is also worth mention. Rachel Miner is believable as an instigator, who does more than is initially revealed.The aimlessness and general malaise of South Florida is captured. Having lived there the strip malls, bored kids riding and partying in their convertibles, a lot of it is shown here without being trite. Rather it is startlingly fresh, like a scene where Bijou Phillips is talking to her mother while they are driving...""What if someone commits murder...what happens?""... . Her Mom then says ...""you mean real, like a real murder""...? . The denial and parents who are too busy with their own narcissism to even care what their kids are doing until its too late.As a character in and of itself, the town of Hollywood Florida is perfect setting, disjointed, some people with decent jobs, overpriced (now deflated houses thanks to the bubble and Wall Street). Marty is a lost kid, probably never will finish high school, there are no job prospects anyway. Nick Stahl is a kid who may get to college, or may not.If you like this story you may want to check out the book, its a real story, and this film is well-written, the actors turn in real and stark performances. Highly recommended. 9/10.",Bully

Besides one of the security officers at the final courtroom scene, I don't think there were any black people in this movie. I mean, I've been to Florida when I was a kid for Disney World, and I do remember seeing more than white people walking around Florida then. I'm sure Miami has more than 1 black guy walking around. Even though the story rotates around a group of lower middle class white kids, the limitation of having no ""black people"" even as simple background players, makes the movie ever more fiction than it is. The most amazing thing about the movie had to be the transformation of Rachel Miner's character. At first, Rachel appears to be Snow White. Pure as snow, beautiful and very innocent. By the end of the movie, she had gone from Snow White, to simply White Trash. An excellent acting performance which holds the audiences' attention whether or not she is naked. The nudity is one thing in Bully, the message is completely different. Don't watch the movie without getting the moral.",Bully
22,Jonny_Numb,A film that bruises like no other...,8,21 October 2006,"Forget ""Hostel."" Forget ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remakes. As a matter of fact, forget anything in the last decade that's been marketed under the banner of 'horror.' Larry Clark, director of ""Kids"" and ""Another Day in Paradise,"" wants to take you to the real-life school of Horrific Hard Knocks with ""Bully,"" a terrifying account of a group of teens who got sick of a peer's abuse, decided to kill him...and did.Bobby Kent (Nick Stahl--""Sin City"") is the loathsome titular character, a verbally, physically, and sexually abusive guy who takes out his frequent fits of rage on Marty (Brad Renfro), a life-long 'best friend.' Marty is sick of taking beatings, but is passive (and, quite frankly, pathetic) until Lisa (Rachel Miner) comes along, witnesses the abuse first-hand, and hatches the plan to kill Bobby. Eventually, a small group of bored, unsupervised suburban youths encircle Marty and Lisa and play a part in the horrifying murder that sits at the film's core.Clark's feature debut, ""Kids,"" was an aimless, pretentious, and self-consciously 'important' film; ""Bully"" is like that film taken to 11, with incredibly sharp focus. He deftly nails the nihilism of these dopey, bored brats, and presents the parents as utterly clueless drones who seem to exist in another world. The teenage relationships here consist of reciprocal drug use, noncommittal sex, and perceptions of life dictated by MTV. What adds to the climate of horror (which Clark brews at Bobby's first beating of Marty) is the fact that these kids are vacuous idiots who haven't the slightest clue what they're getting into. By comparison, Bobby--who is essentially unredeemable--is also presented as intelligent, and with some semblance of a future (we learn he's college-bound). Similarly, a ""Mafia guy"" (well-played by Leo Fitzpatrick), provides a strangely paternal sense of responsibility to the murder, yet isn't smart enough not to implicate himself in the proceedings. Irony is not a concept lost on Clark's presentation of these dead-end souls.While the director can't resist the urge to grease the film with lots of leering sex scenes, the effect bypasses exploitation and instead amplifies the grave nihilism at work. Clark applies a similarly unflinching eye to the actual murder, where the framing (with characters in mid- and long-shot), music (by Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore), and performances (a queasy mix of fear and excitement) are as raw, terrifying, and tormented as the on-screen violence. This is a rare film that succeeds in showing how ugly violence really is--not the sadistic, just-for-laughs slaughter of ""Hostel,"" but something closer to ""Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom,"" Pier Paolo Pasolini's unsettling exercise in death, degradation, and amoral perversion.Those with the stomach for ""Bully""'s excess will ultimately be rewarded by the thought it provokes. The film is controversial and worth discussing, but far from 'entertaining'--whether viewing it for the first or third time, the bruises it leaves are permanent. Bravo.",Bully

Eventually, when they all decide that he has gone too far with his abusive behaviour, words and character, they decided to lure him out into the woods one night where they each take turns beating and insulting him until they eventually kill him.

24,Movie-ManDan,Uncomfortable and Awesome.,9,16 January 2015,"Bully is based on the real life murder of Bobby Kent in 1993. Iconic Brad Renfro leads a cast of young upstarts in a movie that (I'm sure) does justice to the real case. If not, and the movie was changed for dramatic purposes, it was changed perfectly. Despite there being great acting by a great cast, the violence is gory and there's lots of explicit sex. So I recommend watching this alone. Honestly, the abundance of sex is a drawback.Brad Renfro plays Marty Puccio and Nick Stahl plays Bobby Kent. Marty and Bobby has been best friends since they were children, but Bobby has always mistreated Marty. Bobby has mistreated everybody in very disgusting ways that's all shown. Everybody gets fed-up with Bobby and all plan to kill him, with Marty being the most motivated.The characters get dumbed down after the murder in unrealistic ways that diminish the film. After the murder, they are sworn to secrecy and blab right away. Wasn't believable. Good thing that aspect doesn't lower overall quality by much.Renfro stated that Bully was his favourite movie of his. I must agree that it is his best he was in and the best he's acted in. So there's lots of sex among other things that make for an interesting viewing, but for a dark teenage crime-drama, it is a slam-dunk! As you might have guessed, Brad Renfro is the best in this and Nick Stahl is right behind him. There was something so awesome about Renfro in this that made his portrayal so sick and made me shake. That's right, Renfro did such a good job in this that he made me shake. Nobody else has ever done that to me.3.5/4",Bully

I saw on National TV like 2 years ago a part of this film but i couldn't finish it and never know the name of the film but a friend told me that when i talk to him about the film.Well lets comment about the film: Bully is a simple history of revenge but the director could do much more and bring to us brilliant scenes and of course the actors, most of them unknown but they are excellent in the film. The fact that is based in a true story makes Bully the movie that the parents most see and in a way this is very important.Bully is brilliant and i hope that you can see and enjoy this film like i did....

26,stensson,America is lost?,9,15 November 2001,"Another film which is hard to sit through, not because of the violence (although there is a rough murder shown) but because of the compassion and engagement for the characters. You can't hide from the feeling of growing terror in the minds of the teenagers, the feeling of heat in the Californian night and the sense of hopelessness. Why are these kids living? What do they have to look forward too?This is a film of life and death and Larry Clark has really done a masterpiece here. It's really much of 2001 in it and that's bad enough. The actors are very talented, talking in a way which is very far from Tarantino's clever lines and choreographed behaviour. This is just a dirty plot about terrible unhappiness and can be recommended to anyone who has doubts about our so called freedom, which threatens to make so many lives miserable.",Bully
27,Screen_Blitz,Frightening true story with a faulty script,6,27 January 2016,"Larry Clark, director of the controversial coming-of-age drama 'Kids', takes a turn into a darker territory of the coming-of-age genre, diving into the story of the infamous murder that took place in Hollywood, Florida in the summer of 1993. This film centers on high school dropout Marty Puccio (played by Brad Renfro) who was friends with a popular kid down the street named Bobby Kent (played by Nick Stahl) since childhood, and was dating a sweet redhead Lisa Connolly (played by Rachel Miner) who also happened to be a high school dropout. As Marty and Bobby grew up, Bobby developed a more sadistic side and began abusing Marty, physically and mentally; and was further more cruel to Marty's girlfriend Lisa Connolly. Fed up with his abuse, Marty and Lisa conspired with some old friends: Ali Willis (played by Bijou Phillips), Donny Semenec (played by Michael Pitt), Heather Swallers (played by Kelly Garner), and Lisa's cousin Derek Dzvirko (played by Daniel Franzese); to murder Bobby, with the assistance of self-proclaimed hit-man Derek Kauffman (played by Leo Fitzpatrick).When portraying a chilling story like this, it is important not just to keep it faithful to the real-life event but also give it an authentic touch; a task director Larry Clark slightly stumbles with. There is no doubt that the story is relentlessly frightening and spine-chilling because it is. The film does a solid job at conveying a disturbing atmosphere when depicting the cruelty of youth and juvenile delinquency, the story pulls no punches to shock viewers. As the plot developments, the story hits greatly on the nihilistic nature of the characters. The screenplay is the aspect that lies the film's flaws. The story portrays the teenagers as morbidly trashy with their constant experiments with drugs like marijuana and acid, which several sources have claimed to have been happening during the events. But then there is the explicit sexual activity and nudity that runs rather rampant throughout the picture, with nonsensical nude shots of Rachel Miner and sex scenes that are borderline pornographic. The scenes portray the characters in a more exploitative than realistic manner, and the depiction can be quite appalling for many viewers. Overall, this seems to be the biggest takeaway of the authenticity of the plot, though it doesn't necessarily hurt the story. The performances are fine to very least, Nick Stahl is very convincing as the tyrant and conveys the strong sense of cruelty in his character. Bully is quite a disturbing movie inspired by a true story that leaves chills down your spine. This is film is not bad, could really use a more realistic approach rather and probably a more powerful script. This is film is definitely not recommended for those under 17, mainly for its lewd and disturbing content which can be uncomfortable to sit through.",Bully
28,kevin c,CLARK IS A PERVERT,4,24 March 2002,"This is a much more cinematic film than ""Kids"", although not as good as the underrated ""Another Day In Paradise"".

29,ElijahCSkuggs,Great Nick Stahl vehicle...,8,1 October 2007,"BULLY could have been awful, and probably should have been awful. But it wasn't, and this is in large part due to its cast; especially Nick Stahl who plays the lead protagonist Bobby, an aggressive, sexually disoriented misogynist and suburban nightmare. Two friends, Bobby and Marty, don't do much with their lives: smoke pot, have phone sex with older men, screw the local girls, surf, drive around; rinse and repeat. Bobby, despite being Marty's longest friend, is a despicable bully, hitting and demeaning Marty at every turn, embarrassing him whenever he deems fit. It's only when Marty meets a new girl and finds partial love and acceptance does some light shed on his relationship with his supposed best friend. After a series of way unfortunate events, a plan is devised by Marty and his girlfriend Lisa: to kill Bobby and end his domineering ways once and for all. But when your life is absorbed by drugs and sex, how fool proof can a murder plan be? As the plan slowly comes to fruition, more and more of Marty and Lisa's immature friends are enlisted to help in the slaying, and before anyone knows it, they're all past the point of no return. Tons of nudity by teenage stars, plenty of awkward sex scenes, acid-dropping, pot-smoking; basically all the staple qualities of a Larry Clark film are in full view, and honestly, it works better than it did in ""Kids"". But this movie, all in all, was saved by the acting. Not everyone was great, but a few were, notably Michael Pitt and Rachel Miner. But Nick Stahl was by far the best actor in the film, owning every scene he was in. You hate him, feel pity for him, are disgusted by him, are confused by him, laugh at him and with him, and generally and consistently, are entertained by him. He's another fine character actor I just can't get enough of, and will assuredly be nominated for scores of awards before his time in cinema is up. Very good film not for the squeamish.",Bully
30,hall895,"Stupid, stupid people",3,25 June 2007,"Bully is based on a true story which goes to show that there are some incredibly stupid people in this world. Unfortunately the movie about these particular incredibly stupid people leaves a lot to be desired. Awkward dialogue, underdeveloped characters, amateurish acting...this film has those things in abundance. What it doesn't have is anything to really grab you and hold your interest. This is a movie which tries to be painfully serious and yet often ends up being completely laughable. The true story on which this film is based has movie written all over it. Maybe with a different screenwriter, a different director and a different cast this story could have been turned into something worth seeing. But this movie misses the mark completely.Anyhow, the story here revolves around a teen named Bobby, the bully of the title. Bobby continually torments his ""best friend"" Marty. Marty's girlfriend, Lisa, gets the bright idea to kill Bobby. So a bunch of perpetually drunk, stoned and incredibly stupid teens are rounded up and they begin to plot the murder. Of course these people are too stupid to plot much of anything and everything inevitably goes to hell. These wannabe killers are so pathetic in every way you may well find yourself rooting for the supposedly evil Bobby. OK, so he is a little evil but he doesn't deserve to die, certainly not at the hands of these clowns.So the movie slogs along with these idiots plotting the murder, while taking numerous breaks from their plotting to do lots of drugs and have lots of sex. It seems that whenever the screenwriters got stuck they just threw in another scene in which one of their female leads got naked in the hopes that would distract you from the fact that absolutely nothing was going on. Whenever the characters do take timeout from all their sex and drugs to actually speak so much of the dialogue is cringe-inducingly bad. Maybe it's the script's fault but some of the performances from the cast are truly terrible. In the key role of Lisa, Rachel Miner's performance is stilted, forced and completely unnatural. It's impossible to buy into her character. You can't even really see her character, all you see is a bad actress. Leo Fitzpatrick's performance as a ""hitman"" is hilarious. Unfortunately he's not trying to be funny, he's trying to be serious. There are a number of other less than stellar performances as well. Brad Renfro as Marty, Nick Stahl as Bobby and Bijou Phillips as Lisa's perpetually naked friend Ali are really the only performers who turn in reasonably decent work but they can't overcome the awfulness which surrounds them. It's a shame this movie is so bad because the story's there. Unfortunately this story fell into the wrong hands and Larry Clark made a mess of it.",Bully
31,stamper,I guess this is not for everybody,8,22 June 2003,"I am not a viewer, who is not easily offended (if I can be offended at all) and to be honest this film didn't offend me a bit. I must admit though, that it took me a while to get adjusted to the film in the beginning, due to the amount of sexual scenes portrayed. In the beginning it just felt like I was watching a soft pornographic adult film without any real story. This feeling I had though, faded away after 20 minutes or so, when the story of the film unfolded and I must say it did so nicely. Larry Clark and all of the involved actors (they were all cast brilliantly and performed very well) do a great job, keeping the story, interesting and thrilling. They have a little help though from the music department as well. I mean I did not notice a lot of musical score throughout the film, but in the two most important scenes (the kill and in the end) I noticed it, and it certainly helped make the scene better. All in all a great effort by Larry Clark (who'll never make it big time) and the actors who portrayed the main characters. I see potential with some of them and I think that they all can make something of themselves. If I was a director and I needed a few spaces filled, I'd definitely knock on some of their doors (as other director's will). Good luck to all of you young promises. As for Larry Clark, I'm sure he'll continue to do what he does and I'm sure I'll check out some of his other films.

32,Falconeer,Desperate attempt to shock induces only boredom..,3,7 April 2007,"After seeing ""Bully,"" i found it difficult to believe that this inept, supposedly ""shocking"" film was created by the same man responsible for the quite impressive ""Another Day In Paradise."" This reminded me of those ""evils of youth"" films from the 50's, like ""Reefer Madness."" Larry Clark, widely thought of as little more than an exploiter of teen angst, proved his directing capabilities in ""Another Day In Paradise,"" which is a far superior film to this. In ""Bully,"" the 'kids' are so over-the-top fu@ked up that it soon becomes hilarious. Clark never misses an opportunity to get in an exposed breast or ass shot, filming the teens having sex in every position, constantly doing drugs, like literally every second someone seems to be smoking a joint. We even get to see the young lead actress on the toilet, naked of course. IMO, these exploitative elements discredit the film from being a serious look at troubled American teens. Most of the performances were awful and stilted, (I guess it is hard to find someone with a nice set of boobs who can also ACT.) The film has the look of a cheap, made for TV effort, nothing too impressive in the technical department. The gruesome killing/throat slashing scene of the bully was right out of ""Saw II"", as graphic as possible; pure cheap exploitation. I don't mean to imply that I don't love sex and violence in film, as I do. It was just totally inappropriate for a film that is trying to be ""serious."" However I am sure this will shock some sheltered and very ignorant viewers that have never seen a quality film about teenage pain & confusion, such as Tim Roth's ""War Zone,"" but for those who look to the DVD section of Wal-mart as the only source of their film entertainment, I guess ""Bully"" will do the job. But I imagine anyone who has ventured out of the mainstream will find this to be total garbage. And I have nothing against Larry Clark. I have mentioned ""Another Day..."", and I also found ""Ken Park"" to be a fine film as well, which deserves a look if you can find it. ""Ken Park"" is a better film than ""Bully"" because the kids in that film were believable teenagers, who weren't really ""bad,"" or so totally screwed up. In ""Bully,"" the kids were just hilarious stereotypes, who behave the way a paranoid fundamentalist Christian imagines ""just how EVIL those kids are today...""

33,itamarscomix,Powerful and painful,8,14 April 2012,"Larry Clark's third film was his best received and, thanks to a more coherent plot and tighter script, it may well be his best, or at least his most watchable, though it isn't any less painfully blunt than Kids. Like Kids, Bully is generally about spoiled, privileged, obnoxious teenagers doing some very bad things - but this time Clark manages to get the viewers to sympathize with the little monsters, which leads to the irony that while Bully is more watchable and more accessible, it's also more powerful and more difficult to swallow. While Kids could be viewed coldly and detachedly as a document of decadence, Bully successfully draws the viewer in.This strong immersion in the story is achieved through the same hyper-realism Kids had. Unknown and semi-unknown actors deliver extremely naturalistic performances - Brad Renfro, Rachel Miner, Nick Stahl and Daniel Franzese are all frighteningly convincing in their roles, though the more familiar faces of Michael Pitt and Bijou Phillips, coupled with their slightly over-the-top acting, I found distracting.A word about the sexual content, which is a staple of Larry Clark's films and always serves an important part in their atmosphere. Kids was accused by some for being exploitative and promoting pedophilia; but the sex there was clearly meant to repel and disturb rather than arouse, and it did the job. On Bully, though, I feel like Clark may have gone a bit overboard, especially with some of the more outlandish sex scenes (Miss Phillips, in the bathtub, with hot candle wax...) and feel like some of them are there mainly to maintain Clark's reputation and distract from the story (though a few of them are very much an integral part of it).Overall, Bully is a fascinating and powerful film definitely worth your time, if you can stand the experience, and it should be viewed with an open mind and an empty stomach.",Bully

There is no way that they could ever get away with it. Are there not other ways to punish this kid? Reporting him to the police, pressing charges. That is how ridiculous this film is, it just doesn't make any sense. Nobody could be that stupid.",Bully
40,Bogey Man,Has a great potential which it unfortunately quite doesn't manage to fulfil like it should have,7,10 December 2002,"Larry Clark's Kids (1995) was a sensational film depicting sex, drugs, violence and AIDS among seemingly normal and well raised American teenagers. The film had plenty of the kind of nudity and ""sexual dialogue"", that the film got immediately in trouble with MPAA and BBFC in Britain. Still, no matter how explicit, the film had its important and universal message delivered without hiding anything, and naturally something like that could be expected from Bully (2001), Clark's film based on the real life event that took place in USA in 1993. The film is written based on the Jim Schutze book ""Bully: A True Story of High School Revenge"" and the writers are pretty unknown (well, not anymore I think) Zachary Long and Roger Pullis, but also the film's major flaws lie in the script and the characters.Some characters and events were changed for the dramatic purposes for this film but in a nutshell a bunch of 20 somethings girls and boys struggle in their life as there isn't anything else in their lives than video games, surfing, drugs, acid and most importantly sex and not a sign of any emotional and warm human relations. Marty Puccio (Brad Renfro) has a life long friend Bobby Kent (Nick Stahl) who abuses Marty in mental level and likes to humiliate him in front of others and is also not so willing to see him having anything going on with girls. Ali (the young model beauty Bijou Phillips) and Lisa (Rachel Miner) are also friends and get to know Marty and Bobby. Marty and Lisa start to date and this Bobby doesn's like at all. Lisa notices how Marty is abused and bullied by his best friend Bobby and in her anger decides to get rid off Bobby, in other words kill him. What follows is insanely straight planning of the murder as everyone they tell about the situation is willing to take part to the killing and Bobby doesn't know anything about it..The cast includes also Leo Fitzpatrick as ""The Hitman"" and Leo is best remembered for the leading role in Clark's Kids as Telly. Kelli Garner plays the drug addict teen Heather Swallers and Daniel Franzese plays the overweight Mortal Combat addict Cousin Derek. Sweet Claudia (Nathalie Paulding) is perhaps the film's only/most innocent youngster who fortunately is included in the film to make the contrast at the finale more powerful. The cast is young, very talented and natural.The screenplay moves the story at incredible speed that really makes the first 40-50 minutes of the film go as fast as any talented storyteller ever could. It is truly wonderful to see what kind of segments and montages film maker can create by clever editing and cinematography and Bully seen in home on video is still a very intensive experience and it all would be just perfect on big screen. The beautiful beach settings are shown very briefly and with fast edits to depict the teenagers' restlessness and the raising terror about which Bobby knows nothing about. The characters are introduced with ""Kids like"" sexually explicit dialogue and they all become from the very first scenes depicted as some pieces of flesh that are lead by their instincts and hunger for sex, not much else. Also the nudity which is plenty and female oriented, is shot very 'temptingly' with various close ups to depict the sexual passion the characters are struggling with. Some will definitely think the shots of female crotch and skin are too explicit but still they can't deny they're true and real.What is the most severe flaw in the script is that the characters develop way too fast and act so brutely it all starts to feel little unbelievable. When the kids decide about the killing, it really starts to feel unreal as everyone at the first moment accepts it and is willing to be there while the victim is going to be killed. Their lust for blood lives inside human nature but it is not well enough motivated in the script that how the teenagers are so willing and ready to accept this kind of horrible and calculated manslaughter so easily. Also, the kids start to talk about it before and after very loudly and to everyone they meet so it really makes me wonder didn't the writers want to think about the dramatic elements of the film in these parts, too.The murder scene is also pretty effective even though it could have been done even more powerfully and mercilessly but even now it is very harrowing and effective scene. It never gets gratuitously violent or graphic, the scene's impact lies in the mental side and how the kids start to finally understand what they are doing. Also the happenings after the act are important as the kids change, get anxious and most importantly and chillingly (and realistically) start to turn against each other in order to save their own skin. By this point the film's message is very strongly jammed to the viewer's face but the ending takes it still further, and very greatly so.*some mild spoilers ahead about the ending* The sentences the murderers got were and are very strict and definitely much higher than any viewer could had expected. In real life, some of the sentences were reduced but still they remained very strong. As the film ends with the original, very strict, sentences, the dramatic creepiness is very powerful as in the film's world, there aren't any lower sentences or reductions, and why should have because this film's intention was to dramatize the event in a way that it would never happen again and make it all as harrowing and powerful as possible. It is the point to show the most horrible results their crime resulted, whether or not they are the same in the film as they were and are in real life. *no spoilers*Bully is the kind of film that leaves you pretty much breathless even though it could have made you almost faint. If the characters had been stronger and the gaps in the screenplay filled, this would have been a very powerful motion picture. Even now it is among the most interesting and important films for long time, and naturally it makes me hope Clark could continue his personal line and make closer to perfect films in the future. 7/10",Bully
41,Majikat76,What do you do when there is a bully in the group?,7,28 April 2018,"Quite a film! Whilst not every action was true, the main parts were. Pretty sexually explicit, which may not be for everyone, I think I may have even watched a slightly cut version, this time viewing. That all helps build the picture of how the group were around each other and the build up to the 'plan'. Very much one of a kind, sexual, brutal and must have been one of Brad Renfro's last appearances on film.",Bully
42,Med-Jasta,Hiding behind reality.,1,3 November 2021,"People like to justify the more crude things in this movie. But I think what people don't realize is that it's not what's happening, it's how it's happening. The director is clearly going for shock. That's kind of his thing isn't it? The movie opens the way it does for the story? Or to be shocking? Then the next conversation is explicitly about sex. For the story of to be shocking? Then the scene in the car... This is all for the shock value. That's what the director does. But he hides behind ""this is realistic"" or whatever when it may be but the way he does it is over the top. Rubbing your face in something to make you feel uncomfortable doesn't really get your point across. When two people go to bed together and wake up in the morning you know they had sex. Does seeing them have sex add anything to the movie? Unless something happens during it, it doesn't.It's a shame because handled with some amount of tact this would be a good story to get out there for people to know about.",Bully
43,thebricks,One of the best movies I've ever seen,10,1 September 2019,"I first watched this movie when it came out. The murder happened in 1993 but from the cultural references I've seen in the film, it seems to actually take place in the late nineties. It's an excellent time capsule movie. Back then, only rich kids really had cellphones but it started to pick up in the early 2000s. You really had to be a doctor, working professional or party kid to have one. Even then, most people just found having one necessary considering what you got for what you paid. Beyond use as a phone, it couldn't do much else until the mid to late 2000s.I rewatched it today and it's still a compelling movie. Absolutely haunting. There is evidence some of these kids, maybe all were special ed, if they were portrayed accurately. Lisa Connelly sticks out, so does Marty Puccio.I think watching this movie, it really did make me question whether successful people should always be admired. It's a thing in America society to deify anyone who has a lot of money and act like they're saints. Bobby Kent's parents may have been well-off and the son a model citizen on paper, but he was a terrible person who stepped on a lot of toes. He didn't deserve to die, and sure, there were smarter ways for everyone involved to handle this situation. Most everyone involved should have been treated like juveniles. It's very obvious that many of them saw this as some sort of a thrill and went along with the hare-brained plot.This sort of thing is pretty much repeated to this day. Wayward kids fall in with the wrong crowd, try to live up to an image promoted by the entertainment industry, only to wake up to police dragging them out of bed, hauled in front of court, lives ruined forever. Even if you get out, you are a felon and have to explain what you did to every potential employer. Some people are smart and can differentiate between the good people and the bad people, others are sheltered and think every felon is a monster. It is what it is. Great film, one of the best ever made.There was one thing that struck me as bizarre and it's the very obvious fact that Pizza Hut was plugged so much in this movie. You know it's a plug because other stores and logos are covered up, but there are tons of gratuitous references to Pizza Hut, which is just bizarre. It reminds me of Hardees's endorsement of The Boys. Did corporate know what they were getting into when they plugged their brand in this movie?",Bully
44,The_Wood,10/10 Brilliant and Controversial,10,26 January 2002,"As a person who considers himself moral by nature, I must say I was quite put off at first by Bully.  But as the story progresses, and you realize just how messed up these kids are, the film starts to grow on you.  By the final frame, you are left shell shocked and disturbed.  Not very many films can do that and then make you wanting to come back for more.Nick Stahl is amazing.",Bully
45,Mr Parker,Wooly Bully,8,22 June 2006,"This is quite possibly Larry Clark's best film to date. It's a horrifying film that peeks at the world of these kids with very little direction in their lives and even less drive. They spend their days at the beach, drinking, doing drugs and having sex at almost every free moment. One in particular, is a complete and utter scumbag who the other kids decide to take out when they've finally had enough of him. That's pretty much the story but it actually manages to go a lot deeper than that and into the thoughts and minds of these kids. This plus the fact that it was based on true events make this film a painful experience to watch, each and every time.I have to give Nick Stahl a big thumbs up for his work as Bobby, the bully of the title because he is so loathsome in this that you sincerely grow to hate him for all the abuse he heaps on everyone around him. I hate to say it but if the real Bobby Kent was this much of a prick in real life, he had it coming. Nick Stahl gives a chilling performance and hits so many notes with it that you can only expect great stuff from this guy in the years to come.Everyone else is pretty good, especially Brad Renfro, Rachel Miner and Bijou Phillips (who plays her role just a little too convincing if you ask me). I think one of the best things about the film is the acting. Most of these actors and actresses I've seen in other productions and they all do quite well. It was actually interesting to see Leo Fitzpatrick (Telly from ""Kids"") in this as the so-called Mafia hit-man. He was actually damn good in this! There's one thing I have to say about this film. For me, I don't mind excess. Be it violence, sex or whatever. The one thing that bugs me about this movie are the unnecessary crotch shots and sex scenes. There's a shot where Bijou Phillips is on the phone and for no reason at all, they cut to a shot of her barely concealed genitalia for no reason at all (a fact which caused Phillips to confront Clark afterward). I don't want to come off sounding like some kind of prude because I'm as much of a pervert as the next guy but with Larry Clark, it just comes across as wrong. There's a lot of sex in this movie and the funny thing is, I'd say about sixty to seventy percent of it could have been dropped. That's my only gripe with the movie, it's just a tad excessive in the same way that his other creep fests are, most notably Kids and Ken Park. Whatever statement he was trying to make with this film was dampened by this.One of the things I love the most about this film is how everything slowly unravels after the murder. You can literally feel things coming apart and watching it feels almost like being in a building that is slowly collapsing with no way out in sight. This is where the actors do their best work and make their characters believable.This movie is definitely one to see. No matter how many times I watch it, it still disturbs the hell out of me each and every time. Very well-made, well-acted and well-done.RATING: **** out if *****.",Bully

47,Nemesis42,Strong Piece.,8,17 April 2016,"Very disturbing all up. More disturbing than the murder itself, or the activities of the bully, was my knowledge that they were going to get caught for the murder well before the point in the storyline when they did it.How foolish and clumsy can you get? The 'hit-man' guy was also foolish to even get involved. He should have sensed that these fools were just that, fools, and had none to do with any of it!So frustrating to see such foolishness. That was the disturbing part. Well crafted tension all the way through, some documentary like moments. Well placed music, diegetic and not.Only found out it was a true story after the fact.

48,Chaves7777,The Abyss,10,22 October 2007,"Is not easy to talk about a movie like ""Bully"". Maybe is because i'm young, or maybe is because the film be for me hard to digest, but whatever it is, i'm convinced that this movie is an urgent and sad must see.""Bully"", based on a book and on real facts, told us the story of two boys: Marty and Bobby. They know since children, and now, as almost men, they make home porn videos between them for sold it to gay men. Go to gay clubs to win money and too make erotic calls for gay, just for win more money and for fun. Marty loves surf, Bobby to be a monster. Bobby always dominate Marty as he want, he always beat him without any reason more than butter. But this going to change when Lisa, Marty's girlfriend, give to her boyfriend an idea: ""Let's kill Bobby"".""Bully"" is not an easy movie, as i say before, is kind of explicit sexually, but psychologically is really disturbing. Larry Clark smash up to us the reality gradually, and that makes it more deep and more than visceral than anything. Second by second, we see how these young people, with a life to handle, fall to an abyss with no return. That is the impressive thing of ""Bully"", is a tasteless movie with an important message to improve. This is the case of ""Bully"", Is it's atmosphere. Yes, the photography is not any novelty, but the thing is how is show to us. ""Bully"" have as a bottom scenario, a beautiful sundown. But is a hard and absorbent yellow color. Then the night fails, and is where the young people, but they are not studying, or playing something, no thinking about what to do, or at least not doing something, at least sleep (As i do much times). They are in the streets, being promiscuous sexually, taking drugs, having sex, or... ah, yes, maybe planning the death of somebody. Of course, this is not the general situation, but is happening, in all the world. I'm not any saint, believe me, but movies like ""Bully"" makes you wonder about that, at least just a little, and is why is so deep and powerful.Is not only the power and Clark's direction what makes this movie a Must See and a Masterpiece, is, of course, their performances. All performances are great, specially Brad Renfro (The funny boy form ""Ghost World"") and Rachel Miner (As the girlfriend of Marty).This is not a movie for just a public, is wide in it. It can be for people of the characters ages, for parents, for old, for young. Of course is not the unique movie that teach us things, but is an excellent and hard film for show to the world its situation. ""Bully"" is a film who takes some of the concerns of the young people, and relation it with the adults, with grown ones. We see in some scenes a really sad message, this is not only their fate, is the fate of much young ones. We see how some of the little children learn then how to win this kind of ""future"". This movie develop their characters fears, as any young have, as any person have, but this time that fears are concentrated in our past, in that big step to let the child world and take front to a world of pain and pessimism, contrary of child's world. Is about pressure, as much know the ""law of the fittest"". At the end, ""Bully"" is about that, is about a world that seems to be more near of fall into an abyss without return.*Sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any.",Bully

50,RockPortReview,Larry Clark Exploiting teen sexuality...again,7,27 January 2011,"Bully 1/14/2011Director and photographer Larry Clark's work is often controversial as it deals with teenage life and sexuality in a very raw and documentary like style. His first film ""Kids"" shocked the country and launched the careers of actors Rosario Dawson and Chloe Sevigny. ""Bully"" released in 2001 also features a number of great young actors such as Nick Stahl, Brad Renfro (R.I.P.) and Michael Pitt. Bijou Phillips also plays the role of a promiscuous party girl, the same role that she has played in every movie she appears in. This film is also loosely based on a true story of a group of teens from Florida.""Bully"" is a very dark and depressing story of a bunch of bad kids doing a bunch of bad things. It looks to draws more attention to it self for its blatant sex and nudity then for the story it's trying to tell. But when told with in the context of these characters it does seem to fit. Clark's work is often labeled as exploitive as he dives into to find the most intimate details of a young person's life (real or created) and throws it out there for everybody to see. This is story about a bunch of lost and morally bankrupt teens that get together to kill a bully (played by Nick Stahl). His character of Bobby is troubled and sexually confused; he's gay but is afraid to overtly tell people so he puts up a tough macho exterior to convince people otherwise. His best friend Donny (Brad Renfro) has been taking Bobby's physical and mental abuse since they were little kids and has finally had enough. **Spoiler Alerts***A lot of the story follows Donny's new girlfriend Lisa (Rachel Miner) who is quickly impregnated by Donny. She hatches the plan to kill Bobby after her friend Ali (Phillips) is raped by him. Sounds pretty crazy huh? This teen soap opera really doesn't want you to like any of these kids, but you do end up feeling a little bad for them. The absence of the parents or family members is a likely culprit for there misery as these kids go searching for love and acceptance where ever they can find it. Each of them follows one another without any thought of consequence or feeling of right and wrong. After the kids go through with killing Bobby, the guilt and emotional toll hits everybody and all are shortly arrested and jailed. After ten years this film already looks a little dated. But is it a good film? I would have to say not so much. Watch it at your own risk or if you are interested in the work of Larry Clark.",Bully
51,TuesdayThe17th,Based on a true story of suburban decay and confused youth,10,22 October 2020,"I watched Larry Clark's ""Bully"" for the third time last night. A movie like this gets better with each viewing because the older i get the more effective it becomes . now that i have a daughter of my own, this movie feels very surreal and even after all these years there isnt a filmmaker that can match Clark's downright miserable and raw look at underprivileged youth. While this film is vile, foul, and uncomfortable, it still doesn't compare to the filth of what is ""Kids"", Clark's first and notoriously famous first film. ""Bully"" is a better movie than ""Kids"" and is more contained in its story. It's not like ""Kids"" or Harmony Korine's ""Gummo"" in the sense that this movie follows a functioning storyline and has many known actors. This is the ""higher class"" of Larry Clark's work if you will. I really like Brad Renfro but I haven't seen much of him in film other than this movie even as the avid film goer I am so it makes me think he quit acting at a young age. Nick Stahl is also great in the role of the Bully and the victim. Its a polarizing look at the naivity of young kids and how one vapid decision as a youngster can and will shaoe the rest of your life. Think for a second about the kids you went to school with that made terrible choices, ended up in jail, or worse yet, ended up dead... These are often the result of young fragile confused minds attempting to take matters into their own hands. I remember being a teenager. I thought i knew everything. I thought i had it all figured out. Now at the age of 30 I think back and say to myself ""wow...what a kid I was"". The only problem with this movie is that I feel like Bobby should have had a couple more bully type scenes in the second half of the film. I get that he was mayne tryinf to do the right thing all of the sudden but then he goes out with Marty to get imto mischief so willingly, with a bit of bossing around to go with it. This causes the viewer to become sliiiightly confused with Bobby' s true motives and feelings. Bobby was also clearly homosexual which he was angry with himself about and this was most likely the reason for his brash behavior. His friends should have helped him come out of the closet instead of doing what they did. Lisa was the instigator and the coordinator and she was truly the bad egg of all the kids. Overall this is an eye opening film about kids. From the foul mouthed opening scene to the final frame. Deep.",Bully
52,faraaj-1,Waste of time,5,29 September 2006,"Larry Clark has an unhealthy fascination with teenage sex. We see lots of it in Bully. In fact, if Clark's worldview is to be believed, American teens have nothing else to do except kinky sex and smoking pot. That leads to very exaggerated plot developments. This supposedly ground-breaking and painfully realistic film is anything but. This may be based on a true story but isn't at all well directed. All the characters are one-dimensional caricatures with no real motivations. The entire murder motivation and planning is without any convincing rationale being given. This film just does not work for me because of the poor characterisations.",Bully

It is about bully and revenge. Both sides are guilty, but no excuse for what the end result was.This is the true story about Bobby Kent, a Floridan teenager who was a bully, rapist, and thug. He was killed by seven people, six were friends, the seventh was a hit-man. Although, it is never okay to kill Bobby's behavior provides the lesson that bullying is not worth it, and the ""Golden Rule"", ""Do Unto Others As You've Have Done To You"".The others should most certainly have not done what they did. It was certainly not worth it. Marty's sentence was communted to life without parole, Lisa's life without parole sentence was reduced to 20 years to life, she was released in 2001, the other girl was sentenced to 40 years, but has been released, the one other boy was sentenced to 7 years, the hit-man life without parole, the other two boys 40 years.

54,noizyme,Larry Clark's great movie about real-life killers and their personality problems,7,10 January 2005,"I, like tons of 20-somethings trying to relive their youth, picked up KIDS, the first movie from Larry Clark, a director who loves reality to the point of bypassing actual actors for kids on the street in almost every movie he makes. He loves crime and the demeanor of kids in their early stages of understanding society and people around them.In this movie, which is based off the book by Jim Schutze ""Bully: A True Story of High School Revenge,"" Nick Stahl's creepy role as ""Bobby Kent"" (portayed beautifully & gritty at the same time) is matched to Brad Renfro's ""Marty Puccio,"" an abused kid who never stops his friend (Kent) from running his actions and life. Because his parents are unwilling to relocate, Marty has to put up with Bobby's actions against him and even values him as a friend of sorts. When two around-the-way girls named Ali and Lisa come into their space (portrayed by Bijou Phillips and Rachel Miner, respectively), the two boys forget their roles of abuser and abusee and transfer their energies into each girl.Lisa becomes Marty's girlfriend, and though the group's closeness, they invite Ali over to sleep with Bobby. Bobby's persona, being already unbalanced and hostile, acts out on him in this particular scene in which he has rough sex with Ali and basically rapes her. So being the rapist and abuser that these kids know him as, they plot to kill him, but they still have their morals to battle with.I won't give away the ending (being that I've spoiled basically half the movie), but the feeling of the entire movie is why you watch this. that and the acting was pretty crazy and believable. I loved seeing Leo Fitzpatrick as ""the Hit-man"" in this film (he was in KIDS in his first role, also directed by Clark). I love, also, how Clark was willing to hire another guy (Daniel Franzese) based on the fact that he loved KIDS and knew KIDS verbatim (even though he explains on the DVD that he could actually deliver a line or two). The rape scene was a little tough to get through, but I, personally, have seen worse (buy ""Irreversible""). Also you get really creepy vibes if you've seen KIDS and then watch this because the director loves young-looking nudists in his films. At times, it's artistic, but when you seen Rachel Miner naked for the 10th time in the same film, you start to get the creepy vibes again.Again, Nick Stahl did a fantastic job, as did Brad Renfro (even if his roles are usually of this difficulty...playing a lobotomized friend). Michael Pitt played the doper-friend (I've liked his acting since ""Finding Forrester"") who was a major part in this even though you wouldn't think it would be. I liked the playful role of ""Heather Swallers,"" played by a Kelli Garner, who was cast a year later as a ""huffer girl"" in Todd Luiso's depressing ""Love Liza"" (so you can see the depth that directors cast he as).So go out and buy this if you're into cult movies with great directing and acting. Very stylistic and real.",Bully

Apparently, teenagers have nothing better to do than bump uglies, treat each other badly, take drugs, and have poor relationships with their parents. Someone call Revelations R Us, quick.Okay, so killing someone because he's not a nice guy isn't exactly reasonable, but I've heard of people being killed because they burped too loud. So if Clark is out to shock, he's failed.

And it does create a very creepy vibe and plausibility of these average ""nice normal"" kids doing something horrific. Which did in fact happen.But, sheesh, this whole thing is based on the account of the murderers. The guy they killed obviously can't give his account.Maybe he was a bully, I don't know, but these characters are hardly a paragon. Go talk to any murderer, and I'm quite certain they'll have all kinds of reasons the dude deserved it.As for the movie as a movie, the third act does contain a lot of great lines.

57,FeverDog,Why are we Americans so uncomfortable with sex but not violence?,8,8 October 2003,"I find it both funny and sad that the sexual frankness in BULLY creates more outrage than the depressing, brutal murder that the movie centers around. The bully got his throat slit open in the most graphic, unflinching shot in the movie, but all most people complain about is the nudity. Again, why is sex such a bigger deal than violence? These characters are amoral, aimless, drugged-out losers, but - shock! - they're naked a lot.  How unsurprising that most of those who complain about the nudity are Americans who can't handle honest depictions of sex but turn violent, pointless, emotionally empty action flicks into blockbuster franchises. (Am I the only one appalled that BAD BOYS II and 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS made so much money?)Yeah, right, Larry Clark's a perv for filming his cast without clothing for several scenes. But I remember another Clark (Bob) who had his young characters naked a lot too. Anyone else remember PORKY'S? Who of us took offense at all the nakedness in that movie?So, it's not the nudity that bothers y'all - it's the context. It's okay in a comedy but not a drama? I didn't find the nudity in BULLY inappropriate. Nobody was naked in public - they were alone with each other in the privacy of their bedrooms (as opposed to all the alfresco nudity in PORKY'S). I walk around naked when I'm home, especially after sex. In fact, I have more of a problem with movies whose characters get dressed immediately after coitus, or hide under the covers from the camera. It's a distraction because it's just not realistic. Good for Larry Clark for showing it like it is.",Bully

This film feels so real, so nitty-gritty, that at times, you may feel like an intruder, watching someone else's life. These children are so far removed from being children, it is hard to think that they actually are just children. After all, the concept of a group of kids killing their so-called friend, well, its hardly child's play now is it? The cast are great. Brad Renfro is top-notch in all his performances, here is no exception. Bijou Phillips is great, Rachel Miner is cunning, Kelli Garner is a lot of fun, Michael Pitt is slightly annoying, but entertaining nonetheless. Nick Stahl is intense, to say the least.Of course it would be hard to say you condone the actions of these ""kids"", after all, they murdered. But it makes for gripping drama. The film also reveals the sentencing which the kids received for their parts in the murder, some of which was very surprising. A great film, but you need to be in the mood for a hard-watch.",Bully

If it wasn't based (supposedly very accurately) on a true story, it would be hard to believe kids (and parents) are this trashy, ignorant, & self destructive. It's difficult to watch the graphic rape, nudity, porn, teen sex and bullying, but I understand the movie was trying to show how these kids were so casual about sex and had no self respect, dignity or skills to stand up for themselves. If it wasn't for the fact that it was true, I would've thought this just a stupid, explicit, gratuitous, teen sex film. On the other hand this movie can really open our eyes to how desensitized, ignorant and/or oblivious our society can be to the degradation caused by casual sex, bullying, drugs, teen peer pressure, violent video games, lazy parenting, etc. It's shocking how time after time we hear about kids killing and raping and how disconnected the parents are to the life their kids have been living. **Spoilers** This story shows a ""boy"", Bobby, who has bullied (mentally & physically) his best friend, Marty, all through their childhood. He rapes and mistreats other friends, and is finally killed, through mob mentality, drug influenced, ignorant revenge, but there is so much more to the story. Although this movie is centered on the teens I was disturbed by the parents who give their kids cars, money, no restrictions, and who turn a blind-eye, just letting their kids waste their lives away, hanging out with other deadbeat friends, doing drugs and not giving them any expectations, rules or building blocks to life and self respect. I was frustrated that the parents are so oblivious to their kids cries for help...like the passiveness and ignorance of a mom who lets her daughter hang out in her bedroom (door closed) with boys and girls, doing drugs, making out...and plotting murder; a son who comes to the dinner table in only boxer shorts, with a bruised face and begging his parents to move away from this neighborhood and they just yell at him that they aren't moving; a teen girl who's parents take care of her baby while she runs around half naked, hanging out with friends, having sex, and doing drugs; and the one parent that seems to be hands-on, trying to set expectations and goals for his kid, does it in such a forceful (bulling) way, with no care of the kids thoughts or feelings, that he drives his son to act out his lack of control and frustrations, out on his friends. It's unbelievable and shocking! There are lessons to be learned through this movie, but I doubt that the people who need the lessons would watch or understand. Because of the content (full nudity, sex, rape, porn) you can't really show this movie to kids and it's even too hard-core for teens. Maybe it will further open up the eyes of some of society to what is happening out there in some families, but I'm left with the question...what can we do about it?? The main lessons are to be engaged/involved with your kids! Listen! Be aware!! Don't conform to society... Don't let them do things just because ""everyone else is doing it""...like going to unsupervised homes, dressing slutty, playing violent videos, being disrespectful... Parents do have more control over teens than they think...take away privileges: their cars, their phones, money they don't earn and enforcing curfews & restrictions. But the key is Love and Respect and to be involved and hands-on when they are young. If you instill respect, empathy, compassion and self-esteem from when they are babies, you won't have half as much trouble with them when they are older...I digress... anyway, I give it 3 stars for all the nudity, sex, porn, and disgusting content but 7 stars for the truth, grittiness and showing the mentality of these people and situation. I know it's contradictory, but I guess I just want to warn people that it is an interesting story, but definitely hard to view and not for everyone IMHO! March 2014",Bully
60,imagiking,Bully: Paedophilic Nonsense,1,13 March 2011,"I recently saw Mean Creek, a film dealing with much the same core idea as Bully presents. The ever-interesting idea of comparing and contrasting two thematically similar films was my primary motivation in the decision to dedicate my time to this film, evidently a more visceral and uncensored treatment of the subject. Within one minute, my heart had sunk: ""A Larry Clark film"" appeared upon the screen. I recalled immediately my viewing of Kids, a film to which I had rather looked forward when I finally got around to watching it, and a film which I found to be nothing short of genuinely offensive, not an experience I often encounter. No, I am not offended by graphic sexual scenes, language, portrayal of drug use, or any such thing. Rather, I am offended by a film so morally vacuous and repugnant, and direction so perverse and borderline paedophilic as to be almost stomach-churningly awful. Nevertheless, I am not here to comment on Kids, but rather to take fresh judgement to Bully. I convinced myself to approach the film with a fresh and unbiased mind, and not to let my opinion of the director's debut feature shadow my potential appreciation of this, his third. The very first line of dialogue, considerably too lascivious to repeat here, informed me that it was simply not going to go well. It was ever before the thirty minute mark that the ability to sit still left me, my limbs in constant motion as though struggling to escape, sweat streaking my brow in pained discomfort. To quote the screenwriter who went on to insist his name be removed from the film, it is ""revolting, offensive and childish it much more closely resembles a porno. Unbelievably gratuitous sex, no story, zero motivation, no character development..."". And that, dear reader, from the man who wrote the film. As with Kids, Larry Clark's directorial signature appears to be to shove his camera between the legs of a female lead, whether she be clothed or not, because we need full view of a character's underwear as she sits down. Of course. The gratuitous sex of which the screenwriter speaks is no understatement, few shots devoid of some glimpse of youthful flesh, an apparent preoccupation of Clark. So much can me said about the utter moral bankruptcy which accompanies such contemptible film-making, but I have limited time and word count, so along we must move. The latter two points of the aforementioned quote are key to the film's stupidity. The murder rationale comes in the form of ""like... um... so... we could kill him... like... totally... cool..."". I do not care what mysteriously impressed critics may say, this is not a scathing portrayal of modern teenage lifestyle, of middle-class America, or of laissez-faire parental influence. This is garbage. Not one of the seven characters involved in plotting to brutally murder a friend (who, incidentally, is neither intimidating nor the least bit believable as an omnipotent and omnipresent force of terror) consider for one moment anything other than this course of action. This is not how real people function, no matter what the ""based on a true story"" tag may postulate. I find it immensely hard to believe that not one of the seven saw a problem with immediately resorting to cold blooded murder, but hey, this is Larry Clark's vision of the world, so some gratuitous sex scenes in the place of character development, realistic dialogue, or any sort of cinematic artistry will do. Speaking of cinematic artistry, as we're here, no Larry, a several minute long shot of the camera spinning around a circle of faces is not impressive, it's idiotic, but that's hardly a surprise coming from something with your name affixed. A quick mention needs to be made of the parents in this film, namely to wonder where the hell they are. They seem content to allow orgies occur in their homes, to allow their futureless children to drive about unquestioned in their cars, to provide easy access to firearms. Look, I know that people like this exist, but they are not the same people who are portrayed as concerned about their children, as these parents are. Again, the world of Clark is populated by characters almost as morally bankrupt, disconnected from reality, and inherently imbecilic as he. The man is nothing but evil, those who adulate and applaud him fools who have mistaken his perversion for art. Terrible films are one thing, but terrible films which dress themselves in a veil of artistic merit are so utterly and entirely ghastly, meretricious, obdurate, errantly dowdy, ignominious, opprobrious, and an infinite number of such synonyms as to make me want to find the person responsible and have them punished in the most severe manner possible. Larry Clark deserves a fate far worse than that of his characters combined for this pseudo-intellectual genuinely questionably perverse and dangerously-close-to-paedophilic kitschy ostentatious crap.So far removed from any form of morality that one can hardly manage to cry out in despair, Bully is mindless trash of the highest order from a man with the directorial flair of a pancake. Were it not for the fact that I detest him and his paedophilic nonsense posing as a serious treatment of a serious topic in a serious medium, I think I would pity him, for so distanced is he from any form of reality. I cannot begin to fathom how such a deleterious assault on cinema itself could possibly have been conducted without genuine intent of simply offending everyone unfortunate enough to encounter this garbage. Do not allow yourself to be counted amongst this group. If you want a film dealing with the bully psyche and dangers of fighting fire with fire within this context, please watch Mean Creek. If you want to see a genuine exploration of teenage attitudes towards recreational sex and drugs, why not try Bertolucci's The Dreamers? Anything is better than Bully, and I really do mean anything.",Bully
61,howie73,Hyped-up digital video experiment,6,24 March 2005,"A companion piece to Larry Clark's earlier Kids (1995), Bully is based on a true event, that of a murder in Florida in the 1990s. Utilising digital cameras and the director's favored cinema verité style, Bully dramatizes this true story as a hyped-up digital video experiment in reality TV. It feels like a home movie at times, one with the necessary roughness to portray the dark world inhabited by those Floridian teenagers.The acting is very good from all concerned but at the same time the film feels exploitative much like an afternoon TV movie with less noble intentions. Nevertheless, Bully is a refreshing change from usual true-life adaptations.",Bully
62,Hawkensian,"Though the film has an engaging murder plot, it's overshadowed by repugnant characterisation.",6,28 August 2012,"'Bully' gives the viewer an insight into a group of maddeningly awful young people. They communicate in ways that is an affront to the English language; their diction is an ugly mess of incessant swearing and pseudo-ebonics that's punctuated with an exasperating misuse of the word 'like'. Worse than their lexicon is their degenerative lifestyles – they're lazy, feckless, horribly ignorant and amoral. They've become so rotten, warped and stagnant whilst living in their scummy Floridian microcosm that they seemingly think their behaviour is acceptable. Well, they probably haven't considered what's acceptable or not as they don't *think* about anything. The film, which is based on the true story, starkly reminds the viewer that there are people out there who are this scuzzy and revolting.I wanted to hate the film because I hated every character, but the characters were clearly purposefully constructed to be that way. To hate the film for its ugliness could be deemed as missing the point, it's a depiction of extreme adolescent degeneration, I suppose it's something of a cautionary tale. Its chief success is how it portrays the ugly messiness of violence; it covers a spectrum of emotions from its characters during the visceral, realistically unpleasant climax, a scene that's very well constructed by the preceding twenty minutes or so.However, Larry Clark's trademark perversion is all over this film, paying gratuitous attention to the bodies and sex of the teenage cast. It's ultimately rather one- dimensional; its narrative of murder is captivating, but its study of reckless, idiotic culture is quite suffocating. Its absence of any somewhat relatable characters and presence of many detestable ones overshadows the film's acting and engaging murder plot.Although it does deserve a degree of commendation, there is ultimately little incentive to watch this film. 'Bully' is another lurid Larry Clark film that smacks of attention seeking.62%www.hawkensian.com",Bully

64,Captain Ed,A disturbing look at a real-life murder,7,7 May 2003,"""Bully"" takes us into the world of bored, spoiled, and shiftless Florida teenagers who murdered one of their own friends for reasons which, on the surface, seemed complicated.  Larry Clark, and the book which he virtually used as a shooting script, get below that surface and show us the monsters that the teenagers became.** SPOILERS **Bobby Kent, played brilliantly by Nick Stahl, is a harsh, violent teenager (20 in real life) who regularly humiliates and assaults his friends, especially Marty Puccio (Brad Renfro).  Bobby and Marty and their friends don't do anything in life except get high, have sex, play video arcade games, and listen to rap music. Marty's girlfriend Lisa, on the receiving end of Marty's violence, determines that Bobby is the source of Marty's rage and killing Bobby would leave Marty free to be loving and kind towards her. She enlists her friends and even her cousin, but when she chickens out, she gets help from another teenager that they believe is a gang-banger.  The next night, the seven of them go out and brutally murder Bobby, stabbing and bludgeoning him and leaving him to die face down in a swamp.""Bully"" gives a realistic portrayal of wasted and ignorant youth, addled by drugs and an overly permissive environment, and the interaction between the characters feels very real.  The second half of the film in particular is very haunting.  You want to reach through the screen, slap them, and scream, ""This is not a game!  WAKE UP!!""  Larry Clark ends the film brilliantly, using the musical score to set up the collapse of the conspiracy and bringing us into the courtroom for the first hearing.  As the conspirators bicker, accuse, and laugh, the parents and the community sit back and look at these children as if for the first time, aghast.  This is not to say that ""Bully"" is without flaw; it has plenty, and they will alienate audiences.  The casting of Rachel Miner as Lisa Connelly is odd, although Miner does an excellent job.  Lisa Connelly was overweight and somewhat unattractive at the time she was going out with Puccio.  This is, in fact, one of the primary motivations behind her desire to kill Bobby and keep Marty.  Miner, who shows up naked over and over again, can hardly be described as either overweight or unattractive, and her ferocious attachment to a loser like Marty is hard to understand.Another issue is Clark's unrelenting use of teenage sex throughout the first half of the movie.  It seems like all the girls are undressed more than they are clothed, and it feels very much like exploitation.  Especially reprehensible, and superfluous, are two close-ups of Bijou Phillips' crotch. (Supposedly, Phillips was outraged by them when she saw the final cut.) You need some of this to understand the state of mind, but this was way over the top and it takes away from the movie.Lastly, for a film which really tried very hard to stick to the book -- whether the book stuck to the facts is another argument, as it assumed conversations and states of mind -- Clark oddly jumbles the end up.  The scene where Marty is arrested actually happened to Derek Kaufmann (credited as The Hit Man, I suppose to avoid confusion with Derek Dzvirko, Connelly's cousin).  Ali's tantrum and demand for an apartment happened before the murder.  Connelly's mother and Ali's parents both hid their kids out in motels prior to their voluntary surrender.  And Clark neglected to include a crucial meeting between Connelly's family and their first attorney that pointed out how bankrupt the families were in forcing their children to take SOME responsibility for their actions, both before and after the murder. In fact, Clark makes Lisa's mom look like she was the only one willing to do that, when in fact at the end she was the worst of the bunch.Overall, I would recommend both this movie (at a 7) and the book on which it's based.  The performances are almost universally excellent, and the story needs to be told and understood.  Larry Clark needs to quit crossing the line over into exploitation so that more people can see him when he's brilliant.",Bully

Based on a true story, the first half of ""Bully"" follows a bunch of American teenagers, who are only interested in smoking pot, surfing, playing Mortal Kombat, driving around aimlessly, having unprotected sex, and generally behaving like losers. One of them is a particularly nasty piece of work, bullying and harassing people around him. The bully though is the only one showing any kind of social ambition, and also coming from a middle-class family. All the other kids are more or less lower-class social outcasts. Ouch. This part of the film is boring, unrealistic, contrived and completely stereotyped.Angry at the bully, the other kids decide to kill him. Erm, OK. What happens before the murder scene is totally unrealistic in a funny way, but the murder itself (by far the highlight of the film) manages to raise genuine suspense and involve the viewer. In the end, for reasons best known to themselves, most of the kids involved in the murder tell other people about it. OK.Amidst all this nonsense, the parents are completely absent, living in their own world of everyday jobs and financial taking care of. They only appear near the end, complying with the law and shallowly maintaining order in a society that is in a state of crisis. That seems to be the message of the film.

To have that many people involved and try to somehow say it was a self defense situation is the stretch of all stretches.

The problem (or benefit) to Larry Clarke's film-making is that the scenario becomes uber-real.Here the casting and acting are all top-notch. Everything about the grimy, swampy Florida suburbs are elucidated to the outside world, giving us a look at the crappy lives of these dead-beat teens. None of the lifestyles here should surprise you if you've spent much time in a podunk beach town, or a crappy strip-mall-infested slice of Americana. But as previously said, the casting and direction is a little too authentic.This movie is much better than Kids, because it doesn't feel like a pederast obsession and highlights a more explicit event. Thing is, Clarke's movies always feel kinda creepy and I wonder if the dude doesn't have an unhealthy obsession with this grimy, broken youth culture. He seems to have really strong nostalgia for his experiences of living through it. It doesn't surprise me that Leo Fitzpatrick, a character here and in Kids, also worked with director Todd Solondz. In ways, Solondz makes me think of a cross between Clarke and Woody Allen's darker, clever moments.This is worth watching.

73,cafesmitty,"Underlying Evil of Apathy, this is Bully",7,20 April 2008,"Everyone comes from this film a bit effected by this film. It's a story about suburbia's kids committing a heinous act. What I got out of this film was that suburbia is the problem. When you have non-define, sterile neighborhoods with nothing to offer but strip-malls, the kids will get apathetic and small problems turns into full blown disasters. This story is all about the complete disconnect between parents and kids. That even if the parent is ""available"" the hands off, let your kid do anything approach, doesn't work. I think there has always been an underlying evil to these ""so called"" planned closed communities. They have no identities, therefore the kids have no identities. I think the last scene of the movie sums up the movie. The scene where all the kids are sitting in the defendant's box and the parents all sitting in the stands with the complete look of perplexity. In fact they seem so disconnected from their kids as if they are looking at a used car. They seem as if they accepted the fact that they threw away their kids. And that understated acting by the people who played the parents has been overlooked. Sure, the actors that played the kids were great, especially the actress that played ""Lisa"". She was so convincing as a lost team with no sense of direction in her life. This is a remarkable movie that I think parents should watch. I have to warn you, there is a lot and I mean a lot of nudity. Now all the actors who did expose themselves were all over 18, but it still made me uncomfortable because they all were playing ""young"". Now the nudity and simulated sex scene are important to the story to drive home a point. That horny stupid kids make stupid decisions and perhaps if they weren't living in a disconnected state known as suburbia, maybe they would be better off. So, Bully is not a movie for everyone.

75,rsmolin,So Close to Reality That the Reviewers Were Shocked,9,28 March 2002,"Just finished reading the book and must say that the film follows it very closely. The movie got a bad rap from most reviewers who were clueless about the story and appalled by the sexuality. But what you see on the screen is about as close to reality as you can get. It took a lot of courage to make this movie. A few major omissions--Marty and Bobby were absolutely sick kids who would seek out mentally disturbed boys and throw a football off their heads and try to catch it. They did this many times. What a scum duo they were. Lisa was very heavy in real life, over 250 pounds. Also, Bobby would lie on top of Marty while they watched gay porn. What a strange couple they were! The book points out that Marty was digging the gay scene, and Bobby would beat the crap out of him when he got too gay! Yet paradoxically, it seems to have been Bobby who initiated all the interest in male sexuality. What really went on in their bedrooms as kids growing up? AND, most important, the film doesn't discuss the boys' use of steroids, which they took every day while pumping iron at a local gym. They worked out for two hours each session. I think the steroids certainly affected Marty to the point that it brought out all his hatred and viciousness for Bobby. But, the film is really very honest and fair in its portrayal of their lives and their demented scheme to kill someone. Don't you believe for a second that Marty and Lisa are celebrities--they were really messed up and in no way are role models. This film is disturbing, and of course it has to be, as it presents a fairly disinterested view of the ugly side of humanity.",Bully
76,RaulFerreiraZem,Bully,3,3 December 2019,"Yet another moralistic anti drug propaganda.
No teenager acts like that, the portraits are overtly exaggerated to the point of being ridiculous.
The film excuses its anti-teen sex anti drug agenda by saying that it was based on something that actually happened but that does not excuse the movie. Not one bit. The way that the story is told suggests that the reason why Bobby was such a violent person was because of his closet homosexuality, and that to me reeks of homophobia. Not only that but rape scenes are presented as a direct consequence of him being gay ( or at least bisexual ).
Anyways its just one of those 2000's movies where some 40 year old director tries really hard to convince other 40 year old viewers that their kids are awful and that the reason why they're awful is because they smoke marijuana and have casual sex.On a side note the whole conclusion feels absolutely rushed and unreal, the relationship between bobby and marty lacks substance. Not only that but the way the movie films women really shows where the film is coming from. So in one hand it treats casual sex and drug use like the worst things ever to happen to western civilization, on the other the film indulges itself in extensive crotch shots and female nudity in sexualized contexts.

There, the motivations and backgrounds of the protagonists could have been more thoroughly explored. As a dramatization, there are just too many characters for the really interesting thing - the psychology behind such morally vacuous teen mob behaviour - to be satisfyingly explored.  The gap is filled with a few falteringly written expository scenes - Marty sobbing to Lisa on the beach; Heather giggling about her awful home life - which try to show the emotional torture and moral emptiness which might lead to such criminal lunacy, but succeed only in sounding contrived.  Generally, the cast make the most of what their given: Nick Stahl is great as bully-boy Bobby (though the character is underdeveloped) and Brad Renfro as Marty is particularly convincing (as he always is).  It might not be pleasant, but with its relentless cycle of nudity, profanity, drugs and sex, `Bully' is at least compelling.  I'm just not sure I'm any wiser for having seen it.

Also starring Rachel Miner as Marty's girlfriend, Michael Pitt as a drug dealer, Bijou Phillips as a skank, and Leo Fitzpatrick as the hit-man directed by genius Larry Clarke (ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE, KIDS). Marty is constantly being bullied by Bobby and he is sick of it and decides to set a plan in place that will take care of Bobby for good. Bully is a violent movie as most of Clarke's movies are. ""It is taking it to far"" according to the public, Although the film seems to be about teenagers hooking up with each other for casual sex, taking drugs endlessly and thinking of ways to pass the time I believe it is a masterpiece. Clarke is trying to tell the public what is happening to the youth of today, these things are not pretend they are going on in our world. Nick Stahl delivers a chilling performance as the tormentive, violent abusive friend who is being pushed into his father's idea's for his future also conflicting with his sexuality. Rachel Miner plays Marty's girlfriend Lisa who wants to see Bobby gone once and for all, and Leo Fitzpatrick plays the Hit-man who is chosen to be the person to end Bobby Kent. Bully is a story of one kid being pushed over the edge and taking matters into his own hands. Pros Clarke's brilliance, exceptional acting, realistic, masterpieceCons ummmm nothing",Bully
79,bobbyelliott,Serious movie - shown without comment,8,8 March 2002,Great acting. Good pace. Interesting (and true) story. Adds up to a good movie. The acting deserves special mention - it was truly outstanding. The movie tells its story dispassionately - but there is a message within it - that children left to their own devices will grow up to be dysfunctional adults. I gave it 8/10. Highly recommended.,Bully
80,tgtround,Exploitation Movie Pretending to be ART,2,20 May 2002,"Whatever Larry Clark's capabilities as a director, this is as exploitative as anything which has come out of The Valley or Milth Berton's empire.I honestly don't know how Mr Clark can justify using and abusing a cast who are quite obviously as f***ed up as the characters they play. The effect is that of a voyeur.",Bully

82,buchass,Larry Clark best movie.,7,29 April 2007,"""Bully"" have impressive acting,its very realistic and brutal, its a film about slackers, bad persons, violence, drugs, sex, that affects teenagers, not only in U.S.A but in the all world, the normalization of violence its a subject very explicit in the movie. Its the story about teens that don't do anything and don't have any objectives in their life's,..""Bully"" its a strong portrait of nowadays society, in special the wealthy society...I think that Bully its the Larry Clark best flick, much much better then ""Ken Park"", ""Bully"" in some ways its better than ""Kids"" (Larry Clark first movie), in the terms of acting and narrative..If you like ""Bully"" i recommend:""Kids"",""Ken Park"", ""Teenage Caveman"", ""L.I.E"" and ""River's Edge""..",Bully
83,surfandski,"Absolutely brilliant, but you must have a stomach for it",10,17 November 2002,"You know you are in the hands of a top director when a familiar worn out theme, teenage alienation and murder, seems completely new and fresh. Larry Clark is not a guy that makes pleasant films, he makes films that suck you in, he captures you against your will. Bully is the story of teenage alienation, of a sadistic high school bully and his victims. The performances of this talented and known, but not famous, cast is outstanding across the board. This is one of the best cast of young actors ever put together. The realistic portrayal of murder, its consequences to its perpetrators, and the environment in which these teenagers move is something so rarely seen in movies that it makes it even more blatant how much crap we are fed by the commercial Hollywood machine. This is not a movie for everyone, there is lots of sex scenes, and Nick Stahl's bully characters is so despicable that you can barely stand it. The scene of young teenage boys dancing on stage for an adult gay crowd makes your skin crawl. I have to believe that anyone trashing this movie is because it attacks their sensibilities, rather than denying the absolute power of this film. This is writing, acting, and direction at is best. Once of the top 5 movies I have seen this year. Don't miss it. 10/10.PS I wonder why HBO insists in showing great movies at 2 AM. Goes to show what the mainstream is watching.",Bully
84,Fortressofdoors,A truly awful film,3,30 June 2019,"I couldn't decide which was the worst part of this film. The soundtrack, the cinematography, the bad acting or the script. It was a total mess with almost all of the characters being brain dead and having the most mind numbing dialogue I've seen in quite a while, it was like watching a poorly made for TV after school special. It's laughable that people refer to this deck as outstanding, incredible, amazing, etc. Their standards in film making must be pretty low for this to be considered such a great movie. The nudity didn't really bother me. There was so much of it that it became like background noise after a while. This movie is just plain ridiculous.",Bully
85,Curtis G.,Brad Renfro is an ACTOR,7,8 September 2003,"In a nutshell: Disturbing, yet compelling. Should I feel bad about having enjoyed it? I feel like I should. At least I know now without question what Larry Clark is all about (not that I didn't already know after ""Teenage Caveman"").While Nick Stahl was convincingly despicable and even Leo Fitzpatrick seemed more real than real, Brad Renfro OWNS his role as Marty. He was just so natural in the part that I can't help but think that, if he keeps making the right choices, he'll one day be considered a ""great actor."" One can only hope.",Bully
86,andrewhumphreys9968,Bully - 8/10,8,4 September 2020,"Similar in a lot of ways to KenPark and Kids in that it's centred around sexually promiscuous, violent teenagers, but I'd say this is the most conventional film out of the 3, especially considering it's based on a true story. Bully follows a group of troubled teenagers who hatch a plan to kill one of their friends, Bobby, played by Nick Stahl. Stahl is great as the titular Bully and the film goes above and beyond to make you hate him. I wanted him dead just as much as the protagonists, but the seriousness of the situation didn't really hit me until they finally went through with it, which is similar to what happens with the characters. This is helped in part by the very disturbing scene that most of the film builds up to, which was as visceral and gritty as you'd expect from a Clark film, maybe even more so. All the actors are pretty good and there's a few recognisable faces in there, including Telly from Kids, Leo Fitzpatrick, and Damien from Mean Girls, Daniel Franzese. The characters themselves are also interesting and they all fit into the story nicely. The film takes a second to get going, but it's worth it and only stutters slightly at the end. It's not as iconic as Kids, or as shocking as KenPark, but it's still pretty disturbing and fits perfectly next to Clark's other films surrounding bleak youth culture.",Bully
87,iraz,A realistic account of teens in America,10,24 April 2006,"I am a Larry Clark admirer. He makes very realistic films that are not for everyone. I have seen ""Bully"" many times because I find the story intriguing and the acting and storytelling are excellent. I have also read the book. As you know, this is based on true events. Mr. Clark follows the book very closely, to the point where the dialogue from the book is used exactly as written in the movie. The portrayals ring true, which adds to my fascination with this movie. He does go slightly overboard in some shots of the actors, particularly Ms. Philips who is quite beautiful.I recommend this movie very highly, just be aware that it is quite graphic at some points and is therefore not for all individuals.",Bully
88,Polonius85,"Brutal, explicit, but very well done",7,6 January 2012,"Bully is a chilling movie that shows just how low humanity can stoop. That a group of people can devalue human life so much as to see murder as a perfectly acceptable way to rid themselves of a problematic person in their life is an eerily true, and tragic occurrence that we see all too often. Bully explores the worlds of both the murderers and victim in one such a case from a no nonsense, blunt point of view.I was surprised that I liked this film as much as I did. The acting was very good, the character development was extremely well rounded, and the story progressed at just the right pace. The film subtly shows all the options the Broward County Seven had other than murder. They could have walked away from Bobby, they could have reported him to the police, they could have talked to him...they could have even scared him or threatened him. But, lacking any true moral compass, they decided that killing him was the acceptable answer.The way the characters were portrayed was very realistic. They were neither complete stone-faced, horror movie villains nor were they shown as heroes ridding the world of the scum that was Bobby Kent. The audience both hated and sympathized with both Kent and the Broward Seven.Now, the downside. I think that there was too much explicit sex that was unneeded in the movie. It really didn't enhance the story to show full body nudity, and I found it distracting. Yes, it did help to show that the Broward Seven were indeed lowlifes themselves, but still...anyway, I guess I just won't watch this movie with my kids! All in all, a great true crime movie. According to interviews with the real Broward Seven, it was pretty accurate, so kudos to Hollywood for getting things right. If you've got thick skin and a strong stomach, it's a very interesting movie.",Bully
89,centropolis,this hurts.,10,16 July 2001,"This is a movie that hurts. It's a good flick, it just hurts. Larry Clark likes to make people dizzy and sick to their stomach. He accomplishes that no prob bob in this movie. Nick Stahl and Brad Renfro were pretty good in this movie...David McKenna(Blow,American History X) writes a good, believable script. Watching Stahl rape Renfro's girlfriend while watching gay porn was a little much for me though. Not recommended for people with light stomachs.Brad",Bully
90,Club Kid,The best movie of 2001!!!,10,20 February 2002,"""Bully"" is by far the best movie i saw in 2001! Larry Clark is the most talented director of our time! he is a genius! Like ""kids"", Clark creates a raw, and believable world for us to watch. I loved this movie especially the performances! Bijou Phillips is so under used in film today and it was really good to see Clark use her and put her up to her full potential. i was plesantly surprised by Brad Renfro's performance here and I'm happy to see him doing such good films now. yes, the film is disturbing. i will admit that. but clark takes us into the lives of these kids and shows us that it could easily happen to any kid. as far as language and nudity goes, there's a lot of it in this film, all to make it more realistic. all in all the best film of 2001! i loved it! p.s. i also loved seeing bijou fully naked!",Bully
91,Cacus7,A terrific film about the consequences of the modern youth culture,9,15 October 2002,"I watched ""Bully"" simply because it was the only movie on TV that I hadn't yet seen.  By the time the final credits rolled, I felt luckyt that I had caught the movie.  This picture is not only a commentary on crime and punishment, but also on the neo-urban-youth culture that pervades modern America.  The acting is superb all-around, and while the plot provides no sudden twists, it is a captivating story.  Somehow, this film manages to make you feel empathy for both the murderers and the victim of murder simultaneously; mixed emotions are just one of ""Bully""'s strong points.  I highly recommend this film!",Bully
92,reel_emotion,Realistic or Not,6,16 August 2003,"""Bully"" is one of those movies that can be seen as either realistic or exploitative. Sometimes I had the feeling that it was just sensationalism. Another movie with its doomsday warning about the horrible nature of today's generation. Yet thinking back on my high school days I did know morons like this--people can and will be cruel.***SPOILERS***Something keeps this movie from being truly a good movie. I suspect it is in the character development and motivation. More of something needs to be seen as to why Bobby is hated so much or why Lisa worships Marty so much. We are told Bobby is a bully who deserves to be killed, but he only seems slightly more mean than his peers.In defense of the director's, Larry Clark's, crotch shots, I think in much of the movie he is trying to show us what these teens see--maybe give us an idea of what it's like to be a young male full of hormones. And in the scene where they meet with the mob wannabe guy and camera follows them around in a crazy, fast circle that makes the viewer want to vomit, maybe Clark was just giving us the feeling of being wasted on drugs in the middle of the day. Clark wants you to see how muddled the teens are in their thinking.The ending of the movie is quite good when the teens spill their guts about what happened--and that does happen in real life with homicide. It is reminiscent of another true crime story movie, Boys Don't Cry.",Bully

Movie was made some 10 years ago but still has a strong stamp as i can relate to it. I graduated with no clear sight but to earn good. In doing so, neither i have any plan nor anyone who can guide. Teen age life is different where you think you know everything but in reality it is not. We all know that. But, still we all make mistakes which we regret throughout whole life. Bully shows us the same. Simple bunch of teens with no clear motive in life but to enjoy time plans a crime, rethinks that, gets the help, execute the crime and life is never the same again. One murder is committed but it ruined 7 lives.",Bully
95,fluna1030,Very Strong Motion Picture!,8,18 October 2005,"If you have teen-age kids (ages 16-20), I strongly recommend this motion picture. ""Bully"" gives an insight (and a strong one at that) as how some teens get mixed up with ""the wrong crowd"", and some of the things they do without mom & dad around. As I watched, it gave me a view as to how some teens can be controlling & domineering & how they deal with it. It makes one wonder how quickly lives can be changed from one instance to the next. Since I have daughters, a friend suggested I see this. I must say that after watching this, I now make it a habit at staying in touch even more with my daughters. Again, if you have teens, watch this movie. After which, you'll understand why it's so important for parents to stay & keep in touch with your kids & who they ""hang around"" with.",Bully
96,imyjr,Tough little movie,10,27 July 2001,"This is a tough little movie with nothing to say beyond what it shows. It is riveting and sad. It is well written. The acting is superb. It's really an ensemble work....the interplay between the characters is masterful. Standout is Brad Renfro who brings eloquence and subtlety to a difficult role. The actor becomes the part, it all flows from a committed core. Not far behind are Bijou Philips and Michael Pitt....... real naturals. The movie sticks with you after you leave the theatre. Quite sobering. A note on sex: there is a lot of it, but it's never prurient or titillating. It's always to the point. It's pervasive, provides motivations, and creates ambiguities never fully resolved. No cheap thrills here.",Bully

But after seeing Bully for probably the 10th time throughout my whole life, I'll probably check out all of Nick Stahl's films. The late Brad Renfro also has strong emotions, especially the part where he's in shock and starts blowing spit bubbles. I recently found out Brad Renfro was supposed to be Will in 2003's ""Freddy Vs Jason"" and wow, instead we got something stale, but that's a whole other film... Lol",Bully
98,Oreolove,Almost too painful to watch,2,5 May 2002,"After reading the book, I thought they would at least clean up all the sex and drug use a little bit. Nope. They showed it all. I realize that all of this is true, which makes it even more scary to think that these kids could do this and think they could get away with it. Although, it probably sounded good at the time, since they were doped out of their minds. The acting left something to be desired. You wouldn't think it would be too hard to play a stoner, since that's what most of the kids are. The story begins when Marty's girlfriend gets sick of watching him get beat up by his best friend, Bobby. So what's the best solution? Why.... kill him, of course! What other explanation could there be? And who took the last of the weed? Frightening, isn't it? The whole movie is based around sex, drugs, and harsh language. I know that most movies contain this, but this one takes it pretty far. A little too much reality for my taste. I'll hang around my highschool if I want to see this stuff.",Bully
99,Gretchen_X,From mostly awful to totally awesome,7,17 June 2016,"At some point during the first half of 'Bully' you're going to think about abandoning it. The kids are consistently irritating, banal and two-dimensional, the premise very shaky, and dissonant events in the plot unbelievable. It seems to be heading toward another 'What you did last summer' disappointment.However it's well worth getting over the hump and into the dark and interesting places it takes you. Although the viewer is probably ahead of the game, the kids in the movie don't yet know that it isn't one. We feel dread in advance, which somehow elicits more sympathy and pathos.What was initially fanciful turns out to be incredibly realistic, and that's because (which I didn't realise until the end) it's based on a true story. Things ARE chaotic and difficult to organise into a narrative and the truth has many faces. And the devil is in the detail.Some of the reviews here talk about the gruesomeness and violence. In fact the murder scene is over quite quickly and it's not of the horror genre. The real horror is in the reaction of those involved, as you would expect. Sexual content has been another reviewer issue, but I'm a grown-up and don't see it as gratuitous, more of a illustration of the hedonistic lifestyle. I didn't fully understand that until the end however.The biggest criticism I have is the soundtrack, which makes you feel like it's a film for kids and you shouldn't be watching it. Some of the sounds are intrusive and grating; perhaps that's the point, but I don't think it does the movie any favours. It's not a film just for the teens, although at first it might seem like it. If you like unpleasant surprises, handled well, Bully is definitely worth a watch.",Bully

The actors definetly pulled off the realisation of the real people who actually lived that life and committed the murder.I sat there literally feeling sorry for the real Marty who apparently had to go through that pain and the only way to stop the pain for good was to kill his best mate Bobby.This film definetly sends a message and that's the way Larry Clark likes it.This film is definetly one of my favourites and I can't wait until it comes out on VHS/DVD.Simply you just have to go see it.",Bully
101,ArchObler,People are naked in this movie,9,9 October 2002,"Bully is relentless and powerful. In the first half it really shows how people can consume drugs and sex in mindless, destructive ways. And then it becomes almost a sort of black comedy, as Leo Fitzpatrick plays an apparently amateur hitman who gets in over his head. The group of teenagers who hire him to kill their evil friend are clueless of the consequences of what they are doing are, and I'm not talking about the law. He has to yell at them to stop talking about the murder out in the open in their own neighborhood. They could be talking about any other activity that a bunch of people could be excited about. A lot of people might not like a movie populated with characters so stupid about committing serious crimes, but I found it fascinating at how inept they are. As far as how exploitive the film is, especially concerning the sex, in this type of movie I think it's appropriate. Seeing all the aimless sex, drugs, and violence gets you situated in their everyday world, and is the only way to make the murder believable. Is Larry Clark a pervert or a pedophile? Well, I think most of the nudity is meant to be emotionally ugly and desperate, it's hard to imagine he filmed it for erotic purposes, although even if he did, all the actors who are naked are over 18, and in that case I have to ask, what's wrong with a lot of nudity? Are there this many grown people offended by nakedness? I myself am rather pro-nudity and in this case it only enhances the drama in Bully. **** out of ****",Bully
102,Karma-15,Can't stop thinking about this movie,9,8 August 2001,"It's raw, shocking and even erotic.When I first left the theatre, I couldn't shake the images of Bijou Phillips' magnificent body (of which we see plenty in ""Bully""). Yes, if you want to see lots of good-looking female flesh, there's enough to go around. Phillips and Rachel Miner have enough nude scenes to fill an adolescent's fantasies for a long time.Later in the day, however, other thoughts crept into my mind. It's a true story, but even if it were total fiction, it still would hit pretty hard. It's a brutal story about seven young adults who are willing to murder one of their own. The stark portrayal of the events leading up to the crime and the killing itself just won't leave me.I find myself looking for every bit of information about this hideous murder. You'll laugh when I tell you the name of the last movie that sent me looking for more background like this -- Titanic. Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum!",Bully
103,phmurphy,Larry Clark is great,8,31 December 2003,"For those of you who dont like this movie, first of all watch KIDS and second of all learn a little more about Larry Clark. He is a great director and depicts this actual true story brilliantly. I can understand why people think that the acting is bad, but i cant say this enough: THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED AND THESE KIDS WERE REALLY LIKE THAT. This movie is great and larry clark does such a good job to show you what these degenerate florida kids really did to their so called friend.

105,mgreene-2,Disturbing and Not For the Faint of Heart,7,22 March 2002,"I rented the unrated DVD version of Bully without knowing anything about the storyline or what the movie was about and sweet Jesus was I in for a disconcerting surprise. The movie starts out on a lighter note - sort of like a cross between Happiness and American Pie. Its beginning somehow resembles a dark and deviant, misogynistic teen comedy of sorts. However, by act two the story digresses and unfolds into a murder scheme and the actions of its players become more and more disturbing. The most significant problem I had with this film is that essentially spends too much time and energy exploring and focusing on the sexual lives of its characters, thus resulting in a GROSS UNDERDEVELOPMENT of the meaningful storyline. Entirely too much of the film is spent on showcasing the kids' sexual exploits and not enough time is allocated toward exhibiting family and background information that is necessary for the viewer to understand anything about the characters' actions. I wanted to know much more about the adolescents' upbringings and their relationships with their parents that would cause them to act this way in the first place. This simply was not portrayed in the film.The only social aspects of the characters the viewer learns is they like to have a lot of sex, use drugs, play video games, and they are all very shallow and naive. The positive vantage point in this, and I am not sure if it was purposely intended by the director, is that it definitely stimulates the viewer's interest in learning more about the subject matter by reading the literature the film was based upon. In conclusion, because of its lack of character development, Bully fails in its bid to be considered a great film. However, its climax is shockingly alarming, incredibly raw, and definitely nerve-racking and uncomfortable. Overall, Bully is a life-like and engrossing film, yet incomplete in its story, and should NOT be viewed by those who are easily offended or upset by bizarre, grotesque, or graphic violence, sexual imagery and/or dialogue in film.  7/10",Bully
106,Ilovehandbagsandshoes,I thought it was a brilliant film,9,3 March 2011,"I happened to catch this film late last week and when I finally had the chance to see it all the way through I thought it was kind of brilliant really.I disagree with what others have said about there being too much sex. This was one of the few films where I think I understood why there was so much.First off I want to say that I think it's another film that falls within the genre of 'the aftermath of the American Dream'. This is a world where the kids have everything; large luxurious houses, smart cars, parents that are solid and affluent etc.But they chose to live in Florida. There is something intoxicating about living in continual sunshine if you are basically of Northern European descent. What I mean is, you end up with too much of a good thing.Their environment doesn't test them - apart from school exams - which is a sanitised way for society to cream off the best and leave a heaving vat of wasted, average intelligence people to die slowly of misery and relative poverty.Sex is their ticket to thrills they can't get from the concrete jungle that has no trees for climbing; hunting; beating each other up; or climbing up rock faces to get honey etc etc. What I mean is the landscape doesn't test their strength - what tests them is how far they can go with sex and drugs.What teenagers know more than anyone else, is how much hope there is OUT THERE. And I am afraid to say, like so many kids from good homes that end up as part of the underclass, these kids have sussed that all that's left after their society has relocated jobs to the Far East or Eastern Europe, is working in Pizza Restaurants.In this environment, it would seem, murder becomes a solution to lack of motivation.",Bully

If I didn't rate a movie based on my enjoyment this would be there amongst the worst but its just so stupidly funny. I almost turned it off after 20 minutes because I was laughing my ass off how bad they acted. But it just became like a dumb meme instead. BUT, but, towards the end it gets kinda good despite the kindergarten quality of the actors. The spinning shot was the closest I've been to a high since I quit drugs and that his brother wore a no to drugs and violence tee cracked me up. I mean I enjoyed this.

109,SCUM-Auxiliary,Anarchic Justice,10,6 July 2005,"Perhaps unconsciously, Larry Clark's exploration of teenage degeneracy and de-facto nihilism does a brilliant job of depicting the nihilistic consequences of life in an absurd world bereft of value...Spoilers: This stark and appropriately gritty film presents, in a delightfully ungilded manner that keeps with the exploitation film genre, the last chapter in the lives of titular bully Bobby, his supposed ""best friend"" Marty, and the other disaffected, suburban youth that become involved in an eventually successful conspiracy to murder the aforementioned personification of all the problems with which these teens, and society in general, are grappling. The fitting focus of the characters' collective derision is a member of the upper class (as his domineering father, while firmly rooted in the same upper-middle income bracket as the rest of the community, affects a supercilious attitude toward his son's seemingly directionless, that is to say non-business-driven surfer cohort), whose future in the aristocracy can in no way be jeopardized by his brutal acts toward his peers, whom he keeps in a thrall of impotent fear akin to that in which his father holds him. While his father plans for college and a future in stereo sales (entirely disregarding any differing, autonomous desires his offspring may have about his own life), Marty, a high school drop-out and father-to-be (though the paternity of the fetus is questionable, possibly the product of Bobby, who raped Marty's girlfriend Lisa), must languish in a seemingly empty career in pizza delivery, or some other dead-end job symptomatic of suburban life. When Lisa's best friend is also raped by this reptilian sociopath content to use all people as objects of his perverted, ultimately homo-erotic lust (alluded to in less than subtle terms), a posse of random strip-mall archetypes are assembled to help Marty and Lisa rise up and exact vengeance for which they would pay with their already wasted lives. These accomplices include an obese, video-game obsessed virgin afflicted seemingly with arrested development, an aspiring Mafioso poseur, the drug-addled, kinky pretty-boy lover of Alli (the hardened best friend of Lisa and one of Bobby's literal rape victims), and the latter's waif-like friend who embarks on this mission right out of rehab. Each of these well-played characters contributes something, either helpful or otherwise, to the caper, and lends the potentially simple murder a revolutionary quality, as these oppressed, abandoned punks take back their formerly unused agency and end the life of he who ruined theirs (if not he himself, his class and kind)...The communal, cooperative event of the murder claims one of the more deserving (if anyone can be said to ""deserve"" death (whatever ""deserve"" means)) characters in recent cinema history, in spite of his obvious humanity and occasional poignancy, though the law only serves to punish further these scarred children who were just doing what the video games, gangsta rap and class-war violence in general had conditioned and divided them to do. However, their underlying nihilism (which created the lack of unity that resulted in their apprehension (and got them apprehended)) turned what could have been a beauteous act of empowering activism into yet another f**k-up in a life full of them...",Bully
110,sechriwa,Soul decay,7,5 March 2003,"Bully is a mere description of suburban American teenagers without a soul and without a mind. Sometimes it's just unbearable to watch, the camera work sometimes is confusing and some dialogues are dull. But maybe Clark intended to do it this way. But, maybe it's Clark's most realistic movie. Whereas the characters in 'Kids' actually were human beings, worrying about themselves, the characters in 'Bully' don't have the ability to think for themselves or to feel human emotions. They are on drugs, not only alcohol, sex and weed, but they're also addicted - or heavily tied to - American suburban life: malls, middle class cars, stupid jobs. They don't have any ability to think BEYOND that lifestyle, and neither does the film. Some scenes with their parents are extremely strong. It's a sad film because I didn't think that the decay of American teenagers has advanced so rapidly. Not all of them of course, but the lifestyle portrayed in 'Bully' actually IS typically US-American.",Bully
111,EddieMink,"A masterpiece, plain and simple",10,5 September 2002,"Having followed Larry Clark's work in photography with great admiration for many years, when he finally unleashed ""Kids"" on the world, I couldn't have been more disappointed. Clark did his job just fine, but the script was so meandering and desperate to shock that the film itself lacked any kind of narrative focus, and did inevitably seem almost entirely dedicated to being shocking, and nothing more. What though, I asked myself, could Clark achieve with a focused script, a bigger budget and some more accomplished actors? ""Bully"" is the exhilarating answer. Although shot in the similarly gritty style of his debut - Bully has so much more going for it in every conceivable department. All of the actors involved give truly phenomenal, frightening performances. The script is dark, honest and thematically uncompromising. Clark's visual sense has sharpened ten fold, revealing a film maker with an astonishingly accomplished grasp of both linear narrative storytelling, and cohesive, relevant stylistics. The best examples of both occur in the film's finale, when (for the first time in the film) Clark resorts to using incongruous pop music on the soundtrack. As the film slowly slips away, and the music eases us into the relaxed reality that we were, ""only watching a movie"", the film's final image throws up a shattering caption which hits home like a fist in the throat. Its tough. Its utterly uncompromising. Its one of the finest films I've seen in the last ten years. I urge everyone with an open mind to go and seek it out.",Bully
112,Jaspa1982,What's the point?,3,15 January 2019,"A film of this subject matter isn't one to enjoy but one to experience. Unfortunately the experience of Bully is unsatisfying. A simplistic take on the true events surrounding the murder of a young man that we really don't get to know at all. Except to say that he's mean. In a sensational case like this, the media will find a hook to sell the story, in this case ""Kid killed by friends because he was a bully."" A film should be exploring the subject in far more detail than a newspaper story but we
don't get any real idea of why these kids did what they did. (I haven't read the book so can't comment on whether it does a better job). The characters motivations are not consistent and are just surface, no real human depth. Trying to explain in one-dimensional terms why someone commits a terrible crime shouldn't be the basis for a narrative, unless the message is ""we just don't know"". And if that's the message then the film should honour that and not try to offer ideas on motivation. A film like Elephant should be the model, where it says ""this is what happened"" in a powerful, intelligent (and artistic) way. But with its pretense to demonstrating motive Bully is pop psychology and exploitative to boot.Simply presenting the facts of these kids lives and suggesting that a reason for what happened lies within is the film's mistake. It's far more complicated than a few cliché teenage scenes from a thousand movies. For example, lots of teenagers struggle with their sexuality but it doesn't turn them into killers. If the writer and director and actors can't bring us any real insight into why this happened, they shouldn't try. There's no point to a narrative film tackling a subject like this in this manner. A documentary would do a much better job.The real trouble with a film like this is that it tries to say something about society, suggesting it's a mirror to the life and feelings of America's youth and their bleak existence but really it's just a dim light illuminating a tiny minority of that youth who need to be represented in the media and in film much better than this.",Bully
113,Hurr78,A film that misses its mark,6,28 July 2001,"Bully is an interesting attempt to create a film that says something about how teenagers think and act when left to their own devices, but it almost completely falls flat. Although some of the acting is good, especially on the part of Nick Stahl, the actors aren't given too much to work with. The script is a major problem. What (I assume) is supposed to be a provocative script just caused far too many laughs from the audience that I saw the film with. The characterizations just weren't developed enough to make any of their actions truly believable. Hence, the unintended chuckles. Not a complete waste of time, but a film that could have and should have been much better. I give it a 6 out of 10.",Bully
114,Deran_Ludd,America like it is,10,21 March 2004,"A beautiful, powerful peek into the real lives of the kids around us. Complaints about this movie being different from the book have to do with the nature of adapting fiction to film. Larry Clark has a sensibility and eye for bringing out the less than sweet side of American youth. To me ""Bully"" was like another chapter in the same study he began with ""Kids"". The acting is painfully realistic, and the manner and attitude of the youths in this film clicks so real it hurts. I am always amazed at how Clark can get young people to open up so much on camera when most of them won't even talk to their parents. Some of Clark's other cinematic efforts don't work so well, I really think he should take on the task of bringing to the screen the lives of kids in latter day US of A.",Bully

118,solarisdeschain,"Too crude to be great, but it has its moments... (possible spoilers)",8,30 January 2005,"2001's Bully from director Larry Clark (Kids, Another Day in Paradise) is indeed a good movie. I won't tell you the plot details here, since you can check the plot higher up on the page.Bully has wonderful screen writing for the most part, nice direction, and the acting was all good, too. Nothing great, just good.The film is indeed based on a book, which is an account of a true story, and is very compelling.Now we get to the cons, almost every other scene features sex between Bijou Philips or Rachel Miner, or at least one of them nude, now this doesn't really irk me all, and the two of them (Bijou Phillips much more, though) are quite nice to look at. But after a point you think, ""wow, this is just gratuitous. How is this important to anything in any way?"" I also found it hard to sympathize with several of the ""terrorized kids"" but I don't think this is a bad thing. These kids were, for all intents and purposes, useless (I'm not talking about Nick Stahl) except maybe for Marty Pucchio, who coulduh been a contenduh...at surfing.Now, though, for Nick Stahl. This is the character I felt most sympathetic about, because sure, he may have been a bit of a bully, but it seemed to be because he couldn't get in touch with his feelings. He was afraid and yet at the same time intrigued by his sexual confusion which several teenagers go through. I know kids like this (except maybe about the homosexual feelings, because thats only my business if they tell me) and this poor kid needed counseling. However, this, for me made the pivotal scene, the climax, that more powerful. What was left after the climax though, still carried that power, because of the final song in the movie. It worked great.Final word, Too much sex, too much nudity, and a little too much language keep this film from becoming truly great.",Bully
119,nzbungy,"Okay, it's time to write a review...",5,16 July 2003,"Now that I have finished the movie and read through the assorted materials and links on IMDB, I am ready to write my own review.  It will be split into two sections, the first a look at the artistic content, the second my personal feelings.  If you don't wish to read someone else's opinions, please skip part two.  Spoilers may follow.To start with, this film is indubitably very interesting.  Several teenagers gang up on the neighborhood bully and decide to finish him off.  Clark successful directed it, all except for the one scene in which he puts the camera in the middle of their group, and decides to turn it around and around.  It's unfortunate most of the actors/actresses were rather new to the game.  Their performances suffice for the most part, but at times their amateurism seeps through.  I don't think I can really complain about the script, as it is based on a true story, so I will leave that for part two. It seems as if Clark were trying to make a point through shocking his audience, just as Aronofsky did in ""Requiem for a Dream"", but the comparison would be a crime to make, as ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a masterpiece, and ""Bully"" seems as if it wants to make a point, but can't quite decide what it is or how to make it.  As a final note, the fact that it was filmed in 23 days is quite astonishing.  Please skip the following section if you are likely to be offended. 
Now, did I like this movie?  No.  I hated it.  I abhorred it, I detested it. I did not like a single one of the kids, except for the hit man, but I didn't really like his acting.  I felt a bit of sympathy for Marty, and extreme hatred for Bobby, especially with his sexual violence toward women, and also toward Marty.  I didn't like Lisa's acting, and didn't really care for her character either.  Also, I couldn't stand Donnie, and although Heather was hot, I didn't much like her either.  The reason for this is probably because they are just empty shells of people, having had their brains eaten out by their constant use of drugs.  Such emptiness and hollowness really bothered me.  Another aspect I didn't like was the way it bothered me.  Not quite disturbed me, just really bothered me.  ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"" disturbed me, but in a good way in that it made me ponder the questions set before me.  This movie seemed to just show these dead people walking around and smoking and dropping acid and getting in on with whomever whenever and wherever for no real reason.  By the way, it definitely would have been rated NC-17, thanks in no small part to the sexual violence and constant nudity.  I also didn't like the script.  It seemed to focus for a bit on the kids and their depravity, then for a bit on the bully, then for a bit on their murderous actions, then for a brief moment on the consequences.  It never really seemed to focus closely on one aspect.  To conclude part two of this review, this movie bothered me greatly, and I despised it.To finish this review, I will attempt to give the movie my rating of it. Based mostly upon the artistic talent presented, but without ignoring my personal feelings towards it, I give it a 7 out of 10, or, to be more exact, a 6.7 out of 10.P.S. Does anyone in Florida wear clothes?",Bully
120,the_ashwee,"Drastically Extreme, Better than some.",6,17 December 2006,"I was enthusiastic about watching ""Bully"" not just because of the IMDb rating of 7.0 but also because I like films that deal with growing up and teenage trauma. This film is a roller-coaster ride of emotion and leaves you feeling sick at the end of it - not sick because of the graphic nature of the movie but because of the abrupt ending and the hollow view it has towards teenage thoughts and actions.The film starts very strong with very violent and sexual imagery which at times (particularily as I was watching with my girlfriend) is hard to watch because it is real and arguably (at times) unnecessary.The relationships in the film are superbly written and the characters are brilliantly portrayed by the actors. However as the film progresses the storyline begins to fade and the film does seem to drag on a bit.The scene near the end when they finally kill the ""bully"" was very well done as it was raw and shocking and even the build up to it did not water-down the shock value of the murder.Worth the watch if you can bear the brutality of it however I wouldn't give it anymore than a six due to its blatantness and how far fetched it all seems at times.Ash out.",Bully
121,wroache,A Very Dark Movie,10,31 July 2001,"Larry Clark's newest film, ""Bully"" is a non-stop ride of explicit sex, violence, and drugs, in much the same spirit, as his hit film ""Kids"". Unlike ""Kids"", ""Bully"" is based on a true story that occurred in Hollywood (a suburb of Ft Lauderdale), Florida in July 1993.Mr. Clark based this movie heavily on the book, ""Bully"" by Jim Schutze. VERY heavily.  In fact, up until after the murder, the movie pretty much reads line for line out of the book.  After, the murder Mr. Clark takes a little creative licensing on events.  For example, Marty Puccio's house was not raided by the police in real life. He turned himself in.  It was Derek Kaufman 'The Hitman' whose house was raided.  But these are small quibbles. Also, Mr. Clark didn't cover any of the trials or much of the post-murder police investigation.  But, again, these are minor in terms of the story he is portraying.Two bigger changes that Mr. Clark made was Bobby and Marty's supposed steroid use and Lisa's weight problem.  In the book, Marty and Bobby are portrayed as muscle bound steroid users, with steroid aggression, beating up on anybody that got in their way.  Whether they actually used steroids or not, Marty and Bobby were very well built in real life.  Compare a photo of the real Bobby Kent to one of actor Nick Stahl and you'll see what I mean. The reason, I bring this up, is the book makes it easier to see why people were intimidated and fearful of Bobby Kent.  It is kind of hard seeing Mr. Stahl as this ruthless bully.In the book, Mr. Schutze makes a big point of Lisa Connelly's weight problem.  In the movie Lisa (played by Rachel Miner) is very thin and in good shape.  The weight problem, which caused her to have problems with getting boyfriends in the book, makes her determination of staying with Marty despite abuse and rape, more understandable.A casual viewer might not understand why these kinds of points are relevant but they are since the book explored the dynamics of these dysfunctional personalities, whereas, the movie just displays them with no background or foundation.  In other words, the book better explored the backgrounds and personalities of the characters than the movie did.Overall, I like the movie for its entertainment value and enjoyed watching it despite its very dark nature.  I think the young actors (especially Brad Renfro) were great.  I think the camera work was excellent.  And the music was outstanding.BUT, with that being said.  Do not take anything in this movie as 100% factual.  There are a great many people who do not believe the book ""Bully"" to be completely accurate.  I personally believe the book to be very fictionialized and completely disliked how Mr. Schutze approached the subject.  For example, Mr. Schutze gives no references for any of the 'facts' in his book.  One is left to guess if they came from court documents, police reports, the convicted killers, or his own imagination. Some events he described were detailed to the point of unbelieveability. Even his narrative is flawed and inconsistencies can be noticed from one page to another.  There are many other flaws in it but this is not the forum to be listing them.  I am just pointing this out since the movie was based off the book and therefore might not be completely accurate to what really happened.Before you see this movie, beware that it is unrated.  If it had been rated I couldn't imagine any rating below an NC-17.  I actually saw a few older people walk out of the theater during the explicit sex scenes.  There is also gay sex, rape, drug use, and heavy violence.  So if you do not like that kind of material I would not recommend you see this movie.If you do go and see it stay thru the whole credits.  Mr. Clark listed the killers original sentences just before the credits started but a few of them (Marty, Lisa, and Ali's) were significantly reduced on appeal and two (Derek Dzvirko and Heather) have been released after serving a few years each in prison.  Mr. Clark lists this info AFTER the credits roll.",Bully

The cinematography is very Floridian and is captured nicely. The acting is very good, Bijue Phillips surprised me, and Nick Stahl really delivered as a messed up kid confused (?)about his sexuality which is something that neither the film or the book explored.

Different in a good way.It's the story of a group of naive, drug-addicted Florida teens who group up and plot the murder of their mutual friend who has been terrorizing them for years. It should be clarified that the story is based off of the killer's account as Bobby Kent is now deceased.Compared to Kids, this is more of a conventional film with less of a documentary/skate video feel to it.

Calrk directs with a total sense of perversity as these aimless adolescents screw, drink, murder, and rape with raw abandon. Marty (Brad Renfro) is a high school drop out who has long been dominated by his sadistic friend Bobby. There is a disturbing undercurrent of homosexuality to their strange friendship (Bobby forces Marty to work on a gay phone sex line and rapes his girlfriend for kicks). Its not long before Marty and His new girlfreind begin to hatch a plot to murder this wannabe Marquis De Sade.

Most films deal with murder in such a dismissive way, but BULLY builds it up and shows how difficult and clumsy the act can be.Sex is a very strong theme throughout the movie, here it is where a lot of the criticism is aimed at. A sex act is performed every few minutes it seems and it is very honest not glamouress to me. This is a film about teenagers; sex, drugs, violence is exposed to many at this stage in life and is unashamed to show it.I admire a film which also deals with the consequences of crime, the panic and guilt dominating after the act.

131,4dtvman,Hooray for Larry Clark !!!!,10,23 August 2002,"I saw the unrated version of ""Bully"" on one of the premium movie channels the other night and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This is definitely the best movie from 2001 that I have seen on pay cable this year. It gets the top rating from me.I'm so glad there are a least a few directors like Larry Clark still around. He doesn't care if he offends a lot of people and that's the attitude that more directors SHOULD have. He makes movies like they were made in the heyday of movie-making (1976-1985), when movie makers took chances and were concerned more about art than money. One of the reasons I don't like most of today's movies is because most mainstream directors try to go for the broadest audience possible and are such slaves to political correctness and that gosh-awful PG-13 rating (which, by the way, is ruining American cinema).I'll be politically incorrect myself my saying I really enjoyed all the nudity in ""Bully"" and I don't think it was excessive or gratuitous. It's refreshing to see nudity actually done by actresses playing leading roles in mainstream movies instead of by body doubles or silicone-infested porn actresses. This movie is a very raw and realistic look at teenage life in the early 21st century. There's nothing sugar-coated about it, which means this movie is not for everyone. As I alluded to earlier, they just don't make enough movies that anymore. I will also say that I was pleasantly surprised by Rachel Miner's performance.

Lisa can onlytake so much watching her new boyfriend get beat on by his socalled best friend and Bobby even rapes her himself, so shedecides to gather together some friends to kill Bobby.
This film, inspired by a true story, is really a performance pieceand all the young leads pull it off superbly. All of them addinganother string to their bow. Rachel Miner (Lisa) proves there's a lotmore to her than just being Macurly Culkin's wife (now divorced).Nick Stahl makes a wonderful bully' portraying Bobby Kent(Around this time IN THE BEDROOM was also released in whichhe plays a drastically different character proving him to be a veryversatile actor). Brad Renfro (Marty) shows a more sensitive sideas the `bullied' and demands sympathy playing this repressedcharacter. Bijou Phillips (Ali) is phenomenal as the slutty friend ofLisa. Michael Pitt (Donny) is hilarious as Ali's junky boyfriend. AndLarry Clark proves once more what a brilliant `visually real' directorhe is.The film is shocking, real and spookily entertaining.

134,stebmarc,"Frighting and believable, must see for parents",9,30 April 2005,"This is a interesting and frightening film, worth a viewing by every parent of teenage children. Whether they know it or not, their children at least know children like these; they are living in a world that includes this reality. Some of the best insights are in the portrayals of the parents.Every one of them believes that their child has fallen in with the wrong crowd, and they are all right. What they don't seem to be able to conceive of is that their child IS part of the wrong crowd and why it is wrong. None if then could be described as a good kid being lead astray, but all of them, except the psychologically monstrous Bobby, do have some appealing, or at least pathetic qualities, and might have been saved by adult intervention. But there is none and they are lost from the beginning. These parents can't see their children, don't know their children, seem to be afraid of them, afraid of confronting them either because they fear losing them or pushing them into even more destructive behavior. They seem to care, but not enough to risk embarking on a messy intervention. They only want to relate to them as the accessible children they used to be.So the children (even though are 16-22, they are emotionally 8-10) are so addled by drugs and alcohol and sex that have no concept of the reality and consequences of actions. They do seem to have a good grasp of the one fact that their lives are essentially hopeless, what they are doing is unsustainable and can not lead to anything but self-destruction. They know it, but it is no more real to them than a video game. Nothing is real; you just hit the replay button and do it over. And there seems to be no one in their world, but other teenagers just like themselves. This includes the ""hit man"" they have mistaken for an adult, more competent than themselves, able to lead them in safely freeing themselves from the sociopath who main interest in life is controlling them, torturing them, convincing them they are worthless and helpless. It is gut wrenching to watch them deteriorate, individually and as a group, in the face of the actual murder and its aftermath.Watching them is like watching school children hijack their own school bus and accelerate toward a brick wall: watching the crash in slow motion, fascinated and helpless, seeing the expressions on their faces change, seeing them looking at one another, saying ""it wasn't my idea, I didn't do it, I didn't mean it"" as the gap closes. The conclusion, the prison sentences, is devastating.",Bully
135,alexo-5,"A disturbingly frank look at teenage amorality in Suburbia, USA",8,4 August 2001,"Although a bit exploitative, ""Bully"" - based on real events that took place in 1993 - is an intriguing look at a set of ""normal"" suburban teenagers for whom life has developed no real meaning.Marty (Brad Renfro) and Bobby (Nick Stahl) are childhood best friends living in Hollywood, Florida--a sun-drenched Miami suburb. When they aren't working in a fast-food sandwich shop, they spend their time surfing, driving around and picking up girls. Bobby, the smarter of the pair (which isn't saying much), sees Marty as his physical, mental and social punching bag, abusing him in front of their friends or attractive girls. Bobby is shown to be equally abusive to everyone in their small circle of friends, culminating in an extremely unpleasant rape scene as Bobby forces his victim to ""Say I'm the best you've ever had!"" while he grabs her by her hair.When Marty begins dating the equally aimless Lisa (Rachel Miner), she begins to fantasize with him about what their lives would be like if Bobby no longer existed, how it would really be best for everyone. She suggests they murder him, and they casually mention their plans to the other members of their social circle. Not wanting to seem prudish, their friends smile and say things like, ""Wow, are you serious?"" and ""Cool..."" and they begin planning their attack.These aimless, dim-witted teenagers finally find a common sense of purpose as they plot to kill the monstrous Bobby. They set up meetings at Pizza Hut and plan the murder as if they were a 4-H club arranging a surprise birthday party for one of their fellow members. These meetings are led by the unbalanced Lisa, whose new-found determination gradually transforms her from a disheveled mouse of a girl into a trashy/glamorous femme-fatale. Miner's captivating, surprising performance is full of nuance and rage, recalling a young Piper Laurie. The young actors all do a remarkable job of realizing these characters that are troubled and sympathetic even as they willfully head toward becoming monsters themselves. They all want so much to fit in that none has the courage to speak up and say, ""Wait a minute...what the HELL do we think we're doing?"" Even Bobby is shown to be a product of a domineering father, repressed homosexual desires and self-loathing. Unfortunately, after being convincingly depicted as a horribly confused teen, he disappears from the film only to resurface when his friends' plan is set into motion. Here, any further character-development is abandoned as he occasionally grabs someone's crotch or tells them to give him a blow-job, indicating that no, he has not had a change of heart and yes, he still deserves to die.The acting by the adults in the film is less convincing, even wooden. This doesn't hurt the film, really, and may have even been intentional. It creates a sense that the parents are completely out of touch with the lives their children are leading. They are awkward when addressing their kids, don't relate to them emotionally and can only offer advice like, ""Ok...you kids have fun now and stay out of trouble.""Aside from one obtrusive, dizzying camera swirl and some close-up crotch shots that seem randomly inserted into the film, ""Bully"" is a disturbing, thought-provoking look at how some basically good kids are drawn into committing a gruesome, unimaginable act for which none of them are emotionally or psychologically equipped.",Bully
136,luckyhb13,"Boring, boring, ...",1,10 August 2006,"Lots of teeny/twenty something viewers will wax indignant if one can't see this as a brilliant piece of art. However, if Larry Clark is a genius then why does he deal with the blindingly obvious? Virtually every kid I know has behaved like this; I behaved like this when I was a kid - jeez I'll bet even some of our parents did. Okay - apart from the murder part. It does misuse the 'based on a true story' to portray events - from what I have read it is very, very loosely based on a true story. Anyone who has watched other people taking drugs knows how boring it is, and the sex is only there for titillation. Most of the nude scenes have little to do with the plot and yes - they do seem to point at the fact that the director is a pervert. There simply is no need for us to see Bijou Phiip's crotch in 'that scene' - it has been clearly established at that point that the character is a tad slutty.Well those who love it have little understanding of art and those who rail against it are reacting in a way that gives Clark the publicity that he wants. If you want to watch a pointless masturbation epic rent it. If you're a little more grown up I'd give it a miss.",Bully
137,quinsledge,Annoying characters,3,9 January 2021,"This movie has to be number one for world's most annoying characters. From the way they laugh to they way they constantly look sweaty is honestly irritating. One on girl talks and hardly opens her mouth and all her lines are stupid. The one scene where they talk about setting up the murder and the kid is talking and ranting while letting spit drool out of his mouth is irritating. Also the scene where the one kid who joins the group later on is playing with his dog and let's the dog slober all over his mouth was totally gross. The parents are total idiots. The movie is more irritating than anything else. It seems like it could have been a good story but all the annoying factors just add up and make it hard to watch. Also the ""bullies"" dad is totally oblivious to the fact that his son is strange and potentially a psychopath.",Bully
138,VanityKills,Wow....,10,12 June 2005,"I saw this movie tonight and could not look away. I mean, I felt kind of like a pervert for watching 'teenagers' get naked and all that..... but after a while you are numbed out to the sex and nudity, just as I presume these kids were. Not to mention the drugs..... these kids had heavily messed up lives.Thumbs up to Bijou Phillips...excellent job.....When I found out that this was a true story and there were elements even beyond what I had surmised in the film, I was both bowled over and sad. What a terrible fate for a bunch of suburban kids with every opportunity to get it straight.The only reason the 'bully' was on the straight and narrow is because it seemed like his strict father (who spends far too much time in the bathroom with the 'bully' character while he was naked for my comfort...what the heck was that??)would kick his butt into next week if he didn't.....& look what that turned him into...... A sociopath, homosexual hating, abusive rapist....for goodness sake let loose of the reins a little dad and let the kid figure out what all these feelings of rage are about..... I wish this kid had been able to figure out his sexuality & get some help .....He needed to deal with himself rather than take it out on others & then die at the hands of Marty and the friends of those he tormented.....The portrayals of the kids in this culture were so achingly real that I wanted to switch the TV off and go to bed, but was drawn into this real life hell that they lived in.I mean, the girls that keep going back for more. Sex and rape are exchanged like currency. It just seems like, 'oh well.... you have a boyfriend and his icky friend wants to get with you.... then you better let him'. I mean, you think that problems like that are not going on, but they are. Now I know where all the 'That's My Baby's Daddy' Jerry Springer guests come from....:(.... I feel sorry for the confused, angry, bitter and sad Marty.... humiliated, beaten, raped for years.... acting out against his girlfriend & on his own life by becoming a 'less than'.....was any of that was taken into any account by the jury? ...... I guess I can relate because I am not sure that as a teen that the same kind of idiotic plot would go through my mind if the abusiveness of a peer was that severe.I have to say, this is a must see...it shines for & beyond it's sad plot...like 'Boys Don't Cry', 'Heavenly Creatures' or 'Monster' ....it is a movie I was deeply touched and I hurt inside for those in real life who suffered (whether their cause was right or wrong, they suffered).... but one I will never watch again..nor do I need to..I will not forget.",Bully

Kids was a fine example of this, but ""Bully"" makes Kids look like a John Hughs movie.This movie was not about entertainment or charactor development.  In fact you are not supposed to care about these charactors.  Instead, you are forced to wonder how a group of 6 kids could be so casual about setting up someone in their circle to be murdered.  Although these kids had a lack of any sort of direction to begin with, after the murder occurs, none of them feel that they were personally responsible.  Having had the opportunity to view one of Larry Clark's photo exhibits at the Toledo Museum of Art (Toledo, OH) I was given a great insight to Clark's view on the darker side of adolescence.  In his ""Tulsa"" exhibit, Clark photographed his friends in their most candid states:  Injecting Methamphetamine, casual nudity and sex, firearms, all this sometimes in the presence of infants or young children. Clarks subject matter, the way he portrays it and his style in cinematography all reflects his background as a photographer, and a former 'meth' user.  Like it or not, it is very honest.  Rather than assuming his nudity and use of casual sex is gratuatis, it is very much grounded in reality, as his photographs have shown.  His honest and no-holds-barred approach is very refreshing in this day and age of film catering to the largest audience possible. Both Bully and Kids are important works because it is ground that few, if any, filmmakers are willing to touch.

142,MwmZX2,Sick...but I Couldn't Stop Watching...,10,24 January 2002,"Bully is a very hard movie to watch. Disturbing in every sense of the word, Bully follows the lives of a group of wasted teenagers who plot to have one of their tormenting friends brutally murdered. As I said before, the movie is sick and twisted, but addicting. All of the characters turn in superb performances, especially Rachel Miner and Bijou Phillips. Nick Stahl equally has a powerful screen presense in this movie. The music is great, the directing borderline beautiful, and the conclusion a masterpiece. I don't think I have ever been so deeply affected by a movie's ending than I was after I saw Bully.  Though not for the squeamish, Bully is a great film. The fact that this movie is based on a true story is beyond my belief. How could these kids do something so heinous and morbid? How could Nick Stahl be so cruel? It is hard to pick sides on who is right and wrong in this movie, because there is no right. See it for yourself. I promise you that this will be one of those movies that stays with you long after the credits have rolled...",Bully
143,genieinabottle,fantastic,10,19 August 2007,"'Bully' is an impressive movie, there's no doubts about it. First of all, even though the young actors aren't very well-known, the acting is superb, very realistic and convincing. I don't think more well-known actors could make a better job of it. Also, the attractive looks of the actresses definitely contribute to the appeal of this film. Their characters are well developed, which makes it even more realistic. However, I must say that the movie was shot from a men's point of view, which especially shows in some of the close-ups of the female characters. The girls were very easy and didn't have to be asked for sex because they offered it of their own accord. Also the dialog was so realistic and believable. I couldn't help marveling at the way they talked and behaved, it seemed so real. It made me scared, made me laugh, and made me emotional. I was watching it with complete awe. One frightening thing about the depicted events was the relationships the kids had with their parents. The parents actually had no idea what their own children were up to. They fell so easily for what they told them and didn't try to take a deeper interest in their lives. And that again is so true to life, because it is often the case that parents don't really know their own children, they trust them too much and fall for their lies. All in all, an amazing flick that will blow you away.",Bully

What is going to follow from the making of this film?",Bully
147,Imbluecollar25,Reminds me of where I come from,8,25 April 2009,"To me this movie reminds me of the area and people I grew up with right outside Detroit. Growing up in a semi safe suburban neighborhood with the lower and middle class houses on one side, and the section 8 apartments on the other. A lot of the kids in this movie I could say I knew people like that in my life. Some on drugs, some with serious problems, some with no direction. I'm 23 now but every day I see suburban kids getting worse and more careless. I thought it was bad when I was 13 but now 10 years later its anything from better. It's like I live in a white Detroit.I think the root problem with the kids in this movie movie is the so popular out of control lifestyle that young people like to associate with. In my neighborhood the problem is the drugs and crime that comes out of our section 8 apartments. All of that spilled onto our neighborhood and turned the middle class white kids into drugged out thugs. I chose to disassociate with kids that tried to turn me into one of them. I at least grew up knowing right from wrong and not to get myself into a mess, even if that meant getting rid of my old friends.It's not just my area, its the whole metro Detroit area that has become like the city that sits right next to us.I feel Marty grew up in a good home, however his father figure may or may not have taught him how to defend himself. It's also hard to let go of your only friends, even though they might treat you bad. I noticed Marty say in the movie Bobby had a major influence using peer pressure against him.Kids now a days don't have the respect my family's generation was brought up with. I'm no Psychiatrist, but my guess would be this generation has had it easier when it comes to discipline and respect. It could be the previous generation had things too hard and took it easy on their kids. Not to mention it was a different time with lower crime levels. Kids have a fascination with urban society now a days and think its cool. Not to mention the drugs and violence that come with it.The media also plays a huge part on how kids are with music and T.V. I grew up with Ninja Turtles, and Power Rangers. I didn't start listening to rap music until I was about 13 but I never tried to become the people that made the music because I knew that life wouldn't of helped me in any way. I knew I didn't come from that type of home and I didn't like trouble so I listened to it but I never let it influence me because I thought it was cool.So all in all I think bad discipline, white kids fascination with hip hop, and the media were the problems in this movie.My explanations, 1. Bobby probably wasn't disciplined.2. Almost all the characters in the movie talked ghetto or listened to rap music, and in turn came the drugs drugs.3. Yes, the media is partly to blame because they advertise and sell violent things everyday.",Bully
148,REG927,This Movie was REPULSIVE and STUPID,1,29 April 2008,"I dvr'ed this movie the other day, and couldn't wait to watch it, as I had read the book a few years ago and was entrhalled by the story. I don't recall the book being all about gay sex and parents so ignorant that they aren't even believable on the screen.If I can say anything about this movie, it's a drug infested, soft-core porno and if I wanted to watch a bunch of teenagers having sex with anyone and everyone I would have rented something like that. I really thought the movie would go into the feelings of the characters and why they felt that this boy needed to die. I guess they really were just some stupid, spoiled kids though, as the movie showed none of that. I have a hard time believing any of the story. I cannot believe that parents are truly that ignorant, and if they are, then shame on them. These kids are rotten, spoiled, drug addicted brats, and I was a teenager once too, and not that long ago, and I never seen or acted as stupidly as these kids did, maybe because we had parents who cared about us, and we cared about ourselves. I got into my share of trouble, but this movie is just a glorification of ignorance and self abuse. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it, that's how unbelievable the story and characters are. I wonder if the real life kids were really this ignorant and stupid. If so, then I guess they are right where they belong, behind bars.",Bully
149,CarrieSpicoli,You Can Only Push Someone So Far Until They Crack,9,18 July 2006,"Like another user commented before, Bully is Strangely a masterpiece. Centered around a good kid gone bad Marty (Brad Renfro)and Bobby (Nick Stahl), Marty's so called ""Best- Friend"", Bobby is a very mean, sociopathic person, as he cracks as soon as things don't go how he planned. Marty is basically his lapdog, he makes Marty dance with him at a gay bar, almost immediately ruins his chances with the very promiscuous and aimless Ali (Bijous Phillips) by making her watch gay porn while they have sex and when she doesn't want to he rapes her, and finally while on a more legal level, is just an all around asshole with no motive to Marty's girlfriend, Lisa (Rachel Miner) The plot kicks off after a great amount of backstory and alredy a history of terrorizing all of the characters, Lisa says to Marty that he should stand up for himself, which leads Marty to tearfully admit that Bobby's brutalized him all his life, so Lisa says they should kill him. This is where I start to believe Lisa's character is about as psychotic as Bobby. Marty, though he already appears to be throwing his life away is one of the only characters you can feel for, and he knows this plan is more than likely flawed, but after countless attempts at getting his parents to move he wants Bobby out of his life any way possible (going to the police would have been an option, but they probably wouldn't have believed him. I wish they would have at least addressed this in the movie)Enlisted on the killing are a couple more brain dead teens, Donnie, a druggie who sometimes seems to be placed for comic relief, played to perfection by Micheal Pitt, Mike steals every scene he's in especially the ""It's not like he's gonna swim"" or ""Okay I stabbed him but only like this much"" and so on, and his girlfriend, Heather, a rehab escapee, and came from a screwed up family. After there first attempt at killing Bobby fails, as Lisa get's cold feet, Donnie insists they get ""professional help"" as they hire a ""hitman"" (Derek I, played by ""Kids"" Leo Fitzpatrick) who's partners in crime are a bunch of 12 year- olds, and Lisa's fat cousin Derek II (Daniel Franzese), they get some more weapons, such as bats, knives, and aa baton. They decide they're ready again, and as they break into 2 groups they drive down to a swamp and they do kill Bobby, in a VERY brutal manner, kudos's to Brad Renfro, Nick Stahl, Micheal Pitt, and Kelli Garner especially. It becomes clear they are all in over their heads and even what they thought was thoroughly planned was still no where near solid, and soon enough Derek II decides he can't take it and turns everyone in. And in in a very touching -toward the end- scene, where Marty is arrested, and his brother, who Marty told to be good a few scenes before this, stares sadly as his brother is halled off to jail. In the last scene, the 7 reunite in court and they begin the court case begins, and we find out that Heather got 7 years, fat guy got 11 years, Ali got 40 Years, Lisa got life, Hit-man got life, Donnie got life, and poor Marty got the death chair. Though that was their sentence in reality all the girls are out now, and Marty ended up living but he is in for lifeFinally there is the major likes and dislikes of the filmLikes, the acting choices they chose for this film, everyone is perfect at their part, the hilarious one liners but Donnie and Heather, and the point that you can only push somebody so far until they crack. The writing is intense and the first time you see it you will be left thinking for hours, and want to learn more. A very naive group of teens these kids were, but a very interesting, multiple sides-to story they have created.Dislikes- WAY too much sex, I'm not a prude but some of the scenes were pointless and not that hot, like anytime Marty and Lisa had sex. Lisa has boobs like a man. They seemed to just be adding time on to the movie.Still, Larry Clarke is a great director, and I love his sad but true, gritty filmstyle.R.I.P Brad Renfro.",Bully
150,lchris9,One-Dimensional,5,10 February 2002,"The characters in Bully are right out of Larry Clarke's earlier film, Kids. They all walk around with blank stares, spend the whole day smoking dope, having casual sex and playing video games. The cast of Bully is all very good at playing these one-dimensional characters, but this only goes so far. I found it impossible to get emotionally involved in the story, as there is no one who is even remotely sympathetic. The ""bully"" of the movie's title is a sadistic creep who pretty much deserves what he gets; the perpetrators are idiotic almost beyond belief. The parents of the teenagers are stereotypical movie parents, utterly clueless to what their offspring are up to. We may be living in a time of cultural decline, but Bully manages to exaggerate this to the point of absurdity. It's unintentionally (I assume) funny at times, which detracts from the shock value that Clarke seems to be striving for. The camera is constantly seeking the most unflattering poses; these teens seem to walk around dead-eyed with mouths half open all the time. The characters are barely able to speak in complete sentences. Bully is apparently based on a true story. It's a safe assumption that the teenagers who committed the actual crime were not exactly high functioning members of society. However, it's a kind of cop-out to suggest, as Bully does, that they are all drooling morons. It almost takes away any sense that they could be held responsible for their actions. Bully is like watching a live version of Beavis and Butthead, or maybe Southpark. The problem is, it seems intended as serious social commentary.",Bully

There is nothing unique about Larry Clark.  All he is is a pedophile who enjoys seeing teenagers strip naked and rut like cockroaches in a tin can.  Truly sickening movie.  There was no character development in this story at all (despite the fact it is apparently true).  The motivations of these kids did not convince me nearly enough.  It seemed to be a completely random decision that they made and, with the horrible script, seemingly unjustifiable.  Larry Clark needs to seek some severe mental counseling and stop trying to make a reputation for himself as the town kiddie-rapist.

154,gtrz,Horrifying account of misguided teens,5,26 August 2011,"I must say that this is one of the more brutal films I have ever seen. To say this movie is hard-edged is an understatement. Only the most hardened among us would not find at least parts of this movie difficult to watch. One aspect that I found to be truly disturbing was the degree of callousness and conscienceless ease in which this group of south Florida teenagers plotted the murder of one of their peers. No matter his misdeeds against them, the taking of a human life is no small, casual undertaking. The story does a good job in conveying the irony of the plotting and the ultimate act of bullying against a bully. The reality of their actions does not seem to occur to them until it is too late. Many of the characters hardly seem any more redeemable than the ""bully"" himself. Their own despicable characteristics are on full display.The film contains copious amounts of sex and nudity. Numerous scenes of drug usage and conversations about drugs. And plenty of profanity.

The use of sex is pretty accurate of that culture and is the same location and energy of most high school spring break trips... there, it's just all year like that. I don't think we needed to see all of the full frontal, but I don't think it took away from the film.

Bully takes the true story of some outcast kids that were tormented by a high school bully. They decided enough was enough and sought revenge in a very violent manor. There was some fairly graphic sex scenes; it seems like this director likes to put racy sex scenes in his movies. The story was interesting, and it did a good job of creating a lot of tension. I really wanted to know what was going to happen.

159,GrtOne41,"Well Acted- Yes, Flawed- Yes, Not Clark's Best Work But Watchable",7,16 August 2003,"*SPOILERS HEREIN*Watching the kind of world the kids from Larry Clark's drama 'Bully lived in, you wonder what happened to them. It appears that no outside forces subjected them to their lifestyles; rather it was a personal choice. From Mustang driving, suburban teen sexstress Ali to whacked out acid-freak Donny, these kids have no apparent purpose other than to exist.No, these kids have sex early and often with multiple partners, do most every kind of illicit drug, and participate in mindless entertainment such as 'Fatality' video games. The adults in this story aren't the problem because of what they do; it's what they don't do. None of them seem to truly care where their children are or what they are doing, and obviously neither do the kids.The teens curse at will in front of their parents (an automatic backhand in my house growing up) and stay out until, well...whenever. Adults in this film have few lines because they do and are nothing, both to their children and in their eyes. Clark succeeds mightily here, as he makes every attempt to shift the blame to where it truly belongs- the children. There is no visual evidence that any of them go to school, work, or have any kind of ambition in life.The characters make the most of their screenplay. Brad Renfro fabulously plays the tormented, picked-on best friend Bobby. While he excels, Clark could have casted this part much better. Renfro is too adult and distinguished looking to play the senseless teen character of Marty Puccio. He looks so out of place sunk into a couch shirtless, rapping alongside Eminem, shouting ""I hate it when the cut the (bleep)in' swear words!""Stahl shines as Kent, playing the homoerotic violent dominating personality. The real show-stealer is Mike Pitt, who plays druggie Donny. The scene in which Kent is driving to his own murder talking with Ali, Heather, and Donny is amazing. Pitt's facial expressions and line of `No dude, it's Donny.definitely Donny' is funny, subversive, and scary as hell all in one. The best scene in this film. Leo Fitzpatrick, while out of place as the Mafia Hitman, is excellent as well, as is Derek. While most every actor/ess Clark casted performs well enough, the blame falls on him for casting them out of place and his screenplay.Bully builds up the murder of Kent for most of the film, and gives lots of reasons for why it happened. The only character you gather even the slightest twinge of sympathy for is Marty. He's been picked on, and beat up by Kent his entire life. One thing I didn't understand is when he fights back after arguing with Kent after accidentally damaging his Camaro and Kent coldcocks him twice. Kent then puts his arm around Kent and apologizes for his indiscretions. Did this happen with the real life Kent/Puccio? If so, why didn't Puccio fight back more?It appears that the excess teen sex depicted was supposed to 'bother' or 'disturb' the audience. The kids screw each other like rabbits. After a while, it seems that Clark is showing the nudity just to push buttons. Renfro and Rachel Miner (who plays Lisa) have sex in quite a few scenes. The point is proven early in the film that the two have an odious boy/girlfriend relationship, and have sex often. Clark made a large mistake by inserting clips of the two of them, fully nude, engaging in sex acts at pointless moments.The teen nude tip doesn't stop there. Connelley apparently likes to have phone conversations topless, and while Ali is having a phone chat, the camera drops down to her crotch, partially exposing her vagina. And while Connelley is checking for pregnancy, Clark sees fit to show her walking to, using, and walking from the toilet fully nude. The only legitimate explanation is that Clark wants to overshock people with this drivel. It takes a lot away from Bully.While the murder build up is intense, the fallout is not. It appears Clark has little interest in what happened following Kent's murder. Nothing is mentioned regarding the police investigation and little has to do with the trial. I found that most disappointing. All that is implied is that one of the kids is a snitch and caused them to get caught. The irony here is the hit on Kent was so haphazardly and sloppily planned by brainless drug addicts, these kids were doomed from the moment Connelley told Puccio ""Let's kill him.""In the end, Bully is disturbing, but not in the way Clark envisioned it. It's sad because this film could have been so much more. It ends up looking like a way for Larry to show more teen nudity/sex, drug use, and otherwise moronic behavior. The actors get an ""A"" for effort, but not even the mightiest performances can save it from mediocrity. GRADE- 6/10.P.S.- For those who have seen the trailer, did you catch the ad ploy? When the movie's tagline is displayed, ""It's 4AM, Do You Know Where Your Kids Are?"" 'Kids' is italicized. Touché Mr. Clark.touché.",Bully
160,blizzrock13,Quite simply...the worst movie I've ever seen,1,26 April 2008,"This was without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen. And that's sad, i've watched some pretty bad movies. Let me put this in perspective for you, I watched bully right before ""Wrestlemaniac"", and without question, bully was worse.It's truly rare that I can say that there is absolutely nothing good about a movie. I mean, the nudity was this movie's ONLY slightly redeeming factor, but it was used to such an excess that it was entirely ridiculous. Every time any character is alone they're automatically naked. Sometimes it doesn't even take THAT.The cinematography is so juvenile it's hard to put into words. The defining scene of this movie's cinematic genius was a circular spin reminiscent of That 70s Show. But the camera was moving SO FAST that it hurt to watch. Not only that, but it really didn't have a reason to, because half the characters weren't doing anything in this scene! Only 2 or 3 actually had lines, and the others just stood there wasting my time by making a different unbelievable facial expression every time they came on screen. I think the goal was to make it look like one continuous 4 minute scene, but since the film kept jumping at parts it was pretty obvious that it WASN'T.The plot line...where do I begin? It's so pointless, I can barely put it into words. It seems like we just progress from sex scene to sex scene with barely anything substantial connecting them, until we finally reach a murder. ""He makes me feel bad."" and the next line is ""Let's kill him."" Ughhhhh...not only that, but for whole sections of the movie the plot line is entirely lost and we're pulled off into useless scenes, like the mortal combat one. In addition, everyone in this movie is CONSTANTLY on drugs. I don't just mean they're drug users, I mean in EVERY SCENE OF THIS MOVIE, they're doing drugs...it's overkill.I'll just toss the acting and script into one. The acting wasn't believable for a moment - every character just flat and one-dimensional. Every time they attempted to throw in character development it was just pointless, absurd, and out of place. Blue-haired girl's story about her grandmother really didn't contribute anything to her character, and is the only bit of development she gets. YET WE SEE HER IN NEARLY EVERY SCENE. As for the script...I don't even know what to say. When you have lines like ""Kill him, like, kill him in real life?"" in your movie, you know you've hit rock bottom. For the first 30 minutes of the movie, I don't think we really saw any dialogue whatsoever, aside from an occasional comment between sexual moaning.The one positive thing i will say about this movie was that it was good for a laugh. I mean, if you have a bunch of sarcastic people around you, this can be a truly fun time, but it's only because the movie is so unrespectable.*****RANT OVER****** 0.8/10",Bully
161,stazz,"Fair Play, the bad pay.",8,18 November 2002,"The movie is a realistic and touching in a clever way.

Naiveness meets serious business and ends up as it should.",Bully
162,darkplague2010,A raw look at the epidemic of bullying,8,20 August 2012,"This story is sad for a variety of reasons. Marty & Bobby grew up together & were supposed ""best friends"", but Bobby was a HUGE bully & bullied Marty terribly for years. I watched both the movie & the documentary, as well as reading the book. This movie is a raw, in your face look at the epidemic of bullying & what could happen when this bullying goes too far. I'm not condoning what these kids did by any means, but I found it ironic that Bobby's family thought their son was ""too good"" for Marty, when in reality, it was THEIR son who was the problem. I was disgusted when, in the documentary, Lisa acts like she was ""so scared"" (even going so far as to keep her face shadowed), when SHE was the catalyst behind this entire plot to kill Bobby. Not only was she the one who brought up the solution of killing Bobby to Marty, but also was the only one who knew Derek the self-proclaimed gang member (he was so NOT one & even his little brothers laughed at that). After the murder, Lisa bragged to anyone who would listen about what MARTY did, never once putting any of the blame on herself. She even dragged her naive cousin, Derek, who really wanted nothing to do with this whole thing, (he was content playing video games & told Lisa he didn't want any part of it). Ironically, Derek (cousin) was pretty much bullied himself into participating. In the documentary, Allie makes herself out to be a whole lot more innocent than she really was. She was was a spoiled girl with a new Mustang, a baby that her parents took care of & would be considered ""loose"" as far as boys & sex was concerned. She had no problem going to Marty's house & taking Bobby right into the bedroom the first time she ever met him. Heather was the sad, train wreck of the group. She had a miserable life in a violent family. Donnie was nothing more than a hanger-on who was pretty much up for anything & very much a follower, as well as completely under Allie's ""sex spell"". Derek, (wannabe ""gangster""), portrayed himself as a ""thug"", so when these kids came to him for help with their scheme, he had to take the role as leader. If he didn't, he would be exposed & everyone would see him for the nobody he really was instead of a ""gangster"". As much as I would like to, I can't feel very much sympathy for Bobby Kent. True, nobody should die like that, but in addition to his appalling every day treatment of Marty, he degraded females, calling them the ""b word"" & ""w word"" (no profanity can be used in a review) & used them for rough sex even if they didn't want to. Bobby had no problem humiliating Marty in public & in private, both verbally & physically. Notice that Bobby was much bigger & stronger than the slightly built Marty. Would this have happened without the coercing of Lisa? Maybe. Marty had never stuck up for himself throughout his entire life when it came to Bobby Kent, so I doubt that he ever would have. After Lisa relentlessly keeps the pressure on Marty that the only way to ""get rid of"" Bobby & his bullying is to kill him, I think Marty (in extremely bad judgment) most likely felt that this would be the only way to ever get rid of Bobby. I thought it was really sad how Bobby humiliates Marty in front of people, beats him up on a regular basis & makes Marty's life a living hell. And Bobby is supposed to be Marty's ""best friend since childhood""? The bottom line of this whole story is that NOBODY won, not to mention the fact that it was 6 on 1. With those odds, the outcome for Bobby wasn't very good. Marty got rid of Bobby, but now he's in prison & probably getting bullied by people far worse than Bobby Kent. Lisa Connelly has she & Marty's baby in prison, Allie's child has no mother, Heather has just continued her family history of violence, Derek (cousin) was a pretty good kid who got caught up in his cousin's scheme & wasted what life he may have had. Donnie (the person people knew the least about), is in the same boat as the others & Derek, the fake gangbanger, is finding himself in the gang world of prison & he sure won't ""fit in"". All the actors/actresses in this movie did an excellent job. Nick Stahl was amazing in his portrayal of Bobby Kent. Like I said, I'm trying to find some sympathy for Bobby, but it's hard. I was bullied all through school from Kindergarten through high school to the point where I dropped out of school & got my GED. The ramifications of this bullying is still with me years later. Killing a bully is obviously not the answer, but what is? It seems like today, kids don't listen to their parents, teachers or anyone who's tries to tell them they're not going in the right direction. To those that are bullied, it's hard to realize that school won't last forever & that they WILL survive, but it's easier said than done. Both murder & suicide are permanent solutions to temporary problems. People need to speak up & stand up when bullying going on, but it's not always out in the open. A lot of the bullying that Bobby did to Marty was in private & from the details of this case, neither set of parents knew what was going on between the two. The bottom line is that situations like this, as well as school shootings, etc., will continue. There are no easy answers, but the fact that it's out in the open finally is a step in the right direction.",Bully
163,Garymc,"Another Great ""small"" movie",9,30 November 2004,"Bully is about 2 teenage boys, one of which does what the other tells him to do and doesn't do anything about it until he meets a girl who makes him realize that he can........and therefore he will. I enjoyed this movie and love watching these small films that come around not so often. The director makes great work of the unknown actors in this movie and it works really well. This film is like real life and gives you a good view of all the characters and lets you feel for them and sort of know what they are going through with the ""Bully"". It's much better this way, better than most movies whose characters are so flawed you don't care what happens to them, I actually wanted the ""victims"" plan to work and hoped they would get away with it. The story builds up well and doesn't let you get bored and keeps you entertained, whether it be by a bit of nakedness or a bit of bullying, or both together. Overall I would give it 9/10, nearly a perfect movie and it would be a good idea for any teenagers to watch this because it is so near what happens a lot in real life.",Bully
164,chrismerrick759,Expected Much More,4,25 April 2014,"After seeing and enjoying Ken Park and Kids, I was definitely interested in giving this film a watch. Larry Clark has a unique directing style, which comes out well in Kids and Ken Park, but not so much Bully. The IMDb plot was very intriguing, it got a 7/10 so I was expecting a decent movie, but was unfortunately let down with this one. There are some major points where this movie fails, the main one being the acting, which I will talk about first.The acting in this film, for lack of a better word, is crap. I first noticed this, during a scene where a teenage girl just encounters some trauma, and goes to tell her friend about it, and is trying to hide the smirk on her face, and it's not believable at all. Stuff like this goes on throughout the whole film, it's just really unbelievable, which is weird, because I have seen a few of the actors in this, do very well in other films. This was the main failure of the film, the only character that was really believable to me was Bobby Kent, played by Nick Stahl.Now, this film had an interesting story, which apparently was based on a true story, while the film exaggerates some parts, as you would expect. The film fails to bring this story to life and make it believable, there are so many plot holes, and so many parts where you are asking yourself ""Are a bunch of young adults really stupid enough, to do/say this s**t?"". That is what was going on in my mind for half the film, also there seemed to be many points, where the same questions get asked and answered, over and over again.This is most of what I have to say about the film, but the last thing I have to mention, is a scene where they are talking in a circle, and to shoot it, someone just stands in the middle of the circle spinning the camera around. I have a feeling Larry Clark was trying to copy the scene at the beginning of Reservoir Dogs, but he failed here. It was just a pointless gimmick that was ultimately annoying, and I ended up skipping the scene, because it was making me feel sick, as the circle was much smaller then in Reservoir Dogs. I give props to Larry Clark for trying to make this story on film, but he didn't succeed in my eyes, and made a movie that I wouldn't say is worth anyone's time. This made me hesitant to check out his other films, and question the people who gave this film a high rating.",Bully
165,digg5555,Portrays the decadent and violent reality of teen life today,9,15 December 2005,"Very real and compelling portrayal of a murder involving a group of teens growing up in suburban Florida. I could relate to the characters on many levels. Growing up in suburban Philadelphia I could have easily replaced the characters in the movie with people I in knew in my youth. It was a rude reminder of just how easily things can spiral out of control if you get involved with the wrong crowd and put yourself in such a precarious situation.Although there were some parts of the movie that seemed over dramatized, it captures the violent and self destructive lifestyle American teens are exposed to, and the story is very well told and acted. Some might be put off by the crude sex and violence, but if you are able to look past that it a very entertaining movie that I would highly recommend.",Bully

Although I've seen some pretty messed up sht in my day, this definitely had me questioning wtf is wrong with today's youth.

In fact, if I buy the rights of the book ""Bully"", I could make a film from this book WAY better than Larry Clark.

168,murphy-38,"Raw, Disturbing and True",8,17 July 2001,"My curiosity builds with filmmaker Larry Clark.  Is he a radical or secretly working for the conservative right?  Clark delivers this film with the intensity of  `Kids'.  By giving the audience a simple story rapped around teenage sex, drugs, and revenge.  Based on a true story, Marty Puccio (actor Brad Renfro) and his friends are tired of being bullied by Bobby Kent (actor Nick Stahl). Kent is by no means a pleasant friend to hang around with. Constantly belittling those around him, taking anything he desires, raping anybody he knows and in the end he shrugs it off.  So how do you get rid of this menace???  Simple kill him.  That's the conclusion of which his friends have come across too.  It's simple right?  No one will find out, man? It's like a video game, huh?  Larry Clark supplies us with a very simple answer and a costly price of stupidity.  After viewing this film, would one be truly offended by it graphic depicture of ordinary kids?  After thinking about it, I don't think so.  For the radicals you have graphic sex, drugs and anything which may turn you on.  On the other hand if your conservative, then this tale would re-enforce the belief drugs, underage sex, and a lack of discipline doesn't pay off.  Overall, with it's superb acting, direction, and photography, I give it an eight.",Bully

170,dtwizzyfan,Clark pushes the envelope and sends a scrambled message.,4,16 April 2007,"This was the first Larry Clark film I saw, and is probably one of the worst. The direction is bland and routine, the screenplay tries to be authentic but seems contrived. The characters are all ridiculously stupid, to the point you have trouble sympathizing with any of them. There were a few powerful sequences, but not enough to create a great sense of atmosphere.The problem I have with Clark is not the fact that he seems immersed in the lives of teenagers (though this is quite an unhealthy habit). He just doesn't break new ground often. Part of what made Kids so successful was the question mark over Clark's unique cinema verite style. As I said, this was the first Clark film I saw, but I had heard enough about him to know what to expect.Quick synopsis: Marty Puccio and Bobby Kent have been 'best friends' since just after they were born. However, Marty is growing tired of Bobby's physical and psychological abuse, and doesn't know how to escape it. Enter Lisa Connelly and Ali Willis, a pair of female friends who become more than a little involved with Marty and Bobby. They too grow tired of Bobby's abusive nature. Lisa suggests to Marty that they should kill Bobby, and Marty agrees without much hesitation at all. Marty, Lisa, Ali, and three other friends conspire to murder Bobby. They enlist the help of a 'hit-man', Derek Kaufman. Of course, it takes them ages to kill Bobby and almost all of the murderers are swallowed by their guilt.Bully is as much about the murder of Bobby Kent as it is about the lifestyle of aimless, hedonistic teenage. In three words; sex, drugs and booze. I wasn't disturbed by the amount of nudity, and nothing really shocked me, though I do think Clark was quite pervasive on this front. True, the teenagers depicted would have been having sex quite a lot, but is it really necessary that we witness every moment of coitus? I didn't really add to the story at all.One of Bully's major letdowns is the fact that it takes itself too seriously. The dialogue is laughably bad at times, and the characters idiocy continues to switch between frustrating and amusing. I realize that some moments were meant to be humorous, but some potentially powerful moments were botched with either terrible dialogue or poor acting. Kids could afford moments of strange dialogue or average acting because, despite the underlying political statement, it was about teenagers having fun. Having fun and murdering a bisexual rapist are totally different subjects.The acting? It was nothing special. Brad Renfro scowled his way through the movie (as he does and most movies). He played his role quite well (though admittedly, he always looks like he is going to murder someone), but it wasn't an excellent performance. Nick Stahl was good, but totally miscast. Rachel Miner looked particularly devious throughout the whole film, and did what she could with a taxing role. Phillips and Garner were quite poor, but that's not surprising. Fitzpatrick looked the part, but wasn't terribly convincing as a hit-man. He suited Telly in Kids, and did a great job for a young ""actor"", but he is no acting expert. At least his dialogue was a bit clearer in Bully though.The stand out is Michael Pitt, as the slightly deranged but forever entertaining Donny Semenec. He's crazy, always high, and genuinely funny. He provides this film with three of my four stars.The characters are all stupid. The murder wasn't pulled off very well, and the scenes when they are all together (getting high, bonking, etc.) are painfully empty. I didn't really sympathize with them enough to get involved in the story.It was also a shame to see that Clark never really exploited the irony of this story. Bobby Kent was the only College bound character in the story, but this only gets mentioned in scatter-shot moments. When you've got potential irony in a story, you have to exploit it. No excuses.People have said that this is a true representation of the youth of America. True. However, at the end of the day, the movie was supposed to be about Marty Puccio and his friends murdering Bobby Kent. The story (or lack thereof), failed to impress me.",Bully

172,jamesbondandq,"very entertaining, powerful movie",10,19 February 2002,"I just finished watching 'Bully' and felt like commenting. I had read many reviews before watching it and was really surprised how much different it was then i expected it to be. I had expected a movie very similar to kids, but i felt that Bully was far less reality emulating then kids. Kids was very much a movie documenting the lives of teens in new york, and it felt totally authentic, very much like a documentry. Bully was a completely different style tho, i had heard a lot about how bittingly real it is, but when watching it i felt it was more a movie from kids perspective, then looking at kids. the narrative feels like the experience of looking at things as a teen. I'm 18, and can relate to the viewpoint. I think a lot of people missed how lighthearted a lot of this movie is and how funny it is. I was laughing through most of it up until the murder, where suddenly everything fell into place where the reality set in. Then after the murder things begin to slowly unravel, and then the final scene is once again not very serious, and it still seems like there's not going to be much consequence and that everything will be ok. Then abruptly the sentences are shown on screen, and the reality sinks in. I felt the movie was brilliant in how it made you understand the kids so well in the movie, it was like being a silent viewer in the group. As far as many other writers finding the characters unsympathetic, i felt a lot for all of the characters, including bobby, they just seemed misguided. It felt almost as if they had made it through those few years in their lives, the after time would be ok, by 25 they'd be doing alright. It portrayed that awkward period so well. As far as the voyeuristic nudity side is concerned, once again i felt that reflected great with the adolescent side of the movie, immersing the viewer in the mindset of that age. Overall i thought it was a fantastic movie, and one of the best of the year. In a perfect world the nominees for best picture of 2001 would be: Man who wasn't there, In the bedroom, Mulholland drive, Ghost World and Bully. Oh well, see them all!!Don't believe the hype, Bully is VERY different from kids.Very entertaining, with a powerful message. Too bad it didn't get much of a chance in the theatres. People need to stop overlooking movies like this, they are very important. Movies that mean something and take you into a another world, so that when you leave, you understand a little bit better, or feel a little bit more normal.Kids do stupid things not because they're stupid but because everything is so important and they don't think about the consequences of what they're doing. In the moment, that's what it is. Oh well. It's an awkward time...I'll stop preaching.See the movie with an open mind.10/10",Bully

Harmony Korine was the director of Gummo, he had nothing to do with the writing or directing of this film. This film is R rated. If female nudity makes you feel uncomfortable, and sex scenes disturb you, stop reading now.still with me?   ....cool, on to the review.Bully is a dark, gritty story about a bunch of young, dumb, perpetually wasted wasted f*ckups who want to murder their friend, but have no idea what they are doing, or how to go about it. The characters aren't ""cool"" or ""slick"", they're a bunch of idiots, and are cleverly portrayed as such with purpose and intent. This movie is much closer in feel to Kids than Another Day in Paradise, and like Kids, portrays a group of young Americans doing what they do, talking how they talk, screwing how they screw, with complete objectivity. There is no opinion to form, no message to learn, just a harshly realistic moving photograph. It is entertaining and artful without trying to be.If this sounds interesting to you, I'd recommend checking it out.If you've ever played Mortal Kombat while tripping on acid, go buy it!

175,onethemovie,"False advertising as ""based on true story.""",1,3 March 2003,"It is advertised as based on true story, but after watching the movie it does not take much to convince me that the people involved in the murder of Marty Puccio were indeed out to give their own version of justice. It is more of one-sided story than anything, rather than fair and impartial view of the story.  It is like the defendant of the Puccio's murder trial told the whole version of story.  It is best summed up as exaggeration, fictional and false advertising.Larry Clark did a great job directing the controversial 1995 movie, Kids. However, in this movie, his directing performance was erratic.  His writing work was disastrous.  In one scene where the kids were talking of a plan to whack Puccio out of misery, the camera went spin around the crowd which was incredibly annoying, thus made me lose my `suspension of disbelief.'It is a movie good for people who like the nude and sex scene (rape scene included).  The actresses looked so young in the movie that it was like watching real minors actually disrobed for that movie.  Other than that, the movie was beyond terrible.",Bully

There are too many shots that try to provoke the viewer and fail to do so. This wears off rather quickly as well. Maybe 2013 is just too progressive in comparison to 2001. There are better movies and series that explore the transformation of a normal person into a bad guy. Wouldn't really recommend (anymore?), only if the OV significantly improves the quality of the dialog. I might give this a second try, though, because this dub seemed to be especially awful and I would like to compare the versions.",Bully

Tip: If you have trouble watching graphic violence, then get the R rated version which makes both the violence and sex less explicit. I thought the way the ending was directed was beautiful.

178,davejr91,One of the best,10,10 May 2015,"A film that will continuously be in your thoughts for years after viewing it. In fact, it has been sometime since I last watched this, but having stumbled upon it again here, I feel it's my duty to give it the review it deserves. Bully is quite simply, one of the best movies ever made. A sweeping statement I know, but having watched thousands of a similar vein, I can't ever tire of the dangerously hypnotic truth that sets these characters apart from so many. Each living the American Dream, or so they believe, yet their actual lives are thick with angst and desperately torn by insecurities that they fulfil with drugs and sex. Clarke's ability to depict them as the true, purified white trash they are, is a depressing portrait of the teens that fight against the seemingly dull reality of life. We meet Marty & Bobby, friends at heart, yet closer to the shore are signs of detrimental physical and mental abuse. Bobby's battles are somewhat deeper than Marty's, but both live uncertain lives. Bobby's issues are with his father, his sexuality and the claustrophobia that new friends can bring when Marty is no longer his 'best pal'. Then in comes Lisa, Marty's one and only true love – a fresh faced young, but naive girl who only wants the best for her blooming boyfriend. Add punk Heather and fun-loving Ali and the recipe is starkly brilliant for the melting pot they are about to enter. Various encounters Bobby has with both Marty and Heather lead to the rest of the group deciding Bobby's fate. As I'm sure most of you will be able to piece together the puzzle, I won't spell out for you the rest as it really is something you need to experience yourself.The thing about this film is that, such a simple premise, can make for such impending questions about society and life. What we believe to see, as harmless and pathetic teenagers trying to get by, turns into a sincere questions about the realms of life, friendship and morality. Clarke digs deep underneath the spectrum to upturn the lives of these symbolically 'innocent' teens, to show the audience the very fact these individuals thought they would get away with such a crime, yet this is something we are able to believe – these kids aren't a product of society but society is a product of them. An example pans to the end of the film when Ali asks her mother directly whether or not if one of her friends was part of a murder or crime, how important would it be to report it? This is a great depiction of how naive these kids are and the belief that anything they did or carried out was completely above suspicion. What we're left with is a sour taste in our mouth, unable to truly process the events carried out in the second half. Clarke doesn't miss out any detail - certain scenes are fuelled with sex, violence and drugs, but this is done with dramatic effect and for the audience to delve into the lives of these delinquents, to try and understand their lives and backgrounds. What also always got me was the true form of Marty's and Lisa's love, initially it's quite hard to believe the authenticity of their passion, but as the film evolves, their relationship becomes so boldly intense. Soon we realise that Lisa's love for Marty doesn't hold back on any episode, the fight to the bitter end sends her in a dismay of love, hate and anger that sets to blow her final fuse of guilt as she confesses everything to her friend. The ending is something that to me, always stands out, and brings an array of emotions to front which when you have gone on the journey with these characters, can't help but feel confused, bitter and angry. With the fear of over-telling, I can't promote this film enough, if you like to explore the darker sides to humanity that haven't necessarily been explored then this is something you should experience. You'll never regret it.",Bully
179,stevejohnsenson,Much is spoken regarding existential nudity,7,2 November 2005,"There has been many discussions regarding the nudity and sexual expression amongst the youthful subjects of this delightfully disturbing film. Much has been overblown or misunderstood. The genius of the entire project: IT blurs the distinction between artist, author, and recipient; antithesis becomes indistinct as this work explores the activities of contortionists, spiritual voyeurs and lyrical activists, alike, notwithstanding the obvious comparisons people will make with Debi Pike, spouse of the Troubadour. Actress Rachel Miner, a nubile young protégé of troubadour Kirsten Dunst , in homage to ""Spiderman II"", comes full circle experiencing both the allegorical mock suicide attempt and ultimate resurrection during the outworking of the story (though I'll refrain from the details to avoid a possible spoiler). The soundtrack, in deference to Roy Clark, and all of those weaned on the radical musicologists of the 1970's made me weep in pleasure and recollection. This is urban mythology presented in a manner which brings Dylan, Proust, and Finis Dake together in a phantasmagoric orgy of Dake-Bonoist ecstasy. This entire account is based, faithfully, on true events that occurred in 1992 in southern Florida shortly after hurricane Andrew. Nonetheless it is a remains a mythological urban folk tale for the 21st century and beyond. Ever adolescent fantasy and vice is represented in spectronomic Technicolor. Classic archetypes of tragedy, death, love, and resurrection and interwoven into the subplot, belaying this entire work into our collective anxieties regarding the futility that lies in attempting to establish a personal legacy.It isn't difficult to pay attention to this cinematic Emergency Broadcast, networked between all the bare breasted Barbies and Butches of the world and exuding an unremitting montage that obfuscates the distinction between looking at an image and giving it to someone else. The mental imagery and etymological collage overlap each other, creating a salient textured mass of sensory immolation which provides ENDLESS opportunities for subversion. Despite the revulsion one feels, The youth of your city block will relate to each and every enactment within the actions of their schoolmates and partners. This film is a tragic paradigm shift, impelling one to grasp the real and the fantastic in a bonoistic conversion of delight and sorrow. I can't recommend this any more than I already am. You will want to watch this movie over and over again.The knife only went in but so far. Yet guilty one could be?",Bully
180,oasis1,The worst acting I've EVER seen,4,17 November 2020,"Where do I start...as the title of this review suggests, this movie has the worst acting I've ever seen. That's not an exaggeration. The whole movie is just plain weird. The cinematography is appalling as well, what's with the spinning camera? It's laughable. And why is everyone so desperate to tell other people about what they did, like that would happen! The only saving grace is the two lead male actors who do an ok acting performance, everyone else is shocking. Other than that the death scene was good",Bully
181,TheGandiman,An Underachievement in Film,1,23 February 2002,"I was shocked to see all the positive reviews this film has received.  I question why anyone would consider this film to be a masterpiece, when in reality it's a filmmaker's attempt to exploit a ""based on a true story"" account.  I think that if this movie had not been based on a real event, that it would not have had the obvious leaps of faith shown in some of the positive reviews I read.I agree with the decision to film the movie in the most gritty, realistic way possible, but that seems to have been the only good decision the filmmakers made.  The casting was horrible.  Their fresh faces and hard bodies did not convey the drug-abusing, low self esteemed kids involved in the true event.Was everyone really so convinced that Nick Stahl was such a horrifying bully?  He was as scary as a ant.  One good asskicking would have taken care of the situation.  The threat was not there.Rachel Miner couldn't decide whether she wanted to be ""crazy"" or just ""confused"".  Brad Renfro's good looks and obvious superior physical stature over Stahl's also make him a doubtful victim of being bullied.And finally, why are adults always depicted as such one-dimensional dolts? When Ali asks her Mom, ""Can you call a hotline to report a murder?(paraphrased), her response to her is ""Oh, Ali what are you kids up to?""  What??  If the adults were depicted as realistically as the kids were, then perhaps the story would have carried so much more weight.The biggest culprit is Clark, who just wanted to show people how cool and controversial he could be with a camera in his hands.  He violated everything sacred in making a good movie - especially how to tell a story! In one scene, he scans down to one of the female character's crotch while she's getting a pedicure - for no reason!Truly disappointing.",Bully

I can't believe that, that actually happened in real life. It was scary to think that kids can be that cruel. I really liked the characters acting and their plots. And in the end, they all got what the deserve but got their revenge all at the same time. Very well done. It's got a lot of profanity and nudity in it and definitely not something I'd let my kids watch but I hope that older teens who do watch it can learn something from it. But I liked how everything worked out in the end. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the characters were so worried about what they did and what would happen to them that they told people and I guess that's how they ended up in prison and some even sentenced to life.",Bully
183,bige22079,'Bully' (2001) definitely qualifies as a worthy follow-up-film to Larry Clark's controversial 'Kids' (1995).,10,24 April 2002,"> Marty Puccio is a high school drop-out living in Hollywood, Florida with his neglectful parents.  Marty is constantly pressured and beaten by his life-long friend Bobby Kent.  Bobby leads Marty into a sub-cultural lifestyle involving sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll.  Bobby enjoys forcing Marty into uncomfortable situations, like pimping Marty at a local gay bar, and Marty does nothing but submit to Bobby's purely evil nature.  After `going out' with equally troubled and promiscuous teens Ali and Lisa, Bobby's reputation as rapist and total asshole extends to four other marginal teens. Together, these seven brain-dead adolescents premeditate Bobby's death with spinning confusion and commit the gruesome murder with excessive incompetence and collective guilt.  Their appropriate convictions result from an `anonymous tip.'Bully deserves to be more widely seen because it offers a shocking yet brutally honest social criticism of family values amidst the excessive consumerism of a capital economy.  The eight teens of the film represent the entire spectrum of contemporary over-privileged middle class youth, and their extra curricular activities include surfing, petty car audio crimes, video games, prostitution, excessive drug use, cruising in sports cars, pornography, and extreme sexual activity.  The extent of these adolescent activities are  indeed controversial, but the portrayal of the parental figures is just as shocking.  The parents are naive at best and possess a complete lack of understanding for the sub-cultural lifestyle their children lead.  Marty, black-eyed and bloody, begs his parents to move far away. They refuse, claiming that they just can't leave their jobs.  Bobby's wealthy bourgeois father preaches correctness, quick capital gain, and entrepreneurship, but he is too busy to actually get involved.  Lisa's mother, an ex-Brooklyn native, acts as the voice of reason claiming that, `all you kids do is lay around, drive your cars, and eat us out of house and home.'  Honestly, free time is the devil's workshop, but for some reason, the parents are content with handing these spoiled children whatever expensive toys their economic status affords while neglecting to spend the necessary time to get involved and reinforce family values.  The ending punctuates this point.  The seven guilty teens feverishly quarrel and pass guilt during their pretrial, while revealing the embarrassing specifics of the murder for everyone to hear.  The camera then offers a reaction montage of sullen faces as the parents sit in total astonishment.  The parents still don't understand.",Bully
184,MalikC71,soft porn with better acting,4,1 October 2003,"I'm no prude by any stretch, but more story and less sex would have been nice.  I like my porn to come with an opaque, brownish/blackish plastic bag and bad acting, like any self-respecting, red-blooded american male.
Bijou Phillips seems to have a penchant for playing these annoyingly promiscuous low lifes (Black and White).  They may be fun and challenging for the actor, but not very compelling to watch, in my opinion.
I can see why somebody would want to tell this fact-based story to a wide audience; the events themselves are compelling and baffling.  However, I just don't know why these people couldn't make a choice to not hang around this bully.  I mean, I'm sure that there are people this stupid in real life, but I don't really want to waste two hours watching them.",Bully
185,KaosSeeker,Crap that tries to be provocative,3,4 September 2002,"This movie was so bad, it wasn't even funny.  I really admire what Larry Clark did with KIDS.  In fact it was on again recently and it still holds up just as contemporary as when I first saw it upon it's initial release. Bully pales in comparison.  It's actually hard to believe that the same man directed both of these flicks.  And Bijou Phillips?  What is up with her? Everything that she is in she comes across as a cheap sleazebag looking for attention.  Just because you have a famous parent does not mean that you warrant stardom or can act.  Miss Phillips is a prime example of this. Even Nick Stahl, who I normally like, was over the top, and there's nothing worse than seeing actors you usually like tripping over themselves.  Why this movie got so much hype I have no idea.  But my advice would be to pass this mish mash and enjoy your time with something/anything else.",Bully
186,zac917,A Lost Generation,8,17 August 2009,"Larry Clark's ""Bully"" is a hard hitting, raw, and profane film but none the less relentlessly effective and entertaining. After watching the un-edited version of ""Bully"" any audience member will feel some sort of effect. It may be wanting to punch your T.V. or holding your son or daughter; and this was Larry Clark's exact intention. ""Bully"" is a film about two longtime friends ( Brad Renfro and Nick Stahl) who live troubled lives. Both are confused in the way the world works but don't mind taking advantage of the common confusion shared by the opposite sex. It is through these sex scenes that the viewer feels the most negative about Nick Stahl's character. The way this character interacts with others is vile yet very believable. And after constant abuse Brad Renfro's character and the other characters in the film decide to handle this Bully once and for all. ""Bully"" could easily of been a one sided attack on troubled teen's parents and showing how evil some ""kids"" can be. But Clark is too smart for that path, instead taking a different route by showing how some teens can fall into these depths of depravity. He shows Nick Stahl's character as being as evil as possible but through some of the subtle (and not so) details of the film the viewer begins to grow sympathetic for Nick Stahl's character as the audience knows that he is the most troubled being among the whole group. The end may be easy to see coming, since it is a true story but there is no need to give that information here. But note that the last twenty five minutes of the film will leave you breathless. The performances in this film are all outstanding and very brave, the talented cast includes: Brad Renfro, Nick Stahl, Bijou Philips, Michael Pitt,and Leo Fitspatrick (from ""Kids"" fame). Every one of these actors give great performances. ""Bully"" is a film that may turn off some viewers for it's extreme content; and the content can be very extreme, but this should not detour film goers. Because ""Bully"" is a film that offers non stop entertainment, dark comedy (very dark), quick pace, great performances, a truly realistic feel (a Clark staple) anda lasting message. ""Bully"" is a film that shows the lost generation in the most extreme light; let it be exposed.",Bully
187,rubybaybee,Good except for all the unnecessary sex scenes between Renfro and Miner...,6,20 April 2009,"Well first off, as far as acting goes, they all did a pretty good job. For me though, the best performance was by Nick Stahl as Bobby, the ""bully"" of ""Bully."" I couldn't stand his character, yet at the same time, I found myself disturbed and disgusted by the scene where he was brutally murdered by his supposed best friend and his gang of skeevy accomplices. I also found it sad that the only character with any real potential for a future was the one that was killed, although I know this film was based on a true story so I guess that aspect couldn't really be altered too much. Yes, Bobby was a perverted closet homosexual and a wacked-out psychopath who fed his sadistic nature by beating up his best friend Marty on a regular basis, verbally abusing him to bring down his self-esteem, raping girls, and raping Marty even. But deep down, looking past of all his screwed up flaws and mental issues, you could see that he had potential as a human being to excel in life and make something of himself, as well as the possibility of changing his ways and actually becoming a decent person, maybe after finally coming out of the closet and realizing Marty would still be his friend without being forced to stick around through constant physical and verbal abuse.The rest of the characters annoyed me quite a bit. Marty seemed to have absolutely no depth, minus his desperation to escape the torment of being his best friend's b*tch. His girlfriend Lisa was even worse, with her needy and clingy obsession with Marty, even though she knew nothing about him except that he was a hot ""surfer babe"" who was good in bed and as much of a nymphomaniac as she was. Ali was your typical sl*t with zero sexual boundaries, willing to basically screw anyone and anything that was a willing participant, including her female drug addict friend Heather, another irritatingly shallow character. Heather's character was that of a skanky dirty-looking bored teenage girl just out of drug rehab. Donny was somewhat entertaining with his obvious stupidity and cluelessness, although he was just as burned out as Heather was, if not more so. Derek really served no purpose as far as characters go. He was just sort of there to go along for the ride. And Leo, the supposed hit man, was just a loser to put it lightly; a loser with a bad temper, actually.The only thing that these characters really have in common is that they are all bored, stupid, rich, spoiled, doped up on drugs, and have the sex drive of a rabbit during the spring time. The sex scenes between Marty and Lisa were too often and completely unromantic. They lacked any real chemistry and had an empty physical relationship that for some reason has Lisa convinced that it was true love. To be honest, the relationship between Marty and Lisa drove me nuts because it reminded me of a relationship I once had when I was around the same age they were. That was probably the only aspect of the movie I could really relate to considering I've never been that bored or wealthy that I decided to gather up some random acquaintances and go murder someone I don't care much for.As far as plots go, the story is tragically pathetic due to the characters being so eager to kill this guy that they were completely unprepared to handle the consequences of getting caught, which naturally, they did. It's a sad story, especially since it's true, but like I said, the only character I liked was the actual bully, Bobby. The rest of them were just plain annoying. And to be honest, if that's how these dumb kids actually were in reality, then I'm glad they're in prison. They shouldn't be allowed to reproduce anyway. My rating is 6 out of 10 stars, strictly for Stahl's character.",Bully

Ah well, it's good if you're 13 and want to see naked chicks all around.Actors in this movie weren't bad, this I noticed. I mean you can't really call this ""thing"" a ""movie"" since it has such a stupid plot that it may be understood as no plot at all. There's a good and a bad buy. Bad guy treats a good boy bad.

I assumed it was going to be some lame teen movie we've seen time and time again. I was absolutely wrong! Bully has to be one of the most powerful and disturbing films I've EVER seen. The acting is superb, especially by Leo Fitzgerald and Daniel Franzese. The real star of the film is Nick Stahl as Bobby Kent. While he doesn't look even remotely like the real Bobby Kent, his portrayal is simply amazing. It's a shame his performance was largely overlooked. This film is definitely not for everyone.

All of the lines were super cheesy and unrealistically spoken. I thought a story line of young kids doing lots of drugs and having lots of sex and plotting a murder would be much more entertaining but it's not at all.

It started OK, it had some sense. A teen was upset because the friend was always pissing him off, then he and his new girlfriend plan to kill him. Everything's fine until here ... Unfortunately, the plot in it's fullest view seems somehow a bit absurd.I mean, do you usually see a bunch of kids who don't know too much about each other planning to kill another kid? Still, from what I've heard and read afterwards, it is based on a true story, so that makes me think that American teens have sh1t in their brains. I'm not trying to provoque anybody with this statement, but how can someone be that stupid like the way they show in the movie ? They just committed a crime and go around telling everybody what they did? That's stupid.I didn't felt any emotion about any of the characters. At the start of the movie it seemed that the director just wanted to show the 'kids' having sex. Marty is making out with Lisa one night ... right after that, they are already dating ... and right on the next minute she is pregnant.Overall, it had an interesting start, but in the end is just plain dumb.",Bully

196,lambsy_uk,Enjoyed IT & Made Me Think!,7,8 March 2013,"What I like about this film was the way it made me think about things, how teenagers think, how naive they are, how a bit of guidance was required, and how they'd feel about what they had done later in life.The film started by doing a good job of making me fell that Bobby was a nasty piece of work who deserves what's coming to him, but then you realise they are all a bunch of misguided idiots who probably deserve all they get also.In the end Bobby is a messed-up teenager who has a father who loves him very much, who will be heart-broken by his death, you are led to appreciate that such violent acts have far reaching consequences, there's far more to this than gaining revenge over a bully.The group who plot the deed talk themselves into it, many believing that if they didn't actually push the knife then there was no blood on their hands, just being there didn't equate to taking part.In summary it showed what a mess this was, kids who didn't appreciate the full consequences of what they were doing, all in denial, many felt that telling all their other friends about it was a cool thing to do, and the fact is if they hadn't spent so much time hanging out with each other and had used their time more constructively, none of this would have happened. Mob-mentality took over, each fuelling the other's egos, none wanting to back out in front of the others, bravado leading to the death of a teenager, who just happened to also be a bully, 20 years later they'll be thinking ""If only I knew then what I know now""!

The girl gets RAPED by the bully and then tells her best friend that hes cool and to go out with him. And she gets raped. I thing the guys girlfriend should get killed.

198,Captainnn,A great film about the frail dark sides of suburbia.,9,21 January 2007,"Let me Start off that I think that this is the best Clark film. It has the deepest story and the most developed characters. While Kids and Ken park show the lives of individual teenagers, this film shows us a group of kids who have problem. The problem is named Bobby Kent.Bobby has been Marty's best friend since they were young. This isn't the normal type of relationship. Bobby picks on Marty and pretty much treats him like crap. The only Marty stays with him is because he has no one else .Our main characters meet two females and 'hook up' with them. Throughout the film, Bobby manages to rape both women and our group of protagonists decide to kill him off.There is a planning process involved in order to kill him and that's where they hire Leo F. from Clark's earlier film KIDS as the hit-man. As the process evolves, more characters come into the picture.the film then turns suspenseful up to the murder scene and while dying, bobby's cry of help for Marty haunts the viewers. The remainder of the film is pretty much the character's downfall in similar fashion of Dead Presidents (1995). The kids confided in their friends and the viewers can get a sense of the foreshadowing that ensues. The cops eventually find out and the kids are tried for their actions ranging from 15 years-Death.Overall, this film was excellent. It showed the dark sides of suburbia and a group of kids who don't have anything to look forward to.",Bully

I know as a bullied kid myself, I wanted to kill my bully but never had the chance. I am hoping this film will try and help those who have been bullied get over it.  It sure helped me.

201,nicolmcclelland,Controversial shouldn't always be considered a 'unmissable',2,22 June 2006,"Films like Larry Clarks 'Bully' seem to be becoming more and more popular. Unknown actors and the 'fly on the wall' style is now considered an 'arty' form of film making, and I'm all for trying out different styles and ideas. I'm also all for films that challenge the audience, make us feel uncomfortable, and don't gloss over the truth with happy ever afters.However, this film far exceeds all of the above. It is grotesque, horrendous, and UN -beleivably painful to watch. I bought it because i had seen 'Kids' (another film of Clarks) which i thought was superb. This took everything that was good about that film, added 50 scenes of animalistic sex, explicit language, graphic violence, and more. There is absolutely no point to this film. It isn't entertaining, in fact, its the exact opposite. I finished watching it and had this immense need to stress how awful it is.. It doesn't teach us anything, we have absolutely NO feelings with any of the characters, and its repetitive need to focus on sex is boring.We don't have to enjoy films to make them good, thats obvious. Bully has absolutely nothing about it that i could use to encourage one to watch it. The ONLY positive is the acting, again, like in Kids, the young people used in the film are incredibly believable.

Throughout my entire viewing, i couldn't stop thinking how empty all the dialog was, and wondered if there would be any kind of pivotal scene. The only redeeming factor was the very end, as in the credits, when i discovered that this had apparently actually happened. However, i think the fact that it failed to entertain before i knew it was based on actual events says a lot about the quality of the film, and begs the question ""Does this movie only serve as a visual aid to the book, and not as a movie that can stand by itself?"" My answer is yes. I think that if u have a real interest in the story or have read the book this movie might be vaguely interesting, but otherwise i'd skip it. The characters are under-developed, there's nothing particularly interesting about the directing or cinematography...just a hole lot of empty sex scenes and violence.

In one scene everyone was over this girls Lisa's house in her bedroom with the door closed. Her boyfriend, the other two kids from palm bay, which they were making out having sex while everyone talked about how they were going to kill bobby. I would never allow my daughter & friends in her bedroom with the door closed laying on the bed & floor together without knowing exactly what was going on. None of them worked except marty & bobby, no one had a diploma, Where were the parents in making sure that these kids got a GED or had a job instead of laying around getting into trouble. I feel the parents in the movie were displayed as irresponsible as to not being involved enough to make sure these kids worked or had an education. They were displayed as to trusting to allow them to all be in a bedroom where the door was closed & didn't think they were actually doing anything. I don't know if the parents were actually that naive. This was actually a sad movie to see these teenage kids pull themselves in a hole that they couldn't get out of. I think it was attributed to very poor guidance & involvement by the parents.",Bully
204,tara-petric,awful,1,18 August 2006,"before i knew this was based on a true story, through the whole movie i was saying to myself: ""even the biggest idiot on the world would never do that""... its awful, no one knows to act, especially when they are on drugs, and the conversations... . I saw movies which had nothing to do with drugs, but the scenes with drugs are a hundred times more convincing... they are telling everyone that they killed bobby, WTF? and the scene on the beach, that hit-man was just talking non sense...as soon as the killing was done, they all started blaming the others... that was bound to happen, but we are not given a reason why it happened then..",Bully

207,tm61,sh*t sandwich,2,30 September 2006,"How can you make a realistic,gritty film about a group of outcast drug taking misfit teenagers? Get a bunch of models to play them obviously! I found myself laughing at this film on several occasions including the acting of the lead role of Marty with his pouty ""i'm so messed up"" looks. In my opinion the only good point that this film raises is that of how the teenagers in the real story it is based on could be so flippant and not understanding what so ever the consequences of their actions. One of the answers the film seem to offer to this is that they do a lot of drugs (well pot which can't really be considered a drug) and acid which isn't exactly a sign of being depraved either. Another is that it's in the culture around them of hip hop (and there's nothing that i hate more than watching rich white Americans thinking that they are ""gangster""). In the real life case Bobby (the bully) was apparently forcing Marty to have sex with him which is a much more feasible reason for murder. The ""mafia hit-man"" who aids them in the murder was another laughing point. Played by the gangly nerd from Kids, he's the most un convincing psycho/hardman in film history.The stupidity of this film is summed up by the fat kid who wonders if there's some sort of ""fine print"" that incriminates people for being at the scene of a crime and not reporting it. Idiots. Overall I truly do like the premise of the film and want to read the book however the story is wasted by awful casting and poor character development, I don't know how anyone could claim that this film is too ""real"" for some people, real compared with mainstream Hollywood maybe, wannabe shock factor otherwise.",Bully
208,jodies,gratuitous nudity,5,9 October 2006,"This movie is an excuse for the director to show young kids get naked and have sex. the sex scenes go on too long and the nudity is unnecessary at times like watching Rachel Miner pee while naked. It was almost like watching kiddie porn. If it wasn't based on a true story, this movie would have been pathetic. Also, the characters are borderline crazy. Especially Rachel Miner's character. I do not know how much of this movie was accurate, but I am sick of watching Bisou Phillips get naked for the hell of it because she is so in love with herself. She wears a bikini top to school that doesn't really fit her. That is so unrealistic! Further, the director did not go into enough detail about why the Bully was so bad to everyone enough to be killed. All we hear is the kids talking about what he did but it is rarely shown. That is why the movie was so terrible other than the gratuitous nudity.",Bully

The movie was basically a dozen sex scenes, a murder, and the tragic downfall of all the characters. I know the director was trying the portray the 'confused' teen with all the drugs and sex, but I felt like I was watching A soft core porn with Shannon Tweed. The most appalling fact of the movie to me was its length. This movie was over two hours, and I feel like an hour of the movie took place in a car. Some people complemented the acting in this movie. Did anyone notice the hit-man? If it wasn't a true story, a would insult the plot. I feel like the movie was based on shock value, and trying to inflect sympathy for a group of bad people. I felt like this movie was entertaining simply for the fact that it was one of those really bad movies you laugh at with your friends.

I saw it in good faith, foolishly believing the critics who poured out their praise. Imagine my shock then when I witnessed possibly the most offensive and worthless creation I have ever seen. The problems I have with 'Bully' and Larry Clark are almost endless, and I will not mention everything here. The characters are vile, and there is nothing there to make you care in the slightest about them. The plot is weak and the script corny and pathetic. The main problem I have with the movie, however, is the apparent perversion of director Clark. Seemingly Clark is the definition of ""dirty old man"", as he has his young actresses nude whenever possible. Almost every scene involves nudity in some form or another. I'm sure Clark will claim he is making a statement about the repetitive and pointless lives of Suburban teenagers, but that seemingly is his excuse to be a pervert. PLEASE do not see this movie! I dont know how I can put my disgust into words any more plainly. DO NOT SEE THIS!",Bully

The realistic plot-line and a good cast made this movie enjoyable.  The true story, however, differs from the movie. In real life Bobby Kent was supposedly in a gang, he and Marty hadn't been as close as the movie portrayed, and there was no latent homosexual tendencies from Bobby. The movie, on the other hand, seemed to convey Bobby as a closet homosexual (watching gay porn while he had sex with females), that he and Marty had been friends forever, and that the only ""gang"" tie was from ""The Hitman"". All said and done, the movie made for great watching, and I highly recommend it.",Bully
217,imani_rah,More Smut From Clark,2,13 October 2007,"When I first entered the unsanitary and perverse mind of Larry Clark, I was watching ""Kids"" with a group of friends. A number of those friends, who'd already seen the flick, communicated to me that the film was ""powerful"" because it painted a bleak picture of America's youth. Upon completion of that overrated, simplistic film, however, I felt dirty. I felt as if I'd entered the world of child pornography, but hadn't made the final descent because the film itself wasn't X-rated. Though I wanted to trash the film and Clark's direction, I bit my tongue and gave the movie a pass, thinking it was possibly the subject matter that sickened me and not Larry Clark. After watching and being totally offended by 2001's ""Bully,"" though, I will no longer give Mr. Clark the benefit of the doubt. In my humble estimation, he is a smut peddler whose twisted vision of American teens is both reprehensible and inaccurate. While some have given him much more credit than he deserves on the grounds that he makes us acknowledge our failures as parents, I find his work to be very average. And the fact that he's so preoccupied with capturing these nude or semi-nude images of teens diminishes his work even further.There is nothing exceptional about this movie. The circumstances surrounding the murder of Nick Stahl's character provide the only interesting angle, and Larry Clark deserves no credit for that, as the film is based on true events. He takes us to places we've already been, shows us behavior we've already seen, and expects us to not see through his transparent material. There is no depth to the characters, and Clark does little to provide energy for the struggling cast. If you like watching smut, ""Bully"" won't disappoint.",Bully
218,josefroe,Larry Clarke at his Best!,10,14 June 2002,"I have heard some critics say that Larry Clarke is somewhat bizarre for his extreme interest in teenage sex, drugs and violence. Some would even say he was a pervert. But Larry Clarke is probably one of the best film makers that America has produced. Next to David Fincher, Larry CLarkes ability to shock and invoke make his films classics of our times. Kids was superb, but Bully, I think, was his pinnacle.As a budding film maker I take Larry Clarke as my guru. His realism and his 'dont give a f**k' attitude to makeing films makes my beg for more. I can not begint o express my amazement at his brilliance.Brad Renfro was perfect in his role as Marty. I think Renfro is a talented actor and has done well brakeing out from his child roles. Picking Larry CLarke was probably the turning point in his career.The film was dark and real, and you could relate, or well I could relate to all opf the charactors, watching their existance unfold up until the point of no return...well, words could not describe how orestruck I was. The opening line just set the scene for what has, in my mind, become the best film of the 20th century.And throughout the darkness, Larry CLarke still finds time to entertain, with the supurb Donny. Michael Pitt, who Id never seen before made me fall in love. A suberb charactor.I think Larry Clarke should be made ruler of the world, and I hope to see many more hard hitting real films like Bully.Brilliant film...well done to all.",Bully
219,FINdaddy,The true story of high school revenge made into a great film.,10,15 July 2002,"Bully is one of the most overlooked movies of all time. Director Larry Clark has created a masterpiece that far surpasses his previous work on films like 'Kids' and 'Another Day in Paradise'.  Based on the true story of a group of suburban teens who take justice into their own hands against a neighborhood bully, the film depicts the true lives of teens growing up in America, and how parents truly do not know what their children are capable of. Performances are superb for both Brad Renfro and Bijou Philips. The film was not given the publicity it deserves, probably because of the negative pubilicity given to Clark's previous work 'Kids', because of the upset parents who did not want to believe that teens truly behaved this way. For those people, don't watch 'Bully'. You will be in for even more of a shock.",Bully

I haven't been able to read the book, so I cannot compare the two.. but I felt that the story was portrayed well.  The characters really stood out to me.. on one hand I can relate to them, being their age myself.  Though it's a bit startling how easily a group of semi-normal people (protagonist and antagonist aside) can be swayed to commit a murder in cold blood.The heavy subject matter, graphic depiction of the act, and abrupt ending kind of left me unsure of my thoughts on the movie.. but now that i've had time to sleep on it and reflect, I think it was done very well, and given some time i'm sure to come back to it.",Bully
221,xpyral,are we being provoked yet?,3,23 September 2002,"kids was good. bully, on the other hand, is not.it would seem like the director thinks he has found a success recipe for film making, provocation, and does his best to do just this. the result is a movie about teenagers taking drugs, having sex, taking more drugs, having gay sex, rape, murder.. oh, yeah, and harsh language.Since the movie is ""based on a true story"", unbelievable is better (apparently). Well, I would disagree. At times Mr Clark tries so hard to provoke, it (almost)is hilarious. All in all the film remains as a pointless struggling piece where the main focus is PROVOCATION.some of the actors are ""good to be kids"". Don't bother. Go see ""Lilja 4 Ever"" instead.",Bully

Having read the book several years ago, the direction was stunning and he really shared their stories in an honest and upfront manner. Disturbing to watch this film, yet the manner in which it was filmed makes you question who was truly guilty. It is unfortunate that the aftermath wasn't as well documented in the film; that is a complete another film I imagine.

223,jpenney6,a film that changed my opinion on Larry Clark,9,2 October 2008,"When i first saw Clarks' Kids, i was highly disappointed, in fact i can safely say i was quite disgusted. The entire film just seemed to over emphasise and exaggerate the lives of kids in the particular area. I thought Clarks dodgy camera work, and disturbing obsession with the male body and teen sexuality was grotesque. I was then forced to view Bully, and expected the same, and in all fairness, i got exactly the same in many ways. However, this film really grabbed my attention. I had to watch it twice, because again, upon first viewing i despised it. The second time i learnt to appreciate the work of whom i now consider to be a great realist director, approaching and addressing subjects that many other directors wouldn't go near for fear of rejection. The story, based on true events (though the post script mentions its possible dramatisation) was thorough, nothing left to question. And again, like Leo Fitzpatrick in Kids (who also features in Bully), the casting was immaculate. Brad Renfro i believe could've had a huge impact on the film world if it wasn't for his untimely death, and his performance was simply outstanding, as were the rest of the cast. If, like me, you didn't like the work of Larry Clark before, but have not had the chance or motivation to see Bully, i strongly advise you do, and like me i am sure you wont be disappointed!",Bully
224,batomm113,Incredible!,10,10 December 2002,"This is an incredible movie!  If the movie were not based on real life events then it would not be as thrilling.  It would simply be another teen movie among many.  Nick Stahl portrays Bobby Kent with intensity and fire. He really brings a lot to the role and will probably be one of the next big young actors out there considering he will be John Connor in Terminator 3. Brad Renfro gives his best performance to date.  Lately all the publicity around him is about his off-screen exploits but one should look at this performance before they judge any of his future films on what goes on in his personal life.  Everyone in the film gives a great performance but it is carried by Stahl because everyone is waiting to see what he will do next. Anyone who says that the movie is dumb and not true to life because the kids in it were unbelievable and dumb should realize that this really happened in Florida in 1993.  Bobby Kent was a real person and now he is dead at the hands of his ""best friend"".  I think Larry Clark did a wonderful job bringing to life a story that should be told because of it's unflinching take on one of the most horrific murders of modern time.  It does not glorify the murder but rather tell the tale.",Bully
225,FlickChick8615,Pretty good movie. . .,9,24 January 2003,"First of all, I think Larry Clark is a brilliant director. I found Kids to be an amazing film, showing the shockingly true face of reality that a lot of teens deal with on a daily basis. And this was another movie that was very realistic as well. That's why I admire Larry Clark as a director, he takes a very realistic approach at all of his films.I thought Brad Renfro did a fabulous job as the emotionally damaged best friend of Nick Stahl, who played the villain of the movie, thus the title ""Bully."" Brad showed his undying bravery as he willingly killed his best friend in a heart-broken rage of revenge for all the awful things he had done to him, his girlfriend, & his other friends as well. I don't ever think I've seen such a great performance from Renfro.Overall, I found the movie to be very intense, but quite depressing as well. It's one of those movies that hits you in the face like a brick because it's so real. I really enjoyed it though. Makes you think a lot.",Bully

I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand. I shouldn't have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt Clark's worst film There is so much wrong with this film. First off, some of the acting is great, in particular Nick Stahl as 'The Bully', and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can't recall her name), but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He's a veteran of Clark's films now and he was so brilliant in 'Kids', but in 'Bully' he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually. The screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student. No sorry, a high school student...one who has never seen a movie before. And I couldn't fathom Clark's intentions. Was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids' existence? It sure as hell didn't stop him getting in a damn good perv. I'm no prude but I didn't need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still maintain that Clark's best film is 'Another Day in Paradise'.

Every other scene involves some kind of sex or revealing pose, and there is not much a coherent plot to go along with it.  Secondly, the movie would have benefited if the leading actors' roles had been reversed; i.e., the actor who played Nick would have been better suited to play the role of Marty, and vice versa.  Also, whether or not the movie was BASED on a true story, the plot was completely unbelievable, and the actress who played Marty's girlfriend is neither believable nor frightening.  All of her attempts at seeming either of these come off as cheesy and actually kind of pathetic.  The only thing good about this movie would have to be Leo Fitzpatrick, the hit man, who is awesome (see Kids, Storytelling).  Even though he has a small part, he is pretty good.  The biggest problem with this movie is that it has nothing else to go with its raunchiness.  It simply tries to shock the audience, which is not enough to justify wasting 90 minutes on it.",Bully
229,omair-metalhead,An excellent teenage psychological drama that is gripping throughout,8,27 November 2014,"This is one of those films whereby you initially force yourself to watch it just for the sake of viewing just another part of the wider reality. Even though none of the characters have any charm about them, one feels attached to them because they are only misguided teenagers. The director has done an incredible job. What I really appreciated was that how this turned out to be one of those specifically psychological drama that is gripping throughout and you feel tensed throughout as well, and at parts even consider not finding out what happens next. Perhaps because Bobby portrayed the most hateable character whose murder you actually affirm (highly justifiable morally), and the thought of Marty and Lisa getting caught is something you hope against. The ending is very climatic with the perfect soundtrack. I love how the director captures teenage paranoia so well, something I have observed in only a few films. The acting is incredible, especially of Dornie! Also, for me, this film strengthened my stand against capitol punishment. Marty's subjection to the electric chair was the last thing you would hope for.",Bully

Despite being based on a true story, the horribly out-of touch writing makes the characters and their motives unbelelievable. There are also many unnecessary crotch-shots of the under-age looking actresses, which I found more disturbing than the movie itself. I think as far as cinema goes, the director Larry Clark has said all he needed to say. His whole point seems to be to leave a bad taste in your mouth and while perhaps that needed to be said with 'Kids', it's not something that needs to be said over and over again. To be honest I was not a big fan of 'Kids' but as tasteless as that movie was, it at least had some shock value. 'Bully' is just plain dull. Now whats on the other channels?",Bully

They seemed to be ""winging it"", in some of the script this gives it a authentic, ""yeah i would probably say that too"" feel.I to have seen KIDS, and felt that was an accurate portrayal of a certain type of teenager. The characters in BULLY, are mirroring what is happening to some in this age group, with the blank stare and the rolling of the eyes. The director allows the actors some range in the ""slack"" look, the feet shuffling and the personal dramas.The sex and drug use may be a ""tad"" over the top but do not take away from the story. The main event is probably one of the most accurate betrayals of murder brought to film. I can assure you people not getting their stories together, helps people in my line of work immeasurably!I think that this is the selling point of the film for me, how this flawed from the start plan becomes an even bigger nightmare after the event. The characters turning on each other and ""confiding in FRIENDS"" to ease their minds, is cannon fodder,for the investigator. Turning suspects like this is almost too easy, funny if it was not so tragic! The director and whoever wrote the screenplay definitely got it right.",Bully

Did it REALLY need to show all those realistic sex scenes? And don't you think that the violence was a little unnecessary? If this is what you think, then Larry Clark really did succeed. If you have seen Gummo, or Kids, you'll understand that Larry Clark strikes where it hurts most; the young people in our society and their lifestyle and habits. Every character in the movie was so well portrayed, so true to the story (well, as far as I know) and shocked us and made us wonder about our young people.

They don't make much of an effort to stop Bobby until one day they decide to murder him. Bullying is a huge problem around the world today and this movie shows the high level of emotions one can obtain from being bullied. Stand up for yourself but also make the right decisions.

236,a-sundaralingam,Poor direction,4,5 January 2006,"This film left me very unimpressed, it really had the making of a great film. The only thing that made this film remotely interesting was the fact that it was based on true events. The main criticism I have is that there was absolutely no character development, I was left wondering why the characters all did what they did. Why was Bobby such a dick? There was a half hearted explanation, his relationship with his dad, but is it me or was his dad just behaving like normal dads, hell all he wanted was for his son to be successful. They cast Brad Renfro for the role of Martin and he really doesn't fit the part for me, I mean he's physically much bigger than Nick Stahl so why did he put up with all the bullshit? Than there's the 'Hitman' would it have killed them to at least explain what was going on with this guy, since he clearly had issues, pretending to be a gangster? And what about Aly why was she as messed up as she was?None of these kids suddenly became the way they were and it would have made for a better film if it had explored this aspect. The actors didn't do a bad job especially when the kids were altogether before and after the kill, they managed some very realistic performances. When looking back at it now, I can imagine that's just how the kids reacted in real life.Larry Clark really ruined this movie for me, his lingering shots of prepubescent boys half naked, drinking and smoking just left me thinking he has issues of his own! The man just can not direct, for instance look at all the parents of the children they are the most brain dead people you could ever meet.Even if the movie was based on true events, its portrayal is so poor that I found it unbelievable. Based on the film, I didn't think Bobby was so bad, I thought the other kids were more f***** up than him.",Bully

Does it show how far youngster have lost the feeling for what is reality, how much their respect for humans has shrunk by sitting in front of computers and watching the colorful entertainment world at TV? No way, the film has a bit of everything in it and he does his job well.The youngster move in this cinematic world without any rules and it seems like a experimental world without moral, without a beginning and an ending. The days we may share with the characters seem almost timeless. Their decisions and statements are thoughtless. They don't have any confirmed opinions, they act in a terrifying way of naive unscrupulousness. They don't have any duties. Modern America can't provide them any challenges so their constructive energy is used destruction. They lack of the natural proportion between social behavior and the consequences of such behavior. We all have this feeling and we can all be just by treating our fellow men. Their only answer for bad behavior is killing. The film shows: The emotional cripples our society has created will take revenge - if they want to or not.",Bully
238,trentvdw,Rubbish,1,8 August 2005,"Larry Clarke's 'Bully' lazily documents the drug-taking, quick-f**king existence of several desperately boring teenagers who decide to kill a friend who is, wait for it, a bully. The only bully encountered watching this miserable film though is Clarke. His sad and insistent preoccupation with throwing screen time at the bodies of pubescent girls, at the expense of both plot and character development is misery inducing. To believe, as is expected, that these characters were bored enough, or passionate enough, to involve themselves in a murder is to gift this film dues it doesn't deserve. Incredibly, Clarke had the assistance of an existing novel, complete with back stories of the characters depicted in what is a true story, and yet he has managed to create a film with a structure devoid of intention or focus. Rather, this is an insipid, exploitative, and genuinely dull experience. It displays cringe-inducing lead performances, from inexperienced and largely miss-cast actors who suffer badly from Clarke's failings as a director. Jarring lines, ridiculously unconvincing mood swings and flat interactions are the staple here. An incongruous musical treatment binds this horror of a film together appropriately enough. If you watch this film on DVD though, the best insight into the passion and storytelling abilities of Clarke are given us by Clarke himself, in an interview which is undoubtedly the comic highlight of this viewing experience.",Bully
239,thecollins02,Oh so so bad,1,20 October 2005,"O.K., This one goes into my Bad Flick Hall of Fame. It was one of those films that was so ridiculously bad that you can't take your eyes off of it. You just have to see if it possibly can get any worse. And, may I say, there is something very ""ICK!"" about looking at constant nudity of girls who are supposed to be portraying high school aged teenagers.It's obvious that this screenplay was written (if written at all) from the different stories of the various characters. I say this because the continuity of the stories, and the points of view in different scenes taking place in the same approximate time are so vastly different. It's either that or the director is Bipolar. Take your pick.Definitely a stinker. I'd sit through a couple of showings of Ishtar before I'd watch this turkey again.",Bully
240,prince2311,Worst film ever,1,19 February 2006,"After finding himself at the constant abuse of his best friend Bobby, Marty has become fed up with his friend's twisted ways. His girlfriend, a victim of Bobby's often cruel ways, couldn't agree more and they strategize murdering Bobby, with a group of willing and unwilling participants in a small Florida town. In the midst of their plotting, they find themselves contemplating with the possible aftermath of what could happen.The story is simple, You Have Marty and Bobby, Bobby is not a nice guy, he is constantly abusing Marty, both in physical abuse and in physiology i.e pimping Marty out at a gay bar is nothing more than a thrilling chance to grab some cash for Bobby despite how uncomfortable Marty feels with this. However when Bobby turns his unwanted attention to Lisa, Marty's New Girlfriend, and her friend Ali, Lisa decides she has had enough of Bobby's wicked ways. So what are Marty and Lisa to do?? Well they plan to kill him.With the help of a few other brain dead teens and a so called ""Hit-man"", who can't be much of a Hit-man if he uses Kids no older than 9 and 13 for his crime ring, the group plot out to murder Bobby. The interesting thing about the group and the inner dynamics of the group is that there is no leader, these kids are alienated, high school drop-outs. The plan happens so fast that there is no thought behind the murder, this is where BULLY calls the bluff of all those other films that claim to deal with bored and alienated teenagers. These Kids are literally Brain Dead, they are the dumbest of there generation and in some strange way it makes for an interesting story Its Bleak, Dark, Depressive, and Strangely Sometimes the Dialogue comes across as unintentionally humorous in a dark way. Soaked in shots of naked teens, violent sex and behavior for the first half which set up our motives , while the second half deals a lot with such as stress, realization of what they have done, and the compulsion to tell everyone about what they did. The film captures everything i loved about the book in a perfected way",Bully
241,colleen_71286,Great acting...A haunting movie that stays with you,9,17 November 2005,"I watched this movie five days ago and I'm still affected by it. Afterwards all I could do was cry for the youth of America, because this isn't just some movie. It really, truly happened. The actors turn in outstanding performances as teenagers with nothing to do but turn to sex and drugs to fill the empty voids in their lives. Nick Stahl is particularly amazing as Bobby, the boarder-line psychotic who tormented his friends until they could take it no more.This is a sad, realistic look at how many teenagers really do act with their peers. Don't look for your typical teenager fare here because you won't find it. The language, sex, and drug use may bother some people, but thats because no one wants to believe that young adults can be this way. Well, I got out of high school two years ago and I can tell you that this is not far from reality. Thats probably why it has affected me so much...because I know that stuff portrayed in this movie really does happen. This is a great movie. Watch it. Then go tell your kids you love them.",Bully
242,donatelloluver,Fun to watch. At times unrealistic and ridiculous.,7,29 July 2006,"It's an alright movie. Nothing great. I think the storyline is alittle bit bumpy and at times off-road. The ""bully"" character is maybe too mean. I don't think anyone would actually put up with this kid but what do I know. There's lots of sex and nudity all the time. I'd say there's enough sex scenes to consider it a porn with a considerable storyline and tolerable acting. There are some good quotes in the movie and it is sometimes funny. Some of the lines are delivered very poorly though. It reminded me of Degrassi acting. Oh yeah, you have to put up with lots of rap music throughout the movie. It's worth watching once as long as you have someone there with you to make fun of it. Or if you're really serious you'll probably like it.",Bully
243,delicatesounds,Question on Bobby and Rachel,8,12 November 2009,"Question to those that have seen the movie. I found it very peculiar that the movie, which is already filled with lots of teenage sex, did not clarify what exactly happened between Bobby and Rachel. There is a scene where Bobby watches Rachel closely as she is having sex with Marty, and then another one where he walks in on Marty and Rachel having sex, shoves her off of Marty and cries ""next"", but the movie is unclear what happens next (does he have sex with her? with him? leaves?). The hint is, that when Rachel realizes she is pregnant, she think it may be Bobby. But what I don't understand is why the director leave that unclear? There is so much sex, some of it quite violent, that it is bizarre that such a central issue (as it is Rachel that really wants him dead) is not clarified. Thanks for any responses on this point.",Bully
