0,MartinHafer,Well worth seeing...but I'd sure love to see a follow-up,9,27 August 2013,"I am not British nor am I Irish. And, as far as 'the troubles' go, I don't have a very strong opinion one way or another. A lot of crazy stuff went on for so long and there's so much guilt, it's hard to take a side--though I sure hate the idea of terrorism. So, I am not a person with a dog in the fight, so to speak. I just thought I'd mention this so you don't think I had a particular stake in the film.The film is the story of Gerry Conlon, though it also affected his father, the rest of his family and some friends. Back during the heyday of IRA terrorism in the 1970s, the British were obviously very frustrated and were willing to go to some extreme methods to stop it--even if it meant suspending traditional constitutional rights. This is understandable but troubling. But what goes WAY beyond troubling were the methods used by the prosecutors and police to convict a group of people for a bombing--even when it turned out that they knew that the people were probably innocent! The film is essentially a showcase for Daniel Day-Lewis to show off his acting skills. However, the film also had lovely direction and was a first-class project all around. Well worth seeing--and there's a good chance this film might make you feel a little mad.",In the Name of the Father
1,TheLittleSongbird,Very moving and exceptionally well acted,9,27 January 2011,"In the Name of the Father... what a fine movie! This is a movie that really moved me and continues to do so. It has a stirring story, that carries a great dramatic punch, it is beautifully directed by Jim Sheridan and while a little over two hours it never bored me. The script is lovingly balanced, the film looks beautiful and the emotional punch is definitely there. I loved the acting best of all though. Daniel Day Lewis is highly impressive as Conlon, and while I have seen a few reviews saying Emma Thompson was miscast I thought her performance was fine, if anything I would have liked to have seen more of her. For me, Pete Postlethwaite gives the best performance, he is brilliant as the bemused and hapless father, and if there is a film or role he should be remembered for it is this one. Overall, a perhaps controversial but engaging, moving and wonderfully acted movie. 9/10 Bethany Cox",In the Name of the Father
2,SnoopyStyle,Incredible father and son story,8,16 December 2014,"It's 1974. The IRA bombs a pub in Guildford, England. Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) is an aimless petty thief. His father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite) is a straight-arrow soft-spoken man. He and his friend Paul Hill (John Lynch) are in London staying with hippies. They leave the flat when the pub bombing happens. A prostitute drops her keys and Gerry breaks in. The parliament passes the Prevention of Terrorism Act which allows for suspects to be held for 7 days. Gerry, Paul and others are arrested and coerced into false confessions. Giuseppe and other relatives are also implicated. The actual bomber Joe McAndrew (Don Baker) is arrested and tells the police. However the police refuses to admit its mistake. Gerry befriends Joe in prison while ignoring the peaceful faith of his father. Joe becomes the leader of the prison as Giuseppe declines in health. British attorney Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson) works to free the falsely imprisoned. After Joe burns the lead guard, Gerry saves him and turns on Joe.This is a meticulous telling of a compelling life wrongly convicted. It's a bit up and down at times. The first trial is not the most compelling. The results are preordained and not that compelling. The most compelling is the father son relationship. When Joe get into the middle, it's a great turn in the story. These are two great performances from Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite. The two of them in prison is a terrific movie filled with emotions and character growth. The final court case is theatrical as heck.",In the Name of the Father
3,Hitchcoc,Superb Acting and an Outstanding Story,10,29 December 2010,"What is so sad is that while some of the true events were played with, for the most part, this sad episode in British history actually took place. The issue of Northern Ireland has spawned numerous portrayals, some of them outstanding movies. This is about a man who is a bit of a buffoon and a free spirit who acts foolishly (unfortunately, he is unaware that his stupidity would be viewed as it it), and gets into big trouble. Not just going to prison himself but dragging in his entire family. New laws allowed a group of overzealous police to take the rights of a ""free"" people into their own hands. It's a bit like the Homeland Security act today. It was easy to torture, frighten, and taunt people into giving up everything. This included threatening to kill a good friend or even your father. This is a black eye. I never felt the IRA had a right to do what they did, but one can see how their hatred was hatched. Add to this the incredible performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and his cohorts and you have a superb film. See this one.",In the Name of the Father
4,classicsoncall,"""...if there's one thing I know about, it's guilt, you know?""",8,13 November 2017,"This is a dramatically moving story on film, but as is so often the case, mincemeat is made of the historical facts so if that's what you're looking for you'll be disappointed. Other reviewers have done a good job of establishing the real relationships involved between Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Paul Hill (John Lynch), so no use belaboring that point. The most disturbing aspect of this film is the idea that authorities won't admit their mistake in a high profile case, even when it means the disruption of families and it's impact on vulnerable citizens like Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), who died in prison serving out a senseless term for a crime he didn't commit. Adding insult to injury, the real terrorists, some of whom admitted their part in the Guildford pub bombing, never even got charged with the crime. It's just so infuriating, especially when you know there's no recourse for the injured parties. With all that, the thing that caused my biggest sit up and take notice moment occurred during the credits following the movie, when it was noted that Paul Hill eventually wound up marrying the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy. He and Courtney Kennedy wed in 2002 and lived in Ireland for four years until they legally separated.",In the Name of the Father
5,gavin6942,History and Court Drama,8,9 April 2015,"A man (Daniel Day-Lewis)'s coerced confession to an IRA bombing he did not commit results in the imprisonment of his father as well. An English lawyer fights to free them.This film is a great combination of history and court drama. Sometimes both mix very nicely (as with the Nuremberg trial) and sometimes they do not. Here, we get a nice glimpse at the IRA in Ireland without dwelling on it too much and also get the true story of a family that was wronged by the state for their alleged involvement in terror.Ireland today is not the same place it was a generation ago, but it is not so far removed that this story is ""distant history"" and not important. Heck, Americans should probably know more about it than what they pick up from a U2 song.",In the Name of the Father
6,lee_eisenberg,so much for civilized England,10,6 February 2006,"We Americans often like to think of England as the most civilized place on Earth. ""In the Name of the Father"" shows that this is unfortunately not true. It's the true story of Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis), a rowdy Northern Irishman who got imprisoned by the British government for a crime that he didn't commit. Specifically, they tortured him to the point that he signed a confession. So, he was sent to jail with some other Northern Irish people - including his father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite) - and forced to experience fifteen years of brutality from every angle.This is one of those movies that cuts right to the heart of a touchy issue. Regardless of which opinion you take of the situation in Northern Ireland, this is a movie that everyone should see, just to understand the cruel lengths to which governments can go when they think that they're right. I've heard Daniel Day-Lewis described as the world's most devoted actor; ""In the Name of the Father"" certainly backs that up, and I would definitely say that this is Jim Sheridan's best movie ever.",In the Name of the Father
7,jboothmillard,In the Name of the Father,7,20 June 2010,"From Oscar nominated director Jim Sheridan (My Left Foot), I only discovered while watching what the theme was, but the leading star was the hook for me. Based on the true story, from the autobiographical book by the leading character called ""Proved Innocent"", Gerry Conlon (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Day-Lewis) is a small time crook living in Belfast, Ireland. After a IRA bombing of a pub killing several people in London, where Gerry is, he and four of his friends, and three other men, all named the ""Maguire Seven"" are made to look like, by the bullying police, to have carried out and confess to the crime. Gerry, his father Giuseppe (Oscar nominated Pete Postlethwaite), known IRA member Joe McAndrew (Don Baker) and the other four are falsely imprisoned for a sentence of fifteen years. Knowing their innocence, they are not all keen on prison life, so they start appealing for a case to prove themselves, with the help of compassionate British attorney Gareth Peirce (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Emma Thompson). Trying to help Gerry, who has recently lost his father in the prison cells, Gareth has to get through to the leader of the investigation, Robert Dixon (Corin Redgrave), in order to get a case going. It is when covered up evidence appears that Gareth truly knows she has a chance to win the case and clear Gerry, his late father, and the others' names, and she does. Also starring Sliding Doors' John Lynch as Paul Hill, Mark Sheppard as Paddy Armstrong, Beatie Edney as Carole Richardson, Marie Jones as Sarah Conlon, Britta Smith as Annie Maguire, Father Ted's Gerald McSorley as Detective Pavis, Saffron Burrows as Girl in Commune, Johnny English director Peter Howitt as Remand Prison Officer and The Full Monty's Tom Wilkinson as Appeal Prosecutor. I'm afraid to say, that in certain moments, I agree with the critics that Thompson is miscast for her role, she may have some okay moments worthy of an Oscar nomination, but ultimately she just feels wrong. Anyway, Day-Lewis is a really good choice for the lead protagonist, Postlethwaite does very well as well, and I suppose it is a biographical drama that should be seen, at least once in my opinion. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Song for ""(You Made Me The) Thief of Your Heart"". Very good!",In the Name of the Father
8,ccthemovieman-1,"An Involving, Sometimes Brutal Story",6,10 October 2006,"I might have rated this higher had Emma Thompson had a bigger role. I am a fan of hers, plus I think most people would agree she's an excellent actress, so it was disappointment to see her appear much until the last 15 minutes of the film. That's especially misleading when she gets second or third billing in this movie.Nonetheless, it's an involving true-story of an Irishman, his dad and some of their relatives who are all sent to prison for a bombing they had nothing to do with. Filmmakers LOVE these kind of stories in which they can make their country and police into the bad guys. Here, the British look bad - very bad - as they railroad ""Gerry Conlon"" (Daniel-Day Lewis). The latter makes a convincing hot-headed Irishman, but he's no killer. The tone of the movie softens not in the last half hour as Lewis' character begins to appreciate his father. Until then, it's a rough film that is not always easy to watch and hear because of the accents, some police brutality and corruptness and general group of nasty characters.By the way, despite the billing, Pete Postlewaite is the second star of the film. He doesn't get the recognition he deserves for his acting contribution in this movie.",In the Name of the Father
9,rmax304823,Original Sin,6,4 December 2007,"Daniel Day-Lewis is Gerry Conlon, a Belfast Catholic. He's a young guy who leads a reckless life, throwing rocks gleefully at British armored cars, stealing from a prostitute's apartment. But things are getting rough in Belfast. A resolution has just been passed that allows for the arrest and retention of suspected terrorists for seven days without charge. (Seven days, nothing. How about infinity? Betrayed by neighboring and competitive falafel-stand owner, the despicable and damned-forever Shaymala, who is forever after me. May her tribe be cursed. Signed: Abdul Abulbul Amir, Guantanamo.) Well, Day-Lewis ships over to London where he leads a reckless, heedless, drug- and booze-besotted, frolicsome, life of hippiedom in a shoddy commune of like-minded dope-smoking friends. We don't believe in eating animals. Only love.The next thing he knows, he's in the slams with his father. He's been convicted of setting off a bomb in a pub, and his Da of running a safe house.The scene in which the explosion occurs is very well done. Here is the happy, fur-bedecked Day-Lewis in the equivalent of Central Park or Golden Gate Park, having his usual unthinking good time, when there comes to the gay group a distant but loud THUMP. They rise and look grimly in the direction of the sound. ""Sounds like Belfast,"" says one of them.It would have been easy to make the Crown the heavy and the poor IRA folk the awesome victims, but that's not what this is about. It's about the relationship between Day-Lewis, a delinquent, and his father, Pete Postelthwaite, who committed sins a long time ago.Inmates have an interesting subculture. And it's different, evidently, from one country to another. These inmates are almost benign compared to Americans. American inmates have ritual verbalisms that excuse their acts -- murder or whatever. ""It wasn't personal."" (Probably taken from ""The Godfather."") Or, ""He had no business being there."" American cops have the same convention: ""It was just a natural act,"" said when a police officer shoots or beats the crap out of a bystander. No problem. If one inmate has a fit and falls down an iron staircase, another inmate who witnesses it might -- might -- call the center and say, ""Somebody just fell down,"" without helping. And the slams themselves are better kept up in Britain than in all but the newest slams in America. The direction is zippy without being maddening, and the acting superb. It's well worth seeing.",In the Name of the Father
10,Quinoa1984,"a son, a father, and the damning of the Irish (or any damned group)",9,1 June 2015,"In the movie In the Name of the Father, we get a story involving injustice - people who are accused and found guilty of crimes they didn't commit - but why it works is centrally two things: even if you don't know a thing about the IRA (though it might help to know just a little) or the struggles in Belfast in the 1970's and how it involved the United Kingdom, people see injustice happening every day, with many races. If one were to put this on a double bill with the Burns doc The Central Park Five, the coincidences would be extraordinary: the rampant torture via police to the accused, the lack of any strong legal defense, and the tampering of evidence. There is that aspect, the US against THEM element, which is simple enough. But trickier, and what works greater, is the father son element of the story, where Daniel Day Lewis is Gerry Conlon is in prison for life along with his father (a very innocent man) Giuseppe, who is there for the simple reason of accused corroboration.In a way it's probably the most accessible film that has been made, that I can think of off the top of my head, about the controversies and ""war"" of the IRA over the years. I don't see Sheridan taking sides either way exactly with the IRA except for the fact of the killing innocent people, those ""innocent bystanders"" that die in that pub bombing, is very wrong. The context and framing of it is what counts; Conlon had no real political aspirations either way, and when we first see him, he's basically a young punk/hippie who gets chased by IRA guards as they think his stick is a sniper. He goes to London to cool off/find work/hang low, and it's actually in the scene where he first is going off - by the ship - that he and his father have the interaction that speaks to what will come: Giuseppe is a natural, loving father, maybe at worst a little awkward or 'normal', while Gerry is just a young, aimless youth, uncomfortable with any affection or care.The crime and arrest happen due to the sort of circumstances that happens with Wrong Man scenarios (not the Hitchcock sort, to be sure). The Wrong-Place-Wrong-Time thing, and it leads one of the most harrowing section of the film, where Conlon is interrogated. Day-Lewis here is explosive, charged, frightened, crying, under mental and physical abuse, but yet he keeps it all in check. Another actor might have gone over the top here, but somehow it always feels just right, calibrated even in the highly charged emotional range. Then he and the others are found guilty (oh darn that homeless alibi!) and sent off to prison.Apparently, according to Ebert's review, some facts were shuffled around to add to the drama - namely that the Conlon father/son shared a cell. Perhaps it is convenient dramatically speaking, and there's even a period in these years they're in there together, that Gerry spends less time with his dad, trying to escape through drugs and other (somehow friendly) prisoners. If there's one issue with this mid-section involving prison, it's that most everyone - with the exception perhaps until the other Irish man (no spoilers here) comes to prison - gets along and there's no real horror to go through. Maybe that's kind of refreshing in a sense, usually prison is shown in movies as a very rough place. If anything the political situation - the Conlons being innocent - makes it the most frenetic and harried for Gerry and his father.But, again, it's the tone of this personal side, just showing DDL and Postlethwaite together, that makes the film work so well. We may hope, and see it probably as conventional, that Gerry is set in these injustice-wheels and everything's spinning until he can get help (in the form here of Emma Thompson, in maybe the only one-dimensional role in the film, not that she is poor in any way acting-wise). But deep down, the bond between these two is what counts, and Gerry's own growth as a person is marked as he spends more time behind bars. So In the Name of the Father is successful on the fronts of what the story is about, but also how it's about it via its emotional stakes, especially in the third act when things become uncertain for the decent father. And if anything, as great as Lewis is (and that's a given, of course, look at his track record), Postlethwaite rises up to be his equal. In sort, an acting masters class in what is mostly a heavy film, with a lot of heart and (even once or twice, early on before the s*** goes down) a little light-heartedness.",In the Name of the Father
11,sunwarrior13,One Great Film About Miscarriage Of Justice,10,23 October 2012,"The My Left Foot team of star Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan were reunited to make this political docudrama about Irish citizen Gerry Conlon,who was wrongly convicted of taking part in an IRA bombing that killed five in Guildford, England in 1974 in this movie entitled,In The Name Of The Father.Pete Postlethwaite,John Lynch,Mark Sheppard,Beatie Edney,Emma Thompson and Don Baker co-star to play key supporting roles. The screenplay was adapted by Terry George and Jim Sheridan from the autobiography Proved Innocent: The Story of Gerry Conlon of the Guildford Four by Gerry Conlon.The movie tells the true saga of Gerry Conlon. A petty thief in strife- torn '70s Belfast, Gerry's main interests are getting drunk and partying, much to the dismay of his quiet, frail father Giuseppe. When Gerry angers the IRA, his father sends him to England, where his antics land him in the wrong place at the wrong time. Innocent, but forced to confess to a savage terrorist bombing, he is sentenced to life imprisonment as one of the ""Guildford Four."" An innocent Giuseppe is also arrested and jailed, and while behind bars, Gerry slowly learns that his father's seeming weakness masks an unmatched inner strength and wisdom. Working with a fiercely dedicated lawyer, Gerry determines to prove his innocence, clear his father's name and expose the truth behind one of the most shameful legal events in recent history.Miscarried justice often provides the vehicle for emotionally wrenching drama and histrionic fireworks, and such is the case in spades with In the Name of the Father.The brilliance of Jim Sheridan's motion picture is that we come to view every event from the perspective of how it impacts on the relationship between Gerry and his father, in whose name the final struggle is fought.In addition to that,Letter-perfect performances from Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite that the acting's so good it frequently transcends the simplicity of the script and do a lot more than a dozen editorials to make an unforgettable point about the miscarriage of justice.",In the Name of the Father

13,hitchcockthelegend,Stunningly well told story.,9,4 March 2008,"In 1974 the Irish Republican Army bombed two public houses in Guildford, England-The Horse & Groom and the Seven Stars. 5 people were killed and 65 people were seriously injured. During the wave of public hatred for all things Irish, the police round up Belfast rogue Gerry Conlon and his mate Paul Hill and interrogate for 7 days with brute force to obtain a confession... This is Gerry Conlon & the Guildford 4's story.This is real powerful stuff that thankfully is directed with careful hands. Director Jim Sheridan is equal in his demonizing of the police and the IRA here because it's crucial for us to focus on the Guildford 4. Focus on the Conlon family, for they are victims of injustice when they have no political, or nationalistic affiliations. He centres in on the relationship between Gerry & his father Guiseppe as they find themselves both wrongly imprisoned. It's that family heartbeat that drives this film on, and it's testament to the makers talents that it never comes across as maudlin, it's all very potent and is the films major axis point.Based on a true story the picture has a finale that will not surprise anyone, but come the last reel you feel emotionally drained, you have come thru the mangler, and myself personally felt both joy and anger in equal measure. Containing brilliant performances from Pete Postelthwaite & Daniel Day Lewis as father & son Conlon respectively, In The Name of The Father is a truly great film that demands not only your head, but also your heart. 9/10",In the Name of the Father
14,Theo Robertson,Innocence Is Not An Absolute,7,9 August 2002,"Like MIDNIGHT EXPRESS , IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER is a an extremely well made film , but like MIDNIGHT EXPRESS much of it is total invention . Reviewers on this page have already pointed out the numerous errors such as Guiseppe and Gerry Conlon never being imprisoned in the same jail or the "" Guilford four "" and "" Mcguire seven "" trials taking place in completely seperate court cases but no one seems to have pointed out the erroneous backgrounds this film paints of Gerry Conlon and Paul Hill. In their book THE PROVISIONAL IRA authors Patrick Bishop and Eamon Mallie state the facts quite clearly that Paul Hill was a member of the Belfast brigade of the provisonal IRA ( And Hill later did confess to being a member ) while Conlon had been a member of Na Fianna Eireann which is the youth section of the provisionals though Conlon was quickly kicked out ( Literally ) due to his heavy drinking and drug taking . They didn`t meet on the ferry as shown in the film but Conlon bumped into Hill in Southampton where Hill was staying . What was Hill doing in Southampton ? He was on the run from the IRA who wanted to question him about guns going missing and about the possibility of Hill being an informer , something that is always punishable in IRA ranks with death and prior torture . When Conlon returned to Belfast in December 1974 he did drunkenly mention to IRA acquaintances in pubs that he`d met Hill in England and in order to punish Hill for his suspected crimes against the organisation and to take the heat off their own cells active in Britain at the time it was the IRA themselves who deliberately leaked the false information to the intelligence services about Conlon and Hill being involved in the Guilford bombings , not as the film shows a jealous boyfriend . Hill was also later found guilty of the murder of a former soldier though is never shown in the film and it`s this playing hard and loose with the facts that almost threatens to destroy the film . It could have been worse though , there might have been the suggestion that the bombing could have been a mass suicide Well that`s the bad points out of the way . What`s IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER`s good points ? Well Jim Sheridan directs with a real kinetic force especially the early scene where Conlon is pursued by the Brits against a voodoo chile soundscape . Sheridan also gets the very best out of his cast . Emma Thompson is good as the crusading lawyer , Pete Postlethwaite is very good as Guiseppe Conlon , but the outstanding performance is by Daniel Day Lewis as Gerry Conlon . Has anyone noticed the bitter Irony of a film about injustice features one of the greatest injustices commited by the Oscar board voters where they gave that year`s best actor Oscar to a very average performance by Tom Hanks ? No wonder more and more people view the Oscars as a popularity contest . And despite my above criticisms about the facts - or lack of them - IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER can in no way be described as a pro IRA film in the way that THE DEVIL`S OWN  or SOME MOTHER`S SON are",In the Name of the Father
15,lastliberal,It is shocking new evidence.,8,27 March 2008,"With seven Oscar nominations, this film had the unfortunate luck to be competing in a remarkable year for films and won not a single one.It is a shame because director Jim Sheridan gave us a film that transcends the subject matter and was a delight to watch. The performances by Daniel Day-Lewis, Emma Thompson, and Pete Postlethwaite were simply incredible, and I even got a minute or two of Saffron Burrows as a London hippie.What makes this film so much more that a slam at British injustice in the face of terror, is that it is also a portrait of American injustice against Blacks. In the haste to get convictions and convince the public that they are competent, both systems use the same techniques.What is also common to both systems is the fact that after gross injustice is discovered, the prosecutors and police escape unharmed; while the lives of their victims are ruined forever.",In the Name of the Father
16,evanston_dad,Rousing Film About the Triumph of Justice,8,9 February 2009,"Following closely on the heels of another movie about the IRA, 1992's ""The Crying Game,"" came Jim Sheridan's effective and rousing ""In the Name of the Father,"" the true story of a group of men wrongly accused of participating in a series of IRA bombings.This film is fun to watch for its period detail and for the predictably excellent performance of Daniel Day-Lewis. But Emma Thompson, playing the attorney of Day-Lewis and his father (Pete Postlethwaite), though given a much smaller role, really brings some fire to the proceedings through her energetic performance. Thompson had just been discovered by American audiences in ""Howards End"" the year before, and was also winning acclaim in ""The Remains of the Day"" even as she was making her appearance in this one, and it was refreshing to see her in a more contemporary role.Though nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Day-Lewis), Best Supporting Actor (Postlethwaite), Best Supporting Actress (Thompson) and Best Director, the film was shut out.I'm not a huge fan of Jim Sheridan's movies in general, but I liked this one.Grade: A",In the Name of the Father
17,safenoe,I wonder what the Irish perspective is...,7,24 September 2016,"I found In the name of the Father very moving and it made you wonder about how many miscarriages of justice there were in the war on the IRA. I remember mentioning how much I liked this movie to an Irish guy and he really had harsh words to say about ITNOTF. I don't know if the Irish guy was Irish Republic Irish or Northern Ireland Irish. But on first glance I wonder how to tell them apart? Also how do you tell apart the Protestants and Catholics? The New York Times reviewer of the theater performance ""Quietly"", which deals with the troubles, wondered ""how did the enemies tell one another apart?""Good question indeed, and I guess they were able to unite and form a unity/coalition government in Northern Ireland after all. Maybe the troubles are less troublesome, so that's a good outcome after watching ITNOTF.Corin Redgrave was impressive in the role of UK police officer Robert Dixon, who I believe is a composite of police officers. Robert really was politically incorrect when it came to his service to the public.",In the Name of the Father
18,Sylviastel,Great Cast and writing makes for a wonderful true film about injustice!,10,2 January 2006,"It is no surprise that Peter Postlewaite O.B.E. was rated as one of Steven Spielberg's favorite actors. He gives an understated and well deserved academy award nomination for his performance as the father of Daniel Day-Lewis's character. You learn to easily accept them as father and son in this film. They work very well together. Emma Thompson also get a supporting role as the British lawyer who helps Gerry get out of prison and exonerated for the crimes. The film pulls no punches about the violent persuasion into making a false confession. It breaks your heart to see lies, propaganda, and innocent people going to prison for crimes they didn't commit in the first place but it does happen all the time which is why I am against capital punishment in my country for that reason. The film earned several academy award nominations including for best actor in which Daniel Day Lewis also became a naturalized Irish citizen. He would seem an unlikely candidate for British knighthood like his grandfather now. The film is more relevant today than when it was released. Terrorism has returned with a vengeance. People seem willing to put innocent people behind bars because of their ethnicity. We must learn a valuable lesson in not judging a book by its cover. In the meantime, prison life was not enjoyable but neither torturous. Both Gerry and Giuseppe Conlon are in prison together which makes the situation bearable. In fact the other prisoners are more decent and hospitable than the men who put the innocent men there in the first place. Gerry does honor his father's memory by clearing his injustice.",In the Name of the Father
19,JamesHitchcock,In the Name of the Father- and of the Son,7,14 August 2006,"Although considerable liberties have been taken with historical facts, this film is based upon true events. In 1974 an IRA bomb in a pub in Guildford, England, killed several people. Four young Irish people (""the Guildford Four"") were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Several others (""the Maguire Seven"") were convicted of assisting them and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. All were innocent of this crime, and were later exonerated and released from prison when fresh evidence was discovered, particularly evidence that their confessions had been obtained under duress.Although all the main characters are Catholics, some devout, some only nominally so, the title does not have any real religious significance. Rather, it alludes to the film's central relationship, that between Gerry Conlon, one of the ""Four"" and his father Giuseppe, one of the ""Seven"". The two are very different. Gerry is a wild and rebellious young man, unemployed, a petty criminal and a drug-user. He wears his hair long, something fashionable in the early seventies but often regarded by the older generation as the sign of a hooligan. Giuseppe, by contrast, is a conservative figure; deeply religious, hard-working, law-abiding and honest.A key moment comes when Gerry recalls a football match in which he played as a boy. His team won, but instead of congratulating him on his victory, Giuseppe reproached his son for a foul committed during the match. This encapsulates the difference in their characters. For Gerry, winning and success are all that matters. Because he has achieved little success, he has no faith in himself and has always drifted through life. For Giuseppe, adherence to moral values is more important than achieving outward success, and it is these values which enable him to retain his self-respect. Because of these differences in character and outlook, the two men's relationship is a difficult one. Beneath their differences, however, they also have a deep love for one another; Gerry is persuaded to confess to the bombing, after the police have failed to obtain a confession through bullying and violence, by the threat that his father will be killed if he does not. Later, Gerry's love for his father is strengthened by the realisation that although the older man is physically frail, his religious faith and self-belief enable him to cope with the injustice of his plight.Daniel Day-Lewis has been much praised for his performance as Gerry, and he was certainly good, if at times too showy. For me, however, the real star was Pete Postlethwaite as the long-suffering but dignified Giuseppe. The strongest scenes were those between Gerry and Giuseppe; the weakest were those when Gerry, in prison, befriends Joe McAndrew, an IRA man who claims actually to have planted the Guildford bomb. McAndrew is an invented character, and psychologically this did not seem likely; Gerry was, after all, as much a victim of the bomb as those killed and injured by it. Had there been no bomb, there could have been no conviction, wrongful or otherwise, for planting it. Moreover, by associating himself with the IRA's cause, even temporarily, Gerry, although legally innocent, makes himself seem morally guilty.There were other things that did not ring true. I was unsure why Giuseppe's lawyer thought that Inspector Dixon, the policeman who originally investigated the crime, would be responsible for deciding whether her ailing client should receive compassionate parole, or why so much attention was paid to Gerry's alibi that he was in London on the night of the bombing. As the bomb would have had a delayed-action timer, he could easily have returned before it exploded; the ""Horse and Groom"" pub (I used to live in Guildford) is only a short walk from the station, about half an hour by train from London. (The brutal and corrupt Dixon is another invented character; the name may refer ironically to the popular British TV show, ""Dixon of Dock Green"", which featured an honest and decent ""bobby"" named Dixon).It surprises me that some have criticised the film as being ""pro-IRA"". If one were setting out to make a pro-IRA propaganda film, one would not make it about the Guildford bombing, an event in which the IRA cold-bloodedly murdered several innocent civilians without warning. Nor does the film ignore the IRA's violence towards the Irish Catholic community it supposedly represents. At the time of the Guildford bombing, Gerry is living in London, having been forced to flee Northern Ireland by IRA threats; like most terrorist organisations it has a sternly moralistic attitude to all crimes other than those committed by its own members and punishes with mediaeval severity those who, like Gerry, are guilty of petty larcenies. The fact that the ""Four"" and the ""Seven"" were undoubtedly treated unjustly by the British authorities does not retrospectively justify the IRA's crimes of which they were wrongly accused.The film does not attempt to be a comprehensive statement about the Northern Ireland situation- the Unionist community, for example, is not even mentioned. Indeed, given the complexities of that situation, and the even greater complexities of Irish history from which it springs, it would not be possible to make such a statement in a film. Nevertheless, ""In the Name of the Father"" is a very good film, both as a study of father-son relationships and as a warning of the possibilities for injustice inherent in any criminal justice system. 7/10 A goof. In the early scenes, set in 1974, Gerry, while driving along London's Lower Thames Street passes a set of orange and white barriers designed to stop vehicles from entering ""The City"" (London's central financial district). These barriers did not exist in 1974; they were erected following a later IRA bombing campaign",In the Name of the Father
20,namashi_1,A True Masterpiece!,10,28 October 2010,"'In The Name Of The Father' is a milestone motion picture. Prolific Filmmaker Jim Sheridan, takes a giant leap in his cinema with his 1993 offering. 'In The Name Of The Father' is a biographical film, it is based on the true life story of the Guildford Four, four people falsely convicted of the IRA's Guildford pub bombings which killed four off-duty British soldiers and a civilian. One of the most shameful verdicts in Court History, is brilliantly done on Screen with a Running-Time over 130-minutes. Jim Sheridan's direction is excellent. He handles such a difficult subject, with such ease, that you have no choice but to be in awe of him. Peter Biziou's Cinematography is exciting. 'In The Name Of The Father' is filled with Legendary Performances: Daniel Day-Lewis proves his supremacy, yet again. Playing a real-life character, with the accurate body language, and dialogue delivery. Pete Postlethwaite as Lewis's Dad, does wonders. In a supporting role, he steals the show. Emma Thompson is flawless. She might not have a lot of screen time, but whenever she appears on screen, she leaves a strong impression. John Lynch is another topper; he excels from start to end. Tom Wilkinson in a brief role, is superb.On the whole, 'In The Name Of The Father' is A True Masterpiece! A film that deserves a Standing Ovation! Don't miss this one, at any cost!",In the Name of the Father
21,ElMaruecan82,"In the Name of Respect, Dignity and Truth ...",9,10 February 2013,"After ""My Left Foot"", 1989' inspirational biopic of one of the most famous Irish artists, that received universal acclaim and earned his first Oscar to Daniel Day-Lewis, Jim Sheridan relates four years later another page of Irish history through ""In the Name of the Father"", a powerful and solid drama comforting Day-Lewis' reputation as one of the most talented actors of his generation.""In the Name of the Father"", chronicles the events that lead to the arrest of the infamous 'Guildford Four': four Irish people falsely accused and convicted for the bombing of the London pub of the same name. It's a nice directorial touch that the film opens with the explosion that killed five innocent persons, the very action that would imply a vengeance- ridden reaction from the British law. Innocent people would then pay for the crime, and this is the tragedy of Gerard Patrick Conlon, a feckless Irish lead stealer, who was in London at the wrong place, at the wrong moment.Yet even as a true story, the injustice and level of sadism displayed by the British Police, with the relative complicity of the Court, seem unbelievable, flirting with the most one- dimensional kind of cinematic Manichaeism. This is where the context plays a crucial role: after a series of bombing terrorizing the British population, the Parliament voted a Terrorism Act allowing the Police to arrest suspects for seven days. Although the use of torture was prohibited, any other kind of pressure became legitimate and could be used to force the suspects to sign a confession, or their own convictions' papers. We're in a sort of post September-11 like paranoia, where the British system, lacking all the necessary perspective to properly investigate the case would spot the perfect scapegoats to compensate their own ineffectiveness. Any rational mind wouldn't believe an IRA bomber or criminal mastermind would rob a prostitute and goes back to his home like Gerry did. But those were irrational, fear-induced times. The torture scenes benefits from the spectacular performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, as the tough hoodlum reveals a vulnerable side, demonstrating innocence in every single meaning of the word. The nervous breakdown is inevitable, marking the triumph of the sadist Police officer played by Corin Redgrave, followed by a tragic domino effect.Gerry's friends and family are all arrested, including his father Giuseppe, a honest, hard- working and sensible man. It was Giuseppe who encouraged Gerry to leave Belfast for London, fearing an arrest because of his illegal activities. And Giuseppe, the character who revealed the immense actor who was the late Pete Potlewhaite, is the soul of the film. He incarnates both the educational background of Gerry: an apparent failure, and a constant guiding force meant to elevate his son, to a level of dignity despite the adversity. The titular father is Giuseppe, and the gap between him and Gerry would trace the line of Gerry's evolution and understanding process, the ultimate key of his moral triumph. The roots of Day-Lewis' torments are to have given up the conflict against the system for the more convenient one: his father, the one who holds for being responsible of all his faults. By constantly patronizing him, Giuseppe forged Gerry's rebellious instinct. Gerry lost self- respect by blaming everything on his father. He never shared room with him, but this one fictionalization is perhaps the strike of genius because the best moments of the film all focus on the father-and-son relationship. Giuseppe accepts fate as it comes while Gerry fights back without thinking. Gradually, Gerry's experience will reveal the limits of his own perceptions, even when it comes to the Irish responsibilities. The jail scenes plays a powerful counterpart to the black-and-white depiction of the British justice and are also the setting of the greatest and most emotional performances from the trio Day-Lewis, Postlewhaite and Emma Thompson as the British lawyer who'd reopen the case and allow the 'Guildford Four' to be rejudged, for an immediate release, fifteen years after the first sentence. Giuseppe would never be a free man and his death from pulmonary condition would forge the spirit of his son and give a meaning to his fight for Justice. Jim Sheridan's film is a powerful human drama featuring a magnificent and emotionally gripping metamorphosis of the central character. However, the film suffers from a few flaws on the scenes' arrangements, a criticism I also had with ""My Left Foot"" whose clumsy editing left a few interrogation marks, notably on the relationship between Day-Lewis and his father. ""In the Name of the Father"" seems so eager to be a poignant father-and-son story, a character study that the trial part was treated with more rush, only leveraged by the powerful acting of Daniel Day-Lewis. A few less scenes would have allowed to focus on Thompson's investigation, and prevent the final trial from its rather abrupt or anticlimactic feeling, maybe less the trial than the way the pivotal evidence were found. However, this is rather a regret than a criticism, the film still relies on Day-Lewis tour de force and his believable transition from a young self-centered thug to a man who'd do his best to Honor the memory of his father It's fitting that one of the scenes feature ""The Godfather"", especially the garden moment between Vito and Michael as the very scene represented the succession between the two persons, the transmission of heritage, between Giuseppe and his son, the transmission of common values. Conlon's personal fight would be to find out the part of him he had in common with his father, and make the most of it. In the Name of His Father.",In the Name of the Father
22,ThomasDrufke,Courtroom Classic,8,16 September 2015,"Courtroom drama's are always prime for great cinema. In the Name of the Father is no different. It shouldn't come as any surprise with Daniel Day-Lewis as the lead, and he is incredible as Gerry Conlon, a wrongfully convicted terrorist in 1970's London. I have to admit I didn't know much about the bombings upon viewing, so this whole story came as a shock to me. But the film is a really good eye opener and reminder that no one is guilty until proved innocent, and then some.Pete Postlethwaite and Emma Thompson were both nominated for supporting roles and they really do carry this film. I would almost say more so than Day-Lewis. I knew he would give a killer performance but i didn't know the other two had this in them, especially Postlethwaite. The film also closely deals with the relationship between Gerry and his father. The many ups and downs they go through as a result of being in a jail for so many years. Gerry is a scoundrel at best towards the beginning. They show him stealing right off the bat to give us the impression that this may be a character you may not be able to trust. In fact, I wasn't even sure if I could trust him up until he was being beaten by the detectives to sign the confession.I will say I wasn't a huge fan of the direction to begin the film. Jim Sheridan had a knack for choppy directing early on that was hard to follow. But once the film settles in and gets going as a true courtroom genre, the film takes off. I also like that the film tackles the issue of non-violent vs. violent protests and tactics in a fair way. It isn't clear to me that the filmmakers believe one way or the other is the way to go. And I think that's the right way to go about it. +All the performances+Tension built in the court-Choppy directing to start8.4/10",In the Name of the Father
23,g-bodyl,Powerful Performances!,10,14 March 2013,"If you ever wanted a tutorial on perfect acting, In the Name of the Father is the perfect film to turn to. This is a very powerful film that features perhaps some of the best acting of the 1990's. This is a film, although somewhat historically inaccurate, will make viewers weep at times and cheer for the characters at other times. I have rarely seen a movie so powerful and uplifting but heart-wrenching as well.Jim Sheridan's film is about the Guilford Four and how they were wrongfully implicated by the British for an IRA bombing. The supposed leader, Gerry Conlon is sent to life in prison and is joined by his father. Together, for the next fifteen years, they do what they can to prove they're innocent and gain their freedom.Daniel-Day Lewis. Just reading that name aloud gives me goosebumps. He is the greatest actor of our generation if not the best of all time. He gives another masterful performance as Gerry Conlon. He is truly the best method actor I have ever seen. Pete Postlethwaite gives the strongest performance of his career as Gerry's caring but stern father. Emma Thompson doesn't have much screen time until the end but her screen time is well worth the wait.Overall, this is one of the best films of a decade that features some of the best film-making in cinema history. I'm glad to say this film would have joined their ranks. Even the most stern grouch would be in tears at the end of the film. I feel bad that Daniel did not take home the Oscar for the film even though Tom Hanks deserves it for his performance in Philadelphia. I rate this film 10/10.",In the Name of the Father

Literally I just had to keep watching and gluing to this movie because even though it was years ago, you still want to see Gerry and co being released from jail and live their lives. Unfortunately, Gerry's father wasn't able to experience the freedom with his son and friends as he died in the jail. Very heartbreaking it must have been for the family and like, you just can imagine the effort they put in to try and get everyone out! I would be honestly fighting my way to save my brother from being in prison til his death! Kudos to Daniel Day-Lewis and all the actors involved in this brilliant documentary movie.

Superbly acted, directed and written, this is one of those pictures you won't shake it of easily after seeing it. No, it's not gruesome of gory, but at times it's disturbing in showing us the reality. The situation that these people have faced is not an enviable. I haven't heard about this case in real life, and i somehow don't believe that everything that was shown in this movie happened in reality just like this, but it's a dramatization of the events, and it's an amazing one.

26,ironhorse_iv,"In the Name of the Father, the son, and the Holy Spirit. This was indeed a great movie. Amen for that.",8,18 March 2014,"Directed by Jim Sheridan, this biographical film based on the autobiography, 'Proved Innocent: The Story of Gerry Conlon of the Guildford Four' by Gerry Conlon. The movie focus on the Gerry Conlon's memoir of his imprisonment in England, for a crime, he didn't commit. In the film, Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a trouble young man who would rather explore free love and dope than get a real job. After Gerry Conlon get in deep trouble in Belfast for stripping lead from roofs of houses and causing a riot with British security forces. Gerry's father, Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), saves him from IRA punishment, by sending off to London to stay with his aunt, for his own good. While, at London, an explosion at a pub in Guildford kills five people (four soldiers and a civilian) and wounds 74, and Gerry Conlon find himself, prime suspect in the crime. Soon the Conlon home is raided by the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary arrest both, Gerry and Giuseppe. After being torture and threated, both agree to sign a confession to a crime, they didn't commit. After years of being mistreat in prison, Gerry finally grew up from bitter son who rails against his father's wishes, to fight for justice for himself, his father and those, whom were wrongly convicted when he discovers who the real perpetrator of the bombing are. With help with Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson), a campaigning lawyer, Gerry try to overturn the falsely convicted of the 1974 IRA's Guildford pub bombings. Will he triumph and gain his freedom or will he fail? Watch it, to find out. Even, so, the film is pretty predictable on the ending outcome, but that's not the main reason, not to watch this movie. You should watch it, to get a true understanding of the thought of being forced to live in a prison like that for seventeen years, accused of a crime, you had no part of. It made my stomach turn and I wept. In the climate of near-hysteria, the Prevention of Terrorism Act was passed, allowing the UK police to interrogate suspects for up to seven days without bringing charges or allowing access to an attorney. Americans like myself should watch it, because a similar Act was passed here, after Sept. 11, 2001. Both acts are not right, and need to review. If this movie doesn't raise your blood pressure over the miscarriage of justice, the arrogance of leadership and the need for each individual to judge according to their conscience and not their prejudices, nothing will. Another reason is because the film really work on being a gripping drama between the relationship of father and son. The movie took some liberties by showing the father/son relationship enhanced by sharing a cell in prison, which they never did in real life. I was immediately drawn into the story by Daniel Day-Lewis' as well, as Pete Postletwaite performances in both legal and personal perspectives. Both are great in this film giving the audience emotional depth. The language is a bit harsh in this movie, lot of cursing, but understanding heavy Irish accents as I do, watching a subtitled edition of this film might be a good idea. Some people might not like this movie due to its over impartially case that Britain misrules Northern Ireland, violates Irish civil rights and knowingly compromises its own legal system. I study a lot about the Troubles between England and Northern Ireland, but I really doubt every Englishman is a corrupt anti-Irish bigot. It might be a bit over exaggeration. Though some minor facts were changed, some the major 'facts' are just not real. Example like the crucial character of Joe McAndrew (Don Baker), an IRA man who might had something to do with the bombings is just a fictional character. Still, what remains as truth is gut wrenching when you think about it. Given the subject matter, the film was still well received in protestant areas of Ireland and in England. The film does shows that English public attitudes turned into a highly supportive for the Conlons' freedom when it started to become clear that they were not the culprits for these atrocities nor does the film make the IRA terrorists look like heroes. It is a bit frustrating that people take what the film tells them as fact, but this doesn't take away from the fact that this is a well made, engaging and quite moving film. Regardless of people's political beliefs or the idea that the film might be a bit political bias. The film is a good movie that never really tip over into slushiness or being over preaching or ranting. The music soundtrack is amazing to hear. I love Bono and Gavin Friday ""In the Name of the Father"". Epic and beautiful. Another great song is 'You Made Me The Thief Of Your Heart"" performed by Sinead O' Connor. Quite inspiring. Overall, I thought this film was fascinating to watch. While the troubles are now over with 1998's Good Friday Agreement. I think the film is still very important to watch in a post-9/11 world because it makes us question our current government's hastiness to find answers and make executive decisions. It makes you wonder if our government is or had jail innocent people. Hands down, a politically and emotionally charged issue such as that, is needed to be question. In the Name of the Father shows a good example of that.",In the Name of the Father
27,briancham1994,Harrowing tale of injustice,9,13 September 2021,"Daniel Day-Lewis' performance as the young, irresponsible Gerry Conlon is a great example of a familiar and relatable figure thrust into chilling circumstances. Guilty of nothing but his Irish origins, Gerry and his friends and family are brutally abducted by the British police and tortured into confessing to a terrorist act they had nothing to do with. The scenes of violence, including the riot at the beginning, the terrorist attack and the police torture, show just how big the stakes are. The other actors are also great in their naturalistic portrayals, including Gerry's friend, his father and the real IRA terrorist who ends up in prison, which underpins the reality of the scenario and thus its horror.",In the Name of the Father
28,Thanos_Alfie,Everything for truth...,8,1 March 2015,"""In the Name of the Father"" is a drama movie which is based on true events about a man who coerced confession about a bomb of an IRA bombing, but he did not do it. This had as a result the imprisonment of him and his father and also some other friends of him. An English lawyer fights to free them all and does whatever is possible to succeed this.I really liked this movie because it is based on true events and as a result I liked the plot of it. I also liked this movie because it shows the fight of man for the truth and what he has to do in order to be able to succeed this. What difficulties has to surpass and what emotions feel about these situations that he lives in. Daniel Day-Lewis who played as Gerry Conlon was simply outstanding in his role for one more time. In addition to this it has to being mentioned the interpretation of Pete Postlethwaite who played as the father of Gerry Conlon, Giuseppe Conlon and I believe that his interpretation gave a different view for everyone who watch this movie.Finally I have to say that ""In the Name of the Father"" is a must see movie and I strongly recommend it to everyone to watch. When you watch this movie I am sure that you will understand many things such the true meaning of a fight and what a person has to do not only for himself but also for his family, his friends and all the other world.",In the Name of the Father
29,eddie_baggins,A classic tale of justice and determination,8,22 September 2021,"The crowning achievement in Irish director Jim Sheridan's career to date, with his film nominated for 7 Oscars in the 1994 Academy Awards ceremony including one for Best Picture and Best Director, the based on the true story In the Name of the Father is an incredibly well acted and scripted drama that nowadays may feel more familiar to viewers than those that watched it with fresh eyes upon release but one that still holds a power over and grip on viewer's to this day.Based around the story of Irish based father and son Gerry and Giuseppe Conlan, two simple souls from Ireland who were unfortunately targeted by British police in relation to an horrific London bombing attack by the IRA in 1974 and alongside other innocent acquittances jailed for heinous crimes they never committed, Father clearly harbors a story Sheridan and his two leading men Daniel Day-Lewis and the late Pete Postlethwaite were passionate about as they bring the Conlan's story to life.As is too be expected from work by quality actors such as Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite, Father's power and memorability is helped along by their stunning work and it's sad to think that with Day-Lewis now retired from acting and Postlethwaite having passed away in the years following Father's release that these performers can no longer give us turns like this and watching the two industry stalwarts join forces as a father and son that at times are at odds against one another but at other times beautifully bonded in love, is the type of high caliber material moviegoers often seek out but rarely find.Unlike some of his other big turns in his most famous roles in the likes of Gangs of New York or There Will Be Blood where he chewed scenery and anything else that was in his path in the best possible way, Day-Lewis in particular is a lot different to how we usually expect to see him as the care-free, mischievous and ultimately likeable Gerry, a man who dabbles in petty thievery and partying but is anything but a cold blooded murderer and his turn here is easily up their with some of his best performances in a career that was littered with them.Allowing us to get know Gerry before he became a wrongly imprisoned criminal, looking for new opportunities in London as his country of Ireland is torn apart by pointless war and carnage ensures there's a lot of audience good will for him and his kindly father and while the film never strays off the well-trodden path of these type of fight for justice films that have become a mainstay of Hollywood and other cinema for some time, there's a quality and heart to Father that will ensure its place in the hearts and minds of audiences for years yet to come.Final Say -It never does anything in a way we wouldn't of expected from this type of story but there's an undeniable power in the Conlan's story and the performances of Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite are as good as you could possibly get from two leads.4 seat carvings out of 5.",In the Name of the Father
30,johnnyboyz,Excellent character study of a man wrongfully imprisoned and further forced to balance finding justice with finding solace with his father.,8,28 May 2009,"In the Name of the Father is an epic tale of hope and mistaken identity, a towering achievement of sorts focusing on everyday and very likable central characters as they are put through an awful emotional grinder based on true events from the 1970s and 80s. The film is spoilt only very slightly by a quite woeful theme song from Irish band U2 and the fact director Jim Sheridan cannot much direct action, forcing the very early few scenes to come across as awkward and misjudged. The rest, however, is a dedicated study of a dedicated man forced into becoming a hate figure; a fall guy of sorts, as the British government struggle to come up with answers regarding the ongoing struggles in the conflict with the Irish Republican Army.The film is a tale of fighting for justice, a tale of independence and the duty one must go through in order to attain that independence. The road is long and the times get desperate; the characters face long stretches of prison time for things they did not do – years were incorrectly taken off their lives and the result of it all is condensed down into a two and a bit hour film that you can most certainly go out of your way to see. What is two hours of your time compared to thirty odd years of someone else's, after all?The film is essentially told in a flashback perspective, a story that is distilled through lawyer Gareth Peirce's (Thompson) imagination as she envisages the lead character doing what he does as he narrates to her exactly what went down through a cassette recording. But we are there as well, we are back in the 1970s and 80s with the lead character as they lead a relatively upbeat and happy-go-lucky life initially before the tragedy strikes. The lead is Gerry Conlon (Day-Lewis), a young Northern Irishman from Belfast who is living a life surrounded by IRA-led activity in the 1970s without ever directly being involved, but he is the sort of guy who gets caught in the cross-fire; a sort of 'wrong place, wrong time' scenario-led life that will catch up with him in horrific ways later on. When we first see Gerry, the likable rouge attitude and relatively odd choice of song by way of Jimi Hendrix sees him get chased by British troops that mistake him for an IRA sniper – the scene has a fair amount of 'fun' to it; something that is brought back down to Earth later on.There is a sad irony and that is that it is proposed Gerry should move away from Northern Ireland following these scenes in order to get away from the troubles. Gerry agrees and takes a boat over to England with a friend named Paul Hill (Lynch), before briefly settling down in London. Initially, the film plays on Gerry being a bit of a misfit in this new setting; he mixes mostly with casual drug takers, hippies and devout, air headed female vegetarians. This unconnected and grounded realism driven segment in the film is impressive and mysterious. Having no knowledge of who these people are and what eventually happens to them will have you see the film as this wandering and series of supposedly random events in a specific time setting as Gerry wanders the streets; talks to tramps, thieves from the homes of those that accidentally drop their keys right outside the front door and looks for short stay accommodation here and there.But what follows is a change in gear and a change in study, indeed a change that encompasses desperation; mistaken identity; the hunt for redemption and the forcing of confronting issues regarding the relationship with one's father. A bomb is detonated within the vicinity of Gerry's general area one night and he is singled out by the police for his Irish roots and the fact he has only very recently arrived in England. He is jailed, with his father, as a part of the 'Maguire Seven', before desperately trying to claim justice. As a lead character, Gerry later embodies all the innocent and necessary traits for a victim just trying to survive. The film's point of attack takes special care in painting a wavy image for Gerry, one that sees him rob apartments of money, joke about with his mates and come across as quite antagonistic at times.Gerry and his father's, named Giuseppe (Postlethwaite), coming together in prison provide some of the more fascinating scenes in the film; a forced period of bonding during which they humblingly make peace and mend the past problems that they shared from years gone by. There is enough in the film to get caught up in, a sense of tragedy and mis-justice; a sense of pain and desperation. As far as prison set dramas go, this is one of the more impressive I've seen.",In the Name of the Father

A Staggering reality of Quick Injustice and Late Justice. In The Name Of The Father should be placed among the Most Gutsy films ever for so many reasons but one solid and unshakeable reason is that, it dealt with the Cruel politics of Legal System and Exposed the Government. I would have loved it even if had been a fictional story but believing that is actually happened is still scorching my nerves. Of course this might just be the half truth and it's still very shocking, the full cruelty mustn't have been exposed because of fear (i believe so). You can read the synopsis anywhere on internet if you wish to so i am not gonna talk about the script. Rather, I would like to tell my views how it is crafted. This staggering reality would have been shocking anyways but this film comes out better than what expected because of its incredible storytelling flow. From the beginning till the end every event is so accurately driven by the Director, every next thing follow up the previous one in tight linear equations and then we have a climax which will force you to shout out and scream out your anger. I actually screamed in the Climax scene and my Mobile fell down. Daniel Day Lewis what a Great Actor you are. I don't really have words to say. What a Top Class actor he is. A Legend. Philip King scores equally but of course 2nd best and Emma Thompson 3rd naturally. Dear Jim Sheridan where are you i want to salute you. Ok, wherever you are just accept my Salute. What a Fabulous storyteller he is. No compromises at all i mean how? How can someone be so perfect in Director's chair while handling such a staggering film? See i don't wanna make it long, i would just say ""In The Name Of The Father"" is Very Important film for every cinema lover.

It's incredibly well- made, it's fast-paced, brilliantly acted, and very passionate and interesting.Standing out in the stunningly engrossing cast are Daniel Day-Lewis and Emma Thompson, who are both always wonderfully appealing, and though I'm not sure I'll ever see Day-Lewis in any performance that surpasses the magnetism and captivating charm of Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York, he wows here, conveying such a deeply felt character. Thompson, whom I just recently re-watched in Primary Colors as an entirely different character, proves herself a true chameleon, completely taking all forms of her role.It isn't approached from the angle of structuring the story the generally most appealing way, even though it seems like it, intercutting flashbacks with the present and such. It simply follows the characters through their own arcs, and the film becomes the most interesting and engaging film I've seen in weeks. The hardships they endure, the conflicts that fall into their laps, the drama that ensues, and the prospect of justice are all just so absorbing that you have to see it to believe it.

34,Vartiainen,About the dangers of giving into your fear and anger,6,14 January 2019,"October 1974, London. Young Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) gets arrested by the police. They claim he is an IRA (Irish Republican Army) terrorist and to blame for the bombing in Guildford that killed five people. Gerry maintains that he's innocent, but the police and the people of Britain are hungry for blood. The film is based on real events.As you can imagine, the film is anything but congratulatory towards the society and the justice system of the 70s. The film focuses heavily on Conlon's own personal experiences before and after the bombing, but the film takes it time to get the licks in.Daniel Day-Lewis has earned a reputation as one of the great names in cinema and watching this movie you can certainly see why. It all feels authentic, from the quiet rage to desperation to just giving up, if not outright snapping. I also really liked the performance given by Pete Postlethwaite as Giuseppe, Gerry's father.A heavy movie and makes one appreciate how one has managed to grow in relative peace and quiet. Sure modern Europe has had its own upheavals, but nothing quite like this.If I had to name a negative, I would say that the film is a bit episodic, like many biographical films tend to be. It's better than most I've seen, but the film has to jump around in time a lot and these transitions are not quite as graceful as they perhaps could have been.Still, an interesting movie and a great watch for all fans of historical drama.",In the Name of the Father
35,estebangonzalez10,More proof that Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time,9,20 December 2013,"""I don't understand your language. ""Justice."" ""Mercy."" ""Clemency."" I literally don't understand what those words mean.""If I had to describe this film using only one adjective I would say it is an enraging movie. Jim Sheridan followed his successful directorial debut, My Left Foot, by teaming up once again with Daniel Day Lewis who delivers yet another superb performance. I'm ashamed to admit that I just got around to watching this film for the first time on its 20th anniversary, but it was completely worth it because I was blown away by this powerful and engaging film. I wouldn't call this a groundbreaking film because we've had plenty of movies dealing with similar themes. Films like The Hurricane or The Shawshank Redemption deal with the kind of social injustice that is presented here where an innocent man is incarcerated due to a corrupt justice system. In the Name of the Father differs a bit in that it doesn't focus so much on the hope of finding freedom, but rather on the enraging aspect of the injustice that the lead character and his family and friends go through. This is a genre that I'll always be drawn too, especially when it is based on a true story because I think these people deserve to have their voice heard after all they've gone through. I know that several artistic liberties were taken to make the film, but even so it draws attention to Gerry Conlon's autobiographical book. Sheridan's direction was solid, and I liked how he focused a lot of the attention on the father and son relationship. I don't know if this film would've worked as well as it did if it weren't for Daniel Day Lewis's brilliant performance. He is without a doubt one of the best actors of our time.Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day Lewis) grew up in Belfast in the 70's when the IRA terrorist attacks were at its peak. He was never involved with the terrorist group, but he was no saint either. As a young lad he felt forced to become a small time thief due to the lack of employment. While robbing some lead sheets from a roof of a house he accidentally leads British soldiers to a home that was hiding IRA weapons. Fortunately they never discovered anything, and the IRA members send Gerry off with a warning. His father, Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite), with whom he's had an estranged relationship, sends him to London hoping he can find a better future there and escape from all the political turmoil. On his way to London, Gerry runs into his school friend Paul Hill (John Lynch) and together they decide to go visit their friend Patrick Armstrong (Mark Sheppard) who has been living in London along with a group of free spirited hippies. Unfortunately for Gerry and his friends, they end up being in the wrong place at the wrong time and are accused of bombing a soldier's pub. Bullied by the police officers they are forced into signing a confession and are sentenced to prison along with some of Gerry's family members. In prison, Gerry and his father continue to fight to prove their innocence with the help of an attorney named Gareth Pierce (Emma Thompson) and the more she digs into the story the more corruption she finds in the police procedures.The film manages to draw you in and make your blood boil due to all the injustices suffered by these characters. It is one of those movies where the tension builds up with the passing of time, but at the same time you also feel a connection growing between Gerry and his father. The film becomes more than a simple social injustice tale and turns into a character driven story focusing on the relationship between father and son. It is a shame the film has kind of been forgotten because I thought it was really well made. It never won an Academy Award, but it did receive 7 nominations including Best Picture, losing out to Schindler's List that year. Daniel Day Lewis outshines everyone in this film, although the supporting cast was very strong, especially Pete Postlethwaite who shared great chemistry with Lewis. This was an intense film that had me at the edge of my seat thanks to the way in which Sheridan tells the story and slowly draws the viewer in. The final 20 minutes of this film are perfect and Daniel Day Lewis knocks his performance out of the ball park.",In the Name of the Father

37,gcd70,Will stir your soul and disturb you,8,7 January 2008,"In 1974 a London pub in the town of Guildford was hit by I.R.A. activists with a terrorists bomb, and no warning was given. Five people were killed and several others maimed and injured in a tragedy which sent shock waves through a then terrified and outraged public who demanded police bring the culprits to justice.Director and co-writer Jim Sheridan (scripting with Terry George) brings us the story of a group of young people from Ireland who were brought forward by police to face the charges of murder that related to the bombing. They were unceremoniously tried and found guilty, then sentenced to between fifteen years and life. Pleading their innocence to an unsympathetic jury and public had got them nowhere, so they were left to fight for their freedom from the inside.As father and son Giuseppe and Gerry Conlon, both Pete Postlethwaite and Daniel Day-Lewis give passionate and outstanding performances as they struggle with both their failed relationship and the battle to prove their innocence. Emma Thompson gives a strong performance too as lawyer Gareth Peirce, the woman who has taken up the appeal. All other cast members are impressive.Sheridan presents a highly charged, emotional drama which tells a horrifying tale in what is a black period in Irish and English history that continues even today. While he perhaps could have shown us more of the people's reaction and the feeling of the time, he instead concentrates on the Conlon's plight and their never ending fight for justice. Due credit must also go to Jim Sheridan for keeping what would have to be an incident and an issue that is close to his heart, very evenly balanced, as both sides are portrayed as equally guilty of terrible and unspeakable acts.Backed up by some very good cinematography, editing and set direction, ""In the Name of the Father"" is certainly a movie that will stir your soul and disturb you. It is truly frightening what men in power are capable of, and even more frightening are the devastating effects they can have on so many people's lives.Saturday, June 18, 1994 - Greater Union MelbourneDirector Jim Sheridan's account of one of the most ruthless bombings undertaken by the IRA is jam-packed with emotion. The tragic, moving story of how the ""Guildford Four"" lost their freedom, and fifteen years of their lives, for something they were never a part of makes for a most upsetting and aggravating film.The powerhouse performances from leads Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite are sensational, as is Emma Thompson's showing as compassionate lawyer Gareth Pierce.Not seeing this film would almost be as grave an injustice as was that which befell these innocent people.Monday, June 12, 1995 - Video",In the Name of the Father

The acting is all top notch, and the themes about standing up to injustice are great. Really, I think my biggest problem with this film is that I felt as if it was leading me by the hand emotionally. Every scene where something emotional happens, the music swells and the performances get more dramatic; there are impassioned monologues and tearful revelations... it just feels like everyone is trying so freaking hard to get me to care about everything. If they hadn't played up the overly dramatic parts of this movie I probably would've enjoyed it a bit more.",In the Name of the Father
39,Seraphion,Very solid in all aspects,7,30 October 2015,"The story gets nicely and quickly direct. It greatly covers many subjects beside the focus on the wrongful imprisonment. There are also the father- son relationship, small instances of youth mischief, the overall Troubles in Belfast and the pressure that makes the four confessed what they didn't do. The visuals are also great thing to see. The early Belfast depiction is something very attention grabbing. I watched '71 some time ago and now know where does the movie get their inspiration to depict the Belfast chaos. The acting overall is also a great job. Daniel Day-Lewis did great in portraying the character's personality and the changes happened through the fifteen years. Emma Thomson did well enough through her relatively short screen time. Pete Postlethwaite also did very well in balancing Daniel Day-Lewis' performance.",In the Name of the Father
40,philip_vanderveken,Perhaps a bit too black and white but still very impressive.,8,1 January 2005,"Even though this movie seems a bit too black and white from time to time I must say that it still is an impressive piece of cinema. Too black and white because I sometimes had the feeling that they had left out some parts to make it all a lot easier for the viewer. I can't help believing that Conlon and Hill weren't the nicest guys either, but the movie shows them almost as saints (except for the fact that they steal some lead from the roofs, they never really do anything wrong). Does that mean that this movie isn't any good? Certainly not! It still remains very impressive and the idea that injustice in the name of protecting the country should be allowed is awful and so it is good that at least some movie makers aren't afraid to protest against it.The movie tells the story about Gerry Conlon and his old school friend Paul Hill. They both are small time criminals and because of their own safety they have to live in London for a while. Otherwise they might get shot by the IRA. In London they stay in a community of hippies, but aren't welcomed by everybody. As a bomb explodes in a pub, one of the members from the community goes to the police and accuses them of the crime. They are immediately apprehended, together with Conlon's father, his aunt and her family. What follows is a process full of corruption and false accusations, putting them in jail for many years even though they haven't done anything wrong.The film is very good. It's well acted, well paced and well directed. The story is touching and I never got bored when watching it. Therefor I give it an 8/10.",In the Name of the Father

Gerry's father, Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), later saves him from IRA punishment, and he is sent off to London to stay with his aunt, for his own good. Instead, he finds a squat, to explore, as he puts it, ""free love and dope."" One evening by chance he gains entry to a prostitute's flat and he steals the £700 he finds there and chats briefly with a man sitting in a park; on that evening in Guildford there is an explosion at a pub that kills four off-duty soldiers and a civilian, and wounds sixty-five others.While Gerry has returned to Belfast to show off his stolen money, one of the squat residents talks to the authorities and the Conlon home is raided by the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary, who arrest Gerry and immediately place him on a military flight to the UK mainland. Gerry and his friend, Paul Hill (John Lynch) are interrogated by police who torture and threaten them until both finally agree to sign a confession after being held for up to seven days under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. When Gerry's father travels from Belfast to England to help his son, he is arrested at the aunt's home. In the subsequent trial, his aunt's family (known as the Maguire Seven, including Conlon's father) are convicted of supporting the bombing on the basis of nitroglycerin traces, and the four, including Gerry, are sentenced to long terms of imprisonment.",In the Name of the Father
42,Howlin Wolf,Stunning.,10,29 March 2001,"Words cannot accurately describe how affecting this movie is.   The story itself is harrowing, but the way in which Day Lewis portrays Gerry Conlon is heartbreaking at times.  Several scenes in the film may be hard to take for those with a sensitive nature.   Captures the mood and the time perfectly for someone like me, who is not Irish, lives nowhere near Guildford and wasn't even alive at the time of the pub bombings.   I really wasn't expecting anything special when I sat down to watch this. I could not have been more wrong.   The soundtrack is great without exception too!

43,KUAlum26,"Themes of ""Terrorism"" and ""draconian laws"" resound loudly still",8,1 June 2005,"This offering of a movie is very much an Irish/English story: the not-very-well known story(At least here in the States) of Gerry Conlon and the Guilford Four is mostly a tale of how a stupid,impetuous petty thief,Mr.Conlon(played with unrelenting energy from DAniel Day_lewis)is railroaded,along with his friends,his father(played with great dignity by Pete Postelthwaite) and about five others,into confessing complicity in a London pub bombing in the early-to-mid seventies. The focus is almost entirely on Gerry,as he at first accepts his fate as a criminal,languishing in a very hostile English prison, only to be slowly won over to fight for his innocence by his very upright father,who never gives up hope in winning an appeal of their conviction. Emma Thompson's part as the ""Four""'s lawyer is not minor,but she really only comes into play more than halfway though the film.Still,she's as impassioned and stirring as ever.I use the title line of my review to say that even though the film's subject is very universal,it's themes are EERILY applicable to our war on terror in the USA. I feel like there's more than a little of this ""at all costs"" approach to finding terror suspects.Politics aside,this was quite a strong movie,co-written by Terry George(""Hotel Rwanda"",another very strong film!) and directed by Jim Sheridan(""My Left Foot"").

45,miguelneto-74936,a film that perfectly depicts the injustice upon Gerry Conlon and his friends.,8,12 September 2016,"In the 70s, an IRA bombing kills five people in a pub Guildford town near London. Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a rebellious young Irishman who ends up being wrongly accused of the crime, and gets life in prison along with three other friends. Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), his father tries to help him, but is condemned too.

46,film-critic,They can't block out the light in here.,8,21 March 2006,"I am quickly becoming aware of the power that Jim Sheridan has behind the camera as well as in crafting genuine non-Hollywood films. As I watched In the Name of the Father unfold, I continually was impressed by the passionate camera angles, the conviction of the characters, and Sheridan's ability not to sway from his own personal heritage. From the opening sequences of this film to the amazing direction to the dedicated actors, I knew that In the Name of the Father was going to be more than just your typical political ""courtroom"" drama. It wasn't until the film was finished that I realized Sheridan's power. I speak very highly of him in the opening of this review because I believe that if any other director would have been at the helm of this project that the final cut would not have been as immaculate. Typically with films of this nature we, as audience members, fall prey to there needing to be some sympathy for the opposing country. The British did unfairly treat the Irish in this film, but I believe any other director would have chosen a neutral ground instead of forging headfirst like Sheridan chose to do. I believe any other director would have focused more perversely on the courtroom drama aspect of this film instead of the compelling family epic that was being forged within the walls of Gerry's prison. Due to Sheridan, the masterpiece known as In the Name of the Father was crafted with genuine passion and superb direction.For a film of this high of emotion and intensity to work, there needed to be key players involved that knew how to handle the truthfulness of it all. Sheridan hit a bulls-eye with Daniel Day-Lewis in the key role of Gerry Conlon (which I think most directors do when they choose to hire one of our greatest cinematic heroes), but it was the surprise performance by the typical secondary character actor Pete Postlethwaite that shook me to the core. I have seen quite a bit of films that used the talent of Pete Postlethwaite, but I must admit, this is the first time that I have seen him take control of his character and give it his full devotion. Perhaps it was the dedication that Daniel Day-Lewis had to his character that rubbed onto the other actors, or again, maybe it was just the skillful direction of Jim Sheridan, but I will be the first to say that Postlethwaite stole this film. He didn't just capture the individual scenes in which he was present, but he embodied this entire film. Postlethwaite's father figure was there for his son, he put himself in danger for his son, and most importantly he taught his son the truth of the world. He was phenomenal in the small role that eventually captured the entire film. It is the belief of this reviewer that Pete should have been awarded for an Oscar for this role, instead of Tommy Lee Jones. I was also impressed with John Lynch whom I had only seen in some smaller roles since this. He fully embodied the frightened youth that didn't know better than to finger his friends to save his life. Then there was Emma Thompson. She was subtle in this film. Her role was short, sweet, and to the point, which I think is another prime example of why Sheridan's direction is so acute.I have not read Proved Innocent, but I do not think that Sheridan went too far off course with his adaptation. The story is what kept me glued to the screen. I knew from the awards that In the Name of the Father was honored with that it was great in the direction and acting respects, but it wasn't until I watched the entire film that I realized the power of the story. We don't watch Gerry grow up. We don't see his dysfunctional relationship with his father. We don't see the impeding chaos in Britain. We don't see a lot of back items that would have taken this film into the three-hour zone. Instead, Sheridan crops the film into three distinct moments. Those are Gerry prior to jail, Gerry and his father in jail, and finally, Gerry gaining the wisdom from his father. I enjoyed the fact that Sheridan didn't focus so intently on the trial, but instead the growth of Gerry and the developing relationship between him and father. It was like watching a child grow before our eyes. The only disappointment that I had with the overall story was the quickness of the ending. I do believe Sheridan could have traveled it out for another twenty minutes to give us the full effect of the climactic courtroom scene, or those moments when Gerry decides to learn about British law himself. I just felt that the last half-hour seemed to fly by because there were so many loose ends to tighten.Overall, I thought this film (despite the quickness of the ending) was engrossing to watch and exciting to see. It frightened me to watch it in a post-9/11 world because it makes us question our current government's hastiness to find answers and make executive decisions. It makes you wonder about the detainees of Iraq and if we, as a nation, are not discovering that our government is jailing the innocent. Sheridan successfully brings the emotions of aggravation and frustration to the peak of the screen with the events surrounding the Conlon family. He makes you feel for these innocent bystanders living in a corrupt nation. It made me happy to have the father that I currently have and appreciate the wisdom that he has handed down to me. Family is one of the most important elements in your life, and I believe that what Sheridan was trying to demonstrate with this film is that until you accept that, you will never find stability and security.Grade: **** out of *****",In the Name of the Father
47,TOMASBBloodhound,Terrorism hurts everyone.,8,18 February 2007,"In watching this fine film, on idea kept running though my mind. That being terrorism often hurts the innocent much more than the declared enemy. In the Name of the Father is a powerful, well-acted drama about terrorism and injustice. And also the love one man feels for his father. Some of the events in this film are factual, and others are not. Despite some liberties taken with history, the film still makes a strong point, however.Daniel Day-Lewis plays Gerry Conlon, a young man falsely accused along with several other friends and family members, of bombing a London pub in 1974. The bombing, performed by the IRA, killed a few persons and wounded several others. Conlon and his friends just happen to be near by when the bombing takes place. Through police torture, Conlon and his best friend confess to the crime, thinking a trial will exonerate them. Trouble is, there had been so many recent bombings that the legal system in Britain was just crying out for a scapegoat. Conlon and four friends are given life sentences. Several members of Conlon's family are also given stiff jail sentences. Even his own father who seems to be the most righteous and kind person imaginable and who never set foot in England at all during the time of the bombing!The film starts out like a shot from a cannon, as we see just how violent and chaotic Blefast was during the early seventies. Just living a normal life looked impossible. If the British troops weren't after you, then the IRA members were. The film also scores when we see Conlon head off to London to presumably make a better life for himself. He and a friend force themselves into a commune and enjoy a brief period of free love and decadence. The film gets very heavy once Conlon is arrested and tortured. And the last hour detailing his time behind bars is just plain somber. We watch his father just sort of waste away with him behind bars while an aggressive lawyer (Emma Thompson) fights to get them out. Pete Postletwaite is exceptional as Gerry's father, and seeing him grow sicker and weak is very difficult for the viewer. The film tries to shift gears down the stretch and show how Conlon has become determined and more radicalized, but these scenes are nothing spectacular. Even the conclusion seems a little anti-climatic, but at least we see some justice finally get done. The acting is very, very good. Lewis is as good as ever, and nobody looks out of their league. There are some historical liberties taken. Gerry and his father never actually lived in the same cell, for instance. Overall, this film will stick with you, though.In watching this film, one cannot help but feel for the victims of terrorism. I have personally not much knowledge of the conflict between the IRA and Britain, except to say that I'm well aware of how long and deep the scars run between the English and Irish peoples. That said, there is simply no excuse for terrorism. Look at how many victims that pub bombing created. Not only those who perished or were injured. That act of terror sent several innocent people to jail and ruined their lives! The British legal system is certainly to blame for sending the wrong people to jail, but would this have even happened if the IRA had not bombed that pub? A similar situation can be seen in the Middle East today. Radical Muslims look to strike out at Western interests, but their actions often hurt scores more other Muslims than any actual Western interests! Will we ever all learn to get along on this planet?8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",In the Name of the Father

Gerry Conlon of Belfast just happens to be in London with friends when a bomb explodes in a pub, killing innocent Britons. Although Conlon is innocent and the police have found a witness who corroborated his story, he is convicted of murder and sent to prison along with his friends and members of his family, considered accessories. Gerry and his father Giuseppe, an Irishman with an Italian first name, portrayed by Pete Postlethwaite, end up in prison together, and much of the film revolves around father-son conflict and eventual reconciliation prior to the father's death, hastened by abusive prison treatment. Eventually, a British lawyer (Emma Thompson) takes up their case and, by luck, discovers a file ""not to be shown to the defense"" which confirms that police found Conlon's witness and had his statement confirming Conlon's alibi. The prisoners are ordered released after 15 years while the police who gave false evidence against them are acquitted. The terrorism committed by the Irish Republican Army was deadly. Mistreatment of suspects by investigators was routine. And violation of the Rule of Law was forgiven by British juries. Unbelievable? Unfortunately not.",In the Name of the Father

Gerry Conlon, accused for being the leader, an innocent, angry young man becomes roommates with his own dad (who got sentenced as an accomplice), and a heartsick relationship evolves behind the bars. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Gerry, and Pete Postlethwaite his father Giuseppe Conlon, and both do extraordinary performances in capturing the relation between the two; the no-good petty thief Gerry sees everything he's demonstrating against in his father, a straightforward and careful elderly man who Gerry insists needs to start fighting back for all the unrighteousness in the world. The film is just as much about this father & son relationship as it is about the political war fought in Ireland, and it mixes those two ingredients masterfully and it makes for an engaging, provocative, tender and emotional experience in which we understand the many difficulties that faced the wrongfully accused convicts.

52,RonellSowes,Chaotic and frenzied,4,29 December 2020,"Daniel Day Lewis earned his second Academy Award nomination for his role in this film,which I feel is the closest the English-Irish Lewis ever came to playing himself. But that's just personal speculation. What is fact,however,is the importance of a good score. And except for iconic pieces like Star Wars or Jaws one never comprehends the importance of a good score until you've heard a bad one. Originally Chinatown had a different(and inferior) composer and after watching the film Robert Towne told Roman Polanski how his movie was being ruined by the score. Eventually Towne convinced him to change it and Jerry Goldsmith was hired to redo the music. Goldsmith's haunting score is so much of Chinatown's atmosphere and its contribution can hardly be overstated.
In The Name Of The Father could definetly have benefited from a different score too. But I will add that the music isn't the sole reason behind the film's chaotic and frenzied tone.",In the Name of the Father

However, I can't recall that I have seen a troubled father-son relationship (brought to life by astonishing performances from Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite) has been better depicted than in this. Just look at how the experience of imprisonment somehow matured Gerry up, whether by getting to know his father more and better (the dialogue between Gerry and Giuseppe is just phenomenal), or merely due to the incidents and mishaps that he had in prison. Not to mention the painful and provocative meticulous dramatization of a miscarriage of injustice, vividly portrayed by some of the most sensible, artistic, emotionally-charged scenery that Jim Sheridan's nuanced direction are responsible of.Happy Birthday to the greatest actor ever, Daniel Day-Lewis.

The film follows Gerry in prison and his fight to get him and his family out. Daniel Day-Lewis gives an incredible performance, while Pete Postelwaithe who plays his father is amazing in every scene.

The script then shifts to a prison chronicle — which turns out to be the real nature of the film — that blatantly lacks intensity and most importantly rhythm, a lot of scenes being not that pertinent. It is also regrettable that the movie is sometimes caricatural, for example with the trial scenes which aren't that well depicted.What to draw then from this film ? not much, only the good performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and especially Pete Postlethwaite, already dazzling at the time, manage to save the day.",In the Name of the Father
56,MikeyB1793,Excellent,9,5 March 2012,"An excellent drama with a very strong charismatic performance by Daniel Day Lewis who plays Gerry Conlon, an unemployed drifter. It starts in Northern Ireland and moves onto London where Gerry gets involved with another group of itinerants. He is then falsely arrested for the bombing of an English pub by the IRA, where a number of people are killed and maimed. He is sentenced to a long prison term erroneously, along with his father. It is all part of a nefarious plot by the British government to incarcerate any suspect to keep the British population content that something is being done about the bombings.Daniel Day-Lewis plays a complex character who is not entirely likable, but we do commiserate with his plight. At over 2 hours the movie never slows down. It's has tremendous conflict at all levels – in Ireland, the courtroom, the prison and the usual family father-son rivalries. It's based on a true story, but I have no idea regarding its authenticity. Highly recommended; particularly for those who love courtroom- prison dramas!",In the Name of the Father

The film itself is very political, as that is the nature of the story, and for that reason I could not bring myself to give it a higher star rating.

59,dead47548,A powerful story with one of the best performances of all time.,10,30 December 2007,"An emotionally wrenching and immensely powerful true story of an innocent man who is put in prison for fifteen years, after being forced by interrogators to sign a confession out of the threat that they'd kill his father if he didn't, and this man's fight to clear his name and his father's. Due to an incident with the IRA, Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) moves to London and after a chance opportunity to rob a prostitute he returns to his home in Belfast, coincidentally the day after a huge bombing committed by the IRA in London. His best friend, who was with him that night, Paul Hill is arrested and after being forced to confess with a gun in his mouth he lists Conlon and two other friends as members of the IRA. Now known as the Guildford Four, these innocent people were all sentenced to very lengthy jail sentences and, after painful torture, the government plants false accusations on members of Conlons' family including his father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite). Gerry has to deal with pent-up aggression that he has built up against his father for years while also trying to survive in a British prison as an accused IRA member.Even after Joe McAndrew (Don Baker) is arrested and confesses to the police that he was behind the Guildford bombing and the people they have in prison were innocent, Gerry and Giuseppe remain in prison suffering more and more by the day. Eventually Giuseppe begins working with Gareth Pierce (Emma Thompson) to investigate their case and prove the innocence of the Conlons and the other members of the Guildford Four. After Giuseppe dies of natural causes, Gerry gains a new drive to prove their innocence and takes over the task of working with Gareth. The film is a powerful character study of a man put under unimaginable circumstances and has the discipline to rise up and, along with Pierce, prove the innocence of not only himself but of his father and the other three members of the Guildford Four. It's an immensely heart-wrenching, emotional story that had me in tears several times throughout.Highlighting this sensational film is Daniel Day-Lewis who further proves that he is the greatest actor of all time and delivers what I believe is the best performance of his career. Taking on the role of Gerry Conlon requires the ability to subtly flow from a naive, immature young man to a disciplined adult working to clear the name of his father. Along that journey there are several highly emotional scenes that could have felt melodramatic or silly if another actor were portraying the man, but Day-Lewis brings a power to Conlon that no one else could. His brilliance is unparalleled. Pete Postlethwaite and Emma Thompson also deliver fantastic performances that rank among the best of the 90s. In the Name of the Father is a phenomenal film that studies the torture that one man had to go through due to the government and the journey he took to clear his name and the name of his father. It's the best film of 1993, in my eyes and Day-Lewis' portrayal is very high among the best performances of all time.",In the Name of the Father

This is the story about the Guildford Four, the story of four people who happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Once again London is haunted by an IRA-bomb and as the justice don't want to be blamed another time they must find some ""guilty"" and so it happens that some Irish outsiders are in the area of an exploded pub. The whole family of Conlon (even his father who must be so honest it reaches the laughable) are sent to prison at where they are absolutely hated and getting the hardest regime a prisoner can get. In the meantime the real terrorists are caught but the British government is too proud to convince that they made a mistake and little by little we see people torn apart as they are condemned for something they never did... Let's thank God this was a British production as never Sheridan chooses for Oscar-sentiment, it never goes over the top and it's just given as documentaryinformation, but mind you, the truth itself is shocking enough.

66,eshwarmail,Terrifying but biased premise with a superb performance by Pete Postlethwaite,8,1 December 2012,"A movie not without its flaws with a biased unidimensional perspective based on the biography by Gerry Conlon one of the accused from Guildford Four. While the overall story is commercialized and worked around for dramatic effect, Pete Postlethwaite's performance as the protagonist's father was too good in some scenes. Though it is competently performed, well written and executed, the battle is already half won with just the knowledge on the premise and the ordeal the Guildford four and Maguire seven have been through in real life. Based on real life events following Gerald Conlon ( Daniel Day-Lewis) a carefree wild youth who is accused of the Guildford bombing and imprisoned after coerced confession. This leads to arrests of his aunt's family infamously known as the Maguire Seven along with his father Guiseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), a just man trying to protect his son. After his father's death due to harsh prison environment and depression, he vows to fight back on the system with the help of a convinced lawyer Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson).The initial riot sequence was exhilarating pepped by a solid background score and hysterical atmosphere. The arrests, torture, trial and sentences leaves an emotional impact on the unjust treatment and fate of all the accused and some performances here are to be commended. But Pete Postlethwaite's portrayal of Conlon's father breaks the shackles, elevates the emotional depth in the movies and justifies the title. The initial scene where Guiseppe pleads the IRA men to forgive his son, the expression on his face when Gerald returns from England, the conversations inside the prison cell and the scene just before he dies are a few examples of his masterful performance. I can understand at a biographical point of view for a very biased approach, but as a movie which deals with other characters as well should have shown some elements of thoughts leading up to the characters in the system do what they do. Daniel Day-Lewis is reliable as ever playing a real-life character that goes through a transformation from an energetic wild youth to an introspective determined son.Terrifying but biased premise with a superb performance by Pete Postlethwaite",In the Name of the Father

69,harrylosborne,The English shown up for racists in a film for a change,7,12 April 2021,"Finally, something with Daniel Day-Lewis I didn't hate. As you look at the face of this man, convicted for a crime he didn't commit, you appreciate the qualities that have made him an Oscar-dominating actor.The Guildford pub bombing is a story eerily close to my home, but this isn't what I reacted to: more, the complete lack of morality and humanity of a legal system hell-bent on ruining the lives of a few people, just because of their nationality.Pete Postlethwaite is the standout: an actor I had only seen once (a brief but impactful showing in ""Inception""), he steals the show, playing the compassionate but conflicted father to Day-Lewis' roguish protagonist, an equally compelling character.The rest of the cast is decent, but sometimes stray into slight incredulity - this films is no doubt guilty for occasionally trying too hard for a laugh. Really, given a plot as sombre as this, I would expect slightly more gravitas to be afforded. The settings are unique: the courtroom is compelling (cramped but swelling with vibrancy), and the prison and Ireland both set a great scene. All are bright and give a bit of life, particularly in a genre that would so readily devolve to dark and pessimistic settings.Story-wise, the delicate balance of the IRA and a nervy England is palpable, expressed through the anxieties of the police and the public. This creates a consistent drama that explains the story's direction, but also makes the xenophobia even more disgusting.""In the Name of the Father"" is bleak. It paints England in a harsh, unforgiving light, such is the injustice it seeks to pile on Ireland, solely on the reputation of a violent few.This tension, probably representing the national sentiment of the time, is delivered effectively and continuously, in a film that is a slow but effective judicial burner.",In the Name of the Father
70,Christopher_Reid,"Great performances, powerful movie.",9,21 October 2007,"It's funny how you can watch a whole bunch of movies, trying to learn more about film-making and how shots are constructed, how characters are developed, how music should be used and then all of a sudden a movie comes along and you find yourself drawn into its story and easily forgetting to pay attention to all of technical aspects. When it comes to In the Name of the Father, it was like being reminded of how powerful a performance could be and how films can truly reach into your heart and affect you.I don't know what makes Daniel Day-Lewis' performance so effective but I thought it was very much so. I think great film is often about capturing the great things that already exist in the world, not so much about creating a great work of art but recognising something that you find beautiful or simply interesting and sharing it with an audience. Perhaps the reason Day-Lewis' performance is so good is that he is so ""naked"" as an actor (as they say). I have a feeling this is probably some well known concept in film that critics rarely talk about because everyone understands it (except me). Oh well.I also though Pete Postlethwaite and Emma Thompson were excellent as well, one gets the impression that everyone that worked on the film truly believed in it. As for the story, I have no idea how close it is to the truth but to some degree I don't think it matters. What matters is that it manages to engage and affect you, hence inspiring you to learn more about the actual events for yourself. I don't think films should have to be about capturing or creating realism only, by exploring fantasies you can make things more personal as well as achieve greater depth (I believe) hence expressing more than you could otherwise. This probably has little to do with this film in particular but as Roger Ebert has said (roughly), movies should be about emotions and ideas not facts.So, I think what makes In the Name of the Father so effective is that its a personal film with a very talented cast, a good story and a director that knows how to let the magic happen. Or something. I think that's an extremely vague and general statement but hey, I don't want to spoil the details of the story.",In the Name of the Father
71,fostrhod,Spoilers included,9,1 May 2021,"In the Name of the Father (1993) Daniel Day Lewis , Pete Postlewaite , Emma Thompson. A film about the "" Guildford Four"", four alleged IRA terrorists and their subsequent life imprisonment for the bombing of a pub in Guildford in 1974. My expectations weren't very high as the film began with the usual scenes of the streets of Belfast with its squaddies instigating and squashing the rioting catholics. Cut to a fleeing Daniel Day Lewis to a hippy commune in London, all pretty obvious. Then the bomb, and the English media, police and public baying for blood. Day Lewis is arrested sent down for life.....after confessions are brutalised out of him by the police and evidence falsified to incriminate his father and family they are also found guilty.... for being Irish in the wrong place at the wrong time...then real IRA bomber confesses. Following a long protracted fight for innocence they eventually get pardoned and released. I'm obviously skimming over what is both a wonderful film and a disgusting chapter in British history. Great acting from all concerned. The relationship between the father and son, Day Lewis and Postlewaite excel here. I can't do justice ( no pun intended) to any of the real innocent people involved, both victims of the bombing or the Guildford Four by writing a review of a film.

75,jcanettis,"Extremeley Powerful, With Superb Performances",10,2 September 2005,"A film fully deserving to be in IMDb's top 250, Jim Sheridan's ""In The Name of the Father"" is an excellent piece of work. Based on a true and very touching story, the film recounts the story of Gerry Conlon (Day-Lewis) who is wrongly accused as an IRA terrorist. Not only are the police bending the facts to prove their case, but in the process they also implicate members of his friends and family, including his father Giuseppe (Postlethwaithe) whose health condition is rather frail. Gerry is a rebellious and mildly delinquent boy who does not seem to have grown up, and his attitude toward his father is not the appropriate one; however, as they start to go through the ordeal together, Gerry gradually matures, and starts feeling a deep affection and respect for Giuseppe.The story is heart-breaking and shocking at the same time, all the more so when one realizes that these things actually DID happen. Although there have been some minor modifications for the purpose of the film, the backbone of the story is left completely intact.The two protagonists, Daniel Day-Liewis and Pete Postlethwaithe are delivering powerful performances, and they both deserved the Oscar hands-down. However, it would be unfair not to mention that virtually everyone in the film is great in his/her role.Jim Sheridan's direction is also very good, giving the plot a fair and balanced perspective; although the film might initially appear as pro-Irish / anti-English, in fact I consider it as quite objective. Granted, it vividly shows that some key figures in the London police were profoundly biased and manipulated maliciously the case against the Conlons; yet, it also shows that English public attitudes turned highly supportive for the Conlons' freedom when it started to become clear that they were not the culprits for the atrocities they had been charged with. We have always to remember that the film depicts a period of big tensions, with emotions running high to levels of hysteria, so we have to understand the events within this context.Of course, what happened to the Conlons is totally deplorable and unjustifiable; and it is real shame that the people who conspired against them have not been punished yet for their crimes. Still, one should understand the hostile attitude shown by those who were not part of this conspiracy (such as the judge, for example), who were influenced by the climate of terror and the outrage of the public. The Conlons had the terribly bad luck to be at the wrong place, in the wrong time, and with the wrong nationality; the also have the great misfortune to be captured by people who in their quest to show results were shamelessly willing to risk indicting people who could possibly be innocent.""In the Name of the Father"" is a fantastic film, which one should not miss. 10/10.",In the Name of the Father
76,vishal_wall,Our Legal system rots because people don't empathize,9,2 August 2006,"Gerry Conlon is a small time thief and happy-go-lucky man in Ireland. He attracts a lot of attention of the Britian occupied Ireland authorities and IRA because of his loud behavior. Gerry's father, Guisseppe, sends his son to Britain thinking it would be a little less dangerous for his accident prone son. Little does he know that Gerry's behavior will result in Gerry, his friends and himself landing up in the jail falsely accused of planting bombs. Police tortures and makes a scapegoat out of this bunch of innocent people. Guissepe dies in the jail fighting against the ruling with a lawyer, Gareth Peirce. It takes 14 years for the court to dismiss the case against the innocent people. Based on a true story. Its a very thought provoking film. This film reminds me of a very good Indian film 'Andha Kanoon'(Blind Law). There is a fantastic line in the title track of the film which says ""Jail Main Kitne Log Sade, Sooli Pe Nirdosh Chadhe""(so many innocent people have rotted in the Jails and hung on the line). That exactly is the theme of this film. I rented this film to understand the IRA conflict but this film taught me more than that. It is so scary to see people dwelling in the jail for the crimes they have not committed. This film is an example that we are goofed up as human beings and not as Indians or Americans or Britishiers. Every Country has a legal system which can be manipulated and used by influential people. It raises the same age old question again ""Is the legal system working for human beings?"". My answer to that is ""Its not"". Indian philosophy behind the legal system is ""better ten guilty men go free rather than one innocent man die"". This philosophy is just as good as ""love thy neighbors"" and is practically as feasible. All countries have problems with their neighboring countries and thousands dwell in the jails because no one cared to fight for their freedom. Our legal system need drastic changes. I think the only way is UN but UN itself needs a lot of reformations. A very well deserved 7 Oscars nominations. Why Didn't get a single finally?. Simple. There was Schindler's list and obviously any anti-Hitler or anti-Stalin film is an all Oscar winner. Remember Hitler was an imperialist and England and America dropped an H-bomb for the freedom of the mankind? Daniel Day-Lewis as Gerry is very good. Pete Postlethwaite as Guisseppe is also very good. I think the biggest challenge for the director was to show 35 years old Daniel Day lewis a young Gerry Conlon and then about 40 years old during the trial. I think Daniel, make-up crew and cameraman did a fantastic job in that area. Pete was just wonderful when he played an unhealthy old man. Very good acting. Riot scenes were very well done and 'Voodoo child' really worked. This was my first Emma Thompson film. All the reviews I read before the watching the film were written as if Emma was the central character. She obviously is a good actor but I don't understand what was that euphoria about. I went online to check if she is a 'Paris Hilton' kind of celebrity (people you can never figure out what they actually do) but even that was not true.

It could have been a clichéd exploitation of a complicated horrible situation, but rather is exceptionally subtle, nuanced and original, and therefore, very powerful. Some people comment that it plays a little loose with facts, some of which are not so minor. That the film makes no mention of Gerry Conlon's possible, if doubtful, ties to the IRA does change things a bit. Including that info would only have made the film better, more subtle. But its omission does help us to see Gerry Conlon as unjustly accused, tortured and convicted, avoiding the distraction of our suspecting him a criminal terrorist. Daniel Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaithe are riveting as living, breathing, flesh and blood characters, almost bigger and better than the story itself.

As father and son Giuseppe and Gerry Conlon, both Pete Postlethwaite and Daniel Day-Lewis give passionate and outstanding performances as they struggle with both their failed relationship and the battle to prove their innocence. Emma Thompson gives a strong performance too as lawyer Gareth Peirce, the woman who has taken up the appeal. All other cast members are impressive. Sheridan presents a highly charged, emotional drama which tells a horrifying tale in what is a black period in Irish and English history that continues even today. While he perhaps could have shown us more of the people's reaction and the feeling of the time, he instead concentrates on the Conlon's plight and their never ending fight for justice. Due credit must also go to Jim Sheridan for keeping what would have to be an incident and an issue that is close to his heart, very evenly balanced, as both sides are portrayed as equally guilty of terrible and unspeakable acts.Backed up by some very good cinematography, editing and set direction, ""In the Name of the Father"" is certainly a movie that will stir your soul and disturb you.

85,suvopyne49,No less great than 'The Shawshank Redemption',10,17 December 2011,"Some times you watch a movie and tell yourself ""Why I haven't seen this movie before?"". This is exactly that kind of a movie. The movie is said to be a bit blurred in historical accuracies. Probably, that is the reason the movie is a bit underrated. The things that make this movie a winner is its simple yet strong story and immeasurably powerful performances. The movie is about Gerry Conlon and his three friends, the team of whom was later christened as the ""Guildford Four"". They were falsely accused of bombing and killing. This was followed by multiple arrests, including those of Gerry's Aunt and Father, Giuseppe. Full credit to Jim Sheridan for handling the plot in an appropriate way by following a linear narrative. It is the credit of the director for showing the unique bond between Gerry and Giuseppe, which I am quite sure can be related by any father-son pair. About performances; when there is Daniel Day Lewis, as Gerry, there will be impeccable and majestic acting. I always fall short of adjectives when I talk about Day-Lewis' acting. Be that when he got the news of his father's death or in the climax or any other single scene featuring him, he excelled. Pete Poslethwaithe was also brilliant as Giuseppe and got matched Day-Lewis' acting. Emma Thompson, always a fantastic actress, didn't disappoint and was excellent especially in the last climax courtroom scene. Special mention to Don Baker as Joe McAndrew.As a final note this is a movie which, as its fantastic soundtrack 'In the Name of the Father"" by U2 indicates, tells a story about love,humanity and fighting for truth and those make this movie no less great than The Shawshank Redemption.",In the Name of the Father
86,mokshjuneja,In the Name of Daniel Day-Lewis,8,7 March 2009,"Was looking at this cover of the DVD that i was planning to rent out, I see, there is this man who looks very similar to Daniel Day Lewis staring at me with a intense looks. First reminded of the music album covers that were produced of individual artists.But then seen There will be Blood, picked up In the Name of the Father which is a serious and not to be taken lightly movie. A little background of the IRA and the Great Britain, will surely help while watching the movie.There were scenes where in i was lost in between cause of very heavy British accent. Sometimes the abusive language was so empowering that you enjoy watching the what you are watching, but you miss on the dialogues.One thing which completely hats off to the man - Daniel Day Lewis, he can actually take the whole movie all by himself. He stays in the character, he does what he needs to do to be in the character and completely shows on screen which he has a very strong presence.At the same time, not to forget Pete who plays Gerry's father and they share the same prison cell in the movie. Something that which I had seen for the first time and it was a little difficult for me to digest that father - son sharing the same prison. Pete in his own way played the role model of the good father who wants to inculcate good habits in his son, but fails. Even his death scene who intensely dramatic and clearly showed that how this would change his son. Then the movie picks up the pace.on Emma Thompson, probably i was too enamored by the Daniel Day-Lewis' performance, her role was kind of over shadowed. Not saying that she didn't have a commanding role, she was the lawyer, defending falsely accused of terrorist activity.This movie is not for the faint heartened, its not horror movie. But at the same time, it is really good movie to watch out for, when you are hoping to watch good cinema.

And I don't even think it has intentions of being it, but rather making a statement on the Northern Ireland conflict, about the UK, and about democratic legal system's as a whole. And above all, it wants to make Gerry Conlon's story reach a wider audience. I seriously cannot believe what happened to him, it's completely outrageous and it really makes you think about the whole idea of Justice, judges, juries, laws, police and so on. Besides the story, which is good (and even better when you keep in the back of your mind that it really happened), the best of this movie is Daniel Day-Lewis' acting. He is probably the best living actor, I'd dare to say. Since it's the earliest movie I've seen of him, I seriously thought that he's actually Irish and that only later he learned to do other accents.

90,RagingDraugr,"Not great, but good.",7,5 November 2018,"In The Name Of The Father is a good movie. Not great, but good. After all, it has a lot going for it: great acting (particularly from its headlining stars: Day-Lewis, Postlethwaite and Thompson), solid and assured direction as well as, obviously, a thought-provoking story about four individuals who were wrongly imprisoned for over 15 years for a crime they did not commit (as well as seven others sent to prison on separate charges). But belying these good aspects, is an over-simplified, poorly-paced and sometimes confusing version of the truth. The story that's being told of the 'Guildford Four' can be perplexing at times, largely because of the pacing and editing of the film. Characters are introduced in some scenes which leave you going ""Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?"", before it clicks much later on in the film who they are and what those scenes were about - and not in a good way. I'm sure a second or third viewing may clear up some of those aspects for me, but it usually doesn't speak well of a film if you're going back to watch it just you can understand what happened fully - rather than re-watching it to try and catch details you missed and/or analyse the film more closely.In addition, despite the lengthy run-time, the story is dreadfully slow and out of balance at times. For example, Thompson barely seems to appear in the film, and seeing more of what she did to try and get the Guildford Four out of prison would have been compelling. The out-of-kilter pacing also led to some strange moments i.e. we're told about Guiseppe, Gerry's father, leading a campaign to try and get them free; the result of which we only see in the last 15-20 minutes of the film. Much like Thompson's rare appearances, it would have been nice to see more of this, rather than merely being told it, and how it came about rather than seemingly going from 0 to 100 in the blink of an eye.In short, the over two hour run-time should have been cut down and streamlined, and could have almost definitely benefited from adjusting the story beats significantly. There are other issues with the editing such as (at least) two noticeably dubbed over lines, and (on a lesser note) unimpressive and boring opening and closing credits (not really that much of a negative, but I thought I'd point it out regardless). Because of these aforementioned issues, I can't give this film an overwhelmingly positive score despite its merits. I therefore sentence 'In The Name Of The Father' to a 7/10, with a possible re-review in the future to consider any other possibilities that may have been missed.Court is adjourned.",In the Name of the Father
91,mulhollandman,An addictive story with breath taking performances make for a quality film,8,11 September 2006,"In the name of the father is the story of Gerry and Giuseppe Conlon, a father and son who along with nine other innocents, were wrongly accused and convicted in relation to the Guildford Bombings in 1974. Gerry Conlon became apart of a group that were known world wide as the Guildford Four and Giuseppe became apart of a group that were lesser known as the Maguire Seven. In the Name of the Father is set during the time that relations between England and Ireland were most strained.The film begins in 1974 Belfast and it immediately establishes Gerry's character as a tearaway. He is a tearaway for many reasons too many to list in this comment but it is evident that one of the reasons that he refuses to lie down and become like his father. His father Giuseppe is a likable man. A loving father whose hard work to provide for his family during a time where Catholics had no rights results in him developing severe asthma. When Gerry is blamed with his friends Paul Hill, Paddy Armstrong and Carol Richards for the Guildford Pub bombing, Giuseppe drops everything and goes to London to help his son. When staying with his relations the Maguire's he is also picked up and charged with them for being involved in Terrorist activity. They are found guilty and sentenced. Gerry receives life and Giuseppe get 14 years. While in prison the turbulent relationship between Gerry and his father worsens to the point where they are not speaking. Despite their natural stormy relation ship this situation is worsened by the arrival of Joe McAndrew who is the real Guildford Bomber. In McAndrews, Gerry sees the man who his father should be. A man that is a fighter and who does not take things lying down as opposed to quiet conservative Giuseppe who has turned his cheek all his life and has been repaid in bad health for it. But as time goes by and maturity sets in, Gerry revises his opinion on Giuseppe and discovers that he always will have a friend in his father. The final chapter sees Gerry discarding his troublesome persona in favor of one that is similar to his fathers and together begin to fight to clear their names.This film was Jim Sheridan's first in relation to the situation that had engulfed Northern Ireland and to be honest it is his best so far. Sheridan once again uses an addictive storyline (father and son in miscarriage of justice) to further investigate the theme of father/son relations. Despite it's political setting and use of ethnic sides to tell the story what Sheridan wants us to asses is the relationship between Gerry Conlon and his father and how Gerry's resistance to become like his father leads to his downfall but it is through the worst part of his life that he gets to know his father properly. Through the claustrophobic atmosphere of their prison cell Gerry realizes that he has more in common with his father and despite past arguments Giuseppe becomes not only his father again but his best friend.Day-Lewis is on form yet again with his performance and I have yet to see him in a film where he does not give a solid performance. This time he has the very strong support from Postlewaithe as his father Giuseppe. Postlewaithe is superb as the ill Giuseppe who never gives up hope. Emma Thompson is someone I have been very keen on. But in this film she delivers a spectacular performance and like Posthlewaithe it is worthy of the Oscar nomination they received and in both cases they should have won. Sheridan must also be praised for his script and direction of this film. He took a story that at the time was still sore on the minds of both the Irish and British people. It was also a time where the situation in Northern Ireland looked as if it would never stop and the films release could further the cause of fighting for both paramilitary sides. It did however make the world sit up and pay attention because every country has had at some time a severe miscarriage of justice.If you want facts about the cases of the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven I suggest you don't watch this film. At the time of it's release it was heavily accused of not painting an accurate description of the case but the reality is that if you want details the film would not run at just over two hours but it would run for 15 years. I suggest you ask your local television stations to commission a Docu-Drama. This story is about the Conlon's. If I had faults with it I would say that my biggest hate of this film is the republican bomber Joe McAndrews. It is a very wooden performance that is down to bad acting and nothing else. He is too open about the whole affair which leaves a very bad taste in my mouth. If all Republican terrorists talked and acted like this the troubles of Northern Ireland would have lasted 10 minutes. There is a saying in Ireland that those who talk about it, no the least about it. On a whole it is very unbelievable. But despite this the film is very good, hard going to watch and very hard to walk away from without having some emotions evoked inside you. 8 out of 10.",In the Name of the Father

By exploring a very controversial issue, this enthralling drama proves to be a very eye-opening and thought provoking viewing experience, one that is both politically and morally charged. Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite give extremely passionate performances, as they serve as the centerpiece for a film that strikes a strong balance between exploring the estranged father-son relationship and the surrounding political issues.

94,martinmcdonough,Absolutely dreadful.,3,30 May 2014,"Many reviews say that words cannot accurately describe this movie, and they would be correct. I, however, will give it a try. I first saw this movie some 20+ years ago and I found it to be a long, plodding, go- nowhere film where the outcome was predictable from the start and unraveled so formulaic it could have spewed from the powerbook of the laziest Hollywood hack. It was over-acted at numerous times, some of the conversations were simply not believable (did George Lucas write some of this dialogue?) and there were too many unnecessary close-ups for dramatic effect. Having not read the book (as I was unaware at the time I first viewed it that there was one) and no knowledge of the individuals or events that would comprise the film, the filmmakers needed to do a better job of having viewers care about the characters, their struggles, and their fates. Instead, I found the film to be preachy (can't stress that enough), one-sided and ultimately boorish. Fast forward 20 years.Recently, I had the opportunity to view this film again and thought that maybe 20 years of maturity on my part would let me see this film through a different lens and possibly appreciate (at the very least) the intention of the filmmakers. This time was, indeed, different. I was in my house and in control of the remote. After 20 minutes, I just couldn't take it anymore.

95,what3v3r,An injustice that still reverberates,10,16 March 2005,"""In the Name of Father"" is the one of the greatest movies ever to be filmed. It is based on a true story about an injustice of mammoth proportions committed against four innocent individuals. The corrupt roots of the law enforcement poison the lives and psyches of Paul Hill, Gerry Conlon, Paddy Armstrong, Carole Richardson popularly known as 'The Guildford Four'. Among others including Gerry' father , The Guildford Four are sentenced to imprisonment for a crime they didn't commit. The movie is a painful journey through the lives of these four until their kith and kin manage to garner sufficient public voice and evidence leading to their eventual release. Gerry loses his father to the cruelties of prison life which poignantly portrays the resignation of innocence. A determined lawyer , energetically played by Emma Thompsonm, finally manages to secure the release of the four after 15 years of suffering and trauma. But 15 years is a behemoth of a price for a little indiscretion on part of the judicial system.Although I will confess to being a self-absorbed individual , this movie made me wanna fight for The Guilford Four cause. Apparently, the events have been doctored only slightly to suit move making. The fact that a British Prime Minister offered an apology is but an epitome as to how entrenched the tragedy was. The bearing that the 15 years might have had on the psyche of the individuals is unfathomable. After I watched the movie , I spent hours contemplating on Gerry Conlon and the loss he suffered.Daniel Day Lewis is simply stunning . Not only does he carry the film, he makes it the masterpiece that it is. The supporting cast aren't far behind either. And Emma Thompson just bursts into the scene with great fervor. The soundtrack was pretty impressive too , particularly the score by Sinead 'O Connor. With all this behind such a stunning piece of art , the Academy' move in 1993 puzzled me.

106,CoolClones,A true miscarriage of justice,10,28 July 2003,"In the name of the father is an excellent film. It tells the true story of Gerry and Guiseppe Conlon who where jailed as members of the so called ""Guilford Four"" who allegedly where guilty of bombing packed public houses back in the 70's.Britain in the mid 70's was falling victim to many such bombings orchestrated by the Provisional IRA and the English Police where desperate for a result.Then along come Gerry Conlon and his friend Paul Hill, two Irish teenagers who have left Belfast for London after being banished by the local IRA for theiving. The IRA, especially in Belfast, look down upon criminal behaviour in their neighbourhoods as it brings unwanted police attention. These guys where chancers and thieves, NOT terrorists.The Police arrest them, again in the act of burgalry and charge them with the said act of terrorism even though they have a concrete aliby for their location at the time of the bombing. They are beaten and threatened until they sign blank confessions. Gerry's father, Guiseppe, made his way to London to help his son. On his arrival he is arrested by the Police as the Terrorist mastermind behind the bombings. His poor relatives, who lived in London who he was staying with, where all arrested as the police established the small house as a ""bomb factory"".The Police manufactured the charges and then got greedy. The family in the so called ""bomb factory"" ALL went to prison for 12 years, even the children went into young offenders prisons as terrorists. Gerry, Guiseppe, Paul Hill and a young girl they had met on the day in question, all went to prison as Terrorists for 30 years terms.About 15 years later, Guiseppe became terminally ill and the Conlon's where given permission to secure a lawyer (the first REAL legal representation they received under anti-terrorism laws). Gerry and Guiseppe convince her (played brilliantly by Emma Thompson) of their innocence.Then, as if by a miracle, she is issued a warrant to see the files on Guiseppe's case in order to appeal for his release for ill health. The warrant reads - G. Conlon. The clerk at the records office asks if she wishes to see Gerry's or Guiseppe's file. Seizing her chance she takes Gerry's file.In this file, she finds a statement confirming Gerry's aliby with a hand written note attached signed by the Police officer in charge of the case stating that this document was ""Not to be shown to the defence"".The case went back to court and all parties where freed because the case was thrown out in MINUTES. The Police officer who framed all involved retired from the service on health grounds and was never brought to justice.This film damns the British Justice system in a way seldom seen before on film. It does not in any way glamourise the IRA or is it ""out to get"" the British Government or the Crown Prosecution Service. It simply tells the story of people who where in the wrong place at the wrong time. These people had their lives destroyed just so the police could say that they had caught the Guilford bombers - who where never found.Serious stuff!",In the Name of the Father

There are good cops but also bad ones who either don't care if they arrest the wrong people or who intentionally do. There are bad judges and juries and prosecutors who want more notches in their legal belts more than they want justice.Both the US and England have seriously flawed criminal justice systems. It is hard for me to believe I ever believed otherwise. Good cops and good lawyers and decent judges need to challenge ones who are not. They need to speak out and dare to tell the truth about the corruption in the system instead of cowardly hiding their heads in the sand.From personal experience I know of a tragic wrongful conviction and have heard of others through my work and education.This film along with others such as Hurricane Hunters are wake-up calls to citizens who want some semblance of honesty in the judicial process.

The film is clear in it's position and focuses on this angle, keeping many of the judicial complications to a minimum and works well because of it.  Demonstrating the closeness that can be between people achieved against tremendous adversity and condemnation.As a direct result of this, the film suffers from the factual angle, mainly because Gerald and Giuseppe were never actually imprisoned together. However, other than this, the story seemed to stay fairly close to the main historical facts surrounding the Guildford 4 trial and should be commended for trying to inform about this tragic happening, rather than glorify it in order to attract viewers.All in all, Jim Sheridan and everyone who worked on this film should feel proud of what they have created, a film which informs and entertains both as a factual account of events and as a tale of tolerance and acceptance both socially and within the family unit.",In the Name of the Father
112,iraava,Nearly perfect,9,12 June 2020,"With a tad more time and less drive to drive points, having wiped off a few Hollywood-cliches that had a slightly odorous tack (I'm Spartacus, anyone?) this would've been a bullseye. But it's quite close. The acting is stellar, the suspense tangible, storystelling's largely great, there's a few giggles, there's heart and the pain Day-Lewis portrays feels true enough to give the chills. The viewer can't help but emote.The problem of the film is largely trying to find the gravitas of the stolen 15years in such a short amount of time. Fitting so many other characters, devergent plot lines and events into this short of space makes it at time seem less jail and more summer camp. Granted that it is hard to make time move without a montage of some sort, a bit less hurried approach with less subplots could've kicked it from the Rita Hayworth into The Trial.Nevertheless it's a great movie and a chilling story that is amongst the very few that actually deserves to be described kafkaesque.

I also feel the director pushed too hard for the audience to be sympathetic towards Gerry Conlon and spent more time telling about his torture then on his time trying to secure his freedom. Then the death of his father, Giuseppe you feel as though he didn't care and that the inmates cared more about him then Gerry did. Then in the end you see that the ones responsible never were charged with the bombing and that the police who chorused the confessions didn't have to face any kind of consequences for their actions.",In the Name of the Father

119,diarma_10,A deep and powerful movie,8,13 February 2008,"I've seen this movie a few times now and each time I watch it, I get more and more sucked into it.Its one of these films that Jim Sheridan has opted for the right man to play Gerry Conlon, it just doesn't seem that anyone else but Daniel Day Lewis could have pulled this off. His posture, his accent, his mannerism, he just pulled off the character of a mischievous petty thief.The entire story of how they are convicted just because they are Belfast boys in London who happen to be around on the night of the pub bombing, then held for 7 days and nights under new legislation, beaten and torchered to the point the easiest way to end it all is to sign a confession to something they never done, its all very realistic and you feel part of it.The court room scene as they are being convicted, both the Guilford 4 & Maguire 7 is one of the most touching scenes I've seen in a movie, just knowing that there are 11 folk, completely innocent, watching a Crown Lawyer sit and tell a jury of how they were involved in explosives and the murder of innocent people when the truth is every last piece of evidence against them is a lie, it actually gets you on the verge of rage. Think of it in context like this, all 11 members who were trialled and imprisoned totalled 120 years combined for something they were not even remotely involved in. This is what makes the said Court Room scene more thrilling.The way the English police are portrayed into being completely anti Irish due to the ongoing current political circumstances is sickening, it really makes me despise how Governmental bodies worked in those days and it gives you the idea that similar occurrences probably do happen in modern times.I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be sucked into a film for over 2 hours.

At some point i understand them, but most of them tried to bring some historical ""facts"" and rumours to damage this movie. There were some others who was trying to catch some mistakes in the movie. The were saying things that doesn't change anything really, for instance: It doesn't really matter where Gerry and Hill met, it doesn't matter if they were at some time in some groups or how they have become the suspects. These things doesn't change the whole idea, but when you sometimes make movies you just have to make some changes. There were some other people who was trying to state they were not innocent, they did some other things, robbery and so on. They are wrong too, it doesn't matter what else they did in any other place. This movie is focusing on Guildford Bombing, this movie is focusing on people who ere jailed that have nothing to do with that bombing. So, they were innocent in this case. The stayed in prison for 15 years. That is very unfair and the such an embarrassing story for England. I am sorry, but it is. For my point of view this movie is underrated because of people who didn't like it. They rated this movie considering many other things that have nothing to do with this movie. When i rate movie, i only consider movie. This movie is well directed with great performances! I was not bored when i was watching the movie.

This film shows him and his father from their time in Belfast to their prison sentence. Daniel Day Lewis gives an unsurprisingly good performance but the crown goes to Pete Postlethwaite in his role as Patrick ""Giuseppe"" Conlon, Paul's father.

You get the feeling:""It could so easily have been me, since they were just looking for some Irish people to set up.""Despite criticisms that the screenwriters rejigged parts of the story to make them more dramatic (and to edit a few details that might have distracted attention from the main story - after all, real life is messier than the movies) I don't remember similar criticisms when history was rewritten to make it more dramatic in films like Zulu, Rorkes's Drift, Young Winston or Lawrence of Arabia, which tend to fit better into the British imperial self-image.A highly political film, but still highly effective on a personal level.

And, Daniels character, throughout the beginning of the film, hurt himself, and his father, along with the rest of the people he knew, by simply being selfish and immature. As I said, a real character flaw in a lot of people in the world. He refused to see, that the people, he thought were ""in the right"", would use him too, in the struggle for power. And, while imprisoned, his maturity grew. Sadly at the cost of his father. He saw that it was only about a power struggle from the 2 sides. And, finally realized, his father and him had nothing to do with it. And his father who would fight for his son, and family. Not for the glory of power. But the love of his family. Was truly, the strongest person, around him. Daniel Day, was awesome in this movie, for portraying, a stubborn immature, character, who completely matured, albeit, very late.

There are also moments of goodness and evil on both sides of the ""war"", moments of weakness with terrible consequences.

I have to disagree. The British legal system is portrayed badly (and rightly so) but there are good and bad individuals in every society. The British are also shown protesting in the streets and supporting the wrongly accused Guildford Four, and it is a British woman who brings justice to the individuals.

144,willisd,Brilliant commentary that is 100% relevant today,9,28 March 2007,"This is an exceptional movie, and a deeply political one. Not just for its discussion of Northern Ireland, but the very poignant statements it makes about torture, about the death penalty, and indeed about any system of justice that prioritizes attaining a confession of guilt.More than a decade since the film came out, all of these issues are highly relevant in, for example, the United States today.Guantanamo Bay, anyone? As this film makes clear, there is no justification for the torture of political prisoners (or indeed, anyone else for that matter).The Death Penalty? Had the UK permitted the death penalty for this sort of crime, the Guildford Four would almost certainly have been executed (both the film and the contemporaneous accounts of the case indicate this). There can be no justification for capital punishment, under any circumstances. Guilt is never 100% certain, even when accompanied by a confession.It's rare that a film makes compelling, timeless political statements, and rarer still to do so in the context of telling a great story. The story of Gerry Conlon, and the rest of the Guildford Four, needs to be told and retold. Especially in times when people are willing to sacrifice human freedoms and fundamental rights in the hopes of attaining a false sense of ""security.""",In the Name of the Father

A petty thief sure... but a murderer? They had no hardcore evidence and judging from the film the police looked as though they were just doing a 9-5 working day shift.Day-Lewis who was just brilliant and is always brilliant in his films captured Conlon to the bone.The story is such a tale of injustice and the only reason he was put in jail is because he was Irish.I am so glad that this film was made as it finally reflects to the world what England were really like to the Irish.

After several hours of torture and torment, Gerry is forced to sign confessions and, eventually be sent to jail along with his family for the accused making of the bomb.A great father-to-son relationship is developed throughout the Conlon's time in prison. However, when Gerry's father, Guiseppe, dies in prison for something he didn't do, the audience sympathises with the emotions of Gerry and the burning pieces of paper floating down the prison walls acts as a metaphor for the loss of the innocent.One again, a marvellous film with tells the story of one family fighting for Justice",In the Name of the Father

150,pvarma,An inspiring account of a man's struggle against injustice.,10,13 May 2001,"`In the Name of the Father' is one of the three co-ventures of Jim Sheridan and Daniel Day-Lewis. In terms of story, spirit and performance, I will put it in league with `My Left Foot', their first venture as a director-actor team. I rate this film 10 out of 10, for reasons I go on to explain:`In the Name of the Father' is an account of the true saga of an Irish man, Gerry Conlon, who is wrongfully imprisoned for life. He and his family are made scapegoats by the police and legal system for the bombing of the Guildford Pub of London in 1974. The film goes on to show the bitter trial of Conlon, his father and 3 of his companions accused in the case, and Conlon's spirit as he faces the brutality of unfair imprisonment, and his inimitable spirit as he attempts to reopen the case after 15 years with the aid of a lawyer, Gareth Pierce.One thing I absolutely love about the film is the performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite. By virtue of being inspired from a true story, the film has a very strong theme and story line. The evolution of the relationship between Gerry and his Dad, Giuseppe has been shown beautifully. The evolution of Gerry from a quick tempered, riotous fellow to a person who has mellowed down and whom time in prison has transformed into a patient man, has also been depicted rather well. The fact that the guy wrongfully accused of a terrorist bombing is not a Godly and perfect sort of guy, but instead a riotous guy given to petty thieving, prevents the film from becoming didactic and overly dramatic. But I guess this is because the director and writer have been true to the real life story of Gerry Conlon.I have no hesitation in stating that `In the Name of the Father' is one of the best films I have seen.",In the Name of the Father
151,mc134,The best movie ever made!!!,10,9 June 2001,"I have now seen this movie like 20 times, and its absolutely great! - Daniel Day-Lewis makes an outstanding performance, he should have got a Oscar for it. There are a few things in the movie that are added for the excitement to the story, so its not 100% true, but its okay, its only minor things to keep the viewer attached to the screen. If you want the real story read the book which is also very very good. Its a very special movie, which not will be forgotten - its leaves you absolutely breathless...thinking how could this have happened?",In the Name of the Father

Everyone is entitled to voice an opinion , and voice them u must! I hasten to add, a persons comment reading (entertainment) this was not made for entertainment but education! This injustice is happening all over the world and until documented films such as this one is brought to light , then everyone remains none the wiser! The film cannot be as perfect as maybe mentioned, but can only be as realistic as it possibly can be! The actors portrayed the characters as fantastically as they could. I hope this film becomes more widely known, everyone needs to know the injustices taking place in the world. Thankyou for taking the time to emphasise your feelings and emotions over this .

156,valdemar-941-974183,Pete Postelwhaite's Death,10,3 January 2011,On the day Pete P died I think it is important to remember that when the film In the Name of the Father was first released it was banned in Guildford. The local Odeon outlet refused to show it. The film's story is based on an IRA bombing of a Guildford pub. The people arrested and sentenced for this offense were clearly innocent but the Surrey Police did not see it like that.Pete P was the consummate actor. A man who could say by the expression on his face all that had to be said about what was happening.The Surrey Police are seriously indicted in this film but as far as I know they were never held to account. Guildford was too well set in its conventional ways to assume that a Irishman could be trusted.,In the Name of the Father
157,elisabethsofie,Man's coerced confession to an IRA bombing he didn't do imprisons his father as well; a British lawyer helps fight for their freedom.,9,14 April 2011,"Jim Sheridan is an acclaimed film director and a good storyteller. Jim was born in Dublin, in 1949, and later moved to America in 1982. He directed the movie ""In The name of the father"" which was a hit all around the world.With an actor like Daniel Day-Lewis, how could this movie go wrong? The movie is based on a true-story that took place in Ireland. Daniel plays a character named Gerry Conlon, who is a small time thief from Belfast (England). Gerry is falsely implicated in the IRA bombing of a pub that kills several people while he is in London. The British police 'force' Gerry and the four of his friends to confessing their guilt about the bombing. Gerry's father decides to help his son, but ends up in prison as well. He ends up spending 15 years in prison with his father trying to prove his innocence with the help of a female British attorney. The genre is biography and drama. I really liked the movie because it had a lot of talented actors and actresses that had good chemistry. Even thought the movie was depressing, thanks to the acting from Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite, they managed to draw at least a few chuckles in some sequences. The editing was well done, and matched perfectly. I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie. It has a great cast, good story, good amount of effects (lighting/cutting/editing etc.) I'll give it a 9/10.",In the Name of the Father
158,vannmannen_nina91,A great movie that everyone should watch at least one time,8,14 April 2011,"'In the name of the father' is a movie based on a true story. The story is about a young lad and his father that end up in the hands of the IRA-police because they think Gerry Conlon put a bomb in an British pub. Gerry and his pal Danny travel to Gerry's to get a job and get away from the hometown. They find some new friends that are hippies. Their lifestyle gets a little different, but they still follow the law. His father Giuseppe traveled from their family's home in Ireland to England, to help his son. When they both are put in jail the family do all they can to get them out. Gerry aunt is also arrested and gets many years in prison. Gerry is young and handles the prison-life better than his father. Giuseppe gets pneumonia and Gerry helps him rubbing a strong lotion on his chest to open up his airways. After a while Giuseppe dies, and Gerry swears to clear his fathers name. A British lawyer, Gareth Peirce helps Gerry to get his case reopened so that they will get a new chance in court. When the case is reopened many years later, Gerry has read in a tape with his side of the story. This will help him a great deal in the second court round. The genre of the movie is typically drama. Policemen who are bad, people who gets punished for things they didn't do, and the ending of the movie. The fluidity in the film was good and comfortable to watch. The nice editing job made the movie a great deal better than it would have been with a poor editing job. The sound could be better, but all in all the movie was good even though the sound was a little bit shrill. I would give this movie a 5, in a scale from 1-6.",In the Name of the Father

In a time when many are rightfully or wrongfully held in Guantanamo for tangential relations to terrorist groups, media riling up the mobs against people like Richard Jewell without evidence, and laws which trample of civil rights being passed in the name of terrorism, this movie's message rings true today. The acting, especially that of Day-Lewis, and direction are spot on. If you haven't seen this movie, I strongly recommend it.

161,evelyn_illa,Some Reflections On My Country,10,31 July 2013,"(English is my second language, so please excuse my language problems:)Yes, I cried when other prisoners threw lighted papers from the window; yes, Daniel-Day Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite were great actors; but other than that, what impressed me most was the complete change of attitudes of the public between the two trials. At first, audience in the court were yelling ""hang these Irish bastards"", they were throwing all their hatred to the Guildford Four, even the judge said ""I wonder why you are not charged as treason"". They were biased, cheated by the prosecutes who fabricated lies to cater to the public, because the loss of 5 lives needed someone to be responsible for. But after 15 years, when the truth was presented, the public went to parade, they plead the court to free the four, they wanted to right the wrong. They were becoming rational, they felt for the innocent, so they acted.But this is not what happens here in China. The government is never transparent to the public, the media is censored so that cases like the Guildford 4 (especially if it is injustice) will never be known to the general public unless you are ""in the business"". Because the public is banning from first-hand information, people are unaware of government's wrongdoings; even if they are aware, there is almost nothing they can do (party monopoly, corruption all lead to this). So they kept silent, pretending nothing ever happened. I once read on a book, saying ""silence is the most terrifying weapon"". Today I have to admit this fact; but I want to say and plea to all my fellow citizens: pretending to be deaf doesn't mean that there is no voice in the society to be heard. They are merely sunk in the indifferent public. So please pay attention to politics, to events taking place in courts. Maybe someday we also will make cardboards with slogans on then and march in streets. Efforts from individuals could gather to really make change.",In the Name of the Father

Their amazing on screen synergy is a big part of this films appeal which tackles a tough subject about injustice and the state of Britain at the time. Day-Lewis captures his characters' (Gerry Conlon) evolution in an Oscar worthy way and proves himself to be a very diverse actor. Supporting actor Emma Thompson delivers a touching performance as the lawyer working towards getting the case appealed.Director Jim Sheridan does a good job and uses a mix of methods to enhance a scene's importance or emotional weight. The pacing is very good and all three acts of the film are excellent. Overall it's fantastic film that seems to be very faithful to it's source material.,In the Name of the Father
163,ahferris,Veritable Fallacies,9,19 June 2014,"John Forbes Nash Jr. (Russell Crowe), a brilliant young mathematician and recipient of the prestigious Carnegie Scholarship at Princeton, finds himself at a loss while searching for a truly original idea to be published. With the unwitting help of his roommate Charles, several classmates, and a stranger at the pub, he stumbles onto a new theory of governing dynamics that ultimately earns him a place in history. He soon goes to work for Wheeler Defense Labs where he becomes a code breaker for the U.S. Government as well as a professor. Through his work, John meets his wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and U.S. Department of Defense agent William Parcher (Ed Harris), who both prove to be very influential in many different ways. As he tries to find his way on a path to recognition, he finds himself struggling with a much stronger force than intelligence . . . schizophrenia.John Nash spent most of his life in a lonely state of superiority. His quest for a truly original idea and his overwhelming feeling of failure when he can't seem to find it show that he valued his intellect above all else. When he finds that he can no longer trust his own mind, the mind that served as his only friend for a great portion of his life, we as an audience become as confused and devastated as he was. Director Ron Howard brings the viewers into his world, into his state of confusion, to shed light onto the lesson he learned. Yes, John Nash was exceptionally intelligent, but he was also fragile in a very humbling way. Because of this, he came to hold humanity and love in a very dear little place in his once cold, blindly driven heart. I appreciate and almost envy that heart-breaking learning process. I feel myself falling, growing, smashing, and squishing my way through a distantly related struggle towards contentment. I can connect with his desire for greatness, his ultimate descent back down to earth, and the feeling of peace that followed. This film has shown me that we will never live up to our own expectations, but we can achieve a much more remarkable form of greatness by accepting our fallibility.",In the Name of the Father

A wonderful performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite, as father and son are faced with one of the English Systems major mistakes. The sense of pathos and frustration runs high in a film which explores the northern Irish Conflict during the 1970's and 1980's. I watched this film for the first time after the 7/7/05 and I hope it serves as a reminder to politicians and those involved in countering terrorism that we have a fair and just legal system and it shouldn't be usurped in order to gain convictions simply to pacify the grievances of the public.

As a young man I remember well the tabloid publicity and rantings against the defendants - one lone journalist and belief in themselves as innocents led to justice for these poor people. NEVER LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN, FREE THE INNOCENT! As for the film - superb performances, Pete Postlethwaite is brilliant, and this is Daniel Day-Lewis' best role ever. Just brilliant.

My son pointed this problem out to me when he saw the film at the age of 12; I myself, like the many people who have found the plot to be credible, had not picked up on it.

167,irwina,'In the Name of the Father': a moving masterpiece,10,12 October 2005,"'In the Name of the Father' is a compelling portrayal of the harrowing ordeal faced by Gerry Conlon, his family and friends, who were wrongfully imprisoned for the Guildford Pub bombing in the 1970s. The film is skilfully manipulated to show a myriad of contrasts and juxtapositions, such as when Gerry is being tortured and interrogated in his cell, the police in the hallway are unconcerned as they celebrate someone's birthday with a cake.The framing of shots and camera angles used emphasise the helplessness Gerry and the others experience. There is also a particularly moving scene in which prisoners show their respect when Gerry's father dies by dropping flaming material from their windows, like a waterfall of burning tears.The soundtrack uses music which is carefree or haunting in all the right places, perfectly mirroring the scenes and adding to the mood of the film. The themes of injustice and corruption are heightened through irony in the dialogue, and are representative of the problems faced by Irish Catholics in the 1970s and beyond.'In the Name of the Father' is a beautifully constructed film which is a credit to the actors, direction and production crew.I challenge you not to be moved by this film.",In the Name of the Father
168,nephyrulz,'In the Name of the Father'- a compelling story,9,21 October 2005,"'In the Name of the Father' is a true story based on the Guildford Four. In particular it follows the story of Gerry Conlon who was wrongly accused of the Guildford Pub bombing in the 1970's.There were some outstanding performances by Emma Thompson who played Gareth Peirce, Pete Postlethwaite who played Giuseppe Conlon but by far the best performance was by Daniel Day-Lewis who played Gerry Conlon. He made his character seem so real and believable making the audience sympathize with him. The last speech he made was very passionate and well spoken leaving the audience with a tear in their eye because they were so moved.The layout of the film was interesting by the way they showed the bombing right at the start of the film then going back to Gerry in Ireland and follow what he does up until the bombing and afterward. This captures the audience attention from the start making them interested and willing to find out what will happen next.The film shots and camera angles help to emphasize the feelings and emotions felt at certain parts of the film. For instance, there are many times when Giuseppe is shown behind Gerry to show how Giuseppe is always looking over Gerry's back. There is also a shot that shows the police officer looking down on Gerry in an intimidating way trying to get him to sign a confession.The soundtrack sets the mood in the scenes, it was happy when Gerry was happy, dramatic when it was a dramatic sound and sad when something bad happened. It really helped to set up the scenes. There was a lot of good music that kept the audience interested.There were many themes that were clearly shown in this film. These were injustice, corruption, family values and equal rights. The dialogue clearly showed these themes and helped to make the audience really think about them.'In the Name of the Father' is a moving film that really captures the audience's attention and keeps them in suspense the whole time.

169,amanda_koura14,"In the name of the father, in the name of the son",9,24 October 2005,"""In the name of the father"" directed by Jim Sheridan, not only takes you through a poignant journey of awareness in its political and social context, but also tells a story of an alienated father and son that only reach an understanding through their shared circumstance in a prison cell.After mass speculation, angry protests and the passing of the terrorism act on the wake of the Guildford bombing(October 5, 1974), Gerry Conlon(Daniel Day-Louis) and his friends Paul Hill(John Lynch), Paddy Armstrong(Mark Sheppard) and Carole Richardson(Beatie Edney), become the lead suspects following an inquiry by the British police into their whereabouts.None of the Guildford four fitted ""the bill"" in terms of being associated with the IRA because of their lifestyle. They were merely in the wrong place at the wrong time. Gerry Conlon was a petty thief from Derry, Northern Ireland and Patrick Armstrong and Carole Richardson lived in a squat and also had involvement with drugs and petty crime. There were many inconsistencies in the case against them, However with the enormous pressure on the police and the state by the public, they were tortured and threatened into signing confessions and later sentenced to life imprisonment on murder charges, along with Gerry's father Guiseppe Conlon(Pete Postelwaithe).Although it is emotional enough to be privy to the truth towards the innocence of these eight Northern Irish people, who are victims to perhaps one of the most profound miscarriages of Justice in the history of England or the world, we see the eventual bonding of a father and son who were once coldly distanced. After years in a Jail cell they reach a sought of understanding that allows them to communicate on a more intimate level.One of the most strong manifestations of this, is when Gerry is shown to be looking after Guiseppe instead of the reverse, before his death. When Guiseppe dies, the scene showing the fire tears dropping down from the prison windows is one of the most harrowing of the film. This Juxtaposed against the tears that are running down Gerry's face and the reflection of it in his eyes, is testament to the directing genius of Jim Sheridan to create a symbolic portrayal of his grief. In the name of the father visually enhances what the true story presents, through its imagery and dramatization.Another scene that is worth noting, is also in the opening. It is an adrenalin rush as we are confronted with the singular image of the pub exploding, which is then accompanied by the exhilarating dischorded sound of U2's Bono and Gavin Friday conveniently titled, ""In the name of the father"". The soundtrack though-out the movie is guaranteed to send shivers down your spine, as all scenes are imbued with nothing but the most appropriate music to accompany the deftly created ambiance. Whether it is the chilling, eerie sounds that scream horror in the confessions room, or the 70's Hippie rock n' roll in the opening scene at Derry in Northern Ireland at the start of the riot, the music is an excellent form of augmentation to the mood.Daniel Day-Louise and Pete Postelwaithe do an excellent job of carrying out their roles as divided father and son on bad terms. In all Gerry's delinquent, childish swagger, Daniel Day-Louise is able to reach beyond this to show his honest, emotional side rendering him a more sympathetic character. Similarly, Postelwaithe does an excellent job of conveying a paragon of what is honest and decent as well as a father who is extremely critical but caring of his son at the same time.""In the name of the father"" reaches beyond the politically electric content of the true story, to the human issues behind it. We see the experiences of Gerry and Guiseppe Conlon in the face of extreme adversity and injustice. It is another influential tribute to the human spirit and another piece of evidence that truth tends to be the first casualty in such situations like the one the Guildford four found themselves in. But farther than even this, we share the moving experience of seeing a father and son come together amidst the torrent that was enveloping them, finding peace, courage and motivation in each other.",In the Name of the Father
170,minch_d7,A true memorable story of injustice,9,22 October 2005,"Jim Sheridan made the movie ""In the Name of the Father"" based on the autobiography ""Proved innocent"" by Gerry Conlon. In the Name of the Father displayed the true story of the ""Guildford Four"" and retells there miraculous journey to freedom. The movie displays the process of innocent average Irishmen wrongfully accused for bombing a pub in Guildford.A bombing occurred on October 5th, 1974 in a Guildford pub in England. The head of the police force Robert Dixon (Corin Redgrave) arrested the accused bombers Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Paul Hill (John Lynch). Gerry's father, Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite) helps Gerry find a lawyer but then gets charged for participating in the bombings.Gerry and Paul were sentenced to life in prison because there was insufficient evidence for them to be hung. The only chance for them to be set free was through a lawyer named Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson) who attempts to set them free by gathering scraps of evidence.The movie showed the actual story of the ""Guildford Four"" in many views. Jim Sheridan displayed views from Robert Dixon under public pressure, injustice towards the ""Guildford Four"" and also Jim Sheridan showed the development of Gerry and Giuseppe's father and son relationship. The development was shown clearly because at first Gerry and Giuseppe had a weak relationship but they then discovered they could connect and formed a closer bond.Gerry Conlon and Giuseppe form a great duo as father and son and perform a very convincing relationship. Many movies lack the actors to play a true father and son relationship but Daniel and Pete play it with perfection. Another memorable performance was by Corin Redgrave who played a firm and sly policeman determined to put the case away.The camera angles and shots of the movie were remarkable in presenting the scenes. When there was a riot in the beginning of the film, the camera used was hand held so that made you feel you were there. The lighting and music was very significant in the film by choosing the right colour and sounds to help set the mood to express the scene. Certain scenes such as depressing or dim scenes were shown with a dark blue colour and sad touching orchestra hymns to set the mood.The film In the Name of the Father successfully portrays the true story of the ""Guildford Four"" from different perspectives. Jim Sheridan accurately displays the events that lead to the freedom of the ""Guildford Four"". During their journey to freedom, the development of the father and son relationship is shown and society's views on the events that occur. The movie is based around injustice and proves to be a memorable movie which will be remembered by all.",In the Name of the Father
171,chutters88,Movie Review,8,22 October 2005,"COURTNEY VANDERPLUYM IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER 'Well, I think they ought to take the word 'compassion' out of the English dictionary.' Jim Sheridan's In the Name of The Father is an emotional movie portraying the real life story of the Guildford Pub Bombings, and the people wrongly accused of doing it. You see an in-depth look into the corruption of the Authorities, the callousness of the IRA, the struggles of the innocent, the terrible events that bring a father and son from a cold relationship to a close one, and a lawyers ambition to uncover the truth.On October 5, 1974 the IRA bombed a Guildford Pub in England, resulting in the deaths of five innocent people. The police, headed by Robert Dixon, became under intense pressure to find the bombers and make the public feel safe.Meanwhile in another town in England, Two Irish boys, Gerry Conland and Paul Hill, were walking the streets, broke and looking for a place to stay. Gerry Conland, a mischievous, petty thief was sent over to England by his father to straighten his life out. Gerry was always getting in trouble with the IRA and his relationship with his father was cold and distant. Gerry, Paul and two other Irish People that were living in a squat with them, have their lives turned around when they are accused of committing the bombings.Paul Hill was taken in to custody, and tortured until he admitted to the crimes and named others involved. Hill, being innocent, signs the confession and naming people who aren't in the IRA as his accomplices, assuming it would all be sorted out in court. Gerry, along with the others, are all threatened and hurt until they sign a confession.Gerry's father, Guiseppe arrives in England to sort out the mess his son is in, but soon becomes arrested along with a few relatives and are accused of also being involved in the Bombings.The court trial comes but the news is not so good, they are all found guilty, and sentenced to life changing jail time. Dixon, along with his colleagues, find there alibi's and know they are innocent, but corruption takes over, they hide the truth so they have people to pin the blame on, even if they are the wrong people.Gerry, Giuseppe and all the other accused terrorists are sent of to jail, with four of them receiving life terms. Gerry and Giuseppe are sent into a jail together, soon to learn they are complete strangers, and don't know each other at all. Years pass, and jail began to take it's toll on the Conlands. Gerry has lost all hope in being saved, whilst his ill father fights for their innocence.In their struggle to make it in jail, Gerry and Giuseppe soon become closer than ever, they get rid of their demons and are able to be close to each other. During this time, Giuseppe hires Gareth Pierce, a lawyer, to uncover the truth. The lawyer is passionate about the case and puts her heart and soul into helping them and putting a stop to the corruption. The real Guildford bomber is found and sent to jail, but the authorities turn a blind eye to it, leaving the blame on the Conlands.Many years pass, Guiseppe soon passes away, leaving Gerry to fight for their innocence. In a twist of fate, Gareth uncovers the confession of a man who was Gerry's alibi. She takes the evidence to court, and with an emotional speech, which will surely be remembered, she Gets the Guildford four out of jail.The movie ends on Gerry outside the court claiming his innocence and telling the crowd his will fight until his father is also found innocent.The movie uses camera angles and lighting, which makes you realize who the innocent or that guilty are. Lighting is used for a mood setting, e.g. Blue lighting leading up to the moments before Guiseppe's Death. The music is used to set the mood, and build up to big moments in the movie e.g. Loud dramatic music is used during the bombings.This emotionally charged movie, really made you question the corruption that takes place today, and the struggles and stories of the innocent people that become mixed up in it.",In the Name of the Father

A lawyer with great hope for Giuseppe. She dint give up on the case and kept fighting. She believed they were innocent and stood her grounds. Sometimes she had to play dirty in order to find justice and to show innocents. This showed that throughout this case there may have been no justice. In the name of the father has shown facts surrounding the Guildford four but mainly shows upon the relationship between a father and son. A relationship that through time grew stronger. Once Giuseppe found to be sick he knew his time was to be short, within this time Gerry and his self started to respect and trust each other more, Gerry found himself looking after his father making sure he stayed well. Once Giuseppe passed Gerry found he fought for what was right and teamed up with Gareth Pierce to fight for justice.All prevailed when folders were found with markings stating not to show the defendant.

173,emmah_28,Injustice and corruption,6,23 October 2005,"'In the Name of the Father' is a persuasive account of injustice based on a true story following the wrongful imprisonment of Gerry Conlon and others connected to him for a bombing of a pub in London set in the 1970s. Despite their innocence the British police are intent on using them as scapegoats against an ongoing battle with the IRA and use horrific methods such as torture to force them into falsely signing confessions. The story follows their attempts to clear their names and achieve justice in a world of corruption.Injustice is brought up relentlessly throughout the film being one of the main themes among other themes such as corruption and family values.The actors in this film, such as Daniel Day-Lewis (Gerry) and Pete Postlewaite (Giuseppe) represent their, at times complex, characters competently, and are matched by the satisfactory producing and directing of the film.The film techniques are skilfully used in all aspects of the film. The film moves from past to present continuously as Gerry tells his story to Gareth Peirce, to emphasize their innocence and to set the storyline. Camera angles are cleverly used to bring sympathy towards Gerry and the others with regard to the helplessness they go through.The music continuously sets the scene and delivers the right atmosphere and mood to evoke the emotions of the viewers, providing a deeper understanding of the situation and context.Overall, a well-produced film with an interesting and emotional storyline.",In the Name of the Father
174,mic0004,"""In the Name of the Father"" review",9,24 October 2005,"It's refreshing to view a based on factual events, without the fabricated love story used by directors to enhance the entertainment value. Instead, In The Name of the Father, the audience is exposed to a beautifully crafted film portraying the injustice of the Guildford Four trial, with the central focus regarding the emotional conflict between father and son.""In the Name of the Father"" remains faithful to the story of Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis), a man wrongfully accused of the Guildford pub bombing in London, 1974. His unfortunate events affect his whole family and friends, as they are used as scapegoats by the police, blamed for a crime they didn't commit. The film continues to highlight the injustice of the Guildford case, resulting in life imprisonment. Even so, with the faith derived from his father, Conlon's spirit remains alive as he faces the hardships of prison, and the ongoing hope as they both attempt to re-open the case after 15 years with the aid of the lawyer, Gareth Pierce (Emma Thompson).It isn't surprising that the movie was nominated for 7 academy awards, especially with an exceptional cast to embody one of the most 'emotionally charged cases in British history'. And one wonders how much emotions influenced the convicted decision made by the jury, when we witness the public present in the courtroom yelling obscenities to the accused! Daniel Day Lewis(Gerry Conlon), together with Pete Postelwaithe (Giuseppe, Gerry's father) manage to capture the emotion of the case, as well as their strained relationship. When Gerry attacks Giuseppe in the prison cell, the camera remains focused on both men's faces, capturing the pain and frustrations on Lewis' face, and contrasting the look of disbelief on Giuseppe's.The music in the movie is to be commended, with a different yet accurate tune used to reflect the sequences displayed on film. From the loud, thunderous rock tune at the beginning, to the intense rhythmic beating before the anticipated walk to the courtroom, as well as the soulful, heart wrenching ballad played as the prisoner's throw out paper flames in a desperate cry for help, it is undeniable that the music is the essence of a film with such emotional depth.In ""The Name of the Father"", the audience become touched by the story of an uncommunicative father and son, whose relationship prospers on new found trust and respect, all the while dealing with the political issues regarding their wrongful imprisonment. If not watched for the acting or the camera's remarkable ability to captivate, even the storyline is enough to keep a person entranced!",In the Name of the Father
175,melbykins11,This is an amazing movie,10,28 December 2005,"This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. I felt so sorry for the people who were imprisoned: they hadn't done anything wrong but were in the wrong place at the wrong time. The acting is superb too; Daniel Day-Lewis is amazing. You feel so much for the characters in this movie that it's almost impossible to forget them. I can't even imagine what they went through being wrongfully imprisoned, and I don't think anyone can. The soundtrack is phenomenal for this movie: I purchased it and it still haunts me when I listen to it. It's a shame that many people don't know about this movie. I would seriously suggest renting this movie; you won't regret it.",In the Name of the Father
