0,Leofwine_draca,"Not the worst, not the best",5,8 March 2020,"THE BEGUILED is another ill-advised remake of an old-time movie, this time one of Clint Eastwood's more unusual pictures. I groaned inwardly when I saw that Sofia Coppola was directing - the memory of watching LOST IN TRANSLATION still haunts me - but the surprise is that this isn't bad at all. It's certainly well shot and acted, with Colin Farrell working hard in a difficult role and some of the female cast members also proving their worth in various ways, with Kristen Dunst the most interesting and Nicole Kidman the least. This is a slow-burning movie that picks up steam as it moves along, leading to an extended climax that provides plenty of effective drama. Like other Coppola movies I've seen parts of, however, it does suffer from the style-over-substance syndrome and ultimately feels hollow at times.",The Beguiled
1,SnoopyStyle,nice haunted vibe,6,24 February 2018,"It's 1864 Virginia, 3 years into the Civil War. Amy finds wounded Yankee soldier Corporal John McBurney (Colin Farrell) in the woods and brings him back to Miss Martha Farnsworth (Nicole Kidman)'s Seminary for young girls. All the slaves have run away. Edwina Morrow (Kirsten Dunst) is the last remaining teacher and Alicia (Elle Fanning) is one of the older students. Martha decides to let the Yankee rest rather than turning him over to the Confederates. The situation heats up as the female occupants compete for the prisoners' attention.Sofia Coppola delivers a quiet, sparse tale of female competitive power. McBurney is no saint either. It's an empty fleeting world especially with the slaves abandoning the mansion. There is something eerie about this creation. I do want for more tension or more horror like Misery. It's hard to sympathize with any of the characters. Maybe she should concentrate on Edwina as the only protagonist. This has a nice haunted vibe but I don't feel for anybody.",The Beguiled
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Popcorn cinema - nothing more, nothing less",6,27 July 2017,"""The Beguiled"" is an American 90-minute movie from this year that was written and directed by Sofia Coppola and it is another strong addition to her career and is further helping her get out of her father's big footsteps. But the writing part is only partially true because the movie is based on a novel by Thomas Cullinan. So was the movie back in the early 1970s with Clint Eastwood playing the male protagonist. I have neither read the book nor seen the old version, so my approach here is fresh as a spring chicken. I would say I enjoyed the watch here overall. The cast gives good performances and even Kidman and Dunst that I am usually not a fan of were pretty decent I would say. Farrell was good as expected and his role here probably increases his heart throb status. My favorite from the cast, Elle Fanning, proves again she is among the best from her age group. And she is gorgeous too, a gorgeous beast her role is this time. I must admit I am not familiar with the other (all very young) actresses. We will see how their careers go in the next decades.The first half of the film (probably slightly more even) is pretty harmless, romance may be the biggest genre and comedy may be more frequent than drama almost as the jealousy is there, but feels equally harmless and entertaining to watch. Then, after the amputation, it gets a lot more serious, very dramatic and pretty thrilling at times. Edge-of-seat material too and you wonder what happens next. A bit of a shame the trailer includes major spoilers. Nonetheless, as a whole, it was a good watch. I am not the biggest fan of period pieces really, but this one I liked. The air in the theater was basically full with estrogen from the film's characters. You could maybe say that Coppola makes films that are more for females than males (also her previous collaboration with Dunst) and you probably would not be wrong at all. But men can enjoy it too, if they can stomach scenes like the amputation being a direct consequence of the cheating. It's not a feminist or misogynist film by any means though. It's all good. I have a feeling that if anybody from the cast will score awards attention, then it will be Kidman, but maybe I am wrong. I also have a feeling that the movie already peaked in terms of awards recognition and will not repeat its success from Cannes with the big American awards bodies. We shall see. This of course is not anywhere near the level of Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"", one of my favorite films of all time, maybe number one, but ""The Beguiled"" is an interesting little film that is not too long for its own good and succeeds in its own right. I recommend checking it out.",The Beguiled
3,nogodnomasters,Inferior remake,5,6 December 2017,"Colin Farrell plays the ""blue belly"" soldier who is injured and nursed back to health by a group of Confederate women. For some reason he schmoozes all the females into thinking they are his favorite...which backfires.This is a watered down remake of the 1971 classic, a film I considered superior all around. Perhaps the reason I failed to enjoy this feature was my exposure to the original with Clint Eastwood and Pamelyn Ferdin. Watch it instead, Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity",The Beguiled
4,Sleepin_Dragon,A victory for sleep inducement.,5,21 July 2019,"Despite being well acted and beautifully made, this film is one of the most boring things I've ever say through. It took me three sittings to get through it, the pacing is atrocious, I know they were aiming for subtle, but they misjudged it, and as a viewer you're left fighting to stay awake.The original is superior in almost every aspect, and is definitely more watchable. The only saving grace so far as I can see is the performance of Colin Farrell.Lovely to look at, but lacks any sort of emotional feeling. 5/10",The Beguiled
5,classicsoncall,"""We can show him some real Southern hospitality.""",6,15 February 2018,"If the decision were to be considered again, I wonder if the film makers would have remade this sequel to the 1971 original starring Clint Eastwood. That version included elements of Gothic horror that didn't translate in this film, making it seem almost bland by comparison. Certainly the director didn't take the story in any kind of new direction. It might not be a scene for scene copy or have line for line dialog, but the picture is basically the same as the one from forty six years ago without the hard edge. My feelings might be tempered by the fact that I'm a Clint Eastwood fan but that doesn't explain all of it. There just seemed to be something missing here that didn't provide the same kind of tension the earlier film did.One plus perhaps though, was the omission of Miss Martha's ambiguous flashback sequence from the first picture. In it, it's hinted that she had an incestuous relationship with her own brother that proved troublesome and virtually unrelated to the way events in the story played out. What bothered me in this film specifically was the scene in which Corporal McBurney (Colin Farrell) had his way with Edwina (Kirsten Dunst). Edwina came to his room willingly, yet the potential relationship between the two was virtually turned into a rape scene. That didn't make a lot of sense to me.But boy oh boy, once again we had Amy's turtle setting up one of the catalysts for McBurney's eventual downfall. That goes back to what I said earlier about the film's script following along so closely with the Eastwood picture. I thought they might have exchanged the turtle for something a little more warm and fuzzy, like a rabbit or a puppy. Right then and there, I knew McBurney set himself up for a one-way ticket out the gates of the Farnsworth Seminary for Young Ladies. You just don't mess with a little girl's pet turtle.",The Beguiled
6,jboothmillard,The Beguiled,4,1 June 2020,"The original Don Siegel/Clint Eastwood is an interesting and at times dark period movie, I was surprised when I saw a trailer for a remake movie, but at the same time I was intrigued, directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation, Marie Antoinette, A Very Murray Christmas). Basically, set in Louisiana during the American Civil War, twelve-year-old Amelia ""Amy"" (Oona Laurence) is picking mushrooms in the woods. There, she discovers a wounded soldier, Union Corporal John McBurney (Colin Farrell), on the verge of death. She rescues him, bringing him to her all-girl boarding school, the Miss Martha Farnsworth Seminary for Young Ladies. There, his broken leg slowly heals, he is nursed back to health with the help of school headmistress, Martha Farnsworth (Nicole Kidman). Miss Farnsworth decides that they will let his leg heal before they decide what they will do with him. The rest of the girls at the school fear the wounded soldier locked up with them at first. But Edwina Morrow (Kirsten Dunst), the schoolteacher, who has no experience with men, takes an immediate liking to John. Soon the other girls tend to him, fascinated by a full-grown man in proximity, and he charms them all one by one. When Confederate soldiers arrive at the school, Miss Farnsworth does not tell them that a Union soldier is on the premises. The young women are all sexually repressed, and an atmosphere of jealousy and deceit forms, with a few of the girls wanting to get closer to John. Martha also becomes infatuated with John, and later she makes sexual advances toward him, which he resists. One night, John tells Edwina to await him in her room, but he does not appear. Edwina discovers John having sex with teenage pupil Alicia (Elle Fanning) in her bedroom. In a jealous rage, she beats him with a candlestick, causing him to fall down the staircase and break his already injured leg. Martha insists that the only way to save his life is to amputate the leg. John wakes the next day and realises that his leg has been removed, he is devastated and furious, convinced that Martha did it as revenge for him rejecting her sexual advances. John and Edwina's romantic relationship deepens, while his relationships with the other women deteriorate. After threatening Alicia, he is locked in a room, before breaking out and grabbing a gun. He is convinced he is being held prisoner and threatens the women before storming off. Edwina follows him to his room, and they have sex. Martha is convinced they are not safe while John is in the house, so, without Edwina's knowledge, they form a plan to kill him, with poisoned mushrooms. At dinner, John apologises for his actions, and Edwina reveals that she and John plan to leave together and ger married. John has been eating the mushrooms, an dis not suspicious when the others mention to Edwina, unaware of the situation, that she does not like mushrooms. Seconds after eating, John coughs and eventually falls to the floor dead, Edwina is devastated. It ends with the women dragging McBurney's body in a shroud outside so that he will be found by the next Confederate soldiers who pass by. Also starring Angourie Rice as Jane, Addison Riecke as Marie, and Emma Howard as Emily. Farrell, using his own Irish accent, gives a reasonable performance as the soldier craved for by the young women, Kidman is pretty good as the headmistress, and Fanning and Dunst do well also. This is a fairly dark and gritty story, but it cannot quite match up to the original, it is stylish and melodramatic enough, and the period detail is good, but it just doesn't feel as moody, it feels a bit bland, an alright Western drama. Okay!",The Beguiled
7,ma-cortes,Colorful remake in which an Union soldier arrives in a seminary for young ladies and who soon reveals his opportunist nature,6,14 September 2020,"Outlandish and well made story set in Civil War South about a wounded soldier who arrives in a girls' school .

The flick soon develops into a kind of full blood drama , smouldering with intrigue , suspense , troubled sexuality , tragic events and suppressed passions ; and all of them lead to an unpredictable and startling conclusion .

As fine acting from Colin Farrell as the Yankee corporal who after being wounded during the civil war takes refuges in an isolated Southern seminary . Excellent interpretation from Nicole Kidman as zealous ruler , she is a fading Southern woman , brooding over the past , and Kirsten Dunst and Elle Fanning as two naive South belle girls who fall for the seducer soldier . It results to be an inferior remake to ¨Beguiled¨ (1971) that maybe the stranger , yet spellbinding combination of two genius -Clint Eastwood/Donald Siegel- ever made and Siegel's favorite of all his movies ; however , being commercially a failure because Universal Studios released it with advertisements that suggested it was an action movie.It packs atmospheric and attractive musical score by Phoenix .

8,Quinoa1984,"""You'll find them... easily amused""",9,29 June 2017,"I was a little taken aback by how much I was enthralled and near the end overwhelmed by The Beguiled. It may be due to some (misplaced?) expectations on my end when it comes to the director; I admire Sofia Coppola's films on the whole - Lost in Translation to be sure, but also parts of Marie Antoinette and Somewhere are striking and affecting in that 'is-it-shallow or is it deep' sort of ambiguous, poetic way she has with her cinematography and storytelling - but until now haven't felt like I connected that strongly with the characters or in the world that's created. Even with Murray and Johansson in LiT there was something that kept one at a distance (again, this is just me, I'm sure many others feel different), despite the curious subjects at play. In The Beguiled, Coppola has a plot to work with - it's one that should be familiar if you've seen the 1971 film, which I can't help but get to - and it's a strong one. But she makes it her own and has a cast that KILLS across the board (some more literally than others! I'll be here all night, folks).I have a feeling when Coppola got this material, either if it was seeing the Clint Eastwood/Don Siegel film first or reading the book, she read into it something differently than Siegel did, and I'm glad she did. This isn't a tawdry B-movie melodrama, which was what that movie certainly presented itself as, and in some ways was all the better for it (has one seen Eastwood be that downright *sleazy* before or since?) This is Coppola trying on something closer to a piece of Gothic literature; if Marie Antoinette was her fluffy costume-period biopic, this is her trying to tackle one of the Brontes, only through cinematic grammar. She rarely uses music in the film, certainly not much at all in the first half, and when it comes up it's eerie and brooding, a low synth that sounds like someone is somewhere about to do something sinister. Or, in this case, giving what may be just desserts for some.You know the story? A Union officer is wounded and discovered by a young girl who is part of an all-girl's school in the South during the later part of the Civil War; she's cared for by the Head-School-Marm and he becomes a focal point of attention for the girls, whether they're pre-pubescent, adolescent, or way past that. He is polite and gentlemanly when he wakes up all stitched up, and tries to make himself useful - will be stay, or will he have to go? Meanwhile as this question hangs over scenes, the soldier John tries to ingratiate himself in another way, with smouldering and sexy looks and glances (hey, it's Colin Farrell looking like he took some of that medicine Paul Rudd's had to make himself look the same as he did 15 years ago, after all). But how will this all fall apart, we know we have to ask ourselves? If one's seen the trailer without having seen the original it may seem pretty clear - that was one of those trailers that gave away too much, I think, which is not fair for the majority of audiences that likely haven't seen one of the few Eastwood ""sleepers"" of the 70's so to speak - but there's still much more in the atmosphere that Coppola creates with her production team that is astounding. There's a dark tone to the cinematography so at times it seems like it's natural light only, but I'm not sure that's it; it feels diffuse, like we're looking at a painting, only it isn't the sort of period-painting creation of like a Kubrick Barry Lyndon. No, this is a little like Coppola taking her crack at Gothic horror where you can feel the sweat and stink of a plantation where slaves once worked. It feels raw and lived in, and the dresses the girls wear even have a bigger-than-life quality while still feeling organic to the story and place.By the way, there is one difference worth noting between the versions: Coppola doesn't have a slave character in the story (the little girl that saves Farrell says away in one line, ""the slaves left,"" which could mean any number of things considering the time, but it is post Emancipation as well), but this doesn't feel like she is trying to change things for the time. If anything the slave woman was one of the flaws for me in the original film, with a good actress saddled with a not totally believable portrayal of a slave woman. One might say Coppola chickened out or didn't go into what could've been more interesting/uncomfortable terrain. But I think she must've known a) there's already enough as far as sexual politics and WOMEN vs MAN going on to mine, and b) the story being more streamlined, this being shorter than the original, is a wise decision. There's not a wasted moment in this picture, and when there's a moment to see characters working or a meditative pause, it feels earned and part of the storytelling.Lastly, the acting: it's all wonderful, but Dunst is the one that I hope people remember the most here. Farrell and Kidman are the leads, but she's the one who has the most inner conflict, the person in this tale who has so much responsibility with these girls while at the same time wanting to choose her own path - maybe with John or maybe not. How can she? She's Coppola's one returning star now, and it's clear how her work is getting better, both in the script and how she gets to play it here as someone who has quiet desperation all over her. If one feels for anyone, whether it's in any mixed ways or not, it's for her. 9.5/10",The Beguiled
9,preppy-3,Well-done but slow and obvious,6,18 July 2017,"This takes place during the Civil War in Virginia. A Union solder named Corporal McBurney (Colin Farrell) is wounded and collapses near a remote girls seminary. It's run by Miss Martha (Nicole Kidman), has one teacher (Kisten Dunst) and five young girls. They take him in, nurse him back to health and plan to turn him over as son as he's well. However he wants to stay and starts romancing all the girls--especially Dunst. Then things take a tragic turn.NOT a remake of the 1971 Clint Eastwood film even though the plot and characters are much the same. The Eastwood film was a Gothic horror movie. This is a serious drama. It's beautifully directed by Sofia Coppola and has great acting by the entire cast. Also it's historically accurate. It's also slow-moving and frankly quite boring. It was pretty obvious to me where this was all going so there were no surprises. It does pick up considerably during the last half hour...but that's too little too late. Still this was highly praised and Coppola won Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival for this. So it looks great but is too slow for me.",The Beguiled

A mother (Nicole Kidman) and her daughters, sitting out the US Civil War in their plantation home, encounter an injured Yankee soldier (Colin Farrell). They take him in and nurse him back to health thereupon a whole load of eminently predictable challenges arise for these folks as the man attempts to play one off against the other before they eventually round on him. The dialogue and pace of the film are just dreary, no other word for it, and on the occasions when it could have become more engaging, particularly when there ought to be some chemistry (sexual or otherwise) - or even interesting - it all just fizzles out. The ending, though slightly quirky, is also well telegraphed from early on and all in all, I found this flat, ponderous, and really lacking in the psychological menace of Clint Eastwood's far more charismatic 1971 iteration.",The Beguiled

The original movie, released in 1971, was directed by Don Siegel and starred Clint Eastwood as the Union solider. While not brilliant, it was reasonably engaging and had a clever, powerful twist at the end.This, the 2017 version, is not overly engaging, feeling quite dry, a purely linear telling of events. The plot isn't exactly the same as the 1971 movie, effectively adding another act beyond the conclusion of Sigel's movie.

12,oscaralbert,"""No mercy; no surrender!"" is the clear message writer\director Sofia Coppola . . .",10,13 July 2017,". . . blares out to discerning Americans of Today with her remake of the 1971 Clint Eastwood feature. (SPOILER ALERT!!! All of the following information was obviously available to Ms. Coppola--who is still alive and kicking today, as am I; however, SOME of the original whistle-blowers providing these sordid details to her and I have since been assassinated with Ricin and Thorium by the Black Ops Anti-Leaker Hit-Men of Red Commie KGB Chief Vlad ""The Mad Russian"" Putin and his White House Puppet, Don Juan Rump. So if you pass any of this along to a friend or relative, try to be as subtle as the two of us, so that you, they, and THEIR contacts do not face a similar fate of liquidation!) Most every tweak made to the original 1971 script customizes THE BEGUILED remake to America's current predicament. For instance, in the Eastwood role, Colin's first words are ""I'm Corporal John Patrick McBurney of the New York 666th."" This entwines the Evil Beguiler with Puppet Rump in a New York Minute, of course, with the ""666"" cementing the Demonic Character as an amalgamation of Today's Two-Headed Gog and Magog, Putin\Rump. Even during the Fall 2016 Election campaign, ALL of Putin\Rump's supporters became familiar with the facts that 1)Rump's been impotent since the 1900s, 2)he's not getting enough satisfaction from merely poking his diminutive digits into often under-aged private orifices, 3)he's in the habit of owning ""beauty pageants"" so that he can barge in unannounced upon roomfuls of terrified nude teenage girls, and 4)that he was rewarded for decades of being chief money launderer through the Rump\Kushner Crime Syndicate for the World History's Biggest Theft Ever (during which Putin and a handful of his Oligarch henchmen stole HALF the net worth of Russia, ONE TRILLION BUCKS!) by being given his way in 2013 with the Cream of the World's P. Crop at a Moscow ""pageant"" (he was in the throes of working on a 17-year-old Miss Slovenia with a screwdriver when he agreed to kill off 22 million Americans by virtually ending Medicaid so he could disguise a $1 TRILLION kickback to his Red Commie KGB handlers as a ""tax break for America's Rich""). This version of THE BEGUILED hints at all of this by 1)showing John side-stepping the question of whether he's a Christian (he merely CLAIMS to have been Baptized, maybe), 2)wounded in the leg as well as Totally Unaroused when touched around his groin by an adult woman (obviously referencing D.J.'s impotence), 3)seducing all seven innocent, angelic-like dressed-in-white females as he exercises his demonic wiles through a series of contradictory, pathological lies, 4)picturing John as constantly wielding phallic symbols (including razors, axes, canes, guns, and crutches) to substitute for his defective manhood, and 5)implying the use of some sort of Phallus Helper as he rapes Edwina on the floor during the movie's climactic scene. Writer\director Coppola enlightens us that the sort of Demons America is now facing must be eliminated with Extreme Prejudice. As they say, ""Out of the Mouth of Babes""--and it is young Maria who suggests that Putin\Rump stand-in John MUST be poisoned with mushrooms. Merely letting him defect to Mother Russia on his next visit to the Kremlin will NOT bring Our USA Homeland any meaningful peace of mind. Just as Nicole Kidman's school has never faced a Crisis like John before, America has never previously been BEGUILED by one of Satan's Arch Fiends, let alone two. Reading between the lines of Ms. Coppola's script, and broadening her story's morale to America as a whole, it seems inescapable that ALL of the appointees of the so-called Putin\Rump Administration MUST be thoroughly purged through the Capital Punishment prescribed by the Constitution, along with the 224 Generals and Admirals Rump revealed were under Putin's control during the campaign. All of the ill-gotten misused assets, gold, bank accounts, weapons, and real estate of the Rich People's Party Rump Enablers must be seized under Public Forfeiture Laws, and then be used to Pay Off Our National Debt. There will be enough of this Stolen, Hoarded Wealth left over to provide the U.S. Silent Majority of True Blue Loyal Patriotic Progressive Normal Average Union Label Americans with a five or ten year moratorium on any and all taxes (that is, a Total Tax Break from all Government levies and fees). As assets are confiscated from job-killing corrupt corporations such as Walmart and Koch Industries, not to mention Exxon, Merrill Lynch, Big Banking and the rest of the Bigs, the slate MUST be wiped clean by canceling out all existing, mostly fraudulent mortgages, student loans, and credit card debt.

Unnecessary remake to Don Siegel/Clint Eastwood's Southern Gothic classic about a Civil War era tale of unbridled passion and revenge. To wit - injured Northern soldier Farrell finds solace in a girls' school led by a repressed woman (Kidman very far too low-key) and her unworldly charges chomping at the bit to be with their new guest. While filmmaker Sofia Coppola -who also adapted the Thoma Cullinan's novel - pulls out all the stops with handsome cinematography by Philippe Le Sourd and impeccable production design by Anne Ross the film is basically a beat-by-beat carbon copy of the original 1971 film adding nothing truly new to the story with decidedly mixed results (outside of the principal well-known leads the supporting cast is wan and interchangeable).",The Beguiled
14,evanston_dad,Sofia Coppola Removes Everything That Made the Original So Good,4,4 December 2017,"In 1971, Don Siegel gave us a wicked little film called ""The Beguiled."" It was a bit of atmospheric Southern Gothic entertainment, lurid and pulpy, and it got progressively creepier and weirder as it went along.That film was based on a novel, and whether Sofia Coppola intended for this remake to be a new version of the novel or the original film I don't know. What I do know is that she has drained from the film all of the atmosphere and bombast that made the original so good and has given us a bloodless and worse, irrelevant, movie that just sits on the screen doing nothing.Part (o.k. a HUGE part) of what made the first film so good was Geraldine Page in the role of the mistress of an all-girls school waiting out the Civil War in a humid swamp. Page was always a mannered actress, which could be distracting sometimes if she wasn't matched with the right role, but which worked hugely to her advantage in a movie like this that depends on a gradually building sense of insanity to work. Nicole Kidman takes on this role in Coppola's version, and while she may have been up to the task of meeting Page, she isn't asked to. Neither are any of the actresses who play the students given the chance to create the personalities their counterparts did, and especially missing is the sense of sexual repression that was so palpable in the 1971 version and without which the motivations and actions of the characters don't make a lot of sense.In the central male role we have Colin Farrell, a good actor but as much a victim of Coppola's vision as anyone else. Clint Eastwood played this role as a sexy, rugged, macho man whose mere presence upended the strict control Page's dominating headmistress had imposed on her school. He fancies himself in total control and enjoys the cat and mouse game he starts. But the mice become spiders, and the cat becomes a fly, and he (and we) realize that Page has been in control all along. When she chops off his leg, it's as much her way of punishing him for stepping out of bounds as it is to save it from infection. The new version flirts with that suggestion, but not enough. Farrell acts too crazy and dangerous, giving the females too much justification for treating him the way they do, which takes all of the creepiness out of the story.It's a shame, because in our current cultural climate, the showdown in this movie that begins with a false accusation of inappropriate sexual misconduct could be crazy relevant, and even with Coppola's tepid treatment of the material I was struck by that story line. But mostly I was left wondering why Coppola wanted to remake this in the first place if she was going to take out all the juicy parts and leave behind something so inert.Grade: C-",The Beguiled
15,AlsExGal,Stylish if lethargic remake of the 1971 film of the same name,6,15 November 2020,"In Civil War Virginia, wounded Union soldier McBurney (Colin Farrell) seeks shelter in the plantation house of Miss Martha (Nicole Kidman) who runs a school for young women. The war has reduced the student body to a handful of young girls and teenagers, and only one remaining teacher, Edwina (Kirsten Dunst). Vowing to nurse the injured man back to health before turning him in to the Confederate authorities, Miss Martha and the other girls all become enamored of the handsome soldier, with dire consequences.Director Sofia Coppola seems to be striving for a Barry Lyndon-esque natural light look, with no artificial lighting used at all, resulting in lots of gloomy and shadows during the evening scenes. The sound design also goes for an antiquated natural quiet, with the sounds of crickets and wind moving through the trees dominating, adding to a sleepy, dreamy atmosphere. The performers are all fine, and I even thought Farrell fit the manipulative soldier role better than Clint Eastwood did in the previous film. The three central women characters are noticeably different, though, and I felt they were each less compelling than those in the earlier movie (Kidman = Geraldine Page, Kirstin Dunst = Elizabeth Hartman, and Elle Fanning = Jo Ann Harris).

17,gradyharp,'It's seems the enemy... it's not what we believe',8,22 October 2017,"'It seems the enemy... it's not what we believe' Director Sofia Coppola continues to impress as she recreates a well-known novel by Thomas Cullinan as adapted for the screen by Albert Maltz, Irene Kamp (aka Grimes Grice) and Coppola herself. Yes, the film was also made in 1971 with Clint Eastwood and Geraldine Page, but this version is gentler and more subtle – not only because of Coppola's vision but also because of the impeccable cast she has selected. Very succinctly, the outline of the tale follows - While imprisoned in a Confederate girls' boarding school, an injured Union soldier cons his way into each of the lonely women's hearts, causing them to turn on each other, and eventually, on him.But with more atmosphere included the story is an impressive historical setting as realized by designer Anne Ross and captured on atmospheric (if a bit too dark) cinematography by Philippe Le Sourd. And a more insightful synopsis describes this psychological drama about love and betrayal during the Civil War. As the costly American Civil War still rages on, Jane (Angourie Rice) a 12-year-old student of the forgotten Miss Martha Farnsworth's Seminary for Young Ladies in warm and humid Louisiana stumbles upon a gravely wounded Union soldier, John McBurney (Colin Farrell). Taken in to recover from his injuries, the Corporal is imprisoned in a small room inside the mansion, however, before long, the seductive and unwanted guest will manage to take advantage of the female inhabitants' wartime-subdued desires. At first McBurney is met with careful and caring attention by Miss Martha (Nicole Kidman), Edwina (Kirsten Dunst), Alicia (Elle Fanning), Amy (Oona Lawrence), Marie (Addison Riecke) and Emil (Emma Howard). But McBurney charms them as they nurse him back to health, and his lustful manipulations cause them to spiral into jealous and vengeful rages against him. Feeling trapped, John realizes that his benefactress cannot be trusted with his love or with his life!The musical scoring by Laura Karpman and Phoenix (with nods to Monteverdi's 'Magnificat') greatly enhances the atmosphere. The story takes unexpected turns and ends rather surprisingly, but it all works well. Recommended",The Beguiled
18,mm-39,so so!,6,14 July 2017,"The Beguiled is a so so movie. What worked for the Beguiled is strong acting and casting. Not one bad performance and Kidman along with Farrel shine in their roles. Accurate portrayals of the fear and times of the civil war. The story keeps the viewer guessing of what will happen next. What did not work: The Beguiled was too short and left many open ended questions. Was Farrel's character's motive to woo the women in an attempt to stay out of the war? Did Farrel represent the invading Yankee? Was the Beguiled about sexual frustration and isolation which unbalanced the girls school with the arrival of the wounded soldier? The ending did it have to happen? Was the accident and ending representing the real power of the women's characters? Farrel thought he was playing the women, but in reality it was the women playing him maybe? The ending was lacking. ""That's it! Is what I thought.""",The Beguiled

This was the only reason I watched it, and now I lost my time. It's a period drama, and not even a good one. Sofia Coppola, daughter of Francis Ford Coppola, has clearly not the same talent as her dad. The story is very weak and most of the time boring, well for almost the entire movie. The only good thing about this movie is the cast. They are all good actors but that doesn't make the movie good. I guess Sofia Coppola tried to create some sexual tension between Colin Farrell and all the women and girls but even in that she failed.

Dreary & inconsistently paced, 'The Beguiled' genuinely wastes its potential. Coppola is not in form this time. We just wait for something unexpected to happen, but once the culmination happens, you're left unsatisfied. Coppola's Direction merits praise. She has handled a couple of sequences well. Cinematography is excellent. Editing is lazily done. Art & Costume Design deserve a special mention.Performance-Wise: Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst and Elle Fanning, all are in good form. Dunst, in particular, is outstanding as a woman who accepts her desires & decides to indulge with a man she barely knows. On the whole, 'The Beguiled' is a letdown.",The Beguiled

22,lasttimeisaw,A double-bill of THE BEGUILED 1971 and 2017,6,21 August 2017,"A double-bill of THE BEGUILED, Thomas Cullinan's source novel is a civil-war drama positing a tantalizing scenario where a wounded union soldier fetches up in a southern all-girls' school, nurtured to recovery by the apparently good-willed women but also subjected to temptations from female gazes and one false move, he will go through purgatory of his sorry life. The 1971 version is directed by Don Siegel, the third of his five collaborations with Clint Eastwood, who plays the Yankee Corporal John McBurney, and is discovered by a 12-year-old Amy (Ferdin, an absorbing talent), to whom he indulges with a peck on her lips, a blatant way to take away a child's first kiss (also pretty provocative by today's regressive yardstick), instantly, what Siegel hammers home to viewers is that he is not a humdinger, and through glimpses of fleeting flashback interleaved into the narrative, John emerges as a congenital liar, flippant and manipulative, currying favor from his petticoat accompany to slough from a possible fall of incarceration, whether it is Miss Marsha (Page), the headmistress of the seminary school, Edwina (Hartman), the virginal teacher to whom he claims his attraction, a nubile 17-year-old student Carol (Ann Harris), who is sexually active, even the slave Hallie (Mercer, a defiant soul hampered by her identity), cannot evade his come-ons. The advent of a hot-blooded albeit bedridden male inevitably causes an erotic disruption among the exclusive distaff clique, whose members are circumspectly secluded from the battlefield merely outside their perimeter and sexually repressed, for pert, callow girls, they are inclined to project John as a perfect specimen of their untested sexual allure versus the opposite sex, in the cases of Edwina and Carol, one is the prudish committed type and the other is a wanton nymphet. But the most complex character amongst them is no doubt Miss Marsha, whose incest past and subliminal lesbian proclivity get a full treatment in the audacious script and visual presentation, the latter is even coalesced with a flagrant religious connotation to soup up the film's maverick idiom. When the crunches arrives, a man's conceit in his potency is punished by blunt castration and signifies a rude awakening of the priapic worship. On top of his virile stallion credence, Clint Eastwood imbues a cunning, almost overweening facade which audience isn't familiar with, not cut from the same cloth from his hard-boiled tough-guy legend. Geraldine Page, emboldened by her matriarchal gravitas and demanding onus, doesn't shy away from any extraneous intrusion (the Union and the Confederacy alike) and builds a palpably beguiling tension through the mind games she plays with Eastwood yet holds the rein from stem to stern in unyielding resolution of taking the escalating situation in her own hands. Elizabeth Hartman, the fragile Oscar-nominated actress whose premature demise was a harrowing tragedy ripe for cinematic transposition, brings about something equally tangible and visceral as she is bedeviled by the discord between a man's promise and his action, but still holds out the last remaining benevolence out of her own impressionable nature. Crowned BEST DIRECTOR in Cannes, Sofia Coppola's remake is an aesthetically beguiling psychological intrigue, superbly recreates a mystical Gothic quaintness in the closing days of the civil war entrapped within the terrain of a majestic mansion of the antebellum south, which certainly is a scintillating upgrade from the 1971 version's sepia retro flair. But story-wise, Sofia's script not only eviscerates the role of Hallie (which is a double-edged sword since she claims that out of the respect of this sensitive issue, she doesn't want to tread lightly, but also can be easily accused of racially insensitive), but also leaves no allusions of all the taboo issues tackled in Siegel's movie, lesbian kiss, incest depravity and of course, that inappropriate kiss between a grown-up man and a teenage girl, are outright sanitized, and in fact, the whole story has been strenuously internalized, for instance, John's transgression, where is given a plausible justification in Siegel's film, is carried out in a slipshod manner, indicating that it is nothing less than a spur of horniness. Atmospherical over dramatic, it is beyond reproach that Coppola opts to tell the allegory with her own agent, but unfortunately, the resultant impact doesn't meet up with expectation, especially when juxtaposed with its far more entrancing antecedent. Nicole Kidman intrepidly takes the mantle from Ms. Page, and actualizes an extremely sensual sponge-washing scene with Colin Farrell's less forthcoming and more sympathetic portrayal of a soldier turns paraplegic when he is subjected to an ambiguous retribution out of the necessity of saving his life. Kirsten Dunst and Elle Fanning don't make a splash in the shoes of Hartman and Ann Harris respectively, save Oona Laurence, whose Amy, precisely captures a child's malleable mentality.So, the jury is out, the remake is humbled by the original, which is quite a shocker because on the paper, Coppola's feminine sensitivity seems to be more adept to parse this age-old gender axe battle than an action-inclined Mr. Siegel, again there is no sure thing in the film industry, and that is exactly why it keeps us intrigued every time.",The Beguiled
23,Hellmant,"Not as memorable, or as well made, as Sofia Coppola's best work.",8,6 July 2017,"'THE BEGUILED': Four Stars (Out of Five) The new acclaimed drama from writer/director Sofia Coppola, who just became the second woman ever to win Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival (for this movie). It's based on the book, originally titled 'The Painted Veil', by Thomas P. Cullinan; and it's the 2nd film adaptation of the novel, following one in 1971 (which was also called 'THE BEGUILED'). The movie tells the story of a wounded Union soldier, during the Civil War, who seeks help at an all-female Southern boarding school, which then leads to bitter sexual rivalries, between the women, over his presence. The film stars Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst (in her 4th collaboration with Coppola) and Elle Fanning. It's performed well with critics (mostly) and it obviously did very well at Cannes. I mostly enjoyed it as well.John McBurney (Farrell) is a Union soldier, in Virginia (during the Civil War), who's wounded and seeking a place to hide and recover. A young girl finds him, and takes him back to the all-female school where she lives. The women there are not used to a man's presence at all, and they're reluctant to help an enemy soldier. They take him in anyway though, and comfort him. Which eventually leads to bitter sexual rivalries between the women.The movie is very dark, and disturbing in places. It basically plays out the way I expected it to though, so it was kind of predictable for me. The performances are decent, and the direction is good. I don't think the film is nearly as memorable, or as well made, as Sofia Coppola's best work though ('LOST IN TRANSLATION' or 'THE VIRGIN SUICIDES'). I think she was much more deserving of a Best Director award for those films, than for this. Still it's a quality movie that's worth seeing I'd say.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/mxz-nUpMk6Y",The Beguiled
24,paul2001sw-1,Slow and artificial,4,9 April 2020,"Sexual starvation affects both a wounded Union verteran and the teachers and pupils at a finishing school for young women in America's south in Sofia Coppola's civil war drama. The film begins in a mannered fashion, and remains superficially genteel until suddenly it is not. Some of the cinemtography is also a little weird: for example, there are two scenes of a woman looking through a telescope where it's not clear what she's looking at or even (because of how the scene is shot) that's this is what she's doing: I still can't figure out what these scenes were (in this form) were supposed to be doing in the film. The film's biggest problem, however, is neither of these two things, but rather it's pretext. The tension comes from the sense of isolation, yet the impact comes from setting a tale of lusts and violence in such a refined backdrop. But there's never any plausible attempt to reconcile the two: how, if the women are really self-subsisting without regular contact with anyone outside, they have good food, can launder their immaculate clothes, and so on. It's not even neessary for the plot they have so little contact with outside; but the result is unsatisfactory, a story set in a world that appears closed for no other reason than that the screenwriter (also Coppola) chose to make it so. I watched it without interest or belief.",The Beguiled
25,MOscarbradley,Even better than the original,9,21 July 2017,"Something rare; a remake that is actually better than an already outstanding original. Sofia Coppola's film of ""The Beguiled"" may offer a slightly more pro-feminist take on the subject than Don Siegel did but otherwise it's business as usual; the plot is very much the same and the creepy, Gothic feel remains unaltered though this time there is a much darker streak of black humour running through the picture. Against the aggressive sexuality of Clint Eastwood and the hysteria of Geraldine Page and Elizabeth Hartman we have a much more subtle and subdued Colin Farrell, now a potential Irish mercenary fighting for the Yankees, as much a victim as a seducer to Nicole Kidman's steely, and still gorgeous, headmistress and Kirsten Dunst's tremulous spinster not to mention the kind of little girls whose idea of fun is probably pulling the wings off butterflies.The pace, at least for the first two-thirds of the picture, is deceptively slow until all hell breaks loose and the film gets nicely sanguine. Coppola handles these tonal shifts with considerable assurance, (she won the Best Director prize at Cannes), and draws superb performances from her small cast. Farrell, in particular, has seldom been better and both Kidman and Dunst are bodice-rippingly good. It's also gorgeously photographed by Philippe le Sourd with frame after frame resembling old prints brought to life. Of course, this won't be to everyone's taste. Anyone expecting an action picture or a conventional horror film will be bitterly disappointed. This is an art-house movie that has sneaked into the multiplex and I loved every minute of it.",The Beguiled

This remake of the Eastwood/ Siegel classic removes much of the gritty edge and tension while retaining the same basic story and structure, a move which ends up neutering the narrative a significant amount and actually makes the entire affair seem rather pointless, to an extent. That's not to say it's terrible or even bad, in fact it passes the time and is both directed and acted with a subtle yet significant passion mixed with a steady professionalism. It's never dull but it's also never exciting, either. The events are depicted in a calculated manner and the piece is devoid of almost any emotion.

27,dromasca,the enemy is not what we believed,8,8 August 2017,"Director Sofia Coppola has built a name of herself clearly distinct from the one of her illustrious father by describing the world of women, their fears and tragedies, their anxieties and ambiguities, their relation with the world of men and the results (in many cases tragic) of the clash of cultures between Venus and Mars. I expect any of her movies, wherever and whenever the story is set, to deal with these themes. The Beguiled is not exception to the rule, it even goes farther and digs deeper then her previous films.The movie is based on a novel by Thomas Cullinan which was already brought to screen in 1971 by Don Siegel with a cast that included Clint Eastwood and Geraldine Page. However, it's not a remake but rather a different interpretation of the story, told from the point of view of the community of women gathered in a school for Southern girls in Virginia by the end of the Civil War, who save the life of a wounded Yankee soldier they find in the wood near the premises of the school. The whole story builds around the mixed feelings of distrust and human compassion, desire and sexual awakening, social and cultural differences between the wounded soldier (Colin Farrell) on one side, and the school principal (Nicole Kidman), her assistant (Kirsten Dunst) and the other girls on the other side. That was time of war and that was a war that changed America, in which social and class taboos were broken. The characters came to revelations not only about the nature of the enemy but also and most of all about themselves.I liked the way the story was told and the characters developed, with the exception of the character played by Elle Fanning who is supposed to play a key role in the change of pace and perspective in the middle of the action, but offers few arguments excepting her age and appearance. All the other actors - Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, and especially Kirsten Dunst give fine performances. Dunst especially grows into a fine actor undertaking more complex roles. The story building is carefully supported by actors work, by the sets (the mansion that hosts the school, the woods around with the nature threatening to take over the building same as the realities of the war threaten the close universe of the girls school), the background sounds of the war. The characters keep a useful dose of mystery for themselves, none of them is a saint or a full devil. They are human in extreme conditions, war made them political enemies, nature made them enemies in the war of sexes, but they find out that the enemy is not what they believed - for the good and for the worse. This story of reprieved passion that turns into historic thriller and horror works well under Coppola's screen direction. Do we still need to remind which of the Coppolas?",The Beguiled

31,tabuno,A Great Period Mood Piece,9,10 January 2019,"4 July 2017. Director Sophia Coppola has created a non-sleazy period mood piece. The ambiance, the period acting performances, the psychological and emotional nuances between the female characters in regards to Colin Farrell's Union soldier character are top notch. This is definitely not a horror movie nor a mystery movie and shouldn't be seen or evaluated as such. Instead this is a period drama thriller. The misty atmosphere, the cannon shots booming in the far distance, the twisty, vegetative landscape, the darkened interior rooms lit with candles all contribute to a fascinating evolving mood movie as the human interactions, the sexual overtones, the sudden changes in circumstances arise.Four minor distractions that may be observed occurring a little ways into the movie are the odd use of the telescope and the sudden transition to Ellie Fanning's character leaving the soldier's room without the audience being allowed to be aware of the conversation that occurred. There is the almost brand new looking pump that seemed out of place in a deteriorating yard. Finally there is the telescope itself from which the audience only gets a view that's not viewed from a telescope's lens' perspective.Coppola has fashioned a sort of Melancholia (2011) meets Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) meets Closer (2004) meets Wait Until Dark (1967). This movie is specific to a specific audience interested in experiencing a slowly evolving psychological thriller and as such it does a great if not a completely perfect job.",The Beguiled
32,nairtejas,Capsule Review: The Beguiled,6,21 October 2017,"At first glance, The Beguiled looks like a book (The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje) that I abandoned after struggling through 60 pages. But then, after few minutes, the story of the arrival of a wounded soldier into a girls-only seminary during the break of Civil War in the US becomes beguiling. With sexual tension in every frame after the beginning, the film highlights how the presence and the subsequent involvement of an opposite sex can influence the lives of a group of sexually underfed ladies and in turn give rise to a cold competition despite the people involved being au faith with the possible repercussions inclining to the negative. Director Sofia Coppola uses subtlety as her main weapon as she narrates the story of these women and a man and creates a terrific cinematic experience out of their primal mannerisms. Watching Colin Farrell speak impeccable English, and Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst, Elle Fanning and the rest of the ladies reply to him cordially is a pleasant experience if you ignore the social references and deductions that you can later fill Twitter with. The underlying tease in the plot is what makes The Beguiled a rewarding watch but somewhere in the middle things happen so quickly you would think Coppola was in a hurry to film a kissing scene. The inevitable happens and the film goes where you guess it would go when you first see the way Farrell's character makes acquaintance. TN.",The Beguiled

That causes a bump, following a twist in the tale, all comes to halt.A simple and nice drama. Best picks for the roles. But Kristen Dunst did not sync-in with the rest of the girls. Nice clothings too, a perfect recreation of the mid 19th century. I enjoyed it, good for watching at once, but I bet those who watched both the version would go for the old one.

35,cruise01,Slow and boring but great performances,6,14 November 2017,"The Beguiled a movie about a Yankee soldier (Colin Farrell), who gets rescued by a group of young girls led by Nicole Kidman. A movie about lust that takes over and jealousy that will cause tension between the girls. Kirsten Dunst and Elle Fanning fall for Farrell's character, which the jealousy is their only enemy when other girls fall for the only guy in the movie. The film is okay. Sofia Coppola was able to capture some great performances with the cast like Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst, and Elle Fanning. Sure, there are some weird moments like Farrell's age and Elle Fanning, who looks like she is in her mid teens and they are both falling for each other. But when he is the only man in the house and the only one they seen for a long time during the civil war era. The plot is also decent. It is very slow moving though. And at times it can be quite boring. One thing that I felt like is the movie could have been trimmed down for a shorter length. Director Sofia Coppola did take her time capturing some long shots of the estate house or the landscape around the area. And throughout the movie, the same shots are shown again for a long period of time. Some of these scenes could have been trimmed down. And the movie never does pick up besides moments were Farrell's character is losing it after an incident which he loses trust in the girls. But he is running around the estate trying to manage it. Overall, The Beguiled is a fair film. The cast is great and the performances are good. Plot is slow and decent.

While I can't say that the acting performances are ""bad"", per se, there is no dramatic ""meat"" behind the roles that render them meaningful, producing a rather boring two hours of cinema.For a basic plot summary, ""The Beguiled"" sees wounded Confederate soldier McBurney (Farrell) rescued by a young girl (Oona Laurence) and taken in to her women's/girls school run by Miss Martha (Kidman). As the soldier recuperates, awkward dynamics form between him and the women, especially teacher Edwina (Dunst) and the teenaged beauty Alicia (Fanning).For a film that has no action and very little mystery, ""The Beguiled"" will succeed or fail based on the quality of its character dynamics. The film was highly touted as having an predominantly women cast and directed by Sofia Coppola, so one could reasonably assume it would create some great male/female tension or facilitate those themes. While the film does indeed try to do that, I never felt like it worked...at all.Instead, what I found was a slog where very little appreciable events or drama occurs over the course of the runtime. I am rarely bored at the theater, but this one produced that effect on me. I kept waiting and waiting for something of substance (either physical or emotional) to happen, but it just never did.I think that a reasonable comp for ""The Beguiled"" would be ""20th Century Women"", and that was a film I really enjoyed. In that movie, also very female-centric, I could see exactly what the characters and themes were trying to accomplish. I didn't (or couldn't) crack that code in ""Beguiled"".",The Beguiled
37,eddie_baggins,A pretty to look at drama that falls down in its later stages,6,21 February 2018,"One of the most unexpected reimagining's to come along in some time, Sophia Coppola's The Beguiled, a remake of the little known 1971 Clint Eastwood film of the same name, is a handsomely crafted and well-acted tale that sits somewhat in the middle range of Francis Ford Coppola's daughter's eclectic mix of feature films.Set 3 years into the American Civil War of the 1800's, Sofia Coppola's film is drenched in southern gothic atmosphere and impending dread as Collin Farrell's runaway and injured Union Corporal John McBurney is taken in by Nicole Kidman's stoic seminary matriarch Martha Farnsworth, which as to be expected creates quite the stir in this now rundown and far from glorious young ladies seminary filled with child, teen and middle-aged woman.The Beguiled makes no attempt to hide what it is intended to become, from the moment Oona Laurence's Amy finds John wounded in the surrounding woods of the house you get a very clear sense of what lays ahead and while Coppola does a great job leading up to the inevitable mood change of the house, once the big moment comes, the film falters quite badly in its final hurrahs.The tension and repressed feelings that lay in wait in Miss Farnsworth's house during the films initial and middle stages gives way to a rather over the top and slightly unbelievable procession of events that Coppola's immaculate production design, cinematography and cast can't quite overcome.A true ensemble piece, no one actor is the pure centrepiece of The Beguiled and all well-known leads handle themselves well. Farrell is as good as his been in some time as the not always likeable but somehow charming McBurney while Kidman and Kirsten Dunst are fine as the other older cast members. Younger cast members Elle Fanning (once more type cast as the brooding teen), Australian Angourie Rice and the aforementioned Lawrence are all also good, continuing on Coppola's well-established reputation as a fine director of talented performers.It is a shame then the well-paced and often believably palpable film falls of the rails in the later stage, as we're left with a film that feels like it was close to becoming something special, rather than an impressively constructed but forgettable and cold gothic tale.Final Say - A step up from Coppola's terrible The Bling Ring, this is a curious choice of film for Coppola to bring to life but one that suits her female oriented and dialogue driven repertoire and at the end of the day, The Beguiled is a pretty to look at distraction and a finely acted one but one that's very far from Coppola's most esteemed works.3 plates of mushrooms out of 5",The Beguiled
38,TheMovieDiorama,The Beguiled offers quaint sumptuous thrills amidst an average screenplay.,7,20 June 2018,"Critics lapped this up like a cat devouring milk, and to be honest I can see why. Coppola becoming the second woman to win best director at Cannes was certainly a boost in attracting praise and audiences, and without a doubt her direction was the stand out in what is an extremely slow melodrama. A Union Army corporal is found wounded by a group of girls from a secluded school, where sexual tension rapidly rises. Depicting how a man utilises flirtation to feed off the attention that the female characters give him. Female empowerment in films is becoming more prevalent as time dwindles by, the need to be politically correct has never been so critical. Coppola manages to be realistic with her characters which is somewhat refreshing. The girls succumb to the corporal's presence as they giggle and flirt back with him. Then, after a spontaneous passionate event, the girls naturally turn against him and act as one unit. Illustrating the savagery and ruthless behaviour of one man in a well-mannered society. Gender politics aside, Coppola just about retains enough tension to keep you captivated, particularly the third act. Where she struggles is with the characterisation of the women, with many of them being forgettable aside from Miss Farnsworth and Edwina. The harmonious community would've felt more apt with some elevated clashes between these characters, I'm not saying they have to resort to bickering but jealousy should've been used with more innovation to create tension. Kidman, Farrell and Dunst gave strong performances without dominating the screen. Costume design looked authentic and suited the 1860s plantation house that these characters resided in. But it's Coppola's directing techniques that allows the opulent slow-built thrills to be produced. Deliberately gentle, carefully constructed and meticulously thorough. The Beguiled, much like its title, ensnared me into Coppola's seductive direction and the cast's engrossing performances. Oh, and that last shot was mesmerisingly powerful.",The Beguiled
39,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Terrific craftsmanship, even if Coppola's choice to be restrained has its drawbacks",7,13 November 2017,"Although this story of a wounded Union soldier ending up in the care of several beautiful women at an all-girls' school could go to a sadistic place full of dark intrigue, filmmaker Sofia Coppola brings a surprising amount of restraint to her interpretation of Thomas Cullinan's novel ""The Beguiled.""Set in Louisiana during the Civil War, the story creates this unusual dynamic in that a house full of women have ""captured"" a man in distress, Cpl. John McBurney (Colin Farrel), who has badly injured his leg. Setting the events into motion, however, is housemaster Miss Martha's (Nicole Kidman) conscious choice not to turn him over to the Confederate army, a decision she claims to be about Christian morals, but has a strong but subtle undercurrent of selfishness.Sexual tension and southern manners are at odds with each other both in terms of story and tone throughout the rest of the film, but Coppola toes the line gracefully in terms of the sex. She steers well clear of pulp and baser romance instincts to keep the suggestion of the women and girls' interest in and seduction by (and of) McBurney alive and lingering just below the surface, rather than taking over the frame.The subtlety comes alive in the performances. Kidman, Kirsten Dunst as Edwina, the direct object of McBurney's desire, and Elle Fanning's cunning Alicia are the highlights, keeping Coppola's tone firmly in place by conveying the subtext without physically caving into it except where written in the story.In many ways, McBurney's presence is a contagion, or more fitting for this film – a dead or corrupted limb that one desperately wants to keep but would be best and safest to swiftly amputate. Although the value of welcoming in someone from the outside world would appear healthy for a rigid all-girls school, McBurney's charms and even more simply his presence prove dangerous. Coppola essentially comes at this story with an aggressive but honest feminist mindset; ""The Beguiled"" turns out to be a rather ideal artistic study in the toxicity of traditional masculinity. Coppola's fierce control over how much to let the story boil produces both a desirable effect and a degree of disappointment. ""The Beguiled"" doesn't evolve into the film it constantly feels as though it's going to become, but a lot of its artistic and intellectual value comes from that choice to keep it mild-mannered. The story doesn't always hold interest, but that allows our attention to focus on the performances and especially Coppola's direction. Details such as costumes, as with most of her work, are vividly filmed. The craftsmanship of ""The Beguiled"" merits consideration among the year's finest work and certain among Coppola's catalogue. Few auteurs have clearer principles guiding both their filmmaking and the stories they choose to tell. If ""The Beguiled"" were a bit more riveting, it would find a more mainstream audience. Instead it's the kind of film easier to admire than it is to enjoy.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Review for more",The Beguiled
40,paul-allaer,Massive contrasts in tone and texture compared to the 1971 movie,7,4 July 2017,"""The Beguiled"" (2017 release; 93 min.) brings the story of Corporate John McBurney, a wounded Yankee soldier. As the movie opens, we are reminded that it is ""1864, Virginia, 3 years into the Civil War"". While a young girl is collecting mushrooms in the forest, she finds the Yankee soldier, badly wounded. She is able to get him up and walk with her to an all-girl boarding school. Most people have fled, but there still remains the head mistress, a teacher, and 5 students. The arrival of the wounded soldier causes quite a commotion... What will become of the soldier? and of the women? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Sofia Coppola. Not counting her Netflic 2015 holiday special, this follows her 2013 ""The Bling Ring"", which was okay but certainly not her best work. Here she brings us a remake of the 1971 movie of the same name starring Clint Eastwood and directed by Don Siegel. If you've seen that film, you will appreciate the massive contrasts between the 1971 movie and the 2017 remake. The 1971 movie was brought with the subtlety of a bull in a China shop. It was an action movie! Coppola wisely goes a completely different direction (even though the story lines have more or less remained the same). Coppola brings a far more nuanced picture, and one that I find ultimately more believable, and more enjoyable. It helps immensely that she has a great cast: Colin Farrel (as the Yankee soldier), Nicole Kidman (as the head mistress), Kirsten Dunst (as the teacher)m and Elle Fanning (as one of the girls). The photography (from on-location in Mississippi) is pure eye candy. There isn't a lot of music in the film, but the little there is, is credited as ""Score by Phoenix (inspired by Montiverdi's Magnificat)"". (Coppola's husband Thomas Mars is the front man of the French band Phoenix.) ""The Beguiled"" opened this past weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati on not one, but two screens (a rarity). The Tuesday July 4 early evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay, but it wasn't packed. Coppola won the Best Director Award at this year's Cannes Film Festival (only the second woman to do so). If you like a Civil War drama that is brought with a female touch, I'd readily recommend you see out this 2017 version of ""The Beguiled"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",The Beguiled

That does make It even more interesting and makes more sense about how a mundane story was done so masterfully.So Collin Ferrell plays a Yankee soldier wounded on the battlefield and somehow makes his way to a house filled with southern belles who Nurse him back to Heath.This situation gets complex when it's obvious that these belles had not had the company of a man in a long while and the wounded soldier takes advantage of that, so he can stick around, which does not end well for him at all.The Beguiled is a strange set up as it does end very dramatically, but it does not do it with a dramatic flair that you would expect. The tone of the movie was this same slow pace burn all the way and it never changes And you know what!? Perfect! Because the slow burn only points out more just how messed up the whole situation became. It's a situation where I find it hard to feel sorry for the main character or sadden for him (And Ironically I would have tried the same thing, even now after seeing the film).

Colin Farrel, Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst, Elle Fanning, are all very good actors but it was not necessary to make this film, the effort of all is absolutely useless. The film does not convey anything, despite the indisputable personal charm of the actors. Once finished, you ask yourself, is that all, when the movie starts? As for the high degree of eroticism (the film is 15 restricted for ""strong sex scenes""), it is admirable but it is totally missing, there are no hot scenes (or the version in cinemas is a censored one...) Still, I understood the message, I read it ""through the rows""(because of what we see on the screen, it is not obvious) or, better said, I imagined it myself, because I have some experience of life and I know how things are with love and hatred, with the invisible line between these two concepts (you never know where one starts and where the other ends...), I know something about the ""endless war between men and women,"" I experienced it for a few decades, on myself...

43,dfranzen70,"Arty but lacking drama, focus, or a point",5,16 November 2017,"Sofia Coppola's remake of the '71 Clint Eastwood western The Beguiled didn't completely click for me. I guess I had it in my head that it would be more of a new-wave feminist take on the original plot, but I found the movie – despite strong performances – to be tedious and frustrating to watch. It's a shame; a lot of talent was wasted on both sides of the camera.Nicole Kidman plays Miss Martha, the headmistress at a girls' school in Virginia in the middle of the Civil War. One of her charges, searching for mushrooms for dinner, comes across a Union soldier named Corporal McBurney (Colin Farrell), who's badly wounded. Miss Martha agrees to take in the Yankee – they're in the middle of Confederate territory – give him medical attention, and allow him to convalesce at the school. The young corporal is charming and graceful, and the ladies know that if they return him to the woods, he wouldn't last long. And if they waited until their own troops stopped by, they might want to take McBurney with them before his leg has healed.It doesn't take long for McBurney to win the hearts and minds of the lasses, which include teacher Edwina (Kirsten Dunst) and student Alicia (Elle Fanning). Each lady has designs of some sort on their new guest, but who's playing whom? I haven't seen the Eastwood film, so I didn't know how this one was going to play out – until less than halfway through, when I got a pretty good idea. McBurney doesn't actively play each woman against the others, but his manipulations aren't exactly subtle, either. Farrell does a fine job, but it really feels like ages go by before anything beyond passing character interactions develops – and even then, the focus is mainly on Martha and Edwina. There's little action to speak of and even less suspense. The result is a movie that feels amorphous, even useless.",The Beguiled

She says her movie is based on a 1966 book by Thomas Cullinan, which, by the way, is the book that the Clint Eastwood movie was based on. I'll let you decide what to believe-I got the feeling that Sofia did not like the 1971 version. Anyway, Colin plays a Union soldier in 1864-during the Civil War-that is found near some trees by a girl from a nearby seminary for young girls. He is wounded in the leg so she takes him to her school, where Nicole is the headmistress. Kirsten is a teacher and Elle is one of the students. A dilemma pops up amongst the ladies about whether they should turn Colin over to the local Confederates or keep him around-you know, for yard work and stuff. There are repressed desires on the girls part and Colin uses that to his advantage by flirting with each of them, one by one. Jealousy is the next emotion that travels through the girls and of course-if you saw the earlier movie or read the book-it eventually leads to trouble for Colin.

45,drownnnsoda,"Boasts lush visuals and an impressive cast, but a fairly one-note retelling",6,17 July 2017,"""The Beguiled,"" based on the scant-read Thomas Cullinan novel that was made into a 1971 film starring Clint Eastwood and Geraldine Paige, focuses on a Civil War-era southern women's boarding school whose female dynamics are thrown dangerously out of whack when an injured (yet dashing) Union soldier ends up on their doorstep.To be clear, I am a major fan of the 1971 Don Siegel film. I also happen to be a major fan of Sofia Coppola (I count ""The Virgin Suicides"" and ""Lost in Translation"" among my favorite movies of all time). When I heard she was redoing ""The Beguiled"" (with Nicole Kidman and Kirsten Dunst, no less), I was thrilled to see what a contemporary retelling of the story would offer, especially with the cast she assembled. The result? ""Middling"" is probably the best way I can describe it. Some reviewers/critics are lauding the film as a political 21st-century feminist masterpiece, which is odd because I never got the impression that the Cullinan novel or the '71 film were pro or anti-feminist, and to be frank, I didn't get the impression that Coppola's retelling was either. This film slightly bends the narrative toward the perspective of the women in the house, but the dynamics between them and the male infiltrator lead to the same bubbling of chaos that ends in a topsy-turvy denouement that is the epitome of Southern Gothic if it's anything at all. What makes this material great is that it is rife with complexities operating from the most base human level: sexuality. Nothing is quite so black-and-white, and especially not that. This was the case for the novel, the 1971 film, and this version as well. Coppola's angling of the film toward the female cast does offer a great deal of room for exploration, and the audience is subjected to the daily limbo these women inhabit. This means a plethora of gorgeous meditative shots of the prim Southern belles plodding about the plantation: They keep watch with a spyglass, hang-dry laundry in the wind, and lethargically tend to the overgrown garden while the faint sounds of artillery echo in the distance. It's effective to a point, but Coppola pushes these moments at the expense of the characters themselves. Each of the female characters—the post-adolescent ones, at least—wear their repression on their sleeves, but what else is there? The cast here is admittedly fantastic, which makes this a shame; and while the chemistry at times felt odd to me, the performances on their own merits are strong. Kidman is reliable as always, stern and graceful; Farrell is sleazy and gentlemanly, and has the right amount of sex appeal here; and Dunst hits the right notes in terms of both being inflamed with desire and crippled by naivety. Fanning brings humor to the proceedings playing a nymphet-ish character, while the younger cast are commendably impressive. Even with the strength of the cast, I left the theater feeling like the film was truly not the sum of its parts. If Coppola's sole aim here was to give us a more female-centric retelling, then I suppose she succeeded, though to what end, I'm not quite sure—especially given that her version more or less follows suit to both the source novel and the 1971 film. For as much as the audience is exposed to these various female characters, we don't necessarily get to know them any better for it. The film boasts an impressive cast and lush visuals, but I'm not convinced it's as thematically or narratively unique a take as Coppola seems to think it is. 6/10.",The Beguiled
46,davispittman,A well crafted film,8,30 December 2017,"Sofia Coppola's The Beguiled (2017) is a very well crafted film. This is a remake, and though I have not seen the original, I will still say that this serves as a worthy version. I have nothing to compare it to, nut just taking the film on it's own, it stands as an intriguing watch. The positives really rack up here, from the smart direction and attention to detail to the fine performances. The A list cast really brings their all here. Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst, Colin Farrell, and Elle Fanning all star, and I thought each actor was correctly chosen for their character. Dunst plays a very lonely, out of place woman who is desperate for a man's touch in her life, and she plays that persona very well. Kidman plays the head of the house, the matriarch, and she is also somewhat smitten with Farrell's character, but not so much as Dunst, I also loved her performance. And Fanning plays an older teenage girl in the house who go after Farrell and wants his attention badly, and I think she also gives a good performance. Farrell of course plays the man in the middle of all of this, a wounded Union soldier they've taken in. He handled his character well and brought it hard, especially in his really dramatic moments. The writing is done very well, the dialogue enriches both the characters and the story. The one and only complaint I have for this film is the length, I could've stood for it to be a bit longer.

The younger girls are excited when they see new people, regardless of their origin or affiliation. They quickly adjust to him, regard him as just another human being, and grow fond of him. Things are a bit different for the three older women. The school mistress is a little hesitant and limits her interactions to taking care of his wounds.

""The Beguiled"" is a dark film which has as a setting one of the darkest moments in history. It also shows how society's rules are broken too quickly, resulting in consequences few are prepared to face.It's hard to force nature, and hormones play a powerful role in the behavior of these characters. There is also the need for survival, and Miss Martha represents the brain and common sense here, but the film gives an opportunity to all the girls to show their personalities and resources to fix the situation. The movie ends, and we're still wondering what might be coming, how their lives have been changed; we just know it probably won't be o.k.The movie appears to move slowly, but it never drags.

50,jadepietro,A Film That Does Beguile Its Audience,9,1 July 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5 ) GRADE: B+ THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A lively re-telling of a Gothic melodrama that camouflages its silly trappings with excellent acting and masterful direction.SYNOPSIS: A wounded Union soldier seeks some Southern comfort.JIM'S REVIEW: ""One man...seven women...in a strange house!"" That was the original tag-line for the 1971 Southern Gothic melodrama, The Beguiled, starring Clint Eastwood. That film was a guilty pleasure of sexual repression during the Civil War (against the free love vibes of the seventies). Its viewpoint was a warped war of the sexes, eventually leading to Mr. Eastwood's emasculation. The anticlimactic ending remains the same in both Ms. Coppola's version as in Mr. Siegel's (which is far as removed from the novel's denouncement as possible). But this remake tones down the melodrama completely and turns the film into a serious and thought provoking drama.Writer / Director Sofia Coppola has taken Don Siegel's cult film and given it a revisionist spin. Her battle of the sexes tale has streamlined its story, eliminated any vestige of the slavery issue and a backstory of incest and child molestation. She has made some major improvement to delineate the characters and their ulterior motives and altered what was once a half-baked tale of carnal lust, setting her new story on a slow simmer. All traces of pulp have been removed and the film slowly, sometimes too slowly, percolate in its own juices. No longer an overly melodramatic tale of unbridled passion, her historical drama is a re-imagined world where willful spinsters and manly scoundrels thrives. Ms. Coppola's film version focuses on the manipulation of the male upon the female rather than the reversal of this premise. These ladies take female empowerment to a whole other level.￼Colin Farrell plays John McBurney, a wounded Union soldier. Found bloody, handsome, and weaken, he is taken to Miss Martha Farnsworth Seminary for Young Ladies to recover from his injuries. The war raging outside its gate seems like a mere afterthought compared to the battle- lines that are soon drawn inside this less-stately mansion. ￼As John is nursed back to health, he begins to bond with this brood and uses his sexuality to his own advantage. The place is a hothouse of wanton desires and sexual tension as the ladies ogle and obsess about this hunk of man-bait, although Miss Farnsworth (a superb Nicole Kidman) will have none of that behavior under her roof. After all, there must be a price to be paid for illicit sex and sinful thoughts. Vengeance has its sweet reward, or does it? ￼Mr. Farrell is perfectly cast. His interpretation of McBurney is more sexual predator than victim. He knowingly acts to charm and ""beguile"" his female prey. Those objects of desire include Alicia (Eli Fanning), a lusty teenage Lolita, Edwina (Kristin Dunst), who may or may not be his true love, Amy (Oona Laurence), a sweet innocent child who soon realizes that evil does exist in this world, and Miss Farnsworth herself. The acting is solid throughout, especially Ms. Kidman who plays the pious headmistress caught in a power struggle of conflicting emotions. From her subtle come-hither glances and nervous reactions in some scenes to deliberate controlled manipulation and righteous indignation in others, the actress creates a character whose words never are quite in sync with her actions. This keeps the audience guessing about her real motives throughout the film. The scenes involving her and Mr. Farrell serve to highlight the rivalry between their characters and up the ante of psychological suspense while downplaying some of the strained and palpable sexual tension.￼Ms. Coppola directs with authority and skillfully ratchets up the tension. She painstakingly shows the mundane aspects of 19th century life and leisurely shows that period with memorable images that help to establish her characters and the era with where they survived (a close-up of a child's treasure trove of inanimate objects, wisps of cannons' black smoke in the distance against a dusk sky, scenes of proper ladylike behavior from evening prayer groups to classes on proper etiquette). There is such poetic clarity in her vision which makes her film all the more compelling.Production values are high. Philippe Le Sourd's cinematography is stunning. His use of candle- lit corridors and shadowy corners add to the overall atmosphere of this Gothic house of horror. Lovely period costumes by Stacey Battat add that subtle touch of Southern genteel respectability and the dissonant music score by Phoenix feeds into its penny dreadful material source.￼The film is all romantic notions turned on its head and sexual restraint stretched to the limits. It hides the pulp beneath its splendid veneer with Ms. Coppola's strong direction and the fine acting from its cast. The moviegoer remains involved from the start. The Beguiled does just that and more.",The Beguiled
51,bkrauser-81-311064,Not as Beguiling as it Needs to Be,7,19 August 2017,"Civility has a way of eroding in times of war. Chastity, honesty, discreetness, Christian charity are all forms of social graces, hard enough to profess and demonstrate in the best of times. But to the southern belles of the Farnsworth Seminary for Young Ladies, the Civil War is its own set of challenges. Three years into the war, the women (seven in total), have seen their plantation reclaimed by nature; their chickens and garden being pillaged by soldiers and their peace repeatedly interrupted by cannon fire.Enter Corporal John McBurney (Farrell), a Union soldier injured by a gunshot to the leg. He's brought back to the Seminary by the young innocent Amy (Laurence) who believes he should stay until his wounds are mended. Martha (Kidman), the school's headmaster at first is conflicted but she ultimately decides to let him stay as, ""a most unwelcomed guest."" As time wears on and the women become accustomed to his presence, jealousy and deceit threaten to overrun the girls' lives.The Beguiled, based on ""A Painted Veil"" a novel by Thomas P. Cullinan has proved controversial over the last few months. It competed for the Palme d'Or at Cannes and won the Best Director award making Sofia Coppola only the second woman to win the award in the festival's history. Despite this, audiences aren't quite sure what to make of this movie and for a multitude of reasons. Fans of the 1971 Clint Eastwood version seem to be upset that the entire story's pulp has been squeezed out; while fans of the book are upset the black characters and prominent racial themes are completely non-existent. It doesn't help that the trailer sells The Beguiled as a Gothic thriller all but guaranteeing that casual audiences, unaccustomed to Coppola's filigreed style, will be confused and bored.But to those who know exactly what they're getting into, The Beguiled provides an ambitious, beautiful if flawed and overtly simplistic tale of lust, jealousy and repression. Its meditative pace and moody atmospherics sticks to the movie like the airless humidity of a southern summer. The very purposeful break from the cinematic norm (static camera placements, lack of soundtrack, repetitive visual motifs) boils down the story to its bare essence.The Beguiled resembles a fairy-tale in this way, or rather a deconstruction of a fairy-tale. The characters make their decisions, and more-or-less face their moral consequences. But because we're cloistered in a creaky, old antebellum mansion along with them, the film almost coaxes you to make excuses for them. John isn't strictly speaking predatorial neither is Martha strictly speaking a dragon lady nor Edwina (Dunst), John's love interest, as innocent as she seems. You want to like them all, or at the very least want to understand why they're pulling at one particular thread of the story over another.It all makes sense if the goal is to highlight the ridiculousness of sexual repression. While not as explicit as mockery or as pointed as satire, the plot of the film nevertheless uses a unique mix of wit, restraint and expressionism to convey the ugliness of a certain social climate. One that's untenable in a climate of violence that threatens to creep up at the doorstep with gun in hand.Yet audiences may find a hard time looking for the forest amid the trees. The film's natural restraint and relative comfort in keeping things opaque, threatens to rob the characters of their agency. The ladies are trapped in their chores and prayers while John, an Irish deserter conscripted for a $300 payday, is trapped every which way. Thus The Beguiled makes the mistake of not being a movie of choices but rather the lack of choices.Such themes were explored more honestly and with more rigors in Coppola's The Virgin Suicides (1999). That said there's no denying the foreboding beauty of the director's dreamscapes in this film. And thanks to the skillful work of Dunst, Kidman, Farrell, Fanning and cinematographer Philippe le Sourd, there's a chance you may never forget it.",The Beguiled

55,rockman182,The Beguiled (2017),7,24 June 2017,"Sofia Coppola is without a doubt my favorite female filmmaker. I have to see The Virgin Suicides again but everything else from her has been immensely enjoyable. Through watching her films its easy to locate connected themes and her films are chock full of memorable female characters. I never read the novel nor have I seen the original film with Clint Eastwood. So outside of what little the trailers showed, I didn't know what to expect. After watching this I can happily say I really enjoyed this film. Coppola is at the height of her craft once again.The film is about a ""Yankee"" northern soldier who is found wounded in the woods during wartime Civil War. He is taken in to an all girls school, where the headmistress and other members are at first very hesitant with giving hospitality to a man from the other side of the country. Many of the females get accustomed to the man and soon start to develop feelings for him. His motives aren't completely known which provides for an air of mystery and danger. Apparently, Sofia Coppola took some liberties telling the story for this adaptation but I found out it to be a slow brooding and engaging film which also happens to look stunning.The acting is great on all fronts. Nicole Kidman has had a great resurgence the past few years. Farrell and Dunst are at the top of their game. And of course, Elle Fanning the alluring beauty does so well as a slightly lust filled youth vying for the feelings of the wounded bed ridden man. As with nearly all of Coppola's shots the film is beautifully shot. Framed shots of the house and the woods and the interior decor take you straight back to the era. The characters are so well mannered, this is actually quite a polite film (apart from one or two outbursts from Farell). There is a lot going on internally with the three female leads (and Farrell for that matter) that needed exploring. However, I think what we have adds to the air of mystery.Its hard to figure out what character motivations were. The Beguiled still remains to sit pretty on its surface. The film portrays female infatuation followed by hate and doing what needs to be done to take care of a threat. The film seems muted in color and dark for most of the picture. The costumes and set design are so great, Coppola is so perceptive to how her films look. Like most of her films this is easily accessible as the film doesn't delve too deep into female sexuality or violence. This is definitely going to need a rewatch as it has the hallmarks of a film that grows on you.7.5/10",The Beguiled

The man in the house changes everything. The writing credit is very strange as the movie is actually a remake of a Clint Eastwood film of the same title which was based on a book.Like most Sofia Coppola movies this looks great on the screen. The cinematography is outstanding. The shot on film production has a richness not found in most recent movies. Of course some scenes are too long. There are too many shots of the exterior of the house and never ending booms on the sound track in case we forget there is a war nearby.There seem to be a few unintentionally funny moments. ""Get me the saw and my anatomy book"" is one of many funny lines. The performances are uniformly very good. Nicole Kidman slips into her native Aussie accent on occasion. The costumes are terrific but maybe a bit fresh and clean considering there's a war going on. The movie is in limited release but worth seeking out.",The Beguiled
57,swilliky,A suspenseful and dark Southern Gothic film with great direction,7,12 July 2017,"Sofia Coppola delivers a dark and suspenseful Southern Gothic horror film that explores the genre and feminine charm. When Amy (Oona Laurence) stumbles across the wounded Union soldier Corporal McBurney (Colin Farrell) in the woods, she brings the man back to her school for girls to help him recover from his leg wound. Miss Martha (Nicole Kidman) runs the school that has scenes the departure of its slaves and most of the students. The last remaining teacher Edwina (Kirsten Dunst) wishes to leave this place but with the Civil War raging nearby sees no hope of escape. The young and restless Alicia (Elle Fanning) is especially vicious when she first meets the wounded soldier, telling him about the warning symbol of a blue cloth that will bring the Confederate soldiers. The corporal admits that he is cowardly and jumps at the chance for brandy.Amy seems to think the best of her discovery and Martha takes the man in, sewing up his wound and washing his skin. Edwina also takes a particular attraction to the man especially when McBurny awakes and compliments her in his thick Irish accent. Other girls like Jane (Angourie Rice) don't trust the Yankee presence and tells tales of the awful deeds by Union soldiers. Martha thinks about turning him in but when Amy and Edwina appeal to her Christian nature, they decide to allow him to stay until he recovers. The new presence changes the behavior of the women as Edwina starts dressing up more and young Marie (Addison Riecke) brings him a prayer book as a gift. Alicia sneaks up to give him a kiss during the nightly prayers. He stays up in the music room unable to move and hides up there when the Confederate soldiers march by stopping to check that everything is all right.

58,tonypeacock-1,Why? The 1971 original is perfectly good.,6,22 September 2021,"I initially intended on seeing this film during its initial cinema release in 2017 but I watched something else and missed the run. Hence a 2018 cable TV viewing.During that hiatus I caught up with the 1971 version of the film starring Clint Eastwood and enjoyed it. I was therefore underwhelmed with Sofia Copola's version starring Colin Farrell as Corporal McBurney, a soldier from the enemy Northern forces in the U. S. civil war in the nineteenth century.McBurney is discovered wounded by a young student of a girls school. They find it in their Christian values to hide the soldier whilst he recovers from his leg wounds. As the film continues several of the young girl students and indeed their teacher Miss. Martha (Nicole Kidman) develop a crush on their new housemate complete with giggles at the dinner table and revealing dresses etc.As a film viewed without comparing to the 1971 version it isn't bad in terms of casting, performances and photography. However I failed to see what this version 'brought to the table (apart from a one-legged Irishman eating dodgy mushrooms). Other films are improvements or slight variants on their original films but I failed to see that here. Is it just another example of modern day economics in the film industry rehashing old ideas at a fraction of the cost of new ones?",The Beguiled

60,Dan1863Sickles,"Sensational Southern Gothic -- Steamy, Sexy, Sinister, and Suspenseful!",8,10 July 2017,"A wounded Yankee soldier, abandoned by his comrades in arms, finds shelter in the far more welcoming arms of a cluster of lovely, (and lonely) southern maidens, deep in the Virginia woods in the American Civil War. It all seems just like a dream -- until it turns into a nightmare.What a sensational, steamy drama Sophia Coppola's BEGUILED really is. This gifted director excels at creating atmosphere and sensuality out of shadows and whispers. She delights in working with actors, and she gets sensational performances out of both her seasoned veterans (Nicole Kidman and Kirsten Dunst as the starchy, grown up school teachers) and out of rising stars like Elle Fanning (the most tempting teenage temptress imaginable) and even out of the bright young child actors who play the younger girls. (Oona Laurence as Amy, the one innocent in a house full of vengeful, venomous, vicious women who mask their poisonous desires with the sweetest of smiles.)This story and setting were so much up Sophia Coppola's alley that I knew the movie would be a smash hit. What really astonished me though was the discipline with which she tells the tale. So many vital scenes are set in shadows, half-light, and that can be frustrating. But then after half an hour I realized the point. You can't see these people because they can't really see each other. It's impossible to tell who is who and what is what until it's far too late. And that's the point!Now I think it's a mistake to say this movie ""ignores"" slavery or sentimentalizes the South just because there are no black characters on the screen. This movie is not Gone With The Wind. When the Yankee soldier invades the girls' home, they fight back just like Scarlett and Melanie do in Gone With The Wind. But look at how they fight back. Look at the levels of cruelty, hypocrisy, and deceit the older women use to destroy the man they all lust after in secret. Look at how they lie to him and exploit him sexually. Then look at how they build him into a sexual threat, (to cover up their own sexual desires,) mutilate him, and dispose of his carcass like so much garbage. This movie says plenty about slavery. These girls are hardened by the war, but in a sense they were hardened long before that. What they do to the corporal is exactly what they'd do to a black slave who got out of line. Their motives and methods are the same. Even Sophia Coppola's ""mistakes"" reinforce the point. Though the movie is set in Virginia, she repeatedly cuts away to dark, menacing trees filled with Spanish moss, to show that this story could be set anywhere in the slave states, from Richmond to New Orleans. And look at how she cheats on the food situation. It would have been so easy to make the girls ""victims"" (like Margaret Mitchell, William Styron, and countless others) by dwelling on the food shortages and physical misery of the doomed and guilty south. Instead Sophia shows the girls serving smoked ham and apple pie with cream -- not because anyone was really eating that well in Virginia in 1864, but because that is the ""good life"" that slavery made possible. And the girls (like the heroes of the Confederate army) are willing to mutilate and murder in order to keep it! This movie says plenty about slavery, the south, and human nature -- but it never preaches and never takes sides. Sophia Coppola is a national treasure, I hope she makes many more movies with her sensational company of actors!",The Beguiled

The performances are all good, even if Nicole Kidman's southern accent slips into australian way too often.It does, however, feel very emotionally empty. Whatever emotion I was suppose to feel during certain scenes just wasn't there (the most emotion I felt was when Colin Farrell threw Henry the turtle). For a long time it feels like the story is going nowhere, until it takes a turn in the last thirty minutes, and even then it starts to drag.There's also one moment towards the end where one of the characters implies something, and I thought it was pretty smart how they managed to get the idea across in just one line of dialogue, but then the characters just proceed to explain very unambiguously what they're talking about, which was very disappointing.Still, the film is very well made and it definitley has a lot more going for it than againts it, it's just a shame that none of it will really stay with me.",The Beguiled

While Sofia Coppola sure knows how to create atmosphere, I think she failed to emphasize on the characters, especially in regards of their development, motivation and conclusion. While there was a little bit of all of that, I felt we were missing a lot. Its almost as if that was intentional. Also I felt there was no real climax. Acting wise it was good. Colin Farrell was ideally cast and delivered an intense performance. I think his character was also the only one that was fully fleshed out. Nicole Kidman had a lot of very good moments and she was absolutely perfect for her role. Kirsten Dunst gave probably the best performance of the cast and one of her best performance in her entire career. Elle Fanning was also good but I felt her character was the least developed one.

67,statuskuo,A Drag,4,8 July 2017,"The issue with charisma comes into question when you have Colin Ferrell, a Union soldier at the mercy of an all-girls boarding school. The answer, he has none. I understand why Sofia Coppola felt compelled to remake this story. Since having watched the original, it probably insulted her womanhood. Because the 1971 Don Siegel version dove deeper with greater insight into catty women and the crushing pain of jealousy between them. What Coppola DOESN'T understand is that women are this vindictive and petty. She is too close to these women to ever make Elle Fanning's character the whore she's suppose to be. And she also lacks the strength to make Nicole Kidman's horrifically casted matron of the house, an insane woman. In fact, we know less of her now then we do at the beginning of this slog of a film.While its beauty is not in question, the film looks stunning, as if a painting came to life, the girls at this school lack any...life. It's a drudgery for them to even exist. The '71 version was a lot of questionable decisions. For instance, Geraldine Page's decision to not alert the Confederate soldiers about an enemy in their midst is tense. Yet, in this one, it plays in the distance. Or the manipulation of the soldier into the hearts of the girls. Again, it seemed Coppola seemed to believe a modern sensibility made more sense (which it doesn't).This feels much more like a page from a novel rather than the entire novel. Francis Ford Coppola, whether he admits it or not, had the help of Robert Evans to bring the entire story of ""The Godfather"" into legendary status. It's a shame that Sofia has not such a foil to prod her to do the same. This was a grind to sit through, since...as Sofia has admitted, was a response to a female perspective of the same incident. So I suppose she sees it as a painful drag as well Watch the Don Siegel version for what a real filmmaker can do with a touchy subject matter.",The Beguiled

69,HEFILM,quiet dull lifeless and ultimately pointless,3,2 July 2017,"This seems like an attempt by Coppola to make a commercial film--though odd as it's a remake of a commercial failure. But these days anything made once is worth remaking.The film is almost totally bland in every way. There is virtually no music or camera movement and in a story that takes place largely in confined spaces this is a deadly choice.It generates no momentum as it goes on and on....Coppola has no feel for the material and key changes from the original leave plot holes--or if you prefer character motivation holes.If you've never seen the excellent original film the basic story, even in this watered down version, could hold your interest, but it better because this is a very polite version of a story that is far from polite. She leaves out the slave character from the book and original film and this is a mistake, all the mistakes like this seem to be for the same kind of reason for fear of the film being about racism or about sexual attraction and danger or about war and what it does to people. For fear of the film being about anything that might offend anyone.So she spends her time in dimly lit interiors with mostly very polite low toned interactions between people and a music score this is a short collection of drones that seem like music left out of some 80's horror movie score.The movie manages to have no point of view, no central character and so it's just hard to care.This is being sold as a thriller and she certainly has no feel for that, the best shots in the movie are some moody southern hanging vines and such,but when she rarely goes in for a shot of anything other than a bland medium to long shot it seems for little purpose.She seems afraid to break an egg to make an omelet is one way to look at it. The actors seem like they'd like to break out and get into the movie but she refused to let them. Now is this a matter of editing--where to bring the length down key things got left out--perhaps, as some scenes seem to have no connection emotionally for the people in them. Someone will be enraged, then in the next scene perfectly calm as if nothing happened.Or is it in some failed attempt to do something different than the original. Problem with this is when there is some perfect choice already done well then what do have you as options? Less good choices or just no choice is what the do here.If she wanted to make a film of the novel she hasn't, as the book is told from different characters perspectives this could have made for an interesting, who is really seeing the truth type of film. If that was done you could see that one girl thinks the soldier is just trying to exploit them for his advantage--sexual and or otherwise, while another girl might seem him as friendly and haplessly driven by extremes of the head mistress. This element exists to a small degree in the original film but here it's nowhere to be seen.The film feels and mostly looks like a watered down shot on video rather cheap TV production from 30 years ago, made by people who don't care much for the story but are doing it because it's something to do and let's just get it done with as little fuss as we can.A waste of time.",The Beguiled

71,CineMuseFilms,a beguiling exercise in form over substance,6,17 July 2017,"When movie's form and substance are not in harmony the strain can be obvious. With a stellar cast, superb cinematography and magnificent American Gothic period setting, The Beguiled (2017) has uncompromisingly beautiful form. In terms of substance, on the other hand, its characterisation and narrative interpretation are underwhelming.The storyline is uncomplicated. A wounded Union mercenary Corporal John McBurney (Colin Farrell) is found in the woods by a young pupil of a nearby prestigious girls school. She helps him limp to the school where the headmistress Miss Martha Farnsworth (Nicole Kidman) agrees out of Christian kindness to provide shelter from the Confederates. The slave servants have fled and the Civil War rages, but the school stays open for a handful of orphaned girls. McBurney knows that his charm and seduction skills are vital to his survival as he smirks privately at having landed in a crinoline paradise compared to the battle outside. The ladies are aflutter at his presence and an atmosphere of repressed sexuality and jealousy simmer below the surface. But he is too clever for his own Irish charm as he tries to worm his way into too many beds. When caught out for his duplicity, the sweet angels of charity exact their revenge.With a story rich in narrative potential and star-power like Kidman, Farrell and Fanning, you might expect a delicious thriller melodrama with characters of depth, complexity and nuance. But instead we find a flat narrative with two-dimensional caricatures devoid of emotional expression. Apart from McBurney's angry outburst at having been thwarted by a mere handful of women, nobody in this film seems to feel anything more urgent than how the plates might be arranged for dinner. Piques of jealousy, fear, passion, feminist rage? – none of seems to have made the final cut. Perhaps it's a Gothic affectation that upper-class Southern ladies enjoy French grammar and music lessons accompanied by exploding cannonballs. Whenever there is hope for an exciting narrative twist, the ladies spontaneously assemble for a posed composition of exquisite elegance and formality as if beckoned by a painter for a portrait sitting. Seeing this the first time is a visual delight; seeing it multiple times displays a level of artifice that distracts from an already slow narrative. Gothic atmosphere is usually full of tension but here it's more about smoky mists and mood lighting that varies between dark, darker and darkest. What could have been offered as a triumphantly gruesome finale is instead played out as deadpan politeness in a sewing lesson for once rich young white ladies.Opinions differ widely about this film. Some will have seen the 1971 version or read the source novel, others of course will see it cold. Perhaps it is meant to be a deliberately restrained feminist Gothic noir interpretation. However, despite its high-quality inputs this film is more about form than substance. It has not risen to its potential.",The Beguiled

Often the differences are fairly slight, the Hurt Locker is a good example. But this reworking of The Beguiled is quite different than the original starring Clint Eastwood. The women in this southern plantation-like school have lost all their slaves, they ran off as the Civil War continued. The head mistress, Nicole Kidman, is looking after the few students still in residence when one finds a wounded Union soldier, Colin Farrell, in the woods. The movie is all about how the women instinctively react to this soldier and how he instinctively reacts in turn. They try to maintain their southern hospitality, but only Ms. Kidman, Ms. Martha, can truly hold it together, and in the end even she loses her perspective.What's great about this film is how the director, Ms. Coppola, doesn't glamorize or idealize anyone.

Instead of beginning with John's discovery, if we had been given an introduction of the harmony, balance, etc., of the mansion life and it's female world such would have stood in interesting contrast to the story. And a brief moment or two of John in battle, facing death, would have serviced well. Some broader paint strokes might have been used in emphasizing three stages of female life represented by Miss Martha, Edwina and Alicia; e.g., different degrees of wisdom, restraint, charm (or lack of it) and approach all the while there existing a similar desire. Plot wise, I like the amputation as punishment, retribution and/or just-desserts but did not think it had to be a product of Edwina's intrusion into Alicia's lusts. The accident giving rise to the amputation would have been better worked as an intentional act caused by an unidentified resident.But for the above, this could have been Oscar material.

76,themadmovieman,"Despite bursts of good tension, The Beguiled is a dull watch, and a real missed opportunity",7,21 July 2017,"This film was a bit of a disappointment. A remake of a 1971 drama and featuring a premise that has so much possibility for thrilling and intense drama, I was left very underwhelmed at the emptiness of The Beguiled. Despite a relatively engaging central portion where the drama works, it's a generally slow, quiet and empty film that doesn't develop at a consistent rate, making for an uneven and frustrating watch.Let's start with the film's opening act, which is arguably one of the most boring set ups I've ever seen in a film. I was intrigued by the film's premise at first, and was looking to see how the tension between the women in the house would grow when a man is thrown among their ranks, but what I got was a pretty lifeless and pointless half hour of dull conversations interspersed by brief moments of character and story development.What's even weirder about the film is that it's so brilliant at bringing about drama quickly and efficiently. The entire dynamic of the story and the relationships between characters can change on nothing more than a look, and Sofia Coppola does an amazing job to make a few brief moments play a big, memorable role in the film as a whole.However, what happens between those moments is tedious. What disappointed me most about The Beguiled's opening was just how inefficient it was, winning in brief moments of brilliance, and then wasting long periods of time as the characters aimlessly walk up and down the house not really helping to spur the tension that's at the centre of the story.And that's where my other big issue with this film comes in: it's just not tense enough. No, I'm not looking for suspense and nail-biting thrills, but what I felt was really lacking here was an underlying level of subtle tension between the characters. The story's premise of women being pit against each other over a man is reminiscent of the brilliant Chinese film Raise The Red Lantern, however the difference in delivery is enormous.In that film, the tension and rivalry between the women is palpable, and it plays a central role in establishing the drama of the story as a whole. In The Beguiled, on the other hand, there's no sense of underlying tension. While its middle portion does manage to bring a good degree of intrigue and excitement by focusing down and putting two characters head to head, the majority of the film is really missing out on the dark and brutal rivalry that should be the fundamental centre of the entire story.It's an issue that then continues into the final act, rendering what should be high drama incredibly underwhelming on numerous occasions. In that, The Beguiled is a film with a fascinating premise, and one with excellent promise for genuine tension, but it falls down as an excessively slow and quiet movie that misses the opportunity to make something powerful and riveting.",The Beguiled
77,kaptenvideo-89875,"More welcoming than Coppola's usual, but it feels also less complete than her usual",7,1 August 2017,"Over her directing career, Sofia Coppola has won quite a lot of praise, arguably the biggest of which came this year in Cannes where she was announced the best director for The Beguiled"". It feels a lot like a political decision – after all, it marked the first time in 50 years a woman won the award, and only the second time overall. The Beguiled"" doesn't really feel like her best work for many, including me. Most like ""Lost in Translation"", I personally was most deeply touched by Somewhere"". (I know, such a surprising choice.) But it surely is one of her most crowdpleasing films. Just think of the story and possibilities coming with it. US Civil War, Southern girls' boarding school. Sheltered young women take in an injured enemy soldier. As they tend to his wounds, the household is fast taken over with sexual tension and rivalries And all this in rich southern Gothic like sauce. Written and directed by Sofia Coppola, The Beguiled"" is based on Thomas Cullinan novel which has already been brought to screen in 1971, with Clint Eastwood as the male lead. This time, it's Colin Farrell vs Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst, Elle Fanning and the others. What could go wrong? Well it is not bad. It's just too short and underdeveloped to be really really good – you know, Cannes winning director worthy. While I really appreciate films being less than two hours for a change, there's really too much exciting content here to be contained in only 93 minutes. Thus, the third and final chapter of the story is noticeably weaker than what comes before that. One shouldn't save time on building atmosphere, characters and relationships when all these are essential to the story. To Coppola's credit, she's still a fine director. By which I mean she's good technical director: everything feels well composed and thoughtful. The movie as a whole also feels somewhat less emotionally distanced and dry than her usual, because she's playing with different genres and manages to offer delicious mix of southern Gothic, drama, subtle black comedy, erotic thriller, even horror. And, of course, you can't have ""dry and distanced"" in the middle of this lush southern setting. All this is supported by able cast consisting mostly of women, Farrell in the middle of it all is not the most important player. It's much more intriguing to watch all the women circling around him, nobody usually in the forefront, but almost everybody out there to stake a claim. The acting is mostly about nuances and subtlety, so there's a lot of enjoyment to be had from just watching and witnessing. I am especially happy for Nicole Kidman doing another good role in a good movie recently (after Lion""). She's appeared in so many forgetful and mediocre projects in this century that it's hard to get excited about her appearing somewhere anymore. The bigger parts also go to Dunst and Fanning, who are playing to their usual strengths, one shy but heartful, the other one kind of dangerous and lustful. All this works, and works well. In a way, Sofia Coppola's movies are like Jim Jarmusch's. if you can't invest yourself in her slow moving stories mostly interested in mood rather action or being easily digestible, you can feel bored or underwhelmed soon. As mentioned above, The Beguiled"" is somewhat more welcoming than her usual. But as a whole, it feels also uncomplete, or less complete than usual. But I'm, of course, still happy about having seen it, and Coppola continuing to make movies.",The Beguiled
78,WalkdenEntertainment,"Innocent, until betrayed. Introducing, The Beguiled...",5,9 January 2019,"The year is 1864 and it is during the American Civil War. Not far from the ongoing war, we have a mansion of young ladies being schooled by their teacher, Miss Martha (Nicole Kidman). Among the cast, we also have Elle Fanning as a student and Kirsten Dunst as a teacher.One day, one of the students is out picking mushrooms and comes across wounded Corporal John McBurney (Colin Farrell). The corporal is weak and desperate for help. The young girl agrees to take him back to the school so he can heal and recover. As the Corporal recovers and begins to know the girls better, sexual tension, jealousy and betrayal begins to grow within the school. Is the Corporal an enemy? A manipulator? Or just a handsome, respectful charmer?As I began to watch this film, I noticed the film's aspect ratio felt incorrect. It made me curious and worried about my TV! After the film ended I discovered that director Sofia Coppola chose the 1.66:1 aspect ratio because she wanted to make the film feel claustrophobic. The different aspect is creative but it personally didn't make me feel claustrophobic or particularly different for that matter.I enjoyed the film's story and the mystery behind our leading man. The film managed to create many questions from the get go that can only be answered as the film goes on. The film's audio track (along with the Aspect ratio) packs plenty of detail. Even within the opening scene where a young girl is collecting mushroom, you can hear explosions and gun shots from the far distance, the crunching of the sticks under her feet and the crickets in the air. The detail throughout the entire film was a pleasure to hear. From a visual point of view, the film is pretty dull. Some the main colours heavily used include dark grey and dark army green.While the film is interesting, the way it's told often jumps from scene to scene far too quickly. For example, our teacher calls the girls to eat dinner and just as they begin to eat, the teacher will then say 'it's time to go to another room to sing and pray'. The film never seems to stay put for any solid duration.Another odd part of the story is the overall lack of security and protection for our leading girls. Even as viewers, we know the man is a potential risk and could be dangerous. The teacher also warns the girls to lock the door and stay away. But for some reason the girls ignore, or worse, use the key that has been left in the door, letting anyone enter the room and have conversations with the Mystery Corporal. Why didn't the teacher just put the key around her neck or hide it? As for other funny odd moments, the list goes on.I did enjoy how the film felt like two films in one. The 1st half was full of mystery and the 2nd half had the reveals and final outcomes. The film, however, is incredibly predictable long before the film's finale.Overall, Beguiled tries to bring a suspenseful film filled with mysteries and curiosity. That being said, the film's pace seemed to jump quicker than a frog in a pond. Many times I found some of the character's actions slightly unacceptable and silly. The film's aspect is creative, but again not knowing in advance made me think something was wrong and it felt distracting instead. As a film, it's not awful and it's not great, it's just not one for me.4.9/10

79,trublu215,The Cast Elevates This Well Made but Wholly Unnecessary Remake,6,21 June 2017,"Don Siegel's The Beguiled is an underrated gem of the 70s that went pretty much unnoticed for quite some time. So when Sofia Coppola announced that she was remaking the film, it was kinda surprising. Surprising because who in the hell would remake The Beguiled and kinda not surprising given the subject matter and timely political message that it could push. Despite it being such an out of left field choice for a remake, the end product is a very well made and perfectly acted film. Starring Nicole Kidman, Elle Fanning, Kirsten Dunst and Colin Farrell, The Beguiled tells a story of wounded Civil War solider that seeks medical attention from a house of women in the rural South. Upon his arrival at the all-women facility, passion and lust become abound when the soldier begins to romance the women one by one. With each relationship he starts, jealousy arises between the women which leads to a shocking act of desperation.Personally, I thought the film was paced very well. It flowed very fluidly and was actually surprisingly funny. Granted, this is a borderline dark comedy at times but it works very well due to the impeccable acting from the cast. Kirsten Dunst gives the performance of her career here and really carries a lot of the film despite her role being somewhat limited considering the impact she has on the film. I wouldn't rule her out of the competition at the end of the year. She really does a great job. Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell also give really tremendous performances that just elevate Dunst that much more. Elle Fanning is as sultry as can be but less impressive because the role is not much different from her character in Ben Affleck's Live by Night. Despite this, the film keeps a genuine tension throughout it whether that'd be violent or sexual is completely up to whatever side of the 93 minute running time. Make no mistake, The Beguiled is most certainly a well acted film but it feels like it is unnecessary. At times it feels a little more political than it needs to be and, a majority of the time, feels like it could have been a better film especially considering the immense talent in front of the camera. Overall, the film is far from being the average remake. It is well paced, has brilliant performances and keeps a steady handle on itself as a potboiler thriller with a hint of dark comedy. It is far from great but definitely worth watching.",The Beguiled
80,Aly200,A Serviceable Remake,7,11 November 2017,"From the acclaimed Sofia Coppola comes this remake of Don Siegel's 1971 original film that starred Clint Eastwood, Geraldine Chaplin, Elizabeth Hartman and Darlene Carr among others. This new adaptation replaces those players with the likes of Colin Farrell, Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst and Elle Fanning in the principal roles.Following the same plot of the original film and the novel upon which both films are based about a wounded Union solider who becomes a prisoner within a girls' school in the Civil War-era South and attempts to seduce each member of the women which ultimately leads to his demise.Coppola chooses her cast quite wisely especially given the legacy of Clint Eastwood being the original film's star. Colin Farrell is far different from his predecessor, but does justice to the role of Corporal John McBurney. Imbuing the role with his trademark Irish swagger and charm, Farrell commands the screen when he interacts with his costars and as he fights for control of his surroundings, the tension ramps up. Costar with actresses Nicole Kidman and Kirsten Dunst are probably the best the actor has with the limited cast list though sometimes the chemistry falls a little flat. The one distracting element of Farrell's performance is his native Irish brogue given the character is an American (it is implied), but there is a possibility the character could be Irish-American.Nicole Kidman and Kirsten Dunst are well cast as the polar opposite women despite their Southern roots of being prim and proper woman. Dunst's Edwina (taking over from Elizabeth Hartman) is the more emotional one of the women at the school whereas Kidman's Martha is the stern and cold matriarch who runs the school. There is a marked difference in the actresses' interactions as the story progresses as McBurney's influence over all the women begins to collide with their wills to resist. Edwina is ready to believe the best of the guest as she falls for him quickly, but Miss Martha remains suspicious and when her advances towards the Corporal are spurned her revenge is swift and cruel. Edwina is also exposed to the lies, but her emotions manipulate her judgment and she is soon seduced again by McBurney but pays a price for her choice to try and leave.Coppola utilizes her camera well as the action is mostly confined to the indoors of Miss Martha's school, but when outdoors the lighting is limited due to the trees adorning the grounds. Inside the school, there is equally dim lighting as the set mostly from the outside light drifting through the windows and curtains or candlelight during pivotal scenes. The director might've gotten the inspiration for this lighting technique from Stanley Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon"" which utilized natural lighting and candlelight.",The Beguiled
81,lorcan-61881,Sofia Coppola hits at it again!!,8,3 March 2018,"If you know me, Sofia Coppola is my favorite director of all time and I was sinful enough to miss her new film, The Beguiled until now and after seeing it's trailer in the cinema, around November, I had to see it but unfortunately, I was forced to wait until last night when it was uploaded to my daily online movie site and I watched it. The Beguiled follows the story of a girls school who find a man who had ran away from the Civil War and when they begin to get too close to him from the isolation of men, sexual tensions soon rise..and murderous revenge!! The Beguiled is a very strange film and I come to wonder why Coppola wanted to do this. Apparently after making The Bling Ring she said she wanted to do something different and I guess she was just like ""Fuck it! Let's make a remake of Clint Eastwood's The Beguiled"" and she did a fare job of it, there was one problem with the film that I had and that was that the film is very boring, just jumping in but the film is quite boring at parts, I'm not saying the film is boring but it drags, alot! but apart from that, The Beguiled is a really good film I think you should see, but it is not one of my favourite films like most Coppola films, sadly!",The Beguiled
82,alfiefamily,Gothic and Atmospheric Film,6,2 July 2017,"""The Beguiled"" tells the tale of several women who are locked inside the remnants of a Gothic looking plantation, trying to survive the Civil War. One of the ladies (a young girl actually), discovers a wounded Union soldier (Colin Farrell) in the woods. She takes him home and persuades the matron of the girls (Nicole Kidman) to heal the soldier and not turn him in to the Confederate army.I won't say much more about the plot, so as not to give anything away. Let me just say, if you watched the trailer, your ideas about what was going to happen would be a lot more inventive and exciting than what actually does happen in this film.The film, to me, certainly has the right atmosphere and look, although the setting looks more like South Carolina or Georgia, than Virginia. The acting is all first rate, especially Nicole Kidman. But there isn't enough in the script to really hold anyone's interest. At 93 minutes, I was left wondering how it was that nothing really happens.Sophia Coppola is a talented director, and she assembles terrific casts, and gets wonderful performances out of them, but I frankly don't think that her screen writing skills are that good. I am one of the few people in this world who do not believe that ""Lost in Translation"" is a masterpiece. I'd like to see what she can achieve using someone else's screenplay.6 out of 10",The Beguiled
83,daoldiges,Interesting To Look At,6,19 May 2018,"This film does have a distinct visual appeal to it, as well as overall solid performances. However, the underlying tension that Coppola I think was going for doesn't really materialize. Instead the viewer is left with feelings of frustration because we know what we're supposed to be feeling, or what we think we should, but the director just can't make it happen. In part this is due to her going for style in place of substance, when these need not be mutually exclusive.",The Beguiled
84,mr_bickle_the_pickle,"A Fine, decent movie. Nothing special.",6,7 July 2017,"First of all, I have not read the book nor have I seen the Clint Eastwood version. All I knew about the movie was the good buzz around the film from Cannes and the trailer. And that's kind of my first gripe. From the trailer I expected it was going to be more a revenge/held captive (ala Misery) kind of story. And its really not at all. And I think it would have been a tad more interesting if had gone in that direction. Also, its being lauded as a feminist movie and while it prominently features a large female cast, they still spend their time in this movie obsessed over a man. And I understand the movie takes place during the civil war. So not only is an older time where the morals and values were different, but also the men were off fighting. So having a man suddenly enter your your home and lives would be kind of exciting. It is easy to see why they take to him so easily. It's just I don't know if I would call it a feminist film since the plot and the characters motivations center around Colin Farrell's character. That being said, I think it was very well acted and I liked the camera work that Sofia did. It still was an overall enjoyable movie. I didn't find myself bored at all. I don't know if this film will have any steam left by the time Oscars come. In the very least it might manage a Best Costumes nod, and I think that's fair. Its a good movie, just isn't anything special. I just cant see myself still talking about this movie in years to come, you know?",The Beguiled

86,Jared_Andrews,A Surprisingly Funny Period Piece on Desire and a Man's Corrupting Influence on Women,8,23 July 2017,"If you've ever wondered how it would look to watch a group of women ranging in age from 12 to 40something all compete sexually over the same man, wonder no more. The Beguiled delivers that, with a twist—the story takes place during the Civil War at a school for girls.As you can imagine, the women and younger girls all behave in a way befitting the old-fashioned version of proper. Their boldest displays of seduction involve putting on a necklace and slightly revealing their self-proclaimed ""lovely shoulders."" I believe exposed midriffs or cleavage-baring tops may have been jailable offenses for women during this time period; I would have to check the history books to confirm that.What I'm saying is the women's displays of sexual pursuit toward this male stranger are hilariously tame by 2017's standards. And that's the point. This story of refined women who are deceived and corrupted by a mysterious male soldier would have been viewed as a tale of cautionary horror tale in the late 1800s. Today much of the movie plays as a comedy.One scene involving the head of household, the oldest woman (played by Nicole Kidman), giving the soldier a sponge bath is pure comedic gold.The execution of the story, while subtle, deserves praise. All actions and subsequent reactions of the characters are appropriately tame. While this makes sense given the subject matter, it does put a cap on the excitement level. The climactic scene is the equivalent of a golf clap, classy and satisfying, but ultimately falling short of wowing.That's basically the movie in a nutshell: outwardly displays of class and grace with clear hints of molten lava bubbling beneath the surface. The characters keep hidden all their visceral urges and thoughts behind a mask of politeness. It's up to the viewers to see through the deception.",The Beguiled
87,scb_coldsteel,A good but flawed film,6,2 October 2018,"Finished the new Sofia Coppola film The Beguilded. I was not a fan of the original Clint Eastwood Edition so my expectations were not very high. Overall the film was exactly what I expected. It had its strengths, but I was really not a fan.It was a very slow burn of a film. Being slow is not by itself a negative, but they're never really felt like a payoff for the pacing. I kept waiting for a reward for my patients but was left wanting. Film definitely wanted to be a psychological suspense drama, but unfortunately it just did not work.The film was a time period melodrama set during the civil war and like most melodramas there was a lot of character conflict. The conflict between the characters was easily the best part and was the center of the film. This of course was because of the great acting talent found in the movie. Acting wise the film really shinned. Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman really delivered great performances. Their acting alone made this a watchable movie. You really felt the conflict build as the dialogue shifted throughout the movie. The directing and cinematography were also very well done. The movie was very well shot and had a haunting appearance. Unfortunately the material and story progression just did not work. The pacing did have a few issues, and the story was a bit underwhelming. Overall a good, but flawed film.

88,BigGuy,Only the press was beguiled,4,20 July 2017,"Before going to see this with my wife, I read some reviews and saw that it was certified fresh on R.T. with the blurb saying pretty good things. It was especially rated favorably relative to the Clint Eastwood version. Sadly neither was true.The quality of the movie seemed inversely proportional to the age of the person involved (with the possible exception of Elle Fanning). The youngest children did the best job, even when they were basically background for what was happening in the rest of the scene. For the older/adult characters the acting was leaden and heavy handed. The seduction was almost comical and incredibly uneven. Kirsten Dunst was apparently directed to be frumpy and boring, which simply doesn't work. Nicole Kidman's character was even more of a mess. With every knew scene I had to wonder how much time had to have passed for her character's behavior to change so much. The kids are forbidden to go into the room, and in seemingly the next scene they are coming and going freely. She hates Colin Farrell's character, then suddenly they are friendly, with a single smile being the seduction.I think the problem is that the beguiling of the women/girls is so terribly clumsy, both in terms of the acting and in terms of the direction/screenplay. My wife and I were both laughing and rolling our eyes when Colin was delivering his lines and the women/girls were lapping it up. In the movie, it comes across as a single thick application of honey, when I'm sure the intent was days/weeks of thin layers. But the movie doesn't show the gradual beguilement, only drastic step changes.The most fun I had with this movie, was talking afterwords with my wife and speculating that a sequel would be more interesting. The children grow up to be serial killers or men. Perhaps one of them is the mother of the Brewster sisters from Arsenic and Old Lace.",The Beguiled

On the one hand, it could have been an interesting take on the original. That version was a bit campy and overheated, its emotions and intentions written all over each scene. What if those were scaled back and we were left with simmering emotions and gentle backstabbing and mysterious intentions? A story that captures the politeness of the south and the demureness of the times but with this unmistakable sexual tension underlying everything. It could work.But it doesn't, not really. Characters feel half-realized, somehow holding back their emotions results in ciphers whose actions seem to take on even more of a plot-forward agency than before. Specific actions happen seemingly at random, rather than being the result of a perfectly cooked setup that boils over. It's all a bit too laconic and Coppola doesn't find a way (like she has in her other films) to make the undercurrents the main current, the repressions the inevitable explosions. It just feels empty.

However, the decision NOT to turn him over to the Confederate Army is made.The word beguiled is kind of confusing here, but if one looks at it as deception then we have a shot to determine what this is all about. But on the other hand it could be looked at the ways the girls are beguiled (charmed) by the sexual appeal of Corp John McBurney. You decide. (probable a little of both) Like I said: confusing.The dialogues of all is respectful and low key. We see that the women take a liking to The Corporal especially Edwina (Dunst) and Alicia (Fanning). As we go on we see the sexual tensions rise, but nothing really happens until one night when Edwina goes into his room and sees Alicia there in the bed with the Corporal and John jumps up, and tries to calm Edwina and they shuffle out to the top of the stairs and John falls down the stairs and his wounds open. It is here later on that things change in the house dramatically. This story could have gone in many directions, but under the direction of head mistress Miss Martha (Kidman) decorum is maintained even though John has taken a more commanding and angry role in the house. But now the women have a problem and want the Corporal to be gone.The story is okay, but there are way too many scenes in almost complete darkness. Even the scenes outside are heavy with dark shadows. Good dramatic effect some might say, but hey, we need to see the characters faces as events happen. The story is slow going to allow sexual tensions to rise. As I said, this story could have gone in many directions, risqué and sexual, but all was played fairly safe. The acting all around is very good, but no one stood out for the Oscar.There is a twist, kinda, and you will be surprised at the deception. Okay, maybe not. (7/10)Violence: Not really.

94,danielharden,Coppola Canne do,6,29 July 2017,"Sofia Coppola is one of, if not, the best female filmmaker working today. Daughter of the legendary Francis Ford Coppola, Sofia has learnt from the best. To make clear, by no means do I mean this in a sexist way, I would think this regardless of gender. I thought the same of Ridley Scott's son when he made the sci fi movie, Morgan, because let's face it, who else would have taught him how to make a sci fi film? Anyway, Sofia Coppola is a great filmmaker in her own right, making such films as Lost in Translation and The Virgin Suicides, earning her own Oscar for writing the former. Coppola's latest effort, a remake of Don Siegel's 1971 film, The Beguiled, takes a different approach, one that would make Coppola the second woman to win Best Director at the Canne film festival. The film takes us to 1864, the American Civil War, more specifically to a school for girls in Virginia, run by Miss Martha, played by Nicole Kidman, and aided by Edwina, played by Kirsten Dunst. When one of the girls stumbles upon a wounded Union soldier, played by Colin Farrell, tensions and paranoia run high as we are left to question who is the Beguiled? The girls or the soldier? The Beguiled is a well constructed film, but whose restraint direction doesn't quite satisfy me personally.The film is extremely well acted from its very small cast. Nicole Kidman doesn't disappoint, playing a very strong leader, but who is also struggling to keep control and protect the girls. Kirsten Dunst also does well if wrongly cast in this film. Edwina is a rather plain/normal looking girl, or at least is in the Don Siegel version, so when you see Kirsten Dunst, you don't really question Edwina's relationship with McBurney. Dunst is a great actress and does well in the role, but because she is a naturally good looking actress, some audiences who haven't seen the original film or read the book, will not question certain aspects they should be questioning. Colin Farrell cranks up the charisma as Union Soldier McBurney. Farrell perfectly portrays the character to keep you guessing as to how genuine he may be. Is he a good man? Or has war made him evil? Or is he naturally evil? So many questions and so much complexity to him and the role. Well done.My personal favourite aspect of The Beguiled, was its classic film construction. From the films opening shot/ title sequence, to the films aspect ratio, the film looks and feels like an old school classic movie. I found this to be very nostalgic, and this will be nostalgic to a lot of older audiences and overall, it's a nice touch to a period piece, perfectly fitting with the films 1864 setting. As well as this, Coppola makes other great directorial decisions in this film; such as the sheer lack of score which created tension and anxiety so well that you don't even notice the film has been borderline musically silent. Coppola wonderfully creates tension in this film whether it is through sheer silence, eye line match edits, the ambiguity of the script, or simply a high pressure situation taking place, Coppola masterfully conjures up unease in the audience that is felt throughout the film.Coppola's approach is one I can appreciate and respect, the ambiguity of the film really leaves the audience guessing, but I personally would have liked a bit more. I understand the point of this film is to show restraint, but as I've heard, the Don Siegel version was rather out there and 'balls to the wall' and so I feel that's the version I want to see. I believe this mainly stems from how I witnessed the trailer, to which alludes to more of an actively tense, action packed horror film. I oddly enough saw the trailer for the first time when I saw It Comes At Night, another film that I feel falsely advertised, although The Beguiled isn't as big of a liar than that film. The trailer for The Beguiled was shown amongst various horror film trailers like IT and Annabelle Creation, and seeing as the trailer implies a dark, horrific and exciting horror film, I understandably felt lied to when actually seeing the film, which is a slow moving period drama, where for the most part, subtext rules over text.Overall, The Beguiled is a beautiful looking movie, well acted by its cast and excellently directed by Sofia Coppola. It's unfortunate that the trailer sold me a different film and was almost damaging to Coppola's vision, but fortunately it isn't as drastic a misdirection as It Comes At Night, so it comes off fine by comparison. Coppola's restrained approach and different take on The Beguiled is the right way to go about a remake, but I just wish it had a little more of an impact to which the trailer implied. The film is charming if a little bit deceitful I guess you could say that the film itself is Beguiled...",The Beguiled
95,ReganRebecca,When women strike back...,7,3 July 2017,"Sofia Coppola's latest is a period piece set during the American civil war in Virginia. While wandering through the forest scavenging for food, a young school girl comes across a Yankee soldier. Seeing that the man is severely wounded and thus no danger to her, she brings him back to the private girls school where only a handful of pupils, the headmistress, and one teacher, have settled down to wait out the war. The girls and women, having been left alone for so long without male attention, are quick to throw themselves in the path of such a devilishly handsome romantic man, while the man himself, John McBurney, is all too willing to seduce and be seduced in the hopes that he can wait out the war in this cushy harem of white cotton clad ladies. Though she has an Oscar for writing I've always found Coppola to be at her best with her directing and that's very true of The Beguiled. You can tell she had a blast with the time period and the costumes because she luxuriates in the atmosphere. No shots are wasted and all are beautiful. The soundscape in the movie also plays an incredible role. There are a lot of things happening off screen (the war for one) but we hear it in the sound of the booming canons that disrupt the girls as they set about their work. The film is also an ensemble piece, but while there isn't a weak member among the cast, Coppola favourite Kirsten Dunst stands out as a fragile and repressed teacher whose youth is quickly wilting away, and Nicole Kidman is hilarious as the commanding no-nonsense headmistress. The trailers for this give away too much of the plot in my opinion. If possible it's best to see this blind and let Coppola's slow atmospheric's and dark humour take over. A short sharp piece, well made and worth seeing.",The Beguiled

True to form, Coppola once again deceits the viewers into believing they've watched something rather stale and uneventful, when in fact the unsaid and the hinted upon is more powerful, substantial and engaging than you were aware.A circumspect approach to a contained setting and a suggestion to a wider reality, for both the historic background and for the characters themselves, the Beguiled urges the viewer not to immediately praise or dismiss it, but rather to delve on it(s) subject matter(s), digest them and talk about them. That is why once again Coppola proves herself to be a singular auteur.",The Beguiled
98,barbagvido,Would be better if they took some liberties with the story,7,15 November 2017,"The Beguiled is a remake of a 1971 thriller. It's directed by Sofia Coppola and stars Nicole Kidman, Colin Farell, Kirsten Dunst and Elle Fanning. It tells a story about a wounded soldier during the American Civil War coming across a small all-female school. When he's in, the jealousy and suppressed desires within the women come to the surface.I thought the original was decent, but definitely overlong and at the end a bit unsatisfying. This one makes same problems, but it's better shot and acted, so that ultimately makes it just slightly better than the original. The story is essentially the same. Near the end, it starts looking like it's finally gonna separate itself from the original, but it's quickly shrugged off and we get a same old unsatisfying ending again. This time just with a bit more of an impact. The reason it's so unsatisfying is that you really expect hell to break loose and it looks like it wants to shock you, but it's really tame and kinda uninteresting. Still, this remake feels tighter than the original with around 10 minutes less of run time. It's beautifully shot with some great performances, especially Elle Fanning and Colin Farell. And while it does provoke a few thoughts, it doesn't really stick with you.While it's a bit better done than the original, it's still the same story, that's itself not much. With some changes, it might have been better. This way, it's just same old.",The Beguiled
99,tkarlmann,Why is everything so Dark?,6,26 November 2018,"Every scene in this film was dark to a fault. There is reason for this. It was so dark, that the lighting affected the movie. This is, of course the way the Director chose to do it. I must say, all things considered, I had no issues with the cast or the acting, but I'm a Clint Eastwood fan, so I prefer the Original, 1971 version of this story. Knowing that, and also liking Kirsten Dunst and Nicole Kidman. I thought I'd give this a watch. EVERY single scene in this film was dark, dark, dark! Perhaps this is where the Director is in her own life. Funny thing is, she is quoted in Wikipedia as saying that she was happy to get away from the dark (mood) of her last film! Please let someone take this Director on a Holiday to someplace well lit!!!!UPDATE: 01 Apr 2021: I now like this version better because I cannot stand to see Clint Eastwood 'beguiled'! The Story was just one downward spiral, with one simple question: Why did ""the Corporal"" visit the bed of that way-too-young little tart, when he could have had Kirsten Dunst's Character?Also, why was there no ""Mushroom Expert"" listed in the credits?",The Beguiled
100,jburtonprod-802-759029,When PC Dictates Art.,4,19 March 2018,"The original 'The Beguiled' was a problematic movie. It was full of moral ambiguity and didn't really seem to have a fully defined third act. It was, however a richly detailed character study of some flawed and damaged people and it did have some elements of a mini-tragedy. I'm guessing for the sake of political correctness a number of it's layers were stripped away. I'm mean what would people say if the dashing young scoundrel Corp. McBurny kissed a 12 year old girl not once but twice? We can't have that! And the incestuous relationship of the headmistress with her brother? Shame on you for even thinking about it. We have a black slave who isn't the wisest person in the household and through flash back we find was violated by the same brother. Now, that's a very problematic character. What's Sofia Coppola's solution. Cut the kiss, cut the incest and cut the entire role of the black slave out off the movie. She also cut out the reveal that showed McBurny was lying about how he got injured, which made everything he said suspect in the original and provided some moral highground for what happens to him. There was a fever dream the head mistress has that is full of eroticism and Judaeo-Christian symbolism. That's all gone, too. Even the death of a turtle was underplayed in this. Heaven forbid we depict someone killing a turtle!!! Well, all those problematic bits are cut out and as a result nobody is offended. Welcome to Art via proactive political thought policing. Nobody is offended and nobody has any reason to engage in what going on in the movie. This is our future if we can't get the easily offended to shut and grow the hell up. What's left? A very creepy 'girl power' movie where we see that a bunch of woman could effectively subdue, cripple and even murder a man if they all work together. I'm assuming that was not Ms. Coppola's intent but I honestly have on idea what we are meant to take away from this movie. Like I said, the original 'The Beguiled' was problematic. In making it safe for the ever so sensitive new millennium palate Coppola gets rid of those problems. In doing so she produces a movie that is totally lacking a third act, has no guts, no depth and no message. There is nothing to hold this movie together and no reason for it retain your attention. The production of this movie is very nice. It's eerie and atmospheric and the direction is good, hence the 4 stars. I wish Sophia Coppola had retained some writers to take this project head on instead of writing it herself and stripping out what soul there was in the movie. Is this the same person who made 'The Virgin Suicides'? That director would've been a natural for this remake. Ms. Coppola needs to regain her original audacity and willingness to take on difficult subject matter if she wants to reemerge as an artist.",The Beguiled
101,themovieparadise,Dull,4,19 July 2017,"This movie is boring as sh*t. It just is. It's a slow film, and I can appreciate slow movies. Alien is one of my favorite movies, and it's incredibly slow. What makes a slow movie work is that it has a pay- off at the end. It's slow, yes, but it all builds to something. And when you have good pay-off, then you can not only accept the slowness, but you come to appreciate it. With The Beguiled, there is no pay-off, at least for me. I'm not going to spoil the ending, but what it amounts to is not worth sitting through the movie. The film is only an hour and a half, and yet it felt more like two and a half hours. That is due to the terrible pacing. I found myself constantly looking around the theater, barely engaged with what was going on on screen. Yes, the visuals are stunning. The cinematography is excellent, and the costume and production designs are impeccable. But there's only so much that beautiful cinematography can account for, and it did very little to save this movie for me...",The Beguiled
102,cappiethadog,Sofia Coppola's hertigo,9,18 February 2019,"Miss Martha saw him naked. The headmistress can't look at herself in the vanity mirror, just yet. She knows that desire has taken refuge behind those eyes, shaping a look of lust right back at her. A water bowl that sits atop the dresser gives Martha something to distract her in the interim. The rebel woman doesn't need visual confirmation on what she feels. If only her patient was a homely man; somebody she could pity, a disfigured man who poses no intrigue. If only her patient didn't look so familiar. Martha Burnham(Nicole Kidman) tells herself it's the Christian thing to do. She is the nursemaid, a Good Samaritan helping this wounded man that Amy(Oona Lawrence) discovered in the woods. But now, she splashes cold water on her face, meant for bloody hands, not sinful thoughts, then looks up and fixes her hair, trying to even her breath, trying to forget the skin of her charge. She remember love; she remembers how it once felt to be held by a man, even if he was the wrong man. There is a civil war going on in her body. The brain, the cerebral side of this Confederate woman's mind knows that Corporal John McBurney(Colin Ferrell) can't be her lover, but it's too late. Martha wiped down the Yankee soldier's chest, measured her hand against his hand, and saw him naked, all the while this complete stranger, this unconscious man just laid there; drooled over, fantasized about, objectified. The cerebral north surrenders to the womanly south. The defeat gives her vertigo. Miss Martha, a patriot; iron-willed and sensible, knows better than to harbor an enemy. The boarding school girls are committing an act of treason. The headmistress should hand over John to the proper authorities. But alas, she saw his body at its most vulnerable state. The hairy chest is a game-changer.Sofia Coppola knows this. She gives agency to the so-called passive half of the sexes; the female gaze. Martha's transformation from mother figure to cougar in defrost is the pivotal moment in ""The Beguiled"". Her romantic mind turns John into eye candy. The soldier's semi-nude body gives this lonely woman pleasure. That's the point. It will justify, for some, the controversial decision to cut Hallie(Mae Mercer), the lone black character, a house slave, from the 1971 original. Don Siegel's adaptation of the Thomas P. Culinan nove, on the other hand, is unwavering. Hallie remains in the room while her master(Geraldine Page) strips the Yankee corporal(Clint Eastwood) down to his birthday suit. Coppola knew the potentiality of negative appraisal by critics from this loaded decision before filming ever started, but by creating intimacy between John and Martha, the filmmaker shifts the narrative/paradigmatic binary from white/black to man/woman. Labeled as, almost by consensus, an elitist who promotes ""a cinema of white privilege"" along with the usual suspects: Noah Baumbach, Wes Anderson, Whit Stillman, and Woody Allen, the lone female in the bunch, nevertheless, pushed on; forthcoming firestorm be damned, political correctness be damned, she thought. Coppola is blessed(or cursed) with tunnel vision. Hallie had to go. By excising the house slave, Coppola keeps the headmistress' secret confidential. Only Hallie would know about a painting that once filled the gilded wood frame, now empty, behind the corporal's bed. Hallie, regardless of color, was the woman who knew too much. Alone with her patient, Martha goes about dressing her patient's wounds, and the passionate thoughts that pervade her mind, the audience isn't privy to. Coppola drops the use of voice-overs. Kidman is spared such banalities, such as, ""If this war goes on much longer, I'll forget I ever was a woman."" Coppola preserves her dignity. The boarding school in the original ""Beguiled"" was a hothouse of horny women. Siegel, on the record, in production notes, compares this group of females to ""the mafia"". From his perspective, the victim is Corporal McBurney. After all, he apologizes for his bad behavior, and yet these vengeful harem of women have the gall to kill him. ""Women,"" he writes, ""are capable of deceit, larceny and murder"". He never mentions love, compassion, and magnanimity. Coppola sides with the girls. She turns John into the antagonist, discarding Siegel's notion of this Yankee deserter as an anti-hero. With one misogynist down, Coppola goes after another. She has bigger fish to fry; she goes after the great whale, so to speak. Coppola harpoons Alfred Hitchcock. When Miss Martha(Kidman) takes a good long look at the corporal's bared chest, Coppola provides the missing scene from ""Vertigo"". Through the mediating of the headmistress' implied lascivious gaze, the audience, for the first time, can picture Scottie Ferguson(Jimmy Stewart), a retired police officer, staring at every inch of Madeline's body from head to toe. He saw everything.Did Sofia Coppola remake ""Vertigo"", too? Did she read feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey, author of ""Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema""? Yes. ""The Beguiled"" is not concerned with historiocity. For some, the utilization of oppositional gaze semiotics is an end that justifies the means. Sofia knows scopophilia. Sofia knows phallocentrism. Hallie, arguably, could have waited outside with the other women and girls.The criticism is warranted. But Coppola knew that sprucing up Corporal McBurney was a house slave's job. She needed intimacy; man and woman, alone. So Hallie, fair or not, was jettisoned. When the opprobrium from Coppola's alleged ""race issues"" dies down, maybe her harshest critics will see with x-ray eyes the wheels that were turning in this uncompromising filmmaker's mind. In the 1958 classic thriller, Scottie Ferguson, a short-lived private detective, grieving, still, over Madeline's fall from the mission bell tower, sees a ghost, a woman who is the splitting image of his lost love; a chance encounter, a miracle, like a female Lazarus rising, a balm for his tear-stained eyes, from one of many fruitless and fatalistic searches through the city. Consumed by romantic obsession and a god complex, the self-styled Jesus changes Judy's hair color, goes wool suit shopping, and for a finishing touch, a French twist at the back of her head. Transgressions aside, despite the ruse that Judy and her shipbuilding magnate husband plays on Scottie, she does not deserve to be treated like a malleable love doll. But he is a haunted and sick man. And Martha, unbeknownst to a contemporary audience watching the remake in a vacuum, also has a deviation, even worse than Scottie's kinks. Coppola, however, keeps the taboo secret, because it's predicated, in her estimation, on a sick male fantasy. Acting on advice from an industry friend, Coppola screened ""The Beguiled"", and this is what piqued her interest, probably; the blanket that Edwina(Elizabeth Hartman) covers Burnham with is the same shade of red as the nightgown Madeline wears as she emerges from Scottie's boudoir. Sofia knows semiotics. Sofia knows revisionism. While the other girls talk excitedly about their unexpected visitor, Miss Martha enters the room with a white nightshirt, clothes that belonged to a dead lover, her brother. Martha doesn't have to be there.The wife of a cotton baron could care less about her slave being assaulted by some strange man. ""Go ahead, Miss Martha. He's not made no different than your brother,"" Hallie says, when her master balks at taking off the Yankee soldier's pants. Hallie continues: ""The nightshirt reminds me of Mr. Miles."" Coppola, then cuts to Corporal Burnham(Eastwood) lying on the bed, and a quick cut of Martha's brother positioned in the exact same way. Hallie expresses measured astonishment. ""Surprise it didn't you,"" she adds. She noticed. The resemblance is what got John safe passage into the schoolhouse. The nightshirt completes the transformation. Miles is alive.The original and the remake end the same. Death by mushrooms, a last supper served up by Martha Burnham, with one crucial difference. Geraldine Page plays a woman who feels no shame about her incestuous love affair. Her protestation over the corporal's discovery of he gun, and Miles' love letters is strictly a matter of privacy. The painting never comes down. Quentin Tarantino, in ""Django Unchained"", punishes the cotton plantation owners when Django(Jamie Foxx) guns down Monsieur Candy(Leonardo DiCaprio) and his sister, clearly modeled after the Burnham siblings. Unwittingly, Tarantino avenges Hallie, whom Miles abuses in the Siegel film, therefore absolving Coppola from her reviled casting decision, to a certain extent. Together, these disparate filmmakers eviscerate the misogynistic 1971 original, which depicts women as a coven of witches. ""The Beguiled"", under Sofia Coppola's direction, the painting, containing the likenesses of brother and sister, comes down. Martha knows what they did was wrong, and still she loved him. To the best of her knowledge, John finds the gun, but not the letters. How can she be sure, though? The headmistress doesn't want Edwina(Kirsten Dunst) and the other girls to find out. Just like Scottie, the reconstructed lover is a disappointment to Martha. What to do.Her vertigo returns.Amy is dispatched to find the bad mushrooms.",The Beguiled

104,JackCerf,Inferior To Siegel/Eastwood,5,3 July 2017,"Eastwood's Corporal McBurney was, as Edwina denounces him at the crisis of the story, a ""lying, filthy lecher."" He is a predator, and Siegel uses memory cuts to contrast with his lies and make sure we know it. But he's also a very macho man, who is convinced that he is in complete control right up to the moment when he is undone from a completely unexpected but perfectly foreshadowed direction.Coppola makes Farrell's McBurney a weak man. He has a fine line in Irish blarney, but he is above all a coward, and he is using his blarney to tell his female Confederate captors what he thinks will please them in order to keep himself safely out of the war.Siegel created hub and spoke relations between McBurney and each of the women, but he's uninterested in the relations between the women. Coppola is mainly interested in those relations and in McBurney only as he affects them. Siegel leaves it to the women individually to figure McBurney out; the only one who does is the slave housekeeper whom Coppola has photoshopped out of the story. Coppola has McBurney lose control and make himself an obvious danger to the group, who have to defend themselves as a group. That ruins the surprise of the ending. Siegel ambushes us doubly -- first, that McBurney is undone at all at the moment of his apparent triumph, and second, by who and what means. Coppola telegraphs it all.",The Beguiled
105,BoomerDT,Tepid Remake,3,16 July 2018,"Don Siegel's 1971 version was a taut gothic thriller, a tale of repressed sexuality as Clint Eastwood portrays a wounded Union soldier found behind enemy lines next to the property of girls boarding school. The presence of a virile man stirs the sexual hormones of the principals at the academy which included a middle-aged headmistress...whose sexual experience consisted of an incestuous affair with her brother, a 20ish virginal teacher, a slave, a sexy teenager and a 12 year old girl just hitting puberty. Clint's character quickly realizes how his sexuality is easily able to manipulate the women into what could be a very soft life while he is waiting to finish for the war to finish. Sophia Coppola's version has none of the sexual tension of the original with no real background or development of the characters. In the interest of PC the slave character is left out, as was the incest flashback. Colin Ferrell as the soldier isn't a fascinating presence as was Eastwood was and doesn't project the potential terror that Clint did.

106,Katz5,"Interesting, well-acted remake",6,16 April 2021,"An interesting remake that Sofia Coppola took on because she believed certain elements from the 1971 Clint Eastwood original could be retold from a woman's point of view (the original was mainly from Eastwood's POV). The film pretty much follows the original almost shot by shot, although filming it in Louisiana and setting it in Virginia made really no sense, since Virginia doesn't look much like Louisiana (why not just set the film in Louisiana, or another southern state with Spanish moss?) Nicole Kidman seems sleepwalking a bit - not one of her more memorable performances. Colin Farrell and Kirsten Dunst really make the movie. I am continually impressed by Dunst's talent and her ability to tackle a wide range of roles (instead of a nonstop stream of rom coms). The bonus material includes an interview with Farrell where he names this film as the most artistically beautiful film he's done. I guess he didn't get along with Terrence Malick (director of The New World?) If anything the film is too short and could have used some more character development.

She's the only one who oozes depth of characterisation among the lot. One of her looks, one gesture suggests more than all the others can manage all together.
Kidman conveys no authority as the school's ""authority"" and the various girls are just that, girls, including the sometimes promising Ellen Fanning.
Farrell is his usual graceless self, few actors have less charisma and screen presence than he has. He never manages to create sufficient menace to justify the end he meets at the women's hands. He's just a drunkard raving on. This is all sandpit level feminism.

I'm not saying I have to see nudity, gory violence, or detailed sex scenes, but the movie could have added so many more scenes to drive character development to make it interesting. There were far more opportunities for the woman to scheme and betray out of jealousy. The young seductress was not seductive enough. Just a curious young girl. Farrell's character also could have been more menacing. His portrayal made him appear to be an opportunist that did what he had to to stay out of war by charming lonely women. I wouldn't consider him to be evil or even pose a big threat to the women in the house. Even after his outburst, it could be understood after his leg was taken from him (with the exception of throwing the turtle). He was not evil to warrant the women's actions. He even attempted to apologize. Needed more interesting scenes to drive the story.",The Beguiled
111,makleen2,"A Pastel, Lifeless Remake",6,26 November 2017,"A wounded Union soldier is sheltered at a girls' boarding school in rural Virginia during the American Civil War, igniting pent-up passions and jealousy in this pale imitation of the 1971 Clint Eastwood classic, itself based on the 1966 Southern Gothic novel A Painted Devil by Thomas P. Cullinan. The Beguiled (2017), written and directed by Sofia Coppola, is a remake no one asked for, visually beautiful but emotionally monochrome.John McBurney (Colin Farrell) is a corporal in the 66th New York and wounded in the leg while fighting somewhere in Virginia in the summer of 1864. He stumbles through the wilderness and collapses. Amy (Oona Laurence), a young student at the nearby Miss Martha Farnsworth's Seminary for Young Ladies, discovers him and takes him back to the neglected school.Miss Martha (Nicole Kidman) stitches Corporal McBurney's wound and allows him to stay long enough to recover. Meanwhile, he attracts the attention of the other young ladies of the house, Alicia (Elle Fanning), Jane (Angourie Rice), Marie (Addison Riecke), Emily (Emma Howard), and especially their teacher, Edwina Morrow (Kirsten Dunst).McBurney is passive but emotionally manipulative. He pledges his love for Edwina, but after catching him in flagrante delicto with Alicia, she accidentally pushes him down the stairs, which opens his wound and breaks his leg. Miss Martha amputates his limb below the knee to prevent infection. McBurney flies into a rage when he sees what she has done, gratuitously injures Amy's pet turtle, and terrorizes the girls with a revolver.As McBurney and Edwina finally consummate their love, Marie suggests poisoning him with mushrooms. They invite him to dinner, feed him the poison mushrooms, and he dies. The girls wrap his body in a shroud and leave it outside the gates for passing soldiers to claim.The Beguiled is visually artistic, painted in soft tones using natural light and candlelight to illuminate a pallet of pastel creams, pinks, azures, and peaches. The sounds of nature and distant battle serenade every scene. There's a sense the school is besieged not only by an unseen force, but also by nature itself, run wild through several years of neglect.Sofia Coppola expressed a desire to retell this story from a female point of view, but I'm not sure how she accomplished this goal. She removed all action, tension, and controversy from the original film, leaving a pale, nearly emotionless shadow. She also omitted Hallie, a female slave, because ""Young girls watch my films and this was not the depiction of an African-American character I would want to show them."" Huh? She wrote the film - she could have depicted Hallie as the heroine if she wanted.The scene in which McBurney tumbles down the stairs is a perfect example of how this version falls short. In the 1973 film, Edwina attacks him in a rage and beats him with a candlestick, deliberately pushing him down the stairs. As McBurney falls, the audience watches from over Edwina's shoulder as the camera shakes violently. After, she continues to berate him and wishes he was dead. It's a jarring, emotionally charged and almost frightening scene.In this version, Edwina shoves him against the wall and he accidentally falls down the stairs. She shouts ""No!"" as he falls, emphasizing that it wasn't intentional. Then she just stands there quietly as Miss Martha rushes to his aid. The camera follows him down the stairs in a tight shot. In contrast to its predecessor, it's clearly shot in his perspective, which seems to undermine the director's vision for a female-centered film.Ultimately, The Beguiled has a great cast of experienced and up-and-coming actresses but no chemistry between them. A scene in which Alicia and Amy stand around lifelessly hitting the ground with hoes sums up the whole film. When Alicia asks, ""Are we almost done?"" she might as well be speaking for the audience.",The Beguiled

As they provide refuge and tend to his wounds, the house is taken over with sexual tension and dangerous rivalries, and taboos are broken in an unexpected turn of events.Overall The Beguiled is a good thriller drama film filled with team work, togetherness, some violence, shouting, disturbing scenes involving the injured soldier being treated which I will not go in to any detail about, nice scenery like trees in Virginia, Civil War Soldiers, dark scenes, some French language, teaching skills, chandeliers, a good insight in to the way of life in America during the American Civil War of the 1860's, musical instruments, dinner around the table, alcohol and other things throughout the film.So I will give The Beguiled an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars and The Beguiled is worth seeing if you like films set in the American Civil War era like The Birth Of A Nation, 12 Years A Slave, The Homesman, Little Women amongst others.So if you get the chance to see The Beguiled in the cinema then you should go and see it sooner than later but I should say that I have never seen The Beguiled film the original version from 1971 so I can't say whether the remake version of The Beguiled is better than the original version of The Beguiled from 1971 or not or whether The Beguiled from 1971 is better than The Beguiled remake from 2017 so I will have to watch The Beguiled from 1971 at some point and see how good that version is.",The Beguiled

I couldnt understand the character's motivations at times. It seemed like critical aspects were lost in the book-to-film translation (I haven't read the novel btw). I forced myself to watch the last 30 or so minutes. It was overall disappointing as it could have been something great. The cast is more than capable and the cinematography was beautiful but there's only so much that can be done with poor writing.,The Beguiled
120,thirtyfivestories,"Words Wound, Intentions Kill",8,22 September 2017,"A nation rupturing at its midsection. History would like to paint a tale of two opposing sides, but that is criminal oversimplification. An all girl's school rests just below the country's tear. A pocket of charm and tranquility in the midst blood-stained forests. A headmistress, Miss Martha, and her lone assistant, Edwina, have a meager five young ladies under their stern but gracious rule.The bubble of the school mansion ferments a Confederate sensibility among the girls, yet a fateful addition to the household shifts the popular perception. The precious Amy scavenges for edible mushrooms, a delicate task requiring obsessive attention to detail. At the base of a tree lays a cowering man in the enemy's colors. He is also wearing deep crimson, and the stench of fear. The southern girl waddles the soldier to the hospitable school in hostile territory.The coward is Corporal McBurney and he just might be the most fortunate soul in the whole war. The women of the house put the Good Samaritan to shame, and transverse foreign lands of medicine to save a man who is socioeconomically pitted against them. Then again, are they truly foes? Or has geography spoken for them?The Corporal remains a prisoner of war. Not a prisoner of the Confederacy, but one of psycho-sexual tension. And so are the women who now must protect him. Envy floods the curving stairways, and jealousy pollutes the well. The Corporal becomes a possession, and in turn he begins to objectify the women who secretly scuffle over him. Demand regulates a commodity's price, and the price tag for affection in the house reach lottery heights.​Miss Martha is a firm believer in healthy compromises, and for this she sacrifices her right to be justified. While Edwina strolls about with a gentle defiance, seemingly impervious to cardinal desires. The levity of the former, and the stonewall of the later create an massive, contained storm system. The low pressure of forgiveness collides with the high pressure of stern standards, resulting in a swirling catastrophe. Love is many things, but it is rarely kind. Genuine love is buried in the woods, inaccessible to those refusing to soil their clothing. Comfort is often mistaken as love. A warm bed mistaken as intimacy. The most dangerous game is not played with weapons; it is fought hand to hand with kisses and whispers.",The Beguiled
121,tom-456,"In most respects, the 1971 movie is better",5,1 July 2017,"I've always been fond of the 1971 movie starring Clint Eastwood and Geraldine Page. After watching this new version, a remake essentially, I am caused to think that Eastwood is a much better actor than what his reputation suggests. The remake certainly does have qualities that the original did not have, particularly the cinematography and the atmosphere. Unfortunately, however, there are a few curious flaws in the remake.Geraldine Page playing Martha in the original left the audience with no doubt that she was desperate to have a man in her life, and was so consumed by this desire that she was more than capable of doing serious evil. As such, when McBurney fell down the staircase and broke his leg, we were inclined to think that the leg didn't need to be amputated, and that she did it mainly out of spite. With Nicole Kidman's Martha, you don't really get this sense. I think that Nicole probably did a great job of acting as directed, but something was missing either in the directing or the editing. There is only one moment when we have any strong sense that she desires to have McBurney. It is when she washes him shortly after he arrives, right after she sews up the leg, while he is passed out. We do get a sense of lust here, but there isn't a single other moment when we get any strong sense that Kidman's Martha is desperate to have McBurney for herself.There are stark differences between Colin Farrell's McBurney vs. Eastwood's. Clint's McBurney was a scoundrel through and through. With Farrell's McBurney, we get barely a glimpse for a second or two that he is not the perfect gentleman that he seems. Eastwood's McBurney flirted heavily with each of the ladies, each time he was alone with any of them, and it certainly seems like those moments were more frequent in the original.Aside from Edwina and Amy, the names of the other young ladies are different in the two versions, however the character played by Elle Fanning corresponds to the character played by Jo Ann Harris in the original. Harris came across like a girl who liked to have her fun, and owing to the obvious mutual flirtation between her character and Eastwood's McBurney, we are not the least bit surprised when they end up in bed together. (If memory serves, in the original she sneaked into his room, whereas in the remake, McBurney climbs the stairs to access Fanning's character's room. I'm not altogether certain, but it isn't important.) In the remake, the Elle Fanning character comes across as a very virginal girl, likely a couple years younger than Fanning herself, and although she flirts with McBurney, it is completely innocent and naive. When they are discovered, it isn't quite believable.Young Amy, the mushroom gatherer who discovers McBurney in the first place, was similarly smitten by McBurney in the original. Amy had much in common with Martha in that both of them felt scorned and became evil witches when they both realized that McBurney had picked another. When the original Amy suggested that inedible mushrooms were the answer to their problem, you knew that she was behaving out of her impassioned anger at having her emotions toyed with. In the remake, this element of the story is simply not there.I had big hopes for this remake, and was looking forward to seeing whether Kidman could pull off a spiteful older woman, and to seeing whether Fanning could pull off a truly adult character. I think that Kidman could have pulled it off if she had been directed differently at just a few key moments. And I think that Fanning could have pulled it off, but was directed to play her part like a giggling school girl with a school girl crush on an older man, which would be okay except that then you end up with the disbelief problem when they are discovered together.I should mention that Farrell was much better at playing McBurney after the amputation. When he awoke to discover what had been done to him, you only hear him scream in horror. And then the anger, which seemed very real, whereas Eastwood's McBurney was angry in more or less the same way that all of Eastwood's characters are angry. There's no question that starting at that point, Farrell's McBurney is the better of the two McBurneys. But this pivotal point comes fairly late, and prior to reaching this point, you're never quite sure whether Farrell's McBurney is a gentleman or a scoundrel. With Eastwood's McBurney, it was apparent fairly early that he was a scoundrel through and through, and would probably have had all the ladies one after the other if he could have gotten away with it.The bottom line is that the remake isn't a bad movie, and is a pretty good movie in some important respects, however it does make a small number of significant blunders that were absent in the original.",The Beguiled
122,jchano123,"Super flat and boring, watch the original instead",3,11 December 2017,"What a boring, empty, lifeless movie. I can't fathom how so many people like this. All the characters in this were severely underdeveloped, unlike the original, and because of this the performances were extremely dull. If Farrell's character was supposed to be an American soldier from the north, why did he have an Irish accent? Could they actually not be bothered to find someone with an American accent or knew how to fake one? Also, why wasn't the slave in this? Southerners had slaves back then and that's a fact, so why try to sterilize it so much for what I can only guess is political correctness? Hattie was such a great character for so many reasons and her absence saddened me.The characters in the original were all bad people basically, but this portrays the women as being innocent and only wanting to do good as this man takes advantage of them which completely misses the point of the entire movie.Coppola decided to show literally everything in the worst possible way, completely ignoring the 'show, don't tell' rule of storytelling. The pivotal amputation scene that was easily the best scene in the original was completely skipped in this, causing an complete lack of tension.Additionally, the lighting was horrendous, causing even single scene to be so dimly lit that I was only able to know what was going on in some scenes since I finished the original 1971 version minutes before starting this.I honestly wasn't a huge fan of the original, but that was honestly miles better than this travesty.",The Beguiled
123,ReelLifeReviews,Who was asking for this?,4,30 June 2017,"The Beguiled (2017) - Not since Bambi have I seen so many twitterpated characters. But at least in that movie I actually cared about what happened to them.The trailers had me thinking there was going to be a Misery slant to the film, with Nicole Kidman playing a civil war version of Annie Wilkes, but that was completely misrepresented. It is a plodding story that lacks intrigue and and any realistic character motivations. You'd honestly think these women had never seen a man before with how taken they are by him. Since the basis of the story is this already-flimsy premise, it has no hope of building from there.The ensemble does a serviceable job with their performances, but they didn't get me interested in them individually. The size of the cast, while already relatively small, should have been pared down even further. Three of the students are all but interchangeable, so merging them into a single character would have allowed me to get more invested in the group overall.It really can't be overstated how much this movie spins its wheels. Over an hour is focused on waiting for a leg to heal and watching characters from age 8 to 48 throw themselves at the injured party. We are then served a thrown together final act that is void of reason.I had high hopes for this film, but ultimately came away disappointed. Farrell and Dunst, combined with the overall esthetic, brought the score higher than it would have been otherwise, but when you're that far down, really the only way to go is up. 4/10.",The Beguiled

I feel if there had been less long shots on trees and more time spent on building the characters this could have been a great film. As it was the characters were all one dimensional with very little time afforded to their back stories so I felt no connection to any of them. I gave this a 4 as the acting was okay and I can't come up with another reason other than I hate giving low scores.",The Beguiled
125,Deathstryke,"Beguilded, bothered and bewildered....",3,23 July 2017,"The trailer for ""The Beguiled"" tickled my interest, with its dark, menacing atmosphere and sumptuous colonial backdrop. It looked as though the premise of a wounded Yankee soldier being nursed back to health by some charitable Christian belles and their strict headmistress would undoubtedly lead to a snarled web of lust, deceit and paranoid female jealousy, with possible murderous consequences.To a degree, that is what happens, but without giving too much away, the film was a lot less menacing and tense than the trailer lead me to believe. This was ultimately the fault of Sofia Coppolla's meandering and pointless direction, which left the film feeling mostly flat, with few dramatic spikes. Another huge problem were some stultifying performances, most notably from Colin Farrell. In order for the central premise to work we are supposed to believe that the sudden appearance of Corporal MacBurney is so 'beguiling' to these lonely, scared women deprived of male company at a time of great threat and social upheaval, that he ignites a trail of envy and suspicion among the women vying for his attention. However, there is nothing really beguiling about Farrell's performance. He has no roguish charm or studly presence, not even when he's supposed to be seducing a blank-faced Kirsten Dunst with trite platitudes about her beauty...it all feels very shallow and unconvincing, devoid of chemistry and with dialogue so cliché I almost wasn't sure if he was joking. Even more annoying to me, as an Irish person, was that he delivers his lines in a contemporary, middle-class Dublin accent, which sounds both wrong for the time period and wrong for the social class of Irishman who would have taken up a mercenary position in the Civil War. Elle Fanning, who plays the sociopathic honey trap, Alicia, emotes like the villain in a high school play. She does nothing but roll her eyes and sashay listlessly about, which the Corporal seems to find irresistibly sexy for some reason. Kirsten Dunst is so reserved in her role as the plain, boring Edwina, that there are times when nothing happens behind her eyes. Indeed her character is meant to be unhappy and yearnful, thus easy to exploit, however this does not make for a compelling performance. There's nothing here for an actress of her caliber to really put her weight behind and she is largely forgettable.Nicole Kidman does better as the forthright Miss Martha. Her stoicism and acerbity hide a conflicted emotional state; her desire to keep the girls safe and be a patriotic Christian Vs her desire to sleep with the Corporal. There is something evidently off kilter about her, as if she could do something crazy at any moment, which makes her interesting.There are other, more bothersome moments of incredulity in the film. Characters behave in strange, irrational ways that often feel out of sync with preceding scenes, leading me to suspect that a lot of threads were lost in the editing process. Other scenes are so hammily acted they end up being unintentionally comical, like the scene where the women all sit around the dinner table giggling and swooning like simpletons to the bemusement of the Corporal. Or when a pet tortoise named Henry is thrown across the room in a furious rage (a few people laughed out loud at that bit).Perhaps the only beguiling thing about the film is the gorgeous cinematography, full of languid, dream-like shots of hazy sun sets, cascading willow trees and candle-lit dining rooms which are perhaps intended to lull the viewer into a false sense of security. What a shame that the performances and the dramatic heights could not match the level of the visuals. A better director would have made this work. Ultimately the film and its incongruous ending left me feeling cold, bored and bewildered.",The Beguiled
126,iamjacksmoviechannel,Why is nothing happening?,5,6 July 2017,"""The Beguiled"" is the new film from Sofia Coppola, daughter of a guy named Francis Ford, Oscar winner for ""Lost in Translation"".It takes place at an all-girls school in West Virginia during the the Civil War, chronicling what happens when a wounded Yankee soldier enters their midst. The answer to that- not much. This is Coppola's first thriller and to her credit, there is an eerie tone that she adds to this secluded, middle of the woods estate and to the sunlight/candle-lit interiors. She also again proves a big fan of the isolated character, one who feels relatively adrift while the rest of the world is just passing them by. Like ""The Virgin Suicides"", these women seem to live a pretty much idyllic life, i.e. their all bored out of their minds and can't wait for some male attention.These women include the headmistress, played by Nicole Kidman, a teacher played by Kirsten Dunst, and an older student played by Elle Fanning. The soldier is played by Colin Farrell. Coppola almost makes you think she's going for trashy titillation in the early going as these women play nurse and dress themselves up like a prize meant to be won. Just as a love triangle starts to develop, It's odd that it never really heats up. It's all just glances and brief kisses. If you've seen the trailer you probably know this gets darker, though not exactly better. After a really slow mid-section, the last act feels like nothing more than a male-is-evil diatribe.Just Farrell never comes off as that evil, but rather a charmer using anything he can to escape war-time horrors. But in their actions, the women also never seem all that wrong. Overall there is no real menace here, just actions perceived as such. No real sexual interest, just teases. No real characters, just winks and teases. That's the word for this movie- tease. If you liked this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more.",The Beguiled
127,wackywhovian11,War Is Hell,5,19 November 2017,"I gave a 5 out of 10 for The Beguiled I never saw the original with Clint Eastwood and I kinda wish I had because I love Clint so I guess I'll check that one out later. Anyway on with the review. Well the film takes place in 1864 3 years into the Civil War were a Union solider gets hurt and is found by a girl who is staying at the All Girls School in Virginia. The girls school helps the solider recover from his wounds and hey start to fall in love with this man who is flattered by this and starts an affair with two of the girls at the school causing an uproar between the ladies. That's basically the story in a nutshell I can't give too much away because that would ruin the movie. I watched this movie because I saw the trailer and I was curious to know what happened to the guy and what the ladies did to him and when I saw the film I was a bit disappointed in the outcome but still enjoyed it. I wish they had been a bit more creative in what the ladies did to Colin Farrell character. The reason I gave it a 5 because I didn't like the Virginian accent. The reason I say this is because I am from Virginia and an Oscar winner Nicola Kidman can't learn how to do an Virginia accent? At least Kristen Durst made an effect to try an Virginia accent. The little girl from Southpaw was really good in this film at least she took the time to learn how it would be to be a southern girl in the South during the Civil War. The film itself was a bit disappointing like I said because of what they did to the solider in the film. It's rated R for sexually but really theirs like two scenes and really nothing to get worked up about so it could have been PG-13. It was a bit boring in parts but still entertaining. Should you watch this film, well I rented it from Redbox for a $1.50 so really not that much of a bank buster in my wallet for not really liking it. I did like it but I think the trailer was misleading but still the acting was okay. Like I said these actors are professional actresses they can't do research on how to be a Southern lady? That's a bit insulting when you are from the state they are so called from. Is it worth the rental, well it depends on your liking of the period and the actors.

This was the worst lit film I have seen in recent history. It's as if Coppola was determined to imitate Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" and light her entire movie only with candle light.

It seems to me, though, that the original version starring Clint Eastwood as the Union soldier was a lot scarier. I may be wrong, but I believe they took both of his legs instead of only the hurt one, as with this version. The women were also a lot more sinister in the original. For whatever reason, the Coppolas felt that a newer version of the story should be filmed. I really don't see why, other than maybe for the excellent photography, and of course for Kidman's stellar performance, as always--even if she does perform the Roman Catholic Sign of the Cross backwards like an Orthodox Christian. I don't remember that the original version's women were Catholics, or that even Eastwood was presented as such, but a creepy aspect to this film is that everyone in the story is Catholic in the Deep South where Catholicism is and has always been looked down upon, yet the women take their revenge on the soldier despite them all sharing the same version of Christianity. All that said, if you haven't seen the first version yet, save it for last. This story is a nice addition to American Civil War Horror films, and much better than Dead Birds.",The Beguiled

Yet its 2nd in 1959 was universally praised.Here, Sofia Coppola, the daughter of FF, decided to take over the disturbing story ""The Beguiled"" that Don Siegel brought to the screen in 1971, with Clint Eastwood in unusual role for him and whose low key acting served him admirably.The version proposed by Coppola adds nothing to the original. The recreation of America's South in 1864 is no more convincing. The sexual tension, so palpable in the original, is almost absent in this version.This film has the merit however, to reveal to us a beautiful Nicole Kidman who becomes more and more a mature actress with much aplomb.

Simply put, get it over with and stop politicising art that should be free as long as it's art and not plain propaganda.

In normal conditions they all should have scored Oscar nominations for their subtle and expert performances. Even Elle Fanning is a nice addition to the trio of amazing thespians. As for Sofia Coppola, Hollywood likes to complain of the so-called lack of ""diversity"".

The slow camera movements, that kind of darkness. But they got repeated and overdone. I pulled away emotionally. There was just something cut and dried about this movie. It existed but it didn't live. Things passed. They were, for the most part, easy to take. Except the corporal's speed: in learning how to race with crutches so quickly, and a demise that lingered not at all. Kind of jarring to see such a lack of realism but they sure helped keep my eyes open.Not just cut and dried, but something overall superficial about this.

But this weekend I saw the new Sofia Coppola film ""The Beguiled"", which is based on the 1971 film of the same name starring Clint Eastwood and Geraldine Page. Before I go all IN on the film, here's a little tidbit about Coppola. She just won the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival in May, and is only the 2nd woman in Cannes history to win in that category. Let that sink in for a minute. Now getting back to this film. Out of the gate, the pacing was extremely slow. So much so, that I actually started looking for which exit I could get to the quickest. But I'm a trooper, so I hung in there.None of the characters were fleshed out, especially Kirsten Dunst and Nicole Kidman's caricatures of repressed southern belles. By the way, Kidman, Dunst, Elle Fanning and one other character in this meandering nonsensical film, kept losing their southern accents. I could have understood better if this were their first film (nervousness and all), but Kidman is an Oscar winner, Dunst and Fanning have over the years, gotten critical acclaim for their acting. They simply phoned in their performances and looked as if they couldn't have cared any less if they tried. Now let's get to Colin Farrell.His once promising career really hit an all-time low with this schlock. He hardly had any dialogue and the dialogue he had, was comical and it wasn't supposed to be. THAT'S how bad this film is. His best scenes were off-screen after Kidman's character amputated his leg and he found out. Why Coppola chose for the audience to hear his tirade instead of seeing it, was puzzling to say the least. That probably would have been great to see because Farrell is a good actor and he does a lot of his best work when he's in meltdown on-screen. Coppola's choices with how she shot this film left me and I'm sure so many others who've already seen it, wondering WHY? But here's one choice she made I'm in full support ofthe choice to NOT put the female slave character in this film that was in the book. The Black actress who would have been cast, dodged a bullet thank goodness. No one needs this incarnation of The Beguiled on their acting resume. The long and short of it is basicallyThe Beguiled didn't make any sense at all. It was a story without any substance or direction. How Coppola won in Cannes in the Best Director's category for THIS film is another mystery. To say The Beguiled wasn't her best work is an understatement, and it also begs to question the legitimacy of her winning that award.Coppola has done tons of applause worthy work such as Marie Antoinette, The Virgin Suicides and Lost in Translation, did the judges in Cannes see the same film as the rest of us? Did they get their eyes dilated that day and couldn't really see the banality of this film.what happened? As one critic noted about the film ""it was so unnecessary"" and no truer words could EVER be said about this film. This was a good idea gone horribly wrong and Coppola, the writers who helped her create this puerile piece of tripe and the actors, had no clue how to make this film compelling enough to where it would hold your attention and the audience would become emotionally invested. Instead, it had the audience holding their breath counting the minutes until the agony was over.",The Beguiled

141,treborquest,Misleading trailer,4,24 September 2017,"The trailer of this movie had me so excited. Some of my favorite actresses take part in this cast and the story, which I was unfamiliar with not having read the book or seen the '70's movie, and I usually love Sophia Coppola's films (well Marie Antoinette is one of my favorite films and she has done some marvelous work). But this, the movie does certainly not live up to the trailer. The acting is good, even though the dialogues remain weak and the characters do not get the chance to really evolve. The fact that there is no background music in this movie leaves the spherical build up to your own imagination, which becomes a weakness of the movie in the second act. When you think finally something is going to happen, it is so little and so disappointing that it becomes frustrating to watch. At the moment the end credits started, I just said 'is this it? When is the movie going to start?' but sadly enough, it had already finished. I gave it 4 stars, because Dunst and Kidman (stay away from the botox) have a good performance, but they just can't save the movie. And message to trailer makers, this movie got it's age rating because of the trailer and that trailer, even though it looked good, it belonged to a completely other movie.

143,FallonTimberlake2016,"Disappointing, despite being overall competently made.",5,18 October 2017,"The Beguiled is a historical thriller that stars Colin Farrell as a Union soldier who is found injured by a member of an all-girls school. He is taken into this school to recover, and ends up lusting for a couple of the girls that are there, causing jealousy and anger. This film had been getting buzz by a lot of critics, and I was intrigued by the plot, so I was looking forward to it. Honestly, The Beguiled was pretty disappointing to me. Yes, it was competently made, but it was seriously forgettable, and I left feeling like nothing really happened. I was hoping for this film to be really mentally challenging, with twists and turns and a message that made you think. I got none of those things. As soon as the plot really kicked in I knew exactly what was going to happen at the end. For the entire movie, I was waiting for the plot to take an unexpected turn, but it went in the exact route that I expected it to go. The acting was good all around with an all-star cast that includes Nicole Kidman, Colin Farrell, Kirsten Dunst and Elle Fanning. (Yes, Elle Fanning was actually not completely annoying for once.) The direction and cinematography were also fairly well put together, but nothing I haven't seen in other films.There are also some logical flaws near the end that really take you out of the movie. It seems like these flaws are included because the writer wanted to get to the end as fast as possible, and she didn't care how.The film ends incredibly abruptly, and I left realizing that I seldom felt a moment of tension throughout the entire film. With a plot like this, you would think this would be a tension-filled movie, but it ends up just being boring and anticlimactic.If The Beguiled had a profound message or anything to make me feel like i watched it for a reason, then I may have enjoyed it more. However, it falls short on all storytelling aspects, so you are left just looking at the good acting and cinematography while waiting for something interesting to happen.

She managed to create yet another melancholic and dream-like film and put her personal stamp on it. Acting-wise, it was sufficient; I felt everyone played their role just fine, and I thought it was a well-selected cast. However, I don't think the script allowed the actors to showcase their range, except for maybe Colin Farrell. I didn't know it was a remake. I wish I had seen the original first, but as an isolated film, it was decent...although lacking a little depth. I wanted more expansion on the characters and their motivations, and while the ending was good, it was predictable. I was hoping for more impact in terms of the intangible, but visually the last frame did give me chills. Overall, I wouldn't mind watching it again, and I adore Coppola's cinematography, but the film itself is missing a little something extra to make it the complete package.",The Beguiled

Could it be because he literally shouts ""what have you done to me you vengeful bitches!"" This is the second movie this year I've seen with a misleading trailer. The first being It comes at night which was a very poor title because literally nothing came at night but nighttime. This movie too has an exceptional cast with a storyline that falls flat as a pancake. Here goes the summary: guy shows up wounded, women take him in until he heals, girls are all smitten, guy fools around with girl, girl he told he loves catches them and pushes him down stairs, guy breaks leg so they amputate it, guy wakes up and gets angry, women can't live with angry man, women poison him with bad mushrooms. The end. This was boring from start to finish so much so no music at all plays during the film so every scene feels dull and lifeless. I love how people say slow burn.

The beguiled seems to me a good underrated film which could provide a very satisfying aesthetic experience. An atypical and dense, but brief drama. Mature and well structured. Generous in expressive resources. Beautiful. The film proposes a very particular atmosphere with ambiguous characters and its balance between formal delicacy and cold blood. It is a choral movie and the performance of the entire cast is quite sober and remarkable for their complicity. The soundtrack enriches the feeling of suffocation in a very effective way. The artistic part is really stand out and deserves awards or recognitions at least: the costume design and the cinematography are impeccable.

147,listofnames,Just be a nun instead and live will run more smoothly for everyone.,8,16 July 2017,"Set in mid 1800s in civil war torn Virginia. A bunch of young women of various ages headed by Nicole Kidman's seminary mistress wait out the war in a large grand old plantation house. Taken at face value this film is about a wounded soldier (Colin Farrell) disrupting their perfectly cultivated peaceful (and stifling) civility. The women and girls all take a fascinated interest overtly/covertly and sexual/nonsexual in the newcomer. This leads to a sometimes amusing, sometimes cringe-worthy, ultimately disastrous competition for his attention. As with all Sophia Coppella films (so I'm told, having only seen Lost in Translation) this is a beautifully shot. There is a real sense of being out in the middle of nowhere surrounded by hauntingly twisted swampy trees and swirling mists. The period outfits and decor are painstakingly realised. The individual characters of the female cast are all very individual and well cast. The acting is of course pretty good all round but no stand out performances. Colin Farrell is basically just Colin Farrell doing his own accent (interestingly he plays an Dubliner (albeit from a different era) so not much of a stretch). On one level this film could be a cautionary tale about the destructiveness of sexual desire. Both women and man all undignify themselves in some way for the sake of romantic or sexual attention. But short term gain leads to long term pain. Or is it perhaps making a statement about how we are never satisfied no matter what we have. A friend who saw the film with me seemed to think the film was about change. The house was a microcosm of the oncoming changes of the Civil war. The women wanted things to remain how they were but the soldier represented the coming change of the end of the war. They couldn't live with the change though and remained yearning for things to be as they were. The ending of the film is only a temporary reprieve.",The Beguiled

149,demented_peruvian,Dull storytelling for the sake of imagery,5,3 December 2017,"Sofia Coppola seems to have set out to do the opposite of her trademark first few movies, which were colorful, well paced, and found something cheerful amid sadness. Here she works with a slow pace, morose tone, unsaturated and dark cinematography, and weak storytelling, to no reward whatsoever. Yes, she assembles many interesting Southern Gothic images that look straight out of painting, but then overdoes it, with repetitive imagery. I understand it to be symobolic, as there is a brief break from this, into more light and colors, for about 5 minutes, when the characters explore romantic/sexual feelings, before returning to the same. But I've seen haunted house movies with more color. My eyes were literally craving color and light after watching this.Not helping: the sound mixing was not that great, the accents were unstable, the soundtrack was not existent (save for a few pounding deep notes in one or two suspenseful sequences in the otherwise lifeless third act), there were too many lingering shots that seemed to be padding time, and when the plot swings into full gear, it is brief, has a couple of tense scenes, and then limps along to its conclusion.

I can appreciate Sofia Coppola's intention to not recreate a carbon copy of the original, in which Eastwood was clearly a malevolent, manipulative, degenerate up against an equally perverse woman, which leads to his downfall. Here, both protagonists seem rather nice, pleasant and helpful, which makes for a rather boring 3 quarters of the movie where there is absolutely no tension whatsoever.
It's only in the last 15 mins when things get rushed at a comical pace do we see any cause for the final arc of the movie. Colin goes from being Mr Nice and Honest Guy to Sad Victim, to Slightly Unhinged Victim to Violent Monster, to Sexually Frustrated Rapist, and back to Mr Pleasant and willing potential Husband for Edwina. This arc was not believable at all, as there was no dark undertones which would suggest such a turbulent change in demeanour, whereas this was definitely played out in the original.
It's like Coppola knows nothing about subtext to make characters believable, relying instead on a heavily watered down script and some shots of trees. It's not enough.

Also, in the 1971 movie I finally understood why he went to the ""wrong"" bed. In this version, that is a meaningless thing to do.There are more issues that other reviewers have pointed out, but the general feeling I have now is that thew new version is sterile in many ways, and that didn't need to be the case.It's still worth seeing but it does appear like a textbook example of ""why the original was better"".",The Beguiled

The only problem I had with the actors is I thought Nicole Kidman looked too young to play Miss Martha. She looked a little older than the students! This movie never showed that Miss Martha was a deviant (her own brother?!) like the first movie did. I also thought it was a dirty shame not to have the Black woman in this one. She brought a certain dimension to the first film. McBurney was a charmer and seducer in the first movie, but lacked all of that in this one.

The film is missing all the oomph that the original with Clint Eastwood directed by Don Siegel had in 1971 – that was a damn good movie, hands down.I first became acquainted with Sofia Coppola in Godfather part III, the movie that destroyed the legacy of Godfather and Godfather part II (but let's not get in to that particular problem in this review, but let me just say this: if you loved how part II ended in strong melancholy, you should never, ever watch part III – Nor should you watch the *REDUX* re-edited version of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece Apocalypse Now).Sofia was fairly good as an actress, but in the end scene at the opera where she got shot, she lost it. That was horrible acting and she did not convince me that her character actually died That by its own destroyed the ending of Godfather part IIISo when she years later decided to become a film director I thought to myself that maybe that was a vice decision of her. And I think it was. She has made some decent good films, but not this one. The new version of The Beguiled becomes more of a stylistic experiment in southern foggy weather, periodic dresses and beautiful misty mornings.The film is also an experiment in how to make a good story boring. Enough said. Almost.With the understanding that I might be called a male chauvinist pig, it is my honest opinion that this types of movies and The Beguiled in particular, should be, and was, made by a man.

Sofia Coppola highlights the ways of behavior and reaction of 5 young girls and 2 women before the unexpected encounter with a wounded enemy soldier and who in a joint decision they decide to shelter and heal at their school.
With a Philippe Le Sourd cinematography, Sofia generates an adequate atmosphere and demonstrates her touch as a filmmaker, capturing within an apparent environment of cordiality and refinement with prayer, music and singing, as opposite attitudes also arise that will alter this 'beautiful' ambience.
Thus, the principal, teacher and students modify their attire, they want to please, flirt and seduce, behaviors that necessarily lead to games of competition, jealousy and eventually treason. Until now the corporal has been a game for them, now the corporal also plans to participate in it ...
The director now generates a climate of greater closeness, warmth and intimacy, to arrive with a good dose of suspense to the climax and end of the film, where harmony has been interrupted, desire has ignited, there are consequences and a plan will have to be found, to regain stability.
As in the beginning, everyone will participate in the planning and execution, forgetting, friction and feelings ...
Sofia Coppola won the 'Palme d'Or' for best director with this film, for her interesting approach that allows you to discern who is the seducer and who is the seduced.

I had been told that this wasn't a strict remake of the original film so that piqued my interest. Unfortunately, that is not true. It is basically just a remake. Obviously, Sofia Coppola's take is going to be different from Don Siegel's, but it is essentially the same film. I applaud her ambition in remaking a film made by one of the greatest directors who ever lived (a man who oftentimes worked with low budgets on films with little expectations, but usually managed to deliver with a finished project way above what he had been given to work with). But sometimes it doesn't make sense to try to replicate something already done by a master (Invasion of the Body Snatchers was changed enough to avoid that trap). Siegel's version was a great film and this version doesn't stand up to it. The tension (sexual and otherwise) present in the Siegel film really isn't here in this film. Other than between Kirsten Dunst and Colin Farrell there really doesn't appear to be the sexual attraction that existed between multiple characters in the original. The acting is good (Farrell is terrific in particular), but the sexual tension that should be there between Farrell's character and Kidman's and Fanning's just isn't there. I enjoyed the film and probably if I hadn't seen the original I would have enjoyed it more. The scenery is pretty bleak (not at all like Virginia where it's supposed to be set, I kept on thinking did they mean to have this set in Louisiana) and the score didn't really add much (unlike in the original with a score by Lalo Schifrin who Siegel frequently used). So my advice is to skip this version except to see a really terrific performance by Colin Farrell, and watch the original instead.",The Beguiled

Best film Sofia Coppola has made in a long time. Everything from the costume choices to the dull scenery make sense.

I do know that this version is much more focused on the women's point of view, which is interesting that it's supposed to be the other way around.The film look very beautiful, despite it being shot in very dark lighting which may actually add to the tone of the film. I'm slightly conflicted on the length and passing of the film, however. While on one hand i would have liked the characters to have developed a little bit more before that final act, at the same time it could have run the risk of becoming more boring, especially when the film is already very patient and slow, despite being a some what short film. And it can feel a bit repetitive at times (i swear they use the shot of the girl looking over the school from afar like 10 times).But besides that, the acting is great from everybody. Hell, even the kids do a great job in it. The silence and ambient sounds makes it easier to get sucked into the story, and even the rare moments where the actual score comes in it is welcome and adds to the experience. And all of the characters are great to watch, even if some of them aren't as memorable or focused on.The last part of this film (where sh¡t hits the fan, basically) is the strongest, as great tension and fear is created between the women and the soldier until the story bookends nicely, with the film starting with picking up mushrooms leading to salvation, and ending with the same task leading to death.

But I'm sorry to say that this remake of The Beguiled 2017 lacked substance and passion. Well, you can't win them all!The entire cast is very talented in their own right. I've seen most of these actors in other great films. One of my all time favorites is Colin Farrell. I was hoping for that same fire and strength that he exuded in many of his other great films. It just wasn't there or perhaps I couldn't see it through the very dim lighting. Sorry to say, this remake doesn't even compare to the 1971 film with Clint Eastwood. The lighting was so poor that I couldn't even see the expressions on each of their faces to determine whether their performances were good or bad. I see what Ms. Coppola was going for in this dated piece--natural lighting, candlelight and such, but that poor lighting was practically throughout the whole movie. At first I thought there was a problem with my SmartTV. But I stuck it out until the end. The characters, though isolated and backward, longed for excitement; longed for change; longed for love! Enter John McBurney. I could sense their loneliness and boredom, but there was no passion or even joy, for that matter! As for the so-called sexual tension--what sexual tension?

163,choonmixer95,Very very disappointing,2,23 July 2017,"I was expecting a great deal from this movie as I had enjoyed the original Don Siegel movie of 1971. Having watched this very weak remake I went back and watched the original again. I'm glad I did.The original 1971 movie is an interesting claustrophobic Gothic thriller set against the backdrop of the brutally divisive American Civil War. The original movie initially juxtaposes the caring females who rescue the dying soldier and nurse him back to health (despite him being the enemy), against the typically male scheming, conniving (and ultimately violent) persona of the soldier who sets about seducing his way to domination. The movie then subverts the narrative with the manipulative behaviour of the jealous women and their ultimate act of revenge brought about by his own arrogant assumptions of male superiority. Hardly any of this is present in this remake. Furthermore, the sexual tensions of the original movie with its disturbing take on incest, predatory underage sex and the destructive jealousy between the principal and the unmarried teacher which eventually leads to the wounded soldier's demise was almost completely absent from the Coppola movie. In addition, the new movie also removed the black slave character and in so doing a whole subtext concerning white male exploitation of black women and overall black subjugation by both the Confederate and Union armies was lost. The Coppola movie never really gets going and the removal of all of the backstories left the viewer with no idea of why the characters were behaving in the way they did. As many other reviewers here have said it makes for a boring turgid evening. Mercifully it was only 90 minutes long.Viewed through modern eyes,the the 1971 film is a bit clunky but the Coppola movie is so thin by comparison.

166,gailspilsbury,Atmosphere permeates this high-class horror movie,8,26 July 2017,"Quite a lot spellbinds in Coppola's Beguiled, the word itself having multiple meanings for the film. Like Terence Davies' A Quiet Passion about Emily Dickinson, Coppola's work studies human character and psychology, employing a textured, historic setting, full of detail—a female world, cloistered and gated. Although the time is the third year of the Civil War and the location a plantation house built with the traditional front columns of the ruling class, the war is not the story. Instead, it provides a framework for why the finishing school that now occupies the mansion has only five girls remaining. Miss Martha Farnsworth (Nicole Kidman), daughter of the former plantation owner, runs Miss Farnsworth's Seminary for Young Ladies, with the help of an assistant, Miss Edwina (Kirsten Dunst). Each of the five girls still at the school has a character role in the film, most notably Miss Alicia (Elle Fanning), a sexually hot teenager with a contemptuous personality, and Miss Amy (Oona Laurence), an eleven-year-old scholarly type with long, straight braids. All of the other women, except for their leader Miss Martha, wear elaborately braided hair and dress impeccably, their exquisite gowns sewed, laundered, and pressed at one time by slaves, who have since fled the Virginia homestead. Dress, manners, comportment are one of the ""character studies"" in the film—upper-class Southern women during the slave era. They curtsy when they greet someone, they speak with cultured articulation, and they learn the skills for their future as privileged women and wives: quiet handiwork, a smattering of French, music, and elegant dining-room etiquette. We see how they're raised toward a perfection in femininity, like goddesses; their ladylike achievement is already established in childhood, but it also confines them, stifles them.The next study, and related to the girls' polite veneer, is their natural sexual drive for a man. And when a handsome man arrives to their cloistered world, all of them—from Martha with her aging face to the youngest girl—seek approbation from the lone man under their roof, Union soldier, Cpl. John McBurney (Colin Farrell), an Irish mercenary. He is the enemy, but being good Samaritans the women must treat his badly wounded leg and let him convalesce before turning him over to the Confederates. We see by their magnetism to him that they also make excuses for keeping him longer. Their innate female biology drives them to dress up for him, flirt, charm, and allure him. The three eldest vie to sleep with him.The next study Coppola offers us is Cpl. McBurney and how from the start he warmly personalizes each interaction with the women so that they won't turn him over to the Confederates. He's a talented manipulator with his gentle, solicitous Irish brogue, but wouldn't his behavior be the same for any of us caught inside an enemy camp? This enemy camp happens to be all-female with femininity at its most cultivated state, so his wiles work in that direction. And he easily succeeds because other forces are helping him, namely the women's natural pursuit of a desirable man. The tingling of this male-female dynamic permeates each scene like erotic vapors. Here the title looms most, for the word beguile has several meanings: to charm, enchant, sometimes in a deceptive way, to seduce, to trick, and, in older usage, to help pass the time pleasantly. Beyond these meanings in the film, the movie's otherworldly, strangely ghostly aura—the eerie forest of Hansel and Gretel—beguiles the audience. Credit for this atmosphere goes to Coppola's sense of texture and Philippe Le Sourd's cinematography.The strongest character in the movie is Miss Edwina, whose sad, detached face and resignation to her female lot convey a real person, whereas the other women in the story play their roles. Cpl. McBurney, though also a role, has a real moment when he loses his wounded leg. His violent reaction, his anguish and thrashing madness at the women's treachery, show us a true reaction to a horrific occurrence. Like the women imprisoned by their chauvinistic society, McBurney is agonizingly trapped in his ruined life.A brilliant twist occurs at the end of the second act and transforms the quiet sobriety and simmering sexuality of the movie into a gruesome realm, already set-up by the story's ethereal, fairy-book atmosphere. Horror seamlessly creeps in, and the change in the girls' personalities from angels to witches is a wonderful stroke. Our gracious Southern hostesses seated around the formal dining table in their beautifully crafted dresses and discreet jewelry, behave demurely as they serve Cpl. McBurney poisonous mushrooms. Miss Martha's gleaming eye and gloating smile as she meets her enemy's eye when his choking death throes begin, couldn't be more sinister. Her formerly aging, pretty face is now pinched and wicked, like Dracula, the mouth suggesting a drip of blood.We leave the theater full of thoughts, always the sign of a good movie. The study of women's nature when their sexuality kindles raises questions: What if McBurney had been a Confederate soldier instead of a Yankee? Would the women have revenged so cruelly his deceptions with them? Was amputation really necessary or the result of Miss Martha's wounded vanity? The creepy mood of the last act suggests the latter; attraction had turned to enmity, with shocking consequences. More questions arise: What happens when several women vie for the same man? Disaster, evil. Why was Cpl. McBurney so dumb as to sneak into one of the women's rooms wearing shoes and tapping his cane, so that everyone else in the house could hear his movements, bringing on the crisis? How ironic that this Irishman made his way to the New World for a better life and because of dire need joined the Union Army only to have his life destroyed. And finally, what genre is this movie—highbrow horror along the lines of Robert Eggers's The Witch, with its subtitle A New England Folktale? Whatever its classification, an artist has made it and with a beguiling aesthetic.",The Beguiled

168,John-564-342449,"Don Siegel's version is much better, but this one is visually more beautiful",6,9 July 2017,"I saw Don Siegel's version many years ago on TV and thought it was great: A surprising, slightly subversive tale of a macho killed by sexually repressed women. I knew nothing about the story before and expected a Clint Eastwood western, but it was something else, something much better: It's like a Southern Gothic Tale told by Ingmar Bergman. It has similarities to Bergman's masterpiece ""Cries and Whispers"" (1972) - the closed setting in a house and many women in psycho-sexual conflicts - but ""The Beguiled"" (1971) was written and shot earlier than Bergman's popular art house hit. Don Siegel's film is simply a timeless chamber piece about the war of the sexes in a highly symbolic war setting. It offers strong drama, nasty fun and uncommon psychological realism.I was curious to see Sofia Coppola's version, because of the so-called 'feminine touch': Would it really make a huge difference to the material if a woman was the screenwriter and director? In what way? Would it result in a more realistic portrait of the women? Better female psychology? A better film?I saw the movie today with the expectation that the answer would be ""Yes!"", but to my surprise, this was not the case. As a piece of dramatic storytelling it doesn't work as good as Don Siegel's version, which made more out of the dramatic scenes at the end. In Coppola's version we never quite understand the psychology of the women as well and sometimes it even appears like whole scenes are missing, because the women suddenly do things that are not clearly motivated.Like getting shagged by Colin Farrell on the floor after he threatened to shoot them. If a male director would have made that scene, people would cry: ""Such a cheap male fantasy! Women don't get aroused by violent men!"" But when Sofia Coppola does this kind of far-fetched scene, it seems to be O.K.? For me, it didn't work. Some people laughed, because it appeared ridiculous in the context.It might not be a popular thing to write, but in my opinion, the artist who understood women better and showed them in a more plausible way, was Don Siegel - yes, the director of ""Dirty Harry"" - not the ultra-sensitive Antonioni-esque Sofia Coppola, who is mostly concerned with visual design anyway, not story, psychology and character.But what visual design! Every shot is exquisite and some scenes are crafted to perfection. Cinematographer Philippe Le Sourd deserves at least an Academy Award nomination for his work. The sound design and minimalist score are very effective, too. All of this is the result of careful direction - no doubt - but Sofia Coppola doesn't succeed where Don Siegel had his strongest points: The characters and the storytelling. So, is this the 'feminine touch' ? I doubt it has much to do with gender.The distributor and some reviewers will try to sell you this movie as the 'feminist version', but it isn't. It's the same story, but not told as well and with less insight into the women. But don't dare to say it too loud - the feminists will get angry at you, because their cliché ideas of the superiority of 'the feminine touch' ain't true. Another problem of this version is that Sofia Coppola erased the slave woman character, who had a purpose and function in the original story. Even if she was only a supporting character, it reminded the viewer of the past slavery and other forms of inequality beyond gender: Racism, class and access to education. It made the story richer and added to the theme of unequal power struggles within society. It's a poorer screenplay without her and it smells of historical revisionism and artistic cowardice not to deal with a subject like slavery in this kind of historical setting. The 'Good Old South' was not only a horror to rich white women, right?All in all, it's still worth seeing, at least for the great visuals, good actors and some fine moments.In my opinion it's only a 6 out of 10, while Don Siegel's minor classic is at least a 9/10.",The Beguiled
169,BigSoulDiva,Sofia's deeply felt chamber piece,10,3 July 2017,"I see this film as an addendum to Sofia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides. It contains the same themes and emotional content. Coppola is endlessly intrigued by the way the patriarchal system house women in contained areas. This micro universe, a southern female boarding academy, makes for an intriguing world for Coppola to unpack her bag in. I'm not entirely confident this is the best scenario for the director to best elucidate her audiences's emotions, but it is an intriguing choice. And a beautiful one at that. The film was shot on 35mm and looks breathtaking on screen. The terminally under-lit plantation house makes tremendous use of negative space. Coppola resists exploitation by consistently pulling away from the crisis to check in on the students. They move like a hive through the house eavesdropping on the adults. We feel like them; disoriented, unable to fully comprehend what is going on. This film is so worth seeing because it is told completely from a female point of view.

Hard to decide. Actors seem to move around as subjects in a tableau of stylized Victorian portraits, their roles seem interchangeable. Handsome Colin Farrell hardly seemed worth the group effort. Nothing emotionally charged, not much going on at Miss Martha's School except a bit of sewing, foraging for mushrooms, French verbs, dressing for dinner, more sewing.

This new Sophia Coppola version is stripped down and streamlined , which leaves crucial character development and backstory lacking, while somehow also seeming more drawn out and boring than the original that had a longer run time. Even the picture quality and cinematography were better in the original,..yes,a movie that is over 45 years old even LOOKS better than one filmed in 2017. There were crucial flashbacks in the original that paint the ""McBurney"" character as less sympathetic and more of a lying scoundrel. The sexual tension and love/lust triangle was much better fleshed out in the original ,with dream sequences showing that Martha the head mistress had bisexual cravings and simultaneously, secretly lusted after Edwina and McBurney while also being jealous of them. The little sexpot character of Carol (Alicia in the 2017 version) was much better and more believable in the original. The Edwina character was PERFECTLY cast in the original by the believably innocent naive Elizabeth Hartmann, a hauntingly tragic figure who took her own life in real life after struggling with depression and bisexual urges before it was socially acceptable. ...And perhaps one of my biggest qualms with the new version is that they COMPLETELY TELEGRAPH the twist ending and remove all of the shock value by basically telling you point blank what they are going to do. The 1971 version was an incredible piece of art, well ahead of it's time, perhaps too much so for 1971 tastes. It was better cast, better filmed, better directed ,better explained and better ended. The new version is getting what are in my opinion over-hyped accolades due to this whole "" womens' empowerment"" social meme nonsense, but as a piece of art it is merely ""servicable at best"".

I find that the new version was completely spoiled by PC fanaticism. I don't understand why Sofia Coppola left out Hallie the slave, slavery was a key point on the American Civil war and Hallie was an important character with lots of interesting dialogues. She also left out the scenes of the crush between the soldier and Amy, the 12 years old girl in order to not shock people with paedophilia. The incestuous memories of Martha were also left out. In summary, she impoverished the characters, their relationships and their thoughts to avoid shocking PC people and replaced the interesting varied characters by a group of pretty blondes.

I'm rather disappointed that Hallie was cut from the film and even more with Sofia Coppola explanation that ""she felt slavery was such an important topic and she didn't want to treat it lightly."" It was taken lightly and seen as trivial, that is what should really horrify us, it was insidious and that was the problem.

Unfortunately, this remake of the film gives us very little in the way of conflict or tension after the setup and introduction of the characters.There is some decent acting here from the cast, but I found it nearly impossible to see any detail in their faces due to the choice of shooting in very low light or artificially creating the effect in post. While I can't place blame entirely on the film as our local theater may have had issues with their projection system. Still, I prefer to see the expressions in actor's faces, otherwise I might as well be listening to a radio play.The film could have been a full stop brighter and adding some fill light on the faces still would have allowed the look to be dark and drab as it was apparently intended.By the time we get to the third act we still aren't rooting for our protagonist and frankly it's not completely clear until the climax that it's supposed to be Kidman's character.

188,funkyjuju,Enjoyable but silly,7,31 July 2017,"First of all, I have heard many people talking about how much they admire this ""female empowered"" version of the story. To be fair, I have not seen the 1971 film nor read the book but I did not find this film to be particularly feminist. A film does not have to be feminist to be considered worthwhile but there were several characters (Alisha - the slutty one, Jane - the clever one, Marie - the religious one) who were barely fleshed out compared to characters such as Martha and Edwina who I managed to get a real feel for. As it is, 'The Beguiled' is fairly short so I think the director could have spent more time adding depth to the other characters. It's not fair to praise this film for its feminism just because it has a mainly female cast/female director.The character of Alisha was especially shafted as she was completely villainised for simply having sexual desire. I kept waiting for the point where the audience would be made to sympathise with her and it would be a comment on the oppression of female sexuality in that time period but the film ends with her character just as shallow as she was at the beginning.However, Alisha is played with delicacy by Elle Fanning who was wonderful to watch. In fact, all the characters were played to perfection. Kirsten Dunst masters Edwina's sad kindness, Nicole Kidman is a joy to watch as the stern Martha Farnsworth, and Colin Farrell does a fantastic job walking the line between sly manipulator and manipulated victim.The real fault of this film is its silliness. Southern Gothic is high drama which makes it difficult to play straight and in general Sofia Coppola does a good job at setting this tense, dark tone but there were more than a few moments where the whole audience were giggling at scenes I'm pretty sure were supposed to be serious.There were also narrative problems. For example, at first I believed John was seducing Edwina just to keep her on his side. I thought it was all just manipulation. But then towards the end of the film they have this passionate sex scene and Edwina is the only one not trusted in the plot to kill him, which would suggest that they genuinely love each other. Then why did John go to Alisha's room? Because it was more likely he'd get his leg over? That doesn't sound like the actions of a man in love. All in all, despite the many hilarious flaws of this film, 'The Beguiled' is very enjoyable and I would definitely see it again. Its flaws are interesting and that makes it fun to discuss so I've given it a 7/10 and I would recommend it to others although I would not expect it to win many awards.",The Beguiled

The simmering jealousy and dare I say, catty remarks, of the women to each other while vying for his attention was excellent as they were all far too ladylike to do it in an obvious way.

196,AmorLucis,Coppola's Post-Gender Masterpiece,10,22 July 2017,"It would be easy to view this film as all about gender. (Is it feminist? Is it anti-feminist?) Or even to focus on race issues. (Did Coppola whitewash the story?) But that misses the point of this sumptuous, visceral, superlative movie. Coppola made a film about what humans do under extreme conditions that is refreshingly devoid of the gender tropes Hollywood loves to spew such as ""lusting male manipulator"" and ""frigid female spinster."" In this film, every character is first and foremost human--complex, nuanced and struggling with their conflict between survival, desire and morality. Coppola's film shows that humans (male and female) struggle with the same conflicts. Yes, women lust. And, yes, men have moral struggles. Because both women and men lust and have moral struggles. And both have the instinct to survive. The experience of the film was a unique blend of powerful sensuality--the intimate sharing of music, food, and prayer, acts of care and service like bathing, bandaging and even gardening, exotic rich nature scenes, the distant sounds of war and the sparse but compelling soundtrack make this a film you want to crawl into and touch, taste, and smell as well as see and hear. The exquisite costuming creates mesmerizing tableaux as well as expresses both what's common and unique to each of the female characters--not an easy feat to accomplish. The leading stars shine brilliantly, but we also see a depth and profundity of character and acting among the 4 young girls in the film. A truly ensemble drama, not usually seen among a cast of such varied ages.The emotional ride is also a powerful experience. Sexual tension, flirtation, desire, and eroticism alternate with fear, suspense, and even horror. And, of course, the brilliant direction makes you not want to blink for fear of missing even one of the impeccably designed and composed ethereal, exotic, dreamlike visions in scene after scene.I do not give a 10 rating lighting, but this film really deserves it. It is so far above the normal Hollywood fare.After seeing the film, I understand and agree with Coppola's explanation of why she chose not to include racial diversity in the cast. Because of the time period, the film would have had to address the racial divide of slavery and to do that justice would take the film in the opposite direction of Coppola's vision, which is to use an isolated group of people to show how fundamentally alike men and women are, even in a sex segregated society. A film can't be all things to all people. There are plenty of African-American films, for example, that do not address the issue of sex segregation in black culture even today. If you make sense of the world through the lens of gender stereotypes, or need big explosions to feel anything, you are probably not going to enjoy this film. But if you like complex human characters and sensuous subtlety, brilliant acting and virtuoso directing, don't miss seeing this film on the big screen.",The Beguiled

Nicole Kidman had the emotional acting range of a spoon. I was more fixated on her upper lip movements (or lack thereof) than what was being said. There could have been so much more added to the film itself. Kirsten Dunnst could have brought so much more to the movies, the same with Elle Fanning. I would have loved to have known or understood Kirsten Dunnst' characters' reacting regarding the death of Colin. Or a deeper interaction between Colin and Elle Fanning's character.The movie also finished so abruptly without any clearer explanation.

199,floralvarezr,Dreadfully artsy,6,24 November 2020,"This film is gorgeous, no question about it: the cinematography and settings are breathtaking and the acting is obviously incredible. But there barely is a story. Subtlety does not serve as an excuse for how Coppola failed to transmit an alleged underlying theme to the majority of her audience. Snobs will say the majority of people are stupid, of course. But shouldn't a good storyteller be able to get their message across with their art instead of afterwards in an interview? There is always the possibility that this movie wasn't really made for the average audience and instead is an artsy delight for a few. Which I personally think sucks. It was very easy for a few reviewers here to say that people don't like this film because it isn't fast-paced or in-you-face but that ain't it. I love indie films and would be bored to sleep by a Fast and Furious type of movie and yet I dreaded The Beguiled. I sure am not the only one. As a feminist I have to point out that it isn't rare for a female directed film to be disregarded and critiqued exclusively for that exact reason. But this isn't a feminist piece. The female characters fall into stereotypes and I wouldn't call addressing female lust by pitting women against each other for a man very empowering.

I don't mind slow films, so the slower pace didn't bother me. I think the actors probably would have done a great job too, but didn't have the opportunity, I feel they were restricted by the script. The audience doesn't really get to know too much about the characters, so they remain very one-dimensional, and I found it very difficult to empathize with them, or even care about them. It s hard to understand their motivations, feelings, cause it seems they have none or almost none, and everything they do seems very random. After a while I just gave up trying to be drawn into the films world. Maybe that is why I was not even shocked when they cut off the colonel's leg, or when they decided to poison him, and he died. I don't know how these characters were intended to be portrayed. I didn't particularly like or dislike any of them. After seeing the trailer of the film I somehow expected that there will a big turn in how the audience feels about the characters, but there were no turns or anything whatsoever, and the whole film just felt very very flat.

Being a big fan of all the ladies cast, as well as Colin, I was hopeful that fact at least would be enough to keep me entertain, but I found it over-acted in the wrong areas with a slow moving and boring climax. With a re-imagining, this could have been a suspenseful and exciting southern Gothic. Instead it was a sneeze with a few unintentional laughs (When the young girl goes to tie the blue ribbon around the gate and suddenly Colin is there, hobbling on one leg but faster than ever I had to LOL) Not sure why this film was so celebrated, and its definitely not bad, but its not that great either.",The Beguiled

It is clearly the product of a hollow echo chamber of people telling each other how wonderful they are with no input from anyone outside of their circle. I'm sorry, it's not a movie- it's a FILM. Sofia Coppola really wants us to know that. First, there's hardly a score, which means there are many silent moments and lingering shots of trees. The actors might as well be wooden dolls- they have no chemistry with one another whatsoever, and deliver their lines mechanically. And the actual plot itself is illogical. The audience laughed when Farrell's character declared his love for the schoolteacher- he'd barely spoken to her.

Unfortunately I was in for a huge disappointment. The pace was slow, dialogue laboured, scenes so darkly 'lit' my overwhelming impression of the film is endless greyness. Even the beautiful and talented Nicole Kidman couldn't lift it out of the gloom.

221,elenasurikova,Soul Eroding Effect of Hypocrisy,10,17 October 2017,"Sophia Coppola addresses one of the most overlooked problems - a ubiquitous issue of hypocrisy that is reigning in the political games lately and remains an intrinsic part of our society. An isolated group of women in the movie represents a slice of society, while Colin Farrell, an outsider, who is simply struggling to find his place within it. The outsider is condemned for putting an act, but nobody says or does anything that reflects true feelings. Nothing comes from a genuine respect for another human being. False pretenses and masquerading based on flattery is the only way the characters communicate and stay together. And unfortunately, the only way we know. The only time we see their true colors is during paroxysms of rage, outbursts of lust, hatred and jealousy. But as long as the ugliness is hidden under the veneer of a civilized decorum, it is considered all right by the majority. Jealousy or repressed sexual desires is just what we see on the surface. All the inner mechanics of their behavior are driven by the fear of a misstep in the eyes of the polite society. The morality they know teaches them to never question the rules and never step out of the dogma-ruled world. Rules like 'keep your stitches even,"" shield them from facing real moral dilemmas. The unfolding drama is depicting how morality, which it's just a set of rules established by a self-proclaimed civilized society, has replaced all spiritual concepts. Morality, as a set of standards, is bent and stretched without mercy. Anything is possible for the sake of appearances and propriety. Those who dare to break those pretensions are ostracized, banished or simply discarded. Sofia Coppola showed the modern world slipping further down into the abyss of hypocrisy, when almost everyone fails to stay true to oneself, twists ""morality"" as one pleases and values what's proper over what's right.",The Beguiled
222,sarahedgewrites,A quiet chamber piece of film making with southern aesthetic,7,6 July 2017,"I feel like Coppola's films always cake on the atmosphere and aesthetic over the story. Style over substance, but generally enough substance to please. It's the same case in The Beguiled.I'll go right ahead and say I liked this film for the fine, quiet way it depicted the south at that time. Little things like cicadas, leaves rustling and cannons in the distance really did their part to set the mood. I also loved the palette of colors chosen to represent this film. Some scenes look so old fashioned that it's as if the original film was black and white and the color was tinted in post-processing. Shots of the exterior of the mansion, the opening with the famous walking path covered in mist in which was obviously Savannah, Georgia... These exterior shots all made me wish I was there having a southern Gothic tale of my own.The Beguiled is a very simple, straightforward southern Gothic tale. There are no filler moments. It starts immediately with a very clear ""in the beginning..."" and it wraps up like a fairy tale with a clean cut ""the end."" While the story isn't complicated, the characters are.Colin Farrell's character John McBurney is wounded and carried to Ms. Farnsworth's school for girls, to be cared for until he can go on his way. They're southerners of the Confederacy and he's a Union soldier. The complications arise in their repressed sexuality and his cunning prowess at unlocking it. I found McBurney, Farrell's character, to be especially interesting. In the 1971 version with Clint Eastwood, it's clear that Eastwood's McBurney is lying through his teeth (shown in flashbacks that conflict what he tells the girls) and his intentions seem to be just charming them enough to not be turned in. In this version the McBurney character's intentions aren't as clear. I'm still confused as to what he wanted. At times he alluded to wanting to stay, other times to go and why IS he charming all the women at the same time? We don't get the answer to that either. Or perhaps Farrell's character is so good at what he does that he's actually beguiling the audience too.Unclear motives and intentions are one of the shortcomings of the film. I felt the 1971 version (it's hard not to compare) did a lot with dialogue, making as much use of it as possible. Coppola's Beguiled was too quiet at times. There were moments where certain interactions were needed. More was needed between Dunst's character Edwina and McBurney. More interactions between McBurney and the girls were needed, ones that drove the jealousy, instigated our suspicions and had purpose. Some of the dialogue in the film fell flat or came in at the wrong time. That's where this ""style over substance"" clearly shows its flaws.Kidman did a fine job with this film, but I actually felt she lacked something. She came across as stone frozen cold no matter what scene it was. There was no light-heartedness to her character. McBurney's supposed to beguile and enchant her but there was no clear moment of her heart melting or her emotion peeling away except at two scenes - 1) the moment she cleaned his body and 2) when she drinks with him after dinner. But those two scenes aren't enough to show her attraction, a very stark contrast to the 1971 version in which Geraldine Page fantasizes of a three-way with him!It's still a good film. I stand by what I said earlier. It's very complete, begins and wraps up sharp and clean. And it's beautiful in it's simplicity.I give it a solid 7/10.",The Beguiled

I typically love her work - the Virgin Suicides is timeless - but she really missed the mark with The Beguiled. It lacks the sense of horror, creepiness and urgency from the 70s classic with Clint Eastwood. The amputation scene in the original is so eerie and unsettling that you'll be on the edge of your seat. I was shocked that we didn't get a single glimpse of the amputation scene in the remake. It's the most climatic part of the story, after all. I'm deeply disappointed that Sophia decided to create such a flowery movie rather than injecting more drama, horror or suspense into the plot. She relies heavily on artsy cinematography, repetition (the film basically ends the same way it begins), and foreshadowing (we see Collin Farrell using the saw toward the beginning, which is supposed to fill us with dread about what we know is coming...which we never get to see, so the foreshadowing is a let down).

228,democratic-pizza,"Suspense, Bewildering, and Relatable in a way",8,26 August 2017,"I have always been very anticipated to see Sofia Coppola's The Beguiled ever since she successfully won the 2017 best director of Cannes. Note that I'm not a fan of all of her movies, i.e. Somewhere, but I'm a big fan of Lost In Translation and I also quite like The Virgin Suicides.This movie tells about the life of a group of girls, living in a boarding girl's school during the war. What's most interesting about the movie itself is how Coppola succeeded to create a wide picture for the viewers to imagine what it was like to be one of the girls trapped under the same roof during the colonial times. The cinematography and the close up shot angles are perfect to describe the intensity of each scene, the picturesque view, accompanied with the absence of background music which frankly worked brilliantly, in terms of creating a more vivid and uplifting moments.Following the movie stars a corporal from an army, McBurney (Collin Farrel), the only guy amongst other girls stuck in the house. Saying so, Coppola tried to plant the viewers to picture the feeling of being each of the characters. The first half of the movie mostly highlights on the girls' routine until when they accept the corporal to be a part of the house as well in their everyday lives in quite a slow pace.The movie started to get satirically funny as the girls get secretly very flirtatious towards the corporal. During this second half is where it got more ardent as the truth came at hand, where the corporal's favourite girl (Kirsten Dunst) also felt in a way 'stuck' in the world they both didn't want to be a part of, making both of them closely connected with each other romantically. From then on, the other girls started to feel envy with the other, bearing in mind that the corporal is also a philander and initially had something going on with one of the girls (Elle Fanning).I cannot say that I loved every second of it and understands how people may say it as 'boring'. I also dislike the failure of the actresses to send such message, hence sometimes can be seen as quite pretentious. In all, Coppola's remake of 1971 Clint Eastwood classic remains as original, I mean not of the plot originality, but her way of telling a story in retrospect. The conflicts brought in this movie she directed seem somewhat very possible from a mix between anger, laughter, sorrow, and envy having to come from that background (the girls' psychologically). It's certainly worth the watch and she can't possibly win a 'Cannes' with this one.",The Beguiled

I looked online at some new films out and noticed one with some pretty big Hollywood names in this film. It seemed like an interesting enough story. In my opinion, the movie was just way too slow. There seemed to be potential for much more tension and drama or even thrill-jumping music for some of the camera movements, however, I thought it fell completely flat. There was next to no character development, nothing that made me root for or against anyone.I felt that the entire film was unmotivated. Some of the insert shots I felt were random and unnecessarily long. A women three rows ahead of me actually started snoring. I can't say I blame her. The acting definitely lack lusted. The only performance I was interested in was Kirsten Dunst's and that's mostly due to her appearance - finally put on some realistic weight.I am surprised to see that it has a 7 rating. I am a film student so maybe I was expecting more from such accomplished people in the industry. The production design was a little boring to watch. There wasn't much texture. The director wanted to get a claustrophobic feel, however she had a lot of wide shots and some awkward frames so I certainly didn't get that vibe.There wasn't any music. There was nothing that pulled me into the emotions that the characters were going through. For me, the whole thing just fell completely flat.

Coppola evidently feels that suspense is built by endless shots of trees and the house in mist. Her overuse of this amateur device made me think that at any moment a commercial voice-over would declare ""Virginia is For Lovers"". And in true Coppola cliche fashion, so many scenes are so weakly illuminated. Straining to see whatever was happening, I actually screamed at my TV, ""light the damn scene!"".Other than skipping this movie, my advice to Coppola is to get out of the business.

The Beguiled is Coppola's first film after Lost in Translation to really deal with broad, overarching themes in any meaningful way and with a certain sort of humility, one that was perhaps missing from Marie Antoinette because even though that too was a fine film, its anachronistic depiction was at odds with Coppola's messaging, and far too on-the-nose.The Beguiled carries more than a whiff of The Virgin Suicides, Coppola's first and most emotionally-affecting film. It comes as no surprise to me that Sofia Coppola won Best Director for this film at Cannes (only the second female director to do so) and not the Palme D'Or, because the true achievement of this film lies not its plot but in the way Coppola captures the intricacies and manipulations of a cloistered, isolated environment. The environment in question is a girls' boarding school, run by Miss Martha Farnsworth played capably by Nicole Kidman but perhaps leaning a little more to camp than the film's other performances. Miss Martha wants to protect her girls from outside forces, but even she she slips up and lets a wounded enemy soldier McBurney, played by Colin Farrell with considerable aplomb and comfort, into the secluded orbit. This, of course, wreaks havoc as McBurney toys with the girls and women in the house, ranging from the sexually-charged Alicia (Elle Fanning in a transition to an adult role somewhat akin to Kirsten Dunst in The Virgin Suicides but with less depth and screen time) to the younger girls and even to the formidable Miss Martha herself.The true beauty and heart of this film, however, is the character of Edwina played to perfection by Sofia Coppola's muse, Kirsten Dunst. From The Virgin Suicides to Marie Antoinette and now The Beguiled, Coppola continues to plumb the depths of Dunst's range, allowing the underrated Dunst—a brilliant actress who has turned in incredible performance one after the other her whole career without once being recognized by the Academy—to give a performance for the ages. Her terse, buttoned-up, breathtakingly-desperate portrayal of a woman who had all but given up hope for a life of love outside the walls of the school is at the heart of the movie and gives its very humanity. It is also so far removed from Dunst's many other portrayals of depression, sadness, and ennui that it makes this viewer and the many critics who single out Dunst as the movie's true standout, marvel at her range, making her performance an early shoo-in for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nod.All in all, Coppola's real feat is not simply adapting the book from the female perspectives— although it is undeniably that as well—but also for directing performances that feel human and real, and not particularly dated. This version of The Beguiled has been criticized in some quarters —justifiably, in my view—for excluding the crucial character of Mattie, the slave girl who in the original Don Siegel movie is entirely impervious to McBurney's charms. It is a complicated question, one that Coppola has addressed by saying she didn't want to portray slavery clumsily or disrespectfully. On the one hand, it is true that the specter of slavery looms over this film whether Ms. Coppola wanted it to or not because of the very nature of the period. However, clocking in at 94 minutes, it is hard to imagine this movie which already has a sprawling ensemble, being able to do justice to Mattie's character and not making a bloated narrative. Without her, however, Sofia Coppola has tried to side-step the complicity of white women in slavery, inadvertently highlighting it all the more. For me ultimately it is a difficult thing to square: Sofia Coppola unquestionably continues to highlight stories about privileged white people —there's really no compelling reason why the inclusion of the African-American character would have detracted or pulled away from the movie. If anything, it would have made the already sophisticated character work more layered.Sofia Coppola has made a wonderful and nuanced movie, even if it could have been better had more complexities of the Civil War era been tackled and Coppola had been more ambitious. Nonetheless, her clear command over the film shows Coppola's deep maturity, her place as a leading American auteur, and her remarkable collaboration with Kirsten Dunst as the best career decision she has made thus far. Maybe next time, she'll be more cognizant of the responsibility that entails and won't shy away from more sensitive subjects",The Beguiled

Nicole Kidman's flaky southern accent that was sometimes British sounding, coupled with the same 3 facial expressions from Kirsten Dunst was cringe worthy to watch. Honestly, Colin Farrell was the best part. This was supposed to be a film about gender dynamics and female empowerment.

I felt they could've done a better job of developing the different tensions- Ms Martha, Edwina, Alicia and Amy. I'm not sure why the director removed so much from the original, the original needed more work too but this one left too much and seemed like they just wanted to put something out.

The Eastwood version portrayed the manipulation by McB as a deep, tricky web. Whereas this film struggled to show his true intentions. The film itself, when not compared, definitely stands on its own two legs. The reduced aspect ratio along with the production design and costume makes the civil war era come to life. The acting is as good as it gets. However, it is what is SHOWN in the film that is its downfall. The original had hypnotic and artistic moments bookending the film. It had a gut-wrenching amputation scene that this version skips over entirely. The sexual manipulation between the three main female leads by Colin Farrell's character is not as evenly spread as the original making the ending less entirely less dramatic. They have extracted much of the complexity of all the characters, such as Nicole Kidman's character's previous relationship is gone completely.

Sexuality was roused, and prospects of friendship and love were esteemed. Yet, ultimately, it was jealousy and the unfathomable mind of women which, compounded in a small society, unwittingly resulted to group-think, that in order to somehow restore perhaps their stability, the women ended up condemning and beguiling the male soldier as a consequence to merit their flaws, weaknesses and foibles.",The Beguiled

The newer version is a remake of the 1971 film starring Clint Eastwood and Geraldine Page. I'm old enough to remember when that film was released, although I saw it later on television. Well, I didn't care much for the original version and I liked the newer one about as much, which is to say not at all. The actresses and actor did the best they could with the material they were given. Yet the film seemed more like a play. Most of the film takes place inside the antebellum mansion, with some outdoor scenes of the garden and woods surrounding it.The film is set at the Farnsworth Seminary for Girls in Virginia in 1864, while the Civil War raged. The only real indication that there is a war going on is the far-off boom of cannons and the occasional appearance of some Confederate soldiers requesting food and supplies. Oh, yes, there is the arrival of a wounded Yankee soldier at the school. One of the younger girls finds him in the woods while she is out picking mushrooms. At first she is afraid of him, but he persuades her to help him get up. He has a serious leg injury. There is a way of alerting the Rebel soldiers that there is an enemy soldier on the premises. But Miss Farnsworth, the headmistress, decides that the Yankee, whose name is John McBurney, is too weak to survive were he to be taken as a prisoner. She cleans his wound and bandages the leg. John slowly begins to recover . Meanwhile, the behavior of the girls and women at the school begins to change, as they compete for John's attention, and in some cases, his affection.To call this film slow-moving would be an understatement. Yet tensions begin to mount as it becomes obvious that the situation will have no favorable resolution.I am batting 0 for 2 in terms of my Fourth of July weekend movie selections. I walked out on ""Baby Driver"" because of the violence, particularly one car crash scene that disturbed me more than anything else in the film.

In fact, my grandfather was run down while he was a pedestrian. That happened around July Fourth many years ago. I don't know whether ""Baby Driver"" glorifies violence or not. All I can say was that it was not for me, despite the film's high ratings. I guess I shouldn't listen to the critics.

The cinematography was beautiful—but the movie (except for one thing I'll mention below) felt pretty and...very empty.The reason this movie merits the rating I'm giving it is because of the *phenomenal* performance K. Dunst somehow manages to give in this movie. There's a reason she's going through a career revival, folks, and it's because she's the most interesting actress of her generation. Her heartbreaking turn in this movie is literally the only thing that anchors the movie to reality. Nicole Kidman is far too hammy, Colin Farrell almost a prop and Elle Fanning more of a trope than an actual person. But Kirsten Dunst—oh my, now there's someone at the top of her game. I'm not surprised that most reviews here single her out, but I've been a fan since Melancholia and Fargo and boy does she not disappoint. If you dislike Sofia Coppola as I do, at least give her credit for making one of the best actresses of her generation her muse.Let's talk Oscars: there's only 4 this film can realistically get: Costumes, Cinematography, Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Dunst.

I've mostly enjoyed Sofia Coppola's films found them to be playful,inventive,sometimes audacious in her choice and treatment of unconventional subject matter. Needless to say I had high expectations for The Beguiled. The present film is actually a remake of a 1971 Don Siegel original starring Clint Eastwood as the beleaguered union soldier stuck in ""enemy"" female camp. Through the magic of the internet I was able to view parts of this film and was reminded how gloriously campy,Gothic and lurid it actually was. Truly shocking and revelatory for the times in its desire to portray naked female sexuality, lust and desire. Coppola's film is a much more restrained affair striving hard to exude a certain respectfulness so as not to offend the mostly hypocritical Southern sensibilities and that's where it fails monumentally. Critics have hinted at the undercurrent of repressed sexuality but this sexuality is very much tethered to the director's primarily aesthetic considerations. Where the film needed to be bold it eschews such boldness in favor of timidity and prudence only letting forth at one pivotal moment which will dramatically change the course of the action and yet when that moment comes little preparation has led to it. There's an explosion with its unintended consequences but the trigger is barely perceptible. The film is gorgeously shot which is a trademark Coppola. That first opening scene is magnificent, the innocence of a young girl picking wild mushrooms prefigures but only just so a hint of the disruption to come. In the end I'm not certain what motives were at play here in terms of Coppola's insistence and desire to do a remake. It doesn't add any layers to the original which is much more bracing and brutal. The acting is uniformly perfect perhaps a little too perfect. Nicole Kidman is a pro at playing iciness with an undercurrent of turbulence. Although Colin Farrell brings his A game to the portrayal of wounded union soldier Corporal McBurney he never attains that primal aura of object of desire. There's a certain thugishness, roguishness to him which I suppose could be considered appealing but the chemistry isn't really allowed to flourish with so many layers draped onto it.
