0,SnoopyStyle,Fun nostalgic coming-of-age movie,8,13 August 2014,It's the summer of 1987. College student James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) is still a virgin. He needs a little bit more money to go to Europe but his parents reveal that his dad got a lesser job with less money. His parents can't pay for grad school at Columbia in NYC and James needs to get a job. He gets a summer job at the local rundown amusement park Adventureland in Pittsburg. The park is run by Paulette (Kristen Wiig) and Bobby (Bill Hader). Joel (Martin Starr) shows him the rigged games. He falls hard for co-worker Emily Lewin (Kristen Stewart). Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds) is the cool maintenance guy.It's a charming coming-of-age movie. It's got the nostalgia factor in spades. The 80s music does a lot of the work. It has the feel of familiarity and it has the comfort of a well worn genre. Writer/director Greg Mottola was the director of Superbad and has probably collected enough credibility to explain the great comedic actors here. The actors are all great from top to bottom. Wiig and Hader are hilarious together. Eisenberg returns to his usual character as a college student this time around. Kristen Stewart is the more mature woman and actually does a reasonable job as the object of desire. Ryan Reynolds is the charming rogue. Everybody does a good job.,Adventureland
1,jboothmillard,Adventureland,7,25 September 2016,"I knew the leading actor from The Social Network was in it, I knew about the setting, and I knew the critics give it a good rating, I was looking forward to whatever it had to offer, directed by Greg Mottola (Superbad, Paul). Basically set in 1987, at the beginning of summer in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, young adult James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) has graduated from Oberlin College with a comparative literature degree, but he inexperienced in many ways, including being a virgin. He has plans to spend the summer touring Europe with his best friend Eric (Michael Zegen), before heading to New York City to attend a journalism graduate school at Columbia University, but his parents, Mr. Brennan (Jack Gilpin) and Mrs. Brennan (Wendie Malick), announce they can no longer financially support him. James has no real skills, but he is forced to take the only job he can get, at a third rate amusement park called Adventureland, assistant manager Bobby (Bill Hader) assigns him to be one of many games operators, most of the games themselves are fixed. James's co- workers include the sarcastic Joel (Martin Starr); park manager and Bobby's wife Paulette (Kristen Wiig); the alluring Lisa P. (Margarita Levieva); and the park's maintenance man/technician and part-time musician Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds). James believes he has died and gone to hell, until an incident with a cheating, threatening customer brings along Emily ""Em"" Lewin (Twilight's Kristen Stewart), another games worker, who saves him, he is instantly attracted to her, and with no real experience with women, Mike takes him under his wing to give him advice. James and Em becomes good friends, slowly they embark on a relationship, and have their first kiss, but she wants to take things slowly, James is upset, and when Lisa P. asks him on a date, he eventually accepts, during it they kiss. After the date, James learns Em had called apologising for rejecting him, Joel is irritated about James being with Lisa P., James unsuccessfully tries to convince him to stop quitting, James is honest with Em about going out with Lisa P., hearing this she ends her affair with Connell. James goes to Connell's mother's house, where he apparently takes girls for sex, he is upset to see Em walk out, James spreads the word around, Em quits in anger and moves to New York, James is heartbroken, gets drunk and drives his father's car into a tree, the following morning his mother tells him he must pay for the damage with his summer earnings. James no longer has enough to attend graduate school like he wanted, but with his parents' blessing he heads to New York anyway, meeting Em at her apartment she is reluctant to talk to him, but she is touched by what he tells her, he reveals he will wait for next year to go to Columbia, and they embrace, removing their clothes, implying they will have sex. Also starring Josh Pais as Mr. Lewin, Mary Birdsong as Francy and Paige Howard as Sue O'Malley. Eisenberg is great as the vulnerable, nerdy every man, and Stewart is good as his smart but melancholy love interest, this is not the typical teen movie, most are filled with gross-out jokes and outrageous behaviour, but this one is a more heartfelt, focusing simply on the relationships between characters, and leaving room for 1980s nostalgia, a simple but most effective coming-of-age comedy drama. Very good!",Adventureland
2,Tweekums,Romance at the 'fun' park in the 1980s,7,9 December 2018,"Following his parents' change in financial situation James Brennan's promised post-graduation trip around Europe is off... in fact if he doesn't get a job so is his post-grad course at Columbia University. There isn't much work around and eventually he gets a low paid job at 'Adventureland'; a fun park where the games are rigged and the rides aren't that safe. It isn't all bad though he meets Emily 'Em' Lewin; they quickly become friends and it looks like a relationship could bloom. There will be problems though; not least that unbeknownst to James she is having an affair with a married man.If you are looking for a laugh-riot then you are likely to be disappointed; there are sufficient laughs but most of them are more gentle. There are also more downbeat elements; neither James nor Em's families are exactly what one would hope for. The romance features the expected ups and downs and possibilities that they could end up with other people, or alone. Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart impress as James and Em, making their relationship feel real. The supporting cast is pretty solid too. The '80s setting provides a good excuse for period music but it doesn't make it feel like as '80s film not that that is necessarily a bad thing. The fun park setting was good; it's slightly rundown look and the knowledge that the games were fixed added a layer of depression but also made it more enjoyably when things went well for characters. Overall I'd recommend this; just don't expect a full-on comedy.",Adventureland
3,moonspinner55,Satellites of Love (but mostly sex),6,14 November 2011,"The sexual dynamics between a group of young people in 1987 who work at a small town amusement park. Jesse Eisenberg is the indecisive high school graduate who ends up employed there, finding himself drawn to the pretty brunette teenager who runs the gaming booths. Well-cast film with a lightly-nostalgic bend, supported nicely by a barrage of pop-rock gems from the '80s on the soundtrack. It has a tendency to sneak up on you even if there aren't many surprises in the plot. The relationships between the desperately-casual kids and their uptight or turbulent parents is predictable (and formulaic), however the sequences at the park (particularly with Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig as the supervisors) are bracing and funny. Not a barn-burner by any means, and padded with silly asides and prurience, but with smart little nuances and a memorable scenario. **1/2 from ****",Adventureland
4,Quinoa1984,a sweetheart of a movie: funny but totally endearing and nostalgic,9,3 April 2009,"The big label on top of the title of the poster of Adventureland says ""from the director of Superbad"". This is a given since it's true, they have the same director, but from the look of the poster and by some of the ads it looks to be very much in the vein of the gross-out sex gags and super vulgar humor that populated much of Superbad: teens will sneak in thinking they'll get more of that only this time at an amusement park. This is not the case, that should be made very clear... and yet there is something of a similarity. However gross Superbad might have been, the connection to the characters was strong because Greg Motolla didn't put up false barriers or a sense that despite the outrageousness these weren't real teens - they have real aspirations past getting drunk and having sex. And now, in his more personal outing Adventureland, he moves on to make something that strays even more towards romantic drama than Apatow-company-linked comedy.It's a little like Woody Allen goes to an 80s party. I should explain: this isn't the super funny Allen I refer to, but the one who could strike a deep chord in revealing things about people in relationships, their flaws made succinct but also to make what we can like about them so relatable. Adventureland features some of the most identifiable early 20-somethings I've seen in a Hollywood movie in a while, and at the same time Motolla side-swipes past the clichés that bog down romantic comedies or romance dramas. If there's some familiarity that's to be expected: there's been first-love stories since sound movies began, and there will be more. But you feel the awkwardness without it being too awkward or self-knowing or ""hip"" like so many movies are about young people in their crossroads, and you feel that there's some troubling things going on with people who are intelligent in the midst of one of those ""that-summer-this-happened"" stories.It's about James Brennan, who comes back from college to find his parents don't have the money for him to go to Europe for the summer before Grad school (or even for Grad school for that matter) and has to get a job without any real past job experience (he's a romantic-lit major). So, Adventureland, a typical amusement park with the silly games and the giant pandas nobody wins and the inedible corn-dogs, is where he ends up, and finds a friend in nerdy Joel and a girlfriend in Em. Em, meanwhile, is having a fling with a married man several years older, the park mechanic Connell, who is supposed to be a big-shot for playing in a band that opened for Lou Reed. It's the ""summer-this-happened"" story, with plenty of idiosyncrasies that lead up to a lot by the end of it all.What I responded to on top of the characters, who are never less than three-dimensional (this is about the highest praise imaginable, I would hope, for this type of young-romance story, since so many rarely have 2D), is the bittersweetness of what happens. You can feel the weight of scenes where Kristen Stewart, a wonderful actress, is straining to hide away her affair with Connel while trying to actually have fun with James (played by very good by Eisenberg, continuing his streak from Squid & the Whale) AND balance that with the already crappy home-life she has with a deceased mother and b****y step-mother. The script doesn't take any easy routes, and it never really judges anyone too harshly - just enough to make sense of what it was like in retrospect. It is self-knowing, but in the best way from experience and a loving sense of time and place.And in case you're wondering since the IMDb genre is for the moment only listed as comedy, there are some good comedy scenes and moments, specifically from Bill Hader as the boss at Adventureland. There's both subtlety and over-the-top bits to his comedy, such as when he's looking at the deliberately sexy Lisa P and says ""Nah, I'm a one man woman"" or when he goes from zero to eleven by raging at a guy who's gunning after James over a spat - and then goes back to zero again. Adventureland is really the most realistic kind of dramedy one could hope for right now, and it reveals a filmmaker who will not shortchange his audience with his characters. It's a vibrant, touching little movie, absolutely perfect for the young date-movie crowd, with an amazing soundtrack to boot.",Adventureland
5,studioAT,Nowhere near as good as is claimed,3,30 June 2017,"This is a decent enough film, with a likable cast. It's got an interesting enough premise, and a good soundtrack.However I think it has been looked at with rose tinted specs by those who proclaim it as a modern day classic, and the sort of film that the late, great John Hughes would've been making today.I mean, it's good, but it's not great. It has too much bad language for my taste, as well as an over reliance on sex for the source of its humour.I think those people need to take the specs off and see it for what it is.",Adventureland
6,hitchcockthelegend,Mottola strikes one from the heart.,8,19 September 2009,"It's 1987 and James Brennan is home for the summer after earning himself a degree in Renaissance Studies. Which unsurprisingly isn't any use to him when trying to gain employment in this part of Pittsburg. Which is now a problem since his planned trip to Europe has fell by the wayside due to his father's enforced unemployment. So thus he finds himself working at Adventureland, a rusting time warp amusement park where only odd balls and idiots appear to frequent. But here James will make friends, learn life lessons and maybe just find true love?Be under no illusions, Adventureland is no teen sex comedy reliant on crude jokes and cringe slap-stick moments to get its humour. Which as it's brought to us by the director of Superbad may come as something of a surprise. Greg Mottola is the said director, who here has crafted an ode to his own teenage strife's concerning first jobs and first loves. Tho not really offering anything new as such, I mean the old ""summer I came of age"" film is hardly new is it? Mottola has however managed to blend youthful spirits with a serious kink and nicely cloak it in a bittersweet 80s haze.Tho some parts are clearly aimed at the guffaw teen viewers, awkward erections and friends who punch you in the testicles-tee hee hee, Adventureland feels, and is, a subtle film made by someone who clearly lived it. The care and thought that Mottola has put into it benefits the cast as much as it does the viewers. Jesse Eisenberg {James} is a splendid bit of casting, almost poetically slow, he nicely plays it to have the upcoming tribulations totally believable. Enter Kristen Stewart as Em, pretty and smartly essaying a girl, soon to be woman, trying to make sense in her off kilter world. Her scenes with both Eisenberg and the buff Ryan Reynolds, in a role that takes some skill to get as right as he does, are the highlights of the piece. While Martin Starr is the other performance of note as the pipe smoking intellectual, Joel.What youngsters that I know who have seen the film have had less than favourable reactions to it. This can probably be put down to two things. One is that the expectation of another Superbad-a-like comedy has not been met. Two is that, you know what folks? Mottola hasn't made this for kids, he's made it for those who were kids once in a decade not so very long ago...... 8.5/10",Adventureland
7,jotix100,The virgin nerd,8,12 July 2010,"James Brennan's prospect for an European trip gets derailed as this story begins. The senior Brennan has been demoted to a lower position that does not pay what the former job did. James, who had set his eyes in moving to New York after the vacation in order to attend Columbia University, sees his dreams come crashing down when he has to stay in Pittsburgh for the summer.Having no prospects for a decent paying job, he applies at a suburban amusement park that has seen better days. James position as an attendant in one of the games' booth is explained to him by the owner of the park, Bobby, who warns him about a rule James must keep in mind: no one wins the big assed Panda. The other attendants he meets at Adventureland are kids like himself trying to save some money for college. His co-workers are a motley crew.James is attracted to Em, a strange girl who sticks out from the rest because of her direct way of speaking her mind. Em carries a big secret within her; she has been having an affair with a mechanic from the park who happens to be married. James has no clue about what is going on, but he is definitely experiencing love, perhaps for the first time. Being a virgin, James does not know how to channel what he feels for Em, or how to make the move that will make her care for him.""Adventureland"" is about the third feature directed by the immensely talented Greg Mattola, whose ""The Daytrippers"" and ""Superbad"" proved he is a new voice in the American cinema. Mr. Mottola, who also wrote the screenplay was blessed by the young cast he assembled to give life to his vision. The film is a coming of age account about a young man at a difficult time of his life. The director works in subtle ways and the people that populate the comedy feel real.Jesse Eisenberg, has made a career out of playing the kind of likable nerd one has known at one point, or another. Kristen Stewart is another delight in the film. Her Em is nuanced and shows great signs of intelligence. Ryan Reynolds, always reliable to give a good performance, turns up as Connell, a former guitarist, now working as a mechanic in the amusement park, a legend who cheats on his wife, and whose life is a mess. Others in supporting roles include Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader, Martin Starr, Wendie Mallick, Jack Gilpin, among others.A surprisingly entertaining film thanks to Greg Mottola.",Adventureland
8,Scarecrow-88,Adventureland,8,15 June 2010,"From the director of the ridiculously popular SUPERBAD comes this fun dramedy set in the 80's about a young man, James(Jesse Eisenberg)who has been accepted to Columbia University but must work at a Summer amusement park in order to come up with the money needed to attend school. This is where is meets a beautiful, but sullen, girl named Emily(Kristen Stewart)whose father, a lawyer, married the woman he was screwing as her mother was dying of cancer. Em is having an affair with local hunk Connell(Ryan Reynolds), known for his lothario ways(mostly with 18 year old girls who fall for his charms), and things get complicated when she starts dating James. There's a spark between James and Em, they can communicate with each other and seem very comfortable with one another. We follow the summer romance and conflicts which surface in Em and James' relationship.Martin Starr steals the film as a co-worker of James', Joel, kind of a weirdo with lots of strange phrases he uses to address people, places, and events. He's a smart loser who seems trapped in his job and small burg with little in the way of a future..he's my kind of guy, actually, and I had friends just like him, because, truth be told, I found them more human and easy to be around than any of the more ""pretty boys"" with all their money and play-pretties. Anyway, there's this sex pot named Lisa P(Margarita Levieva) everyone lusts after..she's your typical eye candy, who is all surface hotness without anything interesting personality-wise. Lisa P is the gal you beat your meat to while Em(who I would've beat my meat to if I had been in James' shoes)is the one you really want to get to know, to be around, to establish conversations with. Em harbours a mystery about her, doesn't really say a lot, but there's something about her that intrigues you. She's not overly dramatic, or immature, or even off-putting as a Lisa P would be..Lisa P is the kind who knows all the boys stare at her, imagining ways they'd like to pleasure her, while Em is the gal you'd rather hang around with on sleepy, rainy afternoons. Director Greg Motola does what he can to make sure we realize this is an 80's movie, using music and certain pop culture references(including a television special with Ronald Reagan)throughout..my favorite is the use of the song ""Amadeus"" which infuriates James because it is used on a certain ""music game"" near the stand where he works. A lot of pot smoking in this movie as many employees come to James for ""little joints"" as they sneak off in areas without supervision or after work to relax and take their minds off of life for a while. ADVENTURELAND, I think, works it's magic because Eisenberg is so appealing..I love the fact that nerds have become the stars of certain movies and Motola has made a mark by presenting them as characters to embrace wholeheartedly. Just a fine summer movie for us 80's kids who remember what it was like to fall in love, and the pains that come with it. I think this will also work it's spell because of the specific backdrop for most of the film. I like how Eisenberg's character is more authentic and real while Connell comes off as an attractive phony whose looks are his only asset besides his skills as a mechanic(he fixes broken rides and machines in the amusement park, which is really the only time Connell and James really talk).",Adventureland
9,dbborroughs,"it didn't work for me, then again neither did Super Bad",5,2 October 2009,"Based on the directors time at the amusement park located not far from my home this is an okay coming of age film about a kid who's forced to get a job at Adventureland in order to help pay for college. Romance and other adventures are on the menu. Good but not really remarkable film didn't really click with me. Perhaps its the pacing, perhaps its the sense of having seen a good deal of it before, this film just sort of blurred past my eyes. Yes it was nice to see how the games of chance are fixed, and yes some of the emotion between the will they or won't they romantic couple was nicely raw and real, but the rest of it seemed awfully cartoonish. Its not bad, its just not quite up to some of the rave reviews that some reviewers and some friends gave it. (Then again what do I know I didn't like the directors Super Bad.)",Adventureland

So, let's just look at the movie and pretend that there are no stars in it. Hey, there are no stars in it! The lead, Jesse Eisenberg from The Squid and the Whale, fails to find meaningful employment for the summer, so he gets a job at Adventureland.While everyone is panting over Lisa P (Margarita Levieva), he is getting head over heels with Em (Stewart), who I think has a vampire boyfriend. Oh, that's something else, she has a mechanic/musician/married lover (Ryan Reynolds).The whole film is about friendships and friends and relationships and growing up and, well, getting laid.

11,zardoz-13,Neat Fun!!!,8,18 June 2009,"Mellow but formulaic comedy set in Pittsburgh in 1987 about a high school graduate (Jesse Eisenberg) who takes a job at an amusement park because his parents cannot afford to send him on a European vacation.The theme of the last finish first is played out to the hilt in ""Superbad"" director Greg Mottola's movie. Really there is nothing new here but Jesse Eisenberg makes a perfect nerdy hero and ""Twilight"" star Stewart is ideal as the other woman. Ryan Reynolds is incredibly low-key here as the amusement park mechanic who takes his dates over to his mother's house to have sex with them because he is married and doesn't want his wife to find out about his amorous affairs. Martin Starr is exceptional as a nerdy Jewish guy. In the vein of ""Caddyshack"" without the full-throttle raunchy humor.""Adventureland"" makes smoking pot look therapeutic while whiskey gets a bad rap.

12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Worse things have happened to the Jews,7,22 July 2014,"1987. A bunch of youths who are still stuck living at home with their parents have to save up money for college and take Summer jobs in the titular amusement park. Among the unwinnable games, all of these odd types unintentionally form a sort of dysfunctional family. James(Eisenberg, nerdy and neurotic) starts falling for Em(Stewart, her being her usual moody self fitting this, and him, they're cute together), but things are a little complicated. For one thing, she secretly has a thing with Mike(Reynolds, charming as usual, former big time musician), even though he's married.Outside of one or two chunks where a lot happens, this is uneventful. It's pretty slow, even though the 96 minutes sans credits(102 minutes with) don't really drag. The teen romance is relatively conventional in its progression, but it's also realistic and engaging. With 40 80's pop songs, this has a very distinct sense of setting. It's very indie – small, personal, intimate. This isn't a laugh-out-loud comedy, albeit it can be funny. There's enough quirk to go around, with awkward interactions, especially on dates talking past each other, half-answering, ignoring, misreading nonverbal cues.This contains some drug content, strong language and sexuality, as well as brief bloody violence. I recommend this to anyone who wants this kind of story. 7/10",Adventureland

Funny and at times hit-the-nail-on-the-head accurate look at teens circa 1987 with Eisenberg as a college grad looking to make some extra cash for a European vacation by working at the titular amusement park in Pittsburg, PA where he gets some life lessons and falls in love with no-nonsense yet troubled Stewart and in the process having a lot of fun amidst the misery of the soul-crushing reality of a truly sucky seasonal gig. Filmmaker Greg Mottola's authenticity is downright uncanny in the pangs of adolescence and young adulthood's strangleholds impinged by society; does for summer jobs what CADDYSHACK did for golf courses.

15,neil-476,Excellent character piece,8,13 June 2010,"I finally caught up with Adventureland ages after being attracted by the trailers.Jesse Eisenberg is James, forced to work at a rather seedy fun park in order to fund college. The unworldly James becomes taken with similarly aged Em (Kristen Stewart), not realising that she is secretly in the middle of the major mistake of an affair with married mechanic / musician Connell (Ryan Reynolds). What follows is a gently developing romantic relationship, enhanced with lots of character based amusement. This is not a comedy as such, although it is frequently amusing. It certainly isn't a teen comedy in the current fashion - sex is a part of it, but this isn't a sex comedy. Neither is it full of toilet humour, bodily fluids and so on, although there is a character (only one!) who is particularly annoying because of his habit of genitally assaulting James. He wouldn't stay my best friend for long, that's for sure.I really liked this film. The characters came across as genuine, realistic, truthful, and likable. Even Connell, a married man sneaking off to have sex with a teenager, is fundamentally a nice guy, just a weak one.All the cast are good, but I liked both Jesse Eisenberg and Kirsten Stewart. I was particularly pleased to discover how much I liked Kirsten Stewart's bruised Em, especially after disliking the character she plays in the Twilight movies so much. We see enough of Em to understand why she is following a potentially self-destructive path, and how the growing relationship with James could be as good for her as it could be for him, and we hope that they manage to find a way to make it work.And the script is good, too.",Adventureland
16,evanston_dad,"A Whiny, Hopelessly Immature Coming-of-Age Movie",4,22 September 2009,"The current Judd Apatow/Seth Rogen posse of directors/actors/writers have lately made so many movies so quickly about boys becoming men that a mini-genre has developed, complete with its own batch of over-used clichés. ""Adventureland,"" the latest coming-of-age film from Greg Mottola (of ""Superbad"" fame), is nothing but a collection of the most tired of these clichés applied to a storyline and a group of characters I didn't give a hoot about.Jesse Eisenberg, a less appealing version of Michael Cera, plays a recent college graduate who sees his dream of attending Columbia University's graduate program crumble when his parents flake out about giving him the money for it. He ends up having to get a (horror of horrors!) summer job at a dreary amusement park called Adventureland. During the summer he falls for a girl that, true to the conventions of the genre, is such a drip we can't imagine what it is he sees in her, and he learns how to stop relying on his parents and make that voyage into adulthood.Or I guess that's what happens, because at the end he ends up in NYC getting laid by his dream girl. But the coming-of-age part of the film is left terribly vague, and the spoiled privileged kid we get at the film's beginning seems to be pretty much the same spoiled privileged kid we get at the end.""Adventureland""s biggest failing is that it doesn't poke enough fun at the main character. The filmmakers treat him without a trace of irony; they actually seem to think he deserves our sympathy for having to deal with such horrible parents and for learning life lessons the rest of us learned before we were even out of high school, let alone college. Jesse Eisenberg isn't likable enough to make up for the writer's and director's deficiencies, and I found my patience taxed beyond its limits.The rest of the movie is poorly cast. Ryan Reynolds shows up as a musician/handyman, despite the fact that he's not remotely believable as either; Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig play the husband and wife owners of Adventureland and act like they belong in a completely different movie; and Wendie Malick and Jack Gilpin play our protagonist's parents as one-note caricatures.What a lame movie.Grade: C-",Adventureland
17,anaconda-40658,An Adventureous Summer Job!,9,29 April 2015,"Adventureland (2009): Dir: Greg Mottola / Cast: Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Ryan Reynolds, Bill Hader, Martin Starr: Teen comedy that remembers the joys and heartaches of youth. Jesse Eisenberg plays a college graduate who works at an amusement park during the summer. Director Greg Mottola has fun with the location and really gives viewers an idea of what working at such a job is like. He previously scored big with Superbad, which is also a comedy about youth. Eisenberg does well experiencing one's first job and romance. Kristen Stewart plays off one's anger towards parents and the false security of wrong relationships. Her father is involved with a woman whom she spites due too the phoniness. Unfortunately, as many of these films do, they seem to solve their issues with sex in a manner that seems taken for granted. Ryan Reynolds plays a maintenance worker having a marital affair with Stewart. He symbolizes males who can achieve affection from beautiful women but cannot commit. He does commit to helping his mother though, which allows him some sympathy. Bill Hader steals scenes as the theme park manager with amusing methods to restoring order. Martin Starr plays an employee who has no luck with women but bonds with Eisenberg. Winning comedy that reflects one's first job and the baggage that makes it all memorable. Score: 9 / 10",Adventureland
18,phd_travel,Likable cast and refreshing story,9,9 August 2010,This is a realistic yet entertaining romantic dramedy. The characters are all likable and their flaws and weaknesses are human. No one is unpleasant to watch. The ending is satisfying. It's not a teen comedy - it's for slightly more emotionally mature audiences. There are also good amounts of humor throughout as well. Jesse does a good job - he is not annoying unlike some of the geeky anti heroes of today. Kristen is complex and attractive in a very down to earth way. Supporting cast are amusing too from the parents to Matt Bush to Ryan Reynolds. Liked this more than 500 Days of Summer which was a little depressing.There is a lesson to be learnt - that although people aren't perfect but things can still work out.,Adventureland
19,Mr-Fusion,A meandering '80s comedy that's crippled by poor casting,5,27 June 2011,"Greg Mottola's semi-autobiographical 'Adventureland' is a frustrating film. It's happiest in the saddle of the John Hughesian teen angst of the '80s (though the characters are all twenty-somethings), but wallows in the misery of just how crappy life is when your high hopes are dashed.Jesse Eisenberg is James Brennan, fresh out of college and looking forward to a Summer trip to Europe. His travel plans are squashed when his Dad gets downsized, and Brennan's forced to take on a Summer job just to have enough rent money for Columbia in the fall (the absence of Bananarama's ""Cruel Summer"" on the soundtrack is a real wasted opportunity here). But he's unqualified for even manual labor, so he's left to take a job at Adventureland ... quite possibly the chintziest amusement park I've ever laid eyes on.Much of the film's humor derives from Brennan's misery. He's brainy, awkward; an idealist whose just been dealt a losing hand (by any standard). And Eisenberg is excellent the role. He wears the anxiety and ill-fortune of Brennan like a glove. And it's not just Eisenberg. Most of the cast here is terrific. One of the film's greatest strengths is the interactions between Brennan and those other poor souls around him who have been forced to do time in Adventureland.At the core of the film is a love story. And it's here where things get rocky. Brennan falls for Em (Kristen Stewart), a self-hating product of a broken home who's currently sleeping with a married man. Sure, there's enough drama there to keep things interesting, but it also serves to bring the film down.But it certainly doesn't help matters that the girl Brennan falls for (the same girl who makes the job bearable) is played by one of the most ineffectual actresses I've ever seen on screen. To say there's no chemistry between these two is an understatement. I can't look at Stewart and get anything but the vacant stare of someone who just doesn't care. And that's where things fall apart. The romantic thrust of this narrative is torpedoed by an actress who comes off as completely unfeeling.5/10",Adventureland
20,Smells_Like_Cheese,"The place where you will never win a giant-ass panda, come to Adventureland!",8,8 July 2010,"Ever have that summer where you had the worst job in the world, but somehow the best time of your life? Welcome to Adventureland as we go through this journey with James. I had heard little good things about this movie last year, so I caught the movie on Showtime and decided to check it out. Greg Mottola who also wrote Superbad wrote this movie based on some personal experiences of his. He is starting to remind me a little of John Hughes, Superbad was his Sixteen Candles and now Adventureland is his Pretty in Pink. Greg did a great job creating this charming coming of age story that a lot of us can relate too. The whole setting was also awesome, with a lot of teenage films we get a lot of technology that seems so out of place to me in the hands of such young adolescents. In the 1980's, it was about partying and just living your life instead of being on the computer or watching TV. The only slight flaw with this was that it seemed like they had to have some stereotypes to remind us constantly that we were in the 80's, if you take a look at our world while we have some trendy people around us, it's not that common to meet several at the same time unless you're in LA or New York. But it's a minor complaint with this great story.In the summer of 1987 James has just graduated college. He is looking forward to touring Europe for the summer and going to graduate school with a Masters Degree in journalism when his parents tell him they won't be able to help him financially. James looks for summer jobs, but can only find one, at Adventureland, a local amusement park where his childhood friend Frigo works. James is hired immediately by the assistant manager, Bobby, and is assigned to the games area. He meets some of his co-workers: Joel, Paulette, Lisa P., and the park's repairs technician Mike Connell. James meets another games worker, Emily, after she saves him from being stabbed by a disgruntled customer. She later invites him to a party at her house. The following day, James tells Connell about his strong feelings for Em, which Connell tells Emily. Wanting to take things slow, James goes out with Lisa P. But almost in a competition that he's not aware of with Mike Connell who is sleeping with Emily, he must make a decision during this summer wither it's time to grow up or not.I really liked how Adventureland had dimensional characters, normally with a romance story, it's so simple and unrealistic. As for our two leads, Kristen and Jesse, not so strong actors but their chemistry worked enough to where they are very watchable on screen. One of the things I appreciated was that Ryan Reynold's character, he's a jerk who cheats on his wife, but he's also made to be very human, he's a likable personality, he's just doing jerk things. But it's Bill Hader who once again in the movies manages to steal the scenes that he's in as James' boss, Bobby. Bill is just a great comedic actor with awesome timing, he reminds me of Dan Aykroyd, looks and personality and I think he's going to go much farther in his career. Adventureland has the making to be a classic down the line, it has a lot of charm and class that the teenage movies of the 80's had as well, not treating the teenagers as immature kids but young adults who are coming of age. I would recommend this movie, it's a little gem that I'm glad I had the pleasure of watching.8/10",Adventureland
21,Buddy-51,richly observed coming-of-age tale,8,28 January 2010,"Upon graduating from college, James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) finds himself with a degree in Comparative Literature and Renaissance Studies - and little else of the stuff to build a successful life on. Forced by financial constraints to move back in with his parents, James takes a summer job as a carny at a seedy amusement park known as Adventureland (the movie was shot at Pittsburgh's Kennywood Park). His fellow sufferers-in-purgatory include his even more geeky friend, Joel (Martin Starr); his tormentor from elementary school, Frigo (Matt Bush); the elusive girl-of-his-dreams, Emily (Kristen Stewart); hunky security manager, Mike (Ryan Reynolds), who, though married, has got a secret thing going on the side with Emily; sexy hot bombshell, Lisa P (Margarita Levieva); and, finally, two park supervisors played by SNL regulars Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, whose function is to add some understated goofiness to the movie's otherwise gently realistic tone.Based partly on the experiences of writer/director Greg Mottola (who established his bona fides in the genre a few years back with ""Superbad""), ""Adventureland"" is one of those rare youth comedies in which the characters actually come across as real people and not as contrivances paying script-service to a typical coming-of-age story. Mottola's flavorful script nicely captures the rhythms and tones of everyday speech. In fact, much of the humor derives from the fact that James, fresh from his immersion in liberal arts academia, often has a hard time reeling in his Ivy League phrasing and diction when engaging in everyday conversations with his fellow workers.As James, the perpetually tongue-tied 23-year-old virgin who wears his heart on his sleeve, Eisenberg perfectly captures all the insecurity and awkwardness of a young man utterly inexperienced in the ways of love and romance. In fact, there's not an unappealing performance from any member of the cast. And perhaps because the characters are of a somewhat more advanced age here, Mottola never lets the teen-movie hijinks get out of hand despite many opportunities to do so.Thanks to the movie's being set in 1987, the soundtrack provides a veritable treasure-trove of great, nostalgia-evoking tunes from that era (the highlight being Crowded House's incomparable ""Don't Dream It's Over"") to transport us back in time.Badly marketed at the time of its release (the ads made it look like just another lame-brained, teen-raunch fest), ""Adventureland"" is a sweet, perceptive and heartwarming film that proves there's quite a bit of life left in that creaky old coming-of-age genre after all.",Adventureland
22,thesar-2,Dramaland,5,3 March 2013,"It would be too long of a list for actors who are severely typecast, so to be more topical, let's just narrow it down to the sad, melancholy, damaged, depressed and negative character Kristen Stewart is always playing.I've only seen a handful of her performances, and with EACH one, she nails that role, including this one in Adventureland. In her defense, she's awesome in this Goth-without-the-black role she's forcing on us. In opposition, it is, in fact, depressing to see her always bring down the house around her and the characters that have to spend 80% of the film attempting to bring her up.On the bright side, the snap-witted and always impressive Jesse Eisenberg was cast to be one of the oppositions whose job is to fruitlessly make Stewart's character feel good, even if just for a few seconds of screen time. 'Course, then she's back to her gloomy demeanor and her hand back through her hair.Adventureland, or more accurately, Dramaland, follows James (Eisenberg) through the 1987 summer of working at a local amusement park to earn enough to make it to the Big Apple. There he meets very few interesting characters, but nonetheless, falls in love, lust and develops both relationships and I'm guessing, himself. (I ""guess"" because I saw little difference in his character from the start of the summer to the final shot. A tad bit of elevated confidence, but other than that, nada.)At first, I questioned the not-so-coming-of-age story being set in 1987, but along the way, I tremendously enjoyed the soundtrack and mildly took pleasure in the tiny bit of other nostalgia: real video games and clothes. The soundtrack was great, because it didn't go full-force into the stereotypical 1980s tunes that these movies generally do. There was a wide section of known ones to ""new to me"" that I liked a lot.I suppose they were original with not having the normal ""sidekicks"" to our love-struck-story ""hero."" Sadly, they strayed so far away from the norm, 70% were established in their perspective acting ability, but just plain, well, plain. With the exception of the hilarious park owners, Bobby (Bill Hader) and even more outrageously funny, Paulette (Kristen Wiig), most of the pawns at the park might have been possibly realistic, but they weren't terribly interesting or funny. The poster that bragged ""From the director of Superbad"" might have drawn me in, but eventually would've disappointed me with his lack of attention to the supporting cast.Overall, despite the far-too-long running time, I marginally liked the course served: the cinematography was very decent and again the soundtrack awesome. But, those were incidental to another entertaining romp of absolutely hilarious Eisenberg one-liners. If you're a fan of his, or, ah-hem, a fan of Sad Stewart, you'll probably enjoy a ride at this amusement park.Side Note: Oh, and I hate horrible actions without consequences in films as this does nothing less than telling our youths it's okay to commit them. This is why I hated Project X so dearly. Here, drinking and driving seems to be the standard amongst the townsfolk, and only one scene seemed to give a character an all-but slap on the wrist and, of course, he felt zero remorse. I'm curious, did less people die back in 1987 from drunk drivers, or was it ""funny"" and just more widely accepted by society?",Adventureland

24,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Has its issues but is an entertaining and even somewhat endearing low-fi slice-of-life drama.,6,17 April 2018,"'Adventureland (2009)' is a part of the low-fi indie movement that was originally refreshing but quickly became over-saturated, a slice-of-life drama that tries to reflect reality yet still retain a written narrative. As such, its initial stylings aren't anywhere near as charming as they are perhaps intended to be. The lead character is annoying due to Eisenberg's inherent motor-mouthed arrogance masquerading as shy quirkiness (essentially every role he has ever played) wearing thin faster than it's even presented, the period time-setting is only as relevant as the fact that no mobile phone is ever seen, and there are a number of conveniently unexplained coincidences that hinder the believability of some key developments. Still, the majority of the piece is entertaining and even somewhat endearing, capturing an aimlessness and nostalgia that's, at times, somewhat accurate. It's subtly funny on occasion, too. This is mostly thanks to Bill Hader, whose improvisational moments really shine here. 6/10",Adventureland

I find this movie as more of a drama and a coming of age story. This is not the comedy that was described in the trailers. Yes, there are a few funny parts. But, I wasn't laughing like I do in any other comedy movies.This film is set at an amusement park back in 1987. Basically, this tells the story of a guy named James Brennan. His parents are being transferred to a lower-paying job so Brennan had to jet a job. At the park, he learns a lot about coming of age. There is also one girl...The acting is really good. I liked them all. But my favorite character is Ryan Reynolds. He is the real punk guy in this film. I liked the girls. They are really beautiful.I didn't like how the studio misadvertised this film. Even though this film got good reviews from the critics, this movie should have done better at the box office. I really liked this film. I rate this film 9/10.",Adventureland
27,cricketbat,This movie is over-dramatic and pessimistic,3,10 July 2018,I thought Adventureland was going to be funny and entertaining - it was neither. This movie is over-dramatic and pessimistic.

28,lesleyharris30,"A Well Acted, Meaningful Comedy,",8,12 January 2016,"Adventureland is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific comedic cast that are a also able to be dramatic when they have to. It's a very funny movie, but it never gets too carried away with its comedy, which I really liked, every joke was meaningful and was used in order to developed the characters, establishing their relationships, several of them are very relatable, particularity James and Em, I'm sure anyone who watches this movie will find their friendship similar to one you may have had, there are countless aspects to them that are very human. The only thing about this movie that bothered me was the fact that there are just so many characters that are intriguing that by the end several of them felt underdeveloped, particularly Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig's characters, they were brilliant in all their scenes and I loved the dynamics between them, but they simply aren't in it enough, and I was left wanting to know much more about Bobby and Paulette. The cast is outstanding, and they are all very well able to do both hilarious scenes, as well as dramatic, serious moments, ranging from Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Martin Starr, Ryan Reynolds and Michael Zegen, I felt for and understood all these characters, which goes to show just how good their performances really were. A great script and a stunning cast, Adventureland is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy drama.

30,zkonedog,"Not Nearly In The Same League As, Say, Zombieland",2,25 February 2017,"I found the movie ""Zombieland"" to be a rollicking good time, which is why I gave this flick a chance. ""Adventureland"", however? Not even in the same league despite the lead actor playing a very similar role.For a basic plot summary, ""Adventureland"" is the story of James (Jesse Eisenberg), a college student all set up for a grand trip across Europe. That is, until his parents hit the skids and the money dries up. Instead, it's off to look for a summer job, which he finds at the carnival theme park Adventureland. There he meets fellow worker Em (Kristin Stewart), where a complicated relationship ensues.The main trouble with ""Adventureland"" is that it doesn't seem to have any sense of purpose. It sort of just meanders from one scene to the next and just fizzles out as it goes along. I'm usually very engaged in the movie-watching experience (phone down, no distractions, etc.), but halfway through this one even I was getting antsy. It just didn't go anywhere. It also seemed to hit a bit of a climax about halfway through, where I wondered ""how can an entire hour possibly be left in this film?"".Eisenberg is a solid actor, but his ""awkward kid"" shtick doesn't play as well here without a lot of other things going on. In ""Zombieland"", for instance, there's so much other action that his bits are more comic relief. They are asked to carry the show here, and that approach flops. Not helping matters is the un-expressive Stewart (it isn't just a ""Twilight"" thing). Yes she is beautiful, but I never felt any true emotion radiating from her. Whether excited or sad, laughing or crying, Stewart always has kind of those ""dead eyes"" going on that make it difficult to really identify with the emotions she is feeling.Thus, ""Adventureland"" was one of the worst films I've seen in quite some time. I'm not bored easily by cinema, but this one did the trick.",Adventureland
31,Floated2,a good mixture of drama and comedy,7,1 August 2010,"Adventureland is one of those movies that had misleading trailers. I've seen it said that this movie suffered from false advertising, and it most certainly did. The commercials and trailers told us to expect another wacky comedy in the vein of such films as Superbad and Knocked Up! Not that I saw those movies, but when I watched Adventureland, it was because I was in the mood for something funny and for better or worse, it wasn't exactly a comedy. This was more of a romantic drama. That wasn't bad but not what I was really expected More of a classic coming of age type movie where we meet all these characters working at the amusement park as they are at certain crossroads of their lives. With my background and the way I grew up, I didn't exactly relate to these characters a whole lot, but it was interesting to watch them deal with the things that popped up in their various experiences. Most of the actors were good in their roles and the roles themselves avoided teen-movie cliché-ing. Some may have had specific quirks, but they felt like real people, not just ""the geeky kid"" ""the cool girl"" etc, etc.Many critics I've read from said great positive things about the movie and I can see why critics loved this thing. I think it was well written with a good story but it really wasn't that funny. I guess it wasn't trying to be funny, it was more based on love with sex, drugs, and other things. There were also a lot of F-bombs used. The movie was decent but not great like some say",Adventureland
32,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Natural laughs are the goal of 80s period twist on modern comedy,9,21 April 2009,"The first thing to know about ""Adventureland"" is that although it was directed and written by Greg Mottola (""Superbad"") and it has Bill Hader in it, it is in know way in the mainstream vein of Judd Apatow-brand comedies. It's not outrageously dirty or over-the-top hysterical ever. It prides itself on humor through character and the natural awkwardness of life. Taking place at a theme park in Pittsburgh in the 80s, it's a modern-spirited but definite period comedy.Period comedies seem to always revolve around coming-of-age stories. There seems to be a natural connection between the nostalgia of an era and reflecting on personal choices and the pivotal moments of growing up. ""Adventureland"" is an 80s period comedy, but it's not necessarily a coming-of-age story. The protagonist is James (Jesse Eisenberg), a recent college grad, who while inexperienced in the ways of romance, at least knows who he is and what he wants from life in the long term. He's not growing up, but he's facing some harsh realities after his dad gets demoted and he can no longer afford that summer trip of a lifetime to Europe with his best friend.His only option is a summer job working at Adventureland, where he meets his colorful and strange employers (Saturday Night Live's Hader and Kristen Wiig), a new dork friend named Joel (Martin Starr, who has played minor roles in bigger comedies) and of course the laid back but emotionally distressed girl of his dreams (""Twilight"" phenom Kristen Stewart). So what looks like a bum summer turns into a chance for James, a nerdy, awkward virgin, to reevaluate things.Mottola clearly was meant to direct this kind of a film. ""Superbad"" was a springboard for him to make something a bit more natural. ""Adventureland"" doesn't complete veer around summer romance clichés, but it has a distinctly more natural, less contrived sense of humor than ""Superbad."" It never resorts to male genital jokes, for one. Eisenberg and Stewart give very identifiable performances. They're scarily real rather than overly cliché. It's a bit tough to believe that a college graduate could be so stupid about handling girls, but his charm wins you over. A lot like Michael Cera of ""Superbad,"" Eisenberg will either win you over or irritate you. Stewart was a phenomenal choice for Emily, whose family troubles have pushed her into a romance with a married man (Ryan Reynolds). She just has the look and plays the part of a naturally beautiful girl who really wrestles with who she is. Her character is probably written best in what is in general an awesome script.Like other period comedies, ""Adventureland"" celebrates music and house parties and relishes in amusing outfit choices. Having been so bogged down with modern young adult comedy, ""Adventureland"" is really the first film since ""Dazed and Confused"" in the 90s to go back in time. Since the 80s are back in style again in many ways, the 'historical' element makes it kind of refreshing and unique despite some stylistic choices both directorially and comically that are clearly reminiscent of today's movies.This is a surprisingly good movie if you don't expect ""Superbad 2."" It's much more real and even has a bigger heart. It's about being at a crossroads and trying to make the most of a situation while figuring out exactly where you're going. In hard times like today, it's a way of looking forward positively by enjoying a re-imagining of the past.~Steven C Vist my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",Adventureland
33,Turfseer,Entertaining but flawed 80s Coming of Age Dramedy,6,26 January 2010,"Adventureland' is a coming-of-age story set in suburban Pittsburgh circa 1987. Loosely based on recollections of writer-director Greg Mottola (who's well known for directing the entertaining adolescent comedy, 'Superbad'), it is more drama than comedy. Mottola jettisons the raunchiness we've come to expect from the typical teenage fare that pops up in the cinema today for a more intellectual and informed dissection of adolescent (or shall we say post-adolescent) vagaries.The setting of Adventureland is a run down amusement park run by a goofy thirtyish couple who'll do anything to make a buck (people trying to win a prize by knocking a hat off a mannequin with a softball are unable to do so since the hats are glued to the mannequins' heads). The proprietors also save money by hiring high school and college students at minimum wage as they're unable to find a job anywhere else due to the faltering economy (Reagnomics doesn't appear to be working very well at that time). One of these young people is the film's protagonist, James Brennan, well played by Jesse Eisenberg. James was about to take a trip to Europe for the summer before going off to graduate school but after his father receives a demotion at work, his parents force him to find a job instead.Mottola does an excellent job of depicting the atmosphere at the ramshackle park. From the outset, James is advised by his co-workers to attempt to obtain a job as a ride operator as opposed to working the game booths (there is a clear cut hierarchy, and working the 'rides' is much more preferable to the booths where the workers are often forced to deal with unsavory characters who often cheat while attempting to win a prize). James also has to endure the constant blaring of 'Rock Me Amadeus', the Falco hit from the 80s, over the park's loudspeakers.What keeps Adventureland from becoming just another sitcom is the excellent interplay between the two witty friends, James and his sidekick, Joel, smartly played by the talented Martin Starr. Both these young men are bonded by their reliance on their intellect to compensate for their lack of success with the opposite sex. There are a good number of welcome literary allusions in Adventureland including discussions of such prominent authors as Dickens and Gogol.Adventureland's other characters, however, are not as strong as its two principals. For starters, Kristen Stewart's 'Em' is not convincing as the troubled recent graduate who's going out with an 'older man'. The film's scenarist attempts to explain her confusion due to the influence of a petulant stepmother who comes across as an unsympathetic stereotype. Em has few moments where she seems to like herself at all. Ryan Reynold's 'Mike Connell' could have been an interesting character as the amusement park's mechanic and married man Em is having an affair with, but he has little on screen time and comes across as being a little too sympathetic for someone who is cheating on his wife (it would have been nice if he had a bit more of an 'edge' as well as more of detailed back story).Other characters also are underdeveloped--the sexy ""Lisa P."" gets short shrift after her main claim to fame is gossiping about Mike and Em's affair, betraying the confidence she established with James. Joel's potential girlfriend is another petulant one-dimensional character who rejects him after she experiences pressure from her strict Catholic family. I did like Hader and Wiig as the amusement park owners who provide the film with its main comic relief.What I couldn't buy at all was the idea that Em would be attracted to James (along with Lisa P. who is portrayed as being able to get any guy she wants). James is simply too immature and a 'nice guy' for a woman like Em (who has just had an affair with the super-attractive, 'bad boy' mechanic) to be attracted to. So it's a real stretch when James comes to New York and Em is basically waiting for him with open arms. The old axiom 'nice guys finish last' holds true for all potential male suitors but Adventureland opts for the sentimental ending which rejects the reality of most contemporary courtship scenarios.For all its deficiencies, Adventureland still manages to entertain, with its witty dialogue and top notch performance by Jesse Eisenberg who strikes the right notes as the beleaguered post-adolescent taking his first steps toward prescient adulthood.",Adventureland
34,Chris Knipp,Coming of age in Eighties Pittsburgh,8,3 April 2009,"Greg Mottola, director of the mega-hit Apatow comedy 'Superbad,' has another, less hilarious but much more personal, go at the young American male zeitgeist in 'Adventureland,' which he both wrote and directed this time, and which focuses on a recent college graduate in Pittsburgh in the Reagon era. It's the summer of 1987 (a moment underlined with a rich, sometimes intentionally maddening song soundtrack). Young James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) has been accepted at the Columbia journalism school and looks forward to his first trip abroad with a friend. But Lady Luck messes with James. Due to an economic downturn, his dad's suffered a salary cut. His parents not only back out of paying for the Europe jaunt; they won't bankroll lodging in New York for him either. In desperation James looks for summer jobs, but finds that high SAT scores and an honors degree in comparative literature don't even qualify him for manual labor. The choice of last resort to which he falls heir is ""games"" carnie at a second-rate fairground called Adventureland where showing up sober is the only requirement. It's in this tacky world, of rotting corn dogs, barfing children, threatening contestants and bored young men and women with even more diminished expectations--his coworkers--that James must find (or salvage) love and friendship and hope for the future. And guess what? He does. And, somehow or other, much like the young hero of 'Thumbsucker,' he makes it to New York.Smart casting and witty writing as well as constant interludes of amusement park atmosphere save this from utter conventionality. Jesse Eisenberg is the cute, skinny young Jewish guy who was Jeff Daniels' hard-to-fool older son in Noah Baumbach's much celebrated 'The Squid and the Whale.' Eisenberg has done lots of things since, but this may be his biggest role so far, the one he was made to play. His James is a virgin with an East Coast Jewish sense of irony. He also has a foolish, if admirable, tendency to always tell the truth. What he's not is a horny dweeb like Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) in 'Superbad.' He's chivalrous and articulate--maybe more articulate than he needs to be to get to second base, but also enough to give the audience the feeling of a literary sensibility in play. He's not a hunk like handsome, married loser Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds), the park handyman and a would-be musician who may or may not have played one gig with Lou Reed, but he's much easier to care about. Eisenberg has the mannerisms of intelligent naivety down, and his understated rapid fire delivery is spot on. Whether or not he's meant to be Jewish, the aura of the young Jewish intellectual-to-be surrounds him. He can't describe his journalistic aims without mentioning Charles Dickens' writing about prisons.The movie, though ostensibly in coming-of-age rather than buddy-picture mode, tries a bit too hard to be gross in the contemporary Apatow manner, to be mainstream I guess, and not hard enough to avoid the standard clichés of the coming-of-age film. 'Adventureland' barely goes anywhere new. But that's not to say that Eisenberg, Kirsten Stewart (heartbreakingly wispy and alluring as James' troubled--and complex--new girlfriend, Em), and a handful of other actors aren't quite charming and watchable--or that the movie doesn't have any clever throwaway lines along with the barf and knee-in-the-balls jokes. The intellectual anchor of the piece is James's bespectacled Adventureland pal Joel (Martin Starr), a nihilistic Slavic Studies major whose idea of how to woo a lady is to give her a paperback copy of Gogol's 'Dead Souls' and explain that the author starved himself to death after writing it. Joel is so much more pessimistic, depressed, and articulate that we see James has a chance of happiness despite his innocence about courtship and increasingly uncertain future.This is a sweet comedy, and it's nice and very rare to see something from a successful Apatow alumnus that's not about a fat guy who wins the babe while remaining a pothead couch potato. Pot plays a significant role here, but James parcels out his bag judiciously and effectively. At the end while he's lost nearly everything, he's still got his dreams and his love. If that doesn't warm your heart, you're a pretty cool customer.The failings of 'Adventureland' are obvious. Aside from its lack of surprises, for all its jokes it's not particularly funny (though it also avoids turning too dark). Its amusement park setting is original, but not enough individualized. (Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig as the gung-ho park managers Bobby and Paulette do provide glimpses of comedy, though.) The unappealing, loser parents are a cliché. This isn't earth-shaking or side-splitting stuff and its a bit rough around the edges, but it's true to its (doubtless autobiographical) model, a decent and solid little film that is likely to hold its value.",Adventureland
35,BeneCumb,"Some great male performances, but still another trivial teen movie",7,2 April 2013,"1980-90ies saw the flow of teen and college movies with similar pith: nerds vs cuties, teens from rich families vs from poor families, dreams of getting laid and becoming a bigwig, partying with soft drugs etc. All the same elements are included here as well, but Adventureland was made in 2009! Well, the events date back into 1987, but still... The plot has its moments (I even giggled from time to time), but the movie is above average only thanks to good performances by Jesse Eisenberg as James Brennan, Ryan Reynolds as Mike Connell and Bill Hader as Bobby. Female characters and performances are uninviting to me, with the exception of Kristen Wiig as Paulette, but she spent too short time on the screen. The ending is predictable, but the praise could be given to witty selection of soundtrack so characteristic to that period (I had a joy of recognition).This movie could be for you if your teenage or college years were in late 1980ies, otherwise you may confine yourself to some fine acting and uneven plot.",Adventureland
36,DarkVulcan29,The Graduate meets Dazed and Confused,8,3 April 2009,"It begins in the summer of 1987, with James Brennan(Jesse Eisenberg), a college graduate, who realizes that in order to pay for his trip to New York, he must take a summer job. With so many turn downs, he finally finds a job at an amusement, simply titled Adventureland. And it seems to be the worst of the worst, cause his boss (Bill Hader) is so blissfully ignorant. And some of the employees lack any real personality, and also some what of a life. But James has only one enjoyment about the job is the beautiful named Em(Kristen Stewart), with whom he starts dating, but will he deal with the skeletons in her closet? Now I know you all might think, that because it was by the same director of SUPERBAD(2007), Greg Mottola, your expecting a raunchy sex talking vulgar comedy. Well Adventureland does not go as far as SUPERBAD did. It Kind of stops at a certain point. But all in all an entertaining coming of age comedy/drama. A lot of critics said Jesse Eisenberg was channeling Michael Cera, I have to disagree. I felt he was like channeling John Cusack from the 80's, he had that awkward charm that most girls would find appealing. Kristen Stewart is also good as Em, who proves to be sexy, just by giving a cold eye stare. Bill Hader is also good, he keeps the comedy at bay. I like the way the film kept a balance between comedy and drama. Quite an entertaining film, but not for kids.",Adventureland
37,dfranzen70,Sweet homage,7,3 December 2009,"Against the backdrop of a low-rent amusement park and set during the halcyon days of 1987, Adventureland is a sweet and endearing, if slight, comedy that makes the most of its familiar plot. In particular, Jesse Eisenberg (Zombieland) is wonderful as the nebbish James, making up for the usual pouty-faced, lip-biting acting by Kristen Stewart. A cavalcade of quirky characters makes this all seem true to life, lending a sort of easygoing charm and appeal.James is set to go to an Ivy League school, but his dad's transfer (and subsequent alcoholism) means the family can't afford the tuition. Eventually, James happens upon Adventureland, which is every bit as ritzy as its name implies, and is quickly put to work manning one of the games on the park's midway. It's here that he meets the alluring Em (Stewart), along with Joel (Martin Starr) and owners Bobby (Bill Hader) and Paulette (Kristen Wiig). Also entering the picture is the mysterious handyman Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds), who's said to have jammed with Lou Reed, and the sexotic – new word! – Lisa P (Margarita Levieva).James' problem? Many, as it turns out. He's a virgin (I know!), and Em is almost an unattainable ideal for him – she's cute (no, she's not), she's smart, she's worldly, and so on. Plus he's trying desperately to save up enough money to head to New York and start a life there. It helps, though, that he's the major weed supplier for the park's employees. Neat trick.Essentially, what you're left with is a slice of life, a look at a summer spent working in a hellhole (albeit with a cool boss like Bill Hader), accompanied by the usual teen/young adult angst and overactive hormones. I liked Jesse Eisenberg, and I think that his casting is essential to the movie's appeal. Didn't care for Stewart at all, and I wonder how she possibly gets these cute-indie-chick roles when she's neither cute nor indie. Where's this generation's Parker Posey or Janeane Garofalo? Ryan Reynolds was also appropriately douchey. It's sort of his character, his mien, his idiom, if you will.",Adventureland
38,dee.reid,"Welcome to ""Adventureland,"" where we got fun & games, plus a few things extra",9,25 August 2009,"One thing viewers will note going into ""Adventureland"" is that while the movie is billed as a comedy and has been advertised as such, there are not that many jokes here. Sure, the movie was written and directed by Greg ""Superbad"" Mottola and contains its fair share of raunchy jokes and profanity (most of which are actually funny), but at heart ""Adventureland"" is a tale of growing up, of finding true love, and learning that life does not always go according to plan and sometimes you just have to go with the flow to make things work. And somewhere in there, is also a sly social critique of the inability of American college students to find work in their chosen fields (you'll find out why later).This may turn off viewers expecting another raunchy teen comedy (like ""Superbad""), but I begin with reassurances that this movie is geared toward that same general audience. The movie has rich, identifiable, and three-dimensional characters worthy of dignity and respect. Everyone in the cast seems deserving of our sympathies because of how much they can remind us of ourselves and every crappy job we've ever had. (I'm 23. I worked as a caterer for two summers at Lockheed Martin while on break from college, and I've often wondered how many of the young women working there actually noticed me, other than being one of the workers in the kitchen whose job it was to deliver food from point ""A"" to point ""B""?) Most of comedic impresario Judd Apatow's films have had characters expressing each of these traits and while Apatow is nowhere in sight here (I was rather shocked to learn he was not involved in any way in this production), Mottola handles the jokes and characters with equal amounts of depth and respect.Set in 1987, recent college graduate James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) comes out of school expecting to go on a cross-country tour of Europe with a friend, but is mortified to discover that because of corporate down-sizing (or something similar), his parents no longer have the money to co-sponsor his trip. So he has no choice but to get a job, despite no prior work experience; furthering his mortification is the fact that even though he is a college graduate, none of the places in his suburban Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, hometown are looking forward to hiring someone of his qualifications (he can't even get a job as a manual laborer).Eventually, the only thing he can wrangle is a job as a carny at the local amusement park, the titular Adventureland. He discovers that all the games are rigged, the rides will make you hurl, and the place is run by a flaky married couple - Bobby (Bill Hader) and Paulette (Kristen Wiig). James gradually makes friends with some of the unusual - but quirky and lively - fellow employees, but becomes smitten with Em (Kristen Stewart, of ""Twilight"" fame), who is in fact, a lot more intelligent, mature, and grown-up than she appears.Let me just say that ""Adventureland"" is so far the best-acted comedy I've seen this year, and the most surprising. Kristen Stewart, hot off her ""Twilight"" success (and no, I haven't seen the movie yet, nor am I sure I really want to), turns out to be the film's most surprising asset. Like I said earlier, she appears to be much smarter than she appears, so she's not just another pretty young face who's here in your typical girlfriend role. It turns out that like James and everyone else at Adventureland, she's stuck in a dead-end existence at this flaky amusement park. Additionally, while she returns James's affections, it becomes clear that she's hiding a rather disturbing secret from him (a secret that is made crystal-clear to us fairly early in the picture and is something that she does learn to regret when it endangers her relationship with James).The scenes between James and Em are what this movie has the best to offer in terms of characters and dialogue. What's most interesting about their scenes is that like the characters, the dialogue in their scenes seems fresh and alive, like two people who are really in the midst of a developing relationship, and their lines don't (normally) consist of just four-letter words and one- or two-word sentences. Their dialogue just sounds real and down-to-earth.Other characters are just as interesting, especially Connell (Ryan Reynolds, in what is his most tolerable performance, in my opinion), a local wannabe rock god known for cheating on his wife. One of James's friends has a disturbing habit of punching him in the private parts every time he sees him. Even the park's flaky owners come to be rather three-dimensional and sympathetic, and somewhat deserving of that sympathy. Apparently, the reason they like to cheat customers is because of not-fully-unstated financial woes; those Giant Ass Pandas are in short supply, apparently, in such a short supply, in fact, that if anybody wins one on someone's watch, that certain someone's going home with a pink slip. Another surprising revelation is the mysterious ""hot-girl"" of the group, Lisa P (Margarita Levieva), a wannabe dancer known for showing off her moves occasionally when the right music is playing. She's interested in James, which of course threatens his budding romance with Em.""Adventureland"" may not be the greatest film of the year so far (but the '80s soundtrack just rocks), but believe me it's one ride you'll want to take again and again.9/10",Adventureland
39,meeza,Could have used more comedic adventure,7,7 November 2009,"If you are quenching for a superb entertainment movie adventure, do not look into the comedy ""Adventureland"". Hey, maybe I have never been to any real movie critic adventures in being just an amateur pun film critic, but I cannot fathom why so many critics gave this movie such high marks. Writer-Director Greg Mottola's ""coming of age"" tale stars the always fast-talking nervy Jesse Eisenberg as James Brennan, a recent Pittsburgh college graduate who takes a summer job in an amusement park called (hence the title) in order to gather enough money to move to New York and eventually go for his Masters Degree in Columbia. But eventually it behooves James how much he learns about relationships, friendship, trust, and deceit in his summer amusement gig; some of this amused Brennan and some did not. At the beginning of his summer ride experience, James has his eyes on the beautiful Em, played by Kristen Stewart. Em, like James, is a ""games carny"" who Brennan craves to have some bedroom games with. He falls for her the instant they meet. Em eventually falls for James' innocent & humble ways but wants to take it slow with him, maybe due to the fact that she is riding the bedroom Himalaya with the married amusement park ""fix it"" handyman Mike Connell played by Ryan Reynolds (which in real life has the luxury of riding the supreme Himalaya every night in that luscious existence called Scarlett Johannson.; sorry Ryan). James also befriends a daydreaming, easygoing carny colleague named Joel, (Joels can be very amusing, lol). Joel is James carny history man by updating young Brennan on the eccentric history of the Adventureland park. The managing couple of the Adventureland park are the cooky couple Bobby & Paulette played by the SNL present legends Bill Hader & Kristen Wiig. But the central narrative ride of the movie ""Adventureland"" focuses on James' roller-coaster experiences he had during that Summer of 87. Motolla did round up some very authentic dialogue scenes between James and the film's other characters. But Motolla's linear plot line development did not fall into an enticing synchronic mode. There were many overextended scenes in ""Adventureland"" that made me shout to the screen ""do you want to go faster!!"" Motolla's semi-sweet screenplay was more worth the ride than his direction. Eisenberg was mediocre at best, because we have seen this Jesse Boy play the same character archetype over and over again. The rest of the cast seemed like they were having more of an amusing time then actually acting in their thespian ""Adventureland"" experience. However, I do have to acknowledge Martin Starr's laudable effort as the mild-mannered Joel. His character resembled mostly of a prototype young carny. But the real star of the film was not even Martin, it was the music. The film is set in 1987 so I do have to give props for Motolla for the 80's music inserted in many of the film's scenes which did enhance the film's authenticity. But not even those legendary tunes were enough for me to greatly recommend the ""Adventureland"" movie roller-coaster. *** Average",Adventureland
40,st-shot,Adventureland pretty tame and dull,5,6 April 2009,"This coming of age film attempts to have it both ways as a frat comedy and a light drama on young adult angst but in doing so dilutes itself like watered down kool aid. Writer and director Greg Motolla who did a similar and better balancing job with Super Bad is all thumbs with this cliché ridden bore that takes itself too seriously while neglecting the bread and butter comedy aspect. Adventureland humor chugs along with a repetitive array of groin kicks and punches, puking and erection humor but makes the grave mistake of mixing a sensitive and syrupy romance in equal parts into the batter. The result is one bad corn dog.James Brennan is all psyched to head off to the Big Apple for grad school at Columbia when his father has an employment setback, forcing James to take a job as a game concessioner at a Pittsburgh amusement park. Adventureland is little more than a run down traveling carny act being held together by chewing gum and rigged games. There's a seedy charm to the owners who do little supervision of the rag tag summer help comprised of pranksters and youthful dreamers who seem to spend more time getting stoned and playing arcade games than doing actual work. James meets and innocently begins to date fellow park worker Em who has a lousy home life and is in a bad relationship with the married park mechanic. Problems ensue between the two before the mawkish Western Union denouement but they seem small in comparison to the flaccid dialog and torpid energy that never gets out of first gear.Jesse Eisenberg as Jimmy stands around with a mystified expression most of the time while Kristin Stewart as Em displays a heroin chic mope and little else. The parents are predictably either uncaring, clueless, alcoholic or two out of three. The teens are predictably whacked, introspective or materialist and sex obsessed. What else is new? There's a subtle amount of Christian bashing but that's been around for awhile as well.By attempting to give equal weight to serious romance in an Animal House milieu Adventureland limply flounders about from start to finish. It's too much tunnel of love and not enough fun house.",Adventureland
41,Fluke_Skywalker,"Like Gen X, it's not as deep as it thinks it is",5,5 February 2014,"On the surface, 'Adventureland' may look like a nostalgia piece, but there's no love for the era apparent here. If anything it subtly condemns the 80s while using its zeitgeist to fuel what is ultimately a rather shallow, go nowhere dramedy that we've seen a thousand times before; And often much better.The cast is blandly appealing and 80s kids will likely find some nuggets of retro joy despite the film's best efforts to eschew nostalgia, but there are few things more annoying than a film that thinks that it's much more profound than it actually is.In the end, 'Adventureland' isn't worth the price of admission.",Adventureland
42,cekadah,can't go with it,4,16 December 2012,"first i found the 'teenage' characters way too adult in their emotional development for their age and background. and one of them (the little guy) is so immature he absolutely doesn't fit in with the other teens. yet they are all friends! problems all around for me to accept these characters as 'real'.i found the plot line a little disjointed as the topic was our lead character having to get a job for college money - forget the trip that starts the story. we seldom see any of the teens working and they have a very active night life.then the maintenance guy is out to get every sexual pleasure he can. and he could pass as some of the teens father. this movie is a mess!actually the only reason i watched it was for the lead character who's movie career has grown since this movie was produced. if you want to see an excellent 'like' story watch ""middle of nowhere"" - it's far more complete and watchable than 'adventureland'.",Adventureland

I'd been hearing buzz about this movie for ages, I guess its considered some kind of cult classic but I didn't really ""get"" it. It's a sweet coming of age/summer love movie, following a recent college grad who is forced to take a crappy minimum wage job at the local amusement park after his parents announce they can no longer fund his education or send him to Europe. The plot is simple, there are some humorous moments carried along by good performances from Eisenberg and Stewart and a fun sub-cast. I think my favorite part was probably the nostalgia inducing 80's music, the Pinto that Stewart's character drove. Ryan Reynolds is that bad boy we all remember so well... 8/25/14",Adventureland
44,jfgibson73,Things don't always work out the way we plan,7,29 August 2009,"I really liked this movie. You have to be willing to believe that the two hottest girls in the area are both interested in the shy, awkward geek that is the main character, but other than that, the movie is done in a fairly realistic way.I liked the casting a lot. Ryan Reynolds, possibly the biggest star of the ensemble, dialed it way down for a nicely understated performance. Kristen Stewart, who has been on 100,000 magazine covers in the last year, creates a character that any college guy would want to hang out with. Bill Hader does his usual wack-job thing as the authority figure, and numerous unknowns play peripheral supporting roles that work fine too. The only person that really didn't get used well was Kristin Wiig--she actually had less to do here than in Knocked Up. You must really have to try to keep KW from having a single memorable quote.It is a love story supposedly set in the 80's, but other than the music, this could have been 2009 (was Lou Reed really that big a deal in 1987?) I think setting the movie in this time period might have just been an excuse to get the Replacements on the soundtrack. They needn't have bothered getting specific with the year--The 'Mats are good anytime you roll them out! The sense of humor in this movie is similar to a Wes Anderson movie--I think of Rushmore more than anything else. It doesn't have jokes in the setup/payoff type of sequence, nor do I think I actually laughed out loud once. It goes more for subtle irony, and also has some fairly poignant moments, even gaining sympathy for characters you don't think you will like.Overall, I was totally drawn in to this story and couldn't stop watching until the end. Sweet and memorable.",Adventureland
45,EUyeshima,A Nostalgic Look at the Eighties in a Meandering Coming-of-Age Romance,6,23 October 2009,"I worked in food service at Marriott's Great America theme park when I was just out of high school, so I can well imagine how the young protagonist of director/screenwriter Greg Mottola's 2009 coming-of-age dramedy must have felt when he was relegated to an inelegant amusement park after his hopes for a European summer are dashed by his father's demotion at work. Granted my experience was a few years earlier than this story's setting, the Reagan era of 1987, as James Brennan, having just graduated from Oberlin College, prepares to enter Columbia's graduate school of journalism in the fall. Unenthusiastically manning the park's horse-race booth, James finds a friend in Joel, a sympathetic cynic, but more importantly, becomes drawn to sad-eyed Em Lewin.Sharing a predilection for marijuana and moody rock, James and Em embark on a romance, but she is already caught in a doomed relationship with Mike Connell, an older, married ride maintenance man who moonlights as a rock musician. Mottola wrote and directed ""Superbad"", so he knows how to extract laughs from the foibles of youthful indiscretion. This time, however, he favors the human drama over the comedy, and the result meanders into a few too many subplots to sustain genuine interest in the two principals. Playing a far more sympathetic version of the teen he played in Noah Baumbach's ""The Squid and the Whale"". Jesse Eisenberg makes us care about James' fate even though the actor seems to be working off the same geek mojo as Michael Cera. Currently flying high as Bella Swan in ""Twilight"", Kristen Stewart brings the same sullen quality she displayed in that movie and as Meg Ryan's daughter in ""In the Land of Women"" to her portrayal of Em. The two actors banter in much the same way that Cera and Kat Dennings did in ""Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist"".Playing the polar opposite of the put-upon assistant in ""The Proposal"", Ryan Reynolds lends surprising depth to Connell even as his character's pathetic nature reveals itself, as does Martin Starr (""Knocked Up"") as sardonic nonconformist Joel. Saturday Night Live's Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig have a few funny moments playing the eccentric husband-and-wife park managers. Between the golden-hued cinematography by Terry Stacey and the period soundtrack, which is full of period hits like Hüsker Dü's ""Don't Want to Know If You're Lonely"" and Falco's ""Rock Me Amadeus"", the 1980's are captured most faithfully here. The 2009 DVD has a standard set of extras - a clever commentary track from Mottola and Eisenberg, three brief deleted scenes with optional commentary, and a standard making-of featurette.",Adventureland
46,Jonny_Numb,The Abusement Park,7,19 April 2009,"In terms of structure and tone, ""Adventureland"" is a trip down the sort of coming-of-age territory that John Hughes mapped out so well back in the 1980s (""The Breakfast Club"" being maybe the penultimate portrait of teenage disenfranchisement). What's surprising--and ultimately rewarding--about the whole experience is how unpredictable it all is. In a time where financially successful comedies are reduced to saccharine formula, seeing something that is as interested in the arcs of its (surprisingly complex) characters as it as a good 'punch-to-the-balls' joke is downright refreshing. James (Jesse Eisenberg) is a recent college grad anticipating a summer in Europe before returning to grad school (he's already been accepted at Columbia) in the fall; things don't go according to plan when Dad (Jack Gilpin) is demoted at his job, and his resulting fate is a summer stint at the cruddy titular theme park, populated by a gaggle of loners, social misfits, and other curiosities (that it's set in 1987 by default aligns it with the late-'80s trend of screwball, youth-targeted comedies in amusement parks and summer camps). Writer-director Greg Mottola also gave us ""Superbad"" (which I haven't seen), and while ""Adventureland"" is prone to spurts of easy punchlines (urination, boners, and ever-reliable marijuana gags), its best laughs come from the development of its characters--like ""Juno,"" we begin with a gang of familiar types who gradually work themselves inside-out, becoming fleshed-out figures we can actually relate to. That Mottola only intermittently shades in his characters is a testament to the film's unpredictability--just when we think we know where it's headed, ""Adventureland"" pushes us in an altogether different direction, running us through the pain, laughter, and desperation of young-adulthood. Filmed nostalgia has seldom been this bittersweet.",Adventureland
47,valadas,Teenagers are not so bad after all,7,11 September 2012,"Adventureland is an amusement park and it's also a world where anything may happen and where many different people can meet and perform different actions and have different reactions and where funny things, sad things and adventurous things can happen. James is a boy that has just graduated from high school and whose dream is to go to university in New York City after a trip to Europe. For that he must avail himself of the summer holidays to earn the necessary money for the trip and stay by working at the park like assistant at a games sideshow. Of course we can see that alcohol, weed smoking, sex, profanity and discotheques take an important part on these young people lives but this movie shows also that teen agers are also capable of good and pure sentiments such as true love, friendship, loyalty and comradeship. James falls in love with a co-worker who is also having an adulterous intercourse with a married man from before they have met. James is a boy who shows a certain insecurity and indecision in terms of sentiments and feelings and that brings him a few troubles. All the young actors and actresses do a good job and create excellent and realistic teenagers types. It's not a very deep movie but a good to be seen one.",Adventureland
48,punishmentpark,"""Can you stop saying intercourse?""",7,27 July 2015,"'Adventureland', also in the sense that adolescence may be a romantic, adventurous ride with as many ups as it has downs - as is the case for our protagonist in this movie.In the first part I had a little trouble getting into things, because of Jesse Eisenberg's overly off-beat delivery (and his equally forced clever lines) and the settings, atmosphere and overall look of the film weren't very convincingly '80s-like. But Eisenberg's performance got better and better (and his lines more natural), as did that whole '80s atmosphere - much helped by the steady, and not too fast, developing of the story, with some good humorous bits here and there.There are lots of fun supporting roles by - for instance - Martin Starr, Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, and the soundtrack is a sheer endless list of terrific oldies, like 'Breaking the law' (Judas Priest) and 'Don't wanna know if you are lonely' (Hüsker Dü) So, in conclusion, this is not an earth-shattering coming of age flick, but certainly more than fun enough to have seen twice so far. Plus: Kristen Stewart is not the best actress ever, but her natural cuteness is simply undeniable.A big 7 out of 10.",Adventureland
49,oneguyrambling,A teen movie that doesn't make teens look like idiots.,7,5 November 2010,"This was NUTHIN! like I expected going in - but that is a good thing. For some reason I had this as a Superbad crossed with American Pie in my mind, only I expected it to be far more Pie influenced, which is why I waited this long to watch it.Not only is Adventureland set in the late 80s, I felt that it was heavily influenced by the films of the era, with only a (slightly) hipper John Hughes feel at times. This refreshingly means that there are precious few vomit jokes or body fluid gags. Sure bodily fluids are exchanged and people vomit, but unlike hundreds of films in recent years this isn't the joke.Set in 87, we meet James as he is being unceremoniously by his short term girlfriend as the end of the school year comes. Thereafter he finds that due to a change in his Dad's employment status he can no longer afford his end of year trip to Europe, and worse his college aspirations are hurt by the financial difficulty.Soooooo, James looks for a summer job and without too much delay finds out that the local amusement park Adventureland is the only place that will hire him. As mentioned above there are no ""look how funny these situations are!"" montages featuring quirky employers and sh*tty jobs. There is one guy who says ""we'll get back to you"" and then James announcing to his parents that Adventureland is the only place that will have him. In this Deuce Bigalow age this is refreshing.In the initial handing over of the park rules James is told that no-one gets anything for free, no-one wins the big prizes and is then shown how everything is rigged, and here is me thinking that carnival folk are all honest as the day is long! An aside here: Kristin Wiig plays the wife of the park manager (Bill Heder), her under her breath comments after the end of the previous character's comments was amusing in Knocked Up and Saturday Night Live. Kristin, it's done. Please stop. If you don't have anything else to do go home and count your money.The downside of having a smart plot and a fairly intelligent and realistic cast is that the dialogue here isn't always true to label. This means that instead of bum and d*ck jokes we have witty and insightful comments that sound a bit foreign coming from spotty teens, even though because this is a movie there are no spotty teens. I don't mind one character quoting famous authors or Latin, but when it seems that everyone is doing it it just seems a little strange.But I digress, the main characters in Adventureland are James, a Michael Cera clone, (though I think not by choice), and Em the lurrrve interest, both are minimally played without any histrionics or theatrics, again this is a good thing. To spice things up there is the resident hottie chick who every guy covets in Lisa P, and the older cool maintenance guy Connell. Now Connell is played by Ryan Reynolds, who I detest, although this is how memorable I found him, I actually thought he was Dane Cook through the whole movie until the credits rolled and there he was.I still hate Dane Cook too by the way.Most of the staff are in their teens, which is fine but they are always in pubs, drinking and smoking, not that I am prudish, it's just that I'm sure the legal age is 21 in the US and they never seem to hide anything.To sum up Adventureland is a teen movie unlike many teen movies made for a while, there is no cheesy moments, it is slow and deliberately paced and everyone in it thinks about what they say before they say or do it.Strangely enough even though I would rather watch this a million times than sit through American Pie or Road trip once, I think the level of the dialogue is more accurate in those crappy films, as in my experience being a teen and since then dealing with them, they rarely discuss Melville or underrated Russian authors.Now I think I have suggested that this is not an ""event"" film, so there isn't much in the way of major plot developments aside from relationship and family issues, which are more easy to appreciate if they aren't listed here.I'm sure that the primary issue faced by the filmmakers and bean counters is that with the target market being teens, would they embrace a clever and intelligent film without explosions and tits? In looking for the answer to my query I found out that the director of Adventureland also made Superbad, so I like the way he is heading with his career. Hopefully from here he doesn't take the Nicholas Cage Con Air route in future years chasing the easy cash.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Intelligent, well paced and dare I say it sweet? I am a long way from my teens but in my old eyes this is what a good teen movie looks like.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",Adventureland
50,Sirus_the_Virus,It's great.,9,6 October 2009,"Superbad director Greg Mattola returns once again with Adventureland. A film that I liked more than Superbad. There is a lot of surprise going on in this film. The movie,if you've seen the trailer, is not what you expect. It's a surprise... a pleasant surprise.Newcomer Jessie Eisenberg(Who looks a lot like Michael Cera) stars as James Brennan, a teen who's plans on college are shunned down. So he gets a Summer job at Adventureland amusement parks, where he meets Em(Kristen Stewart) and has the best Summer of his life. If you're expecting Superbad, don't come here. This isn't a sex comedy like that. This film is funny, heartfelt, and at times dramatic. The laughs don't come from Jessie Eisenberg or Kristen Stewart or even Ryan Reynolds who has been on fire this year. The main laughs come from Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, who star as the owners of the park.You really should expect the unexpected when it comes to Adventureland.

51,bobsgrock,Signs of progression in the teen/young adult genre.,9,19 July 2010,"Typical of Hollywood for the past 25 years or so, for every three or four terrible, cliché-ridden movies depicting the lives of young people in America, there is one really great film like Adventureland. Written and directed by Greg Mottola, who so seamlessly made Superbad an enjoyable and insightful look into the mind and desires of high-school boys and their relations with women, this story follows the same type of boys four years until college is over and the real world must begin. Unfortunately for James Brennan, the real world must begin much sooner and harsher than expected.With little money and no way to escape to Europe for the summer, James is forced to take a crappy job at the local amusement park near his house. Of course, it turns out to be way better than expected, but he also meets people and is introduced to ideas that he couldn't have expected to change his foreseeable future. The most important one is Em, a young girl with many troubles at home and using her low-paying job as an escape from the pressures of changes in her life. Indeed, most of these young employees do the same thing; the promises of drugs, alcohol and sex seem to be the right way to go but never fulfill completely.The film sidesteps many of the teen movie clichés, filling the narrative with smart and neurotic characters rather than dumb and manic. These are people you care about because they try to do what they feel is right while knowing deep down it isn't. The acting is also very good across the board, with each actor giving their own self-loathing and awkward tendencies to show how the feelings never really leave no matter what age. Jesse Eisenberg is flawless as the smart, nervous and dry guy who is still quite nice and manages to use his charm to overcome his lack in other areas. Kristen Stewart proves once again that she is coming into her own as a great actress and outside of the Twilight movies she will fulfill that destiny. Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig are hilarious as the pseudo-parent employers and Ryan Reynolds gives his darkest performance yet as a married man with some younger habits.Much of the credit still must go to Mottola, who has such a knack for showing the awkward moments and balancing them with the sweet and tender. The final sequence stretches on a bit longer than it probably should but small quibbles aside, this is a near-flawlessly written, directed and acted film showing how fun and educational work can be if you find the right job, or even if you don't.",Adventureland
52,vithiet,"A bit hyped in my opinion, but still entertaining.",7,25 July 2021,"Considering the ratings and reviews I was expecting something way above the usual teen rom-com, so I was a bit disappointed because while it's failry funny and entertaining, it's on par with most movies in that genre. There is nothing extremely original here, most jokes are good and some fall a little flat, and it's your basic teen relationship fare. Another negative point for me: Kristen Stewart is a terrible actress regardless of what she's in.",Adventureland
53,jaredmobarak,"James—am I pronouncing that right, James?  Adventureland",8,9 April 2009,"Superbad was written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, lending it more of a raunchiness and absurdity, basing itself in a heightened high school reality, while Adventureland marks Mottola's sophomore effort as writer. It is completely relatable, mirroring the audience's experiences post college/high school, looking for the cash to go away for school. Each character is written so fully that even the periphery roles come off the screen as three-dimensional. The film may be about James Brennan and his quest to go to Columbia in the fall, but it is also a time capsule of the 80s and what it means to be on the cusp of adulthood.Everyone is a child, at varying degrees of maturity—and age plays no factor in this statement. The biggest kids, to me, are actually Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig's Bobby and Paulette. They run the titular amusement park with a penchant for fun, safety, and litter-free pavement. Depending on circumstances, Hader can go from serious conversation about the books and numbers to a crazed, bat-wielding bouncer protecting his employees without threat of recourse. This is his park and he knows the score—what the kids want, what the games should give them, and what immature punks need to be shown in order to behave. Hader is slowly becoming one of the best supporting comics in the business, I just hope he doesn't get offered a mediocre starring vehicle with bad writing to ""launch"" his career further, he deserves better. Both he and Wiig show their love for each other as well as the park constantly, uncaring about how juvenile they may appear at times. They take it to 10 at every step.In order for a film like this to work, you need a reason for these kids to be working at a dead-end job for the summer. My one complaint about the film is the fact that Mottola relies on financial status to explain it. Jesse Eisenberg's James must work there because he has had a golden spoon his whole life and now sees it disappear as his father gets transferred to a lower paying job; Kristen Stewart's Em works there to fight against the money and status her lawyer father has given her and her mother-in-law lives for; and the others in this ragtag bunch of minimum-wagers are there either because they enjoy it, their families don't have the money to keep them from it, or their dreams have been postponed to stay close to home and help out. I guess money isn't the worst thing he could use to get them all together, this is the 80s after all, it's just a bit contrived that you have two guys heavily influenced in literature, (one who reads Shakespeare for fun sometimes and another majoring in Russian with a love for Gogol), working together at a crappy job.The worst culprits on the scale of immaturity are the parents of the park employees. Never taking into consideration their children, each either ignore their kids, become oblivious to their actions, worry about their own finances instead of living up to promises, let their son take the fall for a bottle of alcohol in the car, of just plain not care at all. None of these ""adults"" have any redeeming qualities; they have ruined their lives and are all on track to ruin that of their offspring. Adventureland becomes a haven for all the kids to be themselves and experience more of a parental influence from boss Bobby then at home. It is a decade of greed and none are safe from it. While the adults pursue money, the kids pursue sex and drugs.Mottola could have just made this film into the antics at an amusement park. While there are definitely instances of that, especially when the employees are drunk or high, he never cops-out from telling his coming of age story. For every moment of park games cheating, gluing googly eyes to plush bananas, or fights with the locals there are three plus instances of poignancy, whether they be joy or heartbreak, both common emotions for all twentysomethings. Love is on display at every turn in all its complicated glory. With lovelorn, sheltered guys like James; awkward intellectuals like Martin Starr's Joel; virgin teases in dance-fanatic Margarita Levieva's Lisa P; Stewart's young woman in desperate need for attention and affection; and Ryan Reynolds' marriage-trapped lothario, pain becomes a common factor. Feelings are trampled upon, ignored, and bolstered, mistakes are made and either regretted or redeemed. We all act like juveniles at times, wanting to be the center of attention, but with that comes those moments where we come together and stand up for those we care about.The film itself is well shot and constructed, including many sequences of pure visual joy such as an extended bumper car scene. Complete with a stellar 80s soundtrack, (I could have done with less ""Rock Me Amadeus""), Adventureland encapsulates a feeling of nostalgia for a time we all leave behind us once our careers begin. Some live out the dream and some hold on for too long knowing it will never come to fruition. This fact isn't expressed more than with the relationship between Reynolds' Connell and Eisenberg's James. The two are on opposite paths, one constantly looking to the past for a love he can't have in his marriage and the other looking towards the future for a world of complete happiness. They cross paths often, Stewart's troubled and confused love interest in the middle, but rather than exploit the dynamic for over-the-top fireworks and violence, Mottola keeps both in character. By acknowledging who they are and what they stand for, the final confrontation between them could not have been more appropriate. Eisenberg is proving his worth as a deserving actor in Hollywood and Reynolds shows once more how nuanced and good he can be.",Adventureland
54,Karl Self,Supercheesy but also sweet,7,28 January 2013,"Coming of age in a luna park. An ambitious high-school grad has to earn college money to study journalism at Columbia, so he has to take a summer job at ""Adventureland, Pittsburg PA"", a brummagen (look it up) amusement park where he has to mix with the local dropouts and eventually (and inevitably) finds true love and the meaning of life! It's as cheesy as that, folks, but with a brilliant script (if not plot), direction and acting, I quickly gave in to the film's charm and consented to be lulled into a world where the anti-hero is nerdy, but in a really cool way, where attractive girls can be world-weary (in an attractive way), and where teenage angst is finally taken seriously. That's movie magic, I guess. The plot doesn't have to be plausible or realistic, and it can be clichéd from here to Hanoi, as long as the movie is good enough to make us want to believe it.Which is what this movie does.",Adventureland

Not something I care for in a movie.Kristen Stewart is near perfect and her magnetism is much greater than in TWILIGHT where she was involved with the effeminate vampire, BUT.. but what would this girl want with the idiot geek in this movie? Oh, I get it: the script says so.Thumbs down to any movie where they say, ""Jesus f...ing Christ"" but double thumbs down when a Jew says it. Jews are always bellyaching about their Holocaust, but do they ever consider not trash-mouthing Christians? Apparently not.The other negative is the rude pro-liberal dialog liberally peppered throughout the script.Incidentally, I was once a carnival worker. Pay was low, hours long, breaks few.

56,fwomp,Not So Much A Comedy As It Is A Bittersweet Romance,8,1 May 2010,"ADVENTURELAND will be enjoyed by those who go in with either no knowledge of the story, or those that thought it might be a comedy but quickly come to understand that it's much more than that.More of a quirky summer romance than a laugh-out-loud comedy, Adventureland gets some surprisingly high marks for taking a tried and true genre and marketing it to young adults — as well as those of us with a touch of gray — who remember working the odd job in order to make money for school, and finding much more than just an income.Director Greg Mottola springs into action again after his wildly successful teen comedy SUPERBAD. Mottola proved his comedic talent in that flick, but here in Adventureland pulls back and gives us more of a bittersweet love story with a comedic shell.For those of you who saw (and loved) ZOMBIELAND, you'll definitely want to see Jesse Eisenberg in this film. Although he's not running for his life from brain-starved zombies, he is running toward a life as a man, trying to figure out where he's going and how he wants his life to pan out.Kristen Stewart (INTO THE WILD) plays the love interest. She's the perfect confused and embittered daughter of a recently remarried father and ""evil"" stepmother. Finding solace in the sexual declivities of a married maintenance man, Arlene (Stewart) sees a kind spirit in James (Eisenberg), and the two form a budding romance that rocks, shatters, and builds as they discover what each has to offer the other.The entire film circles around James' need to earn some cash for college after his parents' finances fall apart. He finds the only job offered to him at an amusement park named, yep, Adventureland. It is run by Bobby (comedic superstar Bill Hader, TROPIC THUNDER) and his wife Paulette (Kristen Wiig, KNOCKED UP). This park and it's workers are what makes for an interesting and occasionally funny mix. Bobby guides Adventureland with a quirky yet firm hand. The crew that helps run the park are as diverse as America itself, and often just as screwed up. One of them has been a long-time friend of James' and loves punching him in the groin. Another (known only as Lisa P) is the sexually desirable yet unknown virginal girl that all the guys lust after. And still another is an obviously mentally challenged security guard who is the knowledge-base about everyone and everything that goes on within (and around) the park.As you can see, there's a lot going on, and not all of it is funny. In fact, if you go into the film thinking it's going to be SUPERBAD 2, prepare to be disappointed. Unfortunately, many of the previews gave that impression. Although there's comedy lightly (very lightly) sprinkled throughout, it's not what makes this movie go. It is post-teen angst and a surprisingly great love story that allows many of us a walk down memory lane.",Adventureland
57,KnightsofNi11,Unfunny teen drama that I've seen a thousand times,3,17 July 2010,"Adventureland is a story set in the summer of 1987 and it centers around a group of teens working at a theme park called Adventureland. Let me start off by saying that this film was horribly marketed. Anyone who saw the trailers would obviously expect another fun and raunchy comedy, especially when it comes from the likes of Greg Mottola (Superbad). Unfortunately this assumption is dead wrong. After a humorous set-up that introduces the stories protagonist, James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) the ""fun"" begins when James gets a job at Adventureland. The 1980s theme park should have been a hilarious backdrop for a story, but sadly it was not. As character relationships spark amongst the employees of Adventureland, the film becomes another silly teenage romance/drama.James quickly falls for the lively and exciting Em (Kristen Stewart). They become friends and start hanging out regularly. James eventually decides that Em is the perfect girl and he wants to spend every waking moment with her. And so ensues a collection of awkward and annoying conversations between the socially awkward and uninteresting Jesse Eisenberg and bland and lifeless Kristen Stewart. The plot unfolds with very predictable occurrences and absolutely nothing interesting happens that we haven't all seen before in a hundred other Hollywood creations.I said earlier that the theme park should have been a hilarious backdrop for the story and as the plot progresses it becomes nothing more than that, a backdrop. The setting is not meaningful at all and the only purpose it serves is collecting these annoying teenage kids who have nothing better to do than smoke weed and have sex. As I began to realize that this was not the comedy it was marketed to be, I quickly lost interest when I realized I had seen this movie before, only last time it had good jokes. Adventureland was a major letdown.",Adventureland
58,cultfilmfan,Adventureland,10,8 April 2009,"Adventureland takes place in the late 1980's and is about a recent high school graduate named James Brennan, who in a year, or so, hopes to go to New York City with a friend of his to live and go to school to study journalism. When some financing for some of Jesse's plans hits a snag, he soon realizes that he needs to make money and to do this he accepts the only job he can get, which is at a theme park called Adventureland, where he runs some of the games there. While working at the theme park Jesse soon becomes friends with some of the other teenagers there and also becomes fascinated and even starts to bond and form a relationship with a young woman named Em. This is going to be a summer that Jesse will not forget because of the people who he meets and the lessons and memories that will stay with him long after the summer. Despite some of the advertisements for this film billing it as a comedy it is really more of a drama. Yes, it does have some laugh out loud moments in it, but it really does fall more into the drama category. Also this is a film more for older teens, or young adults and it is definitely more mature and heartfelt and with more social commentary than one would probably think. The film shows the awkwardness of being a young adult/teenager and finding your way in the world as well as handling true love. The film also showcases how difficult adolescence can be with a lot of issues coming up that are probably what most young adults have gone through, or at least know people who have gone through similar situations. There are moments when the film can be quite sad as we see the different characters hurting because of poor decisions they have made and also living up to those mistakes as well as having to adjust and deal with things not at all in their control. We see how a lot of the times at work and in front of friends that these characters put on fronts, but really deep down they are hurting and looking for love and acceptance wherever they can find it (which results in an interesting subplot of the film). And as I mentioned there are a lot of funny scenes that come around as a result of some of the teenage awkwardness and they can be quite funny, but over all this is a more thought provoking and more of a message film than your average teen fare. I think most young adults, or people who still remember their teens and growing up will find a lot in common with this movie and appreciate the different character studies as well as the music scene and the whole ""fitting in"" part that goes along with being a teenager. I liked how this film felt so genuine and really did feel like I was watching real teenage characters and not some drunken sex crazed fraternity brothers that we see in so many other films. I also appreciated the low key humour that is more subtle and not really in your face and the non flashy, or technical direction that helps the film feel realistic without being commercial, or unrealistic by making it more crude, or taking away some of the top notch dialogue, or believable settings and characters. I thought quite a bit about this film after I came away from it and I appreciated it even more days after I saw it. I think that those looking for a more rowdy sexual teen comedy should look elsewhere, but for a more realistic and human approach to everyday teen issues and for older viewers to remember some of that 80's nostalgia, or your own youth than this is definitely one to see. One of the best films of this year, so far.",Adventureland
59,agmoldham,A pleasant Rom Com for the younger audience,5,11 November 2009,I was pleasantly surprised about Aventureland. Coming from the same team that gave us Superbas I was expecting a teen sex comedy. This is altogether more subtle and gentle though. It follows the story of James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) who is struggling to raise the money to go to college and goes to work at a theme park (Adventureland) to raise the funds. He falls for a fellow worker Em (Kristen Stewart) and the film follows the ups and downs of their relationship.The 2 leads play fine roles and I look forward to seeing them again in the future. Ryan Reynolds also plays a good supporting role and we're set to see more of him over th next few years as well. The film was nicely played throughout and it's nice to have an intelligent rom com for a change.,Adventureland
60,ajs-10,Not what I was expecting!... A pleasant surprise!,8,22 August 2010,"I hadn't really heard a lot about this film before it came up on TV this week. I have a vague recollection of it being mentioned when Zombieland came out, also last year and also starring Jesse Eisenberg. So I didn't really have very high hopes when I hit play on my Sky+ box. Boy was I in for a very pleasant surprise! But more of that later, I'll give you a quick low-down on the plot first.It's Pittsburgh in the summer of 1987 and grad student, James Brennan, finds himself having to get a job if he's to further his education. He tries several places, but finds he is turned down a lot. His last resort is to go and work with his childhood friend, Frigo, at a fun park called Adventureland. The park is run by a couple, Bobby and Paulette, who give him the job straight away. James soon makes a bunch of new friends, Joel, Sue O'Malley, Mark, Lisa P., and the park's repairs technician Mike Connell, who is a part-time musician and claims to have once jammed with Lou Reed. But the person who has the biggest impact on James is Em Lewin. In fact the relationship between these two people takes up most of the film and when it ends in Oh no, I'll let you find out for yourself, assuming you haven't seen it already.I found this a really engaging film to watch, I could identify with all of the characters and, although the plot is quite complicated at times, it was easy enough to follow. A really great soundtrack provided a great backdrop for the story with songs of the day bringing back memories of what my life was like back then. Great performances all round, but especially from Kristen Stewart as Em and Jesse Eisenberg as James. I thought they both played their parts perfectly. I must also mention Martin Starr as Joel, Margarita Levieva as Lisa P., Bill Hader as Bobby, Kristen Wiig as Paulette and not forgetting Ryan Reynolds as Mark Connell.Over all a really engaging story about growing up and facing up to the problems you make for yourself. Some great performances and a really good soundtrack lift this movie above others that have tried to tackle the subject. Probably because of the honesty shown in the dialogue and the delivery of the actors. I feel it's one that will stay with me for quite a while. Highly recommended.My score: 7.9/10",Adventureland
61,jpschapira,"Pure, genuine magic",8,5 June 2009,"Inexplicably, some films appear to the viewer as intensely charged with personal feelings. I use the word 'inexplicably' because there may be general dispositions of the movie that help this notion, like the use of particular locations and the choice of a specific time period or the construction of some characters. However, it mostly has to do with something more visceral, and it occurs generally in pieces by writer/directors. Gregg Mottola's ""Adventureland"" could very well be (actually, it is) a film of that type, but there's no genre that defines this. Setting in the eighties and introducing main and supporting characters that are well rounded, Mottola manages to create a state of mind and takes us back to the time and place of action: his intentions are genuine; his feelings seem completely exposed during the whole ride and the result in purely magical.A lot of this also took place in the director's previous film (and one that I should have written about), ""Superbad"". The movie exists in a different time if you don't think about the presence of the young and recognizable actors of the New American Comedy -that's how some people tend to call Judd Apatow related products- like Seth Rogen and Michael Cera; watching it means getting involved in a world of innocent fun and true friendship. These two things are fundamental in ""Adventureland"", which is a better film than its predecessor simply because Mottola takes it the whole way. He intentionally gets away from the comedy genre labels, casts more versatile and –in a sense- respected young actors for the main roles, keeps the genre's wild card (the name is Bill Hader) for the supporting department, gives the rest of the supporting players to names less recognizable than the ones mentioned above and brings Ryan Reynolds as the 'star' name in the ensemble. Reynolds is very low key, and fits perfectly for the tricky part he has to play.We are now in the eighties. The clothes, the attitude, the music and the same songs (that at accurate moments accompany the situations the characters are living) being played over and over again make it clear. Jesse Eisenberg, so good at looking as someone from that time in ""The Squid and the Whale"" and simply so good in ""Roger Dodger"", a key figure among independent young actors, plays the role of his life as James; a quirky, intellectual twenty-something virgin (it's a key word in the movie) whose highest virtue and worst defect is the same: sincerity. Because life sometimes sucks, James ends up working in an amusement park for the summer. He needs to collect money and he ends up living a summer of innocent fun and true friendship, with an added spark of love. Once the viewer becomes familiar with James and he meets Em (the beautiful and talented Kristen Stewart, so charming in ""Catch that kid"", so precise in ""Zathura"", so intense in ""Into the wild"", fantastic in ""In the land of women"", so good in ""Twilight"" and even better here), we can imagine where the story goes.Please understand that I don't want to tell you anything, but it's important to say that it's not so simple, and at the same time it is. ""Adventureland"" has a predictable structure, a lineal narrative just as ""Juno"", but it's not as complex as the film by Jason Reitman because it's less preconceived. The characters in ""Juno"" where intrepid and memorable because Diablo Cody intentionally wrote them that way, sitting in her house and knowing that she had something great in her hands that Reitman carefully and dedicatedly put on screen. Gregg Mottola's script (the whole movie actually) is so charged with an autobiographical sense that his feelings take over: the main characters are not well rounded because they were created intentionally with that purpose, they seem three-dimensional to us because they're constantly speaking their mind and we feel it; the stereotypical characters that sometimes appear are a requirement for the director's intention of 'taking us back' and they don't speak phrases in vain.For this reason, ""Adventureland"" can never be a 'coming of-age film', just as Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous"" wasn't. It can never be. It's filmed with too much romance, it's too flawed in many parts, and that's what makes it too great. As it happened to William in Crowe's movie, there are no life lessons for James here; just experiences that he takes to the long journey that will be the rest of his life.",Adventureland
62,charlytully,"Never give away the ""big-ass panda""!",6,7 April 2009,"Like most people, I was more interested in what games and rides they had at ADVENTURELAND than in who hooked up with what. The movie does not really do justice to the rides, because the people running the games were shown 90 per cent of the time. The main character, James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) seemed to spend most of his time with the horse race game. But James evidently also had to manage an adjacent ""rigged"" ring-toss game, as this is where a scammer extorted a ""big-ass panda"" from him at ""knife-point"" (to use the words of his crush, Em Lewin--Kristen Stewart). Sometimes he helped out his friend Joel (Martin Starr) at the ""rigged"" knock-a-hat-off-with-a-ball challenge. James was shown subbing at the squirt-water-into-the clown's-mouth-till-the-balloon-bursts game, as well, which his adulterer rival for Em's body, Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds) always seemed to be fixing. I believe Em ran the B-B gun shoot, though she was shown counting out tickets at the skee-ball bowling game later. When park manager Bobby (Bill Hader) gave James an orientation tour, he pointed out a ""rigged"" basketball-shooting game, but I never saw which carnie ran it. The one game I missed most from all my trips to the midway was the one with all the miniature fishbowls on a table, in which the contestants could win goldfish by plopping ping-pong balls into bowls (my girl and I came home with seven one time from the county fair in Sands). James was working at Adventureland for his first job after college graduation, and the management pulled a ""bait-and-switch"" on him, forcing him to run games when he thought he'd be a more prestigious rides man. I was really able to empathize with him, as I was promised a bus driver's job on the rim of the Grand Canyon by concessionaire Fred Harvey for MY own first post-college summer job. As it turned out, after driving halfway across the country, I spent four months there WASHING THE TOUR BUS WINDOWS in the middle of the night!",Adventureland

However, ""Adventureland"" came as a real surprise. There are moments of comedy, slapstick even, but they are carefully placed and when they do happen they're funny. ""Adventureland"" spares us dick jokes and forced awkward moments. Do you know how many other coming-of-age- comedies depict the life of young people as a neverending series of awkward situations? Now, true as that may be, only few of us have actually glued their hand to their penis while trying to masturbate or anything comparable. ""Adventureland"" doesn't go for cheap laughs. It's observant and delicate. It does show the uncertainty of youth when you're not sure if the other persons into you, when you don't know if the things you say are boring or interesting, when you're falling in love head over heels unsure how to express that - but all that is presented in a very subtle way, through looks or words left unsaid. The actors all do a very fine job at bringing this quilt of emotions across. You can relate to each and every one of them.The movie has even more going for itself: It's set in the 80's and unlike a lot of other movies that are supposedly taking place in that decade (""The Haunting In Connecticut"", anyone?), it actually feels like it. From the band t-shirts to the soundtrack (which includes a lot of Lou Reed/Velvet Underground, The Replacements, The Cure and Falco) it may seem as if all the ridiculous things that happened during the 80's were just a bad dream, but that doesn't matter because the bands and artists are well-picked and the whole thing does make you feel nostalgic - not just about the decade, but also about youth and the innocence of young love. In that respect - and in any other respect, too - ""Adventureland"" was so much more successful than the similarly themed ""Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist"". In a way it even captured the spirit of being young, that notion of happiness, the feeling that everything is possible, because your life has just begun, just as much as Bertolucci's ""The Dreamers"", although, of course, in a completely different context and in a much lighter way.""Adventureland"" probably compares better with Richard Linklater's ""Dazed & Confused"" and Jean-Marc Vallée's ""C.R.A.Z.Y."". It's bound to become a classic, and if you're skeptical like I was, just give the movie a chance. You'll laugh, maybe you'll cry, but most definitely you'll let out a sigh reminiscing about your own first love. You have been warned!",Adventureland
66,innocuous,"May strike a chord with SOME boomers, but.....",5,4 December 2009,"Yeah, it's worth watching, but the movie's themes are so off-putting to me and so totally unlike my own life that I just couldn't adjust to it. If the main character (James) had been a junior in high school, or a recent high school grad, it might have worked for me. As a 22-year-old college grad, it's difficult for me to imagine that he (along with his co-workers) are ""just discovering"" some of the basic aspects of real life. What the heck was he doing for four years in college? As for his planned European trip...what parent thinks he/she is doing something positive for his/her son by giving them a trip to Europe after graduation? He/she OUGHT to be working, either full-time or just to earn money for grad school. James is over 21...let him find his own way to Europe. (And, trust me, he thinks he's been sh** on because his parents are having a hard time financially and can't send him. What an egotistical twerp!) I guess the parents are expected to pay for grad school as well.I mean, I don't want to sound like an old-geezer, but it never would have occurred to my parents that they should send me on a European vacation after college. (Of course, I had already been married for a year at the age of 22.) What I'm trying to say is that this story might have played better if James (and most of the other characters) didn't come off as a bit whiny, harboring some (unexplained) greater expectations for their lives that are not based on merit or hard work. As it stands, the film crashes for me.On the other hand, the direction, acting and production are above-average. THAT'S what earns it five stars from me.",Adventureland
67,doctorsmoothlove,The Life Outside Your Apartment,8,14 April 2009,"Ah, here is a good family movie. Adventureland is rated ""R"" in the United States, but I see nothing unwholesome about it. It's an extremely well-rounded coming-of-age comedy that will entertain all family members. Of its rating, I assume the MPAA placed an R on what would otherwise have been PG-13 because of illegal drug use. This isn't the first time they've committed this error. Whale Rider was given PG-13 when it was obviously PG. Never mind my ramblings. On with reviewing this movie. As I've been surviving the dreariness of early year cinema, I had only seen one film which will make ""Blane's Most Cherished Movies"" for 2009. Now, I've seen another one. Adventureland takes teenage comedy melodrama and distills it with humanity. Unlike many of its competitors, it includes a plausible story and deeply flawed characters. I can imagine what occurs actually happening to these people, much like I did in Little Miss Sunshine.Jesse Eisenberg stars as James Brennan, a recent college graduate, who plans to spend summer touring Europe. His father is demoted, so James begins working at a local amusement park (see title). It's his first job, and he sucks at it. He even breaks the only rule his employers tell him: don't award anyone a Huge Ass Panda. I started my first official job as a librarian when I entered college, and I sucked too. I used to let patrons check out two reserve items, when page 22 Subsection C states that I shouldn't have. Eisenberg plays James' inexperience for many laughs, in spirit of Napoleon Dynamite. Also at the amusement park, Emily ""Em"" Lewin (Kristen Stewart) is a tomboyish young woman who is a bit younger than James and possesses more worldly knowledge (sex) than he does. She's his opposite, which means they will fall in love. The movie hints that every relatively young male employee is at least infatuated with her. I probably would be too. Anyway, Jesse begins hanging out with Em, and she invites him to a party. Em has been with a lot of men and doesn't know how to separate love from sex. James has never really dated, so he's sort of able to sympathize with her problem, though from a different perspective. Many, many amusing scenes are possible with this set up. James talks with his erudite friend Joel, also trying to win a female employee's affection, about their problems. Em mentions James to her vapid female co-workers. The theme park owners pinpoint the movie's dramatic irony whenever they aren't chasing unruly patrons with baseball bats. Em has conducted an affair with the Adventureland repairman and James finds out about it. They end their relationship, which never actually started. Joel also loses his love interest when she realizes that he is Jewish. He and James agree that their shared identity as less-than-desirable guys is better than living with fulfillment (women). Anyway, Em quits working at Adventureland and goes to New York for college. James quits too, but to find a real job. They meet and finally agree to start dating. And they never want to go to Adventureland again. I don't plan on working in a library after 2012, by the way.Humor is plentiful and surprisingly varied. The film is set in the late 1980's, and ""Rock Me Amadeus"" is played fifty thousand times. James' ""friend"" Bobby kicks him in his genitals whenever they meet. Just about any comedic situation possible at an amusement park happens. Sometimes it becomes contrived, honestly. Still, an armed guy chasing someone for a cheap Malaysian stuffed Panda is always funny. Mottola makes a wise decision not to include too much teen-specific humor and adds many moments of genuine conflict. Unlike Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, last year's romantic teen comedy, Adventureland strives for social realism, which is more humorous. We can laugh at James, Em, or Joel because we are familiar with their difficulties. Nick and Norah is forced to rely on comedy staples like the drunken best friend to entertain us. Adventureland whirls its way through 107 minutes by hoping its characters consistently make poor decisions. I've read many critiques (from fellow amateur film reviewers) of this weakness, from sources as diverse as UNCG's student newspaper. My response: there would be no movie without this condition. Movies are sensationalized to exploit schadenfreude. Avenue Q's portrayal of Gary Coleman notes ""everybody does it."" He is correct. We like seeing people suffer, yet we still wish for their success (if they are good, which these people are). My complaint is slightly different. Kristen Stewart bothers me, a lot. I never feel like I'm watching a performance when I see her on screen. She isn't going through the motions, like Nicolas Cage in Bangkok Dangerous. Stewart has no screen presence in Adventureland, Twilight, or Zathura. All I see is a young woman on screen handing out cheap plush toys, gliding through the tree tops, or lusting after spacemen. Take this moment in Adventureland, when Em tells James she is baked. She forwardly remarks, ""I'm so high"". No one does that in real life, much less in the movies. Even a stylized portrayal would have been better than that. Roger Ebert recently published a positive review of The Cake Eaters, in which he kinda praises her acting. Maybe that's worth a rental.**** out of *****",Adventureland
68,brett-76260,Actually not bad,8,9 March 2021,Didn't go into this expecting much... but was pleasantly surprised on how good it was. Kind of original and soundtrack certainly brings back great memories of been a teenager in the 80's. You could find worse movies to watch that's for sure. Give it a go... it's worth your time if you like this genre of movies...,Adventureland
69,Ali_John_Catterall,Satin Lives,8,26 July 2010,"What an adorable little film this is. Razor-sharp too, which ironically helped it fall squarely between the cracks during that non-summer of 2009; but then, unlike the director's Superbad, the touching, semi-autobiographical Adventureland was always going to be a trickier sell. Opening with the Velvets' 'Here She Comes Now', and marinated in the spirit of Richard Linklater rather than Judd Apatow, it's unashamedly aimed at the smart kids – a crisp glass of white to Superbad's premium-strength lager.Though set in 1987, it's also distinctly unlike the usual ""I Heart the 1980s"" retro-cizes: here, Falco's deathless 'Rock Me Amadeus' is the eternal, sadistic soundtrack to Eisenberg's McJob in a grungy amusement park, staffed by fellow overachieving, under-waged misfits; Martin Starr being standout as the pipe-smoking Joel – every inch 'Robert Crumb: The Wonder Years.' One more thing: switch off exactly five minutes before the credits, and this'll retain its fantastic authenticity uncorrupted.",Adventureland
70,jts0405,Not so great in the long run,4,1 August 2009,"Adventureland honestly was advertised as a comedy, then it just didn't turn out as one. This movie is actually just a love story with some drama behind it. No doubt that it is now a key in some comedies, but this truly never became comedic. There was one piece of recurring humorous material, in which Frigo would hit James in the nuts, but even that grew old after the 5th or 6th time. All in all the movie sort of disappointed me. There may be some out there that truly enjoyed this, and that is fine if you did, but for me I expected a lot more of a comedy than what I got. So if your in the mood for a drama with a troubled young love story, then go for this.",Adventureland
71,dansview,Mostly Bad,4,18 August 2012,"There are few normal people in this film. Maybe that's because it's supposed to be at least partially a comedy, but I found this disturbing. Almost everyone is either a Godless cynic, an alcoholic, an adulterer, a depressive, a shallow materialist, or a dork. Ironically, the supposedly wacky amusement park director played by SNL's Bill Hader, was actually an optimistic and upbeat character. He runs the park with enthusiasm and industry.I understand that the makers of this film were atheistic Liberal Arts nerds in the 80s, and they are writing about the world that they know and remember. Fine, but God help the impressionable young folks who view this and think the world was and is, like it is depicted in this film.In the real world, not everyone working at an amusement park would hate their job. Not every guy is either a horny, jock materialist, or a nerdy buffoon. Not every girl is either a tease, a slut, or a lost soul cynic.Jesse Eisenberg plays the same guy in every movie, which I assume is basically himself. Having said that, I will admit that he is a reasonably charming guy, and I could see why girls would like his honesty and sense of humor.I don't see why his character would like the Kristen Stewart character. She is always depressed, makes no attempt to look good, and has no beliefs or goals. But OK, I understand that all such types do exist, and the film makers decided to focus on these types.Within that context, I will say that Jesse Eisenberg's character was lovable, and somewhat optimistic in his own way. That was the best aspect of this movie. He rolls with the punches with a certain freshness and hope that I did find appealing.I would have preferred to have had at least one character challenge the whole European pessimism motif. It was the 80s. Was there not even one character working at the park who got Reagan's message of optimism and patriotism?OK, I guess the film makers are Jewish and fit a certain stereotype that they make sure to share with you in this film. That virtually no one is religious or takes pride in their Jewishness, and the one guy who does is a hypocrite.But there are neighborhoods in Pittsburgh filled with many observant Jewish families who take their Judaism seriously. I guess they don't travel in the same circles as a guy who makes teen sex movies.Watch this movie if you identify with Jesse Eisenberg's persona, or you are attracted to Ryan Reynolds or Kristen Stewart. Otherwise, stay away. It's lacking the wit and originality of the classic 80s teen films.",Adventureland
72,jonathan-577,"details, details",8,21 April 2009,"Flawed both micro and macro, and lovely anyway. The byways of the romantic plot are extremely familiar, things go on about ten minutes too long, and at times the 1987 thing carries the whiff of target marketing. Furthermore, who on earth in 1987 was trying to talk teenage girls into bed by talking about jamming with freaking Lou Reed? I mean, were they digging ""Mistrial""? We're in the realm of fantasy here, and I'm guessing Yo La Tengo had something to do with it: they get a music credit for about 45 seconds of noodles, which makes me suspect they had a hand in choosing the archival stuff as well. It's the kind of stuff you listened to if you were in a band at the time. But hell, fantasy is OK, and the romantic angst goes down easier if you look at it as another 80s tribute: the reason it's familiar, after all, is that it's total John Hughes territory. So with all that out of the way, you can concentrate on the best ensemble acting I've seen in years, by a bunch of very likable young pros; a script that could teach the Guest team something about maximal info with minimal detail; a fantastic production design job teeming with edge-of-frame sight gags; and some really, really great tunes.",Adventureland
73,Ramascreen,"We are doing the work of lazy, pathetic morons!",8,5 April 2009,"I did not expect this to be a romantic comedy at all. The marketing tricked us into believing that it's just another teen sex comedy especially by emphasizing that it's directed by the director of Superbad. But writer/director Greg Mottola has brought us his own personal experience plus... a love story that today's teens can relate to even when the story is set in the 80s. ADVENTURELAND is not what you'd consider a laugh out loud riot but it's still in its own right, a funny, clever, and once again, surprisingly romantic dramedy .Halfway through the movie I almost got upset because I didn't get to laugh much, I was waiting and waiting for that Superbad-like toilet humor that get you right where the sun don't shine but ADVENTURELAND apparently was never aiming for that in the first place.I respect how Greg Mottola makes the characters so rich, as in they got so much going, no wonder they're all f*ed up, working in a f*ed up job like an amusement that everybody loves to hate. Having said that, the job itself provides us with a different, interesting look at Carny folks. Especially some of the tricks they'd pull just to keep the customers from winning the games. The cliques, the gossip, the stress, and of course the crush.It all boils down to a love story between Jesse's character, James and Kristen Stewart's character, Em. The way that Greg Mottola sets it in motion wastes no minute at all. There's no playing hard too get. Em quickly likes the nice guy she sees in James and there's something about Em that James notices and it gets him hooked.Once again, Greg Mottola doesn't stop with only those two, all the other supporting characters also have their own story that compliments the themes and what the movie's all about. Each complication leads up to James realizing what he's done and how he can fix it. Ryan Reynolds plays the park's repairman who engages in forbidden affairs but Mottola doesn't have him fight James, in fact I think Mottola wants to show that some people don't change, they'll always be like that and the only way to end the vicious cycle is to get out of the world that you're too comfortable with so much so that it's holding you back, in this case it's the ADVENTURELAND park.As far as humor goes, it does it at the expense of rude customers, punching a guy in the balls, the odd yet quirky chemistry between Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig who are obviously the main comic relief in this movie. It still toys around with youth's obsession with sex. But other than that, prepare yourself for some dialogue and confrontation that will get you surprised at how sincere the story can be.Jesse Eisenberg is the right man for this job, my only objection is that he talks way too damn fast. I can understand every word he says and I get that he wants to come off as that nervous, geeky virgin nerd but I think he could've said his lines in a bit calmer tone. Kristen Stewart was just a cute girl in Twilight but in ADVENTURELAND, she shows her sexy, wild side.I love how this movie wants to show us that starting a relationship isn't as easy as 1, 2, 3 because you have to take into account brutal honesty and embrace the other person's demons to make it work.I think today's teens will find this relevant, teens who have tough relationship with their parents, teens who have difficulties facing their future, and teens with insecurity, who'd turn to all the wrong places instead of the one good thing that they forget to appreciate.--Rama's SCREEN--",Adventureland
74,PoisonKeyblade,best dramedy ever,10,6 May 2009,"With a stellar 80's soundtrack and unforgettable performances from leads Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg, Adventureland is one of 2009's finest subtle comedies. Without completely overdoing things with over-the-top sexual jokes and in-your-face moments of physical comedy, the R-rated film written and directed by Greg Mottola (2007's smash hit Superbad) is the perfect example of the right way to do a memorable comedy.Sometimes the simplest of plots can produce the greatest films. This is just your average tale of guy gets summer job, guy falls for girl, and then problems arise. Only, Adventureland longs to be more than just your average tale. It has all the makings of a cult following, and it's a big throwback to the 80's, with a very groovy soundtrack and even a trip to a disco club.Like I said before, the acting is one of the film's best aspects. Having a cast of hilarious people, even if they aren't hilarious in this specific film (I'm looking at you, Kristen Wiig), is always a plus. Jesse Eisenberg was probably the movie's biggest surprise. I'd only seen him in Cursed before this movie, so I wasn't sure what to expect. In a way, his performance channeled a bit of Michael Cera, but somehow better, slightly more sophisticated and less awkward.Kristen Stewart, though, has always had awkward as her strong suit, and this movie is no exception. While she might have seemed a little uncomfortable as Bella Swan in the Twilight movie, Stewart seems right at home here as the pretty, quiet girl who is much more than she seems on the surface. The role is challenging in that she needed to bring a lot to the table. Stewart really becomes the character of Em, so much so that she just comes off completely effortless.One of the strongest suits of the movie is how subtle all of the jokes are. The scene with the googly eyes was one of my personal favorites, one of the very few scenes with Kristen Wiig. The love story that becomes a central plot point of the movie really flourishes throughout the course of the movie, and you definitely get the feeling that these two like each other. I almost want to say that they had better chemistry than half of the current selection of movie romances.In the smaller roles, Ryan Reynolds is quite the douchebag, and he plays the role with great enthusiasm. While it was a very different role for him to play (he's usually the funny sidekick or the leading man), he played it well. All of the rest of the side players make harrowing contributions to the story and laughs, and make everything all the better.Overall, color me surprised with how much I totally fell in love with Adventureland. The immersive story, 80's feel, and layered characters make for one of the year's best films. I wasn't expecting to like the movie half as much as I did, but the script and actors elevated the movie far beyond what was glimpsed in the trailer.",Adventureland
75,webmaster-3017,HK Neo Reviews: Adventureland,8,28 October 2009,"Tagline: Back to the 80s in a good way Review by Neo: Adventureland simply works because it is honest, believable, touching and earnestly frank film that never attempts to be pretentious. These kinds of films are rare and hard to come by, but director of Superbad hits all the right buttons to create something truly an experience to remember despite bringing nothing new on the table. There was once a saying, people do not remember time, but we remember the moments. It is the simple moments of cinematic magic that made the film work and it's been a while coming since Hollywood goes real and quite satisfying it is.The movie goes like this: Jesse Eisenberg plays a college graduate who is in the midst of a summer job at the local theme park. There Jesse meets a complicated, yet rich young girl (played by the elegant Kristen Steward who is a student from NYU. It is basically a story about two lost souls, bored to death of their summer job, bond together despite two beings from two very different worlds.Kristen Stewart is definitely a real talent and while she is wasted away from the Twilight series, Stewart is stunning yet complicated here. She is not exactly what one would say outright beautiful, but there is something about her that ""it"" aspect that will ensure her route to stardom will work. There are moments in which Stewart manages to pull it off, such as the scene where she and Jesse first kisses, her moments with Ryan Reynolds and many others. In a matter of fact, despite being a supporting role to Jesse's character, it is Stewart that made the film interesting and somehow even manages to make the audience feel for her becoming. Most certainly this is a bravo and potential filled display and one to watch for the future.Jesse Eisenberg is the kind of guy that is rare nowadays, but I am sure there are still people like him. That is why director Greg Mottola made a smart decision to set the movie in the 80s, when life was slow and the rain was mellow. People aren't totally technologically dependent and that is why the film worked. It is the simple things that matters and Jesse smartly underplays his character innocence and also the way he interacts with others is quite simply good acting. Perhaps the music also worked to a degree, but at the end of the day, it all goes down to the believable chemistry between Jesse and Kristen.All in all, Adventureland is not going to split the world on fire with originality, but what it does is able to spark new life into an already cliché genre. The way director Greg Mottola handled the ending is something to be proud of. The rain drops, the persistence, the dialogue, the timing, the moments, are all reasons as to why the film ultimately leaves the audience on a satisfying note. Love is never straight forward and nothing is ever more intriguing to witness and experience than young love, as it is the times, when one another grow through these experiences, learn as it go and basically a work in progress and quite raw. Adventureland works by being taking the audience back to those tiny moments, those times when we were young and after all John Lennon is probably right when he say: Life is what happens, when you are busy making other plans  (Neo 2009) I rate it 8/10www.thehkneo.com",Adventureland
76,raisleygordon,Leaves a lot to be desired,3,21 April 2010,"I live near Pittsburgh, so I had another reason to look forward to seeing this. I first heard of the movie on the local news (WTAE), when it announced the production. However, I did not enjoy the movie, which was, sadly, not worth the price of admission (I saw it two years ago) Boy, did I waste six bucks. There's no reason this movie has to be so low-key. Then again, it takes place in 1980's. The characters are not especially interesting, nothing remotely bad ever happens (except for a drunk-driving incident near the end of the movie), not a lot happens, and worst of all, I didn't care. Had I been a lot older in 1987, maybe it would have been more interesting, or at least comprehensible.** out of ****",Adventureland
77,johnsmithjanuary-20081,dreary nothingness,3,15 October 2021,Way too much dramatic romantic tension and depressing themes throughout. Imagine if Jesse Eisenberg was in a romance flick and this is what you would get. Far too awkward to be a comedy movie. Disappointing.,Adventureland
78,gregeichelberger,Viewers of the trailer may be disappointed; I wasn't,6,7 April 2009,"Those viewers who assume that Greg Mottola's ""Adventureland"" is anything like the current trailer now playing may find themselves sorely disappointed when they arrive at the cinemaplex and discover the movie is not a sequel to the director's last effort, ""Superbad."" Oh sure, there are teenage virgin boys, hot young ladies and enough pot to choke Seth Rogen, but this tale of adolescent awakenings and dead-end, post-high school summer jobs is much deeper, more thoughtful and the humor rings truer than your run-of-the-mill contemporary raucous teen comedy.It's 1987 in Pittsburgh and brainiac James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg, a kind of Andy Samberg-lite, who appeared in ""The Squid and the Whale"") has been accepted into Columbia University and is planning a trip to Europe as a graduation present. Then, however, his father (character actor Jack Gilpin) is demoted and the funds for the vacation are no longer available. To make matters worse, the only way to raise money is for James to seek employment at a dumpy, run-down amusement park (hence the title) where the rides are broken, the games are crooked and the employees are either teenagers in between menial positions or adults firmly set on the road to lifelong loserville.Immediated tagged as a ""game guy"" (although he'd rather operate the Tilt-A-Whirl) by the park's supervisor, Bob (Bill Hader, ""Hot Rod,"" ""SNL""), James tries to work up enough enthusiasm to call lame horse races at his booth. Bob's efforts to infuse some passion into the young man are some of the most funny moments of the picture. James would have gone completely off his rocker had it not been for his co-worker friends, including Joel (Mark Short), local lawyer's daughter, Emily (Kristen Stewart, ""The Messengers,"" ""Twilight""), and the demented Frigo (Matt Bush), who shows his affection towards James by constantly punching him in the groin.Hey, I think we can all relate (with the possible exception of the belt in the testicle thing). My first job after high school was a mid-1980s gig as a cook at Kentucky Fried Chicken (long before they began referring to it as ""KFC""). Many an evening - covered in grease and flour - I would dream of dating one of the gorgeous cash register girls (it never happened), with only my buds to help get over the depressing reality.In the film, James and Em hit it off at a party and sort of begin seeing each other; although she still pines for Brad, the park's maintenance man and musician (Ryan Renyolds) who is married and continues to lie about once jamming with Lou Reed. When he finds out about this, James dates ice cold dancing diva Lisa P. (Margarita Levieva), just for spite. When he reveals Em and Brad's affair, Lisa spills the news all over the park causing her to quit and James to re-evaluate his feelings for her.And while it would have been easier for him to get as far away from Em and her emotional problems as he could, he does the thoughtful, yet completely unexpected thing.Since the movie's time-line is 1987 (a year many of us remember very well), one can also expect to hear some pretty cool pop tracks from such artists as Expose, Sheila E. Whitesnake, Animotion, Falco and Crowded House, among others. Overall, while throwing a curve to its trailer audience, ""Adventureland"" is a decent enough film. Far too many scenes of toking on joints for my taste (I was thankfully never into drugs as a teen), but it does not detract from the message of the period between post prep school liberation and those awkward first steps towards true adulthood.It's a time I would gladly return to if possible.",Adventureland
79,mistoppi,Excellent simple movie about teenagers,8,13 August 2016,"There is one aspect that makes Adventureland stand out from other movies about teenagers. Adventureland isn't overly dramatic. I don't think there is a one scene in this film that made me roll my eyes and think ""well that would never happen"". Adventureland is simple, which makes it realistic. The problems these characters are having, their feelings and situations, are very familiar to many teenagers, which means Adventureland doesn't alienate teenage viewers - apart from most of the actors clearly not being teenagers.While the story is simple, it's also intriguing. You want to see what happens, how the main character is going to screw up this time. You also want to see if something crucial is going to be revealed from the characters. There are a lot of characters who make the audience wonder what's up with them, why they are the way they are. Well, we don't get much insight on that, just hints, clues. That isn't disappointing however, it feels okay. After all, you never know everything about everyone.The fact that Adventureland took place in the 80's didn't seem to hold much meaning. It affected the soundtrack and technology available, that's it. It wouldn't have much effect if the movie didn't mention that it happened in the 80's. The problems and the events of the movie are more or less ageless. They could happen in the 80's, in the 90's, 2010's, in the future... Crushes, love, bad jobs and money issues are always there. Of course the 80's music goes very well with the movie. The songs used are amazing. The music alone could've been enough to make the movie feel like 80's. I'm not sure if I'm a fan of Jesse Eisenberg's acting. He seems like Michael Cera: they both seem to have that one character over and over again.Sure, Eisenberg is really good at that one character, but what does it tell us about his skills?Adventureland is an interesting movie. I don't like all the plot points, but it makes me just the tiniest bit inspired. I'm just not sure what it's inspiring me to do. Write a YA-novel? Have more teenager experiences like this one? I just don't know. But I enjoyed this movie.",Adventureland
80,Bruce722,Eisenberg and Stewart shine!,6,27 October 2013,"Adventureland was a lot better film than I anticipated. The summary sounds incredibly boring, which it is. There is really no excitement or anything overly engaging about the film. However, Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, and the rest of the cast make for an interesting story. Their characters are really well developed and how all of them mesh together during a summer of non-fun in the 1980's is intriguing. Eisenberg and Stewart play the same exact roles they do in every single film I've ever seen them in. Eisenberg is a neurotic but witty guy with self-esteem issues and Stewart is a beautiful but troubled young woman with emotional issues. They definitely don't go outside the box for their roles but they have mastered their niche archetypes. All-in-all, this isn't the most entertaining movie around but it has a certain charm to it. The characters feel real, the music takes you back in time to a more pure era, and the story is relatable to just about everyone.",Adventureland

He meets a girl who he falls for, hes a virgin and she's sleeping with a much older married man. He has to learn many lessons before realizing she is the one for him.These movies try to be deep and touching, but often are boring and unoriginal. I thought this movie was okay. I recall the first time I got it on DVD I tried watching it but just couldn't make it through it. I made it the other night and I must say it's worth a watch.Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart seem to be two of the hottest teen players out there right now. Kristen does good as the troubled teenage girl outcast and Jesse seems to play the adorable geek well. Many of the people casted here were great, I could have done without Ryan Reynolds as I think he is a talentless actor.I liked the music here, the movie starts off with The Replacements ""Bastards of Young"" and goes through everything from Lou Reed and The Velvet Underground to Alex Chilton tunes , Whitesnake, Poison, Husker Du, Mary Jane Girls, The outfield, The Stones, and many more and don't forget 'Rock Me Amadeus' played about 50 times as part of an inside joke.For lack of a better word, I will call it ""cute"". A lot of troubled teens, lots of weed and drinking, fooling around and a movie about being a kid. It had good music and clothes from the era, the movie is set in 1987.

A nicely understated movie, decent story and acting, along with some great musical gems throughout.Replacements, Dolls, Velvets, & The Huskers on the soundtrack instead of the usual Bon Jovi, Journey and Survivor crap which usually come with 80's period pieces helped out a bunch.Nice job Mr. Mottola. The laughs weren't plentiful, but they weren't forced either.And Martin Starr seems to have taken his Bill Haverchuck character from FREAKS AND GEEKS (set in 1980) and graduated to an overeducated 1987 carny, to full comic effect.My only quibble was with the Foreigner cover band in the bar scene. While the bombastic portrayal was funny, that band had pretty much dropped off the commercial landscape by the late 80's, and I really doubt any bar would be featuring a such an outfit in '87.Still, I'm recommending ADVENTURELAND.",Adventureland

I knew it wasn't going to be a comedy like Superbad but I didn't really know what to expect.Overall, I think the movie was great. The cast was well selected. The love story wasn't cheesy or forced on with constant sex innuendo.Although I thought Reynolds was underused in the film, he delivered a great performance.It did feel a little weird watching 31 year old Reynolds lip locking a 17 year old Stewart but.. Stewart played Em's vulnerability and personal problems in a very convincing manner. Her real life mannerisms were sure blended in the character but it just fitted Em.I think you can classify it more as a drama than a comedy.

87,RCWjr,A solid effort,7,31 August 2009,"Adventureland does a Hughes-esquire (albeit r-rated) job of capturing the transition from college grad to crossroads full-time working adult. The atmosphere of working at a local carnival for the summer in the late 80's is effectively captured and becomes itself a character of the show.Kristen Stewart, fresh off Twilight fame, shows she can emote without blinking her eyes a dozen times a second (her trademark hair tugging is still on show though, something I think is just a habit which no one has yet to break her of). Jesse Eisenberg does his best Michael Cera impression throughout the film. I don't say that in a bad way, but it seems Eisenberg went to the same school of acting Cera did as both use the same delivery style and physical gestures in conveying a smart, not totally geek, but close enough, guy. Supporting characters are fun to watch throughout; Martin Starr being one of the best. The biggest surprise of the film was Ryan Reynolds in the character of ""Mike Connell"". At no time does he revert to his Van Wilder persona, which has popped up in most all of his work. Mike is a married, handyman, full of more b.s. than truth, who likes the young girls is pitch perfect. Reynolds is able to give Mike a sense of tragic underachiever who you, as the viewer, can't fully hate or despise, much like the characters in the movie can't.Not a movie that I would normally see and not one that I plan on purchasing on video, but for a rental when it comes to video, you could do far worse.

88,AscendeSuperius,The perfectly ordinary teen flick,7,10 August 2021,"This semi raunchy comedy was both refreshing yet felt like the many other good teen flicks I saw. It manages to be raunchy without it going overboard, realistic while retaining the magic and absurdness of romance, and funny without being lame. And while yes there were a few quirks of the film, it still manages to leave a smile on my face and that to me, is the best tell tale sign of a good, feel good film.",Adventureland
89,piratecannon,It Doesn't Quite Win the Giant Panda,7,26 December 2012,"Over the past few years there's been a flurry of coming-of-age flicks that star quirky (yet believable) teens trying to find their footing in an increasingly complex world. Set in 1987, Adventureland chronicles the er adventures of a struggling post-graduate student who's forced to find a summer job after his father suffers a pay-cut at work. James (Jesse Eisenberg) had previously planned to spend the summer traveling Europe, and, upon his return to the states, was going to attend Columbia University to study journalism. Now he's stuck in a suburb of Pittsburgh, working at a cheesy (though charming) amusement park called— you guessed it—Adventureland.Thankfully, Adventureland manages to put a slightly different spin on a familiar formula by focusing on people who are really adults—even though these ""kids"" look young, they're all old enough to drink and are pining to support themselves financially. Setting the movie in the 80s is a smart move, as it amps up the humor and allows writer and director Greg Mottola to focus on the class struggle that was so characteristic of that era (with preppy/yuppie businessmen at one extreme and nerdy/middle-to-lower class ""real people"" at the other). Also present are the usual parental woes associated with that transitional age. Adventureland does dare to dig a little deeper than the usual late-teen- angst-fare, as it wrestles with the psychological/emotional turmoil churned up in the wake of dealing with stepmothers, alcoholic fathers, and, again, the need to maintain a proper ""front"" for everyone around you. This, of course, is a theme that transcends the seemingly oblivious parental figures in the movie: it manifests itself in the soap opera-esque world of the amusement park these kids work at, and watching it all unfold is something akin to a train wreck. You hate to see it coming, but you can't turn away.And the acting in Adventureland is solid all around. Kristen Stewart (who plays Em) conjures up some very believable emotional breakdowns, and Eisenberg capably ambles through his ""Michael Cera"" existence of being the smarmy, misunderstood dweeb. Really, if the movie has a notable weakness it has to be found in the mind-numbingly predictable plot. Even though there's just enough humor and sincerity to keep you interested, there's a good chance you'll feel as if you're ""going through the motions"" as things progress. When the final act was in full swing, I found myself groaning with the realization of what was to come: the usual earth-shattering revelation by a naive protagonist who eventually hashes out (via a system of drunkenness and rebuke) that making amends and simply accepting things is the answer to all of his problems. You'll see the conclusion coming, and, as the credits start to roll, it'll all seem a tad bit too tidy.Still, there's a lot to like in Adventureland. The believability and humor make it a worthy addition to your Netflix queue, but, I'm sorry to say, it's got nothing on the spectacular (500) Days of Summer. Which, I believe, will be arriving very soon on Blu-ray and DVD. Excellent.",Adventureland
90,SeriousJest,"Watch this movie, but expect a drama, rather than a comedy",7,14 September 2012,"This movie is worth setting aside time to watch, at some point, as a drama. It's a great coming-of-age film and a clever 1980′s throwback, with a healthy amount of dark comedy woven throughout the film so that you will get some laughs (especially in the scenes involving Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig, and Matt Bush), but if you go in expecting a light-hearted comedy like Superbad, you may be overwhelmed or even depressed by the seriousness of some of the scenes. Eisenberg seems to have only one speed (nerdy, awkward guy with redeeming cool qualities), but he plays it very well. Stewart delivered ""The Girlfriend Experience"" (see my review of The Dilemma for an explanation, as applied to Jennifer Connelly) solidly in this flick, even though her character was riddled with layers of complexity that arguably sometimes made her difficult to like. Reynolds continued to display his range with a solid contribution as a stoic, ironically-pitiful heartthrob rocker who was somehow simultaneously an antagonist and Big Brother Mentor he was also definitely an Ineffectual Loner. Finally, Margarita Levieva was sexy and charismatic, despite her character's obvious shallowness and did you know she was an Olympic-caliber rythmic gymnast, an Economics major at New York University, and a Jersey girl? I am now a fan, and I'd love to see her in more movies.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out www.livemancave.com",Adventureland

She has a small, downturned mouth that suggests vulnerability. And the muscles in her forehead do amazing things. But it's her haunted eyes that really come across. Looking into her eyes, you sense some past damage. She always understates, which is killer effective. I can't wait to see her portray Joan Jett in ""The Runaways"" next year.""Adventureland"" is Greg Mottolla showing that his writing and directing chops have only increased since ""Superbad,"" which was a horny high school student romp while this is kind of a horny graduate student romp. The dialogue comes close to being almost too clever for its own good. Terrific lines are tossed off so casually they can go right past you.Set in 1987, when I was in my thirties, I can testify to the authenticity. The soundtrack is amazing. If you were at all hip in 1987, you loved the Replacements but were appalled by ""Rock Me Amadeus."" And the Velvet Underground's ""Pale Blue Eyes"" has always needed a movie to be part of. This is that movie. And, in 1987, if you were young, marijuana was your oxygen.The movie itself is formulaic boy meets girl. This time, at a cheesy amusement park one summer. Ryan Reynolds and Kristen Wiig operate the park, which has low-rent rides and ""games"" that are impossible to beat. Boy and girl working at the park fall in love.

92,MovieZoo,Adventureland: Closed for demolition,2,3 April 2009,"Adventureland was the name and extreme deception was its game. The movie was quite different from what the trailers depicted. The trailer gives one the feeling there is somewhat of a faster pace with a deliberate sense of juvenile humor. I went in thinking that's what I would get. Instead, angst and doubt were more apparent. Therefore, the ride tossed us all 180 degrees and upside down nauseating us all. Anyone going in for the laugh will quickly recognize the deception. At best, a few chuckles will be all you get - if you can avoid tossing your cookies long enough.I felt like someone in an extremely long line, waiting to get into the park so I could get onto the roller coaster I could hear making the clakkity-clakkity whooooshing sounds that made me nearly drool from anticipation. But when I get in, I see the trash littering the grounds and rides made of cheap plastic and tin. Even though the main ride gives me a couple minutes of enjoyment, it was not what I wanted and after 20 - 30 minutes I already wanted to go home.I am so tired of movies that get made only because it can be done. The production was so bad that it seemed the production team could very easily have been the characters themselves. This movie was not nearly as thought provoking as the creators may have thought. They should 'fess up and tell us they messed up. If they wanted us to appreciate the moment at the end, they should have tried connecting the beginning and middle with the same attention as they paid at the end. While the teens are growing up and the adults are acting like fools, no one even comes close to connecting with the audience except for Kristen Stewart's sad and self-deprecating Em.I have to say that I was totally offset by a scene where sensitivity towards political correctness was tarnished by irreverence to a ""retarded""(their phrase) gate attendant. It was extremely hypocritical. In this scene, Em chastises someone for being ""anti-gay and a bigot"" while another character (I forget who) makes a poorly placed ""joke"" about the gate attendant. Funny how this thoughtlessness was shown by the creative team who made a movie about people who lacked thoughtfulness.Save your money, miss the movie. Rating this travesty a 2/10",Adventureland

I can see why some people wouldn't like this movie. I do really like coming of age movies, so maybe that's why I can look past a lot of flaws, but hey. You like what you like and certain movies work for certain people for various reasons. I tend to relate to characters on these types of movies. It's about a guy named James Brennan, played by Jesse Eisenberg, who has to get a summer job in order to save money to either go to college or go to Europe (I can't remember). He ends working at an amusement park and there he meets some new friends. The movie follows what they do throughout the runtime. And for the most part, this works. The movie is funny and at the very least watchable. However, I do feel like there are several parts of this film where the humor is absent for longer than necessary, and it can get slightly boring and overly dramatic at some points. Ultimately, I think the good outweighs the bad however and I say you watch it. Though like I said, I can see why you wouldn't like it.",Adventureland
94,joker-4,True nostalgia; clever story; great characters,9,9 July 2012,"Every couple of years a nostalgic film of note comes along allowing the previous generation to remember the glory days of old. Director Greg Mottola provides this with ADVENTURELAND, his follow up to the comedic hit SUPERBAD. Set smack in the late '80s, ADVENTURELAND tells the coming-of-age tale, which such movies are ought to do, of likable, Spielbergian every-boy James who schulbs along in the self-titled ma- and-pa run amusement park the summer before grad school. Starring a pre-SOCIAL NETWORK Jessie Eisenberg as the likable lad, TWILIGHT's Kristen Stewart, getting her Indie-chops on, as the girl-of- his-dreams and a pre-GREEN LANTERN Ryan Reynolds as the bad boy who holds her heart. ADVENTURELAND plays to the clichés of the time wrapped around a soundtrack of familiar standards, including many that normally don't make the cinematic memory rounds, and, if anything, tells truths that most Gen-Xers either believe, lived through or simply fall prey to that great lie of ""remember the time...?"" when friends, co-workers or whoever just sorta hung out and talked.With those truths is the, again, likable geek James, who could very well have been written into a John Hughes movie, learns, harshly, that a smooth life isn't handed out, you have to work and relationships aren't as perfect as one may think. Aside from some killer New Wave music, and Cold War paranoia, one of the things the 80s provided was the nuclear family sometimes detonated and that teenage infidelity was as rampant as Sylvester Stallone movies. ADVENTURELAND doesn't make importance of the tearing down of the Berlin Wall, rather shows the importance of breaking walls between friends and how going on a date with the wrong girl has just as many consequences as the Iran-Contra Affair.Greg Mottola successfully gives those that have been there a great memory and provides a laugh at times gone by for those that weren't. By the film's end, James needs not to crash his father's Ferrari to gain attention but also knows he's well past his sixteenth birthday to wait and nab the girl.",Adventureland

There is no significant insight or socially redeeming value.I have only seen the Blu-Ray version so I cannot compare it to others. The DVD starts with the obligatory coming attractions and ""is not Blu-Ray great"" statement. Then there is an anti-smoking commercial. If you can remember what film you put in the player are lucky. There are the standard bonus features, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and whatnot. Usually, the audio commentary gives insight to the movie that you hadn't noticed forcing you to watch it again now that you have this new vision.

If not, you'll probably find it boring as it is quite slow going. There are moments of humour but the story is primarily about the chaotic lives of all the characters. In my experience, life really is just like that, so I enjoyed it a lot.One negative is that Kristen Wiig is given top billing but she isn't really in it at all.

While his parents feel the job is beneath his college degree qualifications, it's the only job he can find so he takes it, and ends up working the game show booths.

Kristen, incidentally, seems to be playing the same exact character she played in ""Twilight"", wounded and needy.Based on the trailers, I was expecting something along the lines of ""Superbad"" but the movie was a lot closer to ""Dazed & Confused"", a well written period piece of the 1970's. The comedy aspect of the movie was in the interactions with his friends, parents, co-workers, and supervisors.

Jesse played Mark Zuckerberg in 'The Social Network'. 'nuff said there. And Kristen... goodness she is a beauty. The actress is just wounded enough to allow her to call on the proper emotion as required and make you believe it. These two, as well as the rest of the cast, make you fully believe the characters are actually going through the stuff they go through. The film has a slower, relaxed pace, and the comedic moments are more spaced out, yet perfect when they come. Of course you can be laughing much of the time as you see yourself in these young people when you were that age and doing the same silly kinds of things.

107,johnmichael-2,Adequate entertainment from the director of Superbad,6,26 March 2009,"I saw an advanced screening of ""Adventureland"" on my college campus tonight. It chronicles the coming-of-age tale about James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg), who has just graduated from college and is set for a trip to Europe before he goes to grad school at Columbia University. The only problem is that it's the late 1980's, the economy has taken a downslide, and his dad's job got caught up in it--he was transferred to a position that offered less money, and now James's trip to Europe is canceled, as is his monetary support for his continued schooling. This means one unpleasant thing: James must get a summer job. And the only place this comparative lit major can find labor is at a miserable amusement park called Adventureland. But of course he meets and falls in love with a girl (Kristen Stewart), and from there the movie is pretty easy to follow.I must say, this movie was done quite adequately. There was nothing wrong with it. The acting was good (for the most part). The screenplay rolled along safely with lots of chuckles and a handful of belly laughs. There were pockets of insight sprinkled throughout--especially in dealing with the dead-end of indecision that some lives take after college, and in the economic crisis of the late Reagan era that resonates with what we are going through now.This is Greg Mottola's next film after his breakout hit ""Superbad,"" and thus audiences are likely to draw comparisons. Already I can tell you the general consensus: ""Superbad"" this is not. I'll admit that Superbad also had a rather formulaic premise, but something in the execution of that film puts it a few hefty steps ahead of this one. As I said before, there is nothing wrong with ""Adventureland."" It just doesn't stand out as really all that excellent. It hit all the notes, just not as hard as it could have. The acting, while good, does not have the charisma of the Michael Cera & Jonah Hill duo (though Bill Hader re-teams with Mottola in a consistently funny role as the manager of the park). Nor is the romance completely fresh: despite good actors and realistic portrayals, it seems to fall into some of the old genre favorites--the inevitable fight followed by the inevitable reunion. You know the deal.But taking it as its own film, ""Adventureland"" isn't bad at all. It's worth watching, perhaps even in theaters. It's a good date movie, though not one that you'll remember vividly in the years to come.

""Adventureland"" is one of the finest examples of coming of age films where James starts as a teenager and ends up as an adult. His transformation is highly visible and trackable by the audience. In his summer job he meets with new people, makes friendships and witnesses the realities of life which basically shapes his development and ideas. Despite his weird family, James keeps on track and manages to survive in all the U-turns he faces during his three months in the theme park. If you are familiar with coming of age films, you should know that nothing really happens in the means of story or action. This kind of films have an intense focus on the protagonist's complicated emotions and reactions to his environment and how he is shaped by these, on the road to adulthood. ""Adventureland"" focuses on more than one character's inner self and all those characters are somehow connected with each other either by friendship, love or hate. In this point of view, director Greg Mottola does a great job. While he is knitting the story with his characters, their lives and problems, he does not exaggerate and takes a sane and believable road which creates credibility for ""Adventureland"".The summer was not easy for anyone in the film but they managed to create strong bonds which will turn out to be fine memories in their future. Those memories help audience to show empathy for James, Emily (Kristen Stewart) and other characters in the park because the lives of those people used to be our own experiences once upon a time. Maybe not all but some of the things have happened to us on our way to adulthood. This is how the film creates credibility in our eyes.Even though ""Adventureland"" is a story of young adults, you are not going to find non-sense sex related jokes or aimless conversations like the director's previous film ""Superbad"". When you look in the poster of ""Adventureland"" you will see a sentence saying, ""From the director of Superbad"" but comparing ""Adventureland"" with ""Superbad"" would be a very big mistake. I think the only common point of those films is the young adults. Mottola shows two difference faces of American young adults in these films.The story takes place in 1987 but most of the time during the film you don't really take notice of this fact. Except maybe for the cars and clothing styles. Jesse Eisenberg is an excellent choice for a sophisticated poet-like character like James Brennan. As for Kristen Stewart, she is completing the main character but I haven't felt any chemistry between Stewart and Eisenberg. It might be because of the acting style of Kristen Stewart. She is playing one certain role in all her films. If she would have gone out to meet Edward Cullen during ""Adventureland"" no one would have been surprised. Because she is basically still the same boring character. However, her boring style as a young adult matches with the mood and the purpose of the film. One of the strong points of ""Adventureland"" is that the story and the characters are calm - maybe except for Bobby (Bill Hader) - and this calmness is transmitted to the audience as well. This helps audience to be a part of the film. Here, Greg Mottola does another excellent job. I should praise him for his full control over his film both as a director and writer. ""Adventureland"" manages to give audience a cultural reference of 80s in America because the story is loosely based on a period of Greg Mottola's life.A smart conversation or a concern of one of the characters are all about ""Adventureland"". This calm story is also decorated with equally calm and relaxing soundtracks with the simple set-up of the year 1987. I have found peace in the stories of those characters and therefore enjoyed ""Adventureland"". Once again this is a highly recommended down to earth film for those who would like to have a look at their earlier lives.",Adventureland
114,razzakahmed,An above average love story,6,12 June 2021,"It's a love story . . With a lot to learn and so my rating would be 6.5 . There's an amusement park called Adventureland .. two friends meet up . With a bit of natural twists and turns here and there in the story . The best part is the parents interaction towards their children .. and the amusement park backdrop really looks nice. It's just a little above average love story, with toooo many kisses . . Honestly 🙄 .. the intensity of the scene should deliver it rather than just the lip-locks, you can't make success through sex or lip-locks .. Jesse Eisenburg from Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice, Ryan Reynolds from the Green Lantern, and Kristen Stewart from Twilight fame take their roles respectively .. it's funny and good 🙂",Adventureland
115,oscarxp25,Roller-coaster of Love,8,7 April 2009,"""Adventureland""- ***1/2 BY: Kevin Muller The marketing for this film is terrible, just absolutely awful. The studio is pushing this film as the next ""Superbad"", just because the director of that film directed this gem. The truth is, this is far different than ""Superbad"", besides a few gross out gags. Where that film prided itself on its crudeness and vulgarity, this film prides itself on heart and pure emotion.""Adventureland"" has the feel of teen movies both from the 80's and 90's (more the 80's though). You have a sensitive character who is still trying to figure out who he is, and by a sequence of events, falls in love and more importantly, finds his true self. What makes the movie even more appealing is that it not only doesn't treat its characters as generic stereotypes, but as humans, which makes them more appealing to the audience.Our main character here is James (played perfectly by Jessie Eisenberg) who has just graduated college and is looking forward to his trip to Europe with his fellow pal. The trip is not only supposed to be his graduation present, but also a way to escape his recent heartbreak, due to an emotional breakup. Things unfortunately go south with his finances, which forces him to get a job at the local amusement park. There he meets some interesting people: the two owners (Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig), nerdy Joel (the likable Martin Starr) and the beautiful ""Em"" (Kristen Stewert).James and Em quickly fall for each other, but there is one small problem, she is in a very dysfunctional relationship with Connell (Ryan Reynolds), who plays the married park maintenance guy. Reynolds, who usually adds the goofy humor to every film he is in, holds back to really give the character a deepness that I was surprised he pulled off. I thought his performance was going to be similar to his Monty character from ""Waiting"". I applaud the restraint that he held throughout the film, because the character could have gone down that route very easily.What makes this film work though is that director Greg Mottola doesn't overdo any aspect of the movie. The comedy, drama, and situations are all well balanced, which makes the film feel real. As I stated before, Reynolds is grounded, as is the rest of the cast with their performances. Eisenberg, who is accused of playing Michael Cera, gives a very layered and human performance. I am sorry to you Cera fans, but the awkward and caring guy thing was around way before Cera did it. Stewert, is just perfect in this role, she gives Em vulnerability, but makes her lovable at the same time. These two give perfect performances because neither of them have all the answers and it is about the deep connection they share, not just about the sex.Go see this film, it deserves to be seen. This is a movie that Hollywood doesn't make anymore; a sweet, smart, moving and humorous experience that hopefully starts a chain of movies like it to follow.",Adventureland
116,bonsai-superstar,A Great Date Movie,7,13 July 2009,"The plot was not much to speak of - no twists and fairly predictable. For a comedy, the laughs were good but few and far between. Why then the 7? Well, I'd even give it a 7.8 if I could. This movie perfectly captures the feeling of being young and in love. Kristen Stewart, full of weird tics in Twilight, is here utterly believable as the cool love interest of Jesse Eisenberg. The latter, while playing basically the same confused kid he played in Rodger Dodger and The Squid and the Whale (both great movies in their own right), is not surprisingly also good at his role. The supporting characters also have their own charms and there's really no weak point there.If I have one complaint, it's not with the movie proper. It's that I totally relate to Eisenberg's character as well as his musical taste (""Satellite of Love"" is one of my favorite songs) as well as Stewart's: I love Husker Du and the Mats), so I kinda resent that it's cool _now_ to be like him or like that music. Nobody knew who they were then.Ultimately, both guys and girls should enjoy this movie. Not only a cut above most teen flicks, it's also a strong romance. Well done.",Adventureland
117,omahonyjason,Brilliant film - Hilarious but Super Sweet!,7,7 September 2009,"I like my comedies to be brash and brilliant. I like to laugh out loud and SUPERBAD (2007) ticked all those boxes!It was directed by Greg Mottola and I laughed my head off, so I was really looking forward to his latest, ADVENTURELAND. I expected it to pick up where SUPERBAD left off. And it does, sort of. The film is screamingly funny in parts but there's also a wonderfully bitter sweet nostalgia to it. It strikes me as being a far more personal film, presumably because Mottola writes as well as directs.The movie is set in 1987 and is all about James, played by Jessie Eisenberg, who was meant to be having the summer of his life. He's just graduated from an English degree and is off to the prestigious Columbia University to do a Masters. He was supposed to go backpacking across Europe with his buddy for the summer, but then his Dad got a drastic pay-cut and so he's stuck working a dead end job in a crappy run-down amusement park, called Adventureland. Horray for him! He learns a lot about vomit, corn dogs and why college is essential to his continued survival.There is, of course, a really pretty girl who works 'rides', rides are far cooler than games, by the way, so James is stuck in games. But the pretty girl, Em, played by Kristen Stewart, who ya just knew was going to be an absolutely massive star since her small role in Sean Penn's INTO THE WILD (2007), isn't quite the girl next door. She comes from the wrong side of tracks and doesn't exactly have a stellar record in relationships. But she does have an eye for James.Bill Hader, who appeared as one of the cops in SUPERBAD, absolutely steals the show again as Bobby, the manager of Adventureland. To him managing Adventureland is not just a job, it's an Adventure and his scenes are the hands down funniest parts in the film.ADVENTURELAND is a wickedly smart comedy that manages to mix intelligence, humour, nostalgia and comedy to wondrous effect. It's got a thumping soundtrack and belts out the hits from the late 80's, with pride of place going to Falco's Rock me Amadeus. Genius!And while it's rude and raunchy in parts, it has a heart of gold. The scenes are achingly sincere and wonderfully capture the melancholic emotions of early adulthood while also doffing a cap at the drink-fuelled chaotic madness of youth. The dialogue is brilliantly written, the characters are wonderfully played and the situations are seldom less than hilarious.There's an awkward honesty to the film that is, at times, almost embarrassing but the lead actors are so wonderful to watch that it's never less than super sweet, without ever being saccharine. I went expecting SUPERBAD and while this is never as laugh out loud funny, I absolutely loved it! It's a brilliant film. Hilarious but super sweet! Catch it if you can.",Adventureland
118,Boogalow,Awful eff-fest,1,20 August 2010,"Maybe I don't get it but does this really have to be littered with the F word all the way through it? Even the obnoxious motherf***** is in there. It's described as a 'delightful comedy' but it isn't funny with all this bad language, it's unnecessary and spoilt the movie for me. I turned it off after an hour hoping it would improve, but it just got worse. I only watched it for Ryan Reynolds but he was wasted in this, loved him in The Proposal - now THAT's a delightful comedy, but Adventurealnd sucks.This business of having to have ten lines of narrative is also a waste of time IMDb! Perhaps if someone has something to say which doesn't need 10 lines then that should be allowed, otherwise, just like this extra narrative AFTER the review is just meaningless words to take up space.",Adventureland

120,lndkramer,Why???,1,20 April 2009,"I've seen plenty of ppl go over why this movie wasn't good, but I'm just so bothered by all the ppl who loved it that I had to add my opinion in.I'd like to start by saying that this movie is nothing like the classic Superbad. Only thing in common is the Greg Motolla the director, Bill Hader, and Jesse Eisenberg acting just like Michael Cera. Almost too much like him. I can't figure out how he was getting that much action. Weird.The movie is not funny. No laughs, just one or two chuckles. Very misleading. Just like Nick and Norah. Boring. An hour and a half that felt like three hours. No suspense or wondering because you can see exactly what is about to happen. Dumb cop-out ending. And they were at an amusement park. That seemed like a cool concept, but nothing was really done with it. Ryan Reynolds I think was also a little out of place. Not bad acting, just not him maybe. There were even scenes when peoples hair was different between shots. This is a B movie at best. Which is not a bad thing, but it doesn't live up to the hype behind Superbad or any other teen film we've seen lately. Don't bother with it. Wait for Funny People with Sandler and Rogen to come out, or go see I Love You Man.By the way, why the hell do ppl think that Superbad takes place in the 80s???? Did they have Nextel phones or porn sites back then?? Plz pay attention when you watch a movie you guys.",Adventureland
121,tappingjeff,"Adventureland With Nostalgia and Heart, But Not Much Chemistry",5,15 August 2011,"A rip off an 80's teen comedy, that kind of throws in the 80's simply for nostalgia's sake. I enjoyed the premise, and found it to be typically cliché at times, with some really nice moments here and there. It's the usual story of kids struggling to make money and struggling to make love, with James (Jesse Eisenberg) getting a job at a theme park and falling for Em (Kristen Stewart), a fellow employee. Conflict comes when they both get involved with other people and lose sight of what they could have had with each other. You can guess the ending. It's got some funny moments, and the performances certainly stand above general teen comedies. There's no chemistry, however, and throws in a bunch of characters without much payoff for any of them. The film introduces a lot of conflicts but doesn't feel that it needs to pay them much attention either, with family dynamics and friendship troubles hinted at, but never really explored. I like the direction it was trying to take, I'm just not sure screenwriter-director Greg Mottola could steer it all the way. SNL vets Kristin Wiig and Bill Hader were a highlight though, as usual, but sadly their time on screen was about the only time that I felt the comedy. C+",Adventureland
122,Jbrown0170,HBCU247.com,6,13 April 2009,"I now know to take From the directors ofwith caution, because this movie was not as funny as Superbad. This movie had its laughs, even though I expected more because it had Ryan Reynolds and had the Superbad director. Not to say Adventureland isn't worth the watch, I just don't want you to expect Superbad comedy. The movie is pretty easy to follow. Boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy winds up in a love triangle. There are a few funny characters, like the managers, Bobby (Bill Hader) and his wife Paulette (Kirsten Wiig). This movie is set in 1987, so watch for some goofs, for example, a 2000s Pennsylvania tag versus a tag from 1987. Or at a bus stop you see a more recent Nissan Altima. It's a good movie, and fun to watch with its own sense of humor. So go watch the movie.you'll definitely find something in the movie to make watching it worthwhile.",Adventureland
123,SDAim,"Nobody said ""Right on!"" in 1987 . . .",2,11 July 2010,"This film really didn't do much for me -- a few good laughs here and there, but I generally found it to be pretty slow and a waste of some fairly decent actors. Thank goodness I actually worked at an amusement park in the summer of '85, so I could, at least, find some humor in the choice of settings.I'm just wondering if it bugs anyone else as much as it does me when filmmakers try to set something in the '80s and then blow it on the costuming, hair, dialog, and general vibe of the film. I was so distracted by the obvious failed attempt in these areas except for a few characters that I really had a problem focusing.For example, nobody really had the look of Kristen Stewart's character in '87 -- she looks completely contemporary. As I recall, most of us had bangs, and mousse or styling gel was usually involved. We also wore makeup. She just didn't look believable -- especially for a sexually active teenager in Pittsburgh who would tend to be trying to look a little older anyhow.Also, Ryan Reynolds' character at one point says ""Right ON!"" to someone the way people started saying it over the last 10 years. Some people said it in a different way in the late '60s or 70s. But I guarantee you nobody was saying it in '87 -- especially with that inflection. Huge, glaring error.The director was born in '64 -- so he's the right age to be catching these things -- don't really get why he didn't.",Adventureland
124,Ankhenaten91,A great idea poorly executed,5,24 February 2011,"First let me just say that this genre of film is one of my favorites. The coming of age film is so wrought with relatable material it is perfect to be filmed. This, however just misses the mark for me.Jesse Eisenberg is just your regular average college age guy in mid-80's America, he likes good music, a beer and to get a little high with friends. He isn't athletic or rich but is smart and is a likable character. He gets a job in Pennsylvania over the summer to make some money and this movie follows his interaction with the people at Adventureland.If you want an in depth review let me spare you now and say that this isn't it. What I want to focus on here is very specific.This movie has so much potential, so much opportunity to be good, really good. The cast is pretty strong and even Kristen Stewart does fine here.Kristen Stewart is one of those actresses you like or you just don't. I however think that she is acceptable and believable as her character who is young and dealing with what young women in that stage of life deal with.The thing that bothers me here is that the direction is so weak, that it allows the movie to waste it's screenplay and takes what could be a fun and interesting slice of 1986 and makes it listless garbage. Like a Judd Apatow movie it is too long and needs about 20 minutes cut out to tighten it up. There is no direction in the movie, no point really to speak of and so when there is nothing to build up to you need a really strong script to keep the audience interested. This however does not happen.I wanted to like this movie, I really really did but it just falls so flat and is so boring that at the end of the day there isn't anything there to grab on to, no emotional connection or direction. A noble effort but a failure.",Adventureland
125,chains01,Adventureland,8,14 May 2010,"James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) has just graduated from Oberlin College with a degree in Comparative Literature, and is planning to take a month off to go to Europe before starting grad school at Columbia to study Journalism when he finds out from his parents that he will not have the money to go to Europe. So in an effort to make money during the summer before moving to Columbia. While there he falls for a free spirited girl he works with, Emily Lewin (Kristen Stewart).Greg Mottola hit the big time as a director when he stepped up to adapt Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's script for a little movie that became Superbad for producer extraordinaire Judd Apatow. For his followup to that movie, Mottola decided to write a semi-autobiographical story of his life working at Adventureland on Long Island in New York. What was advertised was more of a comedy in the vain of Superbad, but what was delivered was a coming of age love story.In reality, I think I am more happy now that I know that the movie is a coming of age love story rather than the raunchy comedy. The movie more or less defies convention, as it's main character, James, is a virgin not looking to have sex for the sake of loosing his virginity, but rather looking for his place. The fact that the main character isn't your typically sexually charged male nerd is, in itself, refreshing. And unlike most comedies of it's ilk, this movie is less concerned with punchlines as it is with developing it's characters. In the end, it's still the characters that make the movie, not the other way around.The acting in this movie is great. Jesse Eisenberg, unfortunately seeming to be more and more typecast, still does the geek chic thing very well. Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, of course being SNL alumni and at the top of the current class, bring the funny. Martin Starr plays the conflicted friend Joel, a character not far off from his character in Freaks and Geeks, while Ryan Reynolds gives a performance that is very understated for his typically more flamboyant style. Kristen Stewart was the real surprise to me though. For most of the movie she really seemed to be just swimming through, but toward the end it really seemed as if the character bared her soul, and she did a great job at portraying that.If there was a flaw in the film, it wouldn't be with the film itself, but rather with the advertising that made the film seem like something different than what it is. In actuality, that advertising short sold the film for those of us that would have been more interested in the actual finished product. I highly recommend this film for anyone who likes dramedy's and if you like movies that really let you into the film characters lives.4/5",Adventureland
126,demaym,Adventureland was worth the wait,8,8 August 2009,"After months of waiting for a copy, I finally got to see the movie last night, and I must say - It was worth the wait.Adventureland is a rare type of comedy, for our day and age, in regards to the fact the humour is subtle, and the drama is powerful. Rather than relying on slapstick comedy and toilet humour, Adventureland chooses to focus on its characters with depth, and the superb writing, and direction, ensures that the movie will have you smiling consistently through out.Some are saying that this movie is not a comedy, and I disagree. The film is very funny in places, with Jesse Eisenberg playing a terrific lead, backed up with subtle comedy gems by Martin Starr, Bill Hader and Kristen Wigg. Kristen Stewert was overly impressive as the female lead, and it was refreshing to see Ryan Reynolds in a non-generic, and non-clichéd, role. The supporting characters were also great, with Margarita Levieva as Lisa P standing out.With a near 2 hour running time, packed with drama, lust, and some laughs, Adventureland is no 80 minute slapstick fest, and this might be hard to endure for the average laugh out loud type of comedy fan.You could watch this film with your friends, you could watch this film with your partner, and you could even watch this film with your parents - Adventureland is a great all rounder.One of the better comedies of the last decade, and yet another gem to come out of the, ever growing, Apatow clique.A solid 8/10 from me.",Adventureland
127,dominicpearson,We've seen it all before but...,7,1 January 2010,"Teen angst comedy dramas are not exactly hard to come across but finding one that stands out from the crowd is a difficult job! Adventureland nearly hits the heady heights of (500 Days of) Summer, Napoleon Dynamite and Juno but doesn't quite make it.As you'll no doubt be aware the action takes place in the late 1980's in the eponymous adventure park. James (Jesse Eisenberg) has graduated college and soon discovers his father cannot afford to put him through grad school so, for the first time in his life, he needs to get a job. This means going to the one place he can get a job. We're soon introduced to the normal band of cool kids, quirky adults, geeks and freaks and so the story starts! I've read some comments on here that the characters are unlikeable. I do not agree with that at all. In fact the only unlikeable character in my opinion was Ryan Renolds character and that is only because he was taking advantage of his position with the young girls.The story has the normal ups and downs, will they/wont they, yes they will but not without adversity and the eventual breakdown/reconcilliation but it is the performances and characters behind the normal template that impressed me.I can see how a lot of people compare Jesse Eisenberg to Michael Cera; both have a certain amount of awkward charm but the character of James seems to be much more well rounded and worldly. His nervousness is backed by a confidence, although I know how contradictory this sounds! I quite liked him and the assured way he conducted himself, although I can see why he is more of a games person rather than a rides person! I have not watched the Twilight films (and do not intend to) so this was the first I have seen of Kristen Stewart. The loss of her characters mother and the replacement step mother loom large over Em's life and she is looking to rebel and escape all at the same time. Stewarts portrayal of someone clearly in pain and who is crying out for help but looking in all the wrong places was very believable and genuinely moving in parts. That she has already made the mistakes when James walks into her life and cannot stop herself continuing these is even more heartbreaking. I can see why people would not empathise with her or like the character she is playing - her actions are those of a bitch but scratch the surface and there is a decent and caring person there.What I particularly like about the main characters is that their flaws are clear to see. James' jealousy gets the better of him and he purposefully aims to sabotage Em's character towards the end of the film. Em herself is, at times, selfish and childish and is knowingly sleeping with a married man. But these are the flaws of the young and, in broader terms, humans in general. The film does not back away from these and is all the stronger for them.The supporting cast all play their parts well. The comedic value offered by Frigo and the park owners is a nice balance to some of the more emotionally charged scenes. I laughed so hard at when James finally got revenge on Frigo! They made the film a well rounded, well scripted and well acted one.The other thing worth mentioning is the soundtrack and cinematography. They capture the time period perfectly and you can escape back to the 1980's (if you really want to!) Having said all of this there is still something missing. We have seen it done before and better. It is for this reason alone that I have not marked it higher.To conclude, then, if you are a fan of the zany, slightly left field, coming of age rom com akin to those named above this is a must watch for you. For everyone else this a well written film with nicely rounded characters and a familiar story and worth a watch.",Adventureland
128,airguitar57,Fun and familiar just like Adventureland,7,19 June 2010,"Do not let the trailers fool you, Adventureland is not Superbad, but this isn't a bad thing. Written and directed by Greg Mottola, the director of Superbad shows that he is great when it comes to directing comedy, but only OK when writing it. Although the story is often predictable, the film is enjoyable and succeeds with moments that actually made me laugh.Set in the summer of 1987, Adventureland shows James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) who has just graduated college with a degree in comparative literature. James has plans to tour Europe with his college friends, something that his parents have agreed to help pay for as his graduation gift. Unfortunately, his father has recently hit a snag in his career and they can no longer afford the trip. With his summer plans ruined, and his future as a Columbia grad student in jeopardy, James is forced to go on the hunt for a summer job. Being deemed unqualified for everything, including manual labor, James is forced to take a job at nearby amusement park, Adventureland, where his ""in"" is a friend with a love of punching him in the balls. The rest of the film follows his summer as a games operator, as he finds friendship and love in the company of stuffed bananas and pandas.Adventureland is funny, but it's that muted underplayed humor that elicits gentle chuckles rather than a hearty guffaw. Certain repeating jokes, the aforementioned ball punching, tend to overstay their welcome, although the ball punching joke does have a funny final moment. The film seems to be trying to get us to laugh, but the moments just aren't there. The directing and acting sets up moments that with better writing would be hilarious, but you can't squeeze water from a stone.The acting is pretty strong throughout. Eisenberg seems to be doing his best Michael Cera impression. It may not seem fresh, but he manages to make it work. I wanted to hate him as the bumbling intellectual youngster, but he is honest enough in his work that I found myself believing him. The main love interest is played by Ms. will-never-live-down-Twilight Kristen Stewart and she plays the typical Kristen Stewart role, brooding, complicated, deep, so damn emo and yet still cute. You've seen it before, and chances are you'll see it some more, since she has become a bit of a hot commodity. While at first I was down with Stewart, liking her in Panic Room and Into the Wild, I've grown tired of her constant lip biting and nervous hair touching. I don't think she's necessarily a bad actor, but she is so deep into her pigeonhole that I just want to see her do something different. The best parts of the film aren't in it enough. SNL members Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig play the owners of the park and are absolutely hilarious. The two have so little screen time but bring so much to the characters that they become fully developed. They have moments that are so subtle, but when noticed, bring so much, I don't know whether to credit the actors or the director, either way it is great.By setting a film in any time other than modern day, especially the 80s, some end up shoving the period down our throats. This film manages to fit its period but not leave the audience screaming, ""I get it, people dressed horrible then"". The setting and the story are also treated with enough care, that despite their faults it's hard to hate them. It's no surprise that Mottola wrote the script based on his time working at the actually Adventureland in New York. This isn't just a script that's written to be funny, rather it's written to reminisce on the experiences of yesterday.For some reason Adventureland was marketed as a raucous coming of age comedy, most likely to capitalize on the success of Superbad, and that is too bad. The film is not a crazy comedy, but it is a good one. Mottola does create a believable and often humorous film that is understated while being a bit more serious. At the very least, it is worth seeing just for Ryan Reynolds as an unlikeable character. The story is predictable and not always funny, but Adventureland is still a good time.",Adventureland

But beyond that point, he's just annoying. No, I'm not talking about the character in the movie: I'm talking about Jesse Eisenberg.

What seems to be a measly job will change his life forever.Adventureland has your usual coming-of-age drama formula: an unusual premise, an unique aesthetic, and a soundtrack filled with indie sweethearts mixed with oldies-but-goodies. Some movies may fail on the execution, but not with this one.The movie takes a realistic approach with somber tones, taking on life problems that may hit too close to home, and handling on issues that are authentic without glamorizing them. The performances brought out by the main characters are top-notch. The soundtrack may sound pretentious, but just the right amount of pretentiousness, as the songs really brought out the heavy atmosphere the movie intends to show.Some subplots may deemed unnecessary, and the plot may dragged on a little bit, but it was an enjoyable experience. I was a bit confused as why it was tagged under a Comedy genre, as the jokes are spread thinly across the movie.A perfect movie for teenagers and adults alike.",Adventureland

Jesse Eisenberg is great in this Michael Cera type role. Martin Starr from Freaks and Geeks is always great to see. Kristen Stewart gives another performance where the less she says the better she is. That's not to dis her talking, it's just that her whole persona is so evocative. The girl who plays Lisa P is great. She looks like Eliza Dushku's younger sister.Great music used throughout. Yo La Tengo did the soundtrack, which is worth an 8 all by itself.Highly recommended.",Adventureland

The average teens in this movie were completely unrealistic in terms of their musical and cultural knowledge and awareness. They didn't even play anything that was popular in 1987. Rock me Amadeus would have been overplayed in 1984. But at that time it would have been dead in the water by 1987.No kid had a pacer in 1987. I was 17 in 1987 and though I'm appreciative of Brian Eno, The Replacements and Big Star now, at that time I had never heard of any of them, and certainly knew no one who would have that as their record collection with a slacker loser going to University (a character who never existed at that time) complimenting a hair-twitching slut on it.",Adventureland
135,celticjunkie,Really takes me back....,8,2 September 2009,"This film really took me back to another time and place. This was nostalgic for me because I grew up in the 80's and went to the real Adventureland, in Farmingdale, NY (on Long Island), and could easily imagine the characters and scenarios really happening. Well, maybe the park managers (Hader and Wiig) were a bit over-the-top, but the rest of the characters could have been my peers. And the real park is waaaaaaaay smaller than Kennywood, where this film was shot. The park guests were a bit more ethnically diverse in real life, and the throngs of day campers weren't depicted in the film, but much of the rest rings true. I loved the clothes, the music!!!!, the lack of cell phones and texting so rampant among today's youth, the 80's dance moves, etc.This is a bittersweet story of a young man getting a bit of a reality check when he is forced to get a summer job in order to save money for graduate school. Fresh from the heady world of academia, he meets a slightly different crowd than he is accustomed to.Jesse Eisenberg -- wow, he looks so much like his sister -- he is perfectly cast in this film, as is Kristen Stewart. These characters are complicated and layered, and these actors do not fail. Worth a watch, you won't hurl from the spinny rides, and you'll get a chuckle. If you are over 35, you'll appreciate this even more.",Adventureland

I've seen a lot of teenage movies in my time and to be more honest I was expecting to see a boy meets girl, boy falls in love, falls out of love, big heart rending scene at the end etc etc... Adventureland is all of these things but it's done with a moody intensity that bely's it's young actors ages. Kristen Stewart excels as the moody damaged teen stuck in a mindless job, with a relationship that has no future. Ryan McFarland plays the geeky slightly bemused new guy who joins a run down theme park, which seems to have an unerring ability to attract customers despite the crazy lunatic owner (Bill Hader) and the unenthusiastic staff.The only downside for me was Ryan Reynolds, who seemed to play the married ""boyfriend"" of Em without any passion and you soon get the feeling he's only there to pick up a pay cheque... Perhaps that was the intention, but going from the intensity of a character like Em to the ambivalence of Bobby didn't seem to fit...All in all a thoroughly good movie, geeky, funny, sad...no surprises on the ending which coupled with Reynolds character gives it an 8/10.",Adventureland

Over the entire length of its duration, there are literally two jokes worth laughing about. The rest is sheer teenage boredom, spiced up - I have to admit - with the pretty solid performances of Eisenberg and Stewart. Other than that, there's nothing new to this picture, it's just pointless in its shallow depiction of the gloom and frustration of young age. If the film had been advertised in a different manner - according to its real theme - I wouldn't have gone to watch it. It's a drama disguised as a hilarious fun fest. Not amusing, to say the least. And pretty boring on top of that. If you want a good time at the movies, stay away from this downer!",Adventureland

I've personally worked at a theme park before my first year of university and it was pretty spot-on. We goofed around a lot, the managers were chill, we would hang out after work, and nobody really took it seriously. Kristen Stewart does a great job of playing that troubled, angsty persona. She's quite beautiful as well. Eisenberg plays his classic awkward role and it works very well here. The romance is believable, dialogue isn't cheesy, and the overall vibe of the characters and their actions are pretty realistic.

Who did he know in movie industry that he got that role?This whole movie is one big messy hodgepodge of a dish with all the naive notions of modern ""teenagery"" blended with political correctness gone awry as its ingredients. And why do I have a feeling that the writer is still a confused teenager?Just about everything in this film was awkwardly wrong and anti-artistic; whether it is Bill Hader's fake moustache or Kristen Wiig's typical nervous mumbling style of dialogue, or Kristen Stewart's burst to defend a Jew by comparing his rights to those of gays.Here is another question. Which group of people is more vulnerable to hatred in today's North America, Homosexuals or Jews? Found the political insanity in that whole scene?

It's often simultaneously funny and touching. The casting is damn near perfect, if not perfect. The set, the 1980's, is far from cheesy and is very authentic without screaming,""THIS IS THE EIGHTIES."" It's almost criminal that Greg Mottola's Adventureland wasn't a bigger box office hit due, in large part, to confused (is it Superbad part 2?!) marketing. Mottola's eye for casting is amazing. Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, and Ryan Reynolds were cast as the leads before each of their careers skyrocketed. The three are more than solid in their roles as the awkwardly earnest James, self-loathing and grieving girl-next-door Em, and the caddish Connell. Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader, and Martin Starr's characters are great comedic relief and solid fleshed out supporting characters. Adventureland is a must-see and a well-crafted period film that is preserved through several viewings. There are numerous one-liners and vibrant ideas and emotions expressed by the cast that anybody could relate to. It's an excellent coming-of-age film to be sure.",Adventureland

He meets a girl there, and much drama ensues.The two leads are both awesome. I've only seen Jesse Eisenberg in Zombieland before this (his two characters have very similar personalities) but he did pretty good in both. I also have an extreme soft spot for Kristen Stewart (since LONG before Twilight came out, mind you) so the movie gets some auto points for that.The plot, while not bad, is pretty clichéd. Boy meets girl. Boy thinks he loves girl but there is a lot of drama and obstacles between them. Social fallout occurs. Many people get hurt and boy & girl get separated. They eventually reconcile. I called it almost the instant the movie started.It has a pretty sweet soundtrack, but since the movie brags about it on the cover (which is pretty rare) I would expect it to be.Overall ""Adventureland"" is alright, but it's nothing special. Again, the plot is pretty clichéd, and for a 'comedy' it isn't very funny.Final Score - 6.5/10",Adventureland

Instead what I got was melodrama about teen love mixed up in several tawdry affairs which included a cast of barely enjoyable characters who all seemed quite miserable. Special recognition to the director for making party scenes and marijuana scenes boring as hell.Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig and Ryan Reynolds were criminally underused. Their scenes were top-notch hilarious but too sparse to give credit to the movie in which they take place.The only really good stuff took place inside the park.I leave with this question.

144,raiderdan-48491,Could have been better.,6,22 March 2021,This could have been a classic if not for a vapid performance from Stewart(as usual) and the oozing arrogance of Eisenberg. I am ready for Hollywood to be done with both these overrated actors.,Adventureland
145,groovybabe1992,Misleading trailer but a cool film to watch.,8,14 March 2011,"First of all, I am going to describe Adventureland as one of the best coolest comedies that I have seen for a while.The plot is about a guy called James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) who is a recent college graduate, who plans to spend summer touring Europe. His father is demoted, so James starts working at a local amusement park called Adventureland. When he starts working, he meets tomboy Em (Kirsten Stewart) and his roller-coaster ride when at Adventureland becomes the best ever summer.Firstly, this film is bubbly and full of fun. It is also a enjoyable teen flick and I enjoyed it as I am a teen as well.The characters do well in the film, Jesse Eisenberg playing James is great and he was good in Zombieland before this film. Kirsten Stewart who is known as Bella from The Twilight Saga films and I thought that she wasn't going to be good at different roles. But after watching her in the film, I underestimated her and I think she is a good actress.Ryan Reynolds who played Connell also did a great job playing the type of character who is dark as a married man but portraying as a big love cheat as well. Also, we don't see him as one of the central characters which is OK as the film concentrates on Jesse's and Kirsten's characters.The only problem that I saw was that I thought the trailer to the film was poor. It didn't saw the main storyline and it didn't show the plot very well.As I say, don't judge a film by its trailer. Go and see the film before you make judgements.Overall, Adventureland provides an original storyline, a exploration of young love, brilliant and provides plenty of laughs.I'm giving Adventureland an 8/10.",Adventureland
146,queerever,"Terrible, terrible & more terrible",1,26 September 2010,"If not for the soundtrack, this film would have had absolutely no substance, (even that, it abused). Without some of the music, I certainly would not have watched it all, & I NEVER turn off a film; my mind is too open. Is this how you want/ed to come of age? Loser! Coming of age films are generally bad; very bad ideas based on the worst aspects of US culture. And this was probably the worst coming of age film that exists. Of course people adore it - it's dressed up as everything it's not. Are you really that simple? The boring premise that yet another ""nerdy"" kid is oh so good, even his flaws are adorable (NOT), while everyone else around is either a lackey or more profoundly flawed. I have Jewish blood, mother's side too, and as a young idealist, I took offense when Marlon Brando made his famous Jews in Hollywood criticism. (NB. I took offense as an anti-racist, not due to some weak blood connection). It's not that I'm not an idealist any more; it's just that I've gradually seen more & more of the trash that gets made due to extremely indulgent, PSEUDO (or worse)/ NOT intellectual Jews, parading the most irritating affectations AND LAME STEREOTYPES, known to man, (at least to god-damned BOURGEOIS man). This film was the most irritating, sometimes painful, I can remember. Write me off as a racist, pseudo-intellectuals always do, (in general that is, not particularly w/ me, doofus). I almost never go on rants about Jews, but let's face it; in Hollywood a Jew needs less notions of the real world, less humour and less intellect to ""stun the masses"" - using tired tricks (as this film is full of) and the broad ($/ publicity) media support, which this film absolutely undeserved. Saying nothing of the HORRIBLE, lead ""actors"". That Twilight chick is the least attractive of all, current babes in the spotlight. She is a TERRIBLE actress; the same, lame affectations in front of vampires as in this movie, as in EVERY screen moment she ruins. Most of you are unaware, but she is there because Hollywood must always have its whiter than white people, to encourage the world to . . . well, be whiter. That may wash in Twilight, but is far less credible & far more unattractive, here. And he really is a pathetic, tenth rate Michael Cera, (Cera's affectation IS reasonable & slightly agreeable), yet this snivelling Jew, once again . . . I cannot hold my tongue because he is there (heard of nepotism? looking after your own?), this film exists, it gets funding and lots of money to ""propagate"", solely due to Hollywood's unbalanced, Jew bias. I'm sorry, but being Jewish, I understood only too well, the manipulative and not so smart, purported intellect that this nasty film utilised. There are many intelligent writers, actors, Producers, etc., and many of those are Jewish too. However, none of them seemed to be working on this waste of film, time and space. (One exception and NOTE, the biggest dick in the film - at least at the end with the 'shed a light on love' joke, Ryan Reynolds was also the stand-out actor, DESPITE such a crap role). Oh yeah, ""jokes""; the timing and scripting was horrendous throughout - NOT ONE MOMENT HIT A BEAT in 100-something minutes!!. Funny? I laughed 2 or 3 times and only because I WANTED to enjoy it, I really did. Maybe not the worst film ever, but certainly the very worst of its genre or type.

148,jonnygs,Adventureland,6,29 March 2009,"Greg Mottola's film, Adventureland, strives to be an entertaining, funny and heartfelt film about a recent college graduate who, through some miscalculations and bad luck, is forced to take a summer job working at a theme park, aptly named Adventureland. The film starts out a little slow, and many of the scenes that are featured in the trailer are placed together in the beginning. The audience gets a general sense of who the characters are and why the main character, James, must take this terrible job. The script, written by Motolla, is often sharp and funny, and the characters are believable, even though most are two-dimensional. For the majority of the film, it is runs from being funny to very funny, thanks to the antics of Bill Hader and Kristin Wiig, who partially steal the show. The rest of the Adventureland is serious and emotional. The tightrope between comedy and drama is a difficult one to walk and many of the dramatic scenes come off as forced. The director, Motolla manages to show the awkwardness of the main character to great effect. Unlike many teen comedies, the producers let the writer, who directed Superbad, take the helm. Motolla doesn't simply turn the camera on, but knows how to mine for laughter, and how to direct actors into giving realistic performances. From the direction to the cinematography to the editing, the film is well made. As with all films, it is the acting that ties the whole thing together. Kristen Stewart gives the best performance, balancing humor, sadness and anxiety well, and creating the deepest character in the film. Jesse Eisenberg gives a strong performance and is successful in making the audience forget that he is acting. The rest of the cast all gives good performances that make the film feel realistic. Yet the film cannot escape the fact that it is, in essence, a fantasy. For someone who apparently has so much trouble with relationships (he is still a virgin), awkwardly talking about classical novels and old girlfriends while on dates, he becomes involved with two beautiful girls that are obviously out of his reach. It's not like his character experiences no conflict, there's plenty to go around, but it all works out in the end. In terms of the plot, it is predictable and traverses the road most frequently traveled. He doesn't get exactly what he's looking for at the beginning of the film, but (surprise) what he finds as a result of his summer is what he really wanted all along. It is through what should've been the worst summer of his life that he finds the path his life is going to take. Adventureland manages to be a funny and entertaining, yet shallow, film that leaves you smiling, and at the same time wondering about the film's missed opportunities to be anything but forgettable.

The entire movie also seems like a lot of stitched together plot pieces and sometimes became random. One of the things I noticed was is that after watching the movie at this sneak preview I went to, I saw the funniest parts in the advertisements on TV. I'd never seen the advertisements before this movie, but just watch them and you'll be alright. It's one of those movies. Acting isn't great, but the kid from Freaks and Geeks is in it, and that was cool. The main character acts a lot like Michael Cera, but he isn't. Don't take your girlfriend to it, the love story plot is depressing the entire movie. Don't take your guy friends the love story is depressing the entire movie.

Anyone who claims she can't act must not have seen this.Jesse Eisenburg playing James also does very well in being one of those smart, funny, intellectual types who at the same time doesn't talk down to people in a condescending way.And may I say bravo to Bill Hader and Kristen Wigg who had just the right comedic timing. Martin Starr also did surprisingly well as someone who knew where his place was in the world.Adventureland has the right balance of drama and comedy so you're never left feeling bored.

154,main-38,"Public Enemy said it best, Don't Believe the Hype",3,5 April 2009,"Let me start by saying that just because a movie is set in the 80s and provides some form of nostalgia for the time period, this does not make it good. While 'Adventureland' creates the atmosphere very well with appropriate music and attire, it does nothing more.What is the directors affinity for stuttering, blundering and awkward protagonists? That was my primary issue with this poor excuse for comedy. James (Eisenberg), as a character, is boring. He does nothing but fidget and mutter from start to finish. Em (Stewart) is not much better. When she is not biting her lower lip and trying to act disturbed she is just making the on screen romance unbelievable. The scenes where they fight and the very end are both laugh out loud funny, but not for any of the right reasons.The supporting cast provides little support. I felt Ryan Reynolds was, at first, cast as something more than a lustful deviant. But, by the end of the film his character just comes off creepy. I kind of liked Joel (Star) but the character was not used to capacity at all. I am in utter shock he did not return to Adventureland with an assault rifle and mow down the entire cast for their idiot romances.The only aspect of the film that did ANYTHING for me was Bill Hader. He played the role he was given to perfection. Was that mustache real? He and Kristen Wiig are very weird and I kind of like it. They really don't do much for me on SNL.Overall, I guess I just expected the raunchiness of 'Superbad'. I really think it would have been much better that way. If you want a movie which dissects the prangs of working a monotonous and unsatisfying job you might as well just watch 'Clerks'. At least Dante can finish a line with out looking at his feet and trying to hold back a foolish grin.",Adventureland

It's at heart a love story to be sure. In fact, I rarely laughed in this movie. However, I did appreciate the more thoughtful dialogue, which is funny in its own way.Ryan Reynolds didn't make much sense though in the role he played. He was the biggest name in the film, played a bit part, and was not funny (which he typically is funny).One off part I saw was many of these kids behave like teenagers are expected to behave...but they are all college age students. In particular, the two main characters are both ready to go to Grad school (so probably 22) but have very naive characteristics, like you would expect from characters like the ones in Superbad.It doesn't mesh well with the proposed idea that these are mature characters with deep sense of values, which they all reveal they are at one point or another.That being said, the story arc is very good, it's told very well, and the movie doesn't come across boring or slow in nearly any part I can detect. There's a sense of finding true love and perhaps the awkward youth we all experience.I'm out...I can't believe some reviewers length here. Are you getting paid?

One clear issue I have with embracing the former perspective is that the characters themselves are hopelessly exaggerated. The likable nerd, the philosophical jew, the femme fatale waiting to be rescued by true love, the sexy gum-popping lipstick chick, the bald mother-in-law witch, the lets-hit-each-other-in-the-balls jokester, the queer folks running an amusement park... The only character which has a slightly surprising side to me would have to be Connell, who is an adulterer and liar but still manages to be a likable guy, and garner some sympathy when he doesn't rat James out. So you construct a story that has not much originality over any other romcoms, cook up the characters out of the usual rather one- dimensional repertoire, then try to be more realistic and life-like about their dialogues? To me, this ended up being neither fish nor fowl.Still, to some degree, I can't help but succumbing to the romantic summer fair attraction of Adventureland, its crew, its atmosphere.

The conversations with their unfinished sentences, over-emoted thoughts, confusion, and complexity are accurate representations of America teens. The odd, often hilarious situations mix well with the dialog and create a movie that sustains its humor throughout.Ryan Reynolds in a non-comedic role establishes a solid character whose charms and faults contribute to clarifying the storyline. Mr. Reynolds, who is so very good at comedy, demonstrates another aspect of his talent in this film through his quiet but determined depiction of a young man who is basically a good person but still manages to bring a lot of conflict into his friend's lives.The other actors also give solid performances. Jesse Eisenberg, as the virginal hero with great ambitions for both his personal and professional life, is confronted with disappointing parents, hapless bosses, hypocritical adults, and unstable peers.

I was expecting some Eisenberg fast talk and Stuart wooden acting in an R-rated comedy, but it was actually pretty low key slice of life film about a college graduate (Eisenberg) who has to work a crappy job and finds summer romance at said job (Stuart), along with the realistic fun that they get into with their friends and coworkers. It's not a masterpiece of cinema, and the best age to watch this is early-mid 20s (anything younger and they won't get it, and anything older and they will no longer get it), but it's got charm and is really a ""this could happen"" sort of movie. Plus, it has what is essentially an ""all star cast"" (even if some were before the big hits or right after they started gaining speed).And if the ""R rating"" is a turn off, it's a pretty soft R, for language present but not in excess, marijuana alcohol use, and some suggestions at sex. It's kind of in the realm of The Breakfast Club. This isn't ""we earned our R rating and we're going to let it be known,"" it's more of ""well to tell the story we wanted we needed some more adult content, just missing the PG-13 mark.""",Adventureland

What makes the film truly worth it is Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg. Both actors exemplify the new ""cool."" Something almost trademarked by Micheal Cera. It is great story, with complicated love matters and summer relationships. It had great over-the-top funny moments without being gratuitous (are you reading, Ben Stiller?)

160,OtherBrotherDarryl,I Love the '80s,9,5 April 2009,"And I loved this movie.I grew up in the '80s, and have always had a fondness for the decade. So much so that I've always thought that if I ever manage to write a screenplay, it will probably be set in that era. Until today, I hadn't seen a movie set in the '80s that I really loved, unless it was made back then. I learned to love movies in the '80s, and this one felt like it could easily have been made back then. It isn't like other '80s retro films that hit you over the head with winks and nods to the quirks of that era. You won't see anyone trying to solve a Rubik's Cube while doing the moonwalk in a pair of parachute pants and saying ""totally rad."" You also won't see a Superbad retread (people have complained that the ads are misleading). There's lots of great laughs, but it comes mostly from subtle situational moments, not in-your-face punchline dialog. This is a character driven movie, and Jesse Eisenberg really shines in a very likable performance as the geekish underdog out to win the heart of the cool and beautiful but angst-ridden Kristen Stewart. Most of the performances are wonderful, but the writing is what truly makes this movie great. Some of the most memorable moments involve the dark side of amusement parks. The real Adventureland park, where writer/director Motolla once worked, can't be too happy with this film. I imagine they might want to sue, if only that wouldn't bring even more news and attention to the shenanigans that occur there. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but ""shenanigans"" is putting it kindly.The '80s was the decade where coming-of-age dramedies blossomed with great soundtracks, and Adventureland pays off in that regard as well.Motolla himself has warned: ""I hope people who grew up in the '80s don't assume it's not for them."" Those who are expecting another raunchy teen romp like Superbad may be disappointed. These ""kids"" are probably old enough to drink legally, though that doesn't appear to be their drug of choice. This movie has more in common with Almost Famous and Outside Providence than it does with Superbad, and not just because it's semi-autobiographical. Though the humor isn't quite as prevalent as it is in Superbad, I found the laughter that it did evoke to be far more satisfying.",Adventureland

First you get a look-alike for the nervous, self-conscious geek who starred in Superbad. Then you get a young looker like Kristen Stewart. Set the story in the middle of an Amusement Park filled with losers, nerds, sluts, and jerks. Soundtrack with 80's pop tunes, 70's cars(what's with the obsession with Pacers? Get over it), when you run out of dialogue have the kids toke on a joint or swig back some alcohol and make light of it even though they drive impaired in this movie which is really not funny at all and reprehensible.

I almost am upset by the advertising plan and budget the film had because if it was given enough commercial advertisement it would've been as successful as Superbad. Sadly this film went under the radar and wasn't given the acclaim it deserved. As a teen exploitation film, this movie accurately describes, interprets, and expresses the mind of a teenager and incredibly gives any teenage viewer a sense of closure. Because unlike Superbad, the characters in Adventureland are easy to relate to and are more vulnerable in an emotional sense. Anyone who sees this film to relax and enjoy a bit of comedy with a heartfelt story, or to reminisce about their teenage years, their first jobs or their personal time at Adventureland, or even to watch a teenage love story will get what they were looking for.",Adventureland

She needs to lay off the grabbing her hair bit. Kristen Wiig- even just standing around doing nothing- is funny.

Whoever wrote the movie was not English, otherwise the movie would have been sarcastically funny.The best cast member was probably Kristen Stewart, she provided the closest thing to laughter for me. She had a few one liners but even though were amateurish.Ryan Reynolds was the biggest let down for me, he is normally very funny, but this just wasn't the same.Americans would love this movie as it provides very mild sarcasm and as Reginald D.

165,MW32,Just mediocre,5,6 January 2010,"Adventureland is neither as good as the fanboys claim nor as bad as some of the semi-illiterate posters here say. It's just a mediocre coming-of-age movie, which unfortunately seems to think it's smarter than it really is. Just because you mention Melville and Horace does not mean you are an intellectual with something deep to say. It just means you took a couple of lit courses and remembered a couple of things. (Although, in the 21st century, that qualifies you as smarter than 75% of moviegoers.) Clichés abound in Adventureland, from Em showing how wonderfully good-hearted she is by criticizing a girl who won't date a Jew, to every single adult in the movie being a fool, to the nerdy guy who hasn't had sex yet, to a romantic meeting in the rain.... Once again, the fact that this thing is hailed as a good movie shows just how lousy most movies are. Admittedly, it tries to be more than a dumb teen movie, but trying does not equal success.",Adventureland
166,PeachyPies,A love story told in a complete unique way.,7,18 September 2009,"I don't know whether I love this movie because it is so depressing or if I hate this film because it is so depressing.My initial thought was that this movie was a comedy about a kid who needs extra money and therefore ends up getting the worst job ever. I also thought it was set in the modern era (it's not, its set in the eighties). However, this film is completely different.The film begins with your typical sweet geeky guy, James, (I'm surprised Michael Cera didn't get this role) being dumped after a twelve day relationship. He thought he was in love. His friends came up with a theory that the reason he was dumped was because he told her he was a virgin (he has a tendency to tell the truth). He then also finds out his father has lost his job and his parents won't be giving him anymore money for College, so he has to get a job. He has no real experience and his qualifications don't matter much. This results in him getting a job at Adventureland as a games keeper. The most boring, pathetic and unrewarding job ever (you don't even get freebies). The only person who seems enthusiastic with anything that is going on in the park is the boss, Bobby (Bill Hader). Whilst working at the theme park, he meets some strange, but wonderful people including Em (Kristen Stewart), the girl he falls in love with, Joel (Martin Starr), a geeky guy who can't find love, Lisa P (Margarita Levieva), the girl all the guys want and Mike (Ryan Reynolds) the rock band failure who everyone wants be (who is having an affair with Em, making things a little complicated).The story is that James (Jesse Eisenberg), has fallen for Em, your typical ""girl next door."" She seems mysterious and holds a lot of pain within her. Her mother died and her father marries a woman who is the step-mum from hell. To get out of the house, she works at Adventureland even though she doesn't need the money. To control her emotions, she goes to the one guy who will always have her, Mike, who just so happens to be married. Then James comes along and changes her world because she realises what it is like to actually be loved and having someone care along about you and no one else. However, Mike gets involved and tells James that he shouldn't just focus on Em. This results in him going out with Lisa P, making all the other guys jealous. When everyone finds out that Em is sleeping with Mike, she quits her job and James has to convince her she is not an awful person and he really does like her ... a lot.This is a beautiful love story told in a dark and depressing way, but sometimes love is just like that and this film shows that perfectly and the ending is the cherry at the top of the cake. It finishes the story perfectly.When I heard Kristen Stewart, I was not enthusiastic after her dull performance in Twilight. However, I loved Kristen's character, I love the story that was behind her and I think Kristen told it well. The character bottles up a lot of her emotion, and this is hard to show to the audience, but she manages it and when that bottle opens up, it shows that Kristen is capable of being a good actress. The acting by Jesse Eisenberg was really good, I like him, but I couldn't help thinking Michael Cera all the way through the film. I think the actors that outshine in the film were Bill Hader, whose character is hilarious, and Martin Starr. They play their character roles perfectly. However, I thought Ryan Reynolds was there just to get the film known as he is a well known name. His character should have had more; it had the possibility to be excellent. Another thing that I think they could have developed on was the character of Em. I think the pain of her character should have been shown more and yes this may make the film more depressing, but it would have given this film real emotion. I really did like her character.The humour in the film isn't exactly laugh out loud funny, but the wit is there and is throughout the film, which gives it something special.To conclude, I actually still don't know whether I love this film or not. It is something different to your normal teen love comedies and I think it is worth the watch. It's enjoyable to watch.",Adventureland
167,dr_brendan,Advenutreland has a misleading trailer problem,9,6 April 2009,"Do you know that feeling you get when you've been lied to about a movie. A while back when In Bruges came out, the trailers pitched the movie as a wacky, Guy-Ritche-esquire, comedy with midgets and whores. Imagine the surprise of most of the movie goers when they went to see this film, and it turns out to be a very dark comedy, written about a suicidal hit man who is know facing regret and depression in the worst vacation spot ever. This feeling of surprise can sometimes make or brake how a movie is received for some people. Most of the time the audience will walk out of the film thinking that they've been lied to just so they will have payed for a ticket and other times the audience realizes that, if the movie wasn't pitched to them as this picture that they've seen before, they wouldn't have seen the film in the first place.This is how I felt when I left Adventureland. Let me get this out of the way, Adventureland is NOT A COMEDY. I know the trailers pitch it as one, the director says it's one, and under the genre section of IMDb it says 'Comedy. But, this film, honestly, has two jokes in it, most of them supplied by Bill ""By God You're In Everything Aren't You?"" Hader. I'm not saying that this film only has two jokes in it like there are a lot of jokes in here but they're not funny. I'm saying that they're are only two jokes. Yes, Adventureland was pitched to us a romantic teen comedy about a horrible summer job but instead the film is a romantic drama that focuses on 21+ year old, coping with the fact that life is in fact full of sour lemons and you need to take a horrible job because it's the only thing you can do. I too was surprised that Adventureland wasn't a comedy but once you get past that, the film is actually very enjoyable and turns out to be one of the most intimate romance films on the same scale as 'Once.'The film centers around the double named protagonist, Brennan James. Who is a couple thousand short of the money he needs for his trip around Europe as well as the first couple months rent for when he starts going to school in NYC. His parents inform him that his dad has been demoted and he's gonna have to pay for the money himself. The only job that is still hiring is the seedy amusement park Adventureland where all of the employees do nothing but talk about how much their job sucks, smoke weed and get drunk during their shifts. Brennan-James falls in love with the smart-dangerous girl, Em. But due to his drug connections, the hot girl of the theme park starts to become attracted to him. A love triangle turns into a square, then a hexagon and soon just a big pile of mess.The film itself could go for a very whimsical style here due to the amusement park setting but because of the directors previous works (Freaks and Geeks and Superbad) he decided to go for a super-realistic approach. I also feel like he chose to direct this drama because he wanted to expand himself as a director. The direction itself is pretty subtle, which is for the best. I was really engrossed in the script itself and I felt like any ""special"" work the director put in it might have taken me out of this twenty-something romance story.The story is a very good one. This too goes for the extremely realistic approach. Watching this film I remembered all of the times I had experienced something like this with a girl and that's when I realized that the film had totally sucked me in. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen to Brennan and Em and once their relationship hit a couple of big rocks I remembered all of the times I had nearly ruined my relationships by doing something stupid. (i.e. listening to my penis and not my brain)I was worried about the acting at first, it has a newbie as the lead and the twilight girl as his love interest. Not to mention Ryan Renolds playing a mentor figure, one that is a couple of cockiness points away from being the one in Waiting. However the director must have worked his magic with these three because they display some of the best performances I've seen in a while. They emote, they repress, they do everything a real person does in a relationship to the degree where their characters are so well developed your rubbing your eyes in disbelief like some kind f college screwball comedy. Then again, realism seems to be the thing Adventureland seems to do be going for.This film is trying to grab the attention of the forty-somethings that were twenty-somethings in 1980 by making the most realistic nostalgia trip I've ever seen. The costumes seem like they're right out of value village, the dialog seems like you could have said it today and the acting makes the characters seem as if they're real people.If feel that Adventureland wasn't pitched to the audience as a dramatic look at young love during the backdrop of the late 1980's because in the latter part of this decade, the only way young people are willing to look at the 1980's is through the eyes of irony. Looking at hot new styles as stupid idiotic fashion choices. Adventureland looks past all of that and makes a film that seem to be a grown up Sixteen Candles and because of this new approach to a beaten down idea, I not only applaud this movie but recommend it to people who have been looking for something new.",Adventureland

170,B_D,Boring and Cliché,2,15 April 2009,"I'm not the type of person to walk out of a movie - in fact, I've never done it - but Adventureland made it a challenge to stay in the theater in a way that few films do.Let me preface this by saying that I hadn't seen any previews or heard much about Adventureland, so I wasn't expecting a Superbad-esquire romp like many other reviewers apparently did. I didn't know whether I was going for a comedy, a drama, a coming-of-age flick, or what. I had an open mind, willing to accept whatever I saw, and yet I was incredibly disappointed and confused by the end of it.Adventureland suffers from having an incredibly cliché plot, the standard awkward boy meets troubled girl fare that we've all seen hundreds of times before. From early on in the movie, I was able to figure out exactly where it was going, and at no point was I thrown for a loop. Everything proceeds according to genre conventions. There is nothing new or unexpected here. Additionally, there is a strange fatalistic tone that pervades the movie that manages to be overly serious and depressing without being at all deep.None of the main characters are in any way likable or believable. A large portion of the plot revolves around the difficulty that Jesse Eisenberg's character (James) has expressing his affection for Kristen Stewart's character (Em) and attempting to make the relationship work. I guess this was supposed to be a meaningful story about two misunderstood college kids trying to reach out to each other and looking for love in all the wrong place, blah blah blah. Instead, James comes off as a boring, awkward guy who becomes infatuated with the first girl who gives him any attention; Em never rises above our first impression of her as a cookie-cutter troubled teen who keeps James around for his good weed connection. Because of this, I couldn't bring myself to care about what happened to either of them.Too much of this movie seems to be an attempt by the forty-something director Greg Mottola to prove that he can still seem cool to today's youth. The characters are constantly smoking weed (okay, we get it, they're cool, introspective kids!) and dropping stereotypical lines to bring attention to it: ""This is some GREAT WEED James"" or ""Man I am SO HIGH."" For some reason this is set in the 1980s, I guess for some sort of faux-cool retro feeling, or maybe just so people can namedrop Lou Reed every ten seconds. Unfortunately, the setting was terribly executed: half of the characters are wearing trendy American Apparel fashion, and Yo La Tengo's recognizably modern score is jarring when juxtaposed with famous 80's tunes.Overall, Adventureland fails on almost every level. The comedy? Terrible. The drama? Played out. The characters? Boring. The acting? Meh. The setting? Poorly executed. Avoid this movie, I don't know how it is getting such good reviews.",Adventureland
171,daverdinj,A bunch of hipsters looking and acting like hipsters but pretending to be in the 80s,2,28 March 2012,"Eh. It was very disappointing. A bunch of pot smoking college grads haven't progressed past their teen angst days. Oh, and I guess it all happens in the eighties.There were a few subtle clues to the eighties thing, such as the cars and a few pop culture references, but other than that I would have not known the movie was supposed to be set in the eighties had I not been told this by outside sources. I would have just thought it was a tale about modern day suburbanites-gone-hipster.Hipsters like to sport 80's fashion, listen to 80's music, live off of their parents and smoke pot. The movie constantly played every big hit tune from the eighties, just like lots of movies with modern day hipster appeal set in contemporary society.So what about this movie makes it an 80's era film? Oh, I see- it's eighties era simply because it proclaims itself as eighties era... ...just like a hipster.And the waste of talents such as Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader is shameful! Their presence gave an unfulfilled hope that this movie would be a lot more fun that it actually was, but Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg came back to remind us that Wiig and Hader were just used decoys for the dry, gloomy, semi-funny feeling the film preferred to fixate itself on.",Adventureland

How in the name of all that is holy can they take a great setting like an amusement park and end up with such a slow, lame, awful movie? I was ready for a comedy but would have accepted a dramatic love story. Instead, I sat through nearly two hours of really painful cinema. The writing was poor, the plot predictable, and it hurt to watch it. There was very little character development and very little was believable. This movie had no idea what it wanted to be and just wandered all over the place, but at least it was excruciatingly slow. Let's see- confused kids, obligatory scene of prejudice (anti-semitism, which is always popular with Hollywood), adultery and lots of alcohol and drugs. It was like watching someone run through a checklist.My wife has vowed never to allow me to choose our movie again because of this and I can't even argue with her.The only think I am thankful for is that I saw it on TV and only paid $5.99 instead of $30 at a theater.",Adventureland

Yes it is a coming of age formula film and nothing in the basics of the story to lift it out of that but the observation and dialogue and the acting make it incredibly authentic and brilliantly funny.Some people complain about it being labelled a comedy, saying there were no laughs in it but I laughed out loud frequently- funny dialogue and scenes bordering on slapstick.It was also very romantic and i would have to guess that the reviewer who did not find Kristen Stewart attractive at all must be dead.",Adventureland

And there was a bit of that in this movie and it was funny and reminiscent of that kind of work--the kind that builds character, or whatever. But what really dragged this movie down for me was all the drama over the relationships in the life of Kristin Stewart's character. She hated her father for dating a woman she hated. Well, so what, move on, girl. Parents are free to choose their partners and children don't really get a vote in the matter, no matter the age or maturity of the children at the time of the parent's selection. And then, and remember this was supposed to the Eighties when people of that age revered all things YUPPIE, her character was sleeping with a guy who drove a DUSTER. Did any college babe in the Eighties do that? Maybe, but it took more imagination for me to believe that than it did for me to accept that young Captain Kirk could be exiled to the frozen tundra of nearest planet and conveniently land within walking distance to Spock's cave in that Star Trek movie. And the irony is that if they movie had been topical, not based in '87, it would have been understandable why she gravitated toward a dude with a Duster.

Personally, I wanted to watch this film after I found out that Kristen Stewart played a key role in it. I'll admit that my girlfriend got me into the whole Twilight ""craze"", and after seeing the movie, I desperately wanted to see Kristen play another role, as recently as possible. Curtain's up on ADVENTURELAND! So at first, when I was watching the movie, I made all of these comparisons to how she acted in Twilight, and of course how she acted in Adventureland. Her style of engaging the audience in her airy style of conservatism was present in both films...but the role she played was VASTLY different, a literal 'opposite-end-of-the-spectrum'.I gave up comparisons between the two movies about 20 minutes in, because you see...I was completely wrapped up in the storyline of Adventureland. I just settled into my nice comfy, reclining theater seat and enjoyed the rest of the movie.It tells the basic story of new experiences, finding oneself, and of course...the timeless tale of falling in love. The movie itself is quite comically entertaining at times, but was overwhelmingly a romantic drama. The attempt at mixing the two is the epitome of the late-teen, early twenties youth mindsets throughout the world...even today.All in all, I'd completely recommend going to see this movie. Just do yourself a favor when you go: don't hold the movie up to any other standards, just sit back and enjoy it for what it is: an 'against-the-odds' love story.Cheers.",Adventureland

Not only are all of the characters he meets at the park unique and complex, the plot twists and turns. The outcomes of this film are not predictable or like a ""typical"" romantic comedy. The ""pretty/popular/stupid"" girl is not portrayed in the usual cliché manner; she is not mean and does not break up the main characters. She is a real person. Same with the character of Connor (Ryan Reynolds' character), who could have made to be a disgusting pedophile, but instead is given a personality and complexity.

179,guyrowlanduk-1,The Cameron Crowe movie that Cameron Crowe never made,10,4 May 2018,"Simply wonderful. Adventureland is a gem that completely passed me by on release, but am beyond euphoric to have discovered via the gift of Netflix.Yes, the spirit of Cameron Crowe is all over this, even down to the Paul Westerberg songs. And of course I mean Cameron Crowe at his fearless, heartfelt best, that mainlining of music and young love in Say Anything, Singles or Almost Famous, anchored and rooted in a particular place. And what a place Adventureland is, where Falco blaring 20 times a day tortures the downtrodden staff, all marking time listlessly waiting for something more interesting to happen to their lives. And of course something interesting happens to them as they wait.Every cast member earns their place without a foot wrong really, but of course special praise has to go to Eisenberg and Stewart. And especially especially Stewart, 100% believable as damaged but never playing the victim, beguiling while never being cute. All of which would have counted for little had Motolla's script not been so sharp, never over-emoting, flirting with and enjoying genre cliches here and there but never at the expense of succumbing to the inevitable. Oh, and the end credit song was the most perfect choice in a film full of them.This is a film to treasure. Looking at the rest of Motolla's resume, this is likely to be his career highlight, the personal film he protected from all sides. A true cult classic.",Adventureland
180,pbangel4u,Exactly what you would expect from BLAH characters,4,24 December 2011,"As always Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart were depressed. It seems they couldn't show any positive emotions even if they tried. I feel that every time I watch one of their movies its hard to tell if what's being said is supposed to be a joke or not because they show no emotion!!! I was hoping with Ryan Reynolds in it he would bring his usual charm but unfortunately that was not the case. Not a fun movie. Just sad and not in a touching way. More of a what is the point of this movie and when is it going to end way. There wasn't a single character I really cared about, nor did I feel like there was a message. So All in All. My personal opinion is to pass on this movie. Maybe if its on TV or your streaming it on netflix, check it out just to base your own opinion but I would not recommend paying for it!",Adventureland
181,damien_27,Endearing and Understated,7,8 April 2009,"Adventureland is not a film that is going to wow its audiences with big laughs or A-list talent. While the film is slow and predictable, it manages to please on many levels. It's refreshing that Hollywood is willing to release films that provide more than just trite sentiment regarding youth relationships. Adventureland is genuine in its approach.The film details the life of a young college graduate over one summer in Pennsylvania. The central protagonist has a plan with what he wants to do with his life, just no current means of getting there as fate would place many obstacles in his path. Sexually immature, our hero meets Em, played by Kristen Stewart. Em is a classic girl next store type with endearing qualities. She cares for our hero as much as he cares for her. However, love never proves that simple.Adventureland will appeal to many film purists as it is a good example of quality writing and acting. The film was perhaps mis-marketed as Greg Mottola is credited as the director of Superbad. The film is not Superbad, while similar in some ways, it's a stand alone piece. View Adventureland with an open mind and you should enjoy.",Adventureland
182,weirdestwolf,Adventureland- A sweet and all around satisfying comedy.,9,27 July 2010,"I look up to Kristen Stewart as a person, so, of course, I like to see as many of her movies as I can. So, when I found out about this film, I sent it straight to the top of my Netflix Queue.What I found when I watched the film was a sweet comedy about teenagers growing into adults, and a comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously. With Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig as the not so subtle comic relief, what wasn't to love? Jesse Eisenberg's acting, from what I've seen, has always been spot on with a bit of awkward comedic effect to lighten up the show. And, of course, it was great to see Kristen taking on a bit of an edgier character than her movies in the past.It was refreshing to have seen a movie so simple in its message and plot- though it has a lasting emotional effect on me, I seem to have trouble as I write this review to think of things to say. So I'll just end it here- great plot, great cast, great movie. I'd recommend this to anyone (aside from young children, the f-bombs were so numerous that if someone actually bombed a city with them, no life would be able to survive within a hundred miles of that city for another five hundred years.) So, in short, just see the movie.",Adventureland

184,tbchico7,Damn good movie,9,11 July 2013,"This is perhaps the best comedy I've seen in years, and it isn't really even a comedy. Sure, it has some good jokes and funny scenarios, but at it's heart, Adventureland is a love story, and a very good one at that.Set in the summer of 1987, we follow Brennan (a typical Jesse Eisenburg character), a high school grad looking for a job to pay for an apartment and a trip to Europe. He is overqualified for manual labor, and finds himself working at an amusement park known as Adventureland. It isn't the most original idea, and not much about the film is particularly unique, but it has taken, I think, all the great aspects of teen comedies and romances and honed them into a well made, peak-of-the-genre film.The supporting cast is extremely likable, which amazed me since I hadn't liked a single one of these actors before. Ryan Reynolds is a maintenance guy/musician who is popular amongst the young women at the park. He is the closest thing to an antagonist, but isn't really that bad. Bill Hader was excellent as the owner of the park. He is so over the top, especially when chasing people with a steel bat. The biggest surprise was Kristen Stewart, who really blew me away. I can't say I don't like her since I haven't seen the Twilight films, but I've been told that she is absolutely awful. Not from what I've seen. Her character ""M"" is someone with a lot of depth and soul. she is so easy to like or hate. Not perfect, but understanding and extremely well acted. One scene that best displays this is when she confronts the girl who had just put-down one of her nerdy friends. I couldn't help but smile.I can't think of another ""comedy"" with this much heart, or where the characters are so likable. Don't go by the trailers, and certainly don't pass it off as another dumb raunchy comedy. it's not.",Adventureland
185,fitzpatrickjd,Blah on top of blah,2,23 March 2021,"Jesse Eisenberg & Kristen Stewart are the same as they are in every single movie. So if you're big fans of them, this is for you. And if not, then definitely avoid.
Absolutely no humor from Ryan Reynolds in this- or anyone else- which is too bad, because that's about the only thing that could've saved this overdramatized & boring film.
It's 90 minutes you won't get back.",Adventureland
186,raj_apart,Amazing character development!!,8,8 August 2009,"Adventure was projected as a raunchy comedy (at least, I envisaged it that way from the trailers and promotional material doing rounds). But, it's so much different from an stereotype teen-comedy or even a light rom-com rhetoric. It turned out to be a drama which provokes you think deeper about the routine facts of life. How you need to fight, how sometimes you loose, deal with it and move on. It makes you realize that you must accept defeats in life and never let it grow on to you.The characterization of everyone, specially the lead pair, is pretty deep and distinct. The character grows on you, so much so that it keeps you interested and linger on as the movie proceeds. Jesse Eisenberg plays a goofy and suave boy who aims to get into Ivy League journalism. Kristen Stewart plays a girl who is confused, wanders off aimlessly, but has a distinct charm and obscure kind-heartedness. But, Martin Starr, who plays Joel, is amazing and keeps you longing for more of his funny-self.Overall, a swell movie!! Just don't go, expecting it to be a Teen-Comedy and you'll like it just fine.",Adventureland
187,abruptlyperfectowl,7/10,7,18 April 2009,"I went into this movie last minute with a friend of mine. A couple of folks I talked to had disliked this movie and a couple enjoyed it so I figured I would just have to wait and see for myself. I had previously enjoyed Superbad but it's not my favorite so for those of you out there reading this, the above statement should provide some more context.In short, this is a very enjoyable movie that is quite funny at times with some very good drama mixed into it. It has a consistent tone and the entire flick does a good job of capturing the types of experiences that all people have faced during their dead end summer job years.No real complaints here. I did not rate it higher because while I did truly enjoy it, it did not really leave me wanting more. It did not really leave me with any feeling other than, ""yeah, that type of stuff happened to me, but it's all in the past now"".7/10 for being a very true movie.",Adventureland
188,nextbesthing10,"good movie, in my opinion.",8,25 September 2009,"I thought it was a great movie in the terms of storyline and how it was made. the only bad part was the main character. To me he just sounded like a stammering idiot. He would rush all of his words and pause between outbursts of word vomit, it just took me out of the movie a little because I was getting annoyed. I really liked the camera-work that was done on the bumper cars scene, and the soundtrack is incredible, not to mention incredibly perfect for the movie. The Em character was very good, especially the interactions between her and the step-mom. Frigo was a hilarious character, thinking about his one liners now are making me giggle like a little girl.",Adventureland
189,Jgordon96,Kristen Stewart stole the show again.,10,26 May 2012,"Okay, i really really freaking loved this movie. It was everything i bargained for, it was hilarious, but also dramatic and emotional. Kristen Stewart sent shivers down my spine during the break-up scene. Her gorgeous light green eyes stood out so much during this movie. This movie is officially one of my all time favourite's. There's lots of great laughs, but it comes mostly from subtle situational moments, it just all meshes well together and very naturally. This is a character driven movie, and Jesse Eisenberg really shines as the likable and relatable awkward teen James. Nerdy and dark humoured, he is out to win the heart of the cool and beautiful but troubled character Em - Kristen Stewart. The plot is great, the movie is more than meets the eye on the previews, i like the movie way more than the trailer. This deserves much more attention. Recommend this highly to those of you who enjoy light hearted comedy, excellent acting, drama, down to earth characters seeking freedom and of course anything Kristen Stewart. This is a 'DO NOT MISS'! Trust me.You also won't see a Superbad retread (people have complained that the ads are misleading). There's lots of great laughs, but it comes mostly from subtle situational moments, not in-your-face punchline dialog. This is a character driven movie, and Jesse Eisenberg really shines in a very likable performance as the geekish underdog out to win the heart of the cool and beautiful but angst-ridden Kristen Stewart.",Adventureland
190,dingram-1,"Despite a solid cast, a flaccid flop",2,3 September 2021,"Great cast, but this is a soundtrack in search of a plot. And dialogue. And direction. The movie seems more a platform for someone showing off their hipster music 101 credentials than anything else. Nothing new here. Two stars. And that is because it is a great cast. But if you want to see a teen flick where the cast, dialogue, plot and music merge together beautifully, watch clueless.",Adventureland
191,trapuniversebusiness,Great movie !,8,7 September 2018,This movie is incredible. Although the crowd they were reaching for wasn't much other than people that like the 70's and/or people who like romantic films that have strong male leads. Depending on what your past consists of this film will put you in a deep mellow state of mind when dark moments are shown. But on top of everything the movie is an emotional roller coaster mainly because of the music. The soundtrack is incredible. This movie is worth your time if you are in adolescent years!,Adventureland
192,Sumbudy,A nice little coming of age tale that's not the teenage romp you were expecting,7,16 September 2009,"I've seen it said that this movie suffered from false advertising, and it most certainly did. The commercials and trailers told us to expect another wacky comedy in the vein of such films as Superbad and Knocked Up! Not that I saw those movies, but when I watched Adventureland, it was because I was in the mood for something funny and for better or worse, it wasn't exactly a comedy.More of a classic coming of age type movie where we meet all these characters working at the amusement park as they are at certain crossroads of their lives. With my background and the way I grew up, I didn't exactly relate to these characters a whole lot, but it was interesting to watch them deal with the things that popped up in their various experiences.All the actors were good in their roles and the roles themselves avoided teen-movie cliché-ing. Some may have had specific quirks, but they felt like real people, not just ""the geeky kid"" ""the cool girl"" etc, etc.I can see why critics loved this thing. I thought it was well made, well acted and it did a good job of capturing it's time period (mid to late 80s) that brought to mind other movies that are age setting specific, such as American Graffiti or Dazed and Confused, and it fits well into that type of genre. Not what I expected, but I enjoyed it.",Adventureland
193,kens-3,The Post-Graduate,9,13 April 2009,"I saw ""Adventureland"" today, and I thought it was one of the most enjoyable films that I've seen in quite some time. Just the right blend of humor, and heart. It's certainly not your average gross-out comedy, no matter how the marketing is portraying it.I haven't read all the comments, but does anyone else feel that this film has a strong kinship with ""The Graduate""? After all, both films deal with a lead character who has just completed his undergraduate work, and though the character in ""Adventureland"" thinks he knows where he's heading, there's still that lost generation quality at work here. I don't know, to me the comparison was obvious, and as much as I love ""The Graduate,"" ""Adventureland"" doesn't pale in the light of the classic film. The other obvious parallel to the earlier film is the absolutely amazing soundtrack.",Adventureland
194,shawna84,Surprisingly thoughtful,9,5 April 2009,"Going into this movie, I expected what the trailers portrayed. Another Superbad-style raunchy string of jokes to laugh my ass off to. Instead, I got a thoughtful tale of first love, and the reality of being a twenty-something fresh out of college and unemployed. The movie reminded me of Nick and Norah but with more heart. The element of realism invoked is incredible. This is mostly thanks to the spot-on casting. No big names to sell the tickets, just talent. Kristen Stewart (while, once again, being the same character she is in all of her films) is convincing as the girl-next-door type. Along with Jesse Eisenberg who's relatively low-key status brings life to the story. Combine this superb cast portraying the ""every people"" (not just the 2 leads, the supporting characters are perhaps what makes this film so relatable), with a story that undeniably comes from experience, and you're enveloped in the complex relationships and dynamics of the characters. There's a lot more going on in this story than first meets the eye. Its a movie that stays with you after the credits roll.",Adventureland
195,thedude19792003,sh*t sandwich,1,17 November 2009,"This is one of the most boring, pointless movies I've ever wasted a night watching. There is little more to the plot than a dude working a crappy job and dealing with a crappy love life. If the filmmakers were attempting to illustrate what a pathetic and soulless decade the 1980's were, job well done, but my guess is they were simply trying to cash in on the success of better written quasi comedies such a Juno and the like. It's been a long time since I've wasted time on a movie that was so boring and pointless. It was billed as a comedy, and as far as laughs go this gets an F-. The acting is mediocre at best, which is really a waste considering the overall talent of the cast. There's not much hope for bringing to life a script that is truly a sh*t sandwich.",Adventureland
196,rharwoodx,"Boring, pointless, unoriginal",2,6 April 2010,"This movie had no point. I'm sorry but unless there is some sort of theme that inspires some thought or contemplation I have no interest in watching the immature love affairs of a bunch of self obsessed young adults. I watch a ton of movies and rarely do I see something as pointless as this. It pretty much was just a high budget soap opera with some 80's alternative music thrown in for what seems like no reason whatsoever. Some of his interactions with his family are amusing at the beginning of the film but those funny bits make what happens with the rest of the movie all the more infuriating. I kept waiting for something not totally predictable to happen in the second half of the movie but no such luck. I may as well have turned off the movie (I wish I had) as I didn't need to watch the second half as I already knew what was going to happen with all the characters as the all follow boring, unoriginal character arcs that all end exactly where you expect them to. Also some of the actions of the characters were totally unbelievable and they chose to do things that normal people wouldn't ever. I love absurdest entertainment, Monty Python is the best, but if you are trying to make a film in which it's only effective if you can identify with the characters and root for them as they try and overcome the trials that we all face then you have to create believable, coherent characters. The people in Adventureland seemed like a bunch of overemotional whiners who consistently over react to life's usual trials and tribulations in ways that seem motivated simply to keep the boring plot moving. Not original, passably acted, and a lame predictable ending. Oh, and last but not least I don't think I've ever seen a less realistic rendering of people smoking pot, seriously, they have to keep mentioning in the dialog that they are stoned in each scene because if they didn't you wouldn't have any idea that they were. Again, them smoking was just a pointless affectation in an overall pointless film. I can't tell why this movie was made, as others have pointed out it was probably just a film that was churned out to capitalize on the success of Superbad and they may be right. Save yourself the time and watch Superbad again, this movie sucks.",Adventureland
197,EternalFlameOfFreedom,Interesting movie,7,5 April 2010,"I'm not fan of this kind of film but for the first time this genre has something better to offer. Plot and the storyline is nothing new or different than many others but the way how they bring us this story is pretty much different since it has some deeper sensations and very good characters that are involved here.This film have romance, drama, teenagers with their grow up, first jobs, life outside school and some common things that can happen on everyday basis in that age. Even better thing is that actually this story has something good to tell to younger audience about ""rightful"" choices and friendships.Bad thing in this film is drug use among teenagers and how that part was pretty much natural in that age. Yes it is sad that kids in these days are doing that but it shouldn't be presented on screen like this, no need for more bad influence.All in all, fans of teenage films and romance should watch this since it have everything that they need. For everyone else there is green light to watch this, you will not miss something in life if you don't see this but if you have opportunity to see it, than watch it without hesitation.",Adventureland
198,Sarah269,An enjoyable film for teenagers.,8,29 April 2011,"*This review may contain spoilers!* When I first saw this film, the thing that most appealed to me was the characters. One of the hardest things in movies is to make sure that you have developed your characters enough. Especially in films like these where they are such a diverse amount of personalities experienced throughout the movie.For example, Ryan Reynolds' character, Brad receives different views from watchers. When Brad is seen having an affair with Kristen Stewart's character Em, some people may feel that he is kinda like a jerk for cheating on his wife and not telling anybody whereas people may feel sorry for him because he is probably not happy in his marriage and is a guy that is stuck in his life.Jesse Eisenberg's character, James I think is a bit confused by what love means. At some point in the film he says that he thinks that Em is ""the one"" even though it seems like he is not too sure about it. I think the problem with him is that he doesn't know who is the right one and who isn't.Kristen Stewart's character Em is not really that likable towards viewers. I heard people say that her acting was kind of dull in this movie but that is how she is probably been told to act to succeed in this role. Em is surrounded by loneliness. She feels that she sometimes needs to get away from all her troubles which is probably why she goes off with Brad.I could say loads more about other characters too. The acting I think is good as well. Jesse delivers a shy-like personality while also being likable while Ryan plays this kinda layed back cool guy. God he is so hot in this movie...haha. I love the setting of this film too. One bad point I would say about this film is that it doesn't really appeal to adults. Most teenagers are probably the ones that most like this film.Overall, a good film to watch. Funny, cool and enjoyable.",Adventureland

I believe its best hook was the cast. Great cast, but they could have pushed it all further and made something to remember. The jokes were mildly funny, the characters were all slotted, and the story wasn't all that interesting.The movie seems to stretch out longer than necessary. However, the cinematography was fantastic. Nostalgic of home for me (Old 6 flags in Aurora, Ohio that is now shut down) but it wasn't enough for me to say I -liked- the movie. In fact I was disappointed. I realize it was supposed to be somewhat of a dark comedy, but just a little more effort would have been really appreciated.Go to the cheap seats for this movie on a rainy Sunday afternoon when you're really aching for something to do.",Adventureland
200,brownsworkshop,Disappointing,2,12 April 2009,"This movie was slow and boring. I was expecting to like it, even if it wasn't a laugh-out-loud comedy. I like a good coming-of-age story, but I was surprised by how unmoved I was by it. Kristen Stewart's character seemed phlegmatic and depressed. I could not see the appeal of her, except that the main character was inexperienced and didn't know better, but the screenplay wasn't smart enough to know this was the message it was giving, unintentionally. Her character reminded me of Ethan Hawke in ""Reality Bites"" who was a terrible choice for the main character but the viewer was supposed to find him endearing. Ryan Reynolds was good. I was very disappointed in this movie.",Adventureland

When Lisa P came out I thought oh god i'ma hate this girl, but I was wrong.. and Martin Starr was such a pleasure to watch, I have not seen him in any other movies but I wish he were in more.

204,ledfloyd0906,It is a Shame,10,12 May 2009,"It is a shame this movie was poorly advertised. Personally I feel that it is the best film in the past two years. Yes I know there is The Dark Knight, Slumdog Millionaire, The Wrestler, and now Star Trek, but I haven't liked a film as much as I do with Adventureland since Almost Famous. Adventureland is more of a coming of the age of movie than a comedy if that makes any sense. I just wish this was advertised better because this is a movie I could watch over and over again. It's funny and realistic. I know it is a bit depressing at some parts but that helps make the film better I think because you really feel bad for Martin Starr when he is rejected by the red head. You also care a lot about when Eisenberg (Don't know if I spelled that right) finds out about Em near the end. This is not your average movie. You don't come across a movie like Adventureland every year. The ending was amazing, Bill Hader has NEVER been as funny as he is in Adventureland in any other film/TV Show, and Mottola really showed me that he is one of the best in the business right now. I look forward to his future films and wish that he advertise them better, and that he not put them on the same day as a film such as Fast and Furious (which is atrocious).",Adventureland

Spoilers from now on: Each character's story is glazed over quickly, then dragged out as it plays through the current time. No emotional attachment possible--and I'm the sort that tends to 'live' the movie when I watch it. Not this time. I expected the movie to center around the job experiences; instead, it is a tired, overdone ""virgin falls in love with odd girl"" story, and the park just happens to be where he meets her (and others he befriends). A few funny things happen there (at the park), nothing more. The movie seems to promote pot nearly as often as a Cheech & Chong flick--seriously, it adds NOTHING to this movie, very pointless.

206,sweetjesska,"clever, witty, and absolutely enjoyable",8,2 April 2009,"So I saw ""Adventureland"" at an advanced screening and I found it to be quite entertaining and funny with a certain ""real & genuine"" vibe. It takes place in the mid-80's and involves a college grad played by fairly newcomer, Jesse Eisenberg who takes a job at a local amusement park to save money in hope to go to New York. Though the job maybe dreary; he finds himself having the best time of his life. I personally loved how director, ""Greg Mottola"" incorporated a few clever sequences one involving ""weed cookies"" which just made it diverse to other teen comedies. The music was typical 80's which also made the movie that much more fun! I particularly loved ""Lou Reed."" All in all the story and characters were enjoyable to watch and you can truly find yourself relating to them. It may not compare to movies such as ""Superbad"" comedy wise because it is much more of a semi ""dark humor"" type reminiscent to ""Juno."" Genuinely speaking, I personally really enjoyed this movie and would actually see it again with friends at the theater for a good time, which I can't say I would for the majority of other teen comedies out there.",Adventureland
207,jrm2727,very disappointed,1,11 April 2009,I give the story a C and that is very generous. It is the same story that i have seen a few dozen times before except this time it takes place at an amusement park. but what really killed the movie for me wasn't the bland story it was the fact that you could see the boom-mic in half of the damn movie. Nothing distracts more from a movie then seeing the boom-mic hanging in half the shots. it gave the movie a very amateurish feel and made me think that the director and studio didn't really care about the final product. they just wanted to be lazy and push it out as fast as they could to beat the summer blockbuster season. a little more time in post production and the edit room would have been nice. I would be embarrassed to be associated with a movie so poorly put together. don't waste your money on this film. i contacted the studio and asked for my money back.,Adventureland

The actors are all real and wonderful. Catch this film about a guy in his summer job who falls in love. Again, nothing new but the way it's handled is why it is such a sight for sore eyes. The writing and directing is what keeps you involved in the film. Don't think it's the best indie of the year but it is definitely a must see. Jessee Eisenberg really carries the show with ease. His character is very sweet, nicely written, and entirely engaging. Some of the other characters could have been made more interesting but it doesn't really matter because the movie works.

209,drosent111,Complex and Moving,8,1 September 2009,"'Adventureland' is a melancholy voyage into the grey zone between adolescence and adulthood, school and career, lust and relationships, frivolity and responsibility. That is to say it is not 'Superbad' and that's supergood. Upon graduating, comparative literature major James Brennan is informed that due to his father's recent demotion (alcoholism is an implied cause), the parents will not be funding his planned and hopefully transformative European vacation. James returns to his parents' Pittsburgh home with virginity and intellectual pretensions intact.Still planning on attending Columbia Journalism School and needing funds, James seeks summer employment and settles for a job as a game both operator at Adventureland, a local amusement park that has seen better days. He is after all a comp lit major and not even qualified for manual labor. Of course Adventureland is more than meets the eye. We're introduced to the interior lives of park employees. Extremely powerful performances are provided by Jesse Eisenberg, Martin Starr, Margarita Levieva, Ryan McFarland, and especially Kristen Stewart as James's sort of girlfriend Em.These are not stock characters (with the exception of the ballbusting Frigo character, put here for childish laughs). The characters are emotionally and behaviorally complex. They wrestle with what it means to be young (or not so young) what it is to be in a relationship, the meaning of sex, employment, violence, drug use, fidelity, intellectualism, relationships with parents and their new spouses, the value of education. In short, what it means to be a person.To enhance its verisimilitude, the film is mostly set to mid eighties tunes (Expose, The Mary Jane Girls, etc.). These songs are of the mid-eighties, but the film is set in 1987. It's a slight jab at the less than cutting edge nature of Pittsburghian society circa 1987. No matter, the film does not ridicule the zeitgeist. Rather, it takes seriously the emotional resonance of the sex, the music, the clothes, the hair, the ganja, the drinking, and the want to all involved (it was serious) and in so doing achieves poignancy.The film touched me and not just because I was almost James's age living not too far from Pittsburgh in 1987, but because it addresses what it means to be on the shaky cusp of adulthood in such an honest way. A must see.",Adventureland

This is a film that promotes ""EXTERNAL APPEARANCE DOES MATTER"" slogan , which I think is not a good message. If the heroine in this movie was a not so good looking girl, what would have been the story like? I just can't imagine what the director wanted to convey here. The acting was below par. Sorry Kristen, you need to take up some acting lessons. On most scenes she doesn't know what to do!! whether to laugh or cry or put up an angry expression or anything else... Having said that Eisenberg did a good job. He certainly is not the good looking guy in Hollywood. But there is glimpses of a good actor in him. Ryan Reynolds did a good job too. Margarita Levieva is just too hot on screen!! So for me this movie could have been better if the director had cast a better ACTING heroine, removed unnecessary lags, better storyline. Nevertheless i do recommend this movie for a one time watch. Probably on a Saturday night with a can of beer and nothing else to do.5/10",Adventureland
211,daniel-890-135921,I Loved this movie!,10,7 January 2014,"This movie just had a feel to it I think I think a lot of people can relate to you don't know what it is but it just puts a smile on your face. Through out this movie I was routing for James and Em to get together so when thy finally did at the end I found I had a genuine smile on face and that isn't something that happens often. This is probably one of my favourite movies of all time along with ""the way way back"" which has a similar feel to it plus it has Annasophia Robb in it who is smoking hot. I've been a fan of Jesse Eisenberg from the very begging and I'd say he did a pretty damn good job of portraying his character. I think that Kristen Stewart did a good job playing Em because there were some challenging scenes for a young actor to do well. the main cast all did a good job I enjoyed all of the performances but my god was Frego a dick and when James finally got that final nut shot on him I couldn't help to think that he deserved it.",Adventureland
212,zazzy_zuzu,Most un-relatable film ever?,2,11 July 2014,How. How do people like this film? I watched it due to rave reviews and people saying it actually makes Kristen Stewart look like a legit actress for once. That is not the story my friends. She's as wooden as always! Her characters a bitch and Jesse Eisenberg plays a pathetic little whiner... I mean it's really a shame that the cast is full of talented people like Kristen Wiig - she deserved to have a bigger role and Ryan Reynolds plays a serious douche when he usually adds brightness to a film... Just a really terrible film full if boring antagonists really. How people can even compare this to the genius of Superbad I'll honestly never know. Don't watch :),Adventureland
213,southsider2000,"A Warm, Funny Exploration of Young Love and Maturation",9,10 April 2009,"Greg Motolla's Adventureland is the most rewarding type of film-going experience: a genuinely funny, heartfelt slice of coming-of-age narrative that sneaks up and lulls you into a blissful state of nostalgic joy, leaving you not only smiling well after you've exited the theatre, but also fondly remembering the tumultuous passionate journeys of your own adolescence. The film remembers a time where every night out with your friends promised a magical universe of possibilities and rapturous dreams of finding that one defining romantic partner who would ""get"" you and see through the immature goofball exterior. Watching Motolla's sweet reverie of a comedy I found myself not so much transported into the film's 1987 amusement park setting as awash in the tantalizing memories of a time which, while not long ago, seems to have mysteriously drifted out of my aging grasp.Set in the sleepy suburbs of Pittsburgh during the latter years of the Reagan era, Adventureland stars The Squid and the Whale's Jesse Eisenberg as James Brennan, a well-intentioned, funny young man who has just graduated with a degree in English literature - with a focus on the ever valuable Renaissance period - who finds his planned summer in Europe cancelled due to his families economic struggles. Desperate for money to pay his way into New York's Columbia University journalism Masters program, James, after discovering the uselessness of an English BA (I felt like weeping during these scenes), finds himself with a dead-end job as a games supervisor at the city's ramshackle, ""Rock Me Amadeus""-rotating, amusement park Adventureland. Temporarily friendless, working for peanuts and still packing a V-Card, James glumly prepares himself for a summer of toil and tedium.Fortunately however, Adventureland staffs an eccentric crew of wage-slaves so memorable that boredom isn't really an option. There are Bobby and Paulette, the owners of the joint, a deceptively insane married couple played by SNL pros Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, as well as their ruggedly handsome ride mechanic Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds), a moonlighting musician who once legendarily jammed with Lou Reed! Also present are the workplace sexpot Lisa P. (Margarita Levieva), the uber-smart, cynical nerd Joel (Martin Starr) and the... Oh, hold on, who's that cute, edgy girl behind that game counter over there? James sure wants to know too. Her name is Em (Twilight's Kristen Stewart) and she's a wounded beauty who guarantees to make James' life a whole lot more interesting. Over the course of these simmering, dreamy days of summer '87, Motolla unfolds the day-to-day dramas of these character's lives as we look on with an infectious mix of joy, hope, sadness and a heavy helping of youthful exuberance.What makes Adventureland a revelatory experience, unlike similarly themed romantic-dramedies aimed at early twenty-somethings (Nick and Norah anyone? Yeah, me neither!), is its unswerving commitment to capturing the human truth within each and every character. Em may be cool, funny and adorable, and an ideal potential lover, but she's also carrying the weight of the world on her lithe shoulders and not immune to poor judgment. Similarly, Reynold's Mike is a smooth-talking ladies man, cheating on his wife, who talks big but, at the end of the day, innately realizes that his future prospects are slim to none. A lesser film would have made him the pathetic butt of a joke, but as played by the actor and written by Motolla, he's a fragile human being just trying to remind himself of a time when the future glowed with promise. Heck, even bubbly Lisa P., goofy Bobby, meek Paulette and cynical Joel are interesting individuals with real emotions and genuine struggles to overcome.It's the love story between James and Em, though, which makes Adventureland sing. Not since David Gordon Green's Snow Angels have I witnessed a teen romance so honest, unconventional and rewarding as the one depicted affectionately here. Motolla remembers that young love is, at the best and worst of times, an exhilarating, frightening, confusing adventure which is as valuable for the passion shared as the accompanying personal revelations and growth. James and Em may not be destined to wind up in wedded bliss, but they're time together will forever change and strengthen them for the better. That both young actors communicate this chaotic ride so beautifully is a testament to the maturity and quiet intelligence of their performances.Leaving the film, it was impossible for me not to think of the Em of my own past, and reflect on how that relationship ultimately laid the groundwork for the course I've travelled on since. While I truly hope for a brighter future for Adventureland's two young protagonists, I feel honoured to have been able to follow them and rejoice in their emotional explorations. This is a movie you want to hug and treasure, a tender reminder of time gone by and of those warm summer evenings when the mysteries of the cosmos could be found in a bright smile or an adoring gaze.",Adventureland
214,kathrynbrammall,A mixed bag,6,27 June 2018,"Adventureland does and does not surprise me. I expected a somewhat normal love story of a guy falling in love with a weird girl in an unusual setting. That was indeed delivered. There were however some genuine and interesting moments, but it felt overpowered by the repetitive and overused soundtrack (if one more 'edgy' Lou Reed song was played I would have taken another star off, I swear). The editing is completely off at points, something I very rarely notice within movies meaning it really was off. At so many points there were questions left unanswered because of sloppy editing, or perhaps they really were actually relying on the viewer to fill in the gaps? But that doesn't do it for me. Overall it's not a bad movie, it's interesting and even unusual in some ways, but it tries too hard and is lazy at times so runs a little thin if you are looking for good ""teen"" romance.",Adventureland
215,leme666,Not what I expected,8,19 August 2010,"As I came upon this movie, I figured it was going to something like Superbad, at least, that's what the plot kind of pointed me at. It turned out to be something completely different, more of a drama story with some comedy twists to it.Its simply a story of a guy wanting to go college, getting a summer job and going through teenage love issues like we all most likely did.Kristen Stewart really shows her talent in this, even though her role is also very similar as to what I assume she played in Twilight (Which I haven't seen.), but its what I hear.Since the movie is based in 1987, the soundtrack is pretty great for 80's music lovers, the only thing that really bothered me, is that it didn't quite look like it was the 80's, except for a few details here and there, it could've very well been based in the 2000's.It was fairly good, I recommend it.",Adventureland
216,smilitude,"You ""should"" see it, and ""should not"" judge it.",8,11 May 2010,"I was really bored after a while - when I was seeing this movie. It felt like a boring plot about a pathetic guy - who's favorite song is ""sometime feel so happy, sometime feel so sad"". That's not something you'd want to see in silver screen. You'd want to some bright people, strong and heroic, and you'd secretly wish to be like them.But I loved the film. I loved the part when they were smoking and talking about Herman Melville and Moby Dick. And I loved the part when he said, ""hope they call me Henry when I die, too"". I loved the details of the story that has been there. That's how the real life is. And that was an honest picture of life.If you love to listen to stories, you should see it.

217,samybg,A romantic comedy you might actually relate to(if you're young and broke).,8,11 July 2009,"I enjoyed this movie, as it is a rewarding and entertaining experience for the see-all movie fans as I am. It portrays very accurately the troubles young people go through when trying to find a special person while dealing with the problems life throws at them. It stands apart from other comedies involving youngsters as it is inspired by the harsh circumstances(economic) that are leaving some of us perplex. I have always thought romantic comedies to be somewhat untrue as the main characters are usually wealthy or well-to-do. The storyline usually involves a rich guy who already is going out with a hot blond but starts having some feelings for the hot brunette... who cares, really?The funniness of the movie is direct, honest and practical at times, it reminds of Juno. There are some allegorical moments that might even bring reflection from the viewer. A great movie in the way it sketches serious issues while being hilarious. The broader audience might recognize itself in it, as I did.",Adventureland

There are funny moments in the movie don't get me wrong but this movie is not meant to make your sides hurt. What it does well in my view is portray life for someone who feels like they can't get ahead and is always just shy of making it in life finding a place where he fits in. It shows a character who has a reputation they are ashamed of finding someone who doesn't care and looks past it. This movie is amazingly written and shot and from the negative comments I have seen people wanted Superbad. This is not that and if you want to watch Superbad, watch Superbad.",Adventureland

I could relate to the characters since I've worked summer jobs in places similar to Adventureland throughout college. I found myself rooting for James and Em throughout the movie, because they didn't seem to be expressive characters except when they were with each other.

I like flashback movies, but that had nothing to do with it, other than the music. Also, they kept using slang that was very current, which bothered me even more. It might have been even funnier if they used the music from the 80's, but it was set in the present, because they kept complaining that the park played the same music over and over again.It was really slow moving, and it wasn't that funny. Plus, Kristen Stewart is so boring. And there is not enough of Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, they are awesome. Even when they are in the movie, it wasn't even their best stuff.",Adventureland

The advertisements for this movie, try to spin it off as a comedy of a boy who goes to work at an amusement park and it's just full of fun and laughter. But it's not. Not at all.

223,Mallory4587,"If you liked Nick & Norah, you'll also LOVE this AWFUL MOVIE!!",2,25 April 2009,"AWFUL MOVIE. Literally filled me with anger. I'm not one to walk out of movie, but I truly had to put in so much effort to sit through this cringe-worthy movie. I have no clue why this is getting good ratings, and read through a lot of other peoples' comments to try and find out why, and actually came across one person who said practically word-for-word what my boyfriend and I had discussed directly after our viewing.This review points out EXACTLY what was wrong with this terrible film: --------------------------------- Boring and Cliché, 15 April 2009Author: B_D from USAI'm not the type of person to walk out of a movie - in fact, I've never done it - but Adventureland made it a challenge to stay in the theater in a way that few films do.Let me preface this by saying that I hadn't seen any previews or heard much about Adventureland, so I wasn't expecting a Superbad-esquire romp like many other reviewers apparently did. I didn't know whether I was going for a comedy, a drama, a coming-of-age flick, or what. I had an open mind, willing to accept whatever I saw, and yet I was incredibly disappointed and confused by the end of it.Adventureland suffers from having an incredibly cliché plot, the standard awkward boy meets troubled girl fare that we've all seen hundreds of times before. From early on in the movie, I was able to figure out exactly where it was going, and at no point was I thrown for a loop. Everything proceeds according to genre conventions. There is nothing new or unexpected here. Additionally, there is a strange fatalistic tone that pervades the movie that manages to be overly serious and depressing without being at all deep.None of the main characters are in any way likable or believable. A large portion of the plot revolves around the difficulty that Jesse Eisenberg's character (James) has expressing his affection for Kristen Stewart's character (Em) and attempting to make the relationship work. I guess this was supposed to be a meaningful story about two misunderstood college kids trying to reach out to each other and looking for love in all the wrong place, blah blah blah. Instead, James comes off as a boring, awkward guy who becomes infatuated with the first girl who gives him any attention; Em never rises above our first impression of her as a cookie-cutter troubled teen who keeps James around for his good weed connection. Because of this, I couldn't bring myself to care about what happened to either of them.Too much of this movie seems to be an attempt by the forty-something director Greg Mottola to prove that he can still seem cool to today's youth. The characters are constantly smoking weed (okay, we get it, they're cool, introspective kids!) and dropping stereotypical lines to bring attention to it: ""This is some GREAT WEED James"" or ""Man I am SO HIGH."" For some reason this is set in the 1980s, I guess for some sort of faux-cool retro feeling, or maybe just so people can namedrop Lou Reed every ten seconds. Unfortunately, the setting was terribly executed: half of the characters are wearing trendy American Apparel fashion, and Yo La Tengo's recognizably modern score is jarring when juxtaposed with famous 80's tunes.Overall, Adventureland fails on almost every level. The comedy? Terrible. The drama? Played out. The characters? Boring. The acting? Meh. The setting? Poorly executed. Avoid this movie, I don't know how it is getting such good reviews.",Adventureland
224,CodyGriffis,Superbad's Daddy,8,26 January 2009,"I saw this movie at The Sundance Film Festival in Salt Lake City and I've been wanting to see it for months but I have a habit of anticipating movies and building them up, then once I see them I am disappointed. This was not the case. It is a lot like Superbad set in the 80's and minus the drawings. The quirky, awkward humor is there, the teen party humor is there, the love humor is there. One thing this movie has that Superbad didn't though, is a truly heart felt and believable love story that gives Adventureland a bit of a more serious tone. While it is hilarious it also has you really pulling for the young lovers and gets you involved in their affairs. With out giving too much away, all I can say is 'Go see this movie. If you liked Superbad, you'll like Adventureland, if you hated Superbad, you'll like Adventureland. It's a win-win situation.'",Adventureland
225,Loo_C,Absolutely brilliant....,8,24 September 2009,"I'll start by saying, I loved this film. Really loved it.Having read through some of the negative reviews, the problem most people seem to have with the film is that it wasn't what they were expecting. I can't really comment on the marketing as I wanted to see this film long before I saw much of it. People who didn't like it seemingly went into the cinema or put on the DVD expecting another 'Superbad' and I can say, this film is nothing like 'Superbad' and I don't think it's trying to be. It should be judged completely separate from that film, because it is. And it's all the better for it. I think perhaps the people who were expecting something else should watch again with an open-mind, because judging this film just against another and not on it's own quality and merits, is a shame. This film isn't an obvious comedy, it's a realistic and thoughtful film that manages to avoid being sappy but remains heart-warming.A lot of people are saying this isn't funny and I disagree. I laughed a lot whilst watching. It's certainly not 'smack-you-in-the-face' humour, but I definitely think there's humour there. I found there to be a lot of laughable moments.I think all of the actors/actresses are superb. There isn't one performance I was unsure about whilst watching. Every part was played fantastically. I really, really enjoyed Kristen Stewart's performance as Em, a character who could come across as unlikeable but who she makes lovable and relatable. Her facial expressions are amazing. Anyone who says she can't act is, I believe, firmly proved wrong by this film. Her deliverance is fantastic, especially during the scenes with Connall leading up to, and when she tells him she wants to end their affair, and the scene afterwards with James on the street after he figured out where she was. I also enjoyed Martin Starr playing Joel, who was great when it came to letting his vulnerability show. All of the performances are very subtle; there's no in-your-face, over the top acting, which really fits with the tone of the film.The atmosphere, soundtrack and costumes are fabulous too.There is probably a lot more I could say about this gem, and I may write another review with more thoughts. I think this is a wonderful film, I enjoyed it very much and I highly recommend it. As long as you're not expecting another 'Superbad'!",Adventureland
226,BatemanMinusE,You get exactly what you expect. Hows that for a clever summary,7,24 March 2009,"I just saw a preview screening of this, and it met my expectations.As far as the Judd Apatow inspired comedies go, this one's a little darker than usual, but still falls in the middle ground. It delivers some good repeat gags, and some snappy one liners. Many of the situations were easily predicted, but they still ended up being pretty entertaining. There were some very good sequences, particularly one involving weed cookies, and Bill Hader, who is by far the funniest part of the movie.It's set in the mid eighties, but apart from a few shots of Madonna'd out girls, some 80's punk rockers and the song Amadeus over and over, you would hardly tell. Mega props to using so much Lou Reed though.It was fun to watch, but I don't think I would pay to see it in theaters, luckily my screening was free. I'm sure it'll be playing during Comedy Central's daytime programming, and it'll be fun to watch then too.",Adventureland
227,staccone-shane,Unsatisfying Movie,1,5 April 2009,"First, let me just say that Kristen Stewart isn't a very exciting actress. There isn't much versatility with her from what I've seen thus far. Hopefully, that new Twilight movie has more to offer for fans, but that's another review and time. Overall, Adventureland was a bit confusing. From what we seen in the trailer, it was a comedy, similar to the likes of Superbad, Knocked Up, etc. After viewing the movie, it clearly is not a comedy. Which is fine, except for the fact that it didn't really make a good romance movie either. It wanted to be a teenage, romantic comedy but it just came out lazy. The ending was boring and to put it simply, it just left me feeling unsatisfied; especially after having sat thru an hour and forty-five minutes of it. Although, considering that pretty much for the whole movie, you're left going nowhere; I guess it didn't really call for any kind of closure....and in that case, I understand the ending completely. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",Adventureland
228,MoveTwice,A bit overrated,6,5 April 2009,"If your expecting the laughs of Superbad in another movie, don't expect it in this one! The movie has several chuckle points, and even more if you can identify some your real life friends with the characters. But their weren't any incredibly memorable great laughs or moments from the movie like their was in Superbad. The movie was more of a Chickflicky-esquire Comedy than it was a Comedy, it had more kissing than I have seen in just about any movie lately.The main characters Jesse and Ema filled their roles well, but in many points their roles appeared overly awkward, which ruined some moments. The transformation the characters take is quite cool, but the air of lame awkwardness lingers a bit too long.If your expecting another Superbad don't bother seeing this in theaters and just grab it on DVD, it wasn't anything impressive, and right now with a 8 on IMDb is largely overrated. This movie deserves a 6 or D in my book because it just barely passes as a mediocre movie. On the positive I stayed through the whole movie even at the loss of some of my Friday night. Oh and by the way I got in free cause my friend is an employee and I still feel a bit jipped, the movie just had a large hole of emptiness.I actually created an IMDb account just to help give this movie a more accurate depiction so I hope this helps!",Adventureland

The main plot was not interesting and really dragged the movie down. The characters were dull and lacked energy. The humor lacked any effort and substance. Seems like a mixture of other movie ideas thrown into this one. Throughout the movie, I kept hoping for something memorable, but sadly, I could not find anything original. The casting just didn't work out for this movie. The acting seemed very labored and nothing inspiring or creative. What I found really annoying are the emotional scenes that were too melodramatic for a comedy, which reminded me of some cheap daytime soap. I really did not get any good vibes or feelings from this movie. I was left thinking, I could have thought up more interesting twists and plots.

So when I saw it in a Netfilx envelope sur la kitchen table, courtesy of my roommate, I was eager to give it a viewing; however, gazing upon the oven clock which snarled, ""2:38(am),"" I decided to give it only a partial viewing. I expected an Andy Sandberg style comedy that would make me chuckle at first and eventually wear me to sleep. But what I witnessed was so intriguing and out of focus from my highest expectations that I soon gave this original, savvy comedy my full attention. Most surprising was the fact that the lead in this movie wasn't Andy Sandberg at all, but a young and talented Andy-Sandberg-look-alike named Jesse Eisenberg. Eisenberg's portrayal of the nerve-prone turned confident, ""James"" was so real that you can't help but fall in love with his character. Also surprising was the serious role handed to Ryan Reynolds. And again, although his character was a bit of a jerk, you can't help but fall in love with him. The cast dances perfectly on the screen, interpreting the lightly touched subject of young adulthood post college. And the 80's setting is cooked up just right with Lou Reed references not seen in such devotion since Trainspotting. What I expected was a slap-stick movie I could fall asleep to, what I got was a thoughtful movie centered around a common enemy, a summer job. Give it a view!",Adventureland

I'll definitely keep an eye on these two actors in the future and also this director who was new to me. The theme was well captured for the time era although not over the top.

They play heavily on the fact that it is from the same creators of Superbad, but the movie is in no way a comedy. I failed to find any part of the movie a comedy, in fact I had to turn it off about 30 minutes in, because I felt it painful to go any further with no comedy aspect to it. Perhaps this movie could be considered a satire of sorts. But, if you are looking for a standard, funny, comedy look elsewhere.

234,thomas-gahr,Don't overlook this movie!,10,1 October 2009,"As several comments have noted, the marketing for this movie is way off the mark. This is not a teen focused, crotch joke kind of movie. This is a wonderfully balanced, wistful look back at a time and a period that is often painted in cartoonish colors. I admit to having a soft spot in my heart for this movie, having spent the summer of 1987 (the time frame for Adventureland) working in the games booths at a Western New York amusement park. So the very setting of the story brings back a flood of memories. Seriously, if you are in your 40's you need to see this movie, you will love it as a period piece alone.This is also not a teenage ""coming of age"" movie, even though it hits on some of the same themes. The lead character's virginity is not made a focus of mockery, but is treated with respect and actually as something that is to be admired, if you can imagine that. This is movie that focuses on that transition from small town, working class, kid to adulthood. For anyone that grew up in the rust belt in the 80's, you remember what it was like to stand with one foot in the past, and one foot in the ""real world"", hesitating for a moment between your working class roots, and the college-degree-ticket out of town. This movie focuses on that summer in the life of one kid.I am saddened to see how the studio dropped the ball with this one.

235,cinemainreview,Nobody Wins A Giant A** Panda,7,18 October 2009,"""Adventureland"" is the semiautobiographical coming-of-age drama by Greg Mottola that effortlessly transcends the trappings of its genre. Set in 1987, the film follows James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg), a recent college graduate who unexpectedly finds himself working at the Adventureland amusement park for the summer. The park is one of those charming places where you can get a giant stuffed panda bear, a spoiled corndog, and probably tetanus for about ten dollars in ride tickets. But, for James, it is the place where he will learn his most valuable life lessons and perhaps even find love with the beautiful Em (Kristen Stewart), a young woman who has been reluctantly having an affair with the married maintenance man, Connell (Ryan Reynolds).

236,gvhockey25,"Adventureland - Goofy, simple, moronic, and fun",6,31 July 2015,"Adventureland represents everything I pray my first months as a college graduate do not included. Although worse things than bro- ing out with Ryan Reynolds and having Kristen Stewart fall madly in love me could without-a-doubt go down. Jesse Eisenberg, the un-expected hero of Adventureland (expected hero, really) portrays a less asshole-ish version of his Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network, pulling out all the nerdy stops, including but not limited to: an immensely awkward and unfailing stammer when speaking to any remotely attractive woman, a less-than- flattering Jew-fro, and a borderline translucent complexion (admittedly much like my own). Kristen Stewart is well, Kristen Stewart, bringing the exact same mannerisms and monotone speech that she brings to every other film she's been in. Last but not least, Ryan Reynolds plays the classic douche. Did I mention that Adventureland takes place in the 80's? I shouldn't be too harsh, though, considering that I actually enjoyed the film and the acting wasn't all that bad. Do not be mistaken, Adventureland is for the youthful, it is for those looking for a light-hearted comedy, it might even be for the unintelligent (not exclusively but mainly, so I surmise), but all this does not mean that it is a bad movie. Adventureland is a small, probably a bit underrated for what it is, romantic-comedy, whose scale tips more in favor of comedy. This, I believe, is for the best. I am not sure this trio of actors, all with their total of one solid performance between them (see paragraph above), are ready to form a Scarlet Letter-esque love triangle in a dramatic romance film akin to that of Blue Valentine or Her or even something similar to the more humorous but still-siding-with-romance-over-comedy, (500) Days of Summer (though Reynolds has certainly tried). Adventureland is funny, and I wouldn't think anyone who has seen it would fight with me on this. Bill Hader, as Bobby, steals the show with his sheer absurdity. One scene in particular is especially hilarious. It comes after James (Eisenberg) stands up for Em (Stewart) by jabbing a slightly over-weight and probably drunk more- or-less hillbilly in the abdomen, which causes the hillbilly's equally likely-to-wear-a-trucker-hat friend to angrily chase James around Adventureland, the carnival where he and Em have summer jobs. James races into the main office and breathes out the words, ""Someone is trying to kill me."" Hader responds, he grabs his women's softball bat and exits the office screaming profanities and essential death threats at the attacker, who, believing Hader to be a full- blown psychopath, runs off. Along with attacking a patron of Adventureland who refuses to properly dispose of his empty soda and insanely commentating for a predetermined race of plastic horse cut-outs, Hader dominates the movie, keeping it fresh and making it easy to watch the film in its entirety. While, I refuse to say there was anything redeeming about Reynolds in Adventureland, himself and his character included, there were moments that I was pleasantly surprised by the Eisenberg and Stewart's acting efforts. Specifically was James' confrontation of Em after discovering that she has been sleeping with Connell in secret, which has been the cause of Em's self-loathing and inability to commit to James (Reynolds really does his darndest to f@#k everything up in this one). Stewart's incredible stress and confusion are remarkably apparent on her crying face as she watches her love life go to complete and total sh%t all in about five minutes. Then, she returns home, where her rapidly balding step- mother calls her an ""ungrateful bitch."" Rough. Maybe the acting is tad bit underwhelming, maybe the arch of the film's plot is disappointingly predictable, maybe I wanted to strangle Ryan Reynolds for the entire runtime of the film, but, in the end, I still like this movie. Like many movies about young people, Adventureland connects with well, young people. It's definitely no Ferris Bueller's Day Off or Breakfast Club (I didn't exactly want to crash a massive parade in the heart of downtown Chicago or befriend a low-life named John Bender after seeing this film), but I did connect with the notion of longing for love and excitement. James has a grand vision of what he hopes his life will be like, a vision that contrasts hideously with how his life is now, and he ultimately finds this to be deeply upsetting. These feelings are probably felt by a multitude of young men and women, and I pride Adventureland for being aware of that. However, much like the arch of the plot, this trope has been played upon time and time again. I like Adventureland for the simple reason that it is funny and light-hearted, I connect with it on some level, and it is by no means an investment watching it (it's not a ""thinker,"" so to speak). I would recommend it for date night; that's probably the best way that I can describe Adventureland.",Adventureland
237,masshakar,boring,1,19 March 2012,"Really this sh*t was a comedy? It doesn't deserve to be in any kind of genre. It is literally one of the most boring movies I've ever laid eyes upon. It's just about some nerds (not the funny, really awkward kind) getting laid. That's all it is. The complete lack of plot and emotion, the length of the movie, how uninteresting the characters were, are just a few things that define it's lack of appeal.Why does this have a 7.0? Some of the better reviews are nostalgic of the 80's. This movie is a complete failure. The people who like this are probably the same people who like other stupid movies with Kristen Stewart.",Adventureland
238,akeiser88,Stupid and pointless,3,27 August 2013,"This movie was really a waste of time. I feel like nothing happened in the entire movie. I have no idea what the purpose of the movie is, and the scenes just drag on and on with stupid conversation.Every conversation was beyond awkward and nobody really says anything to each other. During the fight scenes between Kristin Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg you are just yelling at the screen for them to talk. Instead they make dopey faces at each other and stalk off. Kristin Stewart has to be one of the worst actresses in Hollywood. She literally has the same exact expression for every emotion. She would have the same face if she was trying to force out diarrhea as she would if she was petting a puppy. I think a brick could have acted better than her in this movie.Also, why the hell is Ryan Reynolds in this movie? There was absolutely no reason for him to be in the movie other than his name. Anyone could have played his boring one-dimensional role. Same with Bill Hader and Kristin Wigg, what a waste of talent here; seriously I think I got one chuckle out of those two the entire movie.Don't waste your time with this movie, not even on Netflix.",Adventureland
239,sideburn-2,Bitter Sweet call back to John Hugues Craft,8,28 September 2010,"I just saw the movie last night and fell in love. The director/writer Greg Motolla once again creates a great small movie. Mottola extracts good performances from Jesse Einsenberg, Kristen Stewart, Ryan Reynolds and Martin Starr ( perfect in his awkwardness). Adventureland produces a real nostalgic taste and even if you weren't born a that time the movie resonates honest emotions and the bittersweetness of the Hughes classics'Party of Five and Pretty in Pink, where the characters feel real and complex. The great soundtrack, filled with Velvet Underground, The Cure and even guilty pleasures as Falco, reproduces the mood of the eighties. After the movie was impossible to stay at home, then i grab my mp3 player and went driving my bike around town enjoying that feeling under a cold night.",Adventureland
240,einarleif,Can't say this is a bad film just boring,4,3 June 2009,"I went to the cinema tonight expecting a good comedy and instead got a romantic comedy that wasn't very funny. It had it's chuckle moments but no laugh out loud funny. Well here in Iceland we have intermission so me and my friend walked out, therefore I missed the second half. This is by no means a bad movie. It has a solid soundtrack, OK acting and the direction seemed fine. But I just thought it was boring, just not for me. maybe it was because I was expecting a different kind of movie who knows.If your in the mood for a good romance movie I'd say sure give it a go, but it is not a great comedy like Superbad.",Adventureland
241,poswm,A very very average average average movie,5,30 July 2009,"The formula for ""romantic comedies"" is thus: Guy and girl get together. Guy and girl break up. Guy and girl get back together. Movie IMMEDIATELY ends at this point.If the movie kept going for another month or two you would see that they break up again or one of them dies, etc. This is always verified by sequels to romantic comedies.Adventureland is not a comedy as the marketing department would have us believe. Instead it is a movie that very strictly follows the ""romantic comedy"" formula. Two of the biggest flaws with this film: 1.) Why did they put Ryan Renyolds in the film if they didn't afford him any comedic lines? 2.) Just because the James Brennan character has the pick of two women does not mean he has to pick one. One is promiscuous and the other is mentally unstable. Neither actually cares about him. Sometimes staying single is the best option.",Adventureland
242,pitate,Waist of time,1,9 August 2009,"I don't know how is thinking the creator of this movie.May be, he lost a great love when try to study at university, but, I see the movie last night, waiting for a good change, something interesting with characters, with story, but, is a shame, end with lot of dramas... Rest in peace but, 7.6 at this time, is too much for the movie.First, when he is kick from girlfriend, is a shame, but, do not give more intensity in the interpretation... Second, job recruitment at this location, too easy... Third, awful actuation from the people who ""won"" big panda and the problems of this prize...Waist of time, only I see again when show on national TV with others dumb movies at same time and nothing to read at reach of my hand.",Adventureland
