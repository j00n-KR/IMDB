0,SnoopyStyle,interesting potential but no laughs,5,30 November 2018,"Puppets are sentient but they are strictly second class citizens. Phil Phillips is a puppet private investigator in L.A. Once upon a time, he was the first and still only police detective in the LAPD. He gets hired to investigate a blackmail threat. He happens upon a puppet massacre which reunites him with his former partner Detective Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy). They both hate each other. Next, Phil's brother is killed. The victims seem to be connected as former castmates on the legendary puppet-human show, ""The Happytime Gang"". As more castmates are killed, Phil is forced to join Connie in the investigation.I really like the premise and there is some interesting ideas early on. As the movie continues, it's obvious that the laughs aren't hitting. The writing is bad and the comedy is straining to be funny. It's a failure. It needs more imagination than an elevator pitch. I wish Phil Phillips is voiced by someone recognizable. I understand Connie's position but it could be better if she's more respectful. It's all in the subpar writing which dooms the movie's initial potential.",The Happytime Murders
1,Prismark10,Puppet world,6,24 November 2018,Well it is not Sesame Street or The Muppets.The Happytime Murders was directed by Brian Oz and it is set in a world where puppets and humans co-exist. The puppets are clearly the underclass.Phil Phillips was the first puppet to join the police where he partnered Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy.)After an incident where a shooting went wrong. Phil lost his badge and is now washed up private detective.However a puppet walks into his office and tells Phil she is being blackmailed. Phil accepts the case and while making an enquiry a shooting takes place. One of the victim's was a cast member of The Happytime Family show from the 1990s. Later Phil's own brother who was also a member of the cast is ripped apart by some dogs.Phil and Connie reluctantly team up to investigate the murders as Phil comes under suspicion.The story and the mystery is rather weak. The humour is juvenile and crude. In a weird way the film works. It certainly is not high brow but it was fun.,The Happytime Murders
2,nogodnomasters,The drapes don't match the carpet.,4,9 September 2018,"Melissa McCarthy revives her role as a foul-mouthed cop. She teams up with puppet Phil Philips in an attempt to solve a serial killing of the former cast of a puppet show. The film had its moments but reminded me of ""Fritz the Cat."" It seemed it needed to be vulgar for the sake of being vulgar because it was using a medium that was strictly for kids. At no time did they use the word ""Muppet"" or any of the standard characters we have come to know. There were some societal statements made about discrimination and how the lower class attempts to look like the ruling class. I liked that aspect, but it appears they didn't want to overshadow the ""vulgar muppets"" theme but attempting a social statement. Guide: F-word. Muppet sex. No nudity. muppet gore",The Happytime Murders
3,kosmasp,"Rude, crude and full of ...",8,3 May 2019,"Well not full of, but there is nudity - puppet nudity! And yes, if that is offensive to you, than this movie is not something you should watch. Not to mention the language, the ""violence"" and also Puppets getting it on. Now it is uneven at times and you don't really have a story that is going to challenge you much, so the story does rely on shocking.I think it achieved that. That doesn't mean you will like it and I know that my rating seems high to some, but if you consider what hurdles they have to undertake to make a movie that is adult (or juvenille), than that is an achievement in itself. Check your morals at the door or don't even bother entering. It's your time to waste or enjoy",The Happytime Murders
4,Sleepin_Dragon,"Terrible, but funny.",6,5 September 2018,"It would be the easiest thing in the world to alate this film and brand it terrible, but I'm going to focus on the positives, the media hate seems this the worst film of the year, and true it's not good. However is very different, it's very original, and at times it had myself and the whole cinema laughing loudly. They took a risk, and I'm unsure it will have paid off, they went for a safe pair of comedy hands with Melissa McCarthy, and personally I found her really funny. Obviously the film has limitations with what it can do, and where it can go, but it's not so bad as it's being made out to be. The Sharon Stone scene is absolutely hilarious.It's not a wow, but at least it's different, that deserves some credit in this day and age, right? 6/10",The Happytime Murders
5,jboothmillard,The Happytime Murders,6,6 September 2018,"When I saw the trailer, I was instantly reminded of other adult puppet movies, like Peter Jackson's Meet the Feebles and Team America: World Police, but this one came from The Jim Henson Company, the most celebrated puppet studio of all, I was really looking forward to it, directed by Brian Henson (The Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Treasure Island). Basically in a world where puppets coexist with humans, Phil Phillips (Bill Barretta, best known as the Pepe the Prawn) is a puppet who lives in Los Angeles. He was the first puppet cop in the LAPD before being fired, he now works as a private detective with his human secretary Bubbles (Bridesmaids' Maya Rudolph). Phil is approached by puppet client Sandra (Dorien Davies), he is hired to find out who has been blackmailing her. He follows a lead to a puppet-owned porn shop, Phil goes into the backroom to check the records, while he is gone, an unknown attacker comes in and kills everyone present. It is revealed one of the customers, Bumblypants (Kevin Clash, best known as Elmo), is a cast member from popular 90s puppet sitcom ""The Happytime Gang"". The LAPD arrive at the crime scene, Phillips is reunited with his former partner, Detective Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy), they had a falling out. Twelve years ago, Edwards was being held at gunpoint by a puppet criminal, and Phil tried to shoot him, but he missed and hit an innocent puppet, killing him in front of his young daughter. The thug shot Edwards, but she killed him before he got away, the gunshot was nearly fatal Edwards, and she was given a puppet liver after being taken to a puppet clinic, the closest available medical treatment facility at the time. Edwards was left with an addiction to sugar, which is essentially like heroin to puppets; Edwards later testified against Phil, he was taken off the force, and a law was put in place to prevent puppets from becoming cops. Edwards believes the porn shop killings was a robbery gone wrong, but Phil notes that the assailant didn't take anything, it is now a murder investigation. That night, former Happytime cast member Larry Shenanigans (Victor Yerrid), also Bill's brother, is torn apart by a group of dogs let into the house by someone, Phil is enraged, at the request of Lieutenant Banning (Leslie David Baker) he reluctantly agrees to work with Edwards to find the killer. They believe the killers may be targeting members of The Happytime Gang, they also discover the show contract promises the large amount of royalty money to surviving members, they suspect someone may want to kill them off to get the money to themselves. Phil and Edwards track down former cast member Lyle (also Clash), who is now a drug lord dealing sugar, only for him to be killed in a drive-by shooting in front of Philips. The next day, Phil goes to see Jenny Peterson (Elizabeth Banks), the only human Happytime cast member, and his former girlfriend, she now works at a puppet strip club. Following their conversation, she gets into her car, she is seemingly killed when it explodes, the police arrive and see Phil leaving the scene, they now believe he is responsible for the murders. Phil hides out at Edwards' apartment, they discover that another Happytime cast member, now homeless sugar addict Goofer (Drew Massey), has been found dead, apparently overdosing and falling into the ocean. Phil and Edwards head out of town to find the two remaining Happytime Gang members, Ezra (Ted Michaels) and Cara (Colleen Smith), but when they arrive at their house, they find their bodies mangled inside. The killer escapes the crime scene, and the FBI shows up with other agents to arrest Phil and Edwards. Sandra is brought in for interrogation, she lies that Phil killed Jenny and the others, she claims he was trying to keep her to himself, and she reveals she was Jenny's wife. The FBI detains Philips, and after arguing with FBI Special Agent Campbell (Joel McHale), Edwards is suspended from duty. Bubbles finds Edwards in her apartment and asks for her help in proving Phil's innocence, Bubbles has Sandra's home address, they break into her place to find any information they can. They come across a hidden room with pictures and notes planning the deaths of the Happytime Gang, as well as a whole conspiracy against Phil. Edwards then notices a picture of Jasper Jakoby, the puppet man who Phil accidentally shot years ago, Edwards realises Sandra is Jasper's daughter, and she has been planning revenge against Phil for her father's death. Bubbles sees a tape recorder saying ""Play Me"", she presses the play button, which ignites a fire, destroying all the evidence against Sandra. Edwards goes to tell Phil what she's learned, and she breaks Phil out of jail to stop Sandra. Phil and Edwards make it to the airport, where Sandra is planning to depart with all the royalty money, as Jenny's spouse she is the sole surviving heir to the money. Phil tries to apologise for killing her father, saying it has haunted him all those years, but he asks why the Happytime Gang had to die because of it. Then it turns out that Jenny is still alive, having faked her death, and is in cahoots with Sandra, but Sandra instead knocks Jenny out to take the money for herself and get away. Edwards runs after Sandra before she gets on a private plane, but Sandra gets the drop on her first and holds her at gunpoint, putting Phil in the same position as twelve years ago, Phil takes his shot, but doesn't miss, hitting Sandra in the head and killing her. Banning arrives to congratulate Phil and Edwards on cracking the case, Edwards can return to active duty and the mayor will revoke the law against puppets being cops, Phil is welcome back on the force, Phil also asks Bubbles out to dinner, and she accepts. Also starring Michael McDonald as Ronovan Scargle, Jimmy O. Yang as Officer Delancey, Ryan Gaul as Officer Milligan and Brian Henson as Crab. McCarthy is a good choice as the sugar-addicted human detective, partnered with a great blue no-nonsense potty-mouthed fuzzball private investigator, performed perfectly by Barretta, and Rudolph is great as the puppet's optimistic, upbeat secretary. This film spoofs many conventions we have seen in family-friendly puppet movies, it works well as a crime-solving story, and there are plenty of naughty laughs along the way, with plenty of swearing, comic violence, and even sex and drugs, the highlight is the aggressive sex in the office scene, with spray cream going all over the walls, if you are looking for the alternative adult Muppet movie, this is it, a really funny and enjoyable black comedy. Good!",The Happytime Murders
6,BA_Harrison,A feeble effort.,2,23 June 2019,"I liked this film much better when it was called Meet The Feebles, when badly-behaving puppets with potty mouths were an original idea and a whole lot funnier. Besmirching his father's legacy, director Brian Henson gives us a laugh-free exercise in bad taste that once again proves that Melissa McCarthy is a dreadful comedic actress. When you're outclassed by a bunch of felt creations, perhaps it's time to call it a day.McCarthy plays police detective Connie Edwards, whose latest case, a spate of puppet murders, is also being investigated by ex-cop-turned-private-eye puppet Phil Philips (voiced by Bill Barretta). Eventually, Connie and Phil team up to track down the killer. Crude, not-in-the-least-bit-funny scenes include puppet sex (Phil ejaculating silly string), McCarthy snorting lines of purple sparkly sugar (the puppets' drug of choice), and a puppet recreation of the leg-crossing scene from Basic Instinct (puppet vagina with purple puppet muff).I've no objection to movies that are in questionable taste, only when they're as poorly acted and totally devoid of laughs as this one.",The Happytime Murders
7,zardoz-13,The Crappy Time Murders!!!,1,15 September 2018,"The fiftysomething son of Muppets creator Jim Henson, Brian Henson may have thought everybody would laugh hysterically at the sight of his father's ""Sesame Street"" Muppets wallowing in puppet sex, killing other puppets, and spewing R-rated ""Scarface"" obscenities. Indeed, the production company behind ""Sesame Street"" sued STX Films for an early poster displaying the tagline: ""No Sesame, All Street."" Mind you, none of the actual ""Sesame Street"" Muppet characters are ridiculed in Henson's farce. Nevertheless, The Sesame Workshop argued such advertising ""deliberately confuses consumers into mistakenly believing that Sesame is associated with, has allowed, or has even endorsed or produced the movie and tarnishes Sesame's brand."" Judge Vernon Broderick threw the case out. Although they lost the lawsuit, The Sesame Workshop must be elated that Henson' abominable police procedural comedy ""The Happytime Murders"" bombed during its first week in release. Forging a make-believe world where ""meat sacks"" and ""felties"" bump into each other, this lame laffer earned only a quarter of its $40-million budget. Puppets refer to humans as ""meat sacks,"" while humans call puppets ""felties."" Comparisons between ""The Happytime Murders"" and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988), where cartoon characters co-existed with humans are inevitable. Despite its top-notch CGI of Muppets 'behaving badly' and its celebrity cast, featuring Melissa McCarthy, Maya Rudolph, and Elizabeth Banks, this predictable, half-baked hokum should have been called ""The Crappytime Murders."" Basically, neither Henson nor scenarists Todd Berger and Dee Austin Robertson have conjured up enough sidesplitting jokes to weather its lowest-common-denominator 91 minutes. Moreover, the jokes are neither shamelessly nor hilariously memorable. If you've seen the trailer where puppets perform ""Basic Instinct"" sex and the guy squirts 'silly-string' semen, you've seen the most provocative scene. Another scene with a Dominatrix Dalmatian whipping a semi-nude, tied-down fireman while yelping, ""I'm gonna piss on you like a fire hydrant"" is more idiotic than erotic. This whodunit takes place in the seedy underbelly of contemporary Los Angeles. Mankind has marginalized puppets as second-class citizens, and the filmmakers cannot resist exposing the racism with which humans belittle puppets. The action concerns the puppets who starred in ""The Happytime Gang,"" a popular 1990's kiddie show. Humans embraced this groundbreaking sit-com about puppets, and puppets attracted greater sympathy from humans. Decades afterward, the lucrative syndication rights for the show are up for grabs. Now, a serial slayer is stalking and knocking-off the seven puppet cast members one-by-one. Lieutenant Banning of the LAPD (Leslie David Baker of ""Elizabethtown"") assigns former police detective Phil Phillips (long-time Muppeteer vet Bill Barretta) to serve as a consultant for his former partner, Detective Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy of ""Identity Thief""), to solve these homicides. Traces of bad blood linger between Phil and Connie. For the record, Phil is a sky-blue Muppet with black hair who resembles former ""Late Late Show"" talk host Tom Synder, and he doesn't mind kicking the crap out of anybody. Phil was a rising star in the LAPD, until a pistol-packing puppet took Connie hostage in a stand-off. Phil fired at the perpetrator, but his bullet ricocheted and killed an innocent bystander. Connie caught a slug in the liver when she disarmed her truculent captor. Desperately, Phil rushed her to the nearest medical facility, and it turned out to be a puppet hospital. Although the puppet doctor refused to operate on a human, Phil waved the muzzle of his service revolver under his nose. Since acquiring a felt liver, Connie contends with many of the afflictions puppets suffer on a daily basis. Puppets crave sugar as if it were cocaine, and Connie has dozens of Maple Syrup bottles chilling in her fridge. Now, Phil ekes out a living as a private investigator. One day, switch-hitting, nympho puppet Sandra White (Dorien Davies) slinks into his office. She hires Phil to thwart blackmailers demanding $350-thousand from her. The first place Phil heads is a smut shop. He is trying to trace the cut-out letters in the blackmail note to a porno magazine. Meantime, a masked gunman enters the store, kills the owner and his two employees, who were staging a porno about an octopus milking a slutty dairy cow with his tentacles. The gunman blows their felt heads off with a shotgun. BLAM! BLAM! During this blazing mayhem, Phil occupied himself in the smut owner's office, scrutinizing a list of suspects who might have clipped letters from the porno magazine for Sandra's blackmail message. Nevertheless, the LAPD treat Phil as 'a person of interest' despite his story that he heard nothing in the owner's office. Now, Phil is on the lam, and Connie is struggling to protect him, while they ferret out clues to the identities of the killers.Comparably, ""The Happytime Murders"" isn't nearly as rude, crude, and offensive as Peter Jackson's ""Meet the Feebles"" (1989), Trey Parker's ""Team America: World Police"" (2004), and Seth MacFarlane's two ""Ted"" comedies with Mark Walhberg. Mind you, the prospect of a ""Happytime Murders"" sequel is probably as infinitesimal as ""Ted 3."" Sadly, Henson and his writers provide a far from adequate history about the origins of this strange new world where puppets talk. Principally, when did the Muppets become sentient? Sure, these questions may not bother you, but some explanation should have been offered. We watch puppets play cards, orchestrate drive-by shootings, and generally act like criminals. Puppet die violently in this murder-riddled melodrama. Bullets blow the stuffing out of these puppets when dogs aren't mistaking them for chew toys. The puppet work is probably some of the best. Publicity material for ""The Happytime Murders"" reveals that Henson and company fashioned about 125 Muppet-like puppets for it. Indeed, the interaction between the actors and the puppets looks appropriately goofy. While she is cast as the top-billed detective, Melissa McCarthy plays second banana to Phil. Maya Rudolph steals every scene as Phil's radiant secretary 'Bubbles' who can pick locks. Neither trailblazing nor sharp-edged enough as a satire, ""The Happytime Murders"" scrapes the bottom of the barrel with little to show for it.",The Happytime Murders
8,Wizard-8,Lame comedy,2,15 April 2019,"Some people have branded this movie to be a kind of rip-off of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", though in actual fact combining a human world with a puppet world was done long before that other movie, such as with ""Sesame Street"". Taking this idea and making it for an adults-only audience was promising, but the end results are very disappointing. The main problem with the movie is that it's executed in a very low energy style. Sure, there's plenty of ""R""-rated material, but the way it's set up and executed has absolutely no bite or even shock value. While there are a few (mild) chuckles, the tame and unimaginative direction makes most of the gags obvious and not the least bit funny. It doesn't help that despite a considerable budget, the whole enterprise has the look and feel of a prime time television drama rather than a theatrical movie. If you want to see an adults-only movie concerning puppets, hunt down a copy of the funny Peter Jackson movie ""Meet the Feebles"" instead. Heck, you'd even be better off hunting down a copy of the rare 1976 XXX puppet porno ""Let My Puppets Come""!",The Happytime Murders

11,Hellmant,Only hit-and-miss funny.,6,31 August 2018,"'HAPPYTIME MURDERS': Three Stars (Out of Five)A dark raunchy comedy set in a world where puppets and humans co-exist, a former LAPD puppet, turned private investigator, must team with his former human partner in order to solve a spree of recent puppet murders (the former cast of a popular 80's kids TV show). It was directed by Brian Henson, the son of Jim Henson (and the director of 1992's 'THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL' and 1996's 'MUPPET TREASURE ISLAND'), and it was written by Todd Berger and Dee Austin Robertson. The film stars Melissa McCarthy, Bill Barretta, Maya Rudolph, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie David Baker and Joel McHale. It's gotten mostly negative reviews from critics, and mediocre reviews from fans, but it is a modest hit at the Box Office though. I loved the movie's originality, and it's courage to be a really dark and raunchy puppet movie. I also think the cast is all brilliant in it, and Brian Henson is a very talented and inspirational filmmaker (just like his father). Still the movie is only hit-and-miss funny, and some of it is just a little too strange, disgustingly crude and 'not funny'. I give it a lot of points for effort though, even though it fails as much as it succeeds.",The Happytime Murders

13,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Good concept, but fails to really materialise into what it could have been",4,16 April 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn a mysterious, parrelell world in which humans and puppets co-exist, Phil Phillips, a puppet detective, must reunite with his disliked human former partner Detective Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy), with whom he shares a troubled history, when several of his former co-stars on an 80s TV show are murdered in a porn store. Yet, their bumpy past could hold the key to their current predicament.In recent years (certainly throughout the 2010s) big, mainstream comedy has started to revolve highly around these big, outlandish ideas, involving adult interpretations of set ups traditionally held by more family oriented films, such as the Ted films, and the more recent Sausage Party, where Pixar style animation was used to tell a story revolving around smutty jokes and crude language. And so, into this frame comes The Happytime Murders, director Brian Henson's first project at the helm in over twenty five years since The Muppet Christmas Carol in 1992, where the Muppet style puppets that made the Henson family famous are brought in for the adult treatment.In an early scene, it appears to be hinting at some kind of metaphoric depiction of racial profiling by cops, with the humans and puppets living side by side, and the puppets appearing to bear the brunt of victimisation by the humans, but this is quickly abandoned, and instead it dives headlong into a story without much of a solid foundation, with lead star McCarthy just doing her usual loudmouth, profane fat girl act. It's sporadically funny, here and there, and to its credit doesn't rely on its novelty concept to evoke any of its laughs, its just not the sum of its parts.One that appeared to come and go pretty quickly from theatres, one doesn't sense a sequel coming, hence (or, Hense) its likely to disappear from the memory pretty quickly. **",The Happytime Murders
14,Edvis-1997,3,3,26 November 2018,Very boring comedy. Hardly even possible to call it comedy. Any of 90 minutes joke didn't make me laugh. They've tried but they failed miserably.,The Happytime Murders
15,bowmanblue,So good (but probably not for everyone),9,21 April 2019,"I didn't see 'The Happytime Murders' in the cinema, simply because it wasn't in there long enough for me to manage. I'm guessing it didn't stay long was something to do with the reviews - which were pretty poor to say the least.Brian (son on legendary 'Muppets' creator Jim) Henson creates a work where puppets co-exist with us 'normal' humans and yet are kind of considered 'second class citizens' - possibly due to them being filled with fluff, constantly wanting to engage in mass song and dance routines and, in some cases, hopelessly addicted to sugar. However, if you've seen any of his father's work, you may be thinking you're going to get some sort of light-hearted, family-friendly, happy-go-lucky adventure to keep the kids entertained. Oh how wrong you would be. In fact... this film should probably never be shown to children (which is most likely one of the main reasons it failed, commercially).Despite the (literally) colourful cast of puppet-characters, 'The Happytime Murders' is definitely for adults only. Expect violent murder (as the title refers to), puppet-sex (which makes the 'love scene' from 'Team America: World Police' seem tame) and plenty of snorting lines of purple powder. And all that is why I think it's become one of my favoutite films of recent times.Melissa McCarthy is the main human lead. I know some of her films can be a bit 'hit of miss' (and the 'Ghostbusters' remake didn't help), but - don't worry - she's back on form here. The only thing that doesn't go in her favour is the fact that she's totally upstaged by the film's 'true' star - the blue-faced puppet 'Phil Philman' who, despite being made out of material and clearly operated by puppeteers' hands, somehow manages to convey more expression and range of emotion than most of the human actors working in Hollywood right now. In a matter of minutes you'll probably actually forget that he's not real and get behind him as you would with any protagonist.So many recent 'comedies' (note the quote marks?) barely get me to raise a smile. Yet in 'The Happytime Murders' I'd go as far as to say that almost all the jokes land and hit their mark. Believe it or not, many of the gags are pretty well thought out and only really can work in a film about puppets. Plus you also have a bit more of a subtle take on prior racial inequalities where puppets are seen as a 'sub-class' of society. However, this kind of message is never blatant enough to appear 'preachy' and get in the way of the film's true purpose - to make you laugh.For me, the film was pretty much close to perfect, but I do understand that it's not for everyone. It's vulgar (see the silly-string gag), crude and some may say distasteful, plus 'puppets for adults' is always going to be a 'niche film' to sell to the masses. Basically, you're either going to love or hate it. Possibly best to really be sure that you're into some sick and twisted stuff like this before you sit down to watch. If I had to compare 'The Happytime Murders' to another film, I'd say 'Ted/Ted 2,' simply because both take (traditionally) children's characters and make them crude, vulgar and for adults only (and are all the better for doing so).",The Happytime Murders
16,ThomasDrufke,Troubling Comedy,3,6 September 2018,"Not that I really expected much out of this crass rated R puppet movie, but I was hoping to laugh a little bit. The first hour or so produced a few decent chuckles, but then it turns into a detective mystery story, which actually made for a much better film than the raunchy first few acts promised. But the lack of humor and tone switching wasn't the only thing wrong with The Happytime Murders. The arc of the lead character, voiced by Bill Barretta, is troublesome to say the least. Without spoiling much, he's troubled by the accidental death he caused, and his redemption involves him causing another death, which is an interesting message your sending the audience. All of these make for an underwhelming experience and an unpleasant one, to be kind.3.8/10",The Happytime Murders
17,lesleyharris30,"Could have Broken Boundaries, but It's Just Okay,",6,11 February 2019,"The Happytime Murders is a decent movie with a flawed script that does have its moments and a solid cast that make the best of it. Personally, I do not think this movie deserves the annhilation it has received from critics, I think it has a lot of good about it, I personally thought Melissa McCarthy taking on a role very different from her usual typecast, playing a straighter, more stern police officer, was very interesting to see and she did a great job. I also thought Bill Barretta was terrific as Phil Phillips, taking on a challenging role in that he is, of course, a puppet, but not particularly flamboyant or eccentric. I feel he deserves more credit for what he did with the part, he made him human, there were parts where I genuinely forgot I was watching a puppet. The puppeteering all around was terrific, Brian Henson and the rest of the Jim Henson Company did a great job of creating a universe co-inhabited by puppets and humans.It does fodder in several areas, the actual mystery aspect of the film is immensely weak, it never managed to surprise me or do anything interesting with this fun concept of puppets trying to solve a crime. It also never gave me a reason to care about the Happytime Gang, who should have been established from the get go, but instead are immediately tossed to the side and then later on I am expected to care about them as characters.It also has far too many unnecessarily sexual and explicit moments, the worse one of which features in the trailer, that just felt like they were doing it for a reaction and not for any other reason. there was never an authentic or potent point for them being there.Stumbles, but is consistently entertaining. Immensely flawed, it is very unfortunate how mediocre The Happytime Murders is, cause it could have changed the game for puppet films, but it is consistently fun, and an older generation of fans of The Jim Henson Company's Work will appreciate it.

18,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,6 December 2018,"The Happytime MurdersThe simplest way to murder a puppet is to sever the hand shoved up its ass.However, the murderer in this comedy has more elaborate eliminations in mind.When googly eyed cast members of The Happytime Gang sitcom start dropping dead, Phil, a dishonoured puppet cop turned PI, must re-team with his human ex-partner Connie (Melissa McCarthy) to find the killer. But as the felt bodies pile up the FBI (Joel McHale) start sniffing around and Phil finds himself the prime suspect. Now, Connie and Phil's sectary (Maya Rudolph) must prove his innocence.While the concept of an R-rated Muppet Show from Jim Henson's son sounds provocative, the end result is anything but.

Much of this, has to do with the comedy. The shock value of seeing puppets use vulgar sentences kinda ran dry, really quick, as they didn't do anything really new or clever with the harsh language. Because of that, much of the bawdy humor, sex addled jokes and over the top violence felt generic & unoriginal. After all, we seen humor like this, done better in films like 1989's 'Meet the Feebles' or 2004's 'Team America: World Police' that already pushed the envelope for raunchy humor in otherwise children oriented formats. As for the other jokes, unrelated to the puppet, they also didn't stand out much on their own. The 1992's film, 'Basic Instinct' legs crossing scene & other film parodies has been done to death, in other cop comedies like 1993's 'Loaded Weapon'. Even sayings, like 'dumb person say what' or 'does this smell like chloroform' like the ones use toward the FBI in the film has been used before; in films, as recent as 2011's 'Hall Pass'. They don't really stand that much as unique, smart comebacks. Because of that, most of the juvenile foul mouthed toilet humor jokes fall flat, rather than major hits toward the funny bone. It didn't help that the direction of the film was all over the place. The movie would certainly have more laughs, if the comedy had more a solid gritty film noir tone, rather than playing both sides. Another thing that would help the film is if they set the settling of the events to the late 1970s & early 1980s, where puppets were used, often, in their peak, in the entertainment industry as modern day minstrel shows, lampooning them, in stereotypical and often disparaging ways, as musical, childish, buffoons. All that negative overexposure and saturation would give more reasons, in universe, for people to hate them, & treat the live hand puppets, as second class citizens. Without that, key information, the film's social commentary about race racial doesn't make much lick of sense. The world building for this alternate Los Angeles didn't feel as real as it could had been. It was lazy. To top it off, the film feature, way too many mediocre comedians, rather than dramatic performers. It doesn't make the grittiest parts of the film seem believable. After all, McCarthy's female Chris Farley's fat person doing pratfalls lighthearted gags doesn't really match, well, with the somber dark comedy, they're trying to tell. To add to that, her style of physical humor had already ran its course. Jokes involving her character, out of place puppet's kidney were a bit tiresome to watch. Despite that, she isn't that much of a nuisance. McCarthy is amusing enough to care, and she shares some fun chemistry with Phil. Nevertheless, the worst performance in the film by an actor, has to go to Joel McHale as Agent Campbell. He's pretty much, playing himself. It is so disappointing, as he adds nothing to the film. On the other hand, it's the voice acting for the puppets that really do shine. For example, Barretta really did a great job, here. I enjoyed his character, quite a bit. He made the puppet seem like a real dark disheveled gritty cop, through his gruff masculine voice. I also like how film argues that puppets are complex & flawed living beings whom also could go through rough times. To add to the context, some of the puppets used in this film was recycle from past productions like 1994's TV Series, 'The Animal Show' and 2002's film 'Kermit's Swamp Years' to show the wear and tear of aging and outliving their usefulness. It made the dark elements of the story seem a little more tragic. However, this choice in production also cheapens it, by making the film seem low budget, when it's not. It's sad, because you can tell that there is a lot of passion behind this movie. Apparently, they've been trying to make this motion picture for years now. It was kinda a dream assignment for director, Brian Henson. He really thought, this flick would led to more adult themed movie projects like a film version of his United Kingdom's puppet based variety show, 'Puppet Up!'; by this point, that most likely isn't going to happen. Despite that, the puppeteers put a lot a work into this movie. They went through a lot of hardship based off, the outtakes during the credits, trying to their green screen body suits, oscillating machine, and hydraulics to work right. Unfortunately, Jim Henson's son indeed reaches a new low here to the point, that it kinda hurt the Henson Family legacy, because how mediocre, the film story is. Don't get me wrong, the murder mystery concept isn't bad; I just wish, they took more challengers with it. I found it, oddly constructed, yet prediction. Nevertheless, they are points of the film where twists do happen, but they have no emotional weight or payoff. Much of them, like the one with Jenny (Elizabeth Banks) don't really play much of a factor. Also, there were a lot of jarring moments, like why didn't Phil work with the FBI. At least, he would had alibi, when the other murders do happen. I guess, it was done to add some thrills. Regardless of that, not needed add in, the movie is still paced very well. Overall: This movie is not good, but at least, it's not a total mess of a crash dummy of a film like some critics, make it out to be. It's just meh. Could had been better.",The Happytime Murders

23,cruise01,Boring and the crude humor lacked in being funny and just a wasted time.,2,7 December 2018,"The Happytime Murders (1 out of 5 stars).The Happytime Murders is by far the worst comedy crime film that can ever be made. Surely, hope parents do not mistake this for a kids movie cause there are puppets in it. A plot about puppets coexisting with humans and Melissa McCarthy and a detective puppet Phil trying to solve a crime as someone is murdering puppets. It is a raunchy comedy film so expect a lot of sex humor, drugs, and stupidity. I did not once find the movie at all funny. It was a dull boring direction. I may have laughed once during the whole thing and it was in the end for some stupid humor. Plot was boring. Direction was dull. The humor was eh. Melissa McCarthy may be a wasted talent on this film. And the puppeteering and visual effects are not impressive at all.Overall, The Happytime Murders is a terrible comedy film. Definitely a pass. Even the gag reel in the credits was just terrible and not funny.",The Happytime Murders
24,eddie_baggins,Worse than you'd feared!,1,27 August 2018,"I'm fairly certain no one expected The Happytime Murders to be a good film, but I'm also fairly certain no one expected this puppets gone bad film to be this bad.Stuck in development hell for a number of years, in which it had seen such stars as Cameron Diaz come and depart, Happytime see's legendary puppet/Muppet master Jim Henson's son Brian direct this adult's only comedy that fails to ignite in any single way thanks to a cringe-worthy script, fascination with low-common denominator jokes and another unfunny lead turn from the increasingly frustrating comedic antics of ""star"" Melissa McCarthy.Directing his first feature film in many a moon (and quite possibly his last based on this effort), Henson can't bring the crass-filled good times as we follow disgraced former puppet cop turned private eye Bill Barretta investigating a series of murders connected to the cast members of one time hit television show The Happytime Gang that also forces the alcoholic P.I to re-team with his one-time partner Connie Edwards (McCarthy), who plays her role exactly how you'd expect her to, which means lots of yelling, loud-mouth behaviour with sprinkling's of generally unlikeable tendencies which help make Happytime more of a chore than an enjoyment to sit through.Most frustratingly, it's not hard to see where Happytime could've become a poor man's Team America, the idea of a world filled with working-class puppets marginalised by us humans has potential, while the actual investigation into who is killing off the Happytime Gang could've been of interest but the whole film lacks heart, soul or energy, giving off the feeling that everyone involved here really couldn't have cared less about how the end product turned out.99% of the jokes in the film fall flat and are delivered even flatter, while a continual focus of the comedy elements of the film being either around puppet sex or drugs doesn't exactly make for an appealing time out at the movies, with McCarthy's eye-rollingly bad turn a shoe-in for next year's Razzie Awards for worst female actress.After breaking out as a feature film star in Bridesmaids in 2011, McCarthy's career as operated on a continuous downward trend and when you combine this appearance with her other recent outings in film's such as Life of the Party, Ghostbusters, The Boss and Tammy, it doesn't paint a pretty picture of an actress that has taken a particular persona and run it well and truly into the ground.Final Say - An overly dirty and unfunny so called ""comedy"", The Happytime Murders squanders its possible potential on a lame story that's poorly put together and poorly played out, making this a puppet picture that you should avoid at all costs, unless of course the idea of puppets getting their heads repeatedly blown off is your idea of a fun time out at the movies.½ a Maple Syrup bottle out of 5",The Happytime Murders
25,TheMovieDiorama,The Happytime Murders had me wishing I was getting stuffed (take that as you will).,3,29 August 2018,"What the fluff happened here? As transgressive as this premise was, with its rather pronounced social commentary, it failed on nearly every element. Not only was this boringly unfunny, but it felt like a chore just to sit through it and survive. Puppets and humans coexist in this world, where two disgraced detectives join forces to investigate ""The Happytime Murders"". A standard buddy cop film, except the twist is that one of the individuals is a puppet. The entirety of this premise relies on one simple gag. Innocent cute puppets performing adult acts. Including but not limited to: smoking, swearing, snorting glitter and ejaculating explosions of silly string. The crude humour dries up faster than a silly string filled sock. I was bored after ten minutes, and unsurprisingly nothing happens after that within it's predictably monotonous plot. A puppet in an adult shop? Someone call an ambulance, I'm dying from the lack of laughter. A puppet ejaculating for five minutes? I'm dead. Resuscitate me. Christ! The narrative infrequently touches upon the inferiority of puppets, indiscreetly likening this social context to perhaps racial discrimination in today's society. Maybe I'm reading too much into it as I try to find positives. Alas, that is where the intelligence to this screenplay ends. McCarthy plays the exact same character once again. Y'know, got to be the centre of attention and all that. I'm starting to wonder if she can actually act. Rudolph brought a few smirks to my cold dead face with her accentuated quirky characters. Also, the puppetry was excellent, an art form with plenty of technical ability that I just have to admire. But that's where the praise ends. Stupidly unfunny with far too much focus on its own vulgarity. Brian Henson attempted a new approach to his father's infamous puppetry, but sadly it didn't work. Move on. If a ""comedy"" nearly made me fall asleep, then you know it's bad. Urgh, Muppets this is not.",The Happytime Murders
26,pmtelefon,Close but no cigar,5,14 January 2021,"I guess Director Brian Henson and company deserve an E for effort for ""The Happytime Murders"". There is a pretty good movie in there somewhere. The problem with this movie is that it aims high with the premise but aims low (very low) with the jokes. It ends up being just a bit too crude, a bit too vulgar, to be fun. The human cast is strong. The voice over work is also solid. It's just that they're stuck doing low-grade material. If I was sixteen years old and hanging out with my friends, ""The Happytime Murders"" would have been a laugh riot. Still, it had its share of laughs.

27,videorama-759-859391,Not the happiest chap,6,13 September 2018,"I agree with reviewer one, about how previews falselyy savor those cinematic appetites. It's happened with as couple of films, I've come to view in my life, this one, the latest. I expected continual loud laughs, that may'be would surpass, the much high laugh ratio of Ted. But really, this has nothing on Ted, except for offering it's own perverted, disgusting style and bit of crime noir. With previews to movie's that let down the viewer, not just comedy, they'll cram all the best bits in. As this is kind of what I felt here. But that aside, this is one of the most original and colorful films of the year. There are some great perversely inventive lines, and the main puppet character, Phil, is a guy you really like. It's not too welcoming to be a puppet amongst humans, as he tells another puppet, 'It's their world, we just live in it"". It'd be great to imagine this world in reality. You really feel like saying 'Fair Go Of The Puppet"". Puppet Phil was once, L.A'S finest, now of course, a PI, or private d..k, as some people like to refer to em'. Some maniac is going around shooting puppets from a 70's t.v.,show, the second one happening to be Phil's brother, so now we share Phil's vengeance, and are on the hunt. To his disgruntlement, he's teamed up with an ex partner/friend/human (McCarthy) great lead for this film, and the investigation begins, painting the film as a thriller. The letdown factor is comedy, but take that away, you still got a engrossing and curious puppet pic, where the handling of the puppets and locations, dives, whatever, was really impressive. There are a few laughs, mind you, but it's adult, humour, and there really are some crafty lines that are gold. Some things in the film, you never see coming, and as to the killer's motives, kind of sucked, but isn't what you suspect. I would be lying, if I said I wasn't disappointed by THM, but at least, it's not a huge disappointment. I'm glad I came and went. No pun intended.

It's good for a few giggles, but it's not as funny as I hoped. It seems like I may have McCarthy on too high of a Pedestal these days cause I was expecting to get knocked out of the park when all I got was a bunt. This had a lot to do with the fact that the movie really focus on the puppets more than the humans and Melissa McCarthy was just a famous face they could put on the poster next top a blue puppet. It has it's moments of real messed up giggles (puppets having sex, puppets getting their face blown off and my favorite, a puppet who gets surgery to look more human), plus it's another team up between McCarthy and Maya Rudolph, but It's barely holding a candle top what McCarthy was attached to in the past.",The Happytime Murders

This is a comedy with puppets but do not take any kids to see it. It is an adult comedy-lots of language and sex scenes-that is directed by Brian Henson, the son of Jim Henson. It's as if Brian took over his father's legacy and decided to just go wild and make a funny 'R' rated movie. It takes place in a world where humans and puppets co-exist in, kind of like it was portrayed in 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. Melissa/human & Bill/puppet used to be partners on the police force until an accident causes Bill to find another job as a private investigator. Maya is Bill's secretary. When the cast of a children's tv show-comprised of puppets and one human, Elizabeth-start being killed off one by one, Bill and Melissa have to team up again to solve the case. I thought it was very funny. Be warned though. There is lots of language and sex, although it is puppets, it is pretty graphic. Look for Melissa's husband to make a cameo-he is one of Melissa's office co-workers. As the end credits start, there are some bloopers and outtakes shown.
It's rated ""R"" for drug use, language and sexual content-including graphic sex scenes with puppets-and has a running time of 1 hour & 31 minutes.

33,GiraffeDoor,Who framed the Feebles: World Police.,7,17 April 2020,"Enjoyable yarn (no pun intended; no seriously) that rehashes a classic movie formula (the film noir) and gives it a gimmicky twist. It could have been trashy and cheap but they really put the best people (and differently Fabricated Individuals) on the job so the whole thing is astonishingly convincing as the two worlds blend as majestically as Roger Rabbit while still maintaining its own identity as a show. It impressed me how you see a lot of long takes of puppets walking with legs in full show. It's handled so well that none of the magic is lost when they show some of the behind the scenes stuff.You might feel the gag of taking trangressive material and just sort of puppetizing it would get old (puppets don't become crack heads, but sugar heads; even though it's shown they have a much higher tolerance for sweet things than humans). But I didn't.The main character is the right balance of hard boiled and likable in spite of being an ex-cop. We have what I thought was a pretty poignant narrative of redemption, discrimination and the mending of shattered friendships even if it was a bit randomly incest-negative.Predictable to a degree but the plot is still intriguing and engaging. The script plays around with racial tensions and the linguistic minefield they present rather cleverly. They respected the audience enough to not beat us over the head with the message that ""racism is bad"".You could do so much worse if you just want a bit of fun.",The Happytime Murders

The puppeteering is great, with some amazing designs, and an impressive amount of situations they put these puppets into. Even with the help of green screen special effects, the film never feels off in those moments, and is quite a talent to feat for puppet work in films and entertainment. The film is largely entertaining, providing a decently fun ride, accompanied by a surprising amount of jokes that actually land- and almost every time as well. That being said, the film does feel a bit rushed in its delivery, making things seem a bit hectic and forced to actually tie together in one film. The film can also feel a bit uneven at times, and doesn't necessarily hit the film hard, but feels a lot more weary than it could be. The story is, needless to say, a bit all over the place and somewhat ridiculous, but if you don't take it too seriously, it can be rather easy to enjoy. In the end, The Happytime Murders is far from a homerun, but it is a surprisingly decent time- with enough jokes and humor to land- not to mention it's pretty entertaining- that make it sure enough of a fun journey to sit through.

40,questl-18592,The Very Sadtime Movie,2,24 December 2020,"I am not a huge McCarthy fan but, like so many others I was drawn to this movie because of my deep love and nostalgia for Who Framed Roger Rabbit. A movie set in a world where humans coincide with things from a kids show acting in a more mature fashion? Yeah, ok, I'm curious. Obviously I'd heard the talk, read the bad reviews. EVERYONE said this was bad but that almost makes the curiosity worse just because of how bad people made it out to be. So, how does it actually hold up?Yeah, it's bad.But! It's not AS bad as people have made it out to be. I have absolutely seen worse things than this. Looking at you Jexi.The problem here boils down to the screenplay. There is potential here to make a cutting satire of culture, race and minority/police relations but nope, lets stick to dumb, frat boy poop, sex and drug jokes. It doesn't even remotely try to elevate anything, it takes aim at the lowest common possible point and hits it every single time. I mean, in a sense, KUDOS! You hit your mark movie, but maybe next time aim a little bit higher. Not every film needs to have be a scathing indictment on our socio-political landscape or have some subtle message on the dangers of persecution but I could go my whole life without another movie where the color of a puppet's pubic hair is a key plot point.Credit to McCarthy though. I'm not a fan of hers but she's trying here. She's given absolute garbage to work with but she's trying to make it into something worth a chuckle.So basically I'm in agreement with the internet. This is a bad movie. Don't let your curiosity draw you in though because honestly it's not bad enough to be one of those movies that's so bad they've looped back around to being funny again.

True, the puppets have dealt with lots of adult issues, but never did I think Jim Henson would see his creations dive into the world of tonight's film. Traditional lines are blurred as the modern meets the classic, twisting it into a new creation that holds loads of ""potential"". Can the dark, murder mystery with puppets be awesome, or is it a Robot Chicken parody that falls flat on its' face. Robbie K here to bring his thoughts on the first movie of the week, as he reviews: Movie: The Happytime Murders (2018)Director:
 Brian Henson
Writers:
 Todd Berger (screenplay by), Todd Berger (story by) 
Stars:
 Melissa McCarthy, Elizabeth Banks, Maya Rudolph
LIKES:The Soundtrack: A soundtrack can make or break a part of the movie, and surprisingly this film succeeds in this aspect. The music director picked a great variety of songs that help add some pep to the scenes, while also adding some comedy to the routine as well. A well-timed pop song comes in at the most awkward times, while other songs mesh well with the theme of the scene. The Acting: Not award-winning roles, but the human cast succeeds in playing their roles and working alongside a puppet cast. Melissa McCarthy certainly gives justice to her immense screen time, and Maya Rudolph cleans up the scenes very well with her style of comedy. The other secondary humans accomplish their goals as well, but it is these two who hold most of the human work. In regards to the voice acting, too many voice actors to call out, but man did they bring their characters to life and capture the spirit of the Muppets as well. Obviously the main puppet gets the most credit, but the others all bring the energy of puppets.  The Humor (at times): You know there is a lot crammed into this movie in terms of jokes, and while not everything was a hit for me, it certainly had its moments that shined like, glittery pieces of felt. Happytime murders gets props for clever pokes at popular culture, melding the modern-day crime obsession with the comedy of the kids puppet shows. It's these moments of clever content meeting the well-timed punch, while delivering with awesome voice acting that had me laughing the most. The Mystery: For a giant farce, the movie surprisingly has a good mystery at hand. Predictable at times, the Happytime Murders have a cold hard case of murder, crime, and drama to try and uncover. It dives deep and provides all the details in a nice format to help you solve the crime at hand. Surprisingly, this was the component that kept me the most intrigued, almost like the rest of America and the trend of consistent crime dramas. The Puppeteering: You knew this was coming, but Happytime Murders gets my biggest nod for continuing the art of telling stories through puppet work. Jim Henson's vision is alive and well, and the spirit of the arts is working strong in the number of stunts/scenes they put the main puppet through. Dynamic motions are in Phil's arsenal and with it they pulled out all the stops to make them flow in design and execution. I agree, it's not the grandest work that we've seen come out of Henson studios, but it is still a fantastic display nonetheless. 
DISLIKES:Crossing the Line: The humor components are funny at times, but other times go a little over the top in their journey for a laugh. Happytime Murders gets a red label for a reason and heed their warnings about not taking kids, for there are many things they should not see. Sure, the impressionable minds will pick up on the curse laden dialogue, but some lines will be a little grosser than funny for some Again, I'll admit that they had me laughing at moments, but other times made me cringe in discuss. Underutilization of characters: This is mainly towards the human characters, but Happytime murders really struggles to maximize the human cast more than they do. This is especially true for the detectives and Elizabeth Banks, for these characters had some hard-hitting scenes, but often were left in the background. Why not use them more? I guess they needed some more puppet time, but still... maybe some better integration. Deeper Dive Into Story: The mystery is there, and all the clues are in the details, but this movie did slack a little on the story. It was almost as if they had taken a mystery/crime series and mashed them together to make a piecemeal mystery. There was deeper storytelling and use of these puppets waiting in the wings, but for the laughs and all the clever puppet design, these elements were sacrificed. Perhaps a second installment will dive into more, but much of the limitations come from the fact that they didn't balance the other characters more than they did. The Trailers: Another example of a movie ruined by the trailers, Happytime murders suffers from the combination of a short run time and much of the funny being spoiled in the advertising. If you have seen at least two of the trailers, you have much of the heart of this movie revealed in regards to the comedy. In addition, there are some hard clues in the trailer itself, so you've been warned to skim around the trailers as you best see fit. 
The VERDICT:  Happytime murders accomplishes its goal of being the inappropriate R rated Muppets show that some have longed for. The clever, creativity, and adulteration are certainly a unique spin, and it brings its brand of comedy out in full force. In this age where computers rule and puppeteers are left in the dust, this movie certainly proves this art can still be entertaining. The bad news is that the movie's short run time is one of the key weaknesses to the dislikes I mentioned, primarily in the trailers ruining much of the surprise and the storytelling needing more time to actually expand out. Nevertheless, I admit this movie is fun to watch at times, but... it probably doesn't merit a trip to theater. My scores are: Action/Comedy/Crime: 6.0

(R)Take ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" multiply by ""Meet the Feebles,"" subtract all charm and laughter. Set in a world that inexplicably finds mankind and puppetkind living together in civilized society, McCarthy (human) and Barretta (puppet), former partners on the police force, reluctantly team up to solve a series of murders that are targeting former stars of a television program called ""The Happytime Gang."" Consists primarily of humdrum detective work, chemistry-free buddy cop rapport, and a heavy peppering of dirty jokes that nine-year-olds may find hysterical (few of which don't feel forced for the sake of shock value). The puppet work is pretty solid (this does come from a division of The Jim Henson Company, after all), but their integration with humans is never convincing; the occasional attempt to supply a racism metaphor always lands with a resounding thud.

Its brisk running time of 78 minutes makes it a quick sit, and it doesn't linger on any comic set piece too long (save for maybe a puppet sex scene that falls flat). The puppetry is impressive on a technical level and the movie does a good job of bringing to life its sleazy world of puppets and humans, but its reliance on shock humor makes some stretches rather tedious to sit through. Maybe if The Happytime Murders had been made before the glut of The Hangover clones flooded cineplexes for 10 years it might've been able to have a more lasting impression, but as is it's a comedy with a few chuckles, some decent puppet effects, and not much lasting impact.",The Happytime Murders

52,aciessi,Disconnecting the Rainbow.,4,25 August 2018,"The Happytime Murders should have been the ""stuff"" of legends. Wacka wacka! But in all fairness, a lowdown and dirty puppet movie by the heir to the Henson throne is something that could have been hilarious, shocking and infectiously inventive. Sure, this concept is certainly not uncharted waters. Peter Jackson, during his early B-Movie years, made a nasty film called ""Meet the Feebles"" which was essentially The Muppet Movie dumped into a colostomy bag. In the early 2000's, Sesame Street got the midnight treatment on Broadway with Avenue Q, which explored such adult themes through the majesty of jolly PBS variety jingles. There is even, if you can believe it, a 1970's pornographic film called ""Let My Puppets Come"" where humans and puppets get it on. Don't ever search it out. Curiosity or otherwise, just don't do it. So what can The Happytime Murder's offer? Perhaps a raucous parody of Muppet lore, spanning from Kermit to Big Bird, and sending up the entire fascinating and even dark world of puppeteering? My kingdom for a film that smart. Unfortunately, Happytime is less like Roger Rabbit and more like Cool World.This movie is brought to you by the letter L. A big L for lazy. Wit is seemingly replaced with endless genitalia humor, and not even the good variety. The murder-mystery of the film goes nowhere and nowhere fast either, as you're left stunned by the sluggish exposition of it's characters. Melissa McCarthy is cast in what is largely a thankless role that could have been played by anyone. Replace her with Seth Rogen and the film would have been no different. She shares only a share of screen time with a Ray Liotta-esque detective puppet named Phil Phillips, who from time to time cracked me a big smile as a gritty veteran cop juxtaposed with a cute and cuddly blue Muppet. There seems to be a world where humans and puppets co-exist, and suffer racial strife (ala Roger Rabit) which is hinted at in the beginning but never materializes into a real underlying message for the story. Perhaps it would have been too obvious and cliched, but don't start something you can't finish. I was sort of bothered by the fact that they all walked on two legs, like humans. Wouldn't it have been much funnier to have them seen from the waist up? Addressing the fact that a human is controlling them from below, never to break free? Historical allegories abound? I know, too smart. The stars of Happytime Gang gets whacked one by one, but the problem is, we never get to see the transition between lovable Puppet celebrities and the drug-infused, Hollywood style downward spiral that led to their demise. The possibilities for that? Well, it almost kills me to know how much could have been done there and wasn't. I loved looking at these puppets and the amount of heart that went into the designs of all of them. Little shreds of comedic genius kept me watching. There is an amazing film that is begging to climb out of here. But only half of it exists. It's time to face the music, time to turn off the lights, because the Happytime Murders never gets things started.",The Happytime Murders
53,rockman182,The Happytime Murders (2018),6,27 August 2018,"This film garnered early negative press by being sued because of its Sesame Street related tagline. Of course, any type of publicity is good publicity so I was interested in checking this film out. A world where humans and puppets live together but in a much more R rated scope is something that should be great, on paper at least. Then again, the addition of Melissa McCarthy gets a mixed reaction from me as more often than not I dislike her films. This film has humor that is scattered, and a plot that is predictable, but it turned out to be better than I thought.The film is about a puppet private investigator/ex-detective who becomes involved in the murders of former puppet stars of the TV show, The Happytime Gang."" While trying to solve the case and clear his own name he reunites with his former partner (Melissa McCarthy) as they together try to unravel the mystery of the hits on the puppets. Puppets are also looked down on in the world of this film, which makes life for a bunch of puppets difficult.There are a few funny moments scattered here and there that I got a good laugh out of. As you would expect, the films content is raunchy and don't expect it to be light. Cow jerk off porn, puppet pubic hair, puppets tweaking and offering oral sex, the works. The film does have moments that are meant to be funny but don't garner much of an audience reaction. I thought McCarthy was decent in this. The films plot is somewhat predictable which I felt detracts from what could have been accomplished with the film.I thought side roles in the film did help out with the films entertainment and humor, namely through Maya Rudolph and Joel McHale. The film tries its best to be raunchy and offensive but doesn't really feel memorable and won't have a longstanding impact. It felt like Netflix's Bright but obviously a less somber and stupid version. I admire the idea and the work taken to put the puppets to screen but the film still feels familiar and does not make it up with enough humor to make it a future favorite.6/10",The Happytime Murders
54,RforFilm,The Happytime Murders is a forgettable comedy with a recycled Roger Rabbit plot and boring characters,3,27 August 2018,"Movies that take childish ideas like cartoons or kid friendly content and put them in adult, R rated stories have a lot of courage to go against the typical tropes. We just don't see many of these movies as their hard to sell. Though Ted is the one that broke the tradition, stuff like Death to Smoochy, Drop Dead Fred, and Silent Night, Deadly Night have resulted in controversy and usually, low box office grossings. Where do they go wrong? It usually meets an odd line where it's intention to remain childish ends up coming out too silly for a mainstream audience to take seriously. Does this mean they need to have a more serious tone? It really depends on a lot of factors.In the case of todays movie, we have an R rated movies starting Muppets... or because Disney owns that term, puppets. This isn't the first time we've seen this as the musical Avenue Q had already taken similar puppets and put them into a grittier, more adult world. People seemed to connect with that as even the puppet characters still had personalities that regular, out of college individuals had and could relate to. Lets see if The Happytime Murders can replicate a similar response. In a world where humans and puppets coexist, an ex-cop, private detective puppet Phil Phillips (played by Bill Barretta) tries to go about his life and job, even with the discrimination he faces. He receives a client who's receiving threatening letters. When he's lead to a porn shop for names, he just misses a shooting that takes down a former rabbit cast member on an older sitcom, The Happytime Gang. 
Things are taken a step further when Phil's brother is murdered, also a cast member, shortly after. TO curtail further murder attempts, he's hired to work with his former partner, an LAPD detective, Connie Edwards (played by Melissa McCarthy).The two don't get along, due to her prejudice, but know they have to remain professional. They go to each surviving cast member of The Happytime Game including it's only human actor, a burlesque dancer Jenny (played by Elizabeth Banks). The further they go, the more they realize that the killer just might be in front of their eyes and there may be a larger motive involved. Will each side learn to understand each other?Does a lot of this sound familiar? That's because the idea of a cop and puppet/cartoon/stereotype teaming up had already been done in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. There's nothing wrong with using that plot if they can come up with something new...and they don't. It's just an excuse to see how many times they can get puppets to swear and show having sex. Maybe ten years ago, this would have been shocking, but what we see is no more typical then what I would find on Family Guy, Rick and Morty, and just about anything on Adult Swim. The jokes feel lazy, cheap, and just more shocking then funny.The characters are also without a paddle. What's weird about this buddy cop set up is that there are two hard-nose personalities. Since they both think similar with their dark perspective on life, there's very little conflict outside of their prejudice. Imagine if the puppet working with the detective had a personality like Cookie Monster, Fozzie Bear or even Kermit. That would have been way funnier and developed a bigger conflict for the human. Even so, Melissa McCarthy's character has little reason or rhyme, who is willing to do drugs and sleep on her face like in Bridesmaids, despite how she's trying to play more serious.Because of this, The Happytime Murders is boring. Again, I had looked to Who Framed Roger Rabbit as hope the world would be cool to look at. But the Los Angeles here looks exactly like ours...just with puppets looking around. It's clear that its budget was spent on the puppets as you'd think there'd be more history to influence. Yet because of this restriction, it's hard to tell how position of power works between these characters or why there's even prejudice to begin with. Why are puppets second-class citizens? I just don't get much of an answer.I'll give this three Avenue Q posters out of ten. I have to give some credit to Brain Henson (yes, he is a son of the late Jim Henson) who still knows how to do some neat Muppet effects and even show their legs (walking, fighting, driving a car, etc...). I might have laughed a couple of times, but I don't remember why. This is why character is always so important, especially in comedies. If your looking for something adult, skip this and go see Avenue Q instead.",The Happytime Murders

57,bob-the-movie-man,Why did some muppet green light this?,3,7 September 2018,"Man, this is grim.The Happytime Murders is set in LA where puppets and humans live together but without much harmony, in a somewhat clumsy parody of racism. In this setting Phil Philips (voiced by Muppets regular Bill Barretta) is a disgraced ex-cop puppet - the first of his kind -drummed out of the force for an indiscretion and now making ends meet as a PI.But someone is progressively bumping off members of ""Happy Time"" - an old muppet-style show on the Puppet Television Network featuring Phil's old flame Jenny (Elizabeth Banks). When a murder hits home close to Pete, he teams with his old police partner Connie (Melissa McCartney) to catch the murderer.One problem with this film is that the concept - rude puppets - is not new: ""Avenue Q"" have done this way better on stage and ""Team America: World Police"" on film. So from the outset the content doesn't really shock. But the worst problem is that for adults, the screenplay by Todd Berger is just NOT FUNNY ENOUGH. It's a bad sign when you can count the moments you moved from a smile to a light chuckle on one hand: just three times in fact (with the silly string scene, with the wringing-out scene (""look away"") and with a parody of a famous interrogation scene).So, based on the 'laffs-per-minute' count, this is 90 minutes of my life I'd like back please. Actually, if you cut out the regular swearing and came up with a suitable story about silly string, then - cartoon puppet violence and all - the kids might enjoy it much more!The only other mildly entertaining aspect for me - which grudgingly earns it an extra star - were the closing titles that showed how some of it was filmed.McCarthy delivers much of the same shtick we've seen from her in all of her recent movie outings, which doesn't really wash well with me anymore. Banks is good as the love interest Jenny, but has little to do. It's directed by Brian Henson, son of the late and great Jim Henson. I'm all for ""experiments"", and I notice that this was released under the ""Henson Alternative"" brand, which is perhaps appropriate, but some experiments work and some just don't. I personally think this is one that doesn't extend the Henson brand and needs to be quietly forgotten with a line drawn under it. Definitely NOT recommended. If someone asks you to go to the cinema with them to see this, I would suggest you tell them to get stuffed!",The Happytime Murders

61,CANpatbuck3664,A Movie That Ends up in the Middle Despite a Ton of Potential,6,25 August 2018,"The people responsible for these puppets include some famous names with Brian Henson (Jim Henson's son) directing The Happytime Murders with The Jim Henson Company doing the puppeteering for the puppet characters. The biggest compliment I can give The Happytime Murders is that the puppets look great and they perform great. Each character has a unique design and even when the movie hit its lowest points, the fact that they were bringing some crazy character in the next scene kept me interested. While I wouldn't stack it up against Hollywood's biggest action franchises, I though the action with the puppets was surprisingly well done. It didn't look as awkward as I was expecting it to and despite some dodgy CGI (there's a car bombing that looks fake as $%**) the movie is shot well overall. They brought in somebody who had a lot of experience working with this style of entertainment and I think he and his team performed capably.If you read into the production of this movie, it was developed for 10+ years with several other stars and directors attached. I respect the passion to finally get The Happytime Murders made and the movie had some definite strengths (the puppets and the puppeteering being the biggest). The biggest disappointment was that they needed to spend some of this time punching up the script. There are plenty of funny moments but there are some jokes/bits that are so painfully awkward that I found myself turning away from the screen. The overall mystery fit the bill (even if it wasn't anything special) but the movie is pretty predictable when you start examining the plot. Sure, this is poking fun at noir and the tropes/clichés that show up in the genre while still functioning as a noir film, but that balance is so hard to achieve, and this movie can't walk that line. It just comes down to this movie not really capitalizing on the potential of what they set up. I walked away from The Happytime Murders satisfied but at the same time, I couldn't help but be disappointed.If you're sickened or turned off by the trailer for The Happytime Murders, don't go see this. The flavour of the movie's humour is decidedly sour, and the movie flaunts how raunchy it is. The sense of humour doesn't change or fluctuate, and this works sporadically. There are moments where the movie had me laughing out loud (my favourite was probably the seedy poker game which is featured in the trailer) and yet there were times where my friend was covering her eyes. The Happytime Murders is a case of what you see is what you get, watch the marketing ahead of time and enter at your own risk.The internet seems to really despise Melissa McCarthy, so many were rooting for this to fail because of her involvement. I like Melissa but since her breakout in Bridesmaids, minus Spy (which if you haven't seen, go watch that instead) her output has ranged from mediocre to bad. I don't think she was exceptional in this and she stumbles when she's responsible for carrying the film, but I think she did a decent job considering what she had to work with. She's charismatic and funny in the right vehicle and while this isn't going to be a smash hit, its nice to see her trying different things out. I want to credit the voicework of Bill Barretta as Phil Phillips, he gets what he needs to do and while what he has to say isn't snappy enough, he delivers it capably and got the job done. I felt so sorry for the supporting actors and actresses in this movie, they brought in some real talent in to fill these nondescript parts that were beneath these people. Joel McHale and Elizabeth Banks get the worst of it, McHale isn't an A-list talent but he's just embarrassing himself here. Elizabeth Banks is very underrated as an actress, she's adept at both drama and comedy and I was shocked at how little quality material they gave her. I also felt bad for Maya Rudolph, but she at least gets a few moments elicit some laughs. She mostly suffers because of her character.I left the theatre not really knowing how to feel about this movie. On one hand, there were a few really funny scenes, the puppets were well designed, and the puppeteers performed well and the movie delivered on the trailer's promise of being really raunchy. But it never lives up to the full potential of the premise, for every hilarious bit, there's another one that's equally as awkward or unfunny and both the story and the jokes could have used some more work. Add on top of this the waste of some excellent supporting actors/actresses and the movie left me trying to decipher how to grade it on the drive back home. I can't recommend everyone seeing this in the theatre, although I'm more positive on The Happytime Murders, I can see why the critics railed against this. A large segment of the movie going population is going to be disgusted by this and they will hate it completely. If you love bizarre and quirky adult oriented material, The Happytime Murders might be your kind of film. I won't judge either way, I went to see this with a friend because of how crazy the trailer looked, and she largely had the same comments when we were discussing it after. Sometimes its actually hardest to review the movies that end up falling in the middle, there's just so much more material when something is a masterpiece or a complete piece of $#!T. In the case of The Happytime Murders, I have to split the difference and I begrudgingly give it a 6/10.",The Happytime Murders

63,jwwalrath-227-85487,Really funny,9,25 August 2018,"Yes, The Happytime Murders isn't the first raunchy puppet movie (Meet the Feebles) or even the first story to treat puppets as second-class citizens (the short-lived show Greg the Bunny). But it is hilarious, I laughed a lot.The film has a lot creatively insane jokes. Yet, despite the craziness, the film does have a decent plot to it. Though, admittedly it does have a lot of detective/noir cliches to it.The human cast is surprisingly good in this considering that they have to act with puppets most of the time. Melissa McCarthy, Elizabeth Banks, and Maya Rudolph all put in some of their better performances. In fact, I think this is the best I've seen Maya, who plays a goofy secretary. Credit should be given to veteran Muppet performer Bill Barretta (Pepe the Prawn) as the main character. He pulls off the unenviable job of making the main puppet character Phil come off as tough and gritty, albeit in a humorous way. Only downside to the acting in this is that the puppets' voices are performed by veteran puppeteers rather than cast outside voices and there are a couple of times where the puppeteers' voices weren't strong enough to fit the tone.Lastly, I really have to admire the technical effort put into this. A lot of effort is made to populate this world with multiple puppets, even if they're just in the background. It really sells the idea of a world populated with them. I haven't seen a puppet film that has had this many full-torso shots. If you don't like comedy that pushes the edge or is weird, this isn't for you. But I really recommend this if you like this sort of thing but aren't completely sold.",The Happytime Murders

67,sweidman-28016,Pretty Bad But Funny,3,28 October 2018,"The Happytime Murders Review:The Happytime Murders is a new raunchy comedy about a world where humans and puppets live together, but humans and puppets don't agree too well. When the stars of the show The Happytime Gang start to end up murdered, Detective Connie Edwards, Melissa McCarthy, and puppet Phil Phillips, Bill Barretta, must put aside their differences and solve the case. This movie is exactly what it sounds. It's just a comedy with a lot of offensive humor and a dumb plot. There's not much else to it. When I first heard about it I knew it wasn't going to be good, but I wanted to see it because it was one of those dumb movies that's really funny. Though the movie was pretty funny, it was very offensive humor and I wasn't sure if I should laugh at it or not. Mellissa McCarthy just played one of her typical characters, not much else to it. Bill Barretta was pretty funny as puppet Phil Phillips. I just think it's funny because he's been voice acting for the Muppets and he's doing something like this. Maya Rudolph plays Phil's dumb secretary, Bubbles. I know she's supposed to be dumb and annoying but I just really hated her so much. Same with Elizabeth Banks's character, Jenny, who is a stripper. She just felt annoying for the little she was on there. Puppet Sandra, Dorian Davies, was probably one of my favorite parts. She had some of the best lines and it was just really crude humor that was hilarious. Going back to the story, the murderer plot twist was pretty predictable (though I did see that part while working at the theater). It was dumb but the way they figured it out was pretty funny.

It's vulgar which is fine but it's not all that funny unless you find a puppet ejaculating for a really long time funny. Melissa McCarthy chews it up bad but this is a bit of a misstep from her usual Loser to Winner schlick.

To get straight to the point for those who have an interest in American comedy I'm sure this has some appeal but frankly it's got nothing to offer those who don't. It relies heavily on the shock value of puppets dropping the odd expletive and having sex which isn't funny and frankly wears thin after a while. The ""parody"" (and I use that term lightly) of the noir genre is dull and misses the point of a knowing joke just being a boring rehash of cliched lines and the character, again a word to be used very lightly is minimal. As for interactions the protagonists are unbearable and irritating relying often on McCarthy's usual shouting which is unbearable, even the simple fact that it's ready to stream on Netflix isn't enough reason to be worth a watch.

80,gavinp9,Failed attempt at subversion,4,24 August 2018,"'The Happytime Murders' tries to do what 'Team America' did - mixing puppets and adult humour - but ultimately fails. Sure, there's some credibility being that it's directed by Jim Henson's son, but while the puppets all look like 'Muppets' knock-offs, there's no Muppet joy or sense of fun. The plot is that Phil (Baretta - the voice of Pepé from the Muppets) has to work with his ex-cop-partner, Edwards (McCarthy) to solve the murders of the former stars of ""Happytime"" TV show.The cast is good - Bubbles (Rudolph), Phil's the secretary, jerk FBI Agent Campbell (McHale), the Lieutenant (Baker) & Phil's ex-girlfriend Jenny (Banks) - but mostly underutilised. The main issue is the writing - there's some jokes, but just not many funny ones, unfortunately. A lot of the humour resorts to the puppets swearing or doing something gross, which isn't shocking anymore - not after 'Sausage Party'! Melissa McCarthy's OK, but doesn't really have that much to do, the actual murders they're solving are very predictable, so it ends up not working as a cop film or a comedy. There's some message in there about sugar being the worst drug of all, but it's glossed over.

Definitely not for kids.The plot ticks all the boxes for a murder/mystery, so the puppets - who uneasily inhabit the human world - makes it stand out from the crowd.

82,ginocox-206-336968,Pain without truth,2,21 November 2018,"The Happytime Murders (2018) borrows plot elements wholesale from Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Alien Nation, Last Action Hero and Basic Instinct without any effort at refinement, enhancement, redefinition or even any effort to understand how the borrowed elements contribute to the theme.The simplistic plot to a movie targeting preschoolers than - not anything one might term Byzantine, cerebral or convoluted. The mystery is not unraveled by Melissa McCarthy's Detective Connie Edwards character or by her puppet sidekick, but by an amateur sleuth.Melissa McCarthy's character displays few admirable traits. Her character is loyal to those around her, until loyalty becomes inconvenient. She's a brassy and vulgar gainsayer who says exactly what's on her mind, without giving it any thought. Her brand of contemporary feminism seems a compelling argument for old-fashioned misogyny.In lieu of an intelligent plot, the movie offers unintelligible social commentary. The puppets are a painfully obvious allegory for the ultra-left's perception of conservative attitudes toward non-European ethnic subcultures and immigrants. They are tolerated, but not accepted; the object of derision, ridicule, prejudice and harassment; marginalized and consigned to menial and degrading jobs. Yet, the movie depicts the puppets as dull-witted, lazy, lacking ambition, oversexed, heavily armed, prone to alcoholism and substance abuse, morally bankrupt, xenophobic, et cetera.The acting is unimpressive. McCarthy seems to play either herself or a caricature of herself. Most of the other humans in the cast are relegated to minor roles as her straight men. The puppets are state-of-the-art, but lack the range of movement and expression of 3-D animation.Unlike Movie 43 and The Hangover, this movie employs a lot of vulgarity that doesn't seem funny. John Vorhaus defines humor as truth and pain. The situation must be sufficiently relatable to our own experiences, dreams, aspirations, or whatever, to allow the audience to empathize and imagine themselves in the character's situation. THM offers pain without truth. Part of the problem may be the higher threshold of relating to a puppet, but it's also difficult to relate to the puppet in a situation that is difficult to imagine. One can relate to Sesame Street's Bert and Ernie because we've all had roommates and have experienced similar situations. But one cannot easily relate to a puppet finding some sort of erotic fascination in watching a bizarre interaction between an octopus and a cow, or even another puppet's revulsion.In a similar vein, some of the plot challenges the willful suspension of disbelief, because it does not offer a sufficiently credible basis. In Alien Nation, the aliens became intoxicated by drinking curdled milk. A few words of dialogue made this believable within the film's cosmos of reality. THM has a complex plot element involving sugar and organ transplants that isn't made the least bit credible.Despite itself and its many faults, THM offers a few laugh-out-loud moments. These moments are far outnumbered by the groaners.",The Happytime Murders

Dirty jokes come hard and fast, so be warned if you thought that this would make a nice family viewing or something. The first minutes are not that crazy but it turns very ""inappropriate"" soon.Puppets are controlled by real people. One may not understand the inventiveness needed to make a live action movie including puppets - they have used green screens, several people controlling one character, and other film tricks to make it all happen.But before witnessing the making-of clips during the end-credits, most of the audience is probably not gonna be able appreciate the artistry on display.I, for one, thought naively that they use midgets to create motion capture of (some of) the puppet characters. But first and foremost, it makes sense to judge the movie by its content anyway - not by how it was made - and I rather liked what I saw.Basically, it's a 1988's classic ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" pastiche, a film noir which uses the genre cliches for comedic effect. Or ""Toy Story"" pastiche where the original story has been replaced with one out of cop drama.I rather enjoyed the result in any case. The reviewers at Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, on the other hand, seem to despise the movie... but I call it their loss.As mentioned above, the result is very dirty - something one would not expect from a proper film noir, or classical American crime drama from 1940s and 1950s.Also, the authors have decided to stay true to the Muppets' original variety-show approach which means relying much less on quality storytelling and more on satirical sketches about cops or social discrimination (in this case, puppets living among but being treated worse than regular people).But somehow it all works. Even the trivial characters are captivating enough - at least in the context of the scene they appear in - and the general storyline about private eye and cop solving a series of murders is coherent enough to get one through 91 minutes of running-time.I also really liked both the performances of puppets and real actors interacting with them.Melissa McCarthy is one of the stars and offers her usual OK work - I've always considered her more of supporting player than actress able to carry the whole movie, but her growing list of starring roles proves that the producers see something in her that I don't.Still, I would rather recommend the movie for seeing Maya Rudolph and Elizabeth Banks. These sexy and colorful minor characters are nice change for the usual generic roles that they get offered all the time.Also, Muppet veteran Bill Barretta is phenomenally good at voicing the central hero, a disgraced detective turned private eye.The delivery of every line is so enjoyably spot-on, straight outta any cop drama worth its salt, and the puppet seems expressive too.Steven Seagal would probably be proud to see how much can be done with pretty much one facial expression but different body positioning. I hope he will see this movie.So, if you have a taste for raunchy comedies, ""The Happytime Murders"" will give you something entertaining to chew on. At least the quality is higher than in most projects McCarthy has chosen to star in.",The Happytime Murders

Now that I am older, this was more enjoyable than the family-friendly movies like The Muppet Movie and The Muppet Christmas Carol, movies I enjoy but feel kind of childish.That's part of what made this so much fun. I'll get deep into that in a moment.The movie stars the puppet Phil Phillips, who has been fired from police duty simply for being a puppet. However, when puppets of a popular TV show are murdered one by one, only Phil and his human ex-partner can stop the assassin.I saw this with 2 friends and I think I was the only one of the 3 who liked it. I, personally, walked out of the theater laughing my head off.This movie is Rated R and for good reason. There is tons of swearing, and many sexual jokes. One scene has Phil and a female client having rough, crazy sex in his office. When he does, silly sting shoots out all over the room, implying sperm.I died of laughter at that with my hands covering my mouth, and my friend gaped in shock. My other friend was in the bathroom at the time. We told him about it in the car afterwards. He was shocked as well.Like I said, I was the only one who really cared for it. And there's not much critical acclaim. On Roger Ebert's site, it has 2 stars, lower scores on What The Flick?, and other low scores. Richard Roeper, the modern Roger Ebert, didn't give the movie any stars at all.I will admit this movie isn't amazing, but I had a ton of fun, laughed often, and I just went for the ride. I couldn't help but love it.

89,Gresh854,My Eyes Are Bleeding...,1,26 August 2018,"It's funny, I was actually psyched to see this one. Not necessarily because I thought it was going to be a quote on quote ""good"" movie, or I thought it would be an enthralling muppets entry, but because I thought the film's premise would offer a really, amazing time at the theaters, especially with a crowd full of friends, who would be in unison, laughing and howling at the stupidity and absurdity of the movie. That...didn't happen. It more so played out in the fashion of us yawning, fatigued, squirming, mentally troubled, whispering over and over again ""what in the heck"", and maybe, possibly, cheering or applauding at the end-deservedly done because the film had finally ended. The Happytime Murders, put simply, is a disgrace to cinema. 
Interesting enough, this movie despite its hard R-Rating, feels like a middle-schooler wrote it. It plays out like a bland, average, cliché movie filled with a bunch of inhumourous sex, potty, and drug jokes-that I guiltily enough, found amusing during my pre-teen years. But trust me, that stuff only works in Deadpool, but this is no Deadpool, this a Slaughterhouse, Jim Henson's Worst Nightmare, Puppeteer Flick, and it made me want to-more literally than metaphysically-hurl. However, by far, this movie's biggest mistake, is its attempts to be both weighty (serious) and comedic at the same time, and it just doesn't flow, especially all that weighty stuff. All it's messages, morals, and themes are all so so corny-it's the most corny corny can corningly get (It's more corny than an Adam Sandler, family-friendly comedy). The screenplay is to be blamed for this; one of the worst screenplays of the year for sure. In fact, this whole movie is actually the worst movie this year has had to offer so far. I mean (gosh I'm just ranting at this point and I'm losing myself in these waves of words but...ahem...let's just continue and get focused) I at least expected to laugh hard maybe at least a couple of times, but this movie tries way to hard to be witty and on-the-nose peachy, but it just results feeling shoddily cringy and painful. Some scenes which are supposed to be ""raunchy funny"" are actually engraved into my head, in the most negative manner-it's essentially a curse. It sincerely made me question humanity and what we, as humans and filmmakers, have become. And don't give me that: ""Oh, you just don't get it cause you don't get or appreciate dark humor."" Dudes and Duddets, I am a literal sucker for dark humour, it's my all-time favorite genre of comedy. But let me tell you, there is a difference between clever dark humour, and dark humour that is just dark for the sake of being dark because it thinks a hint of edginess is going to get me to go down on my knees and laugh. Jeez, I need to watch The Godfather or even Happy Gilmore (sorry for the bonus Adam Sandler joke) or something thirty times more before I become a pure moviegoer again, cause this garbage makes me feel like I got some anti-cinematic virus lurking and squirming inside of me like a tapeworm. UGH. In spite of all the technicalities of the film-to quickly summarize-the editing, structuring, acting, dialogue, and (a little off topic but it's got to be said) the green-screen effects, are all mediocre to atrocious. The only reason I'm not giving this movie an ""F"" is because I enjoyed Bill Barretta's voice-work, and the puppeteering was off the chains, and I can honestly see and respect the hard-work and commitment that the puppeteers put into this movie. Besides that, if you fall under ALL of these categories: You hate your guts, you're broke as hell, you're divorced for being an abusive alcoholic, your kids hate you cause you were never there for them, you've got no family, you eat nothing but pop-tarts and Cheerios everyday for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, you're currently imprisoned for manslaughter, and you've got nothing else left to lose, then The Happytime Murders just might be the movie for you! Everybody else though is excluded from seeing this. (Verdict: D-)",The Happytime Murders

I guess they didn't need to explain why there was a world of puppets and people. Was there a magical spell, was it alien technology, we never do find out how it came to be. All we know is that puppets are treated as second class citizens. I guess an allegory of what some people experience today.
So the movie kind of started slow for me. The dirty stuff seems to be more gratuitous that need be, and I'm no prude. It just seemed almost depraved lol. I mean, the whole office scene with the silly string was just silly. So on the humour element, the movie his hit or miss.
Now, a lot of people dislike Melissa McCarthy because she plays the same character in these comedies. Personally, I don't mind that at all. It's actually what keeps this movie movie moving, when she enters. That's where all the energy is coming from. If it was just Phil the detective's story, no sidekick like Melissa, it would have been dullsville.
The murder mystery unravels and we eventually come to the interesting twist. I thought it was rather well done. It's a shame that the makers had to really go overboard with the r-rated stuff.

It's not at all clear why the FBI needs to be here, his conflict could've been addressed in some other way, and if you're a police procedural nerd you won't like the FBI seems to be able to suspend local cops.

100,lotekguy-1,"Surprisingly gross, hilarious alternate universe for a new batch of mobile Muppets",7,23 August 2018,"Let's be clear from the get-go. This is a comedy starring Melissa McCarthy and a bunch of Muppets with legs. It's directed by Jim Henson's son, Brian, who has spent many years producing and directing dad's sort of kiddie fare. All that wholesomeness apparently required suppression of adult humor tendencies which finally ruptured, resulting in this VERY RAUNCHY film that many will view as a breath of fresh air. Despite the pedigree and premise, this variation on Who Framed Roger Rabbit is closer to Andrew Dice Clay than to Sesame Street or any of the previous Muppet movies. DON'T BRING THE KIDDIES! Puppets live in L.A. along with humans, but only as second-class residents. A few bits slip in some racial satire with the overall broader comedy. The hero is a down-and-out private detective, salvaging a meager living after being booted from the police force for an unfortunate incident. He's a classic example of film noir dicks, complete with a dumpy office in a seedy area, and a devoted ditzy secretary (Maya Rudolph). When the puppets who starred in an old sitcom start getting bumped off, his efforts to solve the crimes first lead to reluctantly reuniting with his former partner (McCarthy) whose testimony caused his dismissal 20 years earlier. Before long, he becomes suspect Number One for the killing spree. The dialog is clever, with scads of great throwaway lines - some of which I missed because of loud, frequent audience laughter. The mobility of the cloth-clad cast members allowed Henson to deliver some terrifically fresh and funny visuals, with slapstick and grossout gags that will make the unsuspecting blush. Or worse. In my college days (eons ago), I bought a poster of all the Disney characters in a Hieronymus Bosch array of sexual and scatological extremes. It was hilarious. This movie delivers similar irreverence to generations who grew up with wholesome, kid-friendly Muppet antics and lessons, rarely tiptoeing beyond Miss Piggy's horniness for Kermit on the bawdiness scale. This winds up being a treat for those who know what to expect, and particularly for McCarthy's fans. This is actually the best vehicle she's had for a while, which is good news for all comedy buffs. Even if Jim Henson might not approve of his son's choices here, those who enjoy South Park and the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming will feel right at home.

101,RogerBorg,"Lazy, sloppy and cheap",3,30 June 2019,"Is what the writing on the bathroom wall says about Melissa McCarthy. HEY-OHHH!If you laughed at that, maybe you'll get a smirk or two out of The Happytime Murders.Me, I'd sew my eyes shut than watch it again, because it's all of those things, and far, far less.It feels like a double episode of a TV series, and I half suspect that it was written as a (blessedly) abandoned pilot for one. Which is no bad thing in itself, but it's not punchy or polished enough to stand alone as a feature film, feeling both stretched and rushed.I have no problem with the subject matter of crude humour or puppets. Team America; World Police was hilarious, but then it was neither lazy, nor sloppy, not cheap.McCarthy is her usual self, squawking and mugging constantly to no great effect other than to annoy. She keeps getting cast because she keeps getting cast, is the only way to describe her career.The script tries to be ostentatiously edgy (it's not) but then reverts into cringe inducing political correctness. Hollywood just can't get off its bully pulpit.The puppetry itself is workmanlike, but has none of the flashes of genuine character that you'll see in real muppet productions. Jim Henson Productions was right to take legal action to prevent their trademark being used in this abomination's promotional material, because it's not an homage, it's a rip off.You know what I was thinking the whole way through this stumbling, patchy mess?

I think that many people take the movie too serious. It is a puppet movie that deals with criminal movie clicheés, what would that be? For me it was completely clear that I will face a softly anarchistic movie with anarchistic jokes and fun. So it was. I laughed my face of, when one of the puppets ""got off"". Sorry, but who can't laugh at that, goes to basement to let it out! It was surely no serious story and also had some lags, but all-in-all I was well entertained.

It is crude RATED R humor that really has nothing funny about it. Melissa McCarthy was a good fit but deserves a better movie to star in.

106,MikeHunt1075,The Crappytime Movie,1,23 November 2018,"Let's face it, when Melissa Macarthy is in a movie, you should know it's going to be terrible. Honestly, she came on strong in Bridesmaids as a supporting character, but every chance she's had to play the starring role, its flopped. There is no exception found with this movie either.I suspected with the minimal laughs in the trailer that either the best scenes are in the trailer, or it was going to go full on with gross-out humor. The answer... the best bits where in the trailer. What we get is a foul mouthed ex-cop puppet and a foul mouthed woman cop who think screaming obsenity is somehow funny if you say it louder each time.There is minimal laughs, and wasted potential. When done right, puppets on acid so to speak can really work well and be hilarious, just see Wonder Showzen (2005) for proof of that. When you discover the team behind this is Jim Hensons (The Muppets) son then you would think an R rated puppet master would be fantastic.... unfortunately the budget mustve been blown on Melissa Macarthys catering instead of having someone with comedic talent ad some decent comedy into the script.I dunno who was smoking what to greenlight this film, or what kind of dare was made after showing this to a test audience that no way would have been laughing throughout the film, but it's the absolute final nail in the coffin for me and seeing any future movies starring Macarthy, and I really hope The Henson Company learns to stick with making Muppets and Star Wars puppets but not try to ever venture into an R rated territory ever again. There is minimal laughs, a predictable plot, stupid motives, and nothing memorable after seeing the trailer.... which I smirked at, but failed to find it funny during the film because it's already been seen, and not really funny the second time around.Don't kick yourself for skipping this one... it's really a waste of potential with an overrated star and if they just cut out the cuss words and few rude bits, its a boring kids movie.",The Happytime Murders

No one cares if a puppet gets ripped off or loses its stuffing. Enter Melissa McCarthy's in her normal foul-mouthed role. She swears in direct proportion to how un-funny her role is; as if doing that will make up for a script's lack of comedy. In this she doesn't need to swear too much but she does anyway. When ex-stars of a puppet show start getting un-stitched she teams up with a puppet private investigator to solve the murders.It gets very weird. This is what happens when sexually repressed puppeteers have to do doe-rey-mee rhymes for fifty years. When they let go: they really let go. Including bad language, simulated sex, felt muffs, P.I. shooting silly string; but not with his gun and cow-milking with extreme prejudice. I think they wanted to embarrass the audience.I did laugh, I spluttered, I covered my eyes and my mouth kept making w shapes.

114,trevorwomble,An interesting idea ruined by a lazy script,5,10 September 2018,"Oh dear, I was so looking forward to this adult version of a muppets style film. An ex-cop puppet turned private eye is shouldered with his old partner to investigate a series of puppet killings. Should have and could have been a decent, funny film but alas too many things don't click here and the whole thing seems laboured.Firstly, the script is atrocious. When will film makers get it in their dumb heads that inserting swearing is not a substitute for witty dialogue? That kind of laziness has ruined many a good idea. Eddie Murphy for example destroyed a promising career by doing too many films that ran out of ideas and therefore substituted profanities for wit and comedy (remember garbage like Harlem Nights and Another 48 Hours?). This film seems to have taken that route too and it has destroyed a potentially promising idea.Melissa McCarthy's career can probably survive a misfire like this film. She does her best with weak material but even at only 96 minutes the film feels too long. There are a handful of genuine laughs in the film (even if they are X rated humour) but just not enough of them. However this is hardly the highpoint of her career and unless she wants to avoid her career slipping into the toilet like Eddie Murphy's did she needs to be more careful in future.As for Brian Henson, this is the same director who brought us the brilliant Muppet Christmas Carol back in 1992. I do understand him trying to do something different and more adult but honestly, did he not read the script before he started filming? The dialogue is atrocious at times and there are too many unfunny jokes. The camerawork and effects are all fine but then again those aren't the problems with this film, the problems lie in the abysmal writing and unfunny performances.

Also one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. I didn't know it was possible in this day and age to make a movie worse than Howard The Duck, but to my utter dismay something worse than Howard The Duck was made, The Happytime Murders. I am so sick of people taking kids characters or things associated with kids and making them more ''adult'' and ''mature''. There is nothing mature about this! The Muppet Show still holds up really well to this day and is much better than this cinematic abomination, so why make it so adult to the point where it's just uncomfortable to watch? And Hollywood, for God's sake, stop casting Melissa McCarthy as a main character in your horrible films. She is one of the worst actors and comedians in the world and is only ever slightly humorous when she has a supporting role. She is not capable of being a main character, so just stop. We're tired of getting an incredibly awful Melissa McCarthy movie every single year. The only good movie Melissa McCarthy has been in, in the past 5 years, is Spy, so stop. The Happytime Murders is filled to the brim with low brow adult jokes that any 12 year old could come up with on the spot. The writing is god awful. If you wanted to make a funny Muppets movie that adults could enjoy then actually make a funny Muppets movie that adults can enjoy, because, fun fact, a lot of adults actually enjoy and love The Muppets, and to see something try to parody it in this way just feels like they were trying to bastardise the name of The Muppets. This movie is not funny whether or not you watch it ironically, it is painful to watch. Dumb and low brow humour, horrid script, bad characters, bad acting and the only thing I can say about this movie is that it isn't as bad as Food Fight. When your movie is that bad that the only thing that can be said about it is ''not as bad as Food Fight'' that is when you know you have screwed up. Screw this movie.",The Happytime Murders

118,Field78,Muppetz with Attitude,7,29 August 2018,"Everyone who has ever watched Ernie & Bert or a Muppets Show episode will probably have let his or her imagination run wild, and make the puppets do all kinds of sick, R-rated stuff in their mind. Well, it turns out that the good people at Jim Henson Shop also have a bit of a dirty mind as well, and they have been collecting all their twisted ideas for a few decades so that they could pour it into one big, extra long, deliciously raunchy and very violent Sesame Street episode.In a world where humans are boss and puppets are second-rate citizens, a series of murders forces two investigators (one of each species) to begrudgingly cooperate in order to solve the case. This is all done in a film noir style, complete with a disillusioned detective with a traumatized past, a seedy office and a gruffy voice-over, spliced with a buddy comedy where the two reluctant partners initially cannot stand each other, but adversity finally makes them connect. Sounds a lot like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but due to the modern setting, the makers get to put in a lot of contemporary jokes and social commentary. The depraved state of the underbelly of our current society and the metaphore for black vs white is hard to miss, but they manage to get enough gags out of that to keep it light (puppets crave sugar instead of drugs, and there are slurs against puppets that apparently vary in polictical incorrectness). The relationship between man and puppet, as well as a traumatized past even gives the movie something of a heart.But let's face it: we watch this movie primarily for its balls, and it is balls out all the way through. Every profane situation that you can imagine involving a puppet is in this movie, and you will not find many current movies with such a high content of jokes involving genitals and physical love. It is as if you can almost feel the liberation of the puppeteers to finally do some of the R-rated stuff that was always in the back of their mind. This only works if you have good actors who can feel comfortable with that racy material (as well as believably interact with puppets), so enter Melissa McCarthy, who again shows her hilarious talent for verbal vulgarity, creative observations (""that's why you don't swim in your own gene pool"") and physical action, something traditionally associated with male comedians. McCarthy usually can't do wrong in my book when she gives the other cast enough room, so you have to appreciate her raunchy and self-deprecating humor to make it through the end here. A special mention for Maya Rudolph, who also shows a feeling for less subtle humor previously unseen before, especially when she describes a process called 'pilavving'. There are actually two things that keep this movie from getting 8 or 9 stars from me, and that is the fact that it is way too short (a meager 84 minutes including credits), and the plot is quite predictable. I felt that the movie was picking up momentum for a grande finale that would put every previous dirty joke and profane situation in the shadow. But unfortunately, the screenwriters didn't go the extra mile in ending it on a solid, spectacular and surprising note. They put homages to the film noir genre throughout the movie, but they apparently respect the rules too much, and end it in a genre-conventional way without a clever spin that would have been welcome. As a genre spoof done with animated techniques, Team America: World Police did a better job at the end.It stands to reason that this movie in all its crude glory will not be for everyone. I have already read mixed reviews here of entire audiences either walking out or cracking up and falling off seats. Fortunately, I was in one of the latter, and it is good to see that there is still love for movies so unapologetically and brazenly tasteless. It is really too bad that the appreciation for offensive jokes has diminished in a politically correct age where we desperately try to avoid displeasing anyone. Contrary to what people think, bad jokes are not a product of lazy writing, they require creativity and thought to prevent from becoming repetitive (or you get something like Sausage Party where they merely tried to break the record for curse words in an animated movie). I feel that this movie pulled it off for about 70 minutes. Too bad about those final conventional 15 minutes, but the excess of sex jokes makes up for a lot.",The Happytime Murders

125,moorek,Ignore the reviews and watch it,6,18 April 2019,"I thought this movie was going to be great when I first heard of it. Then I heard all the negative reviews so I never saw it. Tonight it was on Netflix so I thought I'd watch it. I found much of it very entertaining.It is no worse than any other B grade private detective, who-done-it type movie or TV show. But with the puppets, it puts a different spin on that. The world of humans and puppets wasn't explored enough but what we saw was good. The discriminatory aspect of humans against puppets might have been pushed too much but it was still not too far.The main puppet character felt like a real character at the end of the movie. In some ways more so than the Melissa McCarthy character.I didn't find the fairly constant swearing paid off. It was one thing to have puppets swear as we don't expect that. But the novelty wears off fast.The one that was odd was that this was clearly a movie for adults with lots of very overt sexual scenes. Yet some of the humour seemed infantile. It's like someone wrote a kid's movie mimicking an old detective movie and then someone else came along and put in very sexual elements. A scene between McCarthy and an FBI agent becomes a silly, almost slap type fight. Or a point about not having a banana. Or the milkshake on the car. Or a puppet with little eyes peering over a counter, only to have him stand up and those are eyes on antennae and he has regular eyes too.

And all I wanted was to either laugh or be engaged by the plot, two things I think where fair to expect from a comedy/noir movie. But boy did this movie ever suck.The movie takes place in a world where Muppets and people live together, and doesn't even have the decency to fully develop the world's logic at the most basic level. Why would a puppet not be allowed to work as s cop? And then be given free reign around crime scenes? And then be made a consultant? How would a human be able to live with a puppets kidney/liver implanted in it? And on and on... So lazy.Laziness was a recurring issue with the movie. The humor: every joke and gag was surface level, base, and totally on the nose obvious. The low point in the movie, the sex scene, came a little more than an hour into the film.

128,Vivkon,Unleashed Political Incorrectness,8,28 August 2018,"A new era of resistance to political correctness provokes a huge level of marginalized and genital humor. One example is The Happytime Murders. A ton of plebeian and profane jokes fits in the coexisting universe of humans and puppets. This movie brings out the absurdity of extending of sexual rights to puppets, where toys are not only sexual objects, but also workers. Some puppets are victims of sexual harassment and murdering, and they need to be protected. An officer Phil Philips (Bill Barretta) and LAPD detective Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy) intent on capturing the criminals. During their law enforcement duties viewers can observe a bunch of jokes. One of them is much too ""colorful"". That it is so close leans on the verge of racial and LGBTQ prejudices. For example, ""Blue lives matter""s' digs in this movie directly alluding to the puppets' blue color. Especially, if a blue color of puppets can be considered as one of race in that artificial world of mutual life between puppets and people. Movie is also full of ""white trash"" which excessively appear on the air, because ""cushion issues"" of puppets are at permanent risk according to the plot. Some scene of blue hair genitals refers to wearing a blue feather - indicator of an affiliation with Clan Blue Feather. And, sure, one of puppet's character is a gay. Technically, besides ""colorful"" laughs, authors make sex as a driver of this movie. Almost every scene is full of sexual connotations. Even that blue hair genitals force to flash back to the well-remembered scene of Sharon Stone from Basic Instinct. Sexual exploitation and unethical sexual behavior appear everywhere, from boss-employee relationships to night club life. Super sexual potential of puppets creates a hysterical laugh. Mixing horror and humor in the scenes of toys-human intercourses and BDSM practices blow up your mind absolutely. Sometimes humans are lover of puppets. From time to time, puppets are sex workers and it brakes up your world picture and idea of what is allowed. In an awkward scene of zoophile at Puppet Pleasure Land shows you how unlimited human and puppet libidos are. The bottom line is if you let yourself be dirty minded, this movie is for you. Anyway for most people, who are affectionate of toys and Muppet show, the Happytime Murders will come off as offensive and emotionally heartless. Nevertheless, flashing humor of the movie exposes how far human fantasy can bring this World: a cushion liver as a transplant tissue, misleading and misconduct of alternative beings' crimes, puppets celebrities and etc. An actor playing with puppets definitely makes credit for them and music production will keep your focus on the story line. Additionally, scripts and visual effect will infect you with an abnormal dose of political incorrectness.",The Happytime Murders
129,JTurner82,Uneven mix of raunchiness and mystery. Great puppetry though.,6,25 August 2018,"""Sesame Street"" this ain't. Neither, unfortunately, is it AVENUE Q. THE HAPPYTIME MURDERS, a pet project of Brian Henson, the son of the famous Jim Henson, is an ambitious and technically amazing but uneven and at times, too distractingly vulgar, production which aims to be primarily for adults. Although capably directed and packed with a likable cast of stars and an interesting if familiar mystery plot, the end result is a mixed bag more than anything else. Critics were especially harsh on this film, declaring it to be an unfunny mess and one of the worst films of the year. My opinion: it's nowhere near that. But it's not exactly a great movie either. It's somewhere inbetween.The best part of the film is the puppetry. Although the characters in question are a far cry from the likes of Big Bird or Kermit the Frog -- they swear constantly, snort drugs (read: rock candy with a Twizzler!), have sex, and in one disgustingly overlong scene ejaculate silly string over the room(!). But the puppeteers and the technical wizardry behind making these puppet characters as convincing and believable as they do cannot be faulted. This is top notch work. Particularly impressive are some wide shots where we see the puppets in full size walking across the street without having to look at them from the waist up. (As a bonus, there's an end credit sequence in which we see outtakes -- or rather, footage of how this stuff works.) The lead character, a disgraced police officer named Phil Phillips, puppeteered by Bill Barretta, goes through a relatable character arc to keep one invested in his plight.The other assets are live actresses Melissa McCarty and Maya Rudolph. McCarty shares the top-billing as Phillips' ex-partner, Connie Edwards, and while your opinions about the actress may vary, she actually gives a great performance in this film. She treats the puppets as equals and is a lot of fun to watch. Ruldoph gives a more tender turn as Phillips' secretary, oddly named Bubbles. Although she doesn't have many scenes, she brings a lot of much needed heart to the picture.The idea behind the picture is sound: a world where puppets are treated as second-class citizens (think WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT but with puppets instead of cartoons and you get the idea), and a murder mystery which involves puppets getting bumped off by a mysterious assassin. These murders, oddly enough, are actually among the most visually humorous moments in the film! Rather than spraying blood, we see stuffing pop out of these puppets as they are gunned down, decapitated, or mutilated -- you name it! It's oddly funny in a twisted way. And the plotline, although not especially original or groundbreaking, at least builds well to its climax, even if the final showoff is disappointingly short.The primary problem with THE HAPPYTIME MURDERS is that it spends much of its 90 minute running time indulging in a lot of tastelessly vulgar stuff. Although meant to provide humor, sights of seeing these characters doing the things mentioned earlier actually proves to be more off-putting than funny. An overlong sex scene involving Philips and another puppet, femme fatale Sandra, which culminates with a gross, extensive silly string gag, in particular, left me sick to my stomach and did take me out of the picture. The wonderful Broadway musical AVENUE Q had a similar scene that was nowhere near this disgusting and arguably funnier.Worse still, there's no major purpose to a lot of this shock value stuff. It feels as though Henson was trying to push as much comfort zone as possible, but I feel that bad taste for bad taste's sake does not a great movie make. I can't help but wonder if maybe the film would be better off toning down a lot of this over-the-top raunchiness, as it would at least make its storyline more tighter plotted. There are also some implied ideas that puppets are treated as second class citizens, but the script doesn't delve into them as deeply as it could have.There are flashes of brilliance in THE HAPPYTIME MURDERS, and it isn't an altogether failure, but the inconsistent shift in tone and overemphasis on the shock value cause the picture to be a mixed bag. It is worth watching for the amazing puppetry and McCarthy and Ruldolph's performances, but as the show is quite profane and extreme, it's definitely not for kids.",The Happytime Murders

But If you look at it as a raunchy adult movie with a lot of adult humor, you'll get a laugh out of this. Melissa McCarthy is an absolute HOOT!! The lady has a license for funny! All the actors were great in this movie.. as it was intended for the adult humor. The hardest part about watching this is thinking it's based on our own love for the innocence of the Muppets, and for that the irreverence of taking a sweet and innocent childhood memory and putting it in this situation is a big disappointing. If you hated the Muppets, you'll love this movie. If you loved the Muppets, you might hate this movie. For those who walk out of the theater the second the credits start... DON'T!! If you want to know how they made the movie.. stay until the end! If you want to see the actors and production people having fun during the making, stick around.",The Happytime Murders
133,johnplocar,It's unfortunate how forgettable it is. It's not terrible. Has potential and some funny moments. But should have been much better.,6,23 November 2018,"Usually after I watch a movie, I try to give myself some time in order to process everything, evaluate and even re-evaluate the film. Just an attempt to let everything really sink in before I give my thoughts on it. I think that may have been a mistake this time around to have given myself so much time between now and when I watched the film, which was just last night, because I've already forgotten a lot about ""The Happytime Murders"". This movie is just that forgettable, that should not be a defining characteristic about a movie involving muppets being brutally murdered and have outlandish sex scenes. That just should not be the case, at all. I should remember everything about this movie, even if it was a bad movie I should not be saying that the R rated puppet comedy has already fleeted from my brain less than twenty-four hours later.""The Happytime Murders"" takes place in a world where puppets are alive and they coexist with humans; after private investigator Phil Phillips receives a case from a mysterious puppet woman, he happens upon a string of murders that he believes are linked by the victims being involved in a television show from the 90s (reminiscent of Sesame Street) called the Happytime Gang. But in order to find the killer, Phil must team up with his old human partner (Melissa McCarthy) and together they come across quirky puppets as well as some mayhem.From the synopsis alone, I feel like I should be describing this film as anything other than simply mediocre. Unfortunately that is exactly what ""The Happytime Murders"" is, mediocre. It is more or less like any other modern comedy that you can find Melissa McCarthy or Will Ferrell doing nowadays; little story and heavy amounts of adlibbing. To be fair, it's not the worst offender of having the 'line-o-rama' syndrome, but I don't want lame babbling mouthed idiots that go on forever in my supposed 'over-the-top' puppet screwball flick. I wanted way more of what the trailer promised quite honestly. I wanted all the gruesome puppet murders, the insane puppet sex scenes, cracked out of their mind puppets offering sexual favors...and we get a little bit of that. Here and there, but no more than what can be found in the previews for this movie which is extremely disappointing because it is mostly just the characters going back and forth with adlibbed lines. And I can be fine with adlibbing and improv in film, when it is does right and edited properly. Robin Williams as Genie in ""Aladdin"" is a good example of how that can work well. The original 1984 ""Ghostbusters"" with basically its whole main cast that improvised a good amount of their lines. But with those movies the characters felt consistent, the actors got back on track with the script speedily, and the editor made sure to keep the excess fat from their improv out of the final cut. Comedies don't do that much anymore, they have their leads go back and forth while practically throwing out the script and the editor basically keeps every take in the scene when it should be severely trimmed down. ""Happytime Murders"" does the same thing, but at least I can say that it keeps its run time under two hours, unlike other offenders that needlessly push that two hour mark. Plus the adlibbed segments don't detract from the plot too drastically, but enough to hurt the project as a whole.Aside from the adlibbing, the film feels as though it is played so safe. If you took out the puppets and a few specific moments of violence, this movie is like any other raunchy comedy. That to me is hugely disappointing about this movie. It should have been more ambitious in how ridiculous and over-the-top it could have been. For most of the run time I was constantly thinking about how much better Peter Jackson's ""Meet the Feebles"" was in comparison to ""The Happytime Murders"", because at the very least I can say that Jackson went all out and pulled no punches with his film. That film wasn't afraid to go places and it got dark, which supplied a substantial amount of its comedy. While with ""Happytime Murders"" I went for some seriously long gaps without laughing. I believe I literally went for fifteen to twenty minutes without uttering so much as a light chuckle. That should never be the case for watching a comedy. I never sat there mad or anything like that, and I certainly have seen plenty worse comedies from this year, but I was extremely bored through a lot of it.I will say that I did appreciate that this movie took inspiration from old noir thrillers such as in its narration, the story being a murder mystery that involves a private investigator, and there's even a femme fatale. The puppeteering also has some top notch work done here; I truly enjoyed how these puppets were brought to life and how they function in this unique world of puppet/people cohabitants. The main puppet, Phil Phillips, was a good lead and actually carried me most of the way through. The violence and absurdity of the world, what little there is, is funny. When a puppet gets his head blown off and there's cotton flying everywhere, it is very humorous. Or when something like a cow puppet is filming a porno with an octopus puppet, again, it got a laugh out of me. But those moments are so rare that at no point did I ever feel like I was watching the dark comedy that this was meant to be. Also, for a film that takes such heavy inspirations from noir crime mysteries, it looks so bland. The cinematography just looks so clean and basic, when a noir is dark and full of atmosphere. Even the concept art for this movie looks much closer to a noir tale than what the final product turned out to be. The story was also very predictable, which I could have forgiven if the movie was funnier, but I only laughed a handful of times.While no one does a particularly bad job in their roles, in terms of the actors, I really do wish that this starred dramatic actors rather than comedians. I understand that this is a comedy, therefore, yes it does make sense to cast comedians. However, if this film had starred more dramatic actors I feel that could have fed into the comedy way more because I personally find it funnier when the characters are taking their world seriously. For example, in ""Airplane"", the majority of that cast was acting in a way that made sure their characters were grounded in that absurd reality. They took everything in their world seriously, making the goofy things that happen all the funnier. No one here acts like this is their world. Everyone comes across as a comedian trying to be zany in front of the camera because 'comedy'. But that's not funny to me. There can be times where that works fine, but here it just comes across as simply trying too hard. Plus, if there were more dramatic actors in the movie that would largely eliminate the adlibbing problem.Overall, I thought this movie is probably okay to turn on in the background or if you're bored and it pops up on Netflix. I say that because there are some good things about the movie, things that I do appreciate such as the puppeteering and I would hate if that were to go unnoticed. But it really isn't all that funny. It's not entirely groan inducing, but it should have been a lot better. Or at the very least a lot more memorable. I could have accepted this movie more so if it was a dumpster fire because then I would remember it. As it is, I'm going to forget that I even saw this in the next couple days. However, if I were you, I would just seek out ""Meet the Feebles"" because I promise that won't be boring for anyone.",The Happytime Murders
134,villard,Muppets Gone Wild,1,20 January 2019,"The film is nothing more than a disgusting, vulgar attempt at adult humor with Muppets. This Roger Rabbit wannabe flops miserably on all counts.There is absolutely nothing funny about this movie unless you find some scrap of humor in offensive and deplorably graphic puppet antics.I'm no prude. I thoroughly enjoyed Comedy Central's obnoxious Crank Yankers risqué puppet skits, as well as Team America's.But when a string of lewd scenes and potty-mouth dialogue have no redeemable satire or parody value, it's just crude and gratuitous.God help any parent who rented this travesty for their kids thinking it was just another cute family movie with the misleading title. ""Happytime.""Shame, shame, shame on the Disney folks for thinking that they had to pander to an adult audience for this tasteless Muppet misadventure.Muppets creator Jim Henson must be turning in his grave.",The Happytime Murders
135,rustonreviews,Absolute fluff.,4,31 August 2018,"I was never a fan of The Muppets growing up. Jim Henson's iconic creations originated in the 1950's and continued to thrive for decades, starring in eight feature films and various spin off productions. Despite making a surprise resurgence in 2011 with the Jason Segal fronted reboot, Henson's most beloved creations have since disappeared into obscurity once again, with Kermit the Frog soldiering on through internet meme culture. Cut to 2018, and Brian Henson unleashes The Happytime Murders; a Muppet-esque crime-comedy film geared solely towards adults that has endured through development hell since it's announcement in 2008. Phil Philips (Barretta), a disgruntled LAPD detective turned private investigator, teams up with his old partner Detective Connie Edwards (McCarthy) as consultant when the puppet cast of The Happytime Gang, a popular children's TV show from the 90's, are murdered one by one. There's something incredibly amusing about the concept of taking something typically geared towards younger viewers and twisting it in such a way so that it appeals to an adult audience. In the case of The Happytime Murders, the novelty of puppets functioning in an adult world indulging in drink, drugs and sex wears off pretty quickly, and all of its shock factor is, unfortunately, diminished by the end of the first act. Barretta's grizzled P.I Philips is a likeable enough lead, and although I've never considered McCarthy to be much of a comedic screen presence, she is serviceable enough despite continuing the same shtick that embodies the typical McCarthy performance we've all come to expect from her. Berger's script, running at a brisk 90 minutes, does contain some clever, chuckle-worthy one liners and some amusing visual gags, but much of the humour feels cheap and lazy and the moments that work are too few and far between. One of the films biggest failing factors is that it often plays itself a little too seriously for its own good, leading to a conflicting tonal mess. The filmmakers know the film is trashy, crude fun, and yet the inclusion of a serious backstory betrays this notion. The Happytime Murders is a film destined to gain a cult following in the years to come, but the frustrating thing about the film is that so much of it falls flat, just falling short of warranting a so-bad-it's-good grade. As the credits rolled during an admittedly fun credits sequence including behind the scenes glimpses, two words came to mind that sum the film up entirely: absolute fluff.",The Happytime Murders

142,shadow_blade-89459,Simple Miss,5,30 August 2018,"""The Happytime Murders (2018) is a professionally produced comedic crime drama about Phil Phillips, a Private Investigator puppet voiced by Bill Barretta, as he unwillingly teams up with his old partner, Detective Connie Edwards played by Melissa McCarthy, to solve a rash of puppet murders from a popular 90s kids show. This film can be equated to a less successful mash up of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and ""Sausage Party"" that I found more vulgar than funny. However, I did enjoy the film, but I would have never gone to a theater to see this film had I known exactly how over-the-top the execution would be. There are some bright spots within the storyline, though they may be missed due to the graphic attempts at comedy. Two points that truly stick out are the racial like tension between humans and puppets and the concept of jumping to conclusions. Focusing on the racial like tension, this film hits a mark for today's society. Just because a person, or puppet in this case, looks different or acts different doesn't make them any less than yourself. Writers Todd Berger and Dee Austin Robertson did an amicable job incorporating a real-life message into a comedy built on shock. It is truly difficult to gauge the acting of a puppet, but their human counterparts were spot on. All the main characters seemed as if they belonged in that variation of life. I commend them for a job well done in a film that missed its mark. I believe the best way to improve this film would have been to tone down the vulgarity. What is funny by the likes of ""Sausage Party"" doesn't translate as well in a more realistic realm. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this film for a theater viewing, especially with kids. I would wait for it to become available to rent at home where if you can't get into the storyline, you can turn it off and only be out a couple dollars.",The Happytime Murders

146,Scarefish,The Crappytime Murders,2,26 August 2018,"The Happytime Murders is a premise so basic, yet so full of potential, that it is impossible to watch the film without constantly being disappointed regardless of how low your expectations are. An adult comedy with Hensen puppets should not be more childish than Sesame Street, and yet here I am typing out this review.Melissa McCarthy is as unfunny as ever, delivering some supposed comedy that makes Ghostbusters (2016) and Mike & Molly seem like Monty Python in comparison. A lot of the worst tropes from a typical McCarthy comedy are here in full force. McCarthy cannot let a joke hang, and instead repeats jokes over and over with a mind-numbing effect, and simply never stops talking. There's no nuance or finesse to anything and it descends to just noise once the initial charm is completely obliterated on a regular basis. There's a scene where the joke is that McCarthy's character is high and she steals a line word for word from her partner and repeats it an additional two times after. It's like a very similar joke used in Zoolander, however the difference is that Zoolander repeated the line once and it had significant impact as the punchline came longer after the set-up, and that joke was an accident that turned out a funnier joke than this copy-paste joke formulated by a bunch of old men in suits and ties. There is also a rather cringeworthy female empowerment scene in which McCarthy teaches a vulgar dog puppet to speak more politically correct which is held on too long to be considered a dumb joke rather than preachy third-wave feminism.The design behind the puppets are thoroughly bland and unimaginative, feeling like nothing more than a mockbuster rather than a heartful spinoff, which is simply unacceptable from the actual Hensen brand. This film basically feels like a rushed piece of low-energy trash marketed as a cartoon spinoff adult comedy film that is so obviously trying to catch Sausage Party on the rebound. Most characters look like they were whipped together in literally ten seconds each using some sort of DeviantArt dress-up game, those ten seconds being used to mash a ""Randomize All"" button until something vaguely marketable appears. A lot of the characters simply look horrendous, and it's only amplified once they are shown in motion.The jokes are very hit-or-miss, and unfortunately they miss a vast majority of the time. If you've watched any Family Guy from the past 8 years, you'll probably be familiar with this style of so-called comedic delivery used in lieu of wit or charm or any other meaningful appeal that stands even the shortest test of time. Even a goldfish with Alzheimer's would demand more substance behind these jokes.This film reminds me of Bee Movie in a way, except in this instance the audience is Jerry Seinfeld expecting this to be the funniest idea in the history of comedy only to end up with the film equivalent of manure. This film could have worked, but unfortunately every joke and gag seems funnier on paper than it does as presented in the film, and that is largely due to the delivery and direction throughout. A lot of the gags are simple jokes that are so obvious that they demand nothing less than the most ridiculous over-the-top execution possible, and instead they are delivered with about as much energy as Seth Rogen on the 20th of April. This film doesn't only feel like it was written by a bunch of stoned teenagers; it feels like it was also filmed, directed, and acted by them too, and what results is a sluggish, barely-watchable piece of hot garbage that only out-of-touch Hollywood executives could love.I feel the setup in this film was rather misguided, as I figured the film would attempt at least a minimally acceptable amount to do some world-building between this world of heated action between humans and puppets. The human characters feel incredibly out of place, and not in an intentional comedic sort of way, but rather in a lazy way where the writers didn't want to bother thinking that hard about a dumb movie about puppets doing naughty things. I thought Phil Phillips, the puppet, would be the respected cop and McCarthy would be the disgraced cop who has to go full Blade Runner to regain her humanity. Instead we get a disgraced puppet cop who constantly gets bullied by an obnoxious and equally pathetic human cop.Most parts of this film are entirely predictable, and are not executed in a satisfying way. For a comedy, predictability can actually be an asset as it allows you to set up jokes and pay them off or subvert them, but the film never subverts expectations and it has a crippling deficiency when it comes to giving their delivery some kick. The film has as much flair as a supermassive black hole. There is a sheer lack of effort from just about everyone behind this film, and it doesn't ever have the huge kick or unrivaled insanity that it truly needed to deliver on what it was promising with its premise.Every decision behind the making of this film feels hollow and transparent from people who don't actually watch enough films to realize how they have doomed their film from the start by casting such motley crew of hacks who managed success despite sheer lack of talent. I highly doubt anyone with an IQ above their age said, ""Hey, let's get Molly from Mike & Molly! She's so funny in that show!"" The simple matter is that it was a bunch of businessmen crunching numbers rather than trying to produce a product that aimed to earn money rather than scam a bunch of whales out of what little money they have to spare in this hilariously depressing economy.",The Happytime Murders

It's far from being a good film, but I didn't think it was as bad as it was hyped up to be.If you take The Happytime Murders and remove the puppets it would just be a run of the mill late night comedy. I doubt we'd even be talking about it because it's kind of dull, and tame. Adding puppets into this tired story didn't really even make it better. I mean there is no bite to this. It feels like they decided to make a muppets movie but with some lewd jokes, and not actually that many. In fact, the lewdest stuff all had to do with bodily fluids, which is already a cliche of late night comedy. I thought that with Henson behind this they would have taken the time to satirize the muppets, and sesame street, all the things that were their bread and butter but seem to have fallen through the cracks in the new generation of TV and movies. Yet, I think that already exists with Meet The Feebles. They love making Muppet movies where they go on the road, why not make a Road Trip style comedy where four Puppets go on a drug-fueled sex crazed road trip. I mean it would have been better than this.So, in the end, The Happytime Murders are not as bad as I thought but the remain tame and far from good.

I feel, also, that Brian Henson is a good director of this type of materiel. It's fine to see filmmakers pursue something ""outside the box"", so to speak. I just didn't find it particularly funny. It's... amusing, at most. I liked Maya Rudolph's character, she was very likable. I like seeing Joel McHale in theatrical films, as well. Once again, Melissa McCarthy didn't get on my nerves, which is good. When you see the music video at the end, and see how much work people had to do, to make this movie, you see that as a film, it's impressive. But as a comedy, it's really only mediocre.",The Happytime Murders

There is literally no scenario where puppets would be alive at all and this movie was terrible. I only had it on to literally charge my phone and give it a chance but now I regret that entirely. Wasted time of my life that I will never get back. I will never understand how this movie even made it in theaters. The acting in this movie was crappy as well.

165,SouthernViews,When Puppets Get Nasty,7,22 December 2020,"If you enjoyed Avenue Q, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and Team America World Police, you would probably love this movie. I've had this film on my Watchlist for months but always skipped it due to the negative critical reviews. After watching the movie, I can honestly say most critics need to lighten up.
In this movie, puppets are living beings and co-exist with humans. It all happens in a very realistic R-rated world. There were so many laugh out loud moments in this movie. It's a breezy, fun, detective thriller that happens to include puppets and raunch. Many of the scenes are rather shocking, but I applaud the creators for going all-in with the story.
The human cast, lead by Melissa McCarthy, is great. Puppeteering is top-notch, as is the voice work. Stay for the credits, where they show how they created many key scenes.
I would've rated the movie higher, except that there are some inconsistencies in the world-building. For example, the puppets are both a) nothing but stuffing, and b) have organs and can sprain their ankles? I think the writers should have spent a bit more time trying to nail this world down. Otherwise, kick back and enjoy the insane low-ball humor and who-dunnit mystery. I was pleasantly surprised and definitely recommend the movie, if you like this type of humor. Oh, and won't be offended by a Henson showing dirty puppet acts.",The Happytime Murders
166,dungeonstudio,A Cult Classic! Improves With Age!,8,23 March 2021,"Being a fan of the eclectic to the eccentric in cinema, I was eager to see 'how far' this movie would go when it was released. For those who know 'Let My Puppets Come', this maybe a slightly tamer version still. I think what got me on first viewing is I didn't know what exactly I'd be hit with. The dialog is dry and quick, and the plot and backstory is as confusing as Chinatown. But I couldn't help feeling there was more work put into this movie than I was prepared to appreciate. On getting the DVD and watching it a few times now, it's truly a well mapped out and performed gem! To 'get into its groove' I don't think one can on first viewing. It takes itself seriously, but also has some great wit and timing. The puppetry, acting, and CGI effects are WELL beyond The Dark Crystal and the like. Some truly impressive shots and set ups that baffled me on second and third viewing. And there's 'warmth' to it all. Melissa McCarthy and Ryan Tran playing Phil have some great touching moments as they repair their damaged partnership. And amazingly, a lot of the dialog was improvised - numerous times! So editing must've been a nightmare - but it works! So as crude and juvenile this movie may seem at first, it truly deserves a good watch and listen to, as it's really thought out and well played by everyone involved! Kudos to Brian Henson for going 'out there' with it all. Certainly not for kids! But when those kids grow up, this is a movie they can still appreciate in the future!",The Happytime Murders

Can they make a sequel full of poop, weed, vomit gross jokes ? It will still be more entertaining than this joke of a film ! Happytime Murders has the one joke, and it's repeated throughout the 80 minute movie as much as possible. Whenever Henson and screenwriter Todd Berger are backed into a corner with no possibility for imagination when it comes to dreaming up a killer punchline, they have one of the puppet characters curse or say something outrageous, primarily about sex. That's about a daring as the film gets, with Henson going the simple route of shock value to inspire a giddy reaction, but others have beaten him to the punch when it comes to puppets behaving badly (Peter Jackson's Meet the Feebles), requiring something a little more than naughty words being spoken by foam creations to leave a lasting mark on the audience. However, for Henson and Berger, this is far as they go with this film, which is nothing more than a series of dull scenes peppered with vulgarity, missing satiric and slapstick opportunities with unsettling regularity.

175,MacArthur_Parker,No shame here.,10,24 August 2018,"Unlike my recent guilty pleasure, Teen Titans GO!, I am undeterred in admitting that I loved The Happytime Murders, because it directly caters to my love of puppets and depraved sense of humor. Also, if a movie puts Melissa McCarthy at the forefront, that is also an easy selling point. This is probably my favorite of her non-Paul Feig-helmed projects. And an adult-oriented puppet movie directed by Brian Henson, son of the Puppet King himself?Depicting a world where humans and puppets coexist, but puppets are regarded as second-class citizens (race relations, much?), there once was a puppet cop, Phil Philips (Bill Barretta), whose mistake on a hostage situation a decade earlier ended his career, leaving him to become a grizzled private investigator. The select acquaintances he has are former stars-including his older brother-of a popular 90s Pee-Wee's Playhouse-looking expy called The Happytime Gang, of which its cast comprises of other puppets and one human character, Jenny (Elizabeth Banks).Philips is brought on as a consultant to the LAPD when members of the cast start dying, and this brings him face-to-face with his ex-partner Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy), who testified against him, thus costing him his tenure. In a hilarious supporting role is Philips' secretary, known only as Bubbles (Maya Rudolph), who subverts the ditzy cliché. The race to find the killer feels drawn out but there are plenty of laughs along the way.It may feel like it's trying to cap onto a success like Team America: World Police, Happytime has its own charm, which is carried by McCarthy and Barretta in their constant back-and-forth banter, and a multitude of eccentric characters, although the latter really only applies to its fluffy cast. Joel McHale's FBI agent role merely exists as an antagonistic punching bag, and Leslie David Baker's lieutenant earns a few chuckles.In the end, if you're looking for smart, go watch Mission: Impossible or something. This is for turning your brain off and finding humor in sex jokes and silly string ejaculating puppets. And if you're a parent who thinks 'Oh, look! Fluffy puppets must mean it's for children', you're either one of those people who got mad when you realized Sausage Party wasn't for children or you really don't care about the impending therapy bills.",The Happytime Murders

177,EnoVarma,"Not ""Meet the Feebles 2""",5,22 August 2018,"Firstly, it's not as good. Also, it has real actors. I was expecting ""The Happytime Murders"" to either be abysmal or brilliant, but as it turns out, it falls somewhere in between.It's perfectly competently made. And it's short: just over 80 minutes plus the end credits. The main puppet character, P.I. Phil Philips, is very good and carries the movie through its more unsuccessful parts. The first part of the story - provided that you enjoy raunchy humour - is surprisingly entertaining (and good looking). Another surprise is the amount of improv: the puppeteers are so good at what they do, that they can ad-lib, which is impressive.Unfortunately, the story lacks punch and freshness. The last 15 minutes really drops the rating. That, and the fact, that the movie is never as funny as you'd want it to be. So, there you have it. I still enjoyed it more than I expected.What about Melissa McCarthy? Well, personally I find her to be very talented. In ""The Happytime Murders"" she's ok, she has great technique and a great sense of timing, but she relies too much on familiar tricks, and only shines on a couple of occasions.The real scene stealer therefore is Maya Rudolph, who is very sweet and brings the movie a lot of heart all while being very funny. Maya and Phil the Puppet actually have chemistry. The other puppets are fine, a mixed bag of jokes that land and others that don't. ""Meet the Feebles"" is way better in this respect, as well.---Some musings on the origins of ""The Happytime Murders"". The humour in the movie is very crude. It feels like Brian Henson and co. threw up all the R-rated behind the scenes jokes of Sesame Street of the last 50 years into this 80-minute comedy. The roots of this type of comedy can be traced into mid-70's. Mel Brooks (""Blazing Saddles"", 1974) was among the pioneers, soon followed by Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker (""Kentucky Fried Movie"", 1977) and especially by the National Lampoon magazine, who inspired a slew of movies like ""Animal House"" (1978) and ""Vacation"" (1983). (Not to forget Steve Martin's unbelievable ""The Jerk"" (1979), still the greatest comedy of the sub-genre.)There was a ""slump"" for these type of comedies in the late 80's and early 90's - excluding Peter Jackson with ""Meet the Feebles"" (1989) and ""Braindead"" (1992). Then came the Farrellys and their ""Dumb and Dumber"" (1994), which really made crude, scatological comedy mainstream in the U.S. and globally.""The Happytime Murders"" belongs to the most recent wave of outrageous comedy, which has the distinction of being female-driven: Kristen Wiig's ""Bridesmaids"" (2011) is a milestone, and it featured two women appearing in ""The Happytime Murders"", Rudolph and McCarthy. Their co-star, Elizabeth Banks, made a similar bad-taste-comedy in 2008, ""Zack And Miri Make a Porno"". The movies may not always be very successful as such, but the skills of these actresses are undeniable and bring a freshness to the proceedings.Apart from the mentioned, ""The Happytime Murders"" is explained, apparently, by Brian Henson's side project, ""Puppet Up!"", an R-rated live show he's had going on for the past few years.Summa summarum, I think - to my surprise - I'd like to see a sequel to THM. A sequel that improves on this one and fulfills the potential of the concept. The makers have the means and the talent to pull it off.",The Happytime Murders

It's time to stop giving her pass. She is funny ONLY in skits and small doses, but her tired, Chris Farley-retread act has long since worn thin. Her delivery is awful and she uses that annoying voice and bumbling choreography to mask the fact that she just...isn't...funny.Of all of her embarrassments, Happytime Murders represents the true ""bottom"".

210,Reelnerd,Puppet buddy cop movie,6,26 August 2018,"Reel Review: The Happytime Murders
By Nelson Nantanapibul
Directed by Brian Henson
Starring: Melissa McCarthy, Elizabeth Banks, Maya Rudolph, Leslie David Baker, Joel McHale, Bill Barretta, Dorien Davies.
 Take the premise of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and substitute toons with puppets and you have the plot of The Happytime Murders. Bill Barretta voices the main puppet protagonist Phil Phillips an ex LAPD detective who moonlights as a PI after an incident involving his partner gets him removed from the force. 
 A lot of the best jokes in the film were showcased in the trailer but there are a few gems peppered throughout the film. There is a bit of a racial metaphor in this film where puppets are treated as second tier citizens who are the victims of various forms of discrimination but in no way does this film take that premise too seriously. This film is first and foremost a raunchy buddy cop movie plain and simple. 
 This film could have used a bit more satire in its premise as opposed to just trying to take the cheap laughs that being said I am not against a cheap laugh. This film had some nice puppet work in it but as for the premise and plot of the film it did not break any new ground. I mentioned a similarity to Roger Rabbit but one difference is this film lacks the heart and wonderment of the former. 
 This is a good film to check out with some buddies during a matinee and to have a few laughs with. Melissa Mccarthy and Maya Rudolph are really great and fun in this film. Elizabeth Banks has a fairly minor role in the film and quite frankly I am surprised she even thought it would be a good idea to take on this role but she does the best with what little she has to do in it. 
 If you are a fan of raunchy R rated comedies then this is the film for you. If not then you may be turned off by the gratuitos nature of some of the jokes in this film. It's definitely not for everyone.",The Happytime Murders

In addition, the whole movie is surrounded by insignificant characters and ""leans"" to a trivial plot. Of course, there are many films with a trivial plot that are still beautiful, but what makes them so, is all that is around the plot (characters, joke, special effects, settings and so on ...), But in this movie the plot is surrounded by the absolute ""nothing"".

So, here I am, pleasantly surprised with this one. I found it hilariously crude - the talk, the scenes etc; I was in absolute stitches. You have to have a good sense of humour to watch this and if you're the prudent one, then you are not going to enjoy this, you are going to find yourself very uncomfortable. McCarthy's on screen relationship with her ex detective partner (puppet) was genuinely believable. At times I forgot that she was actually talking to puppets; you instantly fall in love with them all because of the good story telling and pace to the movie.

225,tbuchalski,"The Happytime Murders: My Good, Bad, and Ugly",6,21 May 2019,"The Good:
While it is an underwhelming turn for Melissa McCarthy, she does share a few moments of razor sharp comedic wit and timing that has made her so popular since Bridesmaids (Paul Feig, 2011). Her biting insults and one-liners are reminiscent of the same that made Vince Vaughn a must-see in his films from the mid to late 2000's with the frat pack. Ultimately, this film functions as a worthwhile distraction as it pangs with the nostalgic adult with fond memories of daytime television from youth loaded with puppets and cartoons while also playing to desires for a more mature kind of humor.The Bad:
It's a puppet movie. While I admire the effort and time it took to build a movie where actors and puppets occupy the same diegetic space, the film never really made me forget that. It was more an examination of how filmmakers could tell the same raunchy jokes with puppets as a new gimmick, than a film with a solid story and good performances. It's clear from start to finish that this film is concerned more with the shock value and raunchy humor of R-rated puppets than it is with a well-rounded narrative made more nuanced with puppets.The Ugly:
It's hard to argue artistic value of a movie with puppets, but a movie that did it right as ""right"" as it can be done is The Muppets (James Bobin, 2011). It's safe to say at this point that films with puppets have been more successful, at least in terms of popularity or box office success, as films for all ages. Muppets was cleverly funny with jokes flying over the heads of children that their parents or other adults understand. And, the story was well structured to keep you from thinking ""this is just a film with puppets,"" even while making self-reflexive pokes at the films that established the conventions.",The Happytime Murders

Seeing so many full body shots of a puppet that moves around with human hands. And shots of him crawling through stuff. Had to be pretty complicated. The plot was decent, murder mystery where everyone of the cast of an old tv show gets murdered one by one.Here's where things go wrong. Any scene with Melissa Mcarthy seems way too improvised. Every one of them just seems aimless and goes off the rails. Just terrible comedic timing and not to mention, she just doesn't shut up. None of her jokes land because she doesn't let them. She keeps adding and adding and adding!I use to love Melissa Mcarthy. She was great in bridesmaids and actually pretty good in the The Heat. Which makes me wonder, how did she do so terribly in this buddy cop comedy? Maybe because she doesn't do well with that perticular character dynamic? I dont know to tell you. But my honest opinion is if you let Mcarthy adlib too much, you end up with a bad movie. Thats what happened in Ghostbusters. She starts to ramble in circles like she doesn't know where she's going with stuff.Is it worth the watch? I'd say yes, it's still very entertaining to see puppets being vulgar.

If Jim Henson's son doing naughty things to his father's toys is your thing, this is the comedy for you. The jokes range from mildy funny to ""What the Hell did I just""... Not for the squeamish, there are several instances of explicit puppet on puppet/human action that will make you laugh as much as cringe. The mystery is intriguing, yet predictable. At first entertaining, the constant foul language does eventually become tiring. ""I get it. Your puppets cuss."" You leave having had some chuckles, but maybe in need of a good, hard bath. There is a fun behind-the-scenes, mid-credits blooper reel. The cast appears to have had more fun making it than you might have watching it.

235,Gpanther67,Early front runner for Razzie awards,3,25 August 2018,"The ideal of a movie involving puppets, crime and dirty jokes seems like an interesting, possibly entertaining ideal on paper but the results in Brian Henson's (son of Muppet creator Jim Henson) ode to the buddy cop/film noir genre is about the least amusing and disappointing film I have seen in a long time. Yes, you can't help but compare the film to the classic ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", which in itself was a slightly risqué movie that attracted kids but had hints of adult humor. But the makers of Roger Rabbit were smart enough not to let the jokes get too crass and out-of-line, but Henson pulls no punches. I guess he thinks the joke of puppets talking filthy, doing drugs (in this case sugar instead of cocaine) and performing graphic sex acts & murder is something that can fill a movie. But in reality, it gets old quick and the notion of hand puppets in an R rated film becomes too absurd to be entertaining. Mainly, it relies of the ideal that these are puppets doing all of the adult acts instead of actually filling the film with honest humor. ""South Park"" is an animated show that even uses elementary kids in extremely vulgar situations but the humor is sharp, brilliant even. Happytime is lazy with their jokes, using a puppet octopus performing in a porno film or fluffy rabbits watching a stripper do her routine with a carrot as their big jokes. We might laugh at the absurdity but we aren't laughing because it's the type of jokes that will sustain us throughout the film. Even worse is the casting of Melissa McCarthy in yet another rude, dirty talking character that is supposed to be funny because she talks like a sailor on shore leave but its just the same type she keeps regurgitating on audiences over and over. Maybe there are people out there who just love to see McCarthy scream ""F&#@ You!!"" over and over, like it's a brilliant comedy line but for me she is overrated due to her limited repertoire. The plot revolves around a clichéd storyline involving a disgraced puppet police detective, Phil Phillips, who has to perform private eye work and finds a case he is working on is tied to a murder investigation his ex-partner Detective Connie Edwards (McCarthy) is assigned to. The victims are cast members of a popular puppet sitcom from the 80s that was due to go into syndication called ""The Happytime Gang"". His brother and former lover were in the show and turn out as victims to a mysterious killer who seems hellbent to wipe out everyone involved with the show. The private eye and his partner are at odds because of a falling out between them twelve years ago. Edwards was being held at gunpoint by a puppet criminal, and Phil tried to take the shot, but he missed and hit a male puppet bystander, killing him in front of his young daughter. The thug shot Edwards, but she killed him before he got away. The wound to her liver was so severe that Phil had no choice but to take her to a nearby puppet hospital to get a puppet replacement liver. Edwards later testified against Phil, and he was thrown off the force, with a law put in place to prevent puppets from being cops. Although they are both opposed to it, they are forced to work together to crack the case. The film is simply built around the one joke that half the cast is performed by puppets even though the material is something from a bad, R-rated cop film. Scenes of violence are supposed to come across as humorous because instead of blood and guts we see cotton stuffing all over the place. Gratuitous and graphic sex scenes are meant to be less vulgar and more amusing because its puppets doing them. And watching puppets talking dirty is just supposed to be funny, but it isn't and that's where this film fails horribly. I'm pretty sure Jim Henson is turning in his grave; his son has really tarnished the image and legacy of his father's work with a pitiful and worthless film. Melissa McCarthy really needs to discover some other sort of character to play.

243,MarkyMarkus,Raunchy jokes+no wit+Puppet sex=A very unpleasant time at the movies,4,25 August 2018,"I will be upfront and blunt, I hated this movie. You would have a better time buying a hand puppet and.... um, well you know. Sorry for the crude humor, but that is literally all you get with this movie anyways, so consider that joke a good substitute for the movie.First, the plot. It's your standard murder mystery in the style of a noire film from the 40's with a huge dosing of comedy. It involves a series of puppet murders and It takes a detective and her former puppet partner to crack the case. The movie however feels incomplete with vital scenes missing and almost no development of secondary characters. By the end I was wondering why the two were being celebrated as heroes. The audience know everything that happened, but the police force sure as hell doesn't, so they would have had them thrown in prison. I have heard people compare it to Roger Rabbit, but while that movie was actually a good murder mystery, this movie is more interested in being funny.... a shame really because it is not funny. Speaking about that...
The biggest crime a comedy can commit is to not be funny, and boy does this movie need the book thrown at it. Let me be clear, I am no prude, crude humor can be great. In fact, I was hoping this movie would be like a favorite of mine, Team America, but that movie actually was a clever commentary on US foreign policy and Hollywood hidden behind some really funny, absurdist humor. This movie has none of that. All the jokes are the easiest jokes you can think of. You already know what the punchline will be before it happens. I chuckled at maybe 3 jokes, but everything else fell flatter than Kansas. They also tried to thrown in a racial prejudice allegory, but it goes absolutely nowhere. Lastly, they play Rick Astleys 'Never gonna give you up' and Carly Rae Jepsens 'Call me maybe'... that is the type of humor we are dealing with and yes, they were absolutely trying to be funny. I mean, it's totally funny that the no nonsense FBI agent is listing to a pop song.

258,SCIFIshant,"Great Potential, Poor Execution",6,13 September 2018,"The Happytime Murders is a film that really tried and I really do feel that they put their all into making this film, but it seems like an extremely tricky formula to pull off. I mean, when is the last time you heard of an explicit detective movie starring puppets?! I feel as though this plot was doomed from the start, but I am impressed by the effort that went into the film. The puppets look phenomenal and strongly detailed which gives the film that signature Henson look. Another thing I loved about this film was the retro car that Phil Philips drove because it gave the movie so much more charm. The story in the film revolves around a puppet detective by the name of Phil Phillips. Phil needs to solve a murder mystery with his arch-rival Connie Edwards who was also ironically his co-worker. This results in extremely crazy dialogue and action. There are scenes though that are too over-done and totally strange which had me thinking ""What was that?!"" rather than laughing. The sexual scenes in the film were disturbing to the point where I felt that they were too overdone even for an R-rated film. The end results in betrayal because the individual who had committed the murders and crimes was the same puppet that opened up the murder case in the first place! This did not really surprise me because the story was somewhat predictable due to the fishy situations and interactions between the different characters. Overall I feel as though this movie aimed for the stars but hit the ground hard. They tried making a great film and they would have been close with some tweaking, but making an R-rated crime movie starring puppets is very hard to do therefore I applaud them on that part.",The Happytime Murders
259,marlon_jackson,Hard Boiled Detective Story,10,9 September 2018,"This is a solid detective flick in the vein of The Maltese Falcon, The Big Lebowski, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. You have a hard drinking private detective with smoke hanging out of his mouth every scene. Sure, he has a past. He was a cop who was run out of the force by bad luck. His having to team up with his former partner sets the stage for him trying to stop a killing spree by a maniac with personal vendetta against the world.
I think I understand a lot of the negative reviews. Some meat sacks can't stand to see a strong and proud puppet in a leading role. They don't even view puppets as people! Just because someone is made of felt and stuffing does that mean they don't bleed? Do you think just because someone has glued on eyeballs, they don't cry?

265,courtney_london,"The movie was better than I expected, but still average at best.",6,27 August 2018,"This is definitely not your typical Christmas special, or holiday time variety The Muppets show. You can tell from the trailers this is definitely not a movie the kids will/should watch.
The movie was better than I expected, but still average at best.
The movie is shot in a similar style as Who Framed Roger Rabbit where cartoons, and in this case muppets, live in a real world with humans. Former cop Phillip Phillips (muppet voiced by Bill Barretta) is paired with his former partner Detective Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy) to solve the multiple muppet murders that seem to be surrounding one group of TV stars.
This movie is barely over 90 minutes which I thought was a good length; not too many long drawn out scenes, and kept the flow of the mystery going until the very end.
I did laugh out loud multiple times during the movie, some of the jokes were too good to contain! The sex scenes in the movie (all muppets) are raunchy and quite cringe worthy, and maybe go on just a little too long for the viewers liking.
The puppeteering in the movie is absolutely fantastic, being able to watch some of the unedited scenes while the credits roll is incredibly impressive.
Not a horrible movie, but I would suggest this as a 'watch at home' flick.",The Happytime Murders

If that grosses you out, stay away.I, on the other hand, thought The Happytime Murders was hilarious. I genuinely laughed out loud from start to finish. It was certainly gross and absurd and had plenty of shock value...but it was also funny as hell...and most of the rest of the theater was laughing as well.It doesn't necessarily mean that you don't have a sense of humor if you didn't like the movie...you may just have a different sense of humor than I do. Part of the problem is that the movie wasn't promoted very well. To say it's not for everyone, is a huge understatement but it was definitely a perfect movie night out for me.Those that like it, will laugh out loud.

271,fegamer,"Waste of Time, Waste of Money, Waste of Potential",2,26 August 2018,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought that this was going to be a new an innovative take on adult comedy especially with Brian Henson directing. And trust me the marketing was very good. But in reality, we got 90 minutes of a very predictable mess filled with nothing but vulgar jokes that sound like something made by a 13-year-old. When will writers realize that just adding shock value, saying swear words, and putting in random sex jokes in a movie doesn't make it more adult? If anything it's more childish especially when you overdo it. And don't even get me started on how they used silly string as semen.But lets get to the plot, again very predictable. In the first few minutes of the film our hero, Phil Phillips and other puppets are banned from being an officer after trying to shoot a criminal but instead shoots an innocent bystander in front of his daughter by accident. And in the present day, we see that Phil is now a private investigator approached by the predictable femme fatale because she's being blackmailed.Later on we see the murders taking place where the ex cast members of the Happy Time Gang are getting killed off one by one. While they're investigating the remaining cast members most of the movie's plot is riddled with tons of genital humor filler content that wouldn't even change the plot if it was taken out. Seriously, most of this film was just poorly written filler. Heck the genital jokes were so rampant that they literally made pubic hair an essential plot point. Which also fits into how predictable this movie is because our femme fatale character is the bad guy all along because she was the daughter of the guy Phil accidentally killed and she wants revenge for what happened. Like we didn't see this coming at all. It tries to be like an R rated muppets but it's not and even the live action cast members can't bring any drop of quality to this movie. If you want some good puppet movies, dust off your old muppet DVDs. If you want adult puppet entertainment, then watch an Avenue Q bootleg. Save your money and time with this film and if you want a bad movie night wait for this to come on Netflix.",The Happytime Murders
272,ken-hall-135-892182,Worst movie I've seen in years.,1,27 August 2018,No story and in very poor taste. This is like a muppet version of Hangover. It isn't funny and has no value to the future of anything in society.,The Happytime Murders
273,dejected_jedi,Comedy is the real victim here.,2,26 August 2018,"For years moviegoers have had to deal with what I call the ""preview problem,"", a term I just pulled out of my nether regions. The preview problem is easy to explain: the folks that make movie previews have one job and one job only, and that is to sell the film they are advertising. The trouble begins with the fact that they have gotten very good at this. It doesn't matter the quality or type of film or even if you end up liking it or not. These guys could not care less about audiences' opinions if they came in a book labeled ""The Picture Book of Colonoscopies."" As soon as those butts are comfortably ensconced in theater seats their job is done. And they will go to some pretty far lengths in order get that essential opening weekend box office moolah: From showing scenes that are not actually in the finished film to giving a completely wrong expectation of the movie in question. And so, with come to The Happytimes Murders, a film that overpromises and disappoints worst than a teenage boy on prom night. On its face, the premise presented on the trailer is almost genius in its simplicity. What if we had a Muppets movie for adults? The analogy is not entirely glib being the movie was directed by the revered Jim Henson's own son, Brian, making his feature-length debut. By all expectations this should have been if not a hilarious sleeper hit, then at the very least, a little funny. It is not. What went wrong? It's not the fact the writers throw every tired old detective movie cliché at the screen in an attempt to remake ""The Maltese Falcon"" with puppets and foul language. And it is also not the issue that, as shown in the trailer, puppets simulating sex is NOT inherently funny. Team America proved that premise could be hilarious that 14 years ago. 
No, the trouble is that the writers et al. forgot that what makes Muppets, cartoons and marionettes interesting in the first place is that they live by their own set of rules. Consider the classic ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" Cartoons living in a human world but following cartoon rules. Putting puppets in a human world, obeying human rules misses the point of puppets completely and makes for a film that annoys rather than entertain. If anything, this just proves that you can't just throw a bunch of curse words and sex jokes and expect a hit.But even all that could be forgiven if the film didn't commit the worst sin of all and that is misusing a particular stellar cast of comedians. Maya Rudolph, Joel McHale, Elizabeth Banks and Michael McDonald have maybe 3 minutes of funny screen time between them. And while ostensibly the film is about a murder mystery, not making Melissa McCarthy funny is the real crime here.",The Happytime Murders

Those two ladies took a pretty lousy script and turned it into something entertaining and at times, quite funny. There is a section where just the two of them were together in a scene, and for a moment, I thought the director should have pivoted and focused on the story from thier perspective. That said, Melissa and Maya were able to put lipstick on that pig. I think Bubbles (Maya) should have her own movie, or at least her own special with Connie (Melissa) as her muscle. The film itself does not have an intelligently written script. It has the sex and violence of Game of Thrones without a well thought-out plot, shoddy writing, directing, dialog and production value. But that doesn't mean it was unwatchable. If you suspend all notions of the critics and focus on the absurdity of the zany characters, I guarantee you will enjoy the movie.Would I see it again? I would take my raunchiest friends to a matinee. I would probably tell them to lower their expectations, and then they would thoroughly enjoy the film. As for the critics of this film?

Just as one cannot say that all animated movies are for children's eyes - ""Felix The Cat"" springs to mind - the same can be said for puppet-populated movies. Parents and grandparents should check before bringing their little ones to ANY movie.
I loved this movie! I had loved the Muppets, especially Animal and Gonzo and, of course, Kermit, that pig-loving frog. This movie gave me Muppets who were as human and fault-laden as real people are, then cast them in a film noir setting. Fabulous!

316,Squirrel_the_Grip_1,"Love, Drugs, and Puppets",7,11 November 2019,"So my review on The Happytime Murders, Don't listen to critic scores on this one. The movie is well crafted by Brian Henson and his team at Henson Alternative (HA!) with over 120 puppets and puppeteers making this film. Though the film has raunchy, vulgar, and foul mouth puppets deep down the movie is a noir film about a P.I. puppet and human detective tracking down a murderer in Los Angeles. I thought all the acting done by both puppeteers and humans were fantastic and kept me engaged with the story. Jokes were hit and miss but solid story. As a disclaimer: THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!",The Happytime Murders

318,cuzinit-90838,Much Better Than Most Reviews Make It Seem,10,4 August 2019,"Based on some reviews I wasn't sure what to expect, but Happytime Murders was actually much better than I thought it would be! The humor was on point and Melissa McCarthy was fantastic! You would never know she was working with a puppet partner if it weren't for him being, well, a puppet!
I would love to see more of these films be produced as they have a certain nostalgia attached to them. The puppets grew up with us. We don't make the same jokes we did when we were kids. Neither should they! For adults this is a great film that let's you feel that mischeviois inner humor, kind of like when you heard dirty jokes as a teenager. I loved pretty much every moment of this and the creativity behind it. The cast and crew did an amazing job with camera angles and dialogue, as well as managed to impart an absolutely hysterical story line. Not to mention, it was produced by Brian Henson, the son of Jim Henson!!
I personally found Happytime Murders to be a highlight in comedy that has been missing for some time. It broke the mold of the same old as we've seen recently in many lackluster comedies. The creativity and the cast and crew made this film a standout in the comedy genre and truly provided one of the most unique and hysterical comedies I've seen in a very long time!Many reviews are often posted by those who feel outrage and not as often by those who enjoy films or shows. That often kills franchises prematurely without due cause. So, please... If you liked it, give it a review too!",The Happytime Murders

331,ntaradilis,Most offensive thing is it just isn't funny,1,24 August 2018,"The most offensive thing a comedy can do is not make you laugh. The tired setting, slow pace, juvenile attempts at humour, and lack of any characterisation beyond poorly sketched stereotype has rendered one of the least enjoyable cinematic experiences I've ever had. The Happytime Murders centres around puppet ex-cop-turned-hard-boiled-noir-PI Phil Phillips (Bill Barretta) tracking down a serial killer who has killed his famous brother. He is aided by his former partner Detective Edwards (Melissa McCarthy) who was responsible for Phil's fall from grace. The premise of a puppet-human buddy cop movie is ludicrous and enticing enough to make a good comedy. The sad reality is a humdrum plodding through an uninspired dingy puppet stuffed world. The murders all occur within Phil's presence, which leads to the unsatisfyingly predictable police hunt of Phil, the FBI's pointless involvement, and Edwards confronting her warped hatred of Phil for saving her life to return the favour. All the above could be forgiven if the jokes were at least entertaining or witty enough to propel the film. Unfortunately, despite a wealth of comedic talent, and a solid idea, a strike rate of two laughs is not worth the other 91 minutes of utter boredom. The Happytime Murders plays out like a Saturday Night Live skit that overstays its welcome. Don't bother giving this a cursory glance, instead watch Sausage Party again.0.5 Stars",The Happytime Murders
332,iansquidish,Perfectly enjoyable for what it is.,5,30 August 2018,"An interesting mix of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Team America: World Police that sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. This film doesn't pretend to be anything other than a raunchy comedy and doesn't hold back on the gross-out humor. Performances were a bit on the splotchy side and it's easy to tell the scenes where Melissa McCarthy is improvising vs. her scripted scenes. The actual puppeteering is very well done (I would expect nothing less given the involvement of Jim Hensons's son). Overall, the gimmick and little moments are more than enough to make up for the movie's shortcomings, making it very enjoyable, though still not any sort of masterpiece.",The Happytime Murders

But this movie was just awful. I saw it opening weekend and I counted 3 times the audience laughed the entire movie and it wasn't a resounding one.

But man were they few and far between.First off, these puppets were created so horribly. Most look like lifeless stuffed animals that you'd find at a garage sale. There's no life to them. Especially Sandra, the promiscuous client. Zero emotion in her face. Just plain cringy. Jim Henson would be mortified.Secondly, Melissa McCarthy did a horrible job in this film. I've tried not to jump on the Melissa hate train, because I grew up watching Gilmore Girls and absolutely adored her, but she really needs to improve her acting and comedic delivery. If you've seen one Melissa McCarthy movie, you have seen them all. Just watch Bridesmaids, it's truly the only consistently good character she has portrayed.Thirdly, I am so tired of movies using perverted humor to make films ""mature."" This could have been a really good adult puppet movie. What we need is relatable adult matters or some complex storylines with heart. Adults don't just have sex all day, nor do we find it particularly funny. There are some really disgusting scenes in this movie that drag on for an embarrassingly long time. The Dark Crystal captivates me as an adult more than this film ever would, and it's a children's film!Don't waste your money on this movie, it deserves to fail big time.",The Happytime Murders

It was very fun to see what the muppets would be like if they lived in our society and had to deal with struggles of being second class citizens. This is very much not a movie for the easily offended or if you want to keep that pristine image of the muppets you had growing up. Yes, there is a detective story driving the whole thing forward and it is a very cheesy one at that (dont worry, you will get the joke when you watch). But that is NOT the point. The muppets are selfish, rude and all manner of nasty and that's kinda the point. Watch every other successful comedy and that is exactly the charming and relatable characters you will find. Just a whole lot more amplified. Using puppets is the perfect driver for that sort of thing because you can get away with such over the top antics.

373,jamie_strong,Fully planned to enjoy raunchy puppets but...,3,5 December 2018,"Years ago I dragged my siblings to a play about a possessed by evil hand puppet that takes over a young outcasts life at vacation bible study. My brother in law may never forgive me. So when I saw the Henson brand for adults I was ready to jump in. It's your basic detectives on the outs procedural with puppets as 2nd class citizens and Melissa McCarthy playing the Melissa McCarthy role of slapstick, bumbling, crude, fool. That was the sticking point for me. I'm so tired of Mcarthy playing the same stereotype, and playing it poorly. This could have been a great ""bad"" movie instead it was just a well made bad movie.",The Happytime Murders
374,kephrarubin,Hilarious,8,28 February 2021,I avoided seeing this because I figured it would just be weird and boy was I wrong... I was weird and hilarious. The whole premise is rediculous and my girlfriend and I couldn't stop laughing. You need to like dark comedies to really get the humor. If you're into the kind of humor from gross Pointe blank or Mr. Right and like old detective movies you'll probably dig it. I think the problem is this movie is so niche it was hard to market. Shame it didn't do better by the end I wanted a sequel.,The Happytime Murders

376,NikiES,"I went in knowing nothing, and left feeling a little dirtier (spoiler-free)",5,29 August 2018,"I had a friend who really wanted to see this, so I agreed to go with him. I went in knowing nothing about the movie other than it was a ""dirty movie involving puppets."" I loved Team America, so I thought why not?Well, let me start off by saying this is no Team America. The Happytime Murders has some great one-liners and a couple of funny scenes, but overall is just mediocre. The story follows an ex-puppet cop and his old partner as they try to get to the bottom of a series of murders. The story plays out decently, even if it isn't super original in its concept.Yes, this movie is super raunchy, and even I was surprised by how far some of the one-liners took it. However, these are the scenes I found to be some of the most funny because you grow up being instilled with the idea that puppets are for kids, so to see them doing unimaginable acts and saying unspeakable things is pretty damn hilarious.If you are looking for a couple good laughs and a way to kill some time, feel free to see this movie. I wouldn't recommend it for the theater, but would definitely say it is worth a borrow from the library or a Netflix watch, especially if they release an extended or unrated version. In my opinion, the movie was far too short, and left quite a few things open-ended, so it might be worth it even more if they release an extended version. Plus, gag reels are always a good time.",The Happytime Murders

This was brilliant, funny and fantastically produced! Brian Henson at his best. As near as I can tell, most of the negative reviews are from people that just don't like Melissa McCarthy and hate everything she does. I thought she did a great job! It takes a lot of talent to have such chemistry between a person and a puppet. She is awesome!I can't wait to see the making of feature when it is released. If you do see this in the theater, and I highly recommend you do, watch the end credits for some behind-the-scenes moments.Great movie!!",The Happytime Murders

They had a good blend of adding and all the outrageous adult puppet comedy moments and also good use of Storytelling when it came to making this like a regular cop movie. Though I was expecting a little bit more outrageous puppet moments for what they had it will do.and to those people who think this is shaming what Jim Henson did when he was alive then you are totally wrong. you need to watch all the Brian Henson interviews where he talks about the movie because a lot of what they did in this movie is similar to what Jim Henson did behind the scenes when the cameras weren't rolling.If your true Henson and puppet fan then you will love this movie.,The Happytime Murders
384,blakemorse,A Funny Buddy Cop Movie Where The Jokes Just Didn't Land,6,28 August 2018,"This buddy cop movie directed by Brian Henson, son to the famous puppeteer Jim Henson, packs a surprisingly funny and shocking punch to this already interesting concept. Starring Melissa McCarthy alongside a shorter and certainly fuzzier version of Bill Barretta, the film takes place in modern day Los Angeles and focuses around the relationship between McCarthy and Barrettas characters. But unfortunately, in spite of having a few good laughs and even a few more jaw dropping moments, the movies jokes most of the time fell flat and just felt awkward. As well some jokes fall flat, the use of characters seemed to not fit. For example Leslie David Baker; who's known for his role on The Office, his character just seemed to appear at weird times and failed to deliver any real funny dialogue. In addition to to having bad characters, there were also good characters who didn't get their deserved screen time, such as the character Goofer, who was both funny and surprisingly lovable. So overall this is a funny cop movie that has a few laughs but overall fails to deliver the jokes it was trying to pull off.",The Happytime Murders

But don't be mistaken, this movie is really more inline with a 40s noire with comedy elements, and puppets. It's world is seedy, dark and disturbing, and the comedy exists to lighten the mood, not be the substance of the movie.In that respect, Happytime Murders does very well, considering it makes us actually feel for the puppets that are being murdered, despite the fact that their gruesome deaths are really just stuffing flying all over the place.

432,whkirwan,"Not as bad as critics say, but is still just okay.",4,24 August 2018,"Before going and seeing this answer these questions; Do you like puppets? Do you not mind crude humor? Do you not mind seeing the same tropes being played out as long as you see sometime new? If you answered to at least two of these, go see it. 
I will start I would like to say that I am probably the ideal audience for this movie. I love the Muppets as I was Growing up. I love Avenue Q and frequently attend adult puppet shows. I even have performed in a few puppet slams. So I may have a different perspective on this movie than most people would.First a few positives. The puppetry as always from Jim Henson Company is excellent and creative. The acting and humor is very on point. And as a parody of the murder mystery/Cop movie it's fine. It also didn't try to drag itself out two hours like a lot of comedies do.That said,I think it could've been better.I think the human to puppet split should've been about 50/50 but instead it's more 75/25. It makes the world of this movie felt either very plain or incomplete. 
And while the writing isn't bad in this it is very generic for this kind of movie. It's like every cop movie. PI was a cop but gets kicked off the force for a screw-up. PI meets former partner because they're working the same case. The case has a twist (a good twist but you know their is one). By the end, Everyone gets over there flaws. It does let the jokes shine but a more mold breaking story couldn't hurt. 
But probably it's biggest weakness is that it doesn't really go far enough.I don't like crude humor just for crude humor but a lot of times it seems like it's trying to hold back. For example, a character goes to a strip club and there is no nude, lap-dances, or even outfits on the strippers that are very slutty; they look like clothes some women wear on a hot summer day. I don't know if this was because it would've gone in NC-17 by the ever wise MPA or they're going to do an unrated cut when it's released video. Either way, I definitely think it was a missed opportunity. I say if you're willing to go out and see it while it's in theaters I definitely think you should.But in my opinion I would wait untilIt comes out for rent.",The Happytime Murders

It wasn't funny, it wasn't so shocking I couldn't handle it, it certainly wasn't remotely the avant-guard wit-fest it seemed to think it was. What it was, was like watching a flushed turd slowly circle it's way down a toilet bowl, unable to disappear fast enough. It was nothing but one sleazy potty joke after another that even a child would find pathetic and just plain STUPID.Need I finish by saying, don't anybody waste a penny on this hopeless waste?

From the moment this film started, the four of us who went to the cinema were crying with laughter. I can't understand why it's getting so many bad reviews. Ok Melissa McCarthy isn't great in it but the puppet roles are hilarious. It was filthy, smutty toilet humour from start to finish. This is what we expected and this is what we got. Most of the other reviewers on here must have been born with a stick up their backsides. How they claim to have not laughed at all is beyond me.

I finally cracked one night recently when I caught the segment with the silly string. I'm not giving anything away, here, but I was simultaneously mortified and laughing so hard, it hurt. Since that interlude, I've watched it 4 times and am currently on my fifth.
Is this an artistic approach to the media of cinema? Absolutely not. It was clearly never intended to be.
I'd say if you're a fan of South Park, Drawn Together, and anything similar, this is worth checking out.",The Happytime Murders

I knew there'd be some haters of this movie but I'm surprised the overall score was so low. Apparently the # of people who gave it a score were skewed in o verly-haughty and snobbish movie goers, you know, those irritating sorts who refer to móviles as ""cinema"" and deem themselves ""patrons of the arts"". Seriously, get over yourselves. The puppeteering was masterful, Melissa McCarthy exuded raunchy humor and the plot was just complex enough to keep the audience interested. Yes, the best scenes are in the tráiler, as they're supposed to be, but there are some gems that aren't. For example, detective Phil (a Muppet) has been wrongly impresioned and the FBI agent (played by Joel McHale) comes to release him. Two other prisoners, one on each side, are pummeling him. Phil quips, ""You realize I have no bones. You're basically fluffing a pillow. ""And then there's McCarthy's response to her partner as to how the suspect (female Muppet) got the drop on her (she's on her shoulders with punching and grabbing the policewoman's head and facebook) : ""I was on her trail and then she dropped out of nowhere like a spider monkey. "" Or something like that. It's raunchy, hilarious satire. Don't bring young children but definitely bring yourself and an open mind.",The Happytime Murders

I'm so glad we did because otherwise I probably wouldn't have seen it since I hadn't heard of the movie at all (I hadn't seen any ads, trailers, or posters). We are still cracking up at some of the jokes and shockingly hilarious moments -- the whole theater was in tears.

We laughed a lot, about as much as any Melissa McCarthy movie we have seen. I don't know what people were expecting when going into this. It was raunchy humor and a very predictable story so everyone was able to focus on the humor. It is obvious that the production company didnt buy off top critics though. These seems to be the same people who rated awful blockbusters and phenomenal, and amazing cheap movies as terrible because they wouldnt pay more for good reviews. I would give it about a C+ on my scale. It delivered the predictable comedy I went in to see, and ended the way I expected. Its disheartening to see the absolutely horrible press reviews this movie is getting when they knly info they seem to provide is from the trailer. Imdb seemed to be the only review site not trying to cash in on tanking a movie that could be a decently entertaining evening for people with senses of humor.",The Happytime Murders

472,kbdckyle,A Disgrace to Jim Henson,1,28 August 2018,This movie is an utter disgrace to the man behind the art form. It's poorly written. It's cheaply made. The performances are totally lackluster. It drags on with a clichè story that takes forever. The puppeteering doesn't sync up. The puppets only have one emote facially. The only good thing about this movie is that it's getting some young puppeteers' names out. It starts out talking about how puppets are people too and it's degrading not to be seen as such and then only makes unfunny puppet jokes the entire movie. Save the money and go watch Team America or the recent ABC Muppets sitcom instead.,The Happytime Murders

There are a few over the top sexually explicit scenes, but they involve mostly puppets which made it hallirious, but not all of the movie relies on slap stick humor, as there are jokes and witty exchanges in conversation as well as an intersting plot. This movie was in my option underated considering most of the reviews , obviously family's shouldn't take their kids to see it, but it is a good comedy and the entire theater was lit up with laughter at all the innuendos, witty arguments, and funny puppet murder and sex scenes, it was a good watch!",The Happytime Murders

But it is one of those movies where the trailer has all the good jokes, and when you see the movie you don't laugh at them because you already saw them...and that's it.

It was raunchy, it was borderline disturbing, and I loved every minute of it. I will say the non comedy parts, or more accurately the plot, was a bit of a stretch in some places, and yes, the trailer was somewhat misleading about what the plot would be about. However, given what the trailer showed, I think we could all see what this movie was really going to be about: sex jokes with a puppet cast. If you're going in expecting this to be a huge, dramatic movie or even remotely serious, I suggest you re-watch a certain part of the trailer involving a certain detective in a certain office (you know what I mean).

If you ask me the movie was just a huge joke on Hollywood. Everyone is up in arms about how ""crass"" or ""disgusting"" the movie was, although I'm sure all of those people loved movies like...Ted, 21 Jump Street, Bad Grandpa and Jackass. and this movie is nothing in comparison to the raunchiness of those three. At first I thought it was going to be a disgrace to Jim Henson, I don't really think it was. I think it was different and for once not aimed at kids. The older generation grew up with the muppets and so of course it was aimed to them. Now did I think this movie was totally hilarious? no. But it was funny. It was basically a spoof on hollywood's typical crime/detective movies with a little crude humor in there.
