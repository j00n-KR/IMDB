0,SnoopyStyle,tough edgy school drama,7,30 December 2015,"Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody) is a substitute teacher with issues. His grandpa is in assisted living with dementia. Principal Carol Dearden (Marcia Gay Harden) is being pushed out. Artistic student Meredith is fascinated with Barthes. Ms. Madison (Christina Hendricks) is an idealistic teacher under stress. Dr. Doris Parker (Lucy Liu) is the struggling school counselor. Mr. Charles Seaboldt (James Caan) talks to kids bluntly. Barthes encounters hooker Erica (Sami Gayle) and tries to help her.I really like the stuff at school. I like the disjointed take from different characters. It's tough. It's edgy. It's disturbing. It's uncomfortable. On the other hand, Erica is too much of a trope. She's the hooker with a heart. Barthes becomes a white knight in shinning armor. It turns it into something slightly cheesy. That's the only squeaky wheel in an otherwise rolling movie.",Detachment
1,claudio_carvalho,Depressive View of a Sick and Dysfunctional Society,7,25 December 2013,"Henry Barthes (Adryen Brody) is a high-school substitute teacher emotionally detached from everyone but his grandfather. When he was a seven year-old boy, he saw his mother committing and he is a traumatized and sad man. Henry is assigned to work for one-month in a decadent public school and along this period, he meets the teenage prostitute Erica (Sami Gayle) on the streets and he brings her to his apartment to take care of her. In his class, he feels affection for the troubled student Meredith (Betty Kaye) and tries to help her. These adolescents change his emotions toward people. ""Detachment"" is a depressive view of the sick and dysfunctional modern society though the routine of a substitute teacher that makes the difference in the universe of teenagers, parents and other teachers. There are memorable scenes, like the breakdown of the counselor Dr. Doris Parker (Lucy Liu); or Henry explaining to the students the importance of reading to create their own thoughts and beliefs; or Henry saying that parenthood should require curriculum. On the other side, the reaction of Ms. Sarah Madison when Henry is hugging Meredith is impressive and part of a morally corrupted society that only can see vicious in a sympathetic gesture. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Substituto"" (""The Substitute"")",Detachment
2,kosmasp,Different approach,8,3 December 2013,"It could've gotten all ""Dangerous Minds"" on the viewer but it didn't. And it still sparks people to say that they think this will change them. It is not many movies that can say about themselves that they achieved that goal. And while Adrian Brody has made some weird acting choices of late, this movie suits him very well. It will be overlooked (it actually already has been overlooked), but it is a movie that dares to be different. A movie that takes its title literally and goes the whole nine yards with it.But it's not only the Brody show. Everyone involved in this (even the kid actors) are really good. It's funny, touching and dramatic sometimes in mere seconds apart. I don't think the movie will leave you without an impression. Even if it's the impression that you don't like it/the way it handled things. Visual and without many gimmicks it does what it says ...",Detachment
3,grantss,"Unoriginal, predictable, melodramatic yet dull",4,8 April 2015,"Unoriginal, predictable, melodramatic yet dull.Detachment doesn't tackle a new subject. Delinquent kids and teachers' inability to teach or control them has been a theme since the 1950s (Blackboard Jungle anyone?). However, with each of these sorts of movies you hope that there is something new to be added. If there are movies that add to the discussion, Detachment isn't one of them.Rather than try to present solutions, it just shows the problems. You would think Adrien Brody's character represents the solution but his character is too implausible to be true: idealistic and overly goody-two-shoesy. Plus, is he really the solution? (Any more and there'd be spoilers). If anything, the movie is telling us: don't be a teacher and, more broadly, don't have kids.The plot is quite predictable. Some events are signposted far in advance. The plot isn't hard to figure out in advance, especially as you have so much time to work it out, the movie progresses so slowly.Sure, there's heaps of melodrama, people throwing things, kids being all aggro, ridiculous dialogue and sub-plots, but it's fairly empty. Lots of pretense and bluster, but no substance.",Detachment
4,george.schmidt,The BLACKBOARD JUNGLE of the 21st century and one of the year's best films; Brody's best since THE PIANIST.,10,24 March 2012,"DETACHMENT (2012) **** Adrian Brody, Christina Hendricks, Marcia Gay Harden, Lucy Liu, James Caan, Blythe Danner, Tim Blake Nelson, William Petersen, Bryan Cranston, Sammi Gayle, Betty Kaye, Louis Zorich. Scathing indictment of the American educational system from agent provocateur filmmaker Tony Kaye features a terrific, low-key modulated performance by Brody (his best since copping the Oscar in THE PIANIST) as a haunted New York high school substitute teacher who finds himself at odds with the indifference, angst and anomie of his young charges and the push-pull relationship with a teen prostitute (amazing newcomer Gayle) he takes in under his wing. Brody's sad-sack demeanor and the most expressive eyes on screen since Bette Davis speaks volumes for his anguished character, Henry Barthes, and a stellar ensemble including Caan as a seen-it-all-world-weary colleague and veteran character actor Zorich as his dementia-addled grandfather. Kudos also to Kaye for using his real-life daughter Betty as Barthes' most loyal student with a burden to bare throughout the film until its heady climax that only falters in an otherwise fine screenplay by Carl Lund.

5,phd_travel,Touching and an interesting approach,8,28 July 2012,There have been quite a few inner city school movies highlighting the terrible conditions that both teachers and students face there. So why give this one a watch? Look at the cast - they wouldn't be doing this movie if it didn't have good material.This movie is quite well done and the approach is fresh and watchable with a realistic plot. The cast is good. Brody is quite touching as are the students. Hendricks is a little too pretty for the role but is lovely to watch.Overall a little depressing because of the serious subject matter but worth a watch.,Detachment
6,gradyharp,"Angst: A Brilliant, Compelling Mirror for Us All",10,19 March 2012,"DETACHMENT is an extraordinary achievement in filmmaking. Written by first time writer Carl Lund and directed by the controversial Tony Kaye (one would never know, but he performs music and comedy at open mics around Los Angeles), and presented by one of the finest ensemble casts imaginable, this film should be required viewing for everyone from junior high to the elderly. In one poignant story we are provided glimpses into the current status of our public education, the plight of burned out teachers attempting to repair the absent parent syndrome while reaching out to find a place beyond drugs, fighting, physical and mental abuse and the lethargy of responding to a chaotic world, and a dark view of the existentialism that allows each of us to forge ahead despite a sense of worth in a world gone crazy.Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody in a galvanizing performance) copes with life as a substitute teacher: he comes into schools for a specific stint then detaches and repeats the cycle of caring to provide hope for kids to become someone of significance, failing repeatedly. He is assigned to a New York school headed by the soon to be fired Principal Carol Dearden (Marcia Gay Harden), meets a classroom of foul mouthed, disrespectful, angry students and attempts to teach them English. He is immediately challenged by a sassy kid whom he sends out of the room, a young angry black student with whom he connects by showing him parameters of interaction, a young obese, disturbed but gentle Meredith (Betty Kay, in a sterling performance) among others. He also encounters the other teachers and staff - the beautiful Sarah Madison (Christina Hendricks), the school counselor Dr. Doris Parker (Lucy Liu), the burned out Mr. Wiatt (Tim Blake Nelson) and Ms Perkins (Blythe Danner) and Mr. Sarge Kepler (William Peterson), and only teacher who fights back with a sense of humor Mr. Charles Seaboldt (James Caan). It is a grim situation and Henry takes his depression home.Henry encounters a young girl Erica (Sami Gayle, in a career making role) who despite her youth is a street hooker, beaten badly by her johns. He offers her protection in his meager home - a place to sleep and eat and recover form the street abuse of her profession. A profound relationship develops - and while that satisfies Erica's desperate need for family, it frightens Henry enough to eventually call foster care to remove her. Henry visits his elderly mentally challenged Grandpa (Louis Zorich) who lives in a assisted living home and his frustrations about his memories of his apparently alcoholic suicidal mother and the lack of care being given his Grandpa results in one of Henry's rare explosions of anger - a rage that extends to every aspect of his view of life. At school Henry gradually wins the hearts and minds of his class, showing them that education is the path to living a life of meaning. His friendship with the beleaguered Meredith is supportive, but as Henry completes his three week assignment at the school tragedies surround him. It seems that everyone in the story is in a life and death struggle to find beauty in a seemingly vicious and loveless world.In addition to the actors mentioned there are shining little vignette roles by Celia Au, Renée Felice Smith, Kwoade Cross, and others - many appearing for the first time on film and each radiating talent. But the film belongs to Adrien Brody who provides such a staggeringly real character that his message is felt in every cell of the viewer's mind. This is a first rate film in every aspect. It should be seen by everyone who either shares the mental milieu of the characters depicted here or cares deeply about the sad chaotic situation we have created during these particular times.

7,StevePulaski,When the cold connect with the cold,9,12 October 2012,"Now here is a film I'm glad to see Adrien Brody in rather than the horribly tone-deaf and lackluster High School. To see Brody, an immensely talented man with an impeccably raw screen presence thanks to his pain-stricken facial expressions and ""common-man with baggage"" appearance, embody a role like he does in Tony Kaye's Detachment is nothing short of a sly miracle and a disappointing feat that it did not manage to drum up any attention or publicity upon its release.Brody plays Henry Barthes, a substitute teacher for a miserable, underfunded public school in New York City. The students are unambitious and compiled up mainly of delinquents, but were they nurtured in that direction or is it just nature and the fact that their roots sprouted in an underprivileged area? Mr. Barthes is hired to substitute for one month, teaching a high school English class. The experience begins on a sour note, with the students immediately holding a disdain for the man and being disruptive, cursing and harassing each other moments after meeting him. Not being taken seriously has to be one of the worst possible blows to a person regardless of any job title, but Mr. Barthes seems about as coldly unmoved by his students as they are to him. He doesn't throw them out of class, unless they bad-mouth each other, but just believes in remaining firm and asserting his position. After all, he can walk out after a month's work and never look back.His attitude is an efficient one, because he keeps many of his students in line. One wonders how the other unfortunate teachers in the building cope with their class. Mr. Barthes becomes increasingly acquainted with multiple females throughout his duties at this high school, one of the girls being an unfortunate, overweight soul named Meredith (Betty Kaye), the other a prostitute he meets one day on the bus named Erica (Sami Gayle).Throughout the film, we constantly see how detached from society Mr. Barthes is, and we question if it's inherent detachment of it he is trying to become attached but simply can't. Rather than providing answers to these problems, director Tony Kaye (of American History X fame) seems to be more intrigued in the way that these teachers cope with their impending personal lives and in their mentally destructive work lives.But one of Detachment's greatest success points, on me, personally, was the fact that it made me sympathize with teachers and give them a bit more credit than I usually do. The film showcases how the students they teach are clearly uninterested in their peers or their schoolwork in general, how persistent budget cuts from wealthy, ignorant politicians and their obsession with standardized test scores has lead them down a path of an almost incurable status, the fact that these teachers are almost as depressed and as hopeless as the students they teach, and their persistent self-esteem degradation by parents who feel they're not properly conducting their job. I should really climb out of my surburbia public school shell more often.Starring: Adrien Brody, Marcia Gay Harden, Christina Hendricks, William Petersen, Bryan Cranston, Tim Blake Nelson, Betty Kaye, Sami Gayle, Lucy Liu, Blythe Danner, and James Caan. Directed by: Tony Kaye.",Detachment
8,KineticSeoul,Altered realities of teenagers,9,1 October 2014,"I thought this movie was a glimpse into the past when I was in high school. As a matter of fact this is one of those movies, I wished I saw earlier in my life because it is impactful to a certain extent. And gave me a more in depth perspective of today's youth. What this film shows is the altered realities of teenagers in this present time and why they feel so detached. When you are in your teens your still in that learning phase in your life and part of it is the downfall of the environments in certain schools. Which can lead to coldness, super immaturity and being ungrateful for the effort that is given to you by others. I know, because I was actually one of those students. This film shows the heroic aspects of some teachers. Watching this movie now, at a time when I started to realized certain things on this journey called life. Makes movies like these more meaningful. This is a film that is most definitely worth a watch, especially for high school students. Adrien Brody's performance is superb and all the other cast members did a good job, including Lucy Liu. Overall, I thought this film could have done a bit more when it came to the student elements, but it did a good enough job to make a 9/10 in my opinion. Plus the caving in of the teachers was done right, maybe slightly exaggerated but I am no teacher myself. Perhaps if it stayed more true to the writer it just might have been better, but it's pointless to delve upon the what if.9/10",Detachment
9,inkblot11,A very sad but heartfelt film; Brody and the ensemble cast are terrific,8,16 June 2014,"Substitute teacher Henry (Adrien Brody) likes his job just fine. Emotionally scarred from a difficult childhood and still dealing with a sick, nursing home-dwelling grandfather, Hank wants as few attachments as possible. Hence, we know the meaning of the film's title. As a sub, he can't truly get to make long term connections with the students or faculty. Yet, he is quietly very good at his profession, gaining respect from his pupils and the district's personnel offices. Things can change. Henry decides to accept a sub position that will last a month, a detour from his routine. Sure enough, Henry wins the attention and admiration of most of his students, especially Meredith (Betty Kaye), who has a troubled home life despite being a promising art pupil. Also, there is an attractive fellow teacher (Christina Henricks) who shows an interest in the new guy. Finally, Henry encounters a teenage hooker-runaway on the subway, Erica (Sami Gayle) and decides to heal her surface wounds and keep her off the streets, at least temporarily. Now, Hank has a bunk mate, which develops into a tentative father-daughter relationship. Unhappily, Henry still suffers from destructive mental flashbacks and his sick dad. Will he truly let himself get out of his preferred state of detachment? This is a sad but powerful film about opening our hearts to good relationships in life and letting go of those that hurt us. Its tricky, yes. As the teacher who wants to shut down his emotions to avoid pain, Brody is excellent. Also fine are the great supporting players, Lucy Liu, Marcia Gay Harden, James Caan, Blythe Danner, Hendricks, Kaye, and Gayle. Gayle, especially, is terrific as the troubled runaway while Kaye, the director's daughter, is quietly heartbreaking, too. The setting on Long Island is bleak enough for the subject matter while the script, which could be called too heavy, makes its points nonetheless. Add on the excellent direction and you find a movie that is hard to forget. No, don't see it if you are having a miserable day yourself but make time for it when you can better handle a sad but richly rewarding tale of teens and the people that instruct them in life.",Detachment
10,cosmo_tiger,The most realistic movie I have seen about a teacher trying to help troubled students. Excellent and a must see. I say A+.,9,26 July 2012,"""Some of us believe we can make a difference, then we wake up and realize we failed."" Henry Barthes (Brody) is a substitute teacher who is all but dead inside. His grandfather is in a nursing home and close to death. He has no other family and the only job he can get is substitute teaching. After taking a position at a severely under preforming school he does everything he can to make a difference. Finding a way to connect to the kids is not only what they need, but also a way for him to find out who he is. There have been a ton of movies about a teacher who comes in to try and ""fix"" the students. Even including the true stories ""Dangerous Minds"" and ""Lean On Me"" this is easily the most realistic portrayal of a teacher trying to help I have ever seen. Not wanting to give anything away it's not a movie where he comes in and starts to rap and all of a sudden everyone gets A's, nor is it him coming in and being a hard ass until everyone ""gets it"". This is what most teachers would try and do I think and I didn't think it was possible but this movie give me more respect for what they go through on a day to day basis, most of which is unnoticed or unappreciated. This is a movie that you just need to see, and every high school kid who thinks he is a ""thug"" needs to see and understand. As well as parents who seem to not care about their kids education. Another movie that deserves to be noticed and seen by a bigger audience then it will get. I highly recommend this movie. I give this an A+.",Detachment
11,BeneCumb,Painfully realistic... and a-must-see for certain viewer groups,7,11 February 2013,"With the enhancement of freedoms and democracy, regulations were introduced to protect the so-called weaker strata, minorities etc. Unfortunately, there are several cases where the latter have abused / misused them, making trouble and creating discontent among the others. School is one of those micro-societies where some students go to the limit, but the adults (parents, teachers etc) are those imputed. Detachment gives a realistic overview of those issues, including different types of teachers and their views of life and the arisen situation.The cast is interesting: apart from Adrien Brody as Henry Barthes (really leading character, there are a few scenes without him), there are several action movie performers (e.g., James Caan, Tim Blake Nelson, Lucy Liu) depicting school personnel with serious issues. In general, all the cast is up to their task, there are no unreal types.This movie should be watched by teachers, parents, social workers, representatives of various protection organizations... Anyway, it is a strong movie, giving lots of food for thought.",Detachment
12,meeza,Classy movie!,8,20 January 2013,"I hope you do not detach yourself from my movie review of the drama ""Detachment"". But if you do, I punderstand I mean understand due to the numerous puns incorporated. ""Detachment"" stars Adrien Brody as Henry Barthes, a longtime substitute teacher who detaches himself from deep emotion due to a troubled past. Oh Henry! What could have happened? I will detach myself from revealing that because it does play a crucial factor in the film's narrative, and I do not want to spoil it for you. When he is transferred to another school, Henry's life begins to change due to the new people in his life. Henry befriends an attractive teacher colleague named Sarah Madison. A bullied female student named Meredith admires Henry due to his willingness to always help students in need. Henry also aids a young prostitute named Erica, and even allows her to stay in his place, with no sexual attachments required. Henry also constantly visits his ailing elderly grandfather. Henry is a good man. But when Meredith wants Henry to be a substitute of a father figure, and when Erica wants Henry to be a substitute of a lover figure, and when Grampa wants Henry to be a substitute of a savior figure, and when Ms. Madison falsely accuses Henry of being a substitute of a child molester figure, it puts Henry into a maximum stress level state. Director Tony Kaye, who also helmed ""American History X"", does more than an O Kaye job in presenting a story of a melancholy man trying to assist others while at the same time holding on to a dark past. Carl Lund's ""Detachment"" screenplay was a bit unorthodox but well-worded. Brody has not been this good in a starring role since his Oscar-winning turn in ""The Pianist"". Brody taught us a lesson that he can still act with his marvelous work as Henry! Yo Adrien, you did it! Christina Hendricks continues her rise to movie stardom with another well-rounded performance as Sarah Madison. Others in the supporting acting faculty that had passing grades included James Caan as veteran teacher Charles Seaboldt, Marcia Gay Harden as Principal Carol Dearden, Tim Blake Nelson as Mr. Wiatt, and Lucy Liu as Assistant Principal Dr. Doris Parker. Young actresses Sami Gayle who played Erica and Betty Kaye who played Meredith did show some promise with their performances, but still have to pass a few more tests to gain acting tenure. So my assignment for you is to go to your own personal homeroom and examine ""Detachment"". ****Good",Detachment
13,estebangonzalez10,Powerful and thought provoking film,8,5 August 2012,"¨A child's intelligent heart can fathom the depth of many dark places, but can it fathom the delicate moment of its own detachment? ¨ Detachment is a very interesting film although I wouldn't say it's entertaining. It raises a lot of questions and social issues without giving many answers, but it does make us aware of many problems that our society is facing when it comes to the educational system and parents lack of involvement in it. I thought Detachment was a beautiful film and despite it being a narrative it didn't seem like one; it is sort of poetic at times and has some great use of imagery. Adrian Brody is such a talented actor, and despite winning the Oscar for his brilliant work in The Pianist, I think he is very underrated in Hollywood. He is so good in this movie, and in my opinion it's his best performance since The Pianist. He was one of the reasons why I wanted to see this film; the other being that it was directed by Tony Kaye, the man responsible for American History X, which is on my list of favorite films. His films are powerful, thought provoking, and Detachment is not the exception. He can make memorable films although you wouldn't necessarily call them entertaining. In Detachment we are introduced to a very common problem: education. Kaye makes us wonder whether or not education is the teacher or parent's responsibility. Probably both, but unfortunately neither seem to be doing a great job and our society is losing its educational battle. Kids seem to find values somewhere else and base their self worth on what their friends think of them, meanwhile parents and teachers seem to do nothing about restoring their value. Parenting and teaching are great responsibilities, and as Brody says in one of his monologues in the movie there should be prerequisites to parenting and not anyone should be allowed too.Adrian Brody plays a substitute teacher, Mr. Barthes, who believes he has the perfect job because he doesn't have to carry the burden of identifying or carrying for his students. He can travel from one school to another. He is a lonely, quiet, and sad man who doesn't like attaching to anyone. He seems to have some disturbing memories about his past and doesn't like to talk about his problems so traveling from place to place is a good way to remain detached to society. His life will change when he gets his latest assignment at a very problematic school run by Principle Carol Dearden (Marcia Gay Harden). The students in this school give the teachers a very hard time and many of them seem to be going through a living hell. Mr. Barthes identifies with some of the teachers and students here. Mr. Seaboldt (James Caan), Ms. Madison (Christina Hendricks), Ms. Perkins (Blythe Danner), Mr. Wiatt (Tim Blake Nelson), and Dr. Doris Parker (Lucy Liu) are all part of the school faculty and all seem to be going through some sort of personal hardship. Mr. Barthes begins to identify himself with some of these people like Ms. Madison who seems as lonely as he is. He also begins to give special attention to one of his students named Meredith (Betty Kaye) who despite being talented doesn't really value herself. Another person who begins to influence Mr. Barthes is a young hooker named Erica (Sami Gayle) who he picks up from the street and begins to care for as a child. As much as Barthes wants to remain detached to people he begins to identify with many of them and without realizing it attaching to them.Detachment has a great cast. As I mentioned before this is Adrian Brody's best work since The Pianist, but I also have to give a lot of credit to young Sami Gayle who delivers a powerful performance as the lonely hooker who is taken advantage of and really has no self worth whatsoever. Director Kaye seems to raise this issue quite a bit since there are many characters who have little or no self value and in a way Brody's character tries to teach them that they have value and don't have to live based on the expectations or values given to them by others. James Caan and Christina Hendricks also give believable performances as part of the faculty. They are very different in character, but I think we all can identify them to some of the teachers we've had in the past. There are some very strong performances in this film and also some great dialogues. The script was written by first time screenwriter, Carl Lund, and it really is thought provoking. The imagery that Kaye uses is also very beautiful. There is a sense of claustrophobia as we see these long shots closing in on the school hallway, and emptiness when we see the abandoned classrooms. Detachment might not be an entertaining film you can watch with your friends, but it is a very interesting and thought provoking film.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",Detachment

16,saadgkhan,"An Excellent, eyes opening movie",9,5 July 2012,"Detachment – CATCH IT (A-) I think it was about time to have the movie about the teachers, and not like Cameron Diaz's Bad Teacher but a realistic approach to the teacher's problem facing the new generation. Who thinks they're bold, too smart for their own good or too bad to be cared. Detachment is a chronicle of three weeks in the lives of several high school teachers, administrators and students through the eyes of a substitute teacher named Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody). Barthes' method of imparting vital knowledge to his temporary students is interrupted by the arrival of three women in his life. His life gets more complicated when he takes in a teenage prostitute called Erica (Sami Gayle). I loved everything about Detachment, from script, to writing, direction, performances and most importantly the whole presentation. It's more like a documentary than a movie, which favored the movie considering its genre. Adrian Brody does a fantastic job as an actor and it won't be wrong to say that since the Pianist, that's her best performance till date. The performances by the supporting cast Sami Gayle, Aaron Sauter, James Caan, Christina Hendricks, Lucy Liu, Marcia Gay Harden, Bryan Cranston, William Petersen, Blythe Danner, Tim Blake Nelson and Betty Kaye is realistic and simply superb. I'll highly recommend this movie to everyone as it shows what new generation is turning into, though it doesn't give you the reason for social downfall but it defiantly opens your eyes.",Detachment
17,nathanmanson,I cried,8,19 November 2021,"Firstly Adrien Brody is actually too good of an actor, really enjoyable to watch him. I'm not a big fan of straight up dramas but I really enjoyed this. It's the highest rating I've given to a drama so that says a lot. The scene where them people took Erica away was so sad. That was the saddest scene of the film but when they were reunited it was the happiest moment of the film. Truly great film filled with deeper meanings and sad and heart felt scenes.",Detachment
18,rubenm,Depressing,6,19 May 2012,"Death, suicide, dementia, violence, abuse, neglect, indifference, decay, despair. These are just a few of the themes Detachment is about. No, this is not a happy movie. Every time you think you've reached the bottom, things get even worse. Neither is it an easy movie. Watching it requires a real effort. There is no relief, it's one depressing scene after another. The movie is about teacher Henry Barthes, who passively endures all the calamities that come his way. Not only does he have a very tough job, teaching indifferent and violent children in a school where all hope of improvement has been given up long ago, he also has to cope with his demented grandfather, and with a teenage prostitute he has encountered on the street and tries to help. The themes make this film a tough watching experience, but the form is equally difficult. The story is intertwined with flashes that seem to represent Henry's memories, with parts of a monologue in which Henry shares his despair with the viewer, and with animated blackboard drawings illustrating the other scenes. There are also parts with very nervous editing, and long shots of the school interior. Besides, the viewer has a hard time identifying with Henry. He doesn't seem to have any motives, any feelings or any ambition. 'It's all f****d up', he tells the audience. 'You try to make a difference, but you know you can't'. Henry is a very good teacher, but he doesn't seem to enjoy his work. Neither does he enjoy the inviting kiss from his pretty but lonely colleague, nor the gratitude from the teenager who gets back her dignity because of his care. Detachment can be seen on different levels. On one level, it's about the failure of the American educational system. On another, it's about an individual teacher and his frustrations. And on a third level, it's about the despair of humanity, of knowing that nothing ever will change because human beings are incapable of doing what they should do. A very depressing thought, but Detachment rubs it in very firmly.",Detachment
19,christophe92300,Dark,6,30 July 2013,"Tony Kaye draws up in this Detachment a dark portrait of a teacher's job and the US educational system, and delivers a striking but unfortunately not totally convincing movie.The film's interest lies mainly in Adrien Brody's totally nuanced and excellent performance as a troubled teacher on the verge of breaking point, within a very good cast perhaps a bit too under exploited.As for the script, it's not uninteresting, far from it, but the omnipresent darkness turns boring: after the hour mark, the viewer has enough of seeing all those depressed teachers and this completely depressing prevailing fatalism.The other big problem is the cinematography, a lot too stylized, clearly lacking coherence in its approach and ultimately turning out to be too messy, serving the story badly.",Detachment

21,AvidClimber,Detachment — Strange Simple Drama,9,25 November 2012,"Detachment starts in confusion. It's difficult to get a grip on the movie's MO at first. It has a documentary feel, yet it has acting which clashes strongly in the beginning because of the over strong feelings the characters go through of which we have no clue. The poetic/philosophic vibe seems out of place, the characters too sketchy, but eventually, a symphony emerge, and tragedy ensues.It is harsh, it is realistic, it is undiplomatic, but at the same time, carries strong moral values, basic ones, not made up religious nonsense. Excellent acting, good editing, nice soundtrack, and great visual. You'll love the characters, all of them, even flawed, by the end.Watch it, endure the rough beginning, it will all make sense, I promise.",Detachment
22,HelenMary,not easy watching but brilliant,7,7 April 2013,"Adrien Brody was superb in this hard-hitting, traumatic-watching drama about a substitute teacher with high ideals and standards but fighting against personal demons in his past, difficulties in his every day life and working at a school where the children run amok and the teachers are brow-beaten and broken specimens of pedagogy. Mr Barthes (Brody) is a brilliant and inspiring teacher and a moral man, but struggling. There are powerful performances by a glittering ensemble cast; with honourable mention going to Lucy Liu, James Caan and the newly introduced Sami Gayle as young prostitute Erica. Also well acted was Betty Kaye as troubled Meredith, student in Mr Bathes class.This is a stylised documentary-esque film... Brody is interviewed ""in character"" throughout the film and the film is illustrated by chalk on blackboard diagrams and the artwork of Meredith. It doesn't flow as a story/film given the artiness of it, but that adds to the drama and tension of the film and you are left feeling rather frayed at the end. Nothing in the film is ""nice"" and an easy-watch and you are constantly worried what the next revelation will be, but in it is still a gripping and inspirational piece of cinema; the importance of good parenting and the skill and importance of good teachers are highlights. Brody's Mr Bathes is such an inspirational teacher... and you wish there are more like him.",Detachment
23,krachtm,Good but a little pretentious,8,11 November 2012,"The plot: a substitute teacher, unwilling to make any permanent attachments in his life, slowly comes to care for his students and community.This is the sort of insightful, thoughtful movie that we should encourage Hollywood to make (instead of endless horror movie remakes and comic book reboots). While not nearly as pretentious and shallow as your stereotypical Oscar-bait, it still struck me as being a bit self-important, like it was imparting Great Truths about the human condition. Come on. It was good, but I doubt that it's going to change anyone's life.I really enjoyed the gritty realism. I like movies with dark themes that aren't afraid to explore the darker aspects of human nature, such as Taxi Driver and Night of the Living Dead. Unlike those movies, however, redemption does seem to be a possibility in Detachment. Thus, it falls into what I might call a very thematically dark, inspirational story. If you're looking for something light-hearted and warm, it's best you avoid this. I'm sure you'll find it too emotionally draining.",Detachment

And I've seen myself a few of 'em.A stunning collection of acclaimed acting talent including Adrien Brody, Marcia Gay Harden, James Caan, Blythe Danner and William Peterson are uniformly wasted in this miserable mess. And that's damn hard to accomplish. It's as if the whole lot of 'em were somehow convinced to participate by Director Tony Kaye with a patronizing pitch along the lines of, ""Hey. Let's all make an overly dramatic statement movie that sledgehammers the audience repeatedly over the skull about how the American public education system is egregiously failing our kids. And then, for good measure, we'll toss in some shots at the rotten state of Long Term Elderly Care Facilities while we're at it. Come on. It'll be awesome."" The resultant refuse is about as ""detached"" from ""awesome"" as one can possibly conjure.There is certainly a high-caliber film to be made that draws desperately needed attention to the authentic and alarming issues raised in ""Detachment"". And despite apparent earnest efforts, this dispiriting debacle leaves us still wanting.",Detachment
25,Chris_Pandolfi,Desperation and Despondency as a Wakeup Call,9,23 March 2012,"I had no idea how ill prepared I was to experience ""Detachment."" Here is a film that plunges headfirst into the depths of disillusionment, despair, and failure and almost never resurfaces for air. You will experience emotions normally repressed during movie watching. You will be saddened, shocked, and above all, angered. You will see things you wouldn't ever want to see and hear things that should never be heard. You will wade through a sea of bleakness, desperately searching for some small shred of hope to cling on to. At the end of it all, you will be so psychologically drained that, for a time, it may seem as if you will never be happy again. At the same time, you will also get to thinking, and that's exactly why I'm recommending this movie so highly.A few months ago, I snubbed my nose at the critically acclaimed thriller ""The Grey,"" an equally hopeless and depressing but also nihilistic story about men who must fight against wolves, and themselves, in the snowy Alaskan wilderness. Unlike that film, which reduced its compelling ideas into a cheap and shallow thriller, ""Detachment"" uses its desperation and despondency to make a point. I don't see it as a movie so much as a wakeup call, a way for audiences to understand not just the world but themselves as well. At its essence, it's an examination of behaviors that are perpetuated by people that have the power to stop it. It might not seem like they have the power. In fact, it might seem like absolutely everything is working against them. There's no question that rising above adversity is a challenge. Nevertheless, it's one that must be faced.The main setting is an inner city public high school, one that exemplifies with horrifying detail the failure of the No Child Left Behind act of 2001. Most of the students are poorly educated, violent, and foulmouthed. They have no respect for others, but more to the point, they have no respect for themselves. They have, in fact, degenerated into pure apathy. This has rubbed off on the faculty, for they know that all their years of teaching and guidance haven't made the slightest difference. They're constantly berated by furious parents for being so lousy at their jobs. It's almost as if they have relinquished themselves of the responsibility of actually raising their own children. Is your son or daughter a problem? Don't take the necessary steps of working towards a solution – simply dump them off at school and let the teachers do the dirty work.Bearing witness to all of this is a substitute teacher Henry Barthes (Adrien Brody). He struggles to make a difference, all the while knowing that he's failing miserably. He sees nothing but people who have given up, and he's within of inch of giving up on himself. His personal life is a mess; his grandfather (Louis Zorich), in the advances states of some kind of dementia, languishes in a nursing home staffed by people who simply don't care. He has flashbacks of a childhood scarred by the absence of a father, an alcoholic mother, and a deep tragedy. He eventually takes in an underage prostitute named Erica (Sami Gayle). He's saddened by her situation and even helps her in a few important regards, but he doesn't coddle her like a frightened puppy. He wants to get through to her that she has value as a person, that she's so much better than giving oral sex to men on the bus. He's also tortured by the fact that their arrangement can't last forever.Several distinguished actors make appearances in this film, mostly as faculty members. These would include Marcia Gay Harden, Tim Blake Nelson, James Caan, Lucy Liu, Blythe Danner, Christina Hendricks, Isiah Whitlock, Jr., Bryan Cranston, and William Petersen. All are in various stages of professional and personal breakdown; Nelson plays a teacher who isn't noticed by anyone, Caan plays an administrator who can only get through the day on medication and biting wit, and Harden plays a woman who knows that the end is near. In one of the best scenes, Liu lashes out at a student for her disrespect and indifference at her own future. She gets nothing but kids like this day in and day out. What is the point of pointing out their academic shortcomings when they obviously won't take the steps to better themselves?Of all the actors that appeared in the film, the most compelling is Betty Kaye as a student named Meredith, who observes the school through the lens of her camera. She creates dark collages with her photos. Her creativity is labeled by her unseen but clearly heard father as unnecessary teen angst. Believing only beautiful people are worthy of attention, he cruelly harps on her about her overeating, the way she dresses, and her social isolation. Meredith, an intelligent young woman, makes a connection with Barthes. Unfortunately, her self-esteem is so low that she misinterprets his encouragement as personal affection.The film intercuts linear scenes with multiple narrative techniques, none more resonant than Barthes' documentary-style confessionals. The final scene begins with him reading the opening sentences from Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher,"" which should already tell you everything you need to know. The message of ""Detachment"" is simply one of responsibility and caring. If you're a parent, nurture your children and allow them to be themselves. Don't expect a school system to raise them for you – as they say, education begins at home. Before you point out someone else's flaws, first recognize your own. Understand that you're not perfect. Be thoughtful of others. And above all, know that you matter. There is no tragedy deeper than giving up on yourself.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Detachment

29,digdog-785-717538,Nice but not very meaningful,6,25 February 2012,"Detachment .. i went in with a single great expectation, to watch Adrian Brody excel, and i was not disappointed; But yet, Detachements falls a few steps short of magnificence, focusing too much on the actor and too little on the writing.Brody is a substitute teacher, new in your ""worst nightmare"" school, where he tells others and himself he just wants to get to the end of the day, but he's really a man with a lot of determination and he's trying to help the kids who ""can't be helped"".There are two parallel stories in Detachments: his school work, and the story of a young street girl he meets and tries to help. My problem with this film is that both stories fail to soar - you have on one hand the chubby girl whose character screams ""suicide"" from her first scene, and the young hooker, who gets killed off (i.e. sent away to social services, ""exit stage left"") as soon as the relationship with the main character becomes ambiguous. In a similar way, all minor characters get turned over as soon as they try to make an impact in the story.I agree it's a dramatic film, but it tries to be too far-reaching and just self-destroys in the end. There is no moral, no story, no hope of salvation.Awesome Brody, but nothing else i haven't seen before.My vote : 6/10 - nice, but not that meaningful",Detachment

It was complex in a warm way, has its own way to put that so much feeling in this 1 and half hour movie.The story it self was quite easy to take, so it become great balance to help our phase to understand the 'whole' movie.",Detachment
31,dschmeding,You are in for a world of hurt,9,26 February 2012,"Wow! I was not expecting this movie to be this engaging. Its one of those films that leave you sitting in silence for a while when the credits roll much like excellent Dramas like ""Requiem for a dream"" or ""Downloading Nancy"".This one spells it out pretty clear with the line ""Henry Barthes is all of us""... its hard to grasp how the realization that we are indeed all the same can be so painful.On the surface ""Detachment"" deals with the crumbling American education system through the eyes of substitute teacher Henry Barthes (played by Adrian Brody) who starts a new assignment in a new school with new teachers, in a new class with new pupils like he is obviously used to.The beginning shows him trying to get into this new class around the bullies threatening him and other pupils, making it hard to teach anything. At first it looks like all those ""good teacher turns around a bad class"" movies but its not. You soon realize that the school is just the backdrop for a larger story about a teacher who tries to do his job by taking a role outside the play. Barthes makes clear that he is hollow and words can't hurt him which is his way of coping with a hopeless situation by neglecting his private life and detaching from the world. Like him every teacher seems to have developed his individual coping mechanism. For some its cynicism and dark humor, ""happy pills"" are regularly mentioned too and for others its just swallowing their emotions until they erupt. You see the teachers coping with their daily routine while hearing an answering machine in the background every now and then with other teachers resigning or parents shouting for better grades for their kids.Its pretty tough stuff seeing kids void of hope, interest or enthusiasm and teachers trying to get to the few who are still to be reached in the classroom. But its here where it all falls apart because of hollow politics, parents that do not care or are just as dysfunctional as the kids they raised and dropped into the public education system and idiotic social rules and conventions we are all used to. When you see the pattern in all the peoples private lives and their desperate tries of holding on its obvious that ""Detachment"" is not just about the public school system but about our whole society, about each and every one of us.When Barthes meets a young street hooker he decides to take her in with him and do his job outside school. Its quite heartbreaking to see him trying to make a change against all odds. At times Barthes comes across like a modern day Jesus when he sleeps on the floor of his small apartment and lets the girl sleep in bed. Some might say that ""Detachment"" is too light on the teachers because most of the blame falls onto parents and politicians. There is hardly an unsympathetic teacher in this movie. Yet there are scenes that show Barthes is no Jesus at all... like when he violently shouts at a nurse in a retirement home after an incident with his dying grandfather. Barthes is indeed like all of us, cracking when he struggles to cope and lashing out to get out the pressure, just like the parents at school push their pressure to the teachers.And this is where the detachment cracks... amidst all the failures Barthes manages to connect to the girl, as well as to an outcast girl at school. And he connects through emotion and personal attachment but soon has to realize that it does not work. The scenes of him sending away the girl to a foster home when he tells her he cannot be her family or when he has do send away the outcast girl when she tries to share her sorrow with him are gut-wrenching. There are so many honest and deeply emotional scenes in this movie its hard to keep track. His grandfathers death with his total forgiving, Barthes monologues trying to make the pupils understand why they need basic education for their own sake are as brilliant as Lucy Lius Characters breakdown in which she shouts out her desperation and sadness towards a seemingly not caring girl.The relationship between Barthes and the girl is stunning and constantly rocked by misunderstandings... plain because you don't expect it to be non-sexual with all the pedophile stories, sexual harassment laws and stereotypes. But against all odds it is and you realize that when there are no parents (like in the haunting ""parents night"" scenes with teachers waiting and no one coming) someone else must fill this void... how empty have we become that we cannot expect someone to help out of honest interest for his fellow man... or rather child?!""Detachment"" is a bleak and painful movie but it has some hope and even some humor (the cynic teachers way of teaching a girl about the dangers of STD with a picture of a rainbow and a picture of a disease ridden vagina is one of those much needed lighter moments).Its like when Barthes says in one of his many off commentaries... life is an ocean of chaos and the realization that you are the one supposed to throw the buoy while struggling to stay afloat is devastating. But its the honesty about his own struggle that makes him connect with others. Its when they realize we indeed are all the same, all struggling and they are not alone in their strife that gives them their humanity. But thats what life is... so what can you do but be honest and hope for the best.... Its all going to be OK!",Detachment
32,perkypops,How do you rate a film like this?,10,17 March 2013,"The most notable feature of this film is its flawed attempt to look at dealing with life by being aware of self. And it is flawed only because the self is flawed. The stylish art of director Tony Kaye is a simple but effective way to put into pictures what is a battle between a flawed but almost true to himself teacher Henry Barthes (Brody) and the contacts he must make each and every day all designed to test, challenge and dismantle his comfort zone. In one sense Barthes doesn't seek connection but he gets it just the same because every less flawed self is attracted by another more flawed self in the act of levelling.Barthes challenge is in the classroom, in an unlikely friendship with Erica (beautifully played by Sami Gayle), in a possible romance, in his father's hospital room, and in the edges around all of this. Because of the way the film is edited the feeling of chaos is sometimes very edgy, almost as if we have been watching out of sequence. But the result is amazingly satisfying as we go through the pain of almost every character as if it were our own pain. And if we take a moment to reflect it is our own pain.The sound track is understated and yet lingers. The cinematography is stylish throughout. The script is provocative and insightful and we are left with a feeling that no matter how permanent a situation may appear it is always temporary although there is always something that lingers.A film against which all others should be judged because it attempts to tell a truth.",Detachment

34,lucasversantvoort,"Powerful, yet overwrought",6,6 May 2015,"To sum up what Depressi- I mean Detachment is like, just realize this is a grand social critique by the man who directed American History X. This leads me to only one way to describe Detachment: its heart is in the right place and it has some compelling drama going for it, but it's too over the top to present its social critique in a completely convincing manner. In a way, the same problems that plagued American History X now plague this film.Our main character is a substitute teacher named Henry Barthes, played by Adrien Brody whose face has a melancholy quality that makes him a natural fit for this film. In addition to merely teaching what the school wants him to teach, he actively tries to engage the students on an emotional and ethical level, to teach them things about life and so on. He goes on about the corrupting influence of the media and how the students must learn to think for themselves, etc. You'd think that would be enough to fill one film, but we also get a prostitute Henry pick up off the streets and tries to take care. There's also Henry's dying grandfather who lives in a nursing home and various employees at the school with problems of their own. The film thus tries to paint an enormous critique of the high school system through various characters.What the film has going for it, are the same things American History X had going for it: great acting and drama. Adrien Brody and the rest of the cast are all quite great, particularly Brody. The film is at its preachy best during the classroom scenes where Henry outlines several societal critiques in his bid to truly educate his students in his short time there. Several other scenes, including one where Henry verbally lashes one of the nursing home's employees for not taking care of his grandfather's needs, also have a great sense of drama and whether or not you'll like/love/hate the film, there is no doubt that watching Detachment is an impactful, intense experience.The thing that really hurts this film, however, is the same thing that hurt American History X: over the top melodrama (complete with slow-motion). As the film goes on, the film becomes increasingly melodramatic to the point that it becomes detrimental to the messages the film intends to spread. When an important, tragic character dies at the end, it feels too much as if the film – like American History X – suffers from It's Not A Good Story, Unless Someone Dies syndrome and that's not what you want. You want the death to feel deserved, which I feel this film did not. Also detrimental are the amount of well-known actors in this film. This is one of those cases where the amount of stars don't mix with the type of film. An art-house film featuring a star-studded cast hurts its aims for 'realism'.In the end it's easy to see this film has its heart in the right place. One can sense the anger behind all the social critique delivered in its scenes. Yet it is director Tony Kaye's overwrought sense of drama that makes the film devolve into an ever increasing spiral of sadness and darkness which makes it hard to deliver the Big Message without alienating the audience. Too much melodrama can turn off an audience and that's what happened for me. The film started off incredibly well, featuring lots of well-delivered social critique, but by the end – especially when (spoiler) the overweight girl died – the film became too dark and cliché-ridden. There was no light at the end of the tunnel, no subplots that ended well. Now, this is of course in line with the aims of the film, but how can I stay open to its messages when all it gives me is a nonstop portrayal of a society trapped in a downward spiral, regardless of the truths the film contains?",Detachment
35,dharmendrasingh,'Some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal',9,26 August 2012,"Tony Kaye, the elusive director of the hard-hitting 'American History X', directs a glittering all-star cast in this existential tour de force. 'Detachment' may have been released a few months short of Oscar season, and given a limited run, but nominations for best director, best lead actor (Adrien Brody) and best original screenplay (first-timer Carl Lund) are the very least this five-star film deserves. Adrien Brody, a great actor despite many dubious roles, delivers his finest performance since 2002's 'The Pianist'. Here he plays Henry Barthes, a substitute teacher whose back-story is more tumultuous than those of the inner-city kids he teaches. Their problems are self-evident. They come from broken homes, are largely ethnic, indigent and have few opportunities to escape their genetic misfortune. Henry's neglect began as young boy when his father left home, causing his mother to fatally overdose, leaving him to care for his Alzheimer's-stricken grandfather. Kaye brilliantly manages to develop a long list of peripheral characters whilst never removing the focus from Henry. Marcia Gay Harden's principal knows she heads a failed school, but forlornly clings on despite her impending extinction. Lucy Liu, the school shrink, reveals in a violent outburst that she is more vulnerable than the kids. James Caan (outstanding in his supporting role) consoles her, as he plays the only teacher who seems to be able to cope, though only with the aid of happy pills. He relates to the students by coming down to their level, which is a very low level indeed. Christina Hendricks, Tim Blake Nelson and William Peterson fill in as other teachers; the sort who would have said they came into this hellhole to 'make a difference'. The story pays homage to 'Taxi Driver' when Henry befriends underage prostitute, Erica (Sami Gayle in her film debut). At first he has no intention of sheltering her, and is content to allow her to continue prostituting herself. But just as Iris was De Niro's saviour in the other film, Erica unwittingly becomes Henry's saviour. Drawing inspiration from existentialist novelist Albert Camus, the other key character in this story is Meredith (Tony Kaye's daughter, Betty). She plays Henry's only capable student, but has serious self-confidence issues because she is overweight and – the film's recurring theme – has wretched parents. Henry reassures her with his philosophical insights, but her confidence is crushed when he refuses to embrace her, causing a tragic and irreversible conclusion. I appreciate this film because it courageously illuminates a dark side of life. It drew me in and blew me away. It has so much heart and emotional integrity that I sat in the back row, quietly sobbing my eyes out as I remembered related events in my own life. www.moseleyb13.com",Detachment
36,tbmforclasstsar,a powerful and moving tale of a substitute teacher and the intersecting lives in a high school,9,8 March 2012,"Tony Kaye is not known for having happy-go-lucky tales that leave you feeling better about the status of our world. Even in light and glorious colored shots, Kaye tells stories with deeper inner conflict and demanding commentary about our society. His most famous work, ""American History X"" (a project that he famously wanted his name taken off of after being upset by edits star Edward Norton made to the film), was a film that showed these dark struggles and issues in a film about a neo- nazi group and their attitude towards the world.In his new film, ""Detachment"" (a film he has kept his name on), Kaye and first time writer Carl Lund tell the story of a substitute teacher who travels from school to school trying his best to help the lives of his students, his own life, and the community he is in. The substitute is Henry Barthes, played by Adrien Brody, who is a man that has his own inner struggles and past conflicts that he fights with day-to-day. But Henry must try to put these issues aside when he enters the classroom at this school; a school at which the students don't care, the teachers struggle to educate, and everyone takes a toll from the experiences.What Lund does so brilliantly in his writing is creating a story that doesn't give one perspective of the situation. He tells the story through the eyes of Henry, the students, the parents, and even a young prostitute Henry befriends. In fact, even as Henry is the main character of this story, we still get perspective from many of the other teachers (played by James Caan, Tim Blake Nelson, Christina Hendricks, Blythe Danner, Lucy Liu, and Marcia Gay Harden). The student stories range from a young girl who struggles with weight problems, parents pressuring her, and bullying to students who act tough and thug and threaten harm to the teachers. What results from this is a multi-faceted story that gives many perspectives and tales. Like ""The Wire"" inside a high school.As the tale moves along, we get to know each of these characters deeply and care for them a great deal. From the relationship that forms between Henry and the young prostitute named Erica to the conversations between teachers discussing how they could be better, the film places us within this harsh world of a school and asks us what can be done about bettering our youth, bettering our communities, and bettering ourselves.The film also touches briefly and comments on the outside factors that affect day-to-day school life. From advertisements and social norms telling us how we should act and who we should be to apathetic parenting that leads to a Parent Night with almost no attendees, Kaye and Lund construct a film that demands us to want more, shows us some of the factors that lead to these problems, and confesses there are no easy answers. As Henry begs his students to think for themselves and care for something more than just them, Kaye and Lund bring in the outer conflicts that impact these kids and cause the inability for them to think this way. This is no easy road with a simple answer. It is complex with many different intersecting avenues.Outside of the strong construction of the story by Lund and the beautiful cinematography and strong directing from Kaye, this film also benefits deeply from the acting performances, specifically from Adrien Brody. While Caan, Nelson, Hendricks, Danner, Liu, Harden, and newcomers Sami Gayle (Erica) and Tony's daughter Betty Kaye (the bullied Meredith) are all brilliant, Brody is absolutely enthralling. While Brody's career has not blown up since his Best Actor Oscar for ""The Pianist"" (a few Wes Anderson films, ""The Brothers Bloom,"" ""King Kong,"" ""The Village,"" ""Hollywoodland,"" and ""Splice"" on the short and not extremely noteworthy list), he is so powerful and strong in ""Detachment."" With the ability to say so much with so little and controlling every scene he is in, Brody reminds us why he is an Academy Award winner while making us laugh and cry with him throughout this film.""Detachment"" is an extremely effective and emotional tale that will both warm and break your heart. The story lines of the film intersect and converge like a graceful car crash. The pain of one interaction morphs into the joy of a different one. Haunting memories of the past bring up pain in the present. With careful construction of the world of this school, along with Kaye's masterful direction and photography and some brilliant thespianism by Brody and the rest of the cast, ""Detachment"" is a film that can impact a person in so many ways. Just as Henry tries to have an influence on all the lives he meets in the short period he substitutes, so does Kaye educate and ask questions to his audience and demand that we think a little more about ourselves, those around us, and the community we are all a part of. That we must not stay detached, but become an important and productive member for ourselves and everyone around us.Read more Film reviews and more at CustodianFilmCritic.com",Detachment

92% of google users liked this movie.I think this movie is a work of art that most people will pass on and even those that watch it may not understand the intricate complexities of the beautiful and poetic writing, including myself. I am not capable of analyzing this story.Watched it for a 2nd time just now. I am a fan of Adrien Brody and that is why I checked it out.This movie was/is extremely depressing from start to finish. Actually, it was overly depressing.The story is depicted in an extremely over-the-top depressing manner. Surely Adrien Brody was chosen for this 2011 movie role due to his performance on The Pianist (2002). I liked that the movie not only focuses on exploring the protagonist, but also shows glimpses of the troubles teachers go through, as well as glimpses of the troubles some teenage students have.There are many themes in this film and many possible interpretations and topics of discussion that I am incapable of putting into writing. My review certainly does not do this movie justice. I do not think I have the capability to give this movie the kind of review it deserves; maybe a really knowledgeable English professor could?The protagonist - Adrien Brody - depicts the saddest man in the world, who is also kind, and one must wait very patiently to find out why he is so sad. One answer is provided and it seems to suffice to answer this question. The two things he witnessed (?) in his life would forever traumatize anybody. This answer in the plot later made me question whether this story is based on a true story. The two things he witnessed (?) are fully plausible and surely have happened in real life countless times everywhere.Sami Gayle - the second protagonist - I think she did really well, especially her crying scene - it was heartbreaking. Very happy with her performance.James Caan - grandpa - I think he did good with his role. He was very believable.Christina Hendricks - she is a bombshell and yet her acting was very flat and overall very poor and immediately forgettable. Very disappointing.The rest of the supporting cast were decent (including Bryan Cranston) and immediately forgettable.Conclusion: this is a complex movie with hidden themes that are difficult to put into words. I feel this movie is a lot more complicated than meets the eye. It is definitely not most people's cup of tea. But those that not only decide to give this movie a shot and actually stick around until the very end, may be rewarded with some fulfillment.8/10",Detachment
39,he88,Maybe A Bit Too Dark And Gloomy,7,24 January 2013,"I recently saw this and like many others I had to wonder if inner city schools have become this dark and gloomy. I'm sure that a lot of the parental apathy and sometimes over all anger that occurs when the school is forced to deal with a student who has been disruptive is probably real. I just have a hard time believing that any school could deteriorate as bad as this unless of course the parents have basically thrown in the towel too as the movie suggests.Every so often the movie industry seems to come out with a movie like this that basically shows the deterioration of the inner city school system. Blackboard Jungle was one of the earliest I can remember and the message about the problems of the inner city schools and how that effects the students wasn't much different than this movie over all. Since then there's been many other films basically pointing out the same thing....""Poor kids from inner city school systems have little chance of getting an education because it's a jungle out there....An by the way....If you're looking for help for the inner city schools...Write Santa...It'll get you about as far"" By now we get it. The situation is dire and getting worse. We no longer need educated factory workers so the powers that be have all but shut down inner city schools because they think it's a wasted effort. To me...That's where the story really needs to go. Stories like this is only the end result of what's being done to the inner city by the movers and shakers. We know the results, what is needed is a movie showing the cause. Otherwise we'll just have more future movies showing kids in America living like they're in third world countries with basically no place to go to school anymore.The movie is well acted with really good performers. I must say that as a fan of the show ""Blue Bloods"" I was really surprised to see the young actress who plays a very straight laced mature teen in that play a teen street hooker in this one. After only seeing her in that other character it was really strange to see her get street smart tough in this when we first see her. What was pretty cool though was the relationship between her and the teacher (Not a sexual nature) was a metaphor for what could be in regards to the school situation. At first it just looked like one bit of happiness in an otherwise gloomy movie, but then I realized it pretty much summed up what was happening on not happening between the teachers, students, and parents that brought the situation to where it was now......I would have given the movie a ten, but I have a hard time giving such a high score to a movie that leaves me a bit depressed by the time it's over.",Detachment
40,AlbertCinefilu,A movie packed with GOLDEN life lessons,9,16 January 2021,"Even if story-wise the movie is just good, it is incredibly effective regarding its ability to tell us about how we should live our lives as best as we can. Because it certainly doesn't luck truth, something that many movie directors don't really think that much about but Tony Kaye and Carl Lund put emphasis on.I really appreciated his performance in The Pianist, but with this movie Adrien Brody has proved himself worthy of being one of my favorite actors. The frequent close-ups and extreme close-ups also helped much in establishing connection with his character, Henry, and I can't say I wasn't satisfied with the rest of the cast, though I reckon I'd have wanted a better closure for some of the characters who just walked out of the door in the last part of the movie. Perhaps their sudden ''detachment'' from the narrative was a justified parallel to the main character's struggle but still, it could have been done a tad better.
Otherwise, no complaint.A 9 out 10 from me.",Detachment

I knew absolutely noting about that this film apart from the director gave us one of the best movies ever made in American History X.I've seen some amazing films this year, Ill Manors, Café Flore & Shame but this is by far the best of the lot.There's no need to tell you what the film is about as everyone else has already done that. But what I can say is anyone with a soul, depth & compassion will relate this movie on so many levels. (I was constantly wiping away the tears from my face)You're gripped from the opening scene in which you feel like you're having a one on one conversation with the brilliant Adrien Brody. It's incredibly intimate and touching.This is by no means a film on depression but does touch upon the struggles of day to day life in all forms of society, with the subtext being it's going to be alright. There's a light at the end of all the tunnel, keep going and your light will shine. I've lost friends to suicide and heroin and wish both of these amazing people shared that optimism.The cast is fantastic and brilliantly acted. (Why wasn't Brody nominated for an Oscar?) The chemistry between Brody and the beautiful Erica played by a newbie who will surely be around for years to come is superb, in fact, it reminded me of the relationship between Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murrey in Lost in Translation.The film is broken up with dreamy visions of Brody as a boy, and chalk board animations. These enhanced the film emotionally.Few films can touch you deeply and stay with you but this does.In the words of Matt Johnson from The TheIf you can't change the world, then change yourself, if you can't change yourself, then change your world.",Detachment

Clearly showing on all sides that which is not understood from differing factions. Adrian Brody is yet again, excellent and really is an underrated actor. This is the 2nd film of his I have seen this month and in both (Manhattan Night) he captures the mood better than any other actor I can think of.

45,Stewball,A Masterpiece,10,19 April 2012,"I saw this originally in a theater and then again on VOD. I loved it right off and rated it a 9, but it was a movie I just couldn't get off my mind. The cast was outstanding, especially Brody, and the one that kept bringing my thoughts back to it, Toni Gayle as Erica in her first feature film performance. As the director Tony Kaye said, hers was the first character he cast because she is the central pin for the story--amazing given a cast loaded with familiar faces and names and incredible talent.I can't say too much about the story without spoiling it. It does have memorable dialogue, a very interesting story, and humor is not absent but I think is suffers with audiences because the central character, Brody, is a deep person with a lot to offer but is stuck in a sad, shallow outward personality. If I'd had to leave before the end, I might well not have gone back to finish it. Others have watched it thinking it was going to be another ""American History X"", but they're just two different movies, both with something big to say, this more so even than X in my opinion. My only minuscule nit to pick is I'd rather have had Brody do the head shots as voice over narration. Above all, if I didn't say anything else I'd say this....stick with it.The only flaw associated with this movie given all is positives is criminally atrocious marketing. It's like displaying Van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" in the basement of the Museum of Modern Art where only the occasional patron wanders in and happens to lift its covering.

""Detachment"" is an absolutely wonderful movie that navigates the incomprehensible world of dysfunctional lives, focusing on lost children and their inner struggles to survive. Brody is fantastic as a teacher who tries to understand his students through his own suffering.

Except when you talk about human kind in a very broad sense or about a certain group you belong to. It annoyed me to bits..because he didn't change that perspective throughout the movie into something more specific , something more complex. something with real substance instead of the quasi philosophical melancholy. He kept it broad and generic. The movie tried to be too much, in brief contact with characters that just disappear..in the end it just felt vague, and the girl from the street is the one I felt the most..The teacher kept being this cliché semi- sad dude that was passive with some 'activity' in between..but most of all passive and talking about how 'we' do everything wrong etc.",Detachment

49,bonzybino,ubiquitous assimilation!!,7,29 February 2012,"Detachment is a dark movie which everyone can relate with, the solitariness, the cynicism, the despair and the darker shades of our lives which we cover with many other things. It doesn't end on a good note unlike the common genre movies - it could have easily drifted that way to be more appealing. But then who's gonna live happily forever!!Though the education system and the schools and the students ain't that evil and rotten the way its shown in the movie, it does pose many a question, the dubious system in which everything goes on without a point. The miserable life of teachers were beautifully shown, yes they do go through worse situations. Adrien Brody does something meaty after pianist as the cool, composed and ailing substitute teacher. The climax was so dramatic and metaphorical, the background score adds value to the visual richness.The screenplay is too dark at times, the lighter moments and the virtuous elements highly underplayed though it saves the movie many a time from drowning. I loved the way the narration takes us through, we feel the pain the characters are going through.

So yes, it's a ""teachers' film"", but the rest of us can learn from it too. Brody is the supply teacher thrown into a chaotic, hostile inner city school where the kids are menacing with tons of attitude and no apparent interest in learning anything. He's only there for a few weeks, so could easily do the minimum, pick up his paycheck and clear out, but he cares about these kids. A local hooker takes a shine to him and he tries the same tough love with her, but she's so damaged that she clings like a limpet to anyone who shows her the smallest kindness. (Reminded me a bit of 'Five Easy Pieces', where Jack NIcholson gets the same treatment, despite being a hopeless drifter.) Slightly melodramatic conclusion with another damaged kid who gets too close to him for comfort, but basically a powerful, involving and depressingly credible account of the modern classroom. P.S.

52,twotrybe,Hopefully. people will see this with Vide On Demand,9,20 March 2015,"I became curious about this film because I read where this film was Same Gayle's feature debut. I didn't know anything about this person other than her role on Blue Blood and that show limits her acting strength after seeing Detachment. Here was a film that Tony Kaye directed with an understatement that disguises the powerful argument for sterilization. The students have dissolved into disrespectful future parole violators and the parents, some of them, are the source of these problem children. And trying to ride that ship in turbulent waters in the Adrian Brody character. His attempts to settle those waters is a force of nature one man cannot do alone. But I don't know if he calms those waters following a tragedy or if all hell hits the place and that was a dream? I don't know how old Sami Gayle was when this role was filmed but her corrupt innocence is washed over as an abused prostitute. Her first time encounter with the Adrian Brody character isn't Pretty Woman, a film I hated for it's depiction of the happily ever after prostitute. Sami Gayle's prostitute had more realism to it. The only misgivings I had was that the audience never got to know the results from her medical test. Perhaps it was edited out for time. And the teachers were excellent. I saw where Adrian Brody was the producer for this project. He pulled some top notched actors that made this work. James Caan , Lucy Lui, Marsha Gay Harden, Christine Hendricks, the other guy who held on to the chain link fence, all were good. And while watching this, you had the feeling that some student might go off on the deep end and that was predictable and not unexpected but it was done with the right tempo and uniqueness, no gun play.And I saw where it didn't do well at the box office. Well, with video on demand, I hope this avenue will work out for them so that more eyes can watch this exceptionally independent film.",Detachment

54,dbrayshaw,Education without virtue,10,25 November 2014,"What struck me as very odd, as not in keeping with the inner madness and dysfunction of the characters, was that the school was clean, the lockers shined and the hallways clear of graffiti. One would expect an unkempt facility would be another sign of the inward struggles going on in everyone's life. That is usually the outcome of schools in failure. is it not? The House of Usher was the exact metaphor for that school, the outward sign of inward decay. But what would have been able to fix it? A handful of teachers? In my opinion, the absence of God throughout the characters' lines, and the lack of respect for Him, which is the present preoccupation and intent of today's administrations, led this particular school to decline.Education and knowledge will never be enough when it is not mixed with virtue, and what this movie shows is the price of such an environment, which, I think, speaks for most of American educational institutions. There are no absolutes being taught. Everything is up for grabs. Kids are being told to decide life as they see it. Anything you want to believe is okay. But, if we don't teach our kids to accept the most stable spiritual foundation, the Judeo-Christian belief system, we'll continue to get what is represented in this film, a mass of people wondering just what is worth believing, what stabilizes.

While I wasn't disappointed to have seen it, I have to say it came across more than a little heavy-handed. I'll tell it to you now, without spoiling the movie: the message is we're ruining our civilization by not raising our kids properly. So, if you want to sit through an hour and a half of bleakness to be spoon-fed that fairly obvious concept, there are worse ways to do it than to watch this film. It's a solid (if peculiar) cast of mostly character actors, who clearly felt a need to put their muscle behind this story; otherwise, they're strangely placed here. Everyone turns in perfect performances, sometimes in difficult roles (Caan's restrained kindly-but-scary is wonderful to behold), and visually this is a striking work.

57,sahamh,"Truly An Excellent Film, A MUST Watch",9,10 July 2013,"It's directed by Tony Kaye who has done one of my favorites, American History X. Let me just be clear right now, I f@cking loved this film, it had been a while that I watched a legit film like this; films like these are relief and remedy to my soul. Talking about the story, my god, it's a pure emotional, tragic, and essential story, you get bonded with the main character so well, all his struggles and pain, his feelings and sadness, his responsibility towards these young careless students. It's a simple story, a sub teacher who feels responsible about his student and their future but at the same time dealing with his own difficulties. So indeed it's a sad drama story, but it delivers a heavy message with a lot of emotion to it, and that's I love it Performances are very fine; Adrien Brody delivers and doesn't disappoint in any scenes. Supporting roles are cast well, especially Sami Gayle, I hope she gets more recognized, she's definitely talented and has a long road ahead of her, which can be bright and successful. Even though, I get a feeling some might say her character was useless, I would totally disagree, because it shows Adrien Brody's character cares about teenagers, not just as his profession.One element that levels up the emotion in the film is the soundtrack. My god, The Newton Brothers doesn't disappoint for a second; their work seriously needs to get more recognized here. If a day comes with me becoming a filmmaker, I'd love to work with them for a project.The cinematography and editing are fine, for some the cinematography might get annoying due to some cam shakes, but honestly you can let it go and not be serious with, it made the tone more authentic in my opinion.Finally, I highly recommend this film to everyone. Even if you don't like drama movies please, still own it and show it to your kids or grandchildren at some point, this is a must see for any students, or even parents - I'm sure you won't be losing your eyes by watching a legit drama movie that has a proper message and lesson.

The film is based on modern ironic society where young students are the victims of dystopian world to fulfill the goals that is not easy. Achieving everything is nothing, the truth!It's easy to get spoiled and earn money in a wrong way, but hard to face the truth. In this film there is a lesson that we must try to learn. Bright young souls are getting dark without guidance, motivation, and care. Students are getting frustrated about the outburst society, parents blaming on teachers, teachers blaming on the students, politics is behind! Corruption, power, domination, enchanted like two-faced god! Love is getting very physical. Relationship has no emotion, no feelings. Daily life is getting filled-up with bad slang. Teachers are helpless to educate. Parents are neglecting their own children. This is the present social scenario of advanced educated countries and the future of developing countries.We are ironically educated to hide the truth. We have eyes to see the right, but we act the blind. Shame on whom? Shame is detaching us from us! This is a film that tries to put some light and may be given an example of hope.With love Vikram",Detachment

60,ssaimeri,1,8,20 May 2014,"Detachment. A uniquely stylized film that people, ranging from teenagers to adults, should be able to grasp at varying levels of understanding. Those who watch will understand and sympathize with the wide range of characters that the movie portrays, based on their own experiences and age. Teenagers dealing with the angst of growing up in a world that they cannot possibly control, can sympathize with the majority of the students of this school, displayed in varying and unique circumstances. Further we come across the point of view of those that are older and are searching for deeper meaning in what life has to offer them, or anybody, which exemplifies the generation of those out of schooling and not yet old enough for achieved wisdom. Furthermore down the line of age and maturity comes the darker beliefs of the elder generation. Stuck in time, when they really appreciated what they did and what they stood for (the golden age) and now seeing what and where they are today. It gives them a dismal view of our future, a future where society will implode if our youth continues on the trend that has been set. But in the end. The final message of this emotional story is that of a positive idea breaking out of a negative mentality. That maybe there is hope.

61,cousinoleg,A step towards love and goodness,7,16 March 2013,"I did see this movie a few days ago on TV, and it really caught my attention as being above the usual escapist entertainment movies. It deals with the detachment and corruption in all spheres of life, but especially the one dealing with school pupils, their parents and teachers.Instead of lovingly guiding their children throughout life, some of the parents just dump them in a school, expecting them to be perfected by school, teachers, psychologists, since parents are too busy slaving off for a corrupt system which expects them to be ideal workers like the cartoon character Sponge Bob, who had the mind of a child, and worked hard without question for a low wage and a void achievement of ""best month worker"".But teachers are as broken as parents; one is not made instantly wise and all-knowing by becoming a teacher, who anyway is expected to bring basic human knowledge to humans, not the love, empathy and relationships which are expected to be taught inside families.The main character, a substitute teacher, is a product of such a lifestyle, unable to be attached to anyone, who tries to be caring and helpful, but makes often mistakes and though he is drawn to goodness and love, doesn't really know the meaning of life and why love and goodness are necessary. He just urges his pupils to seek answers through knowledge and not to willingly accept all kinds of manipulative propaganda of marketing, where love of money is the top priority, but in the Bible it is called ""the root of all evils"".You may wonder why Bible and Christianity, since everywhere you can hear that Christians are often are (or shown to be) ""bigoted"", hypocritical, hateful and judgmental, especially with with all kinds of scandals related with the Church of Christ (body of believers) and priests. By the grace of God, i believe in His Son Jesus Christ, that Jesus died on the cross to pay for the sins of the world and was raised by God from the dead, so that anybody who believes this will be raised by God as well from death into eternal life through forgiveness of all sins for the sake of His Son Jesus Christ.So while this movie is helpful into raising questions about lack of love and detachment in this life, it doesn't say how to fix it, nor does it provide the stimulus to do so. It just says to seek answers. That's why i did in the past, finding the teachings of Lord Jesus Christ perfectly suitable for these problems - it contains rules and commands on how to love God and other people, what is good and what is evil/sinful. According to Christ we believe that God gives us strength to do good and love even our enemies, even though it seemed previously stupid, uncomfortable and unrewarding according to most secular teachings - we do this because of God's love, mercy and forgiveness, who opened for us the only door to salvation which is Jesus Christ.So if you're feeling dissatisfied with this world and seeking a better place - read the Bible, starting with the New Testament, which is easier to understand for starters, pray to God for guidance, forgiveness and repentance of sins, strength to live by Jesus' commandments and example. Also don't let the slander about God, Jesus and Christians keep you away from the truth in the Bible - since Jesus already warned about false prophets, whose deeds are far from their words, so not a self-proclaimed name of ""Christian"" does make one true, but their deeds according to Lord Jesus Christ.",Detachment
62,mittens-and-matches,Overrated,4,5 September 2012,"First lets start off with the good: Cast: Wow, great cast...Adrian Brody, Christina Hendricks, Bryan Cranston, James Caan, Lucy Liu.Acting: I generally like Adrian Brody. He is perfectly cast for this part. Generally there is nothing to complain about regarding any of the acting in the movie. Very well done.Dialogue: Good dialogue is important. Especially for a movie like this which is entirely character driven. Adrian gives some nice moving speeches and James Caan has some quite witty humorous lines. Overall, the dialogue is good.Vision: The creators of the movie were trying to create a movie that showed the reality of hopelessness in struggling urban school environments. I understand the 'detachment' they are trying to convey and applaud them for trying not to dress it up to much with a Hollywood tale. However, there are some problems with the execution of the vision which leads me to...The bad:Script: If a strong script is important to you: avoid this movie. The story relies on sucking you in to the emotional performances of the characters to create its meaning.Poor directing/Tries to hard: Unfortunately, many of the scenes are a little over the top. In its attempt to make us feel we witness scene after scene of extreme behavior. The chance to connect with the subtle emotions of real life drama are lost and we are caught up in a melodrama. The movie tries hard to make you ""FEEL"" something. Its a little like a sales pitch for sadness. I found myself getting annoyed at certain moments like I was in a live showing of Dave Letterman and the audience 'laugh' sign pops up to tell you what to do only here its this is your cue to ""feel this _____ emotion"".Overall, I found myself feeling like Rick Groen of the globe summed this movie up the best saying: ""Ultimately, Detachment invites us to feel precisely what it warns against, detached."" I enjoy curling up with a tub of ice cream and feeling depressed about life as much as the next person. However, I need my movies to be the whole package if they are going to take me there. Here about halfway through I found myself wanting to skip ahead some scenes because they were boring me. Indeed I felt a little detached.Want to watch something that deals with similar subject matter yet doesn't overdress it?

63,leereddy,An unnerving yet brilliant account of the education system and its teachers,9,4 May 2012,"As classroom dramas go this may well be one the finest I have ever seen. A compelling insight into Americas failing education system and the beleaguered teachers that inhabit it.The story centres around Henry Barthes, a substitute teacher who spends three weeks at a high school where the students are as troubled as their teachers. Barthes, portrayed brilliantly by Adrien Brody, finds himself surrounded by individuals who have become jaded to the point of breaking. His tale becomes even more complex when a chance encounter with a teenage prostitute, Erica, develops into an unconventional friendship. It's within this custodial dynamic that we see some of the films most poignant and heartbreaking moments, as well as some outstanding acting from Sami Gayle, who plays the vulnerable young girl that society has abandoned. The film employs a three part cutaway technique with Henry Barthes providing a narrative in the form an interview, as well as flashbacks to his childhood - which allows us an insight into why he such a brooding and melancholic character. The flashbacks are often juxtaposed with scenes involving Barthes grandfather with whom he visits in hospital through out the film. The third cutaway is an animated chalkboard sequence which I felt conveyed a sense of culpability and lost innocence.The film also boasts an extraordinary supporting cast; including James Caan, Marcia Gay Harden and a very brief appearance from Bryan Cranston, as well as a surprisingly fine turn from Lucy Liu- the schools doctor. The staffs sense of disillusionment and frustration, due to the students perpetual indifference to their own fate, is vented brilliantly by Liu in a scene that begs the question; ""where, and when, did it all go wrong?"" Though dealing with very bleak subjects and despite the characters ceaseless sense of defeat and abject loathing for their profession, there are still some heart warming moments in the film. And though it offers no suggestion as to how we can amend such failings in our education system, and that parenting has in so many avenues of society become bereft of any moral guidance and adequacy, it still left me reassured that there are those who are still prepared to undertake such a daunting and thankless task.If you're looking for an entertaining piece then I suggest you look elsewhere, but if you wish to see a brilliantly thought provoking film that raises more questions than it provides answers, and you're prepared for some uncomfortable moments, then you'll be rewarded with a film that is excellently written and directed and has some outstanding performances.

65,feguiza,Best Movie of 2011,10,27 November 2011,"Saw this at a local film festival with little to no information about the movie whatsoever; little did I know this was going to become my favorite film of the year, and that's saying a lot given that 2011 has been a blast for moviegoers with new products by Woody Allen, Terrence Malick, Lars Von Trier and Clint Eastwood.The movie revolves around an poignant substitute teacher (perfectly played by Adrien Brody) who arrives at a vicious school, where students go around bullying people (including the teachers) and basically throwing their lives directly to the dumpsteryou know, teenage angst and suchI didn't grow up in the USA, so two important things I must say, a) I don't know if this is an accurate depiction of any given school in America and b) I can't relate with the overall chronicle, which brings me to my next point.The beauty of this movie comes within the subtext, whether you can directly relate with the characters or not, the movie takes the message and widens its range so everyone is able to understand the actual meaning of the film. Let's clear things out, this film is not about a school or the basis of education, this is about trying our best not to give a damn about others as most of us just go around doing everything in our power to be happy ourselves with a lousy job, a loveless marriage, a constant sense of abandonment or basically a crappy life (all of the above portrayed marvelously in the film).Films by Tony Kaye tend to be really visceral with a thin slice of optimism in the undertones, I think this time he just went mental about everything, in the end you'll leave the theater with a slight sense of hopelessness, almost as if you're destined to watch daily misery without the power to control anything but your own life, as if the only battle you must fight is the constant reminder that even when everything falls apart and slowly turns into dust, you can't change the world, you just have to avoid the world from changing youThis exposed stunningly in the final sequence of the movie.Do yourself a favor, watch this film!",Detachment
66,nico-153,"An ode to teachers, to people who try to do good no matter what",9,27 May 2017,"This is a very depressing film about a teacher that tries to make a little difference although he realizes he is only a tiny pawn against a failing system. Not just the educational system but the entire world that is slowly, but steadily drifting into a failing society for most.No matter how depressing it is – and it is, in some ways it even reminded me of Pink Floyd's The Wall – this film is impressive and worth the time to watch. Is it one of those artsy pretentious films? Not at all. As someone in his review said (thank you bobmichigan1): ""Terrence Malick should take a look at this movie to understand how art films are supposed to be made not just images reflecting on a screen but real emotions included"". I feel bobmichigan1 was spot on there!The cast was excellent as well. But there should be a special mention for Adrian Brody. Not an easy part but so extremely well delivered!",Detachment
67,bobmichigan1,Wow wonderful film,10,25 February 2012,Terrence Malick should take a look at this movie to understand how art films are supposed to be made not just images reflecting on a screen but real emotions included. This was an outstanding movie and in my eyes should of got more recognition and probably the Best Picture of 2011. Adrian Brodys deserved a nomination for his performance as a substitute teacher who does not want a full time gig because he does not want to be emotionally attached to his students. He shows real raw emotion in his position.I just want to say props to the director who did an outstanding job not trying to be too artsy and trying to make all viewers happy instead of one group of viewers. By far the best movie I have seen from 2011.,Detachment

The underlying message is what's most important when watching this film, and it has to do with the theory of why we as humans are so emotionally detached and messed up. It all starts with our childhood and the impact our parents or guardian and environment has on us. The director did an outstanding job relaying that message. I can understand why Adrian Brody won an Oscar for best actor some years ago because he was really great in this and there's just something so moving about the way he can express emotions through his eyes. You can feel every emotion that he wants you to feel just by looking at those eyes of his! This movie is a must see!",Detachment
74,avital-gc-1,The solitude of teachers and pupils,8,13 August 2015,"I'm glad I watched it despite the fact different people said it was too depressing. It's an excellent film about education, about the high school system and the educators' helplessness. Adrien Brody is Henry Barthes, a substitute teacher, who, for profound sadness rooted in his childhood, doesn't want to remain too long or too deep with anyone or anything. Marcia Gay Harden is the school bitter principal Carol Dearden who doesn't understand how much she cares until it's taken away from her. Each of the teachers, except one -James Caan as Mr. Charles Seaboldt, is solitary, suffering, on the verge of insanity.And then there are the pupils, rude, violent, with no boundaries. They too are sad, sad, sad, we realize, and if they are not sad, their life is hard or they have no future.Despite all this,Brody as Barthes has beautiful moments of compassion, and he forms bonds with one student and one minor working as a whore. He also has very ambivalent relationships with his hospitalized grandfather. All these bonds lead somewhere, not necessarily good or bad, but humane, and this makes the whole movie worthwhile.Comparing with The Class (2008) it has a much more solid narrative, and unlike The Class it does not try to appear as a documentary. I think that in The Class did not take a POV of a teacher and his limited perspective, so you got to see more of the pupils' lives. It stated specific social problems more than treated the general state of affairs. As a film, Detachment is more solid with better acting, pacing and story. As a social warning, perhaps The Class is stronger.",Detachment
75,ohthatgigi,why not give adrian a chance to not look sad,9,17 April 2014,"Andrian Brody has the power to bring out the most profoundly sad roles and its not just because of his eye brows. He's a quiet and troubled teacher who's incapable of turning a blind eye toward those young misguided souls, despite the fact that he himself is suffering from a recently family member's death and constantly haunted by memories of his deceased mother. We started to introspect the question that can we maintain our saving grace or last shred of kindness if we areunder such circumstances, when our career is constantly getting sh*t atand ignored and even more tragically our faint hope for rising people's awareness and making a difference to the children still won't crumble into derelict. But IMO if we trim the sidekick story involving the unfinished romance with his colleague at all, the movie would be much more properly constructed, I'm kind of under the impression this line of story was not fully developed so instead of throwing a half-ass off- time life experience,divert some light that has been shed upon the redundant romance to the story with Erica, it would be my personal preference. The scenes when the officers took Erica away are some of the most heartrending moments I've ever beheld in cinema, in this perspective, Sami Gayle had strike me as a new scintillation among her generation. The always think it's rather intoxicating and predestined if some two total strangers started chatted on the street, and I expected more layer-developing conversations between these two. Of course he's been a father figure rather than a caring valentine to her otherwise the warmth would depraved to incestuous lust and perversion, but considering Erica's original recalcitrance and dangerously licentious life style, if His detached principles have had deviated a little, even just on the surface with more light-hearted bantering and edifying, the relationship between these two would be galvanized and worth more times rumination. I'm nitpicking in this film apparently. But I expected more from Adrian Brody, He can totally do his work just by his eyes, but in that case he'll stay a melancholic and poetically mysterious 'prince'. In some case the film only shows his dolorous and suffocating life and conveniently light-brushed some merriment, even when hes kissing his colleague his eyes were not looking at him. So in a way the character is still not quiet layered and chewy than I thought, detachment is the sort of thing he's been chasing for long and sometimes he did achieve, and we only get to see his own wound-licking after the fierce emotional confrontation. That's bit of tears-provocating due to the lack of main- characters' conversation. Surprisingly good moments: the humorous teacher's three ways of enchanting out a student's gangsta curse, His response when caught the kid committing animal battery live. The collective performances of the colleague is transcendental and brings this movie to another level, we can see those mid classed teachers' own collapsing doldrum in life and absolute powerlessness when confronting misunderstanding, ignorance from students and even spouses, and utter disrespect emerging from twelve direction and each of them adapt to this environment by either growing detachment. Some acting are relatively weak but won't affect the general quality. i also think the blackboard illustrations are well fitted but really movies should really try to not accentuating so heavily on the faces(I've seen quiet a few of them doing super close-ups on the faces, whether to catch their minimal facial expression changes or just for visual pleasures), for one that we started to not buy the story that Adrian with face will stuck in a substitute teacher like that and getting hurt, for two its bit of a cliché these days",Detachment
76,dimitriscisse,The meaning of life : detachment,8,8 April 2016,"First of all, you want to know if this movie was enjoyable and watchable movie . In whole, we see the efforts of a substitute teacher to try to manipulate the manners of unethical kids . I don't know if the situation that is shown in this movie responds to the reality but if it does then it goes without saying ''God bless America''. Because this lifestyle is starting to adopted in my country, Greece . Kids must not only assault the teacher but also offend him. Mr Barthes is very decisive and knows how to react in these situations. Adrion Brody acts like he was being a teacher for several years.As it mentioned before , we see the efforts of Mr Barthes trying to help and at the same time teach his classroom. So he helps a raped slut that is very young and takes him to his house in order to take her after. Mr Barthes is firstly an altruist and not a conservative teacher who doesn't care about his class. Furthermore he helps Meredith who is a victim of offensive language from their students because of her beauty.Suddenly we see the difficult job of a teacher. These two, Meredith and the whore are sticking in Mr Barthes life without worrying about the future but only for the present. ''What should I do later?'', ''Is Mr Barthes keep me in her house forever?'' , ''I believe that Mr Barthes loves me''. These are the thoughts of frustrated personalities that they don't have anyone in their life to encourage them . All they need is some moral support and someone just to listen them.Nowdays everyone is very stressed and they don't spend time with their children. For many they don't even care about their future . They are just ''mouths to need to be fed''. I see the prejudices and the doublethink'' To be nice I must be thin''.'' To attract girls I must be working out'' ( I don't know that girls thinking sorry ) . Is this what is called sense of life? Of course not. The sense of life is determined by the choices you do. If you do the right choices you will be happy , if not you will be sad. And that is expressing clearly on the dialogue of Dr Doris Parker with one student whose dream is to play in a band after graduating and doesn't even care about school .The resolution to this is that teachers and only teacher considering that the most parents don't really care must lead students ''seize the day''. The fact that they are school is itself remarkable considering that in another countries they don't have teachers . An uneducated person ,these days , is a thing that is being used from everyone . And the worst is that he cant really react to the mistreatment who is living because when he had the chance to learn things he reacted to his teachers when the teachers , the good teachers, are the only one that they care about the future of the new generations.",Detachment

The supporting cast was also great. My opinion on this film may be biased, solely on the fact that I only enjoy films that touch the heart and soul (or at least makes me think/feel) and this is one film that made me want to go out and change the world for the better.This film is well worth while to watch from beginning to end.

79,horrorshowmovie,Has potential,6,26 February 2012,"""Detachment"" has some nice bits, but they get bogged down by unnecessary adornment. The movie is about teachers at an inner city public school. If it just followed these teachers and observed their lives, it would be a better movie. The actors are all good enough to carry that kind of movie. Instead of taking this approach, it shoe-horns the material onto a narrative that doesn't fit. How many movies have you seen where a well- meaning man takes in a teenage prostitute, not for sex? If you've seen it as much as I have, you're probably pretty sick of it. It's a fantasy that caters to the viewers. It has nothing in common with reality. It's also the centerpiece of ""Detachment.""The chalk illustrations and flashbacks are similarly ill-suited. Flat realism would be a lot more effective.I do recommend seeing this movie, especially if you liked ""American History X.""

How'd the narrator get from who he is shown to be in the story, sans beard, to the guy narrating the story, with beard? I think the narrator, the necessity for him, let alone the very presence of him, is a weakness in the movie, but in the skeem of a really fine film like this, it's a minor mistake. The viewer, then, by the narrator's narration, understands that some water has flowed under the bridge since the last scene in the actual story. Tho many write that this movie is ""about a substitute teacher"", one who has trouble staying put wherever, I don't think it's about that. It's about community, community as it manifests, permeates, and undermines or supports a school in it's midst. It's about fighting indifference, violence, chaos--entropy--by the simple act of caring.",Detachment

82,lukas8,No insight to be found here,4,15 August 2012,"I had high hopes about this film, but it left me feeling annoyed.First, the positive. The cinematography is attractive and the scenes are well constructed visually. If you are looking for open-ended existential questions, you will find a few of those. If you are looking for Adrian Brody to do his sad eyebrow face, you will not be disappointed. There are a few cameos by other great actors, if you are in to that sort of thing.Now, the negative. This film does not offer any valuable insight into any of the problems that it addresses. It gives a sensationalist portrayal of the difficulty of being a teacher in a failing school, the apathy of students and teachers, and the aftermath of childhood abuse. It emphasizes each of these problems without offering any kind of understanding beyond the expression of listless angst. All the vague statements that Adrian Brody says into the camera are certainly less than the sum of their parts.I don't expect all films to offer insight. When the subject matter are issues that people care deeply about, it is nice, but if a film doesn't offer insight at least it can offer entertainment. Well, not this one. The story is aimless and meandering. The child actors are not believable. Instead of watching this movie you might consider just sitting in a corner to think about how bad life can be, and then blame it all on parents without really trying to understand the situation.

83,Polygone,Haunting.,10,20 May 2014,"There's something utterly haunting about this movie. Something that lies within the whole atmosphere created by the atypical cinematography & the story itself.

Henry Barthes is one of the most haunting, wounded character I've encountered in films, movies or whatever and the portrayal done by Adrian and, once again, the cinematography communicate perfectly his sadness and the whole helplessness & unforgivingness I felt characterized this story and, well, life itself - in fact, almost every characters in this story is wounded in one way or another and actresses & actors did a great job.For everyone who enjoyed this one, I recommend Short Term 12.

84,kkokkolatos,This is about Courage,10,20 July 2017,"This film was beyond great. I firmly believe that not a known award is equal to the film's greatness. These characters seemed to be made by the hardest stone. So deep, emotional and strong. I could see them from my screen and right away, I was able to feel them, to hear them in real life. Their pain, misery, the feeling of lack of security, their crying, their laugh...Got into my soul.That's the main reason which the movie was made: to come into you. And it has succeeded as hell. It didn't show life at its best, neither life at its worst; only life as it is. We didn't see our characters actually heal, we didn't see them being truly happy. We saw their improvement, how the got an actual help. Eventually, that's life. To finish your time helping yourself, helping others. this is the way to true happiness. And, as the movie says, for all of this you need courage, bravery, strong attitude. Letting down is sure easily than trying hard to be better. Yes, true. But that is something that gets you into spiritual trouble. Thus, the main character was the key to give, not solutions to others problems, but to give them inspiration. There was a great accomplishment in that.Camera was awesome, as so editing. The colors were as I best like them. Music fitted nice. 10/10. Detached gave me chills.",Detachment

It's poetic in what it portrays but also very bleek. So much in-fact, it's almost depressing. That's not to say there aren't a few joyful moments in the film, it's definitely a harsh reality as-well as an insightful way to express the issues that flood today's educational system in America. But it's much more then that, which is what I like the most about the film. It's an entire metaphor about life, it's ups and downs, how it effects everyone differently and how each individual person copes. It's symbolic in how it expresses that there is hope for those who struggle long enough to find it, if you've yet to lose yourself. If your deep into indie dramas, I say this is a good pick.

86,RainbowCastel,Detachement,10,29 July 2012,"We watched this movie thinking it would be a sort of dramatic view or portrait of general schools in US today. To our great surprise, we were submerged breathless, deep inside a personal tragedy and national state of education in US of A.We were expecting to see some prejudice. As it is accepted as a normal tendency in US to presume every single male in presence of younger children or relation between teacher and student, the adult being a potential child molester or someone with sexual intentions! Unfortunately as we were expecting, we were served in some point against the main character.We got an overview of the political and sociological corruption of the education system in this country through an example of a public school with stupid parents and children spoon-fed to all sort of advertising propaganda.Today shareholders, total number of sales and percentage of profits are scattering a dark veil on the education system of a country and its future generation. A country being the most powerful country in the world having the power to influence the future of the others.Now, if they start to grow up under a corrupt propaganda and dumb-down mainstream media and political system, what hope can the future generation hold on to? 10 minutes of glory on a cable TV show, singing? Ironically it seems after 70 years we have learned nothing from the history and recent WW II with hundreds of thousands of hours of documentaries and movies.It is a dark feel-good movie which at the end you won't feel neither satisfied nor hopeful in the future of this failed system and country.

87,TheCineSinge,Surprisingly Disappointing,4,22 July 2012,"I'm afraid I have to count this among the few films this year that I was quite excited by but ultimately left me disappointed. I found a lot of it was quite cheap (mostly from a good deal of the melodramatic acting on display) and throughout the film I couldn't wrap my head around the choice of shooting. The camera-work felt very out of place. For example, one scene could have five or six different angles with one using grain, another with use of quick zooms and then another with quick pans and the culminating effect felt very fake, as if belonging to a run-of-the-mill TV crime drama. It genuinely hampered my viewing of the film. Adrien Brody does well enough despite wearing almost the same facial expression for most of the film and the few touching moments of the 97 come from his interaction with Grandpa. There's chemistry there but there are simply no sparks between other characters. There are a few good cameo performances from Bryan Cranston and James Caan yet they don't seem to add anything to the film and this is amongst dubious performances from the supporting cast (Marcia Gay Harden, Christina Hendricks and Betty Kaye). There was a lot more to be left wanting from them. On the other hand, that's possibly the result of the writing as their characters don't feel overly convincing.I hate singling an actor out as the worst but I can't not mention Lucy Liu who overacted just about every second she was on screen. She was the main culprit of the melodramatic acting scattered amongst this film. Cringe just about does it justice. One of it's bigger problems is that it tries to handle too much. Education, youth, family problems, childhood trauma and prostitution amongst others and the result is that none of these issues are tackled full-on instead being treated bit by bit.Bryan Cranston said he took his part in this as he liked the script and believed in it. I don't doubt his judgement, personally, but if that's the truth then I'm very surprised by the film's execution of it. A long way off for a director who (just about) gave us American History X. I loathe being so negative about a film, one of which there were elements to like, but I guess it stems from the great sense of disappointment and dissatisfaction Detachment left me with.",Detachment
88,drew-288-135826,A true work of art,10,21 September 2012,"Pretty much the only place Detachment suffers is a few moments of choppy, unnatural acting. However, it's a rare drama that doesn't rely on bold, pitch-perfect performances to carry the film, but rather a brutal yet focused mindset on the real issues the film examines with honesty and no false answers to try soften the blow.Adrian Brody plays a substitute English teacher named Henry, who is filling in for a week or so at a failing inner city high school. His first encounter with the students in his first hour class results in an unruly, disrespectful young man being sent out within minutes. Henry is completely untouched by any words thrown at him, yet not in any power-asserting way. He kicks out the student with literally no care. He doesn't tell the student to go the dean's office or anywhere specific; go anywhere, just get out of the classroom if he doesn't want to learn.Henry is also a great teacher. His students love him even after only having him for only a couple days. He is not nourishing, but he is understanding, letting his students talk to him while keeping his distance. His most prominent characteristic seems to be the titular sense of Detachment. Henry is not the optimistic teacher we've seen in countless education based films where a teacher strive to lift his or her student's spirits up. Henry is cynic, haunted by a past not made clear but hinted at. He talks about teachers entering the field with aspirations to make a difference, build future leaders, and change a culture of failure into one of achievement, before running into the harsh reality that there is only so much an educator can do. We're left to wonder if Henry is talking about himself or not.The film does not follow a conventional plot. It exists within a certain time frame, but one that can be placed at any time at any school in the country. Watching the movie is like looking through a lens that shows a general picture of the public school system. Tony Kaye doesn't use this picture to make any statements. He's not interesting in giving any opinions. Detachment is a true work of art that takes an objective look at a vital issue without pointing any fingers, not calling for instant resolutions.Too many dramas place too much weight on their actors to carry the film's power. Detachment hold it's own. Many sequences of dialog do not sound natural – particular scenes where Henry has one on one conversations with students – and they are the weak spots in this film. However, these scenes hardly affect the viewing experience because the film never sets itself up to be all about singular performances. What's most important is what those moments add to the story, and how they reflect reality, even if it is not a perfect reenactment of reality. That said, Adrien Brody as Henry is not to be thrown under the bus. Brody leads an ensemble that does every character justice, even with limited screen time.Detachment is not a film out to inspire anyone or give ideas on how to fix the system. It does nothing more than what a piece of filmmaking should do: make viewers think. Hopefully watching this film will cause one to consider what really is standing in the way of inner city children and a good education, and the answer is not bad teachers or not enough funding. Can you see what it is? I guess the follow up to that would be, ""can anything really be done about it?""",Detachment

Sami Gayle is entering the domain of the elite and it's such a shame that her role and acting in this movie is in parallel lines with her small time, shallow role in ""Blue Bloods"" , so people (including me) might think she's just a new next-door beauty before watching ""Detachment"" . Furthermore, James Caan, Tim Blake Nelson, Lucy Liu and of course Marcia Gay-Harden all deliver greatly.Plot-wise, this isn't your every now and then ""American Beauty-influenced"" drama. This movie stands out with a new forwards and backwards flow of characters and their approach.

Also this film is a mirror of that we all need someone who will understand our unexplainable or explainable inner sadness,no matter how old we are,no matter we are teachers or students,we all have things within us that is hard to keep in ourselves... Flick delivers many good messages like that. So movie is about true sadness and consequences of not sharing our inner sadness or sharing them wasted.... You are never fully broken until you're alive and there is at least one person who wants to listen,or share things with u!

94,rovshan-g5,Very Good and not for everyone,9,8 November 2014,"This movie was in my ""movies to watch"" list for a long time. I did not really see the trailer before and always i was looking at it and just let it go. Once i thought like its been long time that this movie in my list and i have to watch. So i did and this movie really influenced me. For my point of view, makers of this movie tried to touch very important point. I think the only people who can really like this movie are the ones who have life like that or know someone like that. People around you looks really stupid. They are not educated and they do not know what is going on in the world. You do have an idea about reality, but you still cannot change or do anything, because you are always thinking, but not doing. Even if you want to do something, you do not know what to do, so you decide just live and do not care about anything. Live for yourself. But, you know it does not matter how cold you are and you do not care about anyone, you still have feelings in the depths of your heart. I advice to watch.",Detachment

96,disa-meyer,Heartbreakingly accurate superb movie,8,7 March 2021,"I love movies and have never felt the need to write a review until now. I came across this movie because someone had used a segment in tiktok. Of all the places to find something the that's moved me beyond words.This movie is just heartbreaking. I was in tears from the beginning. Look it's not a happy film. If you're expecting to see something like Lean on Me or Gangsters Paradise let me stop you right there. There are no happy endings and feel good moments. I lie. There is one and the movie is so depressing that this moment of happiness makes you cry even harder. The sad reality is that teachers face such a hard time. They face abuse in every aspect and then when one comes along and retires to help it's misinterpreted by both the student and their peers. I can't imagine what hell teachers go through everyday. Parents either don't care or can't be assed with their kids. Kids are just acting out like they see their parents. And teachers have to suffer threats of violence everyday but cannot defend them self at all. The system is broken and no one seems to care except these teachers who literally risk their lives by trying to help.The acting in this movie is outstanding. You feel each teacher's pain and struggle. And you feel for the students to a degree. You have this young girl who is barely 16 whoring herself out there. Where are her parents for gods sake? There are too many stories like this for anyone to care about one individual.Sometimes I wonder in order to help someone do you need to be broken first? Because you can't help yourself on your own. But helping someone else maybe just maybe you can fix yourself somewhere down the line.Watch this movie because we can no longer hide behind the reality that this is. There is only so much we can ignore and continue to allow to happen in day to day life. Children nowadays are going to have so many problems because society is scared to do something for fear of being accused of child abuse and neglect. Can't you see that by doing nothing and turning a blind eye, this in it's own right is abuse of the worst kind.",Detachment

This film singlehandedly convinced me not to teach, for I have not the courage to deal with the insoluble challenge that is the American educational environment. I say with no restraint that this is the starkest picture of our underfunded, largely forgotten, malnourished school system I've ever seen.

Immersed in trauma himself, he felt connection with students who revealed the troubled home life.
At one point, a teenage street hooker desperately offered him service, to be provided a shelter by him instead. The way he sees them followed with humane treatment highlights a troubled mental issue in teenagers, often disregarded as inexperienced enough to have real problem. Some scene dismiss potential objectification of young girls as he saw through them into their fragility as human being instead. The teachers, expected to be wise and enlightened, also portrayed undergoing mental breakdown, even as student counsellor.It has beautiful poetical visual that is also somewhat disturbing, in a way it shows the worst thing that could happen to anyone.

100,missjeangarside,Depressing,1,7 February 2015,"So last night on Netflix, we had a choice of two movies, Dallas buyers club and this, i decided that Dallas Buyers Club looked a bit too depressing for a Friday night. So we opted for this. IMDb average rating on this 7.7 ? Seriously did all the people who have raved about this forget to take their Prozac this morning? Im glad I didn't forget to take mine! First of all the cast list looked like it was going to great, Adrien Brody, Bryan Cranston (who was in it for all of 2 minutes if that whose appearance had no relevance to the story whatsoever) Lucy Liu yeah she was in it but for what purpose? No idea. SO this teacher is a substitute who is 'detached from emotion' due to his mums suicide when he was little and we are left wondering if granddad abused her, with no real background just snippets of dodgy camera work in whacked out colours. He takes pity on an underage prostitute and takes her under his wing. One of the pupils who he is teaching likes him, says she wants to talk asks him if he likes her, he consoles her by giving her a cold hearted cuddle and then gets practically accused of touching her, leaving her to commit suicide and he tries to save her. No idea about the relationship with the prostitute as he didn't get it on with her-and think they may have been just friends. Suspected paedo Grandpa died in a nursing home that weren't looking after him. In a nutshell thats about it. Adrien Brody was emotionally detached hence the name of the film. But left me emotionally detached as a viewer thinking seriously what is the point of this. My husband was left physically detached as he fell asleep! Friday night movie night - Wasted.",Detachment

This is not a movie to watch if you are looking for something to lift your mood. On the contrary, it's a very depressing movie but its message is clear: proper education and helping the others without asking for much in return is the only way to make sure we are going to have a good future.The story is about a substitute teacher who ends up at a school with difficult students (similar to Dangerous Minds) but he connects with the students by showing them that he is broken and helpless just like that. There is also another plot line with a young prostitute and how their relationship develops and begin to trust each other.I highly recommend this movie but keep in mind that it is not a happy film.

103,Connor3820,"Pretentious, Contrived.",5,25 November 2012,"I had high expectations for this film. Tony Kaye had not come out with one since the excellent ""American History X"" almost 15 years ago, In which he took on some very controversial issues and made a very ambitious and thought provoking look at how racism effects individuals. With ""Detachment"" it's as if he tried to one-up his last film, which resulted in a pretentious, contrived roller coaster of emotions and extreme characters. This film is a fine example of simply too much going on. The film is well cast, but that doesn't save a bad storyline. Stylistically the film must have been shot on a DSLR, and it looks as if the operator walked around with it freely in his hands for most of the movie, due to shaky camera work.We have numerous characters that are all dealing with what would seem to be their rock bottom. Instead of taking a few characters and delving into what brought them to this point, we have a movie that goes 0-60 in the opening scenes and stays that way throughout the whole film. There is no down time, it's just a constant bombardment of extreme conditions and emotions, which just doesn't feel real and is definitely not wholly believable. The reason I didn't give it a lower rating than I did is because It kept my attention the whole way through, but it wasn't for the right reasons.",Detachment

107,juvest,"Powerful dark movie, with a hopeful ending",8,5 November 2013,"Detachment portrays a glum view of the current education system at what could be any city school and the life of young children who are not supported by their parents. It is full of cynicism and the entire film is shrouded in darkness that comes out exemplary in Adrien Brody's performance. What stayed with me the most was not the bleak lives the children live, but rather the look behind the scenes at the teachers. In one beautiful scene James Caan tells Lucy Lui's guidance counselor character that ""no one ever says thank you"". I don't think many people stop to think how their actions affect teachers, people who are essentially there to help them develop as people and support them. I hope this movie can inspire people to think back on their school life and maybe just write one teacher that stood out and say thank you. Brody's character gives narration throughout the film that give the story a good direction and while the climax of the movie is not surprising, it is beautifully done, with a flashback to Brody's mother that adds pain without being too obvious. Now the film could have ended at the climax with a dark and bleak ending, but it does not. The ending in my eyes is beautifully done and left me in tears, not out of sadness but out of hope.",Detachment
108,peterogers2,It's better than that,10,19 October 2013,"This film, like Last Temptation of Christ, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and Donnie Darko, is amongst a very few to have succeeded in isolating the nature and power of humanity when developed in people, like Henry Barthes, as well as the predicament that comes along with the attempt to act on it. This humanity which inspires us to be better people manifests as a rescue and redemption impulse which we can sum up as ""don't let people get stuck in a hole if you can help show them how to get out of it"" – which is a bit like the Golden Rule (""do unto others"" which we all know instinctively to be both right but also, more tragically, far from generally applied), the conjecture is that if you are human enough, like him, to know you are connected to others, albeit at arm's length, then to deserve your own self-respect (the only sort of respect that matters) you have to try to get a ladder to them. This is reason stumbling about in a world that can't see it for what it is, but rather only its bearer who is then put on a pedestal and trapped in the unwanted role of redeemer so that attempted escape can be accounted as treachery and denial of self. The victims do not go for the idea of the ladder being offered so as to climb up and think differently to get out of the hole; that would be true education of course: they grab the man instead and put him on the pedestal rather than his idea. The victims wish to place their burdens into his outstretched hands rather than trying to accept the solutions being proffered by them, thus burdening the potential educator with the role of saviour through bullying use of his own sense of decency against him, instead of releasing themselves by acting on what is actually being offered; which is an inch to them where they decide to go for a yard. This predicament shows that the instinct to help when acted upon can easily rebound because the desperation built up in the victims can blind them to the magical offer of self-redemption - real education - concerning their understanding of themselves and those around them. These outstretched hands of the caring person are trying to offer the victims the ladder to escape but that is not always recognised for what it is and the consequences can be dire because the failures of those outstretched hands are then pointed to by the cynic who gets to prove that trying to help losers is a waste of time, which is all he wants out of the situation; proof of the good sense of hauling the ladder up, because the Golden Rule fails: so the callous powers that are the root cause of the problem can get on instead with the dire work of damaging and unjust appropriations against general humanity with not only a clear conscience, but now as a virtuous act. This is the way that rule has always worked since ancient times so we are actually being shown the cause of the failure of our supposed democracy. Those outstretched hands should amount to the victim's chance to escape from a vicious imaginary trap made real by the inhumanity of others and the lack of any apparent understanding from the controllers of an all-pervasive and overpowering economic governing system as brilliantly illustrated by role of Mr Mathias. The missing step is in the igniting of the necessary self-belief and understanding which would enable the ladder to be accepted at arms-length rather than the impulse of rushing to clutch at the ladder-bearer being yielded to. There are those, understandably and obviously, who can't stop themselves from grabbing at and getting their hooks into what they see as a highly necessary saviour who is interpreted as having shown personal love to them anyway rather than humanity; interpreted as the making of some kind of pass, and towards whom they only have to give devotion to secure obligation, accepting the pass: thus missing the point and wrecking the deeply felt mission of Barthes towards people in general. That would be the hope of spreading education too would it not? It is a remarkable film about education and its true power and meaning and the whole engagement that it can entail. This is so important that it should be taught by educators everywhere because it is what we are like, and why we are not succeeding as we should be in this truer mission. We just bore people and train them in ways that confuse and fail to connect with or ignite their imaginations or any other part of their finer minds. That's a kind of incarceration not release. Oh yes. It's a quite fantastic film.Pete Rogers",Detachment

The problem is both script and direction. It's scene after scene of tremendous conflict, a lot of which I would say is exaggerated. Every f-in character is conflicted. The movie tries to round out some humanistic side - but the main problem is that it pushes too far in every scene. Granted I'm all about reality and the gravity of the human condition and being real...but in trying to achieve that, this movie overshoots - big time. Reviews that give this movie high markings are from people who are impressed with the cast just for who they are (and they are great actors), and the desolation depicted. Rating on movie on it's ability to execute - the script and direction suck.

Sad in the same way slam poetry, for which I have great admiration, is sad when it talks about a certain reality. It's a raw story, a true story that we'd probably need to hear more often, to help us stand up and make a difference. As Mrs Amy Winehouse remarked, the message was cruel but the delivery was kind. Having the reality of this talkie (no spoilers) delivered with such high artistry, makes the message more bearable. A film is the result of a complex and difficult number of task: writing a good script, casting the right actors, editing the best way one can do, all under the magic wand of a director, producer, etc. In all these, Detachment excelled! It is remarkable to see A-List actors playing tiny parts, some even without a line. That makes the team work very palpable, it makes the commitment to the subject very obvious.

Every minute is filled with bitterness and disappointment for the teachers, the students, their families. Solid acting from all the supporting characters, and a number of cringe moments.I will be interested to see how this gets released. Much tougher film than ""American X"" to watch.

Even if you know it's coming, you won't be ready.
It's the betrayal of trust. That's what does it. It's a perfect scene. By the time it shows up, we know the how of it, but it's the why of it that matters so much.
Spoiler alert. Even when you know it's coming, you can't turn away. You fall into it like a tornado.
Our sad hero, Henry. Right when he has nothing. No job, no mother, no father, no grandpa, no real friends, no wife, no children....
Gives away the one thing he does have. Why? So he can wallow in his own chaos, loneliness, existential dread, bleak, black, dark, emptiness?
And what he gives away, but more importantly, who he gives away, is the one person who knows his true value. As if he can't handle that. As if she can identify him, hold him to account, make him turn his life toward something better (as he had done for her.)
And that's where the heartbreak comes in. That's what has you howling at the screen - Man, how can you do that?
You want to fall to your knees. You want to turn it off. You want to re-write the script. But there it is. Just as large as life.

The way Brody portraits this ""broken"", ""barely holding on"", ""yet strong"" character is beyond my comprehension. Once again he proves to be an amazing actor, that makes you feel things as you watch him. The way they gave the character a profound depth is what makes this movie so great. You can have a great actor and a lousy script, but in my humble opinion this movie has it all. Although I found some of the sidetracks to be a bit ""too much"" it all contributed to the ""nakedness"" of the movie. And the ""supporting"" cast is well picked. William Petersen has, although it being a real small roll, the facial expressions needed to believe him. Lucy Liu does it so gracefully and Marcia Gray Harden seals the deal with an amazing performance.This subject must not be kept in the shadows.

Oral sex on the bus, spitting on, and threatening a teacher without repercussions. It all lacked reality. The random animations, direct to camera speaking, and shaky camcorder feel didn't help.

128,nozametoshi,"Having notable stars, a sappy and melodramatic plot does not warrant a better film...",2,18 July 2012,"Having notable celebrities, an ""emotional"" storyline with a obvious, cliché message, tragic characters and cheap sappy music playing in the background and other bait that of which the Oscars or any award show would consume is the case of The Detachment, a 2011 indie film which won several awards. We often see this type of deprived, artistic and emotional piece about a substitute teacher trying to help illiterate or with poor grades, poor or terrible school filled with stereotypes and bullies that at first, terrorized and bully the school and having one teacher turn it around in the end, well the director seems to get a great idea to make another annoying high school drama film or more specifically a teen- angst film. Tony Kaye who is known for American History X tries to convey his elements of his previous films and try to make the most melodramatic and artistic movie that seems to be derived from other movies related to this.I am not sure what the director is thinking, the fact that we see thousands of films like these and people tend to get suckered into the bad melodrama and the obvious plot lines with poorly drawn characters with terrific actors performing them. I mean how did they get people like Adrian Brody, Christina Hendricks, Bryan Cranston, James Caan to even Lucy Liu — seriously, she went out of her way to get this terrible role? I felt like this was just a money deal for them and they were just told what to do. I don't want to begin what the film is about, I seriously doubt the plot would even care less as well; it's about a clinically-depressed substitute teacher who's been moved to the most illiterate and bad school that of which is being sold off (or trying to) by Mr. Mattias (Isiah Whitlock Jr.). Adrian Brody plays the substitute teacher, Henry Barthes who is this clinically depressed lemon (as one of the students called him) who isn't like the other teachers although the fact that the other teachers don't fend off the bullies are just as much as him. Anyways, after his father had passed away, he lives a fellow irritating, homeless female student, Erica (Sami Gayle) and has to teach a class full of stereotypes and bullies who try to imitate and scare off the teacher. The film is mainly about this substitute teacher drifting off from classroom to classroom attempting to connect with his fellow students while dealing his own personal demons as well. Oh there is also a overweight artsy student that loves photography, taking pictures of Mr. Wiatt (Tim Blake Nelson) who has gone insane probably because of all the bullying. The film consists of so much stereotypes and bullies that I am baffled why people actually like this movie. I mean, the first few minutes when the Brody character comes to class, there is a stereotypical black person with an attitude problem that threatens him and in the next scene, we also see other teacher, Ms. Sarah Madison played by Hendricks being spit on and threaten to get ""gang-bang"" by a black girl. It's really baffling that people think this film is ""powerful and gripping"" even though the writers of this film clearly play the ""racism card"" of having all to most black people in the school that have either an attitude problem or presumably be in some gang threatening teachers. It's like every teacher in the school are wimps that don't stand against them, even other movies that related to this plot have gangs in the school and there are less emotional people in those movies. I cannot stress how irritating this movie is, everyone in this movie is either an annoying, irritating human being or some pathetic, emotional person that does not have an inch of hope on improving their students. I like the fact that the director try to convey Brody's character feelings through him looking straight at the camera and the cheaply done artistic chalkboard drawings that attempts to convey some emotional impact. It felt like the director just wanted to have this movie be drenched with awards and have a melodramatic message and theme, terribly implemented to make it dramatic to the audience. In the end, people who think this movie is even good is either have bad taste in movies or some sucker who get cheaply suckered into the melodrama and say things like ""the movie has a gripping subtext that of which could easily related to real life or not."" So the fact that everyone in this film is some kind of bully or some helpless person relates to a bunch of people online? Wow, where did I see that be implement in a dozen movies that has been produced years ago? Seriously, I do not see the slightest thing right with this movie and I am usually prone to these movies.",Detachment

Four of us watched this together and our eyes were riveted to the screen. Adrien Brody is a genius. The acting is superb and the message is clear. A universal cry for love and acceptance seems to be the theme. The inside look at schools and teachers is dark but realistic. No kids left behind but what about the teachers? It is hard to believe that the movie never grossed millions of dollars. What is wrong with America? Whatever it is, it is reflected in our schools.

131,jdmonroeii,A great film for new teachers,10,21 July 2020,The film is good because it touches on what happens when you've reached and passed your peak as an educator. There will be one student who you care for and no matter what you do it could go either way. It's important to note these teachers even the substitute all care about their students but they've been broken down by years of abuse. The main character cares for his students but learns by the end sometimes you have to be willing to go the extra mile to make a difference. The overall theme of the film is perspective means everything. Teachers especially first year teachers need to watch this if for no other reason then to remind themselves that caring does not make you weak. You need to go the extra mile for your students because sometimes you might be the only teach who is willing to. On your worst day you are a students best hope.,Detachment

First of all Edgar Allen Po can learn a lesson here, never has there been something which fortifies my nihilistic views quite like the American public school system. The movie takes place in Queens/ maybe a little Brooklyn Ny. I don't mind the late night bus rides on queens blvd with underage prostitutes, cause that was the real common case pre 2000 NY. Though I believe the movie was early 1990's. Makes sense for that time. The Top tier cast playing these roles most likely as homage to their own teachers and teachers everywhere adding to their overall delivery and simply put my respect for them as actors and people. Brody is stellar playing at home on queens blvd, probably took that bus as a kid himself. James Caan offers the only much needed comedic relief, making it all the more memorable. I can't mention every actor cause the movie just needs to be watched and you should stop reading reviews and find a way to watch it... and stop ubiquitously assimilating yourself to movies that don't teach you anything worth while.",Detachment

There are two plots advance parallel to each other. At one side, he gives shelter to a prostitute, actually doesn't just give a shelter but reforms her and she starts having crush on him. The second plot proceeds when one of his students an extraordinary photographer, is abused and then relegated by the society, who considers her life empty and dark as her pictures, fell for him. He shows sympathy to both of the girls because he is also stung by the very venomous society.
But, sometimes to console and to be nice to others entangles you in so many troubles as he treats the girl, who has been a prostitute, as a child, she wants to live with Prof. Henry but he knows that it can't be happened. When he realises that she is being emotionally attached to him, he willy nilly has to send her to a Guardian House. On the other side, the student presents Henry his picture and expresses her feelings for him and he tries to make her able to differentiate between reality and fantasy, it turns her into a weird creature.
Actually, this movie deals with two extremes. In the end, the teenage girl behaves like normal humans and is pictured as writing a diary or some kind of journal. But the student, what happens to her? She commits suicide. This incident make Henry remember his mother who once killed herself by eating sleeping pills.

148,leffunov-1,"Great parts, but not consistent",6,27 April 2011,"I just saw this movie tonight at the Tribeca Film Festival's first public screening of the movie. The plot focuses mainly upon the life of Henry Barthes, an emotionally overwhelmed substitute teacher who often cares too much for his own good. The movie is serious and heavy-handed with Brody's character often giving strong judgments that are unrealistically tolerated throughout. The actors do a fine job of portraying their characters with exception to Christina Hendricks. Hendricks character introduction is as unrealistic as I could imagine. At times the film will switch over to focus on the other teachers, presenting teaching as a thankless job and life of harassment. Overall the story is muddled and not given space to breathe. Despite the all-star cast, two young actresses steal the spotlight. Sami Gale and Betty Kaye give heartfelt performances that I wish were more expanded upon. In fact, the celebrity presence among the teaching staff serve to be distractions from the empathy we are meant to feel elsewhere. A word of warning: political bias is very present. So if you enjoyed Waiting for Superman, you might take umbrage to the narrative.",Detachment
149,a-k-topalli,Should have been named Attachment!,10,6 November 2012,"Such a strong storytelling, such real performances. Adrien Brody is brilliant, way better than any words can describe. If he wins an Oscar for The Pianist, what higher prize would you give him for his performance for Detachment? There is no single instant of time during the movie that you feel he is acting. He loses himself entirely in his character. The opening lines are from Albert Camus' The Stranger: ""And never have I felt so deeply at one and the same time so detached from myself and so present in the world"". I cannot think of any better expression to portray this marvellous movie of Tony Kaye. It is not just about high schools, students and teachers, it is about unbearable vulnerability of being human at any age, facing our problems, not knowing how to handle them, holding our guards high, building walls around us to try to protect ourselves and finally surrendering hopelessly or hopefully. You will see those different choices people are making. This movie perfectly answers the question in Ray LaMontagne's soulful soundtrack song Empty: ""Will I always feel this way? So empty, so estranged?"" Watch it to get your answer... Life is so chaotic, not always in a bad way. It may bring happiness too, unexpectedly. This movie is one of those good things in life.",Detachment
150,EnterDansMind,A must see film that deals with the very real and very hard problems we see in the education system and our lives.,10,25 August 2012,"Detachment is a very real and very hard hitting film about a number of hard truths seen today in the education system, how teachers struggle to teach their kids when they do not want to learn, they don't even want to be in the building, how they are put down day in and day out for just trying to give these kids a chance at a better life, it is also about feeling very alone in this world, like you don't have a chance or that no one is really giving you one. It is a tough film to watch in some cases because it really does hit some nerves with the truths it deals with, it makes you empathise and truly feel for the characters and their inner struggle with day to day life.I feel as if every one should watch this film, not just for entertainment purposes. There is a huge reason it is my favourite film of the year, it just frames so many of the very real problems we see in, not only the education system but in our lives also. Adrian Brody, in fact everyone in this film gives a phenomenal performance and makes you truly believe they are struggling with the raw emotion they deliver.

152,iblogamerica,Windswept and desolate school hallways,8,26 April 2011,"The truth about high school is that it's worse than you remember it.Watching Tony Kaye's enthralling ""Detachment,"" you can't help compare your high school to the one on screen. You remember the terrible teachers you had, the sterile hallways, the asinine classmates, and the absurd assignments. You can remember the ""weight that presses on everyone"" as Mr. Henry Barthes, played by Adrien Brody, tells his class.""If you can just hang on, everything will be alright."" Mr. Barthes is that hero teacher that we love tell stories about. He's the Christ, the Buddha. He's meant to save us from ourselves. The problem? Mr. Barthes is a great teacher because he has no life outside of teaching. Like Socrates, Christ, Buddha, Gandhi, and countless other mythologized teachers, Barthes is a detached island to himself, without spouse, children, or personal life. He's a lonely dude.As a public school teacher sitting in the audience at the world premiere last night in Tribeca, I have mixed feelings about telling you that Tony Kaye has masterfully succeeded in capturing public school in a macabre and beautiful chalkboard sketch. His lush, mannerist portrait brings a gorgeous but searing light to the lonely reality of the teaching profession. Mr. Kaye's ""Detachment"" presents school the way so many of us on the inside see it: a windswept wasteland scourged of its humanity by a culture that burdens its underfunded and unfairly censured teachers with rearing, policing, and institutionalizing our children. I hate to say it: public school really is this bad. The few great teachers that our system manages to attract are barely hanging on from year to year, knocked senseless by a society that demands way too much from them.Adrien Brody is riveting as a seemingly serene but deeply damaged substitute teacher. His sloping eyebrows, sometimes treacly or overwrought in other performances, here convey an- inch-from-the-cliff hopelessness without ever becoming a mask. Mr. Brody's Henry Barthes is sweetly but searingly honest with his students even as sadly skulks among the halls of his school. Barthes is also furious-- enough to throw desks in his classroom and scream at a late night nurse at his grandfather's assisted care facility. In close-up, documentary-style interviews, Mr. Brody's eyes flash like lightning one moment and then become as dull as concrete the next, daring us to try to understand how one can care so much and so little. His Barthes has a teacher's countenance in this film, acutely aware of how important yet futile his work is. It's a career performance.Barthes' determination to be disconnected keeps him the perennial substitute-- in the classroom and in his personal life. Barthes tends to his grandfather but has more than enough time to help out two young girls, a young prostitute and an overweight loner. Despite his earnest efforts, almost none of it works out well. The complicating plot lines, all involving family surrogacy around Barthes, serve the notion that teachers must be dispassionate and alone in order to perform their jobs. The story survives its few yet regrettable school clichés by sticking to this thesis. Despite the fact that the number of big names threatens to make the movie look like a cameo-fest (Lucy Liu? Christina Hendricks? Marcia Gay Harden? Blythe Danner? James Caan? Really?), the ensemble gels together surprisingly well. After all, weren't your teachers an impossible cast of characters? Every character seems just barely above water as each trudges to the blunt beat of the school bells ringing. The performances are just fine, largely, but two are particularly successful. While Mr. Caan's grinning jester provides a refreshingly necessary gallows' humor in some of the film's darkest moments, it's Ms. Liu's imploding truth-teller that lends undeniable heft to the story. As a guidance counselor faced with yet another unreachable know-it-all teen, Ms. Liu's character finally breaks down, berating the student with a bleak prophecy of the child's future. ""You will NOT be a model! You will forever be on a carousel, competing with 80% of the country for a minimum wage job for the rest of your life!"" the guidance counselor screams uselessly at the apathetic teen.It's grim stuff, made more grave by the undeniable ring of truth.The ancient Greeks tell us ""we suffer our way to wisdom."" By the end of the film, you'll hope that is true for most of these characters. Somewhere on screen, between a silent hug and the opening lines to Poe's ""Fall of the House of Usher,"" you will find a glimmer of hope. But you have to work for it. School, as the film has drawn it, is a Munch-esque desert of detachment where the best anyone (teachers and students) can do is survive. But the fact that Barthes, and teachers like him, won't give up-- and the fact that Mr. Kaye made this movie-- tells us that hope is alive, if not well. The hope rests almost entirely in our lonely, detached teachers.",Detachment
153,ritewater06,What's happening in our schools?,9,16 June 2011,"Got a last second seat to see this at Tribeca and it was terrific. I wasn't prepared for such an intense roller coaster, but I was very moved. Adrien Brody gives his best performance since The Pianist and what a supporting castJames Caan is hilarious, Marcia Gay Harden is amazing, and Lucy Liu (of all people) is so vulnerableI didn't know she was capable of that. It seems like actors we have come to rely on for solid performances decided to experiment and step outside their comfort zone, under the direction of Tony Kaye (American History X).The film itself is a harsh look at the realities facing inner city schools. Brody plays a substitute journeyman teacher, Henry Barthes, who (a little too Dangerous Minds) connects with his misguided students but as opposed to trying to confront his students or make them read poetry (like 5 million other lame movies), he seems to share his own pain and anger with the world in order to connect..It really works. On them, and on us.I don't want to give anything away, but this is a film that confronts both psychological and physical tragedy, where every character seems to be up against their own feeling of helplessnessstudents, teachers, administration, and a young prostitute who doesn't attend school that Henry decides to help. One especially powerful scene is Parent/Teacher night. Shocking, subtle, and effortless. That's how I would describe this whole movie.Ultimately, Detachment was very thorough at examining the ins and outs of the schools problems through individuals and as a collective. But it also feels like a character piece about this tormented substitute. The movie jumps a little too much (maybe), but I don't really care. Tony Kaye does what he does best here, delivers a gritty, edgy, shocking, and ultimately important film. This is a director that should be making more films. I hope to see Detachment in theaters soon and I hope some of these performers will be in the conversation come awards seasonthey deserve it.",Detachment

Sure it is dark, maybe darker than necessary towards the ending; but considering so much garbage is being made these days it is truly a film that makes sense (and memorable).Anyhow, watch the movie. Adrien Brody's acting is Killer!------(Your review does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of text).(Your review does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of text.(Your review does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of text).(Your review does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of text).(Your review does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of text).(Your review does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of text).",Detachment
161,alexulumend,"This film is not brave , and frankly it could have been.",1,14 April 2012,"This movie was well acted yes-very. but there was not one single character who was a true stoic and kept coming back to embracing the positive and evolving as a human even the main character who was wise and kind yet was a coward in the end why must all the people in this film who are not drones who do have a conscience who do desire greatness also be doing actions that are so destructive and negate anything admirable within even though they are aware? the writer of this film has a very one sided bleak point of view that is weak the writer gives no hope thanks but we don't need another reason to slit our wrists.Tell the truth yes but than show people what to do with the truth -to use the truth as a tool to overcome, to know what to oppose to learn what is worth fighting for. guess what?there are people in life who have been through very dark times and overcome them and are better people now.... another unrealistic aspect of this film is that no one has any regret I understand why some of the people harmed themselves with self loathing acts but when you have a realization that it is no longer what you should do or want to do you also have a period of feeling upset that you did that, the girl who was a hooker she would in real life have felt a period if not for years and years of deep sadness to anger to shock that she had allowed herself to be treated so horribly by others and herself yet in the movie she just goes from being totally screwed with to screwing herself over to being happy and healed just like that. we did not need to see suicide as the answer in this film because it is never an answer. again the writer makes an angel a hero out of someone who chooses to do the worst acts of all to themselves.That's not heroic.. weather you harm another or harm yourself it is just as wrong. Worst of all was the torture and murder of an innocent cat.That was by far totally disgusting and the reaction in the end was ""well the kid felt like the cat"" again the writer trying to show some ""honesty "" by that as answer to harming and killing a totally innocent being-that was the biggest load of crap in the whole film-that sort of behavior is psychotic. I personally have had a very hard life myself, I have been violated, I have been abandoned as a child, I was homeless, I have overcome drugs and this is why I feel this movie is misleading un-realistic and weak because with all that happened to me I never harmed an innocent animal and I did feel horrible for any self destructive things I did after I realized they were wrong and I did not obviously kill myself as an answer.This film is not brave and frankly it could have been.It chose to show those who harm and than those who realize the harming is going on but do very little about it.Everyone -every single character just acted like their were stuck, frozen in self pity,smothered by disappointment, paralyzed by pain.We can not choose what happens to us most of the time but at some point after we can always choose what we do about it.This film is just a dead end and a cop out.I wish I had not wasted my time watching it.",Detachment
162,kevinabraham393,Wow... My first review & it couldn't have been a better movie..,8,14 May 2012,"At first I was a bit skeptical about watching this as it is a drama and I am not a big fan of drama movies. The only reason I watched this was because it starred Adrien Brody and I loved his performance in the Pianist and boy it was worth every second of my time. I was glued to my seat from the beginning till the end because of the idea, which makes Detachment so special. The animations during the movie just captures your mind and has been done fantastically. Its been a while since I have seen a film with such a well written realistic plot and beautiful execution. The movie involves you in it from second 1, though there is not much of a story as one would expect, but again this movie is about reality at its finest.The characters were strong and though the movie was a bit slow, it made its point and point well made I would say. Its a must watch if you like movies which are thought provoking and which actually make sense.",Detachment
163,vanityinjah,Detachment is how movies SHOULD be done.,9,14 October 2012,"Detachment is a movie that on the surface deals with problems that teachers face in the public school system. And in many ways, it is a movie about that. However, the subtext involves much greater themes of abandonment, parental responsibility, lost hope and the need for acceptance without judgment. There is no way to escape labeling this film as brilliant. There isn't a slow spot in the film's pacing, the acting from the entire cast is astounding and the script is amazingly executed. The main character, Henry, a substitute teacher, deals with the death of his mother as a child by care taking for everyone that comes close to him but himself. This dichotomy in his life comes to a head with two young girls that he has reached out to in very different (and dramatic) ways. By trying to give the love that he was denied for years, he has set himself up for a fall (and a rebirth) as both a man and a teacher.Anyone who has dealt with public schools as a student and certainly a teacher should watch this.",Detachment
164,briana-nguyenwin,Brody strikes again,9,12 April 2015,"This slice-of-life film revolves around a high school substitute who is just getting by, helping the lone, needy souls around him. I can tell you I've watched this movie about 3 times and I can't seem to tire of it. There was one scene in the movie that I won't ever forget. It was the suicide scene of the depressed girl who made cupcakes. Everything in that scene was so pitiful, in a good way. The white frosted smiley faces on the cupcakes, the gentle sadness expressed by the girl, and the sympathetic look Brody shot her got me teared up. Anytime I am acting on stage, thinking of this scene in particular helps me with my fake cry, haha. The theme may seem melodramatic. However, the visual symbolism and multiple uses of showing shots through taken pictures sets the mood as real and artful. Great movie for all teachers everywhere, especially those who are just starting off. Cheers!",Detachment
165,terrikim13,Henry Barthes creates new connections and undergoes various experiences which cause him to re-think his own emotional and mental state and of those around him.,10,13 September 2012,"I've never written a review for a movie before, but Detachment deserves to be watched by as many people as possible.Adrien Brody's acting is simply sublime and real, his character is one that is relatable to everyone because it speaks to the core of human nature today, a feeling of bleakness and hollowness that is innate to modern society. His performance, coupled with other superb actors, is only matched by the directing and unique animations included to deliver a powerful aesthetic work. The movie does not seek to answer any questions or provide any moral message, it illuminates and puts into words and images what most people fail to, or refuse to, recognize about today's increasingly dehumanized lifestyles and relationships. The dialogue is haunting and quite poetic, with many lines that stand out in the mind. This is the type of movie that will linger with you after the movie is finished and can resonate in a person. If you pay close attention, at least personally, I found that there is a great truth to be felt.I highly recommend this movie, it does not have high entertainment value or some outdated romantic back story but it is a beautiful work of art. I liked it that much at least, so I'd say it's worth a try watching.",Detachment
166,jrkordan084,Excellent,10,7 October 2012,"To begin this review, I would just like to thank Mr. Brody for being absolutely amazing in this film. He has always been a favorite of mine, and his role in Detachment only solidifies my belief that he is one of the elite actors of our time. I've seen several of Adrien Brody's movies in the past - my favorite being The Experiment - up until I saw this film. I have many friends that are teachers, and it's almost sad to consider the fact that they may feel just as ""detached"" as Mr. Brody's character. The film is an eye-opener to anyone who has ever neglected the hard truths that plague our society. The day will come when all of us have to ask ourselves what we've accomplished in our lives, however large or small. Great film, and one of the best I've seen in a long time.",Detachment
167,ken-everett,Excellent - every parent should watch this!,8,7 October 2012,"This movie is an indictment on the shocking state of parenting (or lack of it) in today's society. I feel so sad for the youth of today. And tomorrow. And for those who are gifted with the desire to teach. To try to save even one is rare and noble.. but the cost - who can bear it? Would that every person allowed into the space where the minds of young people are cultivated were screened and tested for the 'right stuff'.I think the most horrific, terrifying documentary about the tragedy of wasted school lives should be shown to every young person who sets foot in the classroom - because nothing else seems to get through to them. Every single person alive needs a sense of worth and hope and destination. I thank God that I found this before I became another teenage suicide statistic. My own children have seen the value of this and have adopted it for themselves. As a result they are self-assured, motivated and focused, and have developed a sense of caring for those who still haven't figured out why they're here.It starts with me. And it starts with you.",Detachment
168,daneejela,about being significant and to give significance to other,10,20 November 2012,"This movie is beautiful! I made pauses while watching it, because I wanted to prolong watching as much as possible. I was so full of emotions that I needed to take breaks of it.Usually I don't like animations through the movie, nor the false documentary part, but in this movie it was interwoven so good.The movie is touching, happy and sad at the same time. It felt so sincere. I thought that it would be one of many movies about education and charismatic teacher who comes and makes everything good.But it's really different then any of such movies I have ever watched.There are no bad characters, everyone tries to go through the day the best way they know, and do as much as they can. They are brave and week at the same time. It was very inspiring and I think that creator team should be proud.I think that I'm gonna watch this movie every time I feel bed or lonely.The only this that I wish that was different, and that, to me, doesn't follow the whole movie atmosphere was last scene.Although the end brings change in the main characters life, and its basically bright, the last scene shows absolute loneliness, lost of others, lost of hope. It is not kind of movie that should get ""flowers and butterflies"" last scene,but I would prefer scene that has some Others in it...because that's what movie is about - about being significant and to give significance to someone other - about that existential layer of love and connectedness to other.",Detachment
169,kaidrozd,Beautiful Inspirational Movie,10,9 December 2012,"This movie is unbelievable. It gives me inspiration to be a better person. A must watch. This movie hit me on a personal level. It focuses on people struggling through their lives and living with pain and recognizes that everyone lives with pain, and that is something we all share. the moments in this movie which show compassion are truly amazing and heartwarming. I have read what the director wanted from the movie and Tony Kaye did a wonderful job. He picked a wonderful cast and I don't disagree with his decision to cast his own daughter because she played the role beautifully and convincingly and I also believe it would be hard on any parent to cast their own child into a role like that, but she absolutely completed the movie alongside everyone else. I love that hope is recognized in movies like this because it gives meaning to what it feels like to be alive. I cried near the ending because this movie itself seems to me like beautiful literature.",Detachment
170,gnsweetprince,Viewing Mandatory!,10,27 December 2012,"Images and words from this amazing film, haunt my memories and have seeped past my heart into my soul. This film should be mandatory viewing for every politician, voter, teacher, parent and high school student. I'm afraid for my children. I'm afraid for my future. Teachers, students and parents deserve better, but that would require all citizens doing better, a task which I'm afraid may just be too great.""No Child Left Behind"" is a joke. The good teachers need better pay, more latitude, respect and support. The teachers with attitudes, burn-out, or just horrid teachers, need to be saved from themselves and put on the road to a better life. Creativity, imagination, individual strengths should be encouraged. Let our teachers teach instead of spouting the rhetoric they're forced to do, so their pupils can score high on state assessments. Teach our children well for everyone's future, not just so you can hang another ribbon on your chest or plaque on the school wall. Enough of my diatribe, watch it yourself.",Detachment
171,loydchrist,An education about many things!,10,17 January 2013,"I have never been so compelled to write a review of a movie before, because it's my opinion that reviews kill movies. However, the reason for it could only be felt if one watches this movie. It's so heart-stirring and thought provoking that it made my mind cry with no tears. I live ten thousand miles away from America, but the theme of the movie(Love, Children, educational system, parenthood, childhood, adulthood, teachers and above all the struggle of life) is so relevant and transcends boundaries.Adrien Broody is an amazing actor and with this movie, as become one of my favorite actors. He is one of those very rare actors who can emote so effortlessly. The sadness and melancholy that he expresses is so natural that he should be given a award for the saddest face in Hollywood.The rest of the cast is equally good. The soundtrack of the movie is so congruous to the movie that at times the background score will move you.I would suggest this movie to anyone who thinks about their problems a lot, does not matter how old you are.I salute everyone who was a part of this movie. I wish they make more movies like these.",Detachment

We've all been kids, we've all suffered the pains of growing up and having to deal with life being a teenager. This film brings up to light the daily struggle of all our kids in the world and their teachers.We devolve the responsibility of educating our sons and daughters to people we don't know. We trust they offer our little ones the best that they have, to help them be the best they can be.It is easy to connect to the characters, as we can easily identify them with people who we have met in the past when growing up.The cinematic experience is unique, soundtrack is mind-blowing and rides along with the movie at a perfect pace. Adrien Brody does an extraordinary job at sharing sentiments that are impossible to verbally communicate. This movie should be played in every school, it should be mandatory.",Detachment
173,dreamink92,your typical annoying art film,2,25 May 2015,"first let me set the record straight, my favorite director is Ingmar Bergman and no I don't like the avengers, so I got nothing against art films in general, but this is way too much. The thing that annoys me most about this film is how nobody took the effort to build these characters at all. they just threw in a punch of people thinking ""hey see those characters, here's no background about any of them, no development, just relate to them, love them and don't question why they're popping out and disappearing for no reason what so ever."" You just don't skip on character building to show cartoons, which by the way offer nothing to the story, just depicts what's being narrated. I have to say though, Lucy Liu's scene is particularly good. also the whole troubled man - young prostitute thing is totally played out, and the movie doesn't add anything new for that matter, just the same predictable unoriginality that stretches out through the entire 98 minutes (which felt a lot longer)",Detachment
174,fernando-696-581508,"Great idea, Terrible Film",4,17 October 2015,"There's no doubt that the film comes with good intentions. However, it fails horribly in it's execution. It uses terrible narrative and cinematic tropes that bombard the screen, making an incoherent cringe-worthy mess. The ya-ho of a director is reaching deep for sensationalism. I'm sure he's a good guy, with good intentions, but his choices and taste are blasé, overcooked, so yesterday, redundant, straight up cheesy. Has this guy walked outside his house in the last 5 years. Does he know anything of the modern world? Or am I talking about the script now. The world-weary school teacher who wrote it and probably won't ever write anything worthwhile again after this crap.",Detachment
175,leetkzzer,An outstanding film,10,7 July 2013,"I think many of the negative reviews for this film look far too deeply into the film. Yes, many of the actions portrayed by the students should have ended in repercussions, but that wasn't what the film was trying to portray. It was about a substitute teacher who didn't want to get emotionally attached to anything or anybody, and through his journey, he became attached to several people. I truly felt the emotions of the film throughout, and would highly recommend it to anybody looking to watch a film that brings out a sense of reality.If anything, it does make you think about how little some parents do to support their children, and how some parents react to their children's differences in personality.",Detachment

It exposes you to the harsh realities of life and yet manages to inspire. It gives you hope that no matter how bad things may seem even saving one life can add meaning to and probably save your life too.Adrien Brody's sheer brilliance in portraying a teacher who's fighting with his own demons while at the same time trying to help his students keeps you hooked to the movie. You can feel the sadness, the pain in his eyes, and it makes you want to know the character whose backstory slowly gets unraveled in a suspense-thriller fashion.",Detachment

179,liz8200,This is a great movie,10,19 June 2014,"The emotional depth in this film will keep you involved until the end. The main character Adrien Brody is a teacher who is hunted by the suicide of his mother, and her abuse by her father. Its about the human condition. A despair that's from old wounds that interfere with every relationship. While everyone is trying to survive from there own personal trauma they find themselves in unkind impersonal relationship. The teachers at the school may have started with good intentions but have become burned out. They had a desire to make a difference in the kids life but mainly found resistance disrespect and no desire to succeed. You can see how a kind word, acceptance, a parent who shows an interest in the child is what could have made a difference.",Detachment

Unlike the many similar 'teacher tries to save a group of wayward kids' films. This is squarely from the teacher's point of view, particularly Adrien Brody's character, following his daily struggles inside and outside school life. 
At times it is slow, focuses on the bleak and apparently unwinnable battle the teachers face. And is no more positive in it's hopes for the future of the students. All of this is quite deliberate but tiring.
At times the plinky plonky sad piano and slow motion is a little over the top.
