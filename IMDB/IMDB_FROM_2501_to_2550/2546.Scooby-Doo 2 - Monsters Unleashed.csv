0,TheLittleSongbird,A superior sequel to an above average film.,8,25 May 2009,"The predecessor honestly wasn't that bad at all, but was flawed in terms of story and scripting. I really wan't expecting the sequel to be better, and it was. The plot was better, more focused, and a little more faithful to the Scooby Doo cartoons. One thing I appreciated here was that the director sensibly focused on Shaggy and Scooby, and that added to the film's charm, as nobody could resist Matthew Lilliard's goofiness as Shaggy. Sarah Michelle Gellar, Linda Cardellini and Freddie Pinze Jnr were very good too, there are some decent jokes and there were some very good action sequences. Out of the supporting cast, Seth Green was a standout as Patrick, and Alicia Silverstone is likable too. My only complaints were that one or two of the monsters could have been designed better, and also some scenes felt a bit rushed. Other than that, an enjoyable film, with an 8/10.

1,SnoopyStyle,Should concentrate more on their friendship,4,19 May 2014,"Scooby and the gang Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Shaggy (Matthew Lillard), and Velma (Linda Cardellini) have become the toast of the town in Coolsville. The Mystery Inc members are the guests of honor at the grand opening of the Museum of Criminology where they celebrate the gang's previous successes. Patrick Wisely (Seth Green) is the curator and Velma is in love. That's when a new villain appears with an all-too-real Pterodactyl ghost to wreck havoc on the event. Devious TV reporter Heather Jasper-Howe (Alicia Silverstone) makes them the laughing stock and they must solve the case to redeem themselves. Then there is Old Man Wickles (Peter Boyle) who is the obvious suspect.This movie deviates from the well known franchise in two big ways. First they start out as popular and famous when they are always Those Damn Meddling Kids. The second is that the monsters are actually real. This is more Ghostbusters than Scooby-Doo. While change is often good, these are pretty big changes.I've never like this incarnation of Scooby-Doo and Shaggy. They are too outrageous. For all the crazy hijinx they get into, the funniest thing in this movie happens when Fred calls Daphne fat. I still like the group chemistry. Velma actually has a good storyline. Their friendship remains the best thing about the franchise. As for the mystery, Randomonium says it all. It's very random but that's what you get from Scooby-Doo. Most of the CGI are cheesy although it's expensive cheese. There is a couple of good moments in an overall weak effort.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
2,jboothmillard,Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed,3,7 April 2008,"Just like the first live action film this is cheesy, and only good for the familiar faces, well, that's it, still director Raja Gosnell (Home Alone 3, Big Momma's House). Basically Scooby-Doo (Neil Fanning) and best friend Shaggy (Scream's Matthew Lillard) are seen as the screw ups of the gang, and for once they want to be the ones that solve the mystery, so behind the others' backs, they are attempting to solve the mystery of the film. The rest meanwhile, Fred Jones (I Know What You Did Last Summer's Freddie Prinze Jr.), Daphne Blake (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Velma Dinkley (Linda Cardellini) are doing their own searching and so forth. The mystery by the way is that something or someone is bringing to life the costumes of old villains they faced, including recognisable ones like the Black Knight, the Zombie and Captain Redbeard, and this green gas thing or whatever is making them into real monsters. Also starring Seth Green as Patrick, Peter Boyle as Old Man Wickles (in the cartoons, he is the guy that was the Black Knight), Tim Blake Nelson as Jonathan Jacobo and Alicia Silverstone as Heather Jasper-How. Thankfully Scrappy doesn't appear ruining everything, and this may be the tiniest, TINIEST bit better than the first film, but if you have sense, like the first, don't bother with it unless you like Scooby-Doo, in which case, just the once is plenty. It won the Razzie for Worst Remake or Sequel. Scooby-Doo was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows, and he was number 49 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Adequate!",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
3,ma-cortes,Second part with lots of fun and as amusing as the first,5,5 June 2006,"Live action update of Hanna-Barbara's early 70s animated TV series with lots of entertainment and amusement . The film concerns about our friends ¨the Mystery Inc.¨ group with Scooby Doo , Shaggy ( Matthew Lillard ) and the remaining group (Sara Michelle Gellar , Freddie Prince Jr, Linda Cardellini )and takes place an eerie museum of criminology where are robbed some stuffed monsters for nefarious purposes . Meanwhile , Daphne falls in love with the museum curator (Seth Greene). The equipment members are going out to investigate with its van towards a dark mansion , whose owner is a suspect old man (Peter Boyle) . A reporter(Alicia Silverstone) accuses them as responsible a robbery . The Mystery Inc soon realize that they cannot resolve this case without help from each other .In the picture there are comedy, tongue-in-cheek , slapstick , humorous moments , mild diversion and is pretty amusing . All are given a preteen treatment which means no gore and no bad language just some old-fashioned sympathetic scares ; being funny watching humans meld into the CG characters . However , it contains bad taste when takes place a contest about fart jokes between Shaggy and Scooby . Of course , coward Scooby steals the spectacle as food-obsessed canine anti-hero with its grimace , faces and gesture . Many gags are good however the tale sometimes drags . Special mention to gags as the tournament between Fredd ( Freddie Prince) and the monsters , besides those intervening Shaggy-Scooby , they make a likable and superb comic couple . There appears even an electrifying monster similar to ¨Forbidden planet¨ film monster . Movie combines live action with computer generator animation on Scooby Doo creation , special effects are well done . The motion picture is regularly directed by Raja Gosnell who also realized the original . Kiddies may find the corny , flat humor as bemusing , but most adults will be disappointed , exception the fans the classic cartoon series created by Hanna Barbera . It is clearly aimed at the junior audience . Protagonists' antics might provide the silly smiles , but this cartoonist physical comedy is mostly ineffective . Rating : average but entertaining with lots of fun and as amused as the first , and it will be best appreciated by preteen enthusiasts of the cartoon movies . .",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
4,BA_Harrison,"More silly, spooky fun with Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby.",7,22 October 2006,"Someone has been using Randamonium to create real life monster versions of Mystery Incorporated's notorious foes. Blaming themselves for a series of screw-ups by Mystery Inc., Shaggy and Scooby attempt to prove their worth by trying to solve this case on their own.The gang are back for more spooky fun and, although this one isn't quite up to the standard of the first movie (which I thoroughly enjoyed), it still packs enough action and laughs to ensure a good time. The story is perhaps a tad hard to follow at times (for small kids), but the plethora of great creatures and continuous supply of (admittedly unsophisticated) laughs mean that the film is still enjoyable fluff for the whole family.Reprising their roles from the first film, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr., Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini look like they are having a blast. Gellar looks great and gets to perform more of her Buffy-style high kicking moves; Cardellini gets to act sexy, as she attempts to romance nerdy museum curator Patrick; and Lillard is, once again, brilliant as Shaggy. Scooby hasn't improved any in the CGI department, but that didn't spoil my enjoyment of the film.If you enjoyed Mystery Inc.'s first live-action cinematic foray, then the chances are that you'll like this one too.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
5,studioAT,Scooby and the gang return,6,16 March 2011,"Love it or loath it the first live action Scooby film was a hit and therefore it is no surprise to see a sequel.Pleasantly it is an improvement on the original with more humour, more depth and more monsters. Even the 3D Scooby looks more life like.There are some new faces such as Alicia Silverstone and the dearly missed Peter Boyle but by and large it falls upon the talents of Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardelllini to create the movies' magic moments. Lillard is as close to the original character as you could get and it is no surprise that it is his antics that dominate the film most though the sub plot about Velma and a possible love interest is also very sweet..Overall an enjoyable film for fans of the original series as well as those discovering Scooby for the first time.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

7,Calicodreamin,Fun scooby sequel,6,30 March 2020,"Definitely not as good as the first scooby-doo live action movie, but still a fun mystery inc. movie. The actors are so well cast that it makes these movies so enjoyable to watch. The plot and action scenes were a shade more ridiculous in this movie, which takes away from the movie a bit. Overall, its a mindless action/comedy with a killer soundtrack.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
8,Boba_Fett1138,An improvement over the first.,6,16 October 2005,"I had seen the first movie and didn't liked it at all. Still I decided to go and give this movie a chance, to see if they had improvement anything. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they actually did. The story is better and more interesting and the monsters and CGI-effects in general are more convincing looking. The humor has also been improved and this movie actually does have some entertaining and funny moments in it.Not only the story itself has been improved but also the storytelling. The pace is good and the characters work better for this movie. Also the actors seemed more at ease in their roles. Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar certainly improved their acting compared to the first movie. Still best parts are played by Matthew Lillard and the perfectly cast Linda Cardellini. Plus of the movie is that it also has actors Alicia Silverstone, Tim Blake Nelson and Seth Green in it.The monsters are enjoyable and are good looking. There still are some 'fake' moments but on the other hand there also are some truly spectacular looking sequences involving monsters. The character of Scooby-Doo himself is also looking more convincingly this time.It's not really a memorable or great movie but it is simple good entertainment to watch.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
9,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A step up?,5,25 June 2009,"I suppose I was never that crazy about the show. It just didn't really grab me. I don't have a problem with others enjoying it, and I can see the logic in making these flicks for those who loved it. The main problem is just that it really doesn't have anything to offer for anyone else. It does, in both of them, try to offer it up, and were it further developed, perhaps coupled with less thin, stereotypical characters to work with, I think they could really have something interesting. The acting tends to be over the top, which is not to say that there are no good performances, or at least moments of such. Green is a nice addition. There are more monsters than in the first one. The CGI is at the same level of quality, that being quite good. This has fairly well-done cinematography and editing. The jokes and gags are almost exclusively silly, and if you're watching this, hopefully you enjoy bodily function jokes. This has a pretty decent plot, and throws some genuine surprises your way. The twist is reasonable. Designs are imaginative and fun. The music is cool. So is it better than its predecessor? I guess it averages out to them being about equal. I recommend this to fans of Scooby-Doo and co. 5/10",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
10,neil-476,Another success,8,6 May 2012,"After the success of the first Scooby Doo movie, the same cast was collected to provide a sequel and this, too, worked well.Since the formula is much as before, there is little to add other than to say that the CGI was better than before. In particular, Scooby worked rather better and was incorporated with the background plates more smoothly.And it is also worth mentioning that Linda Cardellini gets an opportunity to change from Velma's boring sweater into a slinky red catsuit, following which she achieves the clever trick of managing to be very sexy and very funny at the same time.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
11,anaconda-40658,Pathetic Film Unleashed.,2,25 May 2015,"Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004): Dir: Raja Gosnell / Cast: Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, Linda Cardellini, Alicia Silverstone: Scooby Doo was a wonderful cartoon full of mystery and humour as well as memorable characters. This sequel is about fear but not just of monsters but of failure. After a disaster at a museum Shaggy and trusted dog Scooby Doo are blamed. Ridiculous plot regards the unleashing of monsters that Mystery Inc had already put away. Often corny and even the visual effects are horrid. The only exception is Scooby Doo himself who translated well through CGI visuals. Raga Gosnell directed the first film and plays off creative angles but acting is to the bare minimum. Freddie Prinze Jr. substitutes Fred's brains for stupidity. Sarah Michelle Gellar creates an unnecessary sexed up Daphne. Matthew Lillard plays Shaggy on perfect key but the role here is a mere prop as oppose to a personality. It is as if he was part of a vintage sideshow. Linda Cardellini does look like Velma but even the makeup job cannot bring the character to life. Alicia Silverstone appears as a reporter in her worst performance since her embarrassing turn as Batgirl in Batman and Robin. Perhaps she and Uma Thurman should both take a hint and avoid all films that involve superheroes and such. It is pointless candy coated dog snot. Score: 2 / 10",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
12,Wuchakk,Slightly better than the first movie,5,7 April 2016,"Released in 2004, ""Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed"" has the Mystery Inc. team taking on monsters from their past adventures brought to life by an evil masked figure. As with the first film, Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini shine as Shaggy and Velma. Freddy Prinze Jr. is pretty good as Fred while Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne doesn't quite fit the role, although she's likable and serviceable. I'm sure she got the part because of her popularity at the time. Seth Green and Peter Boyle have significant peripheral roles, as does Alicia Silverstone, who's a highlight but unfortunately underused. Whereas the first movie was shot on the east coast of Australia this sequel changes the locale to the Vancouver area of British Columbia. Of course, it's location is Coolsville in the story, wherever that's supposed to be. In any case, the extreme switch in locale changes the dynamics a bit. There also seems to be more emphasis on action and paying homage to the cartoon, which makes it marginally better than the first movie, for me anyway. Plus it emphasizes the obvious – that Velma is sexier than Daphne, at least with Cardellini as Velma and Gellar as Daphne. There are some worthwhile morals as well, like simply being yourself and not trying to be someone else. The film runs 93 minutes.GRADE: C+ or B- (5.5/10)",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
13,Smells_Like_Cheese,You have got to be kidding me,1,28 March 2004,"Oh, I wish I had my $8.75 back. Now, I did somewhat enjoy the first Scooby Doo, I had no interest to see the sequel though. But my best friend called and she badly wanted to see it. It was plans, and who knew? I might have liked it. We decided to see the 10:30 (at night) show, thinking there would be no children in the theater. Boy, were we wrong. What parents bring their 4 and 5 year old children to a 10:30 show? The jokes are really stupid. The plot is nearly unbearable. And the leading actors have hit an all time low in their careers. I was starting to wonder about Sarah Michelle Gellar, where she was going to go. Same with Freddie, Matthew, Alicia, and Seth. I couldn't believe what they have done to themselves. The movie is a success at the box office hitting #1. But if you ask me, I think this should be on the bottom 100. Very lame.1/10",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
14,disdressed12,"lacks the charm and warmth of the first one,and it's also less fun",5,25 July 2007,"i was rather disappointed in this movie.i just felt it didn't have the same charm and sense of fun as the first one.i think it tries to take itself too seriously at times.don't get me wrong,there are some funny moments,but there are less of them and they don't work as well this time around.i think they just got old.there's also a bit of a subplot which i didn't think had much point.there are a lot more monsters in this one,so it should be exciting,but it it really isn't.in fact,i found it slow at times.it doesn't have the same pacing as the first one.this movie also gets into the ""just be yourself,we're all OK"" syndrome.now there nothing wrong with that.it is a good message.but this movie shouldn't really be the forum for that.this is a type of movie that should just be fun and entertaining.beside,it throws off the pacing of the movie.also,there is a bit of innuendo,some sexual,some not.it's very subtle,but it's there.any way,i can't give ""Scooby Doo 2:Monsters Unleashed"" more than 5/10",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
15,OllieSuave-007,"Jinkies, it's a slower sequel.",6,28 April 2014,"Monsters Unleashed brings back the Mystery Inc. gang who must save Coolsville from an attack of past unmasked monsters they had dealt with including the Black Knight Ghost, Pterodactyl Ghost and the Tar Monster, who were brought to life by an evil masked figure.This is a somewhat adventurous movie filled with ghosts and goblins, with Scooby filmed in CGI, and Freddy Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini returning in their respective Mystery Inc. gang roles; each did a creative job in portraying Fred, Daphne, Velma and Shaggy. I especially enjoyed Daphne, as Gellar portrayed her as a typical blonde, but also being clever and witty. It was nice seeing Alicia Silverstone make an appearance in the movie; it is too bad her role was only confined to a TV reporter role, which didn't contribute much to the story.Like the first film, the special and visual effects were colorful and and flashy, and I thought the ghost action was executed pretty well. The story was, though, a little whimsical and the dialog and jokes were somewhat off-the-wall. The plot was a little slow, and wasn't as exciting and lacks the charm and spirit as the first movie.It is still great to see one of my favorite cartoons come to life in this sequel, which I think is a serviceable movie, but falls short of entertainment as in the first one.Grade C+",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
16,Buddy-51,What a Shame to Foist This on Kids,2,22 March 2005,"""Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed"" is even more vapid and boring than the original ""Scooby Doo"" from 2002. Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby return as the unlikely quintet who used to do their crime fighting in the two-dimensional world of cel animation but who now enjoy the advantages - or disadvantages - of three-dimensional real life sleuthing (albeit abetted by a bevy of high tech special effects). In this outing, they are attempting to uncover the villain responsible for turning monster costumes into actual monsters.Apart from some first rate art direction and costuming, both of which employ a pleasing primary-colored palette, this misbegotten and utterly unnecessary sequel offers virtually nothing of value for either fans of the original cartoon or newcomers to the scene dragged to the experience by well-intentioned but misguided youngsters. It's a shame that Hollywood feels compelled to foist dopey, lame brained movies such as this one onto innocent, unsuspecting children, and one shudders to think what the future movie going audience will be like having been nurtured in their formative years on cinematic dreck like the ""Scooby Doo"" franchise. Even Matthew Lillard as Shaggy, who was the one bright element in the original film, becomes simply annoying in this installment. And Scooby himself has to rank as one of the least beguiling and charming figures in the history of movie animation - CGI-spawned or otherwise.Beware ""Scooby Doo 3...4...5...6...""",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
17,bensonmum2,Where is the real Scooby Doo?,3,24 March 2006,"I realize that Scooby Doo 2 is basically a kids' movie. I realize that I am long past the target audience's age. And, I realize that it's a sequel to a movie I didn't care for. However, I grew up a fan of the original Scooby Doo cartoon. I was 6 years-old when the cartoon originally aired and I have fond memories of those Saturday mornings. The people responsible for making these movies have taken most of what made that show good and thrown it out the window. The ghosts and monsters weren't real. There was always a rational explanation behind everything that went on. Part of the fun was trying to wrap my 6 year-old brain around how the bad guys were doing their evil deeds. But a movie based in anything approaching reality wouldn't work as a big, over-bloated, CGI mess like Scooby Doo 2. It's unreal, it's loud, and it leaves nothing to the imagination. The film consistently makes fun of itself in that I'm-smarter-than-you, self-referential way that I find so annoying. It's a shame to me that young kids today will not grow-up understanding the charm of the original Scooby Doo.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

19,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"You're pushing your luck, Scoob.",5,3 January 2019,"'Scooby-Doo 2: Monster's Unleashed (2004)' isn't as good as the first film. It doesn't feel like a sequel or even an adaptation of its source material, really. In some ways, it seems 'straight to DVD', with only the returning cast and comparable CGI signalling it to be anything else. Perhaps it's the now somewhat garish set-design and costuming, the odd story structure and lax character development or maybe just the over abundance of young-skewing, child-pandering and plainly unfunny humour. The biggest cause, I think, is probably the fact that it isn't really a satire anymore, aside from one or two brief moments (mainly concerning the show's long-running 'unmasking' trope). Whatever the reason, this piece feels decidedly cheap - or low-effort, perhaps - and decidedly less interesting because of it. I guess Gunn got onboard with the neutered final result of his first go (or, he just didn't care) because, here, things are definitely aiming for a broader audience. There's no real subversion, it's filled with bland and basic character-work and the fan-focused deep-cuts are far and few between. In a way, this makes the experience more consistent. It feels far less two-minded, probably because the original script wasn't R-rated, and there are less 'inappropriate', faux-'edgy' moments (though there are still some here and there). It makes the affair less charming, though, because it feels like it was engineered as the most basic version of a live-action 'Scooby-Doo' film. It isn't devoid of entertainment and there are a couple of chuckles, to boot (mainly surrounding Peter Boyle and Tim Blake Nelson's new characters), but I'm sad to say that Shaggy isn't quite as good as he was last time around, either. Lillard turns in a perfectly fine performance and acts well off the more dog-like yet far too focused-on Scooby Doo, but something's ever-so-slightly off (I think it's the writing) and he isn't necessarily the highlight of the piece. It's difficult to say what is, however (perhaps Boyle's 'Old Man Wickles'). Most of the flick is generic and, quality-wise, average, at best. It doesn't really feel like anything at all, good or bad. Still, a bit of 'Scooby Dooby Doo' never did anybody any harm. 5/10",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
20,MLDinTN,more entertaining than the first one,8,5 April 2005,"Sure, this movie doesn't require brain power, but I found it fun and entertaining. I thought it was funner than the first one. In this one, the gang must stop a villain from bringing monsters they have captured back to real life. And Shaggy and Scooby decide they will be real detectives. I found myself laughing several times. One scene that comes to mind is when Fred is facing off against the knight and says bring it on. The knight beats him silly, and Fred says ""you brought it"" and falls down. Or Fred's interviews on TV. And the gang busts up Old Man Winkles meeting and come to the wrong conclusion. I even laughed at Seth Green's introduction. Velma even tries to dress sexy but ends up making some ""weird"" noises. Scooby searches for clues but just picks up a lot of stuff he wants. Shaggy says ""those aren't clues"". Funny. And I could go on and on.FINAL VERDICT: I recommend it for anyone looking for a fun film.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

I liked how they took some villains from the cartoons and brought them to the big screen. That was pretty clever. After the first film which was decent, I had no intent to see this. But, I eventually gave in.The gang is facing trouble in their town. The town is about to be taken over and they have been getting hit hard with criticism especially by this good looking TV reporter. The gang have to save their town before it's overwhelmed by evil.The acting is okay maybe on par with the first film. Matthew Lillard as Shaggy annoyed me more in this film than he did in the first. The others I think brought up their game. Alicia Silverstone and Seth Green are welcome additions to the cast.Overall, this is a better movie than the first. Too bad they are not making Scooby Doo 3.

23,CuriosityKilledShawn,Better than the first.,7,29 April 2004,"As a Scooby fan I may be a bit biased but how anybody can deny that this is just great entertainment is beyond my understanding. It ain't high are but it's loads of fun, and there are plenty of in-jokes for the wiser viewers. The movie is fairly mindless, otherwise it would lose its kid audience. but that doesn't mean there's no good humor or plot to it.Granted, the plot is dumb (the gang go up against all the monsters from the first season of the TV show, only this time they're real). The manic set-pieces just bombard us, one after the other. Once again, there's not a moment of boredom, but there are enough quieter scenes with the Mystery Inc. gang. The main stars are, as usual, Shaggy and Scooby. Matthew Lillard is dead-on as Shaggy, so much so that he actually replaced Casey Kasem as his animated voice.One moment that requires major suspension of disbelief is not any scene featuring sludge monsters or a cotton candy ghosts but a scene in which Velma utters 'I'm not hot'. NOT HOT!!!???? WHAT??? She's a total babe, more so than Daphne. Every frame of her is a work of art as far as I am concerned.The CGI effects this time round are thankfully superior to the trashy effects of the first film.

24,callanvass,"I didn't think it was too shabby, better than the original",5,27 February 2014,"Due to their illustrious accomplishments, the gang is invited as guests, at the grand opening of the Coolsville Museum of criminology, a masked man appears and wreaks havoc in the museum, stealing the costumes of the gang's notorious criminals. There are many culprits and suspects for the gang to choose from, but they have their eyes set on their nemesis, Jonathan Jacabo. A bitter news reporter Heather Jasper-Howe manages to coerce Fred into complete tomfoolery, making the gang look to be clueless. Shaggy and Scooby take responsibility for it all, vowing to become better detectives. Perhaps, it was because I didn't care for the first movie at all. I ended that movie feeling completely embittered as a huge Scooby fan. I managed to have some decent fun with this one, probably because my expectations were null. There is plenty of corny slapstick that is desperate for cheap laughs, but they manage to pull a lot of it off. How can you not at least chuckle at the antics of Shaggy and Scooby? The scene where they mess around with formulas was my favorite. I'm not that much of a stickler, it doesn't take much to entertain me. It was a bit of a switch this time around in attitude for the gang. In the first one, they are full of themselves and condescending for a bit. This one, there is doubt and a lack of confidence with them. It made for a nice change of pace from the first one. I've always preferred the confident, but humble version of the gang. Die-hard Scooby fans will get a huge kick out of seeing villains from the past from the cartoon show. We get to see Captain Cutler, Captain Redbeard, Miner 49er, among others. It was a neat little touch that had the fan-boy in me come out. Freddie Prinze Jr, is still a bit too stupid and condescending for my liking as Fred, but he was better in this one. He didn't bother me nearly as much as he did in the first one. Sarah Michelle Gellar looks amazing, putting her martial art skills she learned in BTVS, to good use. Matthew Lillard is epic as Shaggy once more, while Linda Cardellini is great as Velma, even throwing in a little love storyline with Seth Green (Seth was good, in case you were wondering) Peter Boyle is decent in his role, it was a bit of a throwaway part. Alicia Silverstone is gorgeous to look at, not much else to say. Overall, I had some fun. I kicked my brain to the curb, had low expectations, everything worked out fine. This is far from the ultimate Scooby movie, but this will do for now. 5.5/10",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
25,tabuno,Funny and Comical Live Animation,7,25 January 2019,"28 March 2004. What makes this movie delightful is the ability of the direction and live actors to capture the essence of the animated action found in the original cartoon series. A number of the scenes appear to be lifted straight out of the cartoon series like where Scooby Doo and Shaggy are prowling around in a house and you find them carrying each other just as in the cartoon version. There are a number of such scenes that really hit the animated button and is a treat to actually see it transferred onto the large screen with real actors. Though not perfect, this movie has its obvious flaws where some scenes are so overboard that it detracts from the flow of the movie and in some places it drags abit. But overall, the tone, flavor of the movie, even the flairs of emotional drama and simple moral and juvenile dilemmas that the cast face about being a nerd, being cool, being loved add an enhanced quality to this movie targeted towards children (except for the obnoxious product placement at the beginning of the movie).

Arguably better than the first!,10,1 September 2005,"Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed is a very good film that has a good cast which includes Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, Linda Cardellini, Seth Green, Peter Boyle, Tim Blake Nelson, Alicia Silverstone, Neil Fanning, Pat O'Brien, and the Tazmanian Devil! The acting by all of these actors is very good. The Mystery Inc. gang are really excellent in this film. I thought that they performed good. Boyle and Silverston are very good too! The action thrills is really good and some of it is surprising. There are many hilarious scenes! The movie is filmed very good. The music is great by David Newman and great directing by Raja Gosnell!. The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end. This is a very good and thrilling film. If you like The the first Scooby-Doo movie and the classic cartoons, Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, Linda Cardellini, Seth Green, Peter Boyle, Tim Blake Nelson, Alicia Silverstone, Neil Fanning, Pat O'Brien, the Tazmanian Devil the rest of the cast in the film, Comedy, Action, Adventure, Thrillers, Family, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Horror, Dramas, and interesting Halloween seasonal films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today!",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
27,leplatypus,Scooby 2 Much (DVD),7,15 December 2010,"As it was released during my first year on the job that explains maybe why i didn't go. Now i watch the DVD and i realized that i lost a good time.Unlike other franchises that equate sequels with changes, here the same ingredients apply and remain unchanged: ideal cast, bright colors and ""cliches"" from the classic show.Following the previous movie, the story has (a bit of) reflexion about the team and the cement that makes friendship. Here, Sammy and Scooby (much better looking in CGI) think they are leftover because they are (a bit) dumb! Morever, the writer pays homage to the original show because i think the monsters came from it.I think this movie is thus made for the fans by the fans and maybe doesn't reach to grasp the modern audience. However, I had laughs all along (above all with the table tools on Scooby's head and the door barricade) and i thought I was back into the 80's with ""Ghosbusters"" floating around.Unfortunately, we can't have as much movies as cartoons and actually this franchise seems really ... dead .... Will Mystery Inc. be come back from the grave this time ?",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
28,lisafordeay,A Silly entertaining flick based off the Cartoon show of the same name,6,4 March 2019,"Scooby Doo 2:Monsters Unleashed is the sequel to the 2002 family comedy starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, her husband Freddie Prinze Jr,Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardeneli and tells the tale of the mystery incorporated gang ran by Fred played by Freddie Prinze Jr,his girlfriend Daphine (Gellar),Shaggy (Lillard),his dog Scooby Doo and Velma(Cardenli) who solve a mystery involving costumes at a national museum that magically come to life by an evil masked figure. It's up to the gang to find the culprit and save the day.Overall the film is very silly but it's still a fun movie. Keep an eye out for former American Idol star Ruben Studered(I think that's his name) and Alicia Silverstone who plays a news reporter who's not all as she seems to be.6/10Another thing I forgot to mention is James Gunn( the writer of Guardians Of the Galaxy) is also over the script for this movie and the director of this movie was an editor for Mrs Doubtfire.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
29,GOWBTW,This is more fun than the first! REALLY CORNY!!!,9,5 April 2005,"Although Shaggy(Matthew Lillard), and Scooby hogged all the attention, this movie haven't lost its touch. Fred and Daphne(Freddy Prinze, Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar) were closer than the first. Velma(Linda Cardellini) was still the brains behind the group, yet the most insecure of the group as well. She seems to work well with Shag and Scoob rather than Fred and Daph. Shaggy and Scooby are always the cowardly of the group, yet they never realize how well they're good at finding clues that the others don't. This movie is also more musical than it was in the first one. It was sure a howl when Scooby had on that afro. He was really FUNNY! Unfortunately, he really gave out that term ""wigging out"". Velma didn't lose her glasses that much in this movie. I think she is hot, with and without her glasses, and when i saw her with those leather pants and heels. She made a real stiff out of herself. I mean she was completely awkward. Battling most of the creatures past made a big difference in this sequel. And seeing the past criminals was also interesting as well. And all this time, the gang were tailing the wrong man throughout the movie, and Heather(Alicia Silverstone) was a shady character as well, trying to smear the Mystery Inc. gang. Shame on you! Although she was fake. The music number was flawless, Ruben Studdard of ""American Idol"" do the old Earth, Wind,& Fire's ""Shining Star"" which everyone really put on a show. And I think it what makes this movie better than the first. I think its time to start bashing the critics about the movie, it's one of my favorite cartoons, and I'll enjoy it from time to time. But I hope there's no chance for a third one. If there is one, make sure no one hogs the screen light like Lillard did! Rating 2.5 out of 5 stars!",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
30,generationofswine,An Honest Review,6,1 April 2017,"It is slightly better than the first movie.However, it falls victim to the exact same problems, it tries too had to be a cartoon and, as a result, fails to be a live action movie.It tries too hard to be a cartoon that it forgets where the humor behind Scooby Doo comes from.And it plummets to the annoying just as fast as the first movie did. Like the first one, it transforms itself into a monstrous Scrappy Doo guaranteed to be hated by fans for just as long.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
31,kevin_robbins,This is a step down from the first film in terms of storyline and overall film but a huge step up in terms of special effects and monsters,7,13 October 2021,"Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004) is a movie my daughter and I recently watched together on HBOMAX. The storyline involves the gang attending a crime museum opening when a villain appears and releases several of the gang historical nemesis'. Meanwhile an evil scientist has created formulas that create monsters. How does all of this tie together? This movie is directed by Raja Gosnell (Big Moma's House) and stars Freddie Prinze Jr (I Know What You Did Last Summer), Sarah Michelle Gellar (Cruel Intentions), Matthew Lillard (Scream), Linda Cardellini (Broke Back Mountain), Seth Green (Robot Chicken), Peter Boyle (Red Heat) and Alicia Silverstone (Clueless). The special effects, CGI and atmosphere of this film is absolutely perfect for the content. The storyline is okay, and the writing for the characters other than Scooby and Shaggy is pretty mediocre; however, Scooby and Shaggy are hilarious and well written and delivered. The casting is well selected and fit the characters to perfection and the attire remains well selected. Overall this is a step down from the first film in terms of storyline and overall film but a huge step up in terms of special effects and monsters. I would score this a 6.5/10 and recommend it as a fun family film.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
32,dee.reid,A brief review,5,30 October 2005,"""Scooby-Doo,"" the canine detective who was the creation of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera during the 1970s, was and still is a childhood favorite; unfortunately for us, the audiences of 2005, this isn't the same with the movies. So far, the 2002 live-action adaptation and its sequel ""Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed"" (2004), both directed by Raja Gosnell, have been pretty mediocre.But one thing has remained consistent: they retain the camp humor and self-referential attitude of the original cartoons from the '70s. How's that for animation loyalty? While remaining more praised for its camp much rather than any industriousness, the films, like the cartoons themselves, are still watchable - somewhat.Doo himself looks just how he did in the cartoon, and has the junk-food and Scooby Snack appetite down pat. This time the gang - Fred (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Velma (Linda Cardelleni), and Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) - are back in form again, somewhat. In this sequel, they are investigating strange things going on at a newly opened museum. With the aid of a geek (Seth Green) and a reporter (Alicia Silverstone), they go about solving another ghostly mystery.Acting and good script writing were never admirable qualities of the original ""Scooby-Doo"" cartoons and here it's no different. It's painfully mediocre and the jokes are so-so. But Lillard, as the ambiguously stoner Shaggy, seems perfectly cast, as well as Cardellini as Velma.Bottom line, watch only if you are a die-hard for this sort of stuff.6/10",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
33,GiraffeDoor,I so love Velma...,7,11 May 2020,"People aren't optimistic about live action versions of classic cartoons. And even less so for their sequels.I liked the first one (despite everything) and I enjoyed re-watching this as part of the same trip. It's a fairly well thought through story with a good deal of mystery and the humour works more often than it doesn't.I really wanted to see Cardelli's Velma one more time and I got it. She is so adorable and yet still so cool.If you can manage any patience for this kind of movie at all, then you could do so much worse than this.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
34,Fluke_Skywalker,Doesn't scare up many laughs,4,28 March 2015,"'Monsters Unleashed' is certainly an accurate description of this second live-action Scooby-Doo flick. Unfortunately, though it features much better F/X work, more ""star"" power (Seth Green, Alicia Silverstone and an under/misused Peter Boyle), a better handle on the characters by the returning cast (though none come close to matching the sheer brilliance of Matthew Lillard's Shaggy) and a story that makes good use of iconic baddies from the original animated series, it still only adds up to a marginal improvement over the first film.Little ones may enjoy the loud and zany antics, and Gen-Xers will surely get some nostalgia from seeing the various old school ghouls, but there's little here to recommend for anyone else.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
35,davispittman,Not as good as original.......,6,24 November 2015,"This movie was pretty good....... Certainly not great. I enjoyed the original Scooby Doo from 2002 better than this sequel though. This movie has the same actors playing the same characters as last time, and like last time, they fit their roles perfectly, and do a good job portraying them. I enjoyed the movie's plot and action, both were great fun to watch. This movie explores the characters a little more, especially shaggy and Scooby, so that was nice to see. The effects were pretty good, not incredible, but not cheep. This movie did give Velma a love interest which is good, I kinda wish it would've been a different actor to play his character, but he wasn't awful. Alicia Silverstone does well with her material as well, I liked seeing her in the movie, I enjoyed her performance. So overall, not as good as the first one, but not bad, and for the most part, family friendly. 6/10 for Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
36,questl-18592,Scooby 2,5,15 September 2020,"No amount of cast perfection and chemistry can keep this from suffering intense sequel-itis. Is everything great about the first movie, ramped up and overblown with an effort to try and one up the original only to feel horribly forced and hollow to me.Shallow and frustrating as it may be, there's still some fun here because this cast really is incredible. On strength of the cast alone this is worth checking out if you enjoyed the first one. It's not awful, just bloated and overdone, so you should still have a bit of fun.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

Matthew Lilllard, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Linda Cardellini and Freddy Prinze Jr. are all once again perfect and Seth Green is great. The CG is slightly better than it's predecessor but still weak. Raja Gosnell's direction is really good, it's well filmed and extremely well paced. The soundtrack is also really good and the music by David Newman is good.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
38,lemon_magic,"Still watchable, but if the quality continues to drop, SD 3 won't be",5,15 May 2005,"OK, I was one of the people who thought the original live action 'Scooby Doo' was going to bite big time. I was pleasantly surprised by the results - the movie was smart, self-aware, funny when it meant to be. It even had a little bit of emotional resonance. And the four main actors really did a splendid job of inhabiting their characters, especially Matthew Lillard as Shaggy.This time around, though, the bloom is off the rose.The timing on the funny parts isn't quite as good. Prinz and Gellar seem to be phoning in their parts. Even Lillard isn't quite as enjoyable.Part of the problem is that this 2nd movie seems to have 'forgotten' some of the emotional growth provided for Velma and Daphne in the original- they both seem to be back to Square One. And I know that Shaggy and Scooby are not supposed to be the brightest bulbs in the chandelier, but this time around, they are written as ADD-addled idiots. That's annoying to me, because the real pleasure of the first movie (lightweight as it was) was watching the characters overcome their limitations and fears, and SD2 acts as if that growth never happened.But there are some pleasures to be had, here and there.Although it irritates the hell out of me to watch Velma act as though her breakthrough in SD1 never happened, Linda Cardellini is still a pleasure to watch. If you actually pay attention, you can see the hot, gorgeous woman acting as a dowdy bookworm; she's incredibly appealing, vulnerable,and sympathetic in nearly every scene she's in. Some of the manic set pieces are well staged and executed, especially the snow-board style chase down the mountain with the 'skeleton men'.And I can't help it: I really like the first dance scene in the villains' disco, where Shaggy turns around and discovers that Scooby has gotten carried away and is dancing (in 'disguise') along with everyone on the dance floor. The animators really pulled this off: for about 15-30 seconds, you can't help but smile at the sheer joy of the character. Then the wig comes off, and we're on to the next bit.As I said, this movie had its moments, but it isn't as good a the first, and the first one wasn't exactly High Art. If Scooby-Doo 3 drops as much again, the results will suck as much as everyone feared in the original.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
39,Rob_Taylor,Scooby Doo: Deadwood 2,6,6 August 2004,"Well, that's what it felt like to me. Seems like Scoob went down to Deadwood and picked himself up a couple of logs. A couple of logs by the name of Prinz and Gellar (aka Fred and Daphne). Talk about useless characters! This pair did nothing of any consequence in the entire film. Perhaps for Scooby Doo 3 the writers will recall that, in the end, the Scooby Doo cartoon was just Shaggy and Scooby and not all the pointless hangers on. Of course, there was Scrappy Doo and Scooby Dumb, but we won't go there.But as for the cast, once again Matthew Lillard excelled as Shaggy and Linda Cardellini was a decent Velma. Scooby was, well Scooby, and pretty well done. In fact, the CGI for once was reasonable.But as for the rest.....It's a shame that the writers didn't have more imagination when they decided to ""re-imagine"" the Daphne character. Because all they've done is re-imagine her as Buffy and it's just retarded. So much is she that, in the future, when you're channel surfing and come across this movie you might not realize its Scooby Doo at all but think you're catching Buffy on a re-run.As for the movie itself I guess its OK if you're a kid. But the charm of the cartoon was that the gang never faced real monsters. It was always someone in a mask. Whilst it was nice to see some of the old characters from the show being given the CGI treatment, the fact that they were now supposed to be real was a little boring.There is some good humour fairly early on but it doesn't last long and the whole thing becomes a somewhat tedious slog to the finish which is made even more dire by the awful attempts to introduce a love interest for Velma and the whole character ""development"" thing pitifully attempted (and failed) for Fred and Daphne. At least the series was over in thirty minutes or so.This sequel is neither worse nor better than the original, just more of the same. Only Shaggy and Scooby keep the film going for adult viewers and as for Gellar and Prinz......well, lets hope the writers remember why its called Scooby Doo next time.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

This movie was even more funnier then the previous one reason being is because I thought the other one was more sinister then funny and if i had to choose one I would choose this one. The best parts were when scooby and shaggy were searching for a clue but they only find junk, the flashback on the professor, the club scene and the final scene where scooby saves the day. Overall good movie and better then the previous one.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
41,MartianOctocretr5,Routine Scooby adventure,6,5 November 2007,"This second episode of the live Scooby adventures is a little better than its predecessor. Probably because the story isn't burdened with the whole soap-opera sub-plot the other one had. Also, it sticks to the approach of the original cartoon series as well: Team finds monsters, monsters chase Scooby and Shaggy, team seeks clues, monsters chase Scooby and Shaggy, Velma discovers the solution, trap set up for monsters, monsters chase Scooby and Shaggy, get caught in trap, true identity of monsters unmasked.The interaction of the Mystery Inc. characters is constructed well. The silly moments are fun for the kids, and the the suspects are all amusing characters. Like the first movie, Linda Cardinelli and Matt Lillard bring Velma and Shaggy to life amazingly well, while Buffy and her hubby are just in tow. Scooby's animation is not bad, and the monsters, taken from the original series, were all designed and utilized extremely well. The story rolls right along, with a pretty decent conclusion for a kid's movie.Silly fluff, but entertaining.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
42,vip_ebriega,'Scooby 2' gets **.,4,23 June 2008,"My Take: A mediocre sequel to a similarly lackluster original. Perhaps the only thing I'm glad about in SCOOBY DOO 2: MONSTERS UNLEASHED, perhaps one of the most inexplicable sequel of 2004, is that it isn't much of the total fiasco the original SCOOBY-DOO was. 2002's SCOOBY-DOO, might I say, was a total mess. Everything, inside and out, is a total disaster, a typical example of what's wrong about commercial film-making. Even under the presence of a delightful Matthew Lilard as Shaggy can't save a movie that pisses on your childhood. Although I never was a fan, I remembered how much I used on tuning in on the original Hanna/Barbara series as kid. And SCOOBY-DOO, in that movie, wasn't anything my childhood was.SCOOBY-DOO 2: MONSTERS UNLEASHED does a much better job, I'm afraid. Everything the original fails, this sequel manages to refill into much better. Still, whilst better than sub-par predecessor, It still ain't much of a good film, per se. While it can be said that our kids got much better, adults will still wonder why anyone still got work in doing these below-average family entertainment excuses. While Lilard still shines as Shaggy, the laughs are dry, there's not much of a plot and everything else is just... blah! The new ""story"" is much faithful to their source however. The original monsters in costumes are back, only they're real this time. Made real by a machine that transforms the costumes into the real thing. Once again, the Mystery Inc. gang of Freddy (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Velma (Linda Cardellini), Shaggy (Lilard) and that mumbling and bumbling CGI Scooby are back in the game trying to solve the case, even after becoming a total embarrassment at the press. Shaggy and Scooby finds themselves responsible for the gang's credibility downfall and decide they change their goofy ways and act as real mystery busters. Whilst Lilard is a delight in doing so, it hardly accounts for much of the things about this film that's bad. Alicia Silverstone co-stars as a sleazy lying reporter while Peter Boyle and Tim Blake Nelson play the ex-men with masks.The premise sticks much closer to home than the bland predecessor, but even so, this film rarely is a decent effort. Tired jokes and forgettable antics doesn't a good movie make. Worthy rental for kids though.Rating: ** out of 5.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
43,gftbiloxi,More Like Overworked Taffy Than Cotton Candy,3,29 March 2005,"The original live action SCOOBY DOO was rather like the cotton candy you buy at the fair: pretty to look at and fun to scarf down. But a little goes a long way, particularly when all the air has been beaten out and it emerges as overworked taffy.Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, and Linda Cardellini repeat the roles of Fred, Daphne, Shaggy, and Velma. Once again, Prinze and Gellar are hardly inspired but at least they play with tremendous energy; once again Lillard and Cardellini are so dead on target that the effect is almost spooky. They are supported by Seth Green, a truly talented actor who gives a very nice performance indeed; unfortunately, Peter Boyle is largely wasted and Alicia Silverstone is, well, Alicia Silverstone.Silverstone aside, the cast might have recreated the lightness of the first film--but once you mix in a story about stolen costumes that come to life, huge sets, wild outfits, a dance number, and a ton of CGI effects they pretty much get lost in the shuffle. It's all about as much fun as a carnival after the crowd has gone and you're left alone with gum on the bottom of your shoe.Kids probably won't notice the shortcomings, and older fans will be glad to see numerous references to the original cartoon series--and to be fair the film does have its moments, largely thanks to Lillard, Cardellini, and Green.

45,aesgaard41,Enjoyable But Fair Sequel,9,6 August 2004,"I loved this movie as much as I enjoyed the first one. The dizzying opening is enough to provoke headaches, but its worst criticism is that its inspired from the worst end of the Scooby spectrum - the ridiculous cartoon parody Scooby became rather than the Gothic masterpiece it was meant to be. Lillard is again excellent although Shaggy now has an identity crisis as well as selective amnesia. Thinking he's not worth anything to the team, he's forgotten he has found important clues in the past. Cardelini's presence still shines through her Velma disguise and Sara is also a gracious presence, but Prinze still falls short playing Fred as a stuck up and short-sighted playboy. Alicia Silverstone is a welcome presence even playing a ""rhymes with witch"" although I had would have preferred a different and much more grand end to her character. Seth Green, however, just sorts of wanders through his scenes though. I big complaint I have as I did with the first movie is that since the Scooby Gang started in the Late Sixties/Early Seventies that they would be in their Forties today. Scooby would be 259 years old (37 in people years). The plot has a lot of fake science and far-fetched magic goes into creating the ghouls from the TV series, but there's not enough images of the classic creatures. I would have preferred to see The Headless Specter, the Giggling Green Ghosts, Ebenezer Crabbe and the No-Face Zombie among others. Continuity and established facts are now out the window as the movie makes up its own history as Aggie Wilkins is now a brunette and  C.L. Magnus is missing his fortune. The Miner '49 can now spew fire, but then it doesn't look the guy from the cartoon. I'm not sure if the bald thing was supposed to be the Creeper or not, and where the heck did Chickenstein and the Cotton Candy Ghost come from? Worst among the plot points is that the Pteradactyl was actually John the Caterer from ""Hang In There, Scooby Doo."" Who the heck is Jacobo? Well, that's creative license for you. The writers can screw up everything they want to make their movie. I just hope Scooby Doo III can live up more to the cartoon series than the first movie did.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

50,Mightyzebra,Not especially good. The first one is slightly better.,4,12 June 2007,"Genre: Slapstick filmed film based on the Scooby Doo series (only MUCH less good). My thoughts: I didn't like this very much. In fact, I think I've only watched the whole of it two or three times, even though we've had it since 2004 on VHS and my brother keeps watching it. Usually, I only watch the beginning, but even that isn't worth spending 25 minutes for really.Basically, I think this is a pretty lousy, boring, incomprehensible sequel and I think that the first is better (only slightly). I don't think there's anything particularly interesting about this film, it is just not really my thing. Actually, I think the fact that Scooby and Shaggy try to be like the rest of the gang is pretty good, but it just isn't QUITE enough to grab my interest. So there.Who I recommend this to: People who liked the original A LOT and people who like slapstick or are completely and utterly addictive eat-sleep-drink to Scooby Doo.What happens: The gang have their own museum just for them  WOW YAAY.

And now that they've done it, they better stop now. And I mean Right Now. 'Monsters Unleashed' is a silly and childish sequel to the even worse 'Scooby Doo' two years ago. The actors (in particual Lillard) try but there isn't much joy to be found in this film. There isn't a lot of anything found in it come to think of it. 'The Gang' are faced with all the monsters they've uncovered over the years, somebody is clearly trying to stop them from doing their job. Now, from minute one on, it is completely clear who that person is, but never mind that. Film rushes through all the obligate scenes (with a good effect or two), makes sure Scooby and Shaggy do some silly stuff (the best parts in the film) and there's some sort of love story and 'being yourself' idea put in as well.

53,Min111,Scooby-Doo in yet another adventure,8,29 April 2018,"I'm a huge fan of Scooby-Doo, and this was a good sequel. I think it's just as good as the first movie, yet it's very different. It would've been a poor sequel had it been similar to the first otherwise it was good. Scooby-Doo is about a gang of five: Daphne, Fred, Scooby, Shaggy and Velma. Everyone's favourite is Scooby who's a dog. It's of no surprise. I also like to say that Alicia Silverstone was in the movie. She's famous for the movie ""Clueless"" in case you're wondering. Her appearance made the movie better. The gang go on another adventure. Like the first, Scooby-Doo 2 has more of the mystery-element to it, and makes it very hard to guess for the viewers. It's unpredictable if that's what you want to know. The monsters were great, and more greater than the previous movie. It's funny. The family will like it. If you enjoyed the first one, it's recommended you see the second one because it was just as entertaining. If I were to watch these movies again, I would try to watch them together. I'm glad a sequel was made because it was worth it. But I do feel a third movie should've been made considering the success of this one as well as the first. It would've been a good trilogy, but either way, it doesn't really matter in all honestly other than the fact that ""Scooby-Doo 2 Monsters Unleashed"" is an excellent film.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
54,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,12 October 2020,"For this sequence, all of the production and actors were kept, and that was very positive for this second adaptation, which this time is more grand than the previous one. This time the group that has a greater challenge when a mysterious masked man shakes the group that ends up in a disaster at a city exhibition becoming the target of criticism from the media and the population, it is up to the group to solve the mystery. Again scripted by James Gunn and directed by Raja Gosnell who evolve in history that manages to be superior to the first in practically everything including the villains who are very good different from the questionable choice of the first film, here we see several references of the animated series with famous monsters like Black Knight, Monster of 10 thousand Wolts, Bubble of Cotton, Frankenstein and Miner of 49. The cast in general is very good and the script manages to be funny and again provides a fun plot with the duo Sausage and Scooby very funny. The special effects are still weak, although they are better than the first.Film seen on October 10, 2020.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

However, I didn't enjoy the second movie as much as the first.  I thought the theme of unmasking, i.e., pretending to be something one isn't, was a bit overdone.  But still, the movie had its good points.  I found the visual effects well done.  And the use of villains from previous ""Scooby-Doo"" cartoon episodes, such as the Black Knight and Captain Cutlass, shows great potential.  I admire that the movie adheres to the spirit of the cartoon this way.

I've watched Scooby cartoons a long time and never heard either of these mentioned ever.Most believable is Shaggy, played very well by Matthew Lillard.And I never knew he had any other name other than Shaggy.Oh, and ""Baby Got Back"" by Sir Mix-A-Lot was never released on 78.I don't care what anyone says, Velma DOES LOOK HOT in her red PVC catsuit.A few good silly connections like when Sarah Michelle Geller was Buffy The Vampire Slayer her cronies were called The Scooby Gang.

I do understand however that could be do to this movie having a lower budget compared to the first one.2.)The jokes in this were def okay but weren't as good and felt forced at random times.3.)The premise in the first one was alot more fun and flowed nicer. In the second I felt it was dry at times.Overall besides this movie is def enjoyable and I personally loved it I just don't see it as massive upgrade over the first.

61,shanfloyd,Better climax.,6,21 May 2006,"After the disappointing effort of the first Scooby-Doo film I wasn't much enthusiastic about this ""Monsters Unleashed"". But to tell the truth this film handled the characters better and the climax more interesting, at least in terms of the identity of the villain. It remained true to the original cartoon storyline in the sense that the character of the villain appeared earlier in the film. The dialogues also got better, though abandoning thick sense of humor was impossible. It failed to develop enough chemistry between the members of the gang, which is in fact faithful to the cartoon where in my opinion the characters are quite one-dimensional.The CGI of Scooby himself has improved only slightly. The monsters could have been designed better, although there are touches of nice imagination e.g. the candy floss monster. The most irritating parts were unnecessary hip-hop dance sequences. Besides such points, Scooby Doo 2 deserves more praise than its prequel.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

63,jpintar,Better than original,6,26 March 2004,"The original Scooby Doo was bad.  It couldn't decide if it was a straight live action version or a parody of Scooby Doo.  That movie had an obnoxious tone to it.  The sequel, however, is better.  The action seems to be moving faster than the original.  There are no fewer than three of the famous foot chases that Scooby Doo is famous for.  The movie doesn't make a lot of sense, but it is going too fast for anybody to notice.  The actors seem more comfortable in their roles this time around, especially Freddie Prinze, Jr. as Fred.  Prinze was incredibly smug in the first movie.  This time he seems to have dialed it down more.  The actors are performing more as a team this time.  These are people who like each other in this movie and not as five individuals.  This is not a great movie, with unnecessary amounts of grotesque humor.  Alicia Silverstone is wasted in a minor role.  Overall, get a free ticket if you can to see in a theatre or rent it on video. 6/10",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

However, after having seen the second film - I wish I would have not been so liberal on the review.I truly did enjoy this film much more! It had the look and feel of the old cartoon. The characters seemed more cartoonish, the plot, the sets, etc.This could very well have been the first film, if not tweaked slightly.

65,kenyae-cagle,I enjoyed re-watching this movie,8,8 August 2017,This movie had a very enjoyable plot and climax with the bad guys coming to life. The actors and actresses did a great job being those cartoon Scooby Doo characters. A lot of the fight scenes were unfortunately obvious to tell there was a stunt double. The sexual jokes I have never realized were in there for adult comedy which made the movie even funnier. The Matthew Lillard being the real shaggy did an excellent job as shaggy and playing the coward in the movie. Watching the CGI with Scooby Doo made me laugh so hard to see all the memories again I never realized all I did not pay attention to with this movie as a child. I loved seeing the scenes with Shaggy and Scooby connecting to be heroes for the first time. Watching Seth Green in this made me enjoy this movie even more because I am a huge Seth Green Fan. I love how this show also promoted the Secular Science group.,Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
66,rcavellero,SCOOBY DELIVERS ON SCOOBY TERMS!,6,26 March 2004,I think anyone giving this film a bad review should not have gone to see. You see these films are tailor made for a specific audience and I'm not saying me per say. Although I did find the film to be somewhat clever and abduntantly cute with some believable dramatics flying around. Like the first one this film is just a lite ball of fluff made to put grins on people's faces adults and children alike.  The film isn't overly intelligent or even clever and the spfx look very cartoonish and anti scary at best but the group's workable friendly chemistry and tehf ilm's underrated ability to have infinite fun gives it a pulse unlikely to be enjoyed by stuck up people in the mood for a much more serious take on scooby doo.  This one picks up as Mystery inc. popularity has skyrocketed and they find themselves ina n upheaval. As all of the ghouls they have arrested in the past come back to hunt themd owna nd destroy the city. In addition to all the hi jinx and supposedly hidden drug references Velma is given a nerdy new love interest in Seth Green and tries to play it sexy.  New dimensions are raised in Daphne and Fred's relationship and their is arch evil reporter played by alicia silverstone and a cameo performance from Ruben Studdard. All in all not a great flick by any means but this Scobby definatly delivers on Scooby terms.,Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

Despite having some enjoyable stuff, I didn't really like Scooby Doo (2002) and that's exactly what I felt about this film, although I did like it a bit more.
I still think that Matthew Lillard is good as Shaggy but aside from him the acting isn't great and besides the gang no character is memourable in the slightest.
The CGI and special effects are still pretty bad but I think they're a little better than in the first Scooby Doo film.

In this second one, the group of strange detectives has to confront itself with success, that procur to the main characters a lot of ambiguous situations. Also the fight with the antagonist is based on the appropriation and use of mass media. It can be taken as a discreet result, especially if we think that's a sequel and that the first movie was quite disappointing. In general, anyway, ""Scooby Doo 2"" isn't truly good film, also for a kids audience.

I was a first generation Scooby fan, watching it every Saturday morning year in and year out in the early 1970s, until Scrappy Doo drove me away. We got to know and care for those characters. Amazingly, they're not here. Who are these people, this redhead, blond and brunette? They're certainly not Daphne, Fred and Velma. Freddie Prinze, Jr. was simply channeling Owen Wilson. Helium-voiced Sarah Michelle Gellar is all wrong for stunning Daphne. And Linda Cardinelli was too whiny to be calm, collected Velma. I'm not even going to ask about all the sudden techno-wizardry and the fighting skills. Not to mention the original Mystery Machine gang NEVER went up against actual ghosts, not even once. They always exposed the ghosts to be a fraud. This wasn't Scooby Doo. It was Ghostbusters meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The only good thing about this movie was Matthew Lillard, who was the only cast member to truly capture the spirit (and voice) of the cartoon character.If you want to see a good kids' monster movie this Halloween, I would suggest ""The Monster Squad"" from 1987 instead. It was a much better and sadly overlooked film.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
76,thomasmitilis1995,SCOOBY.. DOOBY...DO...,5,31 May 2020,"PROS:
~The characterization of our beloved heroes is better distributed here than the first installment. Daphne questions her role in the team although she is more intelligent and dynamic than before (her fight scenes are entertaining). Fred takes more seriously the role of the leader and Vilma thinks that the best way not to be rejected is a change in her personality. Shaggy and Scooby become the unexpected heroes in their attempt to be better detectives and prove that they can be useful in their own way. Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prince Jr., Linda Cardellini and Matthew Lillard are more comfortable with their roles in this second installment (Lillard is born to play Shaggy).
~The film is more closer to the cartoon shows. The design of the monsters is pretty imaginative and it is fantastic that many of them are familiar and bring a connection to the Tv series. Furthermore, the whole 'unmask the masked figure' is played beautifully and along with the chase scenes make you realize why these characters are unforgettable.
~There are many delightful segments that make you chuckle. The tranformation of Shaggy and Scooby into a muscular guy and the Tazmanian Devil respectively, their dancing sequence and the scene with the fans of every member are very funny segments. Furthermore, there are some details that give the movie meta vibes such as the T-shirt of Daphne with herself. As a result it is expected from viewers not to take this film seriously but instead as a guilty pleasure.
~The movie makes a criticism about the way the media pesents some news. It is so easy for someone in one moment to be glorified and in the next to gain a bad reputation. In other words, it is a usual phenomenon a statement to be misrepresented for the interest of someone else.
CONS:
~The slapstick humor exists to an exhausting extent indicating a desperation for cheap laughs. Moreover, the fart jokes are far too many and annoying.
~The secondary characters are wasted here. Tim Blake Nelson and Peter Boyle have small screen time and their past could be explored better. Alicia Silverstone is... well Alicia Silverstone and despite the revelation in the end about her character, she offers nothing special to the film. In addition, Seth Green's character is only used as a romantic sidekick for Vilma and the movie fails to trick us into thinking that he is the bad guy.
~Although the CGI of Scoob is improved over the fist movie, the effects are sloppy again. This has a negative effect on the film considering the fact that this time the story is completely based on the presence of big monsters.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

And I HATED Scrappy Doo!Now on to Scooby Doo 2:Being a huge fan of the animated series, I wish they had stuck a bit closer to the character appearances (Fred's hair and voice, Velma's attempt at femininity, Scooby's whole body). In addition I didn't like the ""Mystery Machine Limo"" that cameo'd in the opening scene, or their ultra cool hipster clubhouse-hideout loaded with expensive gadgets. I haven't seen every single episode of the cartoon, but I don't remember them having a ""clubhouse"" at all. Didn't they just cruise around in their van all the time?But these complaints are small things that I can accept and overlook in view of the ""bigger picture"" which is: the story; the effects; and the delivery (acting and directing) of the presentation.On these merits, the movie scored very well! Director Raja did an especially decent job sticking to the visual and storytelling style of the animated series: There were at least three of the infamous Scooby-trademarked chase-scenes; two scenes where Shaggy and Scooby royally screw things up; Shag and Scoob eating ten times their weight in junkfood; the typical ""bait and switch"" technique in finding out who the baddie was; and NO Scrappy Doo! (Yes!!)The monsters were all taken directly from episodes of the cartoon. Their realization on the ""big screen"" was exceptional in every case.The special effects - while not ""Oscar-worthy"" - were very well done. The opening-credits scene alone (where you follow a pterodactyl flying it's way through a maze of alleys and back-streets to the museum where we meet the ""gang"") is worth the admission price!Go see it if you like the cartoon series AND are open minded enough to accept some lewd humor (fart jokes, puking, and the like) and some slight character differences from the cartoon.My 7 year-old son loved it too and was quoting some of the funnier lines as we walked to the car after it ended.I gave it 7 out of 10 which is about the most a movie like this could possibly expect for a rating.

The acting seems mediocre to me in this film and the CGI Scooby Doo looks faker than ever.  The movie starts off on a promising note but it all goes down hill right after the masked mans first appearance. Honestly, I don't know how you can not figure out the identity of the villain behind it, and they had to throw in an extra twist in the end which only made it worse in my estimation.Sarah Michelle Gellar seems out of place and so does Freddy Prize Jr along with Alicia Silverstone. Let's just put it this way, I actually feel SORRY for these guys having wasted their talent on this junk.SPOILERI thought it was friggin stupid to have Heather actually be Dr. Jacobo in disguise, who was also the masked man. That was the dumbest ending I have seen. To me, it would have been so much cooler if Heather was Jacobo's girlfriend instead or had some other vendetta against Mystery Inc.

If this had been the first film, I think that many would have thought it was much better, but, when you weigh it against the original 'Scooby Doo' movie, it pales....  We still have the cast of ""Mysteries Inc"" running around in the Mystery Machine van - with Scooby Doo (created in CGI), Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Shaggy (Matthew Lillard), Velma (Linda Cardinelli) and Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar).  This time, they're joined by some old favorites: Seth Green (as a love interest for Velma), Peter Boyle (as the classic 'Old Man Wickles'), Alicia Silverstone (as a great foil for Daphne), 'Inside Edition' host Pat O'Brien shows up and even 'American Idol' alum Ruben Studdard gets a turn to show us his acting chops.The story line revolves around a reappearance of some of Mystery Inc.'s old school monsters coming back around in town.  Alicia Silverstone plays a hard charging, up and coming news caster, trying to get the next big story - and she doesn't care who she crushes in her way up.  Seth Green shows up as a curator of a museum to the greatness of Mystery Inc., and cares for all of the monsters that they've caught.  It's HIS museum that gets robbed and the monsters come back to life!The CGI here is just as good as the first time - but there seems to be a bit more of it....

There's a lot of flash and sizzle to this film, but it's more like a diet version of the first...  still not bad, but sometimes leaving you wanting for just another bite!",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
84,KnightLander,Not really the highlight of the actors' careers ...,4,20 June 2005,"With the success of the inevitable success of the first Scooby-Doo, it was predictable a sequel would follow. Unpredictably, however, the sequel is better than the original.The film begins with the gang attending the opening of a museum featuring the costumes of Mystery Inc.'s old enemies. The opening is soon shattered when one of the costumes comes to life and begins destroying the exhibit. To add to the ruination of the museum opening, the Gang's reputation soon begins spiraling downwards. It's up to frustrated Fed, doubtful Daphne, love-filled Velma and disheartened Shaggy and Scooby to save the day - and Mystery Inc.! I myself had seen low ratings for the film, and therefor hadn't much interest in seeing it. The family went, though, and so did I. As the film began, I was expecting a film pretty much like the first, possibly slightly worse. As it turns out, Scooby-Doo 2 is the opposite of that.The part of the film I enjoyed the most was Matthew Lillard's performance as Shaggy (he also stole my attention in the original movie). Lillard is perfect and frequently funny. The animated Scooby-Doo is particularly enjoyable as well; bite me if you will, but I found the ""Conclusion: Bunny"" sequence pretty funny.The rest of the cast is fine, although SD2 is probably not the highest point in their careers. I found Sarah Michelle Gellar's rendition of Daphne boring - and I'm a SMG fan! The humor was pretty low, and generally unfunny, although the film does have its moments. The direction is fine, and the special effects are pleasing. The creatures will be enjoyed by the younger audience.Speaking of younger audience, SD2 is clearly aimed at a younger age range than the first film. The soundtrack was fine, and David Newman's score was very nice. It created a mysterious and kookily fun mood for the film.Is Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed better than the original film? In some ways, yes. It has more entertainment value, that's for sure. Will kids like it? Yes, they'll definitely like more than the first. But will you like it? That's something only you can answer.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

86,shulmanator,A fun kid's film!,6,16 September 2004,"Yeah, I know it's not the best film in the world, and it may be very commercially driven, but it's WAY better than the first film. This is what the first film should have been, if not better. There's no Scrappy Doo ruining it for fans. There's better soundtrack songs plugged into the film.Better character focus, although there's too many ""violin scenes"". There's much more nostalgia for the fans, as the original monsters are in it this time.Fred was an appendix in the first film. This time he actually brings some entertainment and purpose with him.Daphne's action scenes are more suited this time around, and the action has a little suspense this time.Linda Cardellini's performance is perfect as Velma. She's the female Clark Kent.Shaggy and Scooby have never been more buddy-buddy.There's plenty of color and silly monsters to go around, so the kids with short attention spans will have plenty to pacify them.

87,lea-1,"Mysteries and monsters, that's what Scooby Doo 2 is all about",10,21 March 2004,"I have just returned from having seen Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed in a packed theatre, not a single seat left empty. Families with kids from toddler to teen populated the dark interior. There were some moments during the movie when I cringed, expecting to hear the frightened shrieks of the younger, more sensitive members of the audience but was relieved to hear not one single cry, not even when the sound effects got loud, not even when I jumped a couple of times at the unexpected.The quick (and correct) plot summary is: Mystery, Inc. has donated costumes to the Coolsonian Criminology Museum.  These costumes were worn by the various schemers and crooks over the years that Mystery, Inc. has unmasked when solving assorted mysteries.  Someone has devised a way of creating real monsters by using these costumes and a substance called randomonium and that same someone is determined to completely destroy Mystery, Inc. and Coolsville with these new monsters.There were some really cool moments in this movie, the Pterodactyl ghost flying away with the Evil Masked Figure was pretty awesome, Shaggy and Scooby playing with chemical potions was very funny, Seth Green is very funny as the museum curator. There are the pre-requisite fart jokes but they are funnier than what was in the first Scooby Doo movie, the theatre laughed hard at one scene involving Miner 49er during his unfortunate encounter with Shaggy and a nervously gassy Scooby. In fact, most everything about Scooby Doo 2 is better, funnier, cleaner and smarter than the first one.  There were a few scenes that felt a little clumsy, Fred being masculine, Daphne being Buffy-ish and Scooby dancing makes three.  For some reason the Black Knight Ghost was given a lot of dialogue, unfortunately you can't understand a single word except his last sentence, which happens to be a bad pun. The other ghosts are mostly, and appropriately, monosyllabic, as were their cartoon forerunners.The special effects are seamless right from the beginning, the Pterodactyl-eye view of Vancouver, BC as Coolsville is stunning. The shimmer effects with the ghosts is very cool, the bright and vibrant colors lend to the completely fantastical vision of this fantastically fictional place inhabited by the most normal looking oddballs one could imagine.  This time around, Matthew Lillard, (there is no better Shaggy), gets to play more with Scooby. Linda Cardellini still has the Velma vibe going and Neil Fanning is the Scooby voice master.  Sadly, Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar still do not understand who Fred and Daphne are or what they are about. It's distracting to see preppie Fred turned into a valley/skaterboy and I do not remember Daphne being so vapid and self-involved.  Peter Boyle makes a perfect Old Man Wickles, cranky and completely bothered by the very existence of Mystery, Inc., Tim Blake Nelson in his brief appearances as Jacobo looks completely crazed. Alicia Silverstone was adept as a TV reporter who apparently has a bit of a grudge against Daphne.  That leaves the stars of this movie, the monsters, most of which are CGI and voiced by experienced voice actors in the usual cartoon manner, but four of the ghosts are actually humans inside elaborate costumes. They did an excellent job of acting through the layers of prosthetic makeup, costuming and physical absence of their CGI screen mates. The added effects of glowing randomonium and varying degrees of transparency combined with complete obedience to their leader, the Evil Masked Figure, made the danger to the inhabitants of Coolsville apparent.The sets, costumes, music, sound effects, visual effects, it all works to transfer the small-screen cartoon to the big screen in live action. For Game Boy Advance players, stay until after the very last name in the credits has rolled to see what Scooby Doo has just for you.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
88,mrusty5,Better than the first film.,10,12 September 2008,"For the first film, I was a little disappointed. Mostly because the plot was a bit out of whack, the characters were nothing like their cartoon counterparts and the ending revelations were silly. I found the second film on DVD and decided to buy it. I watched it and loved it.The second film is a great deal better than the first film and more faithful to the cartoons, in fact, that's what it feels like - watching a feature length live-action episode of the show. The actors portrayals of Mystery Inc. have greatly improved and they seem more comfortable in their roles. The sets, stunts and special effects (a phrase taken from the bonus features on the DVD) were all well put together, adding to the fun.Monsters Unleashed involves Mystery Inc. in their hometown of Coolsville, attending the opening of the Coolsonian Criminology Museum, where the costumes of monsters the gang faced in the cartoon are on display. However, the Evil Masked Figure attacks, stealing the costumes and transforming them into realistic-looking monsters who all seek revenge on Mystery Inc. However to make matters worse, a trash-talking news reporter Heather Jasper Howe berates the gang and turns the city against them. Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby Doo must fight and run for survival and regain the confidence of Coolsville.The portrayal of Fred and Daphne are greatly improved and a lot more funnier than in the first film where they were greatly out of character. Velma is generally the same as before, but the presence of a romantic interest for her is a new side to her. As for Shaggy and Scooby, they are hilarious and really emotional.It was really great to see a lot of references to the classic shows. The monsters are all accurate to their cartoon versions with some changes to make them look realistic. Among the monsters are the ghostly Black Knight, the electrifying 10,000 Volt Ghost, the vicious Pterodactyl Ghost who steals the monster costumes, the comical duo of the Skeleton Men, Captain Cutler who is a deceased deep sea diver with a glowing helmet, gargantuan fire-breathing Miner 49er, boggle-eyed Zombie who covers an unfortunate news reporter in slime, the massive blob that is the Tar Monster, and the Cotton Candy Glob who meets his end by Shaggy and Scooby's stomachs. Other monster costumes appear, heavily similar to their cartoons forms.I recommend this film is anyone who likes Scooby Doo as it is really fun and enjoyable. Although there are some swear words used, a couple of scary images (and disturbing ones too), and Scooby Doo wearing an afro and dancing for a little while, this film is colourful and memorable experience to watch.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
89,splundy61,"It's A Silly Movie, But...",10,18 November 2021,"...so was the original cartoon series, & I loved every episode! An improvement over it's dismal predecessor, what we have here, to my delight, is a 90 minute Scooby Doo episode. Nothing beats the original series, but this is the best of the Scooby Doo movies! Treat yourself, be a kid at heart & enjoy!",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
90,pbrugalett,Getting back to their cartoon roots,8,27 March 2004,"While checking director Raja Gosnell's (`Scooby-Doo 1 and 2') resume I learned he had been editor of the little known comedy-horror classic, Troma's 1987 `Monster in the Closet.' So before I go on, forget what you think you know about Troma films to find and rent `Monster in the Closet.'. Meanwhile, in this second `Scooby Gang' installment we find our five heroes (Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred, Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne, Linda Cardellini as Velma, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy, and Scooby Do) getting back to their cartoon roots when a mysterious masked madman brings a collection of monster costumes (worn by previous Scooby-Doo cartoon bad-guys) to life to terrorize the town of Coolville, home of the Mystery Machine. Someone on the last film's production team  must have read the reviews of `Scooby-Doo 1' and listened because  `Scooby-Doo 2'  follows the cartoon formula that gave the television series it's signature style. Back are the locations we've come to expect: an abandoned, condemned mining camp; a desolate, decaying, haunted mansion, and a spooky, foggy swamp. And, as in the cartoons, our gang needs to unmask-unmask (if you're a fan of the cartoon you understand otherwise wait to see the film) the madman behind this who-can-it-be mystery, while Shaggy and Scooby try to prove to themselves that they too are heroes. Don't expect a work of art, but do expect lots of cartoon comedy, fart jokes, whacky chase scenes, and a few lines and scenes thrown in for the adults. One of my favorites was at the opening of the museum exhibit when the Scoobys walk the red carpet. Various groupies attached to each of the heroes greets them and, of course, the group that greets Shaggy is definitely stoned. The monsters unleashed are more funny than scary, which makes this a good intro to horror for little ones. (We need to start raising the next generation of horror fans.) They even added some depth to this cast with Seth Green (Austin Powers and Buffy the Vampire Slayer) as the museum curator; Alicia Silverstone (Batman and Robin, The Baby Sitter) as the Reporter; and the great character actor, Peter Boyle as Old Man Wickles. Fans of the Scooby-Doo cartoon series will certainly enjoy this film while others will get some cheap belly laughs.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
91,chasman99,Only for the kids,6,30 March 2004,"I recall going to see the Brady Bunch movie, longing to relive my days as a young kid.  It worked, and was so hilarious I was waiting for the second one to come out for sure.With Scooby Doo things are different.  I have kids and wasn't all that pleased with the first one.  As time moves along and I watch SD1, it is tolerable and campy enough that it reminds me of my days watching the cartoon.SD2 fails miserably for me however.The negatives are: Daphne: Sarah Michelle Gellar couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, and Daphne has been ruined.  Sure she was the ""hot chick"" and internet jokes have always pitted her and Fred together, but in the show she was also intelligent and a believable mystery solver.  In the movie, we don't know if she's a pin up doll or wanna be scholar who gets lucky from time to time. I also never knew she was Jackie Chan!Fred:  Sorry Freddie Prinz, you can't act either (see paper bag reference to Daphne).  Like Daphne Fred is lost.  Again, he was the ascot wearing good looking fella, but remember this was the 70s.  So to make him more modern and hip is just wrong.  The whole be yourself theme is just plain goofy, and he and SMG have ZERO chemistry.Overall story was not true to the cartoon.  Underneath the ghosts and chases was a totally horrific ""be yourself"" message.  If I wanted that I'd rent a John Hughes movie.  For Scooby Doo, I want goofy chases and gaffes, and lots of food consumption.The good:Matthew Lillard, again.  He IS Shaggy, and shockingly has a real place in Hollywood as a decent character actor in films.  He's rarely going to steal a scene but he always seems to pull off his characters exactly as he should.Peter Boyle was fabulous, the monsters were totally cool and Seth Green was excellent.  You never quite knew if you could trust him, and that is a credit to how he played his character.All in all, it was not true to the Scooby Doo feel and theme, so it was disappointing.  One note though.  I have a 6 year old and a 3 year old. They both really enjoyed the movie.  The ghosts can be scary for some kids who aren't very aware of what is fake and what is real.  I'm lucky in that regard.  They got a real kick out of the movie and yes, the fart jokes.For the kids, I say , yes.  Go see it.  If you are looking to relive some old time fun, watch cartoon network or something.The final thing that makes this movie livable, is no Scrappy Doo.  He had his place and we poked fun, but thank you for not bringing him back!",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
92,Uxbridge,Mind numbing,2,30 July 2004,"Loved the cartoon as a kid. Big, stupid dog with 4 dorky kids investigating spooky things. It works when you're 7 because you don't know any better. I went to this film with my niece and fell asleep. That didn't happen in Shrek or Shrek 2 (which were both funny and entertaining, unlike this junk). Cardellini, Lillard, Prinze and Gellar all good actors stuck with an asinine storyline that's neither fun nor funny. It's like some made for the Disney channel movie that happened to have the good fortune to be released in theatres to make a bit of cash. If you truely in need of a fix of amusing family type movie, see Shrek 2 again. This dud was a waste of time.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
93,Avoura,Fun and enjoyable film,6,10 March 2005,"This was not quite as good as the first film, but still worth watching.In this film we see some super villain bringing to life various old ""ghosts"" from the cartoon series using a special formula that creates life out of nothing. Plot is not as great as the first Scooby Doo movie, but the acting is very good, so are the special effects and costumes. I think the idea of the past enemies of Mystery Inc all being at a party which is then crashed by Shaggy and Scooby was good and well made.I think this film had more of a feel of being for the kids than the first film, but I enjoyed it anyway.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
94,nicver,It's not that bad,5,6 April 2004,"I took my daughters to see it and I have to say it was nice family fun. Old fans of the series will recognize some of the monsters from the very first seasons. Just as in the first episode, it goes against the rule that everything has a rational explanation. Supernatural forces are yet again called to animate the bad guys.The story is not that bad, the animation and special effects are a bit too much for little ones to follow, but they all seemed to have a blast.The acting is the bad point. It seems these actors are tired of the franchise already and seemed to be tied by a contract for at least one more episode. And you can tell they are bored. Plus they look awful and tired! Only Lillard makes an effort.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
95,moviefan69,Surprisingly good family fun.,8,27 March 2004,"When it comes to deciding what movies to see, critics are the last ones you should listen too. Why? Because they are all so concerned about the construction of a film, that they no longer know how to have fun with them. This is especially true when it comes to family movies. Not every movie can be The Lion King or Finding Nemo. Nor should they be expected to be. Family movies should be one thing, and one thing alone...fun. Scooby Doo 2 delivers this and then some. I thought the first film was barely mediocre, so I had very low expectations walking in to this one. I went only because my children loved the original and were excited to see this one, and I wanted to see them have a good time. What I didn't expect was to actually like the movie myself. The sequel far outdoes the original. There are several reasons for this. First off, the cast has become comfortable with their roles. In the first movie, only Matthew Lillard appeared to be having any fun, and his dead-on performance as Shaggy proved it. Here all the remaining cast has lightened up and joined in. So the performances are good all around. Secondly, the special effects are much improved. Scooby blends in more seamlessly even though you know he's CGI. There is an incredible shot of a ghostly pirate ship emerging from behind the buildings of the dowtown city that is amazing, and very reminicent of the Stay-Puft marshmallow man from Ghostbusters. Third, as a fan of the cartoons growing up, this one looks more like true Scooby Doo. In the first movie, the monsters were not very interesting. But here, to see so many of the classic animated monsters brought to life, was a thrill. Critics have made the complaint that it's too ""cartoonish"". Um, hello? It's based on a cartoon! What were you expecting? The movie is also very funny, although it does rely on fart jokes one too many times. Plus anyone over the age of 5 will figure out the villian's secret identity 10 minutes into the movie. But all in all, this is exciting family fun. Family movies exist soley for families to have a good time at the movies. This is definately a good time for kids of all ages. *** out of ****.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
96,BloomingtonAdam,The cartoon comes to life,8,10 April 2004,"On the very short list of movie sequels that are better than the original, you will find this movie. It is funny, sweet, and charming all at the same time. As a live action cartoon, it hits the mark perfectly. Not only was it fun to see the cartoon monsters brought to life, it was also fun to see how much the animators enjoyed giving them life. The morality tale of ""always be yourself"" was prevalent throughout, making for a wonderful message. Many people are overly critical of a movie like this, expecting things movies like this aren't meant to deliver. It is pure silly fun and not much more. For those unaware, the kids are blamed as things seem to go wrong in Coolsville. Determined to make things right, they track down the person behind the reappearances of old villains. Shag and Scoob trek out on their own determined to prove they can be good detectives. Down the road the gang meets up learning more about themselves along the way. Through teamwork and perseverence they (of course) get to the bottom of the mystery, unmasking the villain in classic Scooby Doo fashion. I am happy to say I had a completely enjoyable time at this movie, and was pleasantly surprised, as I hadn't expected much going in. In the wide world of moviedom, if you go in expecting Batman <The original with Adam West> instead of The Matrix, you should be in for a treat.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

It is an excellent comedy that I would recommend to everyone. The main reason why this movie was so cool was that it combined so many different genres into one movie. It had action, adventure, mystery, comedy, and family, all combined into one movie. I also like the way that they designed the graphics for Scooby Doo. Last, it was definitely an improvement from the original Scooby Doo movie. I just did not think that the original Scooby Doo was as good, but this Scooby Doo was really interesting. I know it is more for little kids, but the main thing that caught my attention was the comedy in this movie. I guarantee you will thing it is funny.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

And it does'nt work. You should probably ignore Scooby for this entire movie as it is bad CGI and the 3D avatar far froms shows as convincing. However, there are some decent performances by the guy who plays Shaggy very impressively and some others. By far the most impressive thing about this movie are the monsters which have been very very very well done and are sheer fun to experience. Don't go expecting any great story or anything great and just go see it for mindless fun. There's nothing wrong with mindless fun is there?",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
99,WTH_MovieFan,"Ruh Roh, Scooby is Back!",9,27 March 2004,"Well I was excited about getting to see this film being a big fan of Scooby Doo. I liked the first one but it lacked alot of the Scooby elements, with this sequel, I felt like I was watching an actual Scooby Doo cartoon episode with them running around creepy mansions and a town with monsters on the loose. It was also wonderful getting to see some of their old villains come back and I really liked how they played that up.  I agree with what was said in an early user's comment about it getting bad reviews because of the people who are reviewing it, they're basically looking for Oscar nominations not the fun side of things.  I usually tend to enjoy the movies thatget bad reviews the most. I was proud of Sarah Michelle Gellar, she wasnt as annoying as she was in the first. One problem I would have to say I had with them film was there were too many sappy moments where they had to give each other pep talks and tell each other that they are worth something or they'll mope around feeling sorry for themselves, some if it is good to have but it seems they broke off from the action to include one of these scenes.

To a degree that may be true (hey, nothing wrong with making a buck!).That said, this film still contains some items of interest. For the kids, great show, very funny and enjoyable. For those who grew up with the animated series, you will love it. Very true to the original cartoon series with a lot of the same type features and plot devices. For those who are a fan of the ""animated actor"" (I think we can start to use that phrase now to differentiate a character from just a special effect, I mean, what would the LOTR films be without the input of Golum) there are some great scenes of interaction.Another thing to note is that this film is not simply a remake of the first film (as a lot of sequels are), this very much stands on it's own feet. However, I do think that this really should be the last feature film we see of the Scooby characters, I honestly don't think a third one will sustain the momentum that well.Overall - **1/2 stars",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

But I found myself enjoying something a little different, fun and entertaining. I didn't remember seeing Alicia Silverstone in the first one, but that could just be me. I think the cast was great too, they are all the uprising stars you see in movies here and there. Good show, something different and very fun!

102,ian-535,"A highly polished, highly developed sequel",7,14 January 2005,"As sequels go Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed is a good film. It's plot is a highly contrived, and tightly interwoven blend of modern day American youth struggling to combat the pressures and stresses forced upon them by outside influences. In this cinematic production, a great deal of that pressure is forced upon them by the cunning media moguls that closely follow their every move. I believe that this successfully conveys the pressures we can all feel from time to time from ones close to us, like our parents, for example. Teen angst is also explored thoroughly in this film when Velma (the intellectual one of the group) begins to doubt her sexual appeal to the males present in her life, in particular Patrick whom she meets during an exhibition being held at the city's museum.Through adversity Velma battles to forge her place on the plain of existence within the very real world in which she dwells.Shaggy and Scooby are the real centrepieces of the performance. They are ideally placed for illustrating to us all how each of us tries to 'fit in' with society, even though society itself can sometimes not be what we're looking for and can appear both bland and boring. Through these 2 characters alone the director, Raja Gosnell, takes his viewers on a roller-coaster of emotions, including self-doubt, lack of confidence, a wanting to please others and ultimately a triumphant return to form and the adoration and respect of those closest to us in our lives. Something I believe we are all striving for.Scooby Doo 2 justifies the use of modern day cinema as a medium for conveying to us, the public, the difficulties of living and coping in today's world. But, it also shows us that with a little bit of self-belief and the support of others, we can achieve our ultimate goals and be accepted as an individual within society as whole.The special effects rocked too.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
103,kitkat9,So much better than the first (sorry) attempt...,8,7 May 2004,"I am a ""Scooby Doo"" fanatic!! No one was more excited about the live action version back in 2002 than me (although I was looking forward to a Scarborough-esque retelling when Mike Myers was still attached to the project (complete with a Barenaked Ladies cover of the second greatest theme song in television history!!)). I, a 30+ year-old woman, much to the chagrin and delight of my friends/work colleagues, even had a ""Scooby Doo"" countdown.  I bought my nieces and friends (forced to accompany me to what was sure to be the film event of a generation) Scooby-Doo merchandise. Nothing could ruin this moment for me, until I actually saw the film! Needless to say that my utter disappointment in their first attempt (Shaggy is a vegetarian...hello what about all of those salami sandwiches he and Scooby ate in the cartoons!!) didn't put me in a state of readiness for the second offering but my love of that wacky Great Dane and the promise of the superb Seth Green did make me want to see Number 2...a little bit. Well, this time I was not disappointed!  They actually got it right this time!! A tribute rather than a joke at the expensive of long time (and yes over 30!) fans and only one fart joke (and not a bad one at that!)!  It was great to see all the old monsters creatively redone in CGI!  The cast was excellent (ok, it's not Shakespeare but they did a great job with the fantastic, pure camp that they had and it was good, old-fashioned fun camp this time too!).  And yes, Seth Green was amazing as ever (psycho, cute, and lovable all wrapped up in one neat little package!) So, go and see SD2, especially if you didn't like the first one.

106,BIGHAIRY-1,Why?,5,4 May 2004,"After sitting through this turd of a film I began to wonder why?Why have I paid £25.00 to see this? Why is my ass aching? Why am I here? Why was this made? Why aren't there any farting dogs? These were just some of the questions going through my head whilst watching this movie. Scooby Doo The Movie (the first one) worked on a couple levels, namely the farting dog & the excellent Matthew Lillard (he is Shaggy). However in the second film these fun elements are mainly overlooked for cheesy dance scenes, Freddy Prinze Jnr & plot (sorry just kidding about the plot). The afore mentioned plot involves someone bringing to life all of Mystery Inc's most famous foe's & the gang trying to solve the mystery (well there's a suprise). The unmasking of the villain at the end is so obvious that even my 7 year old daughter knew what was coming, and the so called adult nudge nudge wink wink jokes rarely hit the spot. There are however a couple of plus points. Matthew Lillard is again excellent (& under-used) as Shaggy & the gorgeous Linda Cardellini is also very good. The CGI effects are also very impressive & there are a couple of good action set-pieces, the Pteradactyl Ghost chasing the Mystery Machine standing out a mile. Overall this is a movie that only appeals to under 12's. My 3 daughters enjoyed it for the most part, but even my youngest commented that ""Scooby Doo didn't fart very much"". So you see the farting dog did appeal at some level, even if it was at a 32 year old man's & a 3 year old girl's.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

You got to know more of them and their personality. Although this was a great movie, I still liked the first Scooby Doo better. I felt the first one was more creative and fun. I didn't like how Scooby Doo 2 ended (I won't say how) and I thought it was obvious who the villain was. I love both movies. Hopefully there will be a Scooby Doo 3. I know Linda Cardellini and Matthew Lillard are ready to sign on but Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. are having second thoughts. Also, Scooby Doo 2 did have better special effects.

I must have watched it at least 20 times and the (slightly ridiculous) jokes make me laugh every time! especially 'scooby-doo, what's your conclusion?' 'BUNNY!!' The scene at 'The Faux Ghost' is great too, Scooby dancing is something I never thought I would see! It is a well known fact that the first film in a series is always the best, but in this case I think this one is better, as it contains more humour and brilliant cast members, including obsure ones. If you enjoyed the first film there is no doubt you will like this one too, if not more. The unmasking actually surprised me unlike the cartoons which may as well begin with 'WARNING!!! CONTAINS PREDICTABLE CONTENT!!!' Great for all ages.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
110,ChasSaur,"Cool monsters, but that's about it",3,27 March 2004,"For the hard-core Scooby Doo fans, this is an okay movie.  Seeing the various ghosts given a CGI makeover is rather fun....that being said...There was no need for either the ""Scooby and Shaggy must redeem themselves"" or the ""Fred and Daphne have inferiority complexes"" plot lines.  Very little screen time was spent on the actual mystery solving.  There were a few good points, mostly related to creating visual pieces that remind you of the cartoon (exaggerated sneaking, Scooby/Shaggy carrying each other). For the guys, there's the sight of Velma/Linda Cardellini in a red leather catsuit, though not much for Sarah Michelle Gellar fans.  Her one fight scene looks like it was lifted from a Buffy episode.Unless your child or inner-child are clamoring to see the movie (or you want to see the Harry Potter trailer), then you can wait for the video release.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

Visual gags are clever and well-executed. Don't take it too seriously. A hot Velma always works with me. Daphne is cute too. Scooby animation is better than the best cartoon work. It is Scooby antics that help sell this film. Since this is based on a cartoon, don't over-analyze the plot holes, just willingly suspend your disbelief. It made $83 million in the box office. A moderate success, IMO. Lillard saying the box office was disappointing and that's why there will be no Scooby 3 doesn't seem true to me.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

And they are watching both the old and new iterations of the cartoons.
This captures the spirit of the show and will keep the kids entertained. In my case, over and over again.
I am glad Netflix has allowed us to rekindle the flame for some of these movies that were released with old school family entertainement flair in a time where the nostalgia effect didn't line up with the dark movie trend at release.Shaggy and Scooby easily still the show.

It's a shame the cartoon is a classic; the made for TV will only be fit for the trash can.  Save your money, avoid this movie.

It finally happened in a live action Scooby Doo.I didn't like the first ""Live"" Scooby Doo movie, the characters seemed, well, out of character, the plot was all out of whack, though the ending did improve a bit on the story, and the cut scenes on the DVD helped a little.In Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed we have a lot of the elements that made Scooby Doo so memorable. There were music scenes, masked villains, an actual mystery, secret passages, a spooky mansion, humor and some of the lore of the multiple Scooby Doo series.The CGI was better, and the character of Scooby seemed ""more realistic"" when compared to the rest of the cast. Matthew Lilliard and Linda Cardellini were still the best cast as Shaggy and Velma, however Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar greatly improved upon their original performance as Fred and Daphne.Overall, I quite enjoyed Scooby Doo 2, and if you enjoyed the original Scooby Doo cartoons, but felt cheated by the original Scooby Doo live movie, I highly recommend this one.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

I was somewhat pleasantly surprised, but it's nothing above a 5. Scooby Doo fans (like me) who have seen just about every episode of the first few series will love this movie though for it's in-jokes. The rouge gallery is great, we see Old favorites like the Black Knight from ""What a Knight for a Knight"" (The first episode, which is nicely referenced in the movie), Captain Cutler from ""Scooby Doo finds a clue"", they even have the ghost ship. Story and acting is paper thin, and there are alot of UGHH moments. But if your a Scooby doo fan or you have young children, you should see this movie.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

I was not expecting to leave the theater emotionally jolted. I went to have fun and laugh.  And I did.This was a fun movie.  Let's be honest.  Nobody goes to this film to watch Fred, Daphne, or Velma.  We go to watch Shaggy and Scooby.  They are the ones that make us laugh.  They are the ones that take our minds off the real world for a couple hours.  And they did their job.Matthew Lillard becomes Shaggy for the second time.  What he is able to do in this film is incredible.  You forget he is Mr. Lillard because he fully becomes the character he portrays.  That is the highest compliment you can give an actor (minus a 20 million dollar check).Scooby again is a riot.  The writing allows him to remain the lovable character we grew up with as kids.  He alone is worth the price of admission.The story?  Well, I have eaten swiss cheese with less holes in it than the plot.  But, who really cares?  I can watch The Godfather whenever I want a flawless film.  But, The Godfather does not leave me in a better mood after I finish watching it, no matter how great it is.  I saw this movie relax and have a good old time.I am not ashamed to say that my wife and I went to see this together.  We have no children...WE wanted to see it.  And we both enjoyed it very much. It was a pleasant way to spend the evening.  But don't take it from me. Take it from the dozens of small children that were in there, laughing and shrieking through the whole film.

First, I would like to say that whoever did the casting for Scooby Doo deserves a huge raise.  He found the perfect people to play the different roles.  The best fit will have to be Shaggy. This guy was born to play Shaggy.  Something I still don't understand is where did Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar) learn how to fight with the martial arts and learn to fight with weapons.  She never had that power in the cartoons, but that's Hollywood for you.  Anyway, I thought this sequel was better than the first one, mostly because they didn't have a good guy (Scrappy) playing the villian and the plot was pretty good and it still had its humor.  Anyway, thats about all i have to say about this movie. Overall, this was an entertaining movie.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

This movie does keep things light on its feet but lacks the POW that made the first film a much better experience. The original Cast is back which includes Sarah Michelle Gellar, Mattew Lillard, and Freddie Prinze Jr, but the chemistry is gone, and the wow factor is gone as well. The movie tries to incorporate a lot of the bad guys from the earlier cartoons but it does not handle it successfully, and becomes sensory overload after the first twenty minutes of the film.

Freddie prnz is gd, he has appeal, he should stick to not being able to act in proper films. Buffy is buffy no more said. Velma should marry me because shes hot, and she also carries a lot of the action, she didn't get that much air time in the cartoon. shaggy? the guy was annoying before he was shaggy, hes good as shaggy, but should try and up his game, itll be good for the world. the films are just far more colourful than the cartoon, there's no more pastels and muted colours, its all bizarre acid trippy colours, which kids even feel unsettled by. if they take the next film seriously, which i hope they don't even consider, they should approach it from the film point of view, not the franchise point of view, and film outside of nickelodeons facility range. this film should be shot. xx",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

Because, the graphics and effects were awesome in this movie.Also,the actors did a great job on making the movie similar to the animated version. Next, the characters were funny and cheerful just like in the cartoon shows especially Scooby Doo and Shaggy. Third, Vilma,Fred and Daphne were interesting and very serious about their investigations on each case they faced. Overall Scooby Doo 2 was fantastic and surprising since you'll never know who the real monster/bad guy is until the conclusion of the movie.In conclusion, I gave Scooby Doo 2 a 10/10. Thanks to the actors,directors and performers who helped this movie to become possible.Plus, the Mystery Machine vehicle looks authentic and pretty much the same as the ones in the animated shows of Scooby Doo.In addition,it was fun to watch over and over again and without a doubt you wouldn't get bored while watching it.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

The jokes were different, and the character's attitudes very wrong. I am happy to say though, that this movie stuck quite closely to the cartoon series, that I love. There were of course subtle differences, but all in all it stuck to it's purpose:to make a movie based on a cartoon series. Scooby-doo monster's unleashed follows Scooby, and the gang as the Mystery inc. museum opens, and all the monster costumes disappear, it is believed that is the evil person Jonathon Jacoba at first, but he died during an escape attempt from jail.

129,memoryvixen,Good fun for the family,7,28 March 2004,"I went to see ""Scooby Doo 2"" today with my 26 year-old sister, 60 year-old father, and a theater full of kids ranging from 6 to 13 years of age.  And guess what?  We ALL enjoyed it.  This movie isn't ""Hamlet,"" but it's not meant to be.  Remember that it's based on a CHILDREN'S cartoon, so much of the humor is geared towards children, and the little boys sitting in front of me were having a ball!But parent's needn't fear!  The humor might be geared towards the kiddies, but with the exception of some crude toiler humor, there's nothing offensive or unpalatable to your average adult.  I was laughing hysterically more than once!  Everyone really kicked up their funny bones a notch for this one: Freddie Prinze, Jr was hilarious as the shaggily-coifed Freddy, and Sarah Michelle Gellar turned in another great performance as debutante Daphne. Linda Cardellini (Velma) had a very sweet romantic subplot with Seth Green's character, and Seth Green ALWAYS makes a movie ten times better than it would have been without him.  Alicia Silverstone turns in a delighfully hateful performance as a spiteful entertainment reporter out to take down Mystery, Inc.  And the best small part in the film comes from Peter Boyle (of ""Everybody Loves Raymond""), who plays a bitter ex-rival of the Scooby gang.I love Matthew Lillard, but I thought he overplayed Shaggy in this one, letting the character's eccentric ticks and speech patterns get in the way of many of his scenes.  But when he wasn't trying to be deliberately goofy, Lillard turned in a touching performance as Shaggy and Scooby begin to doubt whether they - the perennial ""screw-ups"" of the team - qualify as ""heroes,"" like the rest of the gang.  And he had what was by far the best line in the entire film; it STILL has me laughing!
SHAGGY: This ties as the most terrifying day of my life!VELMA: Ties with what?SHAGGY: Every other freaking day of my life!
The movie was a great day out, and I wish they'd released it during the summer, because it's perfect summer fare.  They gave it enough of the cartoon elements without making it unbelievable, and each of the actors were perfectly in character.  And beyond all that, the movie puts across a tastefully done message that it's important to embrace who you are and love yourself for what makes you YOU.  This is something that kids should NEVER stop hearing, and if they have a good time while hearing it, than all the better.  I give this one a thumbs up!PS - The second funniest scene in the entire film involves Freddy, the Black Knight Ghost, a mock-joust, and Bon Jovi's ""Wanted: Dead or Alive.""  I won't go into detail. You've got to see it to understand. ;) LOL!",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

132,evening_nightshade,A movie for your inner child...,6,15 April 2004,"Sequels mainly fall into two categories: those who surpass the original, and those who fall flat on their faces. To me, Scooby-Doo 2 was neither - it wasn't as good as the first one, but in no way was it a failure. As a fan of the cartoon series since childhood, I felt that the movie achieved its purpose - to entertain.It *was* a funny movie - maybe not hilarious, but I certainly got a few laughs out of it. Some of the gags were predictable, and some collapsed before they even began, but I felt that the good outweighed the bad.
Perhaps the plot was a bit thin (most viewers with any common sense will have sussed out the bad guy long before the end), but it is, after all, a movie based on a children's TV show. It was never going to be the next Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot, nor was there going to be some totally unexpected twist. If you're willing to let your inner child loose in the cinema, you'll enjoy this movie. Otherwise, go see something else.Personally, I loved Linda Cardellini's Velma. Let's face it, the roles in this movie weren't exactly Oscar-worthy performances, but I felt that the characters were better developed, especially Velma. We saw a bit more to Daphne and Shaggy too, but Fred was left pretty much alone. If there is to be a 3rd Scooby-Doo movie, I'd like to see the writers tap into him a bit more. Most of the actors seem to capture the cartoon series characters, but Freddie Prinze Jr. has to go a little further to recreate the Fred I remember.It was nice to see some of the monsters I remembered from the TV series transferred to the big screen. OK, so they weren't even remotely scary, but hey - neither were their cartoon incarnations.Overall, I'd have to give 'Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed' 6/10 - not a bad movie, but not the best I've ever seen. However, if all you want is children's movie that's not too taxing, then this is for you.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

The reasons are that movies like Spiderman 3 aren't that exciting. Whats the plot anyway? Also the first Scooby Doo was a big hit it made more that 50 million dollars. And Scooby Doo is a classic funny cartoon from the 90's. Freddie Prinze Jr, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Linda Cardellini , Matthew Lillard are great actors. I think if they ever make a Scooby Doo 3 they should be included. Freddie Prinze Jr {as Fred} makes a great Fred, although he was too acty. [rating on Freddie as Fred is 8.5] Sarah Michelle Gellar {as Daphne} acted great, except she pretty much acted the same as Buffy. [rating on Sarah as Daphne is 9.5] Linda Cardellini{as Velma} acted great![rating on Linda as Velma is 10]Matthew Lillard{as Shaggy} acted well, but I am sure the director could of found somebody much better.[rating on Matthew as Shaggy is 7.5]The movies {Scooby Doo 1 and 2} were awesome. But Scooby Doo the movie didn't relate to the cartoon series but it was better than the second one. I rate it a 10. Scooby doo 2 pretty much was like the series and I liked it.But I think the perfect title should be Scooby Doo 2: Monsters United. I rate it a 9.5.

SOME other things.So many violent and scary scenes, to be honest, I'm surprised this movie isn't rated M!

140,jlewiskaczor,Bad bad bad,1,12 January 2017,"Scooby Doo 2 is honestly the worst movie in the entire world, and I'm even accounting for Kool Kat. The acting might be straight from a third grade play and every actor in the movie should consider redacting it from their resumes.First off the town that we find ourselves immersed in is named Coolsville, the lamest town ever. The characters in the movie have literally no clue what to do, and the awkward sexually confused Velma is off putting. Plus the overly girly personality of Daphne makes any normal person want to puke. Shaggy has no personality traits other than hungry dumb stoner. Fred is just a archetypal jock. And lastly Scooby Doo is a crappy CG dog that has a voice that reminds one of gurgling diarrhea.The plot of the movie really feels like it is stitched by a two year old, who has sadly been conflicted with cataracts. I seriously have never experienced more pain in my life than when I sat through the first thirty minutes of this movie. At one point to prove that they are ""good detectives"" Shaggy and Scooby do to a villain disco joint where they dress as groovy dudes. Scooby then gets hit on, because somehow the villainous woman can't see through a badly tailored suit and an Afro wig, or does and is attracted to a dog. I'm not sure which is scarier. This movie should never have been approved let alone produced and everyone who is associated with it should hide somewhere in some cave in the Rocky Mountains.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

Although I'm slightly biased for this film (due to the fact that I watched some of the filming in Vancouver and Stanley Park) I believe this movie felt more like an episode of ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You?"" than the first. Characters and plot are greatly developed. This movie was especially brilliant in that the characters and story were able to be more complex all the while it stuck to it's basic roots. Monster/see the gang (exposition) - Masked figure Problem/who's to blame (rising action) - more thefts/ find monster source (climax) - destroy the source/unmask the masked figure (conclusion). The comedy (though dry on a couple jokes) was much better and unexpected at times than the first. My conclusion: Bunny.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

143,burkeaustyn,One of the best kid-friendly movies of the 2000s,10,5 June 2019,"I watched this film so many times as a kid that I had to come here and make an effort to fix these reviews. It's hilarious, and the characters actually have character. Shaggy and scooby have some sad reflecting moments which never come up in any of the other iterations that really developed them as characters, and many of the jokes even land 15 years later. This movie deserves more credit, and James Gunn should have made more family movies because this really shows his potential which he demonstrated again with Gaurdians of the galaxy. This movie wasn't really a 10/10, realistically I'd give it an 8 or so, but these unfair reviews are not a good reflection of the quality of the movie.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed

151,tbenton,Better than the first one!,9,30 March 2004,"Having grown up watching the cartoon, I was disappointed in the original. But this is more like the cartoon and alot better than the first one. I mean, what do you expect? It's a live action cartoon, keep that in mind. This isn't suppose to be social commentary or a ""change the world for the better"" movie. It's about a group of Ghost busters and their dog. If you have kids and find the cartoon entertaining, then this is a great movie to see. If your looking for something other that just good entertainment then go watch something else. I was very disappointed in reviews that blasted the movie. This will be one movie I look forward to seeing again on DVD.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
152,celestial_eve2001,Even Better Than The First One,10,29 March 2004,"If you enjoyed the first one, then you'll love the second one even better!Sarah Michelle Gellar fighting scenes are spectacular! Daphne can kick some major monster butt! I just love her!Fred was okay. I like his new hair cut. Velma is hilarious! I Love the scenes with her and Patrick.As for Shaggy, well where to start? This guy was also freaking hilarious. Matthew Lillard brings Shaggy into real life! His the most believable Scooby Doo character in the movie. His so gosh darn cute, and I swear I love that Shaggy voice. Oh and the part where Scooby and Shaggy ate some dangerous chemicals! Well I won't spoil you, but it was funny as heck.Overall this movie was fantastic! If you have a kid it's a must see! If you don't it's still a must see movie!",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
153,dalylink,Son Loves It,10,22 January 2011,"I'm really reviewing for my son who is 9. The movie has great chase scenes, funny moments and good music. You should see him playing the air guitar to the music and running along with Scooby and Shaggy. He just loves this movie. Very slapstick.From an adult perspective, I appreciate the slapstick as well. While the story may be formulaic, I still like the results. I am still amazed at the match the studio was able to get between the live action actors and the cartoons/voices from the originals cartoons. I also appreciated the Buffy links through Alicia Silverstone, Sarah Michelle Geller, and Seth Green. 7 stars from my view.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
154,complexmind5151,Why the hatin'?,7,29 March 2004,"I don't get all of the hate being spewed on this site about this movie. It was fun to watch animations of Saturday mornings past come to life on the big screen. Watch those old cartoons, and I think you'd agree this was pretty good considering the subject material. It's not like they were adapting Shakespeare. Yes, its cartoony, but thats the way its supposed to be. And if Matthew Lilliard isn't Shaggy, I don't know who is. The characters seem pretty dead on, and it was awesome to see the black knight ghost come to life. Seems like I've seen that old episode at least 100 times. I don't understand the anger. Just watch it and have fun. Be a kid for two hours, its good for you.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
155,angelic_gal01,Mindless entertainment with too many cliches.,4,21 March 2004,"I saw Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed this weekend at an advanced screening. I never saw the first one because of the bad reviews it received, but given the opportunity at hand, I was willing to give this one a shot.The storyline itself proved to be rather unimaginative. The movie's plot lines have been used so many times before that they have become  boring and meaningless, and the viewer is left in a dull slump, only occasionally coming out of it to chuckle at the movie's more humorous points.I will give Scooby Doo 2 that much; there were some funny moments. I won't mention them specifically, but some of the jokes got the whole theater laughing. They seemed to generally be done in the same style as the cartoon, although I admit I have never actually laughed at a Scooby Doo episode.
However, this was exactly the problem with the movie. If it had maintained a consistently light-hearted mood throughout, it would have been much more effective and entertaining. However, because of it's bad transitioning between humor, romance, and drama, it failed to work. The humor made the movie's attempts at drama and romance fall flat and come off as seeming desperate and stupid. I remember cringing a lot; especially during the final scenes of the movie.The special effects were less than stunning. The monsters were not very scary, which is disappointing considering that, you know, they're monsters. Additionally, most everything looked very fake and rushed. Of course, it's not reasonable to expect fantastic CGI and other effects in a movie of this type, but there was quite a lot to be desired.Overall, I give Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed one and a half stars. My advice is that if you've  got nothing to do one day and a few extra bucks on hand, go ahead and see it. Otherwise, don't waste your time.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
156,earlebob,Kids Loved It,7,1 April 2004,"We took our children to see this, and although it was an okay movie for my husband and self, the kids were absolutely rolling in the aisles. Our 7 year old was hysterical throughout most of the movie.  We liked that it contained the monsters from the cartoons, especially one of my favorites the Black Knight. The plot was cheesy, but let's face it, aren't the cartoons the same?! Our 3 year old sat through the entire film without squirming around and this says that it truly can hold its own as far as a family film is concerned.  I hate to say that one thing that disappointed me was that there was no sign of a Scooby Snack that I could tell. (I might have missed it, since I was shushing the kids.) I like the new updated looks and the fact that they are not playing Velma as being a lesbian. In fact, most will see a truly new Velma. Matt Lillard is an excellent Shaggy! All in all I will say that we were glad that we went.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
157,ello-poppet,loved just like the cartoon *spoilers*,10,30 September 2004,"I love the Scooby doo cartoons and I think this movie was great. The first Scooby movie was great to but this one is more like the cartoons.I think Matthew Lilliard is a great Shaggy and Linda Cardellini is a great actress who did really well playing Velma. Freddie Prince Jr has a good look for Fred but his acting isn't great and Sarah Michelle Gellar is wrong for Daphne bring back the pathetic Daphne in the cartoon that always needs to be rescued. Seth Green as Patrick is great it was so sad when you think he is the bad guy and he and Velma are really cute together.I love the way this movie ties back to the cartoons with the same monsters. I also like this one because it has the unmasking of the villain at the end just like in the cartoons.Those little skeleton Guys are really cute and the other monsters are great to the cotton candy glob was great.The animation for Scooby Doo is great way better than bits in Lord of the Rings. Old man Wickles is great I love his house and when Scooby and Shaggy are hiding in the bushes and he says ""darn bushes howling at me again"" that is great one of the best lines.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
158,milletary,Great for kids,10,27 March 2005,"My daughter loves it and that's all that matters to me. She watches this movie as well as the first one over and over. Slight adult sense of humor for the grown-ups watching the continuous kid loop. Scooby Doo connoisseur's also commend it's true representation of the cartoon. From what I remember they're right. Mysteries are on par with original episodes with a nice spice of originality. Movie is well filmed using bright colors and appealing personalities. All actors and actresses do a wonderful job of playing the characters, emulating voices and overall presence. The two that really stand out are Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini, they are outstanding! The others are good too, but Matthew and Linda really bring it home!",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
159,angel_nikk2003,An amazing performance,10,2 December 2004,"This movie was a funny look back at all the episodes of Scooby-Doo. I thought that putting all the evil characters from their other mysteries was brilliant. In this movie Daphne is much smarter. Sure she has a few stupid moments, but overall she has intelligence and wit. Sarah Michelle Gellar did a wonderful performance as this character. Shaggy and Scooby were of course you're regular brainless heroes who somehow end up saving the day. Mathew Lillard was exceptionally well in playing his role, and didn't overact. Velma,(Linda Cardellini) was still the same old Velma. Linda Cardellini fit the role expected of her and made the movie well rounded. Freddie Prinze Jr.(Fred) made his character less Narcesistic as he was before. Fred is still the committed leader who loves his admirers and especially Daphne.My rating on this movie is a 10 because it was like watching a cartoon episode of Scooby-doo, only being a motion picture. The characters were funny, and the actors did an amazing job as portraying them.",Scooby-Doo 2 - Monsters Unleashed
