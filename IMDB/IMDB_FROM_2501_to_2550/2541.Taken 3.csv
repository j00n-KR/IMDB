0,TheLittleSongbird,Good thing the series ended here,2,30 January 2018,"Moderately enjoyed the first 'Taken', while finding a fair share of faults, finding it overall an above average film that could have done more with promising potential. Was underwhelmed by 'Taken 2', which had good things but was essentially a very tired and even more ridiculous rehash with lazy stereotypes and a lack of suspense.Was worried that 'Taken 3' would be a sequel too far and that it wasn't needed, even if it still had enough to make it semi-watchable. Seeing it, 'Taken 3' not only was not necessary, even if not quite among the worst sequels ever (definitely to me one of the most pointless), and indicative of that it was a good thing it was the last 'Taken' film (from my underwhelming) but it also has very little to recommend it. It makes all the mistakes pretty much of 'Taken 2' and amplifies them and makes more on the way. The only halfway decent thing about 'Taken 3' is Liam Neeson, who at least tries and is charismatic and brooding enough. Even though one can tell still that even he knew that the film was not good and shouldn't have been made. The rest of the cast are all indifferent and are not engaging at all. They are saddled with characters that don't even have enough to them to be half-formed and are again lazy stereotypes. Direction is complete and utter chaos, and one misses the rawness and slickness of the previous two films visually. 'Taken 3' looks as though it was made on the cheap, especially with some of the worst editing seen in recent memory, editing that gave me a headache which is not good for my epilepsy. The script is filled to the brim with cheese, ham and confusion.Even the action is a failure, it is chaotically edited and photographed, gratuitously violent, unexciting and go well overboard on the ridiculousness. The pace is generally far too rushed, especially in the latter stages which affects the coherence of the story. Speaking of the story, that was one of the film's biggest issues, it may not be as much of a rehash but it is still even more fatigued than 'Taken 2' (which was as tired as it comes), even more far-fetched, even less suspenseful and thrilling and makes the further mistake of being incoherent.On the whole, very poor and that it was the last of the series was something of a relief. 2/10 Bethany Cox",Taken 3
1,Leofwine_draca,It should be great...,5,6 October 2015,"TAKEN 3 has all the potential to be a great action thriller. After all, the first TAKEN was a mini classic, a timeless movie with plenty of crowd-pleasing action and superb choreography to recommend it. TAKEN 2 was a step down but still okay, and TAKEN 3 is exactly that: okay, but middling when it should really be great.The problem with these last two films lies in director Olivier Megaton. This is the guy who also mishandled TRANSPORTER 3 and COLOMBIANA. Megaton's problem is that he has no idea how to shoot proper action sequences, so instead he goes for random split-second editing in which we get about three different camera angles every second. The result is an incoherent mess in which the viewer has zero idea of what's going on or to whom. The various fight scenes and car chases in this film are rendered incomprehensible as a result.It's a pity, because TAKEN 3 has a perfectly serviceable plot similar to classic South Korean thrillers like THE SUSPECT: Liam Neeson is wrongly accused of his wife's murder and goes on the run, searching for the real culprit while pursued by just about everybody. Neeson is pretty bored (and boring) by now but the presence of assured actors like Forest Whitaker and Dougray Scott keep things interesting, and it's great to see DIE HARD 2 thug Don Harvey back on the big screen. Let's face it, though: without Megaton, TAKEN 3 could have been rated a seven or eight; with him, it's a disappointment.",Taken 3
2,SnoopyStyle,Fugitive plus Terminator,5,29 October 2015,"Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is reconnecting with his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen). Her now-husband Stuart St. John (Dougray Scott) is not happy with them getting closer. Bryan's daughter Kim Mills (Maggie Grace) is hesitant to tell him that she's possibly pregnant. Bryan finds Lenore dead in his bed and the police arrives to arrest him. He makes a run for it and police detective Franck Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) investigates.The plot is basically The Fugitive with Bryan as The Terminator. It's a bit of a miss. The silly question of the franchise is who gets taken next. I would have given them a dog and have it taken. In this movie, Lenore's taking is not played up. That's the first problem. The franchise is called Taken after all. That would have raised the tension and the dark grittiness right from the start.I don't completely buy Bryan running away from the cops right from the start. I also don't buy Stuart's plan. The insurance company would hold off paying until the case is solved to their satisfaction. No insurance company is that eager to pay $12 million so quickly. The whole thing is on the edge of logic and believability. At least, the franchise has a ready-to-be-taken character in the next movie. Here comes Taken 4.",Taken 3
3,Prismark10,Lacking a special set of skills,1,29 November 2015,"Taken was a surprise hit which gave Liam Neeson a new lease of life as an action star. The sequel was a disappointment and this third instalment is no better and I think it is even worse.Taken 3 is set entirely in Los Angeles, Lenore (Famke Janssen) is murdered at her ex-husband Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) apartment and he is pursued for her murder.Detective Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) doggedly pursues Bryan who is out to clear his name and make sure his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is safe.Bryan finds out that some Russian gangsters were involved in her death and Lenore's husband Stuart (Dougray Scott replacing Xander Berkeley) might also be implicated as he owed the gangsters money.Scott's recasting automatically makes you suspicious of him. The plot is The Fugitive recycled with Dotzler being the only astute and sharp detective on the LAPD payroll.Director Olivier Megaton uses Bourne type of hyper-fast edits for the action scenes but they actually look rather cheaply staged. The film lacks the kinetic energy and kick ass action of the first film. Too often the film halts for emotional scenes or plot exposition.Taken 3 looks like that cynical cash in to complete the trilogy with a quickly knocked off and poor script.",Taken 3
4,claudio_carvalho,"Awful Camera, Edition and Direction and Senseless Plot",4,25 April 2015,"In Los Angeles, Lenore St. John (Famke Janssen) is murdered with sliced throat in the apartment of her ex-husband Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) and he is accused by the police of murdering her. Detective Franck Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) pursues Bryan while he investigate who might be the killer and protects his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Bryan discovers that the Russian gangster Oleg Malankov (Sam Spruell) is the responsible of Lenore's death and together with his team of friends and Lenore's husband Stuart St. John (Dougray Scott), he hunts him down. But why Lenore was killed?""Taken 3"" is a movie with awful camera, edition and direction and senseless plot. The edition is annoying with several cuts, but the plot is ridiculous. When Bryan is arrested at the gas station, no police officer is interested to see the surveillance camera footage. Why should he drug his daughter instead of putting a note in the yogurt scheduling a meeting with her in the toilet? How did he escape from the explosion in the elevator? Oleg's building is surrounded by security system, but a van parks in the parking area and no guard comes to check. Stuart spends lots of time in the van and it is not strange for the security guards. Why Stuart need to flee abducting Kim? Did Bryan's friend die in the van? Bryan causes several accidents on the highway certainly with injured people; destroys a parking building and cars; destroys an airplane; but in the end everything is OK. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Perseguição Implacável 3"" (""Implacable Search 3"")",Taken 3
5,nogodnomasters,I'M GOING OFF THE GRID,6,26 November 2018,"They didn't remake the same film again, but used the same characters. I am not sure who was ""taken"" in this one. Now after the second film, I thought Bryan (Liam Neeson) and Lenore (Famke Janssen) were a sure thing to get back together, but apparently he didn't get so much as ""thank you"" nookie from it. What does a guy got to do? She is still with the guy we hate (Dougray Scott).In this film Bryan is accused of murder and must go after the real killers while the LAPD led by Forest Whitaker are hot on his tail. Oh yea, the Russians are involved too, which are more formidable than Albanians in LA. I wasn't sure why Kim (Maggie Grace) would say ""Dad is predictable,"" apparently she was in a coma for the first two features. Unfortunately the film is like a combination of Colombo and Scooby-Doo. There are not enough suspects developed to make it overly interesting, and the entertainment is watching all the collateral damage caused by Liam only to be later ignored by the LAPD. We have digressed to car chase scenes and car crashes for excitement.This was not a great script. I think most fans of the series could have come up with something better. Admittedly I was bit disappointed, yet still entertained. It was like kissing your sister.Guide: 1 f-bomb with Russian accent. No sex or nudity.",Taken 3
6,kosmasp,The Fugitive Mills,6,14 June 2015,"Not sure if this actually marks the end of the Taken franchise. I do know that after the slack of part 2 this picks up the pace a bit again. And what better way to do that, than to copy (almost entirely!) a great 90s thriller!? No better way. But if they continue to make those, please do not put Neeson into a chase on foot again. Unless Steven Seagal is chasing him, it will look ridiculous (actually Seagal ""running"" after him will also be ridiculous, but probably a bit funnier than watching the slow Neeson be faster than someone actually running).Apart from that little ""hick-up"" (let's call it that), there is much to enjoy in this movie. If you've seen a few thrillers you know where this is going, even without knowing the movie this is copying (and even though I hinted at which movie it is - strongly). It doesn't quite reach the height of the original, but it is a nice/decent thriller",Taken 3
7,jboothmillard,Taken 3,4,18 January 2015,"The first film is always going to be the best one, the second film was almost a rehash of the previous, but I was definitely going to see a third film, even if the format had changed, directed by Olivier Megaton (Transporter 3, Colombiana, Taken 2). Basically ex-government operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has returned to a seemingly peaceful life, he briefly visits his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), but his ex-wife Lenore St. John (Famke Janssen) tells that she and husband Stuart (Dougray Scott) are having marital problems, she has rekindled feelings for Bryan, but he refuses to become involved while she is married, and later Stuart warns him to stay away from her. The next day Lenore texts Bryan to meet her, he agrees, but upon returning to his apartment he discovers Lenore's body, and almost immediately the Los Angeles Police Department arrive to arrest him on suspicion of her murder, but Bryan manages to escape and goes on the run, while also investigating the homicide, and who has set him up for murder. LAPD Inspector Franck Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) is heading the manhunt for Bryan, he meanwhile goes to a secure location recovers weapons and electronics, then retraces Lenore's steps prior to her murder, and at a convenience store he watches surveillance footage showing Lenore abducted by unidentified men, LAPD detectives then arrive, and he allows them to arrest him, only to commandeer the police car and access the LAPD's vehicle laptop computer system to analyse information. Having previously spoken to Kim on the phone, telling her first that her mother's death and that he did not kill her, Bryan meets Kim on her college campus, removing an LAPD surveillance bug she was unaware of, she tells him of Stuart having bodyguards, and after getting out he abducts and interrogates Stuart, he reveals being in debt to ex-KGB Spetsnaz and Afghan War veteran operative Oleg Malankov (Sam Spruell), this is the probable motive for Lenore's murder. With the help of his former CIA colleagues, including Sam (Leland Orser) and (Mark) Casey (Jonathan 'Jon' Gries), and a reluctant Stuart, Bryan gains entry into Malankov's heavily-guarded suite, after eliminating the guards he mortally wounds Malankov, but he says Stuart has played both men against each other, Stuart meanwhile shoots Sam and abducts Kim, intending to escape with the 12 million dollars from Lenore's life insurance policy. Bryan chases Stuart to the airport, he disables the plane as it is about to takeoff, Bryan overpowers Stuart and tells him he will spend time in prison for his involvement in Lenore's murder, and he says when he gets out he will come looking for him, in the end Stuart is arrested, Dotzler clears Bryan, and Kim reveals she is pregnant, and will call the baby Lenore after her mother. Also starring Jonny Weston as Jimmy and Dylan Bruno as Smith. Neeson still packs a punch playing the man with a ""particular set of skills"", and Whitaker does alright as the leading detective trying to catch up with him, the twist in the story here is that no-one is ""taken"", I suppose it is more the concept of life is taken and the filmmakers didn't want to be repetitive, the problem is the change in concept doesn't completely work, there are just enough over the top crashing and fight sequences to savour, and the chases keep it going, but I agree with critics it is a little bland, a little ""seen it before"", but for fans of the series it's not the most terrible thriller, not a bad action drama. Okay!",Taken 3
8,Tweekums,Action packed but rather messy part three,6,7 December 2017,"After all the excitement of the first two films one might think the Bryon Mills and those close to him deserved a break but inevitably they are caught up in further mayhem. Bryon's ex-wife is murdered in his apartment and moments after he finds her the police arrive and assume he is the killer. Bryon manages to escape from their custody and sets about finding the real killers. The police are one step behind him and as he closes in on the killers he finds himself targeted by them too if that wasn't enough he is concerned that they may also target his daughter.If you just want lots of mindless action then you could do a lot worse than this; there are numerous fight scenes, shootouts, car chases and explosions. Despite that there isn't the sense of threat that one might expect Bryon gets out of apparently unsurvivable incidents more than once; at one point he crashes his car down an elevator shaft and somehow survives. There are some twists which aren't bad. The ending is a little cliché Mills may have proved his innocence in the murder of his wife but would he really be allowed to walk free after kidnapping police officers and causing serious, possibly fatal, mayhem on the freeway?! The silliness is somewhat salvaged by Liam Neeson's fine performance as Mills. The rest of the cast is solid enough. Overall this isn't a must see but if you want some brain in neutral action you could do worse.",Taken 3
9,ma-cortes,Very thrilling and violent picture with a sensational Liam Neeson as relentless avenger father,6,17 January 2019,"Spectacular and moving following starred by the retired CIA operative Mills (Liam Neeson) with plenty of action-packed , thrills , suspense , violence and high body-count .

Consumed with rage, and framed for the crime, he goes on the run to evade the relentless pursuit of the CIA, FBI and the police (law enforcement : Forest Whitaker , Don Harvey , Dylan Bruno) . For one last time, Mills must use his ""particular set of skills,"" to track down the real killers, exact his unique brand of justice, and protect the only thing that matters to him now - his daughter. Meanwhile , his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is pregnant and really affected for the killing . Shortly after , Mills is rescuing his daughter from the vicious killers . Then , Bryan enlists his daughter to help him and attempts to clear his name and he swears revenge and retaliation against the murdererers .

As he faces off a feared villian called Oleg Malinkov (Sam Spruell) , an ex-soldier who was in the Russian army when they invaded Afghanistan . First, they took his daughter. Now, they're coming for him. It Ends Here. They want revenge, They chose the wrong guy. This time, they come for him.
Nail-biting and extremely violent film with a phenomenal Liam Neeson as an implacable avenger daddy .This stirring film contains intrigue , thrills, chills, frenetic action, shootouts , long run time car pursuits , car crashes , and violent fights . From start to finish the noisy action and fast movement are unstopped . Liam Neeson acting as hard-rock , two-fisted retired agent is top-notch , doing all his own fight sequences for the movie , he is the wronged father who must lay his life on the line to protect his intimate family against time and an army of ominous Russian mobsters . Being well accompanied by Maggie Grace as daughter and Famke Janssen in a brief acting as his ex-wife , repeating efficiently their previous roles . Secondary cast is frankly good, such as : Forest Whitaker , Dougray Scott , Sam Spruell , Don Harvey ,David Warshofsky , Jon Gries , and Leland Orser , among others . Nice cinematography by cameraman Eric Kress , using Steadicam and zooms with numerous locations from Los Angeles . The musician Nathaniel Mechaly creates a thrilling , moving soundtrack fitting to frantic action . Lavishly produced by the successful French producer and director Luc Besson from his production company Eurocorps . The trilogy is formed by ¨Taken 1¨ (2008) by Pierre Morel with Maggie Grace , Xander Berkeley , Holy Valance , Katie Cassidy ; in which a gang of human traffickers abduct Kim who barely has time to call her dad and give him information about an Albanese kidnapper and then Bryan seeks vendetta . ¨Taken 2¨ (2012) by Oliver Megathon with D.B. Sweeney ,Luke Grimes , Jon Gries , Rade Serbedzija , set in Istanbul in which Bryan and Lenore are abducted by the Albanian father of a kidnapper Mills killed while rescuing his daughter. And this final ""Taken 3"" movie in the trilogy, at least this is what is expected at the time of production and release . This trilogy was shot as an R-rated film, but edited down to a PG-13 for its theatrical reléase .The flick was compellingly directed by Oliver Meghaton who had previously directed other nice action films, such as ¨Taken 2¨, ¨Transporter 3¨ with Jason Statham , ¨The red siren¨ with Asia Argento and ¨Colombiana¨ with Zoe Saldana , also produced by Luc Besson . Megaton was formerly a graffiti artist and took his name from his birthday : the 6th of August 1965 is the 20th anniversary of the dropping of the Hiroshima A-bomb . Rating : 6.5/10 . Better than average sequel , well worth seeing . The picture will appeal to explosive action fans and Liam Neeson fans .",Taken 3
10,blanche-2,you know after Taken 2 we were in trouble,6,23 November 2015,"I didn't see this movie in the theater, I saw it on Netflix. So that is why I am perhaps a little more forgiving than most of the other reviewers.In Taken 3, Bryan Mills, an ex-government operative, is the prime suspect in the murder of his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) after receiving a text from her asking to meet. As he's trying to revive her, the police enter.The rest of the film is occupied with car chases, explosions, and fights. It moves quickly, and all has to do with a Russian bad man attempting to recover some money. That's a real Macguffin, because it really just had to do with watching Mills escape Forest Whittaker, the cop after him, and others. Its purpose is also to bring this series of films to a merciful end.When I watch an action movie I suspend all sense of reality and just go with it, otherwise, like others here, I would drive myself nuts. I couldn't believe some of the things Liam Neeson survived. He was Superman, Aquaman, and some other man all at once. Huge explosions, buildings blown up, cars on fire, and out he walks. A miracle.I just read ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is being done again. This film is a good example as to why. No one, it seems, can come up with a decent idea.",Taken 3

We only see what he is really like at the film's climax.There are the usual chase scenes, and gun play galore. We have the daughter, caught in the middle here.Not only is the above the obvious we've seen so many times in film, we see the usual collecting the insurance on the deceased as the major motive for her demise.",Taken 3

13,sunwarrior13,It Ends Here.........Finally!!!!!,7,22 June 2015,"Taken 3 is third film of the Taken franchise that stars Liam Neeson as the former CIA operative Bryan Mills together with Forest Whitaker, Maggie Grace, and Famke Janssen.It has a film slogan ""It Ends Here"" which is sort of interesting as it is definitely something to describe how this third Taken film,written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen and directed by Olivier Megaton,appealed to me as a viewer.The film starts when Bryan's daughter Kim discovers that she is accidentally pregnant.Then,her father visits her three days before her birthday.Later,we get to see his ex-wife Lenore and Bryan talking to each other with the former asking for a reconciliation.Too bad it was cut short after Bryan discovered that she was murdered with him being set up.This prompts him to seek those who are responsible for the crime while he evades the relentless pursuit of the police,led by LAPD Inspector Frank Dotzler, as he is the primary suspect for Lenore's death.He uses the operative skills to solve the mystery,pursue the killers and protect his daughter Kim from them.Going back to the first paragraph,the movie's slogan tells the viewers that this will become the last sequel of the franchise.With that in mind,the film writers and producers decided to just come up with a story similar to the first two films.Only this time,one of Bryan's family isn't kidnapped - his daughter in Taken 1 and his ex- wife in Taken 2 - but rather his family member - ex-wife - is killed by the people he is trying to pursue.Although people who view this film aren't really concerned about the plot,too bad that those who love action films would yawn to many of the action scenes in it as they are barely acceptable and provides very little thrills and excitement.Of course,predictability also becomes a factor as we get to witness villains who looked not guilty at the first half of the film but have already provided the viewer of unclear motives and intentions like Lenore's present husband,Stuart St. John.In summary,it provides nothing new after the viewers have been accustomed with the first two Taken films.The film tells its viewers ""It Ends Here"" to its viewers.I guess that their probable response is ""Finally!!!!!"".",Taken 3
14,Scarecrow-88,Taken 3,5,17 January 2015,"Liam Neeson returns once again to the role of Bryan Mills, this time dealing with what he believes to be a Russian ex-military superkiller, expecting a specific payday from a certain key figure who owes him money (there's an obvious reason why Ben's ex-wife (Famke Janssen, in a basic cameo appearance) is targeted as a mark for death). Mills is visited by ex-wife, Lenore, speaking exhaustively about her dissipating marriage to businessman, Stuart (Dougray Scott; he has one of those faces that seems innocent enough but carries a level of distrust that paints him as a character to be viewed with suspicion), and Kim (Maggie Smith) realizes she's pregnant with boyfriend's child. Well, right out of the advertisements for Taken 3, it is established that Janssen perishes so the plot itself places Bryan on the lam from the Los Angeles police who suspect him of her murder since her dead body was found in the bed of his home. And as is the case yet again, Bryan must continue to protect Kim, bound to find herself in peril. Forest Whitaker is the detective out to catch Lenore's killer and bring Bryan in to ""let the law decide"". This movie has some nice footrace and highway chase scenes where Bryan must evade the city police, but the hand-to-hand fights are a disappointment as is the gunplaythe PG-13 rating handcuffs the filmmakers. We have to tolerate seeing nothing much as the editing purposely avoids bloodshed and broken bones on screen. Neeson's effortless charisma is expected and accounted for and when the fights take place the editing is convincing enough to fool us into believing he was right in the middle of martial arts battles with foes. His disabling the police in quick succession is edited haphazardly, and this was rather frustrating to me as a viewer who wants to actually see the action instead of rapid-edit chaos. All of this follows the same pattern as the previous films, but for some reason this third film's fight editing bugged me a bit more. Truth is the film needed to be marketed to a wider audience and seeing bodies decimated as structures are by machine and shot guns won't cut it with the ratings board. To tell the truth, there's a water torture scene where Bryan is trying to pry away information from Stuart, and it is as unnerving as the use of fists to get the goods concealed. The plotting is implausible and eye-rolling, but it allows Bryan to outsmart, outwit, and outfight those that try to either catch him or do him wrong. That Bryan can possibly walk away without even a ticket for all the damage caused by his pursuit of those responsible for Lenore's death as Whitaker's cop just offers a handshake and amuses at all that took place and was solved is hard to swallow. This is probably the worst of the series but has its moments. It was nice to see Leland Orser, Jon Gries, and David Warshofsky (typically known for playing villains and criminals) showing up as allies to Neeson, well appreciated for their skills in their art of making the lives of the cops miserable when they need to learn of Bryan's methods and whereabouts. I think it is safe to say that this should be the end of the series, but if it charts down the path of the first two films, there will be a fourth film in the works eventually. The battle between Neeson and the Russian criminal stereotype with tattoos in his underwear and robe is rather embarrassing.",Taken 3

16,zardoz-13,The Third Time Is The Charm!!!,10,11 January 2015,"A good action thriller rarely gives its hero a chance to catch his breath. The bottom seems to fall out from under Liam Neeson in the second ""Taken"" sequel with twists, thrills, and surprises galore. In ""Taken 3,"" the 62-year old Irish thespian makes monkeys out of some rather nasty apes. This improbable but exciting, PG-13-rated, crime thriller differs from its predecessors. Not only does it take place in Los Angeles rather than Europe, but also nobody abducts anybody. Instead, ""Taken 3"" is a wrongly-accused, innocent man, murder mystery about husband accused of carving up his former wife. The first sign an action franchise is on the ropes is when the producers either start pulling the plug on primary characters or replacing actors. The Famke Janssen character Lenore St. John exits the action early on in this fleet-footed installment, and she ends up in the morgue with a slashed throat. Lenore won't make an encore unless ""Transporter"" writer & producer Luc Besson pulls a ""Dallas"" and resurrects this dame. Similarly, ""Mission Impossible 2"" actor Dougray Scott takes over the role that actor Xander Berkeley originated as Lenora's second husband, Stuart St. John, who appeared briefly in ""Taken."" Nevertheless, despite these changes and the ill things they usually bode for a Hollywood franchise, ""Taken 3"" surpasses the first two epics. ""Taken 2"" director Olivier Megaton and ""Taken"" scenarists Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen never let the pace slacken once they've established the premise and everything goes to Hell in a bucket. Neeson has to elude cops on foot, survive cars plunging respectively down elevators as well as hillsides with explosive results, swerve around cars and gigantic cargo container boxes careening down a freeway, and dodge a hailstorm of blazing lead. If you enjoyed the first two ""Taken"" movies, you shouldn't be disappointed with the third one. Personally, I liked it enough to watch it twice. Things get off to a lightweight start with former CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson of ""Nonstop"") buying his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace of ""Lockout"") a huge, stuffed Panda bear for her birthday. While Bryan is planning to surprise Kim, Kim is staring incredulously at a pregnancy test and pondering her collegiate future. Bryan shows up with the Panda and a bottle of champagne. Kim doesn't know what to say except he is three days early. Our hero explains that he is struggling with the problem of not being predictable. Later, Bryan's former wife Lenora visits him at his apartment and complains that her husband Stuart and she are experiencing marital woes. She kisses Bryan in a moment of intimacy, but he breaks off the lip-lock. Eventually, a jealous Stuart asks Bryan to stop seeing his wife. Stuart tells Bryan he plans to go to Las Vegas the next day. Meantime, Bryan spends part of that day out golfing with some buddies. When he arrives home, Bryan discovers a knife on the floor of his apartment. Ignorantly, he picks up the knife, enters his bedroom, and finds Lenora sprawled in his bed with her throat cut. Before he realizes what has happened, two uniformed Los Angeles Police Department cops storm in with their pistols drawn. When they try to handcuff him, Bryan disarms them and flees. A furious foot chase ensues with Bryan charging down back streets, vaulting high fences, and scrambling through homes with the fuzz at his heels. Miraculously, relying on his ingenuity, Bryan manages to elude them. LAPD Inspector Franck Dotzler (Oscar-winner Forest Whitaker of ""The Last King of Scotland"") takes charge of the investigation. Appropriately enough, Dotzler is baffled when he examines Bryan's records and finds staggering information gaps. ""The man is a ghost,"" he proclaims in frustration to his colleagues, and so he orders them to keep tabs on Bryan's twentysomething daughter Kim. No sooner has he eluded the long arm of the law than he informs Kim that he had nothing to do with his ex-wife's demise. Afterwards, Bryan takes refuge at a hideout and assembles the only four men that he can trust who worked with him in the CIA. Director Olivier Megaton relies on multiple cameras to capture the no-holds-barred action throughout its nimble 109 minutes. Good action thrillers not only keep the hero leaping through fiery hoops, but they also keep the audience guessing. At least two major surprises take place during ""Taken 3,"" and the villains qualify as homicidal hellions. During one kinetic liquor store shoot-out, Bryan eliminates four trigger-happy henchmen in a hail of gunfire. At one point, he has the fourth dastard on his knees with a pistol in his face. Bryan threatens to shoot the thug if he doesn't reveal the identity of his villainous boss. Rather than come clean, the thug snarls that he would rather die than squeal, tears the gun from Bryan's fingers, and shoots himself in the face. One of the biggest scenes involves our hero infiltrating the lair of a murderous Russian mobster in downtown L.A. who has several heavily armed goons guarding his premises along with a sophisticated surveillance security system. Naturally, Bryan has few problems circumventing the elaborate security system, but the Russian springs a few surprises on him when they tangle. Predictably, the police remain two jumps behind our hero, but they never let up on the pressure that they exert on both Bryan and Kim during their investigation. Forest Whitaker doesn't have much of a role to work with, but he is a live-wire every moment he appears on camera, and he gets some wonderful mileage out of twisting a rubber band around his hand. Dougray Scott is exceptional as Lenora's complicated husband who is up to his ears in trouble with Sam Spruell's vicious, heavily tattooed Russian gunsel Oleg Malankov. Watching ""Taken 3"" is like watching the riveting Keanu Reeves' thriller ""John Wick."" These two movies amount to guilty pleasures with the accent on outlandish action sequences where the hero is not only outnumbered but also outgunned.",Taken 3

At least this one isn't misogynistic), solving the case in this ""procedural that doesn't live up to an episode of a TV show of that genre"". Not delivering on a good third of what the trailer promises, this never comes close to the level of one of the recent movies with the same core plot – Sin City, Shooter, The Bourne Supremacy – there's little reason to watch this at all, let alone in the theater.With too many characters, you'd expect at least some of them to be interesting or memorable. There's only one example of such, and he's hardly in it. We've got slightly dopey cop buddies, the other retired spies are given more to do in what feels like fanfic, Stuart is back and, like perfect, bland boyfriend Jamie(who isn't purely milk toast here), immensely obviously recast, and not even to any effect. At no point does this really involve us. The concept leads to a minimal amount of the fast-paced neck-breaking, shooting and tracking-down-of-family-member-in-peril that we expect from this series, instead giving us set-pieces that don't belong in it, especially having a lot of extended chasing with no payoff.There's a little strong language, mild violence(reduced to PG-13 to a laughable degree I'm still not sure whether or not this one guy died, and if so, of what) and implied sexuality in this. I recommend this to only those addicted to Liam in this type of flick. 5/10",Taken 3

While Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen reteam with a more tight and streamlined screenplay than the last chapter of the successful high octane franchise - as well as its director Olivier Megaton keeping things lively - it is still predictable as to who the perpetuator is even before he makes his appearance.

With the CIA and FBI on his trail, Bryan realises that it's only a matter of time before his enemies get to his daughter Kim. Determined to keep her alive, his only hope for saving her is to clear his name before he is captured. But Bryan does possess his trademark, and catchphrase, ""particular set of skills"" to stay one step ahead of the men who want his family dead, but proving that he's innocent of murder and seeing that the real killers face justice might be the last thing he ever does, because Neeson has said for a second time he wouldn't do another sequel....Remember when he said that just after Taken 2 was released? Something along the lines of 'who are they going to take, my cat?'. Well just like he was retiring from acting after The Haunting, Neeson has gone back on his word and gave us another cash cow.And that's all what this film is. And insufferable cash cow, yet again watered down within an inch of its inane life, so lots of money will line Besson's pocket.If he were still making movies like 'Nikita', 'Leon', or even 'The Fifth Element', these films wouldn't even exist, and if they did, they would have a lot more about them.Just like the second one, whenever there is a fight, hardly any contact is made, and in some parts it's so poorly edited, you could almost swear that Mills is dancing rather than fighting. And mentioning swearing, there are a few times when characters are mouthing curse words, and something else is said, just like TV used to do back in the eighties.Car chases feature wrecked cars on freeways with no passengers, Mills survives stupendously inescapable situations, and Forest Whitaker spends the movie playing with an elastic band (obviously he has problems which will probably be addressed in the Blu Ray release) and doing that talk.........he does................with a pause.............in-between words.............when he plays someone in authority.Neeson action resurgence is looking a bit old hat now, but this won't hurt his career much, he's pretty much as Travolta was back in the mid-Nineties. Remember when Phenomenon and Michael were huge hits? Seen them in the past ten years? Thought not.It's not as bad as the second movie, but then being stung by a Bee on the hand, isn't as bad as being stung by a Bee on the face.It's another worthless dud from Besson, who has absolutely no respect for his audience, them this pile of proverbial.Taken 4, or, T4ken, will be released in about two and a half years I'm guessing, I'm just hoping Besson gets all his producing, writing, and funding privileges 'Taken' away from him.",Taken 3

Killing of Lenore just means there is less hope of a happy ending and less tension because of that.4. no exotic location is half the fun gone.5. as for exotic villain, the very un-Russian Sam Spruell is completely wrong as a Russian killer. No way in the league of Marco and father.6. not enough humor link up with the previous movies except for 'Good luck' and a phone call to Kim.7. Liam's fighting scenes seems abruptly edited with short little punches and obvious photographic tricks to make it seem like it is real action. I know he is getting on but they didn't hide it well.8. Forrest seems sleepier than usual.The shame is this could have been better written and the story could have gone in so many other directions. Story usually hasn't been the weak part of a Luc Besson movie. Maggie Grace acts well enough but she doesn't have enough on her shoulders like in Taken 2. Seemed like a step backwards.

23,Wuchakk,"Pales by comparison to the first film, plus a huge plot hole",5,11 January 2015,"""Taken 3"" (2014) follows the previous from from 2008 and 2012. This time Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is falsely accused of murder and becomes a fugitive where he simultaneously eludes the police, headed by Franck Dotzler (Forest Whitaker), and goes after the bad dudes. Meanwhile Mills stays in covert contact with his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). Famke Janssen has a small role as Mills' ex-wife and Don Harvey a bigger role as her husband.The highlights of this series are the righteous, kick-axx protagonist played by Liam, his loving relationship with his precious daughter and the intense action. Everything magically clicked in the first film and it broke the threshold of greatness as a serious action/thriller with James Bond trimmings. The sequels are more of the same, but mediocre by comparison.One thing that takes down my rating for ""Taken 3"" is the huge plot hole of Mills' attempted escape on the highway, which causes some serious wrecks – nigh pile-ups – and risks the lives of hundreds of innocents. It's hard to imagine that no one died in this sequence and, if nothing else, there were numerous serious injuries, not to mention incredible property damage. What's my problem with this? Mills is supposed to be the noble hero – the good guy – and yet he seriously risks the lives of hundreds in order to nail whoever framed him and murdered a person close to him. How is it just for numerous innocents to die or be seriously injured in order to catch the culprit(s)? How would this make up for the death of ONE person? On top of this, it wasn't even necessary for him to escape at this point since he had led the police to the video recording that proved he was innocent and would put them on the trail of the true murderer(s). So why put all these innocents in grave jeopardy? When this happened I automatically lost respect and sympathy for the protagonist and the rest of the film was pretty much an action blur, albeit somewhat compelling. Worst of all, there is no mention of the incredible damage Mills causes due to his escape on the highway and no mention of lives lost or severely injured because of his outrageous recklessness.Still, it's entertaining enough if you're a fan of the series, but you'll have to turn off your brain.The film runs 109 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area, Spain and Atlanta.GRADE: C+",Taken 3
24,gradyharp,'Why do you have to be so damn honorable?',8,4 May 2015,"Luc Besson offers is third round of the very popular Liam Neeson series TAKEN, changing the name a bit to TAK3N (a little too cutesy) but retaining the smart dialogue and non-stop action of the first two. This one is directed by Olivier Megaton who also drove TAKEN 2 into fame. For all the comparisons and whispered criticisms of this version not being up to the previous two installments, this third installment works for other reasons.Why it is so important to continuing using the Russians as bad guys becomes a bit tiresome, but here it works on a more sophisticated level. To recap, Liam Neeson returns as ex-covert operative Bryan Mills, whose long awaited reconciliation with his ex-wife (Famke Janssen, don't blink or you'll miss her) is tragically cut short when she is brutally murdered. Consumed with rage, and framed for the crime, he goes on the run to evade the relentless pursuit of the CIA, FBI and the police. For one last time, Mills must use his ""particular set of skills,"" to track down the real killers, exact his unique brand of justice, and protect the only thing that matters to him now - his daughter (Maggie Grace). The role of Lenore's husband is polished by Dougray Scott, Forest Whitaker brings an uncanny veracity to his role as a policeman, and the supporting rolls on both sides of the story are well managed by Don Harvey, Sam Spruell, Dylan Bruno, Leland Orser, David Warshofsky, Andrew Howard et al.The interaction between Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace make the somewhat disjointed plot hold together.

27,SimonJack,An easy spot of the culprit in this mindless mayhem,3,7 January 2019,"""Taken 3"" joins a long list of the modern generation of almost constant action films. These simple plot films amount to little more than 90 minutes or so of mayhem. The script is so weak that I could guess the main culprit a few minutes into this film. There is so little new in any of these modern mayhem movies. Hollywood seems to stamp them out for a segment of the public that apparently thrives on portrayals of violence and destruction.When quality actors such as Liam Neeson stoop to doing these mindless, no-talent-required types of films, it says something about the condition of Hollywood. There are so few dramas, quality mysteries, comedies and other good stories for movie making into the 21st century. And, apparently a shortage of talented writers to create quality works. One wonders if society isn't beginning to morph into some sort of zombies from watching this stuff.The only challenge one can see in these films is an apparent effort to outdo other films in the frequency, variety and volume of accidents, killings, and destruction. In this film, the CGI of the freeway collisions is so obvious that it borders on poorly made sci-fi. And the acting? What acting? The mayhem doesn't slow down enough for anyone to do any acting. What little there is of it is poor at best. That goes for Neeson and everyone. Even Forest Whitaker, who has some deliberate moments on the screen, seems wooden and canned.Why did I bother to sit through this film to the end. Well, I bought it by mistake out of a store discount bin. I thought I was buying the original ""Taken."" I had seen it in the theater when it came out in 2008. At the big discount price, I thought I'd watch it again. This second sequel is so poor that I don't think I'll bother to watch ""Taken 2."" This series seems to be going the way of the vast majority of movies that have sequels made. The first sequel - second edition, is much less of a film than the original. After that, further sequels drop fast in quality and audience favor.I would note that the PG-13 rating for films like this speaks a lot about the changing mindset of society.

I mean, somebody takes Neeson's family and he runs off and saves everybody. It is all in the journey, right? No. In this film his family is not really taken, nobody is. Instead, it is basically the plot of The Fugitive, but much less imaginative. At every step the police is portrayed as incompetent, put there just to show comparatively how awesome Liam is. To put Whitaker in the role of the police detective which is always one step behind, even when he knows that Neeson's character is innocent, was a waste of time. The role of the daughter is completely mismanaged as well, as are the roles of his friends.Bottom line: it takes a lot of talent to screw up an action flick, almost as much as with a porn film, but by God Olivier Megaton manages to do just that. I rated the film just below average just because Liam Neeson is, in fact, awesome. Other than that, it is a waste of time to watch it.",Taken 3

Then decided to figure out what direction to go with it all. After making a simple outline of the whole plot, which is basically a rehash of other action movies. With the hero being on the run from the feds and all that. So the first ""Taken"" movie was this cool quasi video game esque style movie that was intriguing and entertaining from beginning to end. With lots of other action movies taking a similar route with it's formula. But this not only lack the dark, gritty and enticing elements of the first one but it's also the most ridiculous and far-fetched movie in this franchise so far. While the first ""Taken"" movie action set pieces with the gun wielding action and chase sequences was thrilling and cool. It's just lame, overdone and boring to watch. Yeah, Liam Neeson was a badass in the first movie, but now he is superman. This is one of those movies where the protagonist is on the run or trying to get away from the feds and this smart cop is on his tail. Except it has been done in a much clever and entertaining manner. Seriously some parts of this movie was just laughable. Despite my gripe with this third installment, at least it wasn't as bad as the second one. It isn't a super awful action movie, but it's still a waste unless you really want to see how this franchise would end.

It was directed by Olivier Megaton (who also directed 'TAKEN 2') and of course stars Liam Neeson, reprising his role as Bryan Mills for the third time. Mills this time is on the run from the police, for the suspected murder of his ex-wife. Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen also reprise their roles, from the first two films, and Forest Whitaker and Dougray Scott join the cast, this time around. I don't think the movie is as horrible as the majority of critics have made it out to be (it's currently 11% positive on Rotten Tomatoes, with a 3.4 average rating!) but it is the weakest film of the series.Retired CIA agent Bryan Mills (Neeson) is once again trying to bond with his daughter, Kim (Grace). He still can't seem to get used to the fact that she's a grown woman now, so grown up that she's now pregnant with a child of her own; which Bryan doesn't know about. He buys her a big stuffed bear, as a present, and after that doesn't go so well he meets up with his ex-wife, Lenore (Janssen). Lenore tells him her current marriage, to Stuart St. John (Scott), isn't going so well and she still has romantic feelings for him. After Bryan is paid a visit by Stuart, and is threatened by him, he finds Lenore dead in his apartment. At the same time, the LAPD is breaking down his door and Bryan decides to flee the scene of the crime. He spends the rest of the movie on the run, trying to find his wife's killer. Whitaker plays the LAPD inspector desperately trying to bring him in.I liked the first 'TAKEN' quite a bit but I found the second film to be less impressive (I gave the first movie a 4 star rating, out of 5, and the second one 3.5 stars). Listening to the critics, I went into this installment expecting to see a 2 or 2.5 star movie; so I was happy it was better than what I expected. The action scenes, in this one, are still good but they do feel like they were severely edited for TV (I guess the filmmakers plan on releasing an R-rated Blu-ray cut, like they did the second film though). It's a pretty silly action flick, but so were the first two films, and fans will still get what they came for; Liam Neeson kicking a lot of ass.

Wow. If anyone thought that movie was bad, just watch the third chapter I initially was hoping would be the Last Crusade of the series. False. And I actually like Taken 2 the second time a whole lot more than the first viewing.This absolutely atrocious sequel that has nothing to do with the series, let alone anything to do with ""TAKING,"" is basically a sometimes action script that was altered to piggyback on the successful series. Yes. Just like Troll 2 and just about as bad.After an incredibly stale opening that, again, feels nothing like a ""Taken"" movie, it continues with basically, the same dumb opening of Alien 3. What follows is an amazingly predictable movie where a wrongfully accused 62-year-old actor acts like someone as athletic as someone a third of his age and can escape explosions as easily as Batman dodging a nuclear explosion in under 5 seconds. It's no wonder Liam Neeson starred in The A-Team movie – he never has a scratch on him after unbelievably surviving multiple car wrecks that would easily kill 999 out of 1,000 people.What this movie should've done was to fire Liam, hire Jason Statham, rename this as Transporter 4 and acknowledge the silliness like that series did. The decision is clear: Watch 2008's Taken and repeatedly. No need to see #2 or #3. Dear God, please let there be no fourth Taken. I can't possibly ""take"" this anymore.* * *Final thoughts: Lesson learned – to clear your name from a crime you didn't commit, kill as many people in cold blood while leaving more than enough evidence behind – not to mention, admitting to the police that you murdered someone – and then you can live happily ever after.

It certainly has its moments, there are some stellar action sequences and some really tense scenes that make for a pleasant viewing that is certainly not boring. It is a pleasure as always to see Liam Nesson naturally slip back in to Bryan Mills' shoes, he has a very effortless screen presence. When I first saw the trailer, I was delighted to see this movie taking a different approach and doing something very unlike the last two films. However, this plot is in no way as engaging or gripping as the previous two, it was a lot more predictable and felt like any other action. While the first Taken was breaking boundaries, this movie played it safe.There is also some very cringe worthy dialogue throughout that took me out of it on a regular basis. No matter how absurd the characters situation is, everything they say in response should still feel realistic, there were far too many ""action movie lines"" that no one would ever say in real life. No one's heart seemed to be in this, and that was it's downfall. Reasonably well executed, Taken 3 falls flat in far too many other areas for me to possibly recommend it.

36,secondtake,"Purely mercenary sequel, overblown and even dull",5,19 June 2015,"Taken 3 (2014)Well, I had seen the other two ""Taken"" films, and really liked the first one, to my surprise. And the second one kept me going despite it dependence on chase and action moments and its derivative qualities. So here is the third, and the rescued daughter from the earlier movies is still around, and still peripheral (sweet and meek). But it's Liam Neeson all the way here, the strong father figure out to save his own skin.The writer here is the often talented Luc Besson, and the director is fellow French moviemaker Olivier Megaton, who also directed ""Taken 2"" and who has a name that goes well with his overkill approach. Heh. But unlike the first two movies, this one doesn't use its European roots at all, which I found part of the appeal before—seeing a French version of an action flick. In that way, the parallel to the Bourne movies (which are better in most ways) is also lost here. This is a California film and begins to resemble Hollywood in the worst predictable ways. Oh, this is well done formula stuff here, just accept that and go for the ride. Decenlty done, yes. But formula, too. I think even the movie makers admit they are trying to go for a proved, lucrative Hollywood style, with likable heroes and strong visual kinetics. Neeson, very not-French, makes an increasingly capable leading man as he ages, with some kind of gravitas to his movements. I think of him as more lumbering than his character (with body- doubles flying over fences and cars with great agility), but he represents solidity and determination beautifully. I like him, and you have to like him to watch him go through truly improbable scenes, one after another.Is this actually worth watching? A couple answers: 1) If you loved Taken 1 you might love this, but it's not a sequel, so it starts from scratch. 2) If you loved Taken 2 you'll like this, for sure. 3) If you haven't seen either of the preceding, the one to watch is the original (which has a different director). Skip this one now and skip it fast. It's not that it's horrible, except that with all this talent it's a horrible shame. And clearly money grubbing territory.",Taken 3
37,A_Different_Drummer,"""Don't Be Such A Pessimist"" (Cool Dialog)",7,23 January 2015,"Let's review.(Quoting from my IMDb reviews of the first two) Taken 1 was one of those unexpected surprises that keeps the wheels in Tinseltown turning. It turned Neeson, a very competent actor, into filmdom's oldest and newest action hero. A neat trick. It was actually a very well made product and even with all the attention, still under-rated. It was better than people thought.OK, to be clear. Neeson was not getting any younger and when offered Taken 2, he took it. Sorry for the pun. Taken 2 was not so much a film as an IQ test. If you thought it was in the same class as Taken 1, you failed the test. Sorry. The truth hurts.To atone for Taken 2, Neeson did the Tombstone flic. It was great and showed the world he was still an A-list actor. Apology accepted.Hollywood never ever leaves money on the table. Which brings us to Taken 3. Not really a Taken movie, more of what you would expect if they wanted to do a TV series on the Neeson character and they started with a long pilot.It is much better than Taken 2 but then again so is footage of your dog's birthday party.It is not bad. Depends on your expectations.High expectations, you will not be happy.Bored and want to spend time with Liam?You could do worse.",Taken 3

Bryan Mills is trying to balance his work life with raising his daughter with his ex-wife. When he comes home he finds his ex-wife dead in his bed and he is the prime suspect. Rather than being taken in by the cops he fights back and begins his mission to not only solve the mystery of his ex-wife's murder, but save his daughter from the same fate. I have said for a few years now that after the success of the first Taken, Liam Neeson seems to be doing just a different version of that movie over and over. Taken 2, Non-Stop, Walk Among The Tombstonesthese have all had the same idea. The ironic thing about this movie is that this one is a little different. It still has most of the aspects we have come to expect from a Neeson movie, but this one felt more like the Fugitive than Taken. That isn't a bad thing. All that said, I like the movies he is in, they are entertaining and fun to watch, this is no exception. Overall, nothing amazing but fun to watch and I enjoyed it well enough.

41,westsideschl,A Not Creative Big Paycheck,2,26 April 2015,"A few spoilers but how can predictable be a spoiler? Positive: Opening scenes and credits were novel and capturing (haha). Luc's only french flavor positive in this endeavor. Negatives (Oh no!) 1. Writer's block stereotype of another romantic triangle/issues as central to story's progress - do they never end? 2. The initial kicker, to turn me skeptical, was Bryan (Liam) panicking at what was an obvious, to any middle schooler, easily solvable setup. I thought he was so suppose to be Sherlock cool & intelligent? 3. Overcoming a half dozen or more cops, most with guns pointed at him. Writer's must not be paying attention to the news or even shot a gun for how quickly multiple rounds can be fired off. 4. The Luc presence is felt with all the shaky camera and weird camera angles - mostly a nauseating effect that contributes nothing. Meant to make boring repetitive action scenes seem different. 5. They still have pay phones? How trite; been done ad nauseam in the past eighty years. What happened to prepaid untraceable cell phones from multiple sleazy sources and walkups. 6. Forest as the sleuthing Sherlock sergeant: First, he's stuck in a rut with lack of character versatility, other than the same one he's shown for the past 30 some odd years. Second, he and his cops' troop showcase the stereotype of dumb/rigid/bumbling/lack of forensics' behaviors solely meant to keep the film alive for 90 min. 7. The secret hideaway, with arms' cache hidden within dirty towels, within pipes, etc. pushed credulity to it's limits - more laughable than believable. 8. How many times have we seen in movies that someone happens to have a small wire that handcuff makers are obviously too dumb to design locks to prevent that inevitable escape? Oh, of course both cops in the front seat always lose in the following tussle. 9. Luc's french connection presents itself again with the inevitable car chase scenes (with the latest film hook of wrong way driving at high speed) followed by artistically framed vehicles spinning in the air like gymnasts and then followed by the inevitable parking garage scene. 10. Guess what color and type of vehicle the bad guys are driving? Black SUVs. Then black SUV pushes poor Liam's car over a cliff; car explodes (multiple times with multiple camera angles); Liam survives (really) - haven't seen that improbable action scene before. 11. The ultimate, writer's who have no creativity skills, cliché is guess who the bad guys are? Couldn't be tattooed skinhead Russians by some remote chance? Liam takes them all out with wine bottles and head butts. Why is it always in head butts that the bad guys get knocked out and the good guy shows no effects. The forces are equal for both parties! Oh well - that's movies. 12. Liam now has a team and they magically disrupt security cameras at will and on cue. How novel! 13. More writer's mental cramps with the stereotype of Liam suppose to be in an elevator and as it slowly descends there's a group waiting at the doors with guns drawn. Oh, surprise. NO LIAM. 14. I was wondering if there would be a helicopter. 15. Liam, who as a person has great qualities, looked tired and mechanical and action scenes needed rescuing by camera angles. 16. Finally, flash cut-backs to explain the obvious to the grade schoolers watching. Sorry, that was mean. Conclusion: With not much effort a lot of people walked home with big paychecks and society continues to advance from such cultural enhancements as this film.",Taken 3
42,851222,Average action flick,6,13 April 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Taken 3"" (2014) is unnecessary part in a mediocre franchise. It has action, but it isn't really involving or there isn't really a tension in this movie, as we all know how it will eventually end up.First action scene of this movie was awful because of really bad editing. There are some many cuts that you simply won't be able to follow it - her director uses more cuts than M.Bay! Unfortunately they don't add tension aka. ""Born"" - more they just distract.Forest Whitaker steals every scene he is in, but he is not here for a lot of time. They probably tried to make some game aka. ""The Fugitive"" but the script was to week and formulaic to pull it of. Great actor finds what to do in many scenes, as for example to play with elastic band because there isn't much to do on screen. And he carries chess figure. To look more cool.

43,tabuno,An Emotive Action Thriller,8,15 January 2019,"25 January 2015. Taken 3 has some resemblance to The Bourne Supremacy (2004). What makes this movie more than the usual action thriller is the lasting emotional torment of death of a close one. The chase scenes are both action-packed and intriguing but at the same time designed to avoid the technical difficulty of realism. The other problem with this movie is its descent into the more stereotypical good and bad guy motif making the rampage much more black and white, minimizing the cerebral ethical dilemma and the fighting scenes don't quite of the crispness of earlier Taken movies. Of note, Forrest Whitaker gets a nice role with law enforcement actually presented in much more intelligent terms than usual. So for as much that typically the same, there is also the enhancements in script that makes this movie above average. This third movie of the Taken series, if not better than, is at least equal to the quality of its predecessors.",Taken 3
44,nairtejas,An Unoriginal Venture. ♦ 40%,4,24 January 2015,"They should have stopped at two. Making a third one while you're gasping for a story confirms that it's dollar bills they are behind. Taken 3 fails miserably.After killing a prime character of the series, the story takes you on a predictable cat-and-mouse chase which involves a boring Russian cartel head this time. The basic story of the fit ex-military man who has the world's worst and craziest wife and daughter is now dissolved and the whole drama crawls out of its sweet familial boundaries. With an unoriginal story, Taken 3 crosses the threshold of unbelievability over 100% which is usually at about 40% in the other Taken films.Forrest Whitaker is sleepwalking and displays one of his worst performances ever. Neeson is good, but looks old, and although is in character, seems misplaced. Maggie Smith is the same what you have been seeing of her in the previous two films. No change.With an annoying score and exasperating background music, the narrative makes its audience too uncomfortable to relish the few satisfying sequences. The dialogs, the cinematography, the acting - everything is bad. Luc Besson's writing is below par and so is the nobody's direction. The stunt scenes (one where passengers suddenly vanish out of cars involved in a highway pile-up) do not impress. The usual cop rookieness is all over the place.BOTTOM LINE: Except for the final few minutes of enjoyable action, Taken 3 is a disaster. There is no inventiveness one expects from a film of this genre. A follower should give it a try. But there's no way I would invest time on a fourth one, if it ever happens.Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES",Taken 3
45,The-Sarkologist,Don't expect the trail of bodies from the previous movies,8,16 January 2015,"Well, once again Megaton grabs the weapon of mass destruction that happens to be Liam Neeson and this time drops him in the heart of Los Angeles, though since in this film he has been framed for murder and in most instances he is being chased by the LAPD he unfortunately isn't able to go on the killing spree that he did in the previous movies. I guess that is not surprising because it looks like they have wanted to try something different from the previous movies so as to wrap up this action packed extravaganza.I don't want to say too much about this film though because there are quite a few twists in it and I really don't want to give all that much away because, honestly, it is a pretty good hour and a half of Liam Neeson running around outsmarting the LAPD. Okay, they had to throw an intelligent cop into the mix because otherwise he would pretty much be leaving the boys in blue (do they actually wear blue, or is that just a saying that is used down here in Oz?) scratching their heads and wondering where on Earth (or in Los Angeles) this highly trained ex-government operative is.There were a couple of things that I found a little annoying, one being a little confused recognising the main antagonist because he looked almost identical to a couple of other characters in the film. Also, there was a part of the movie where he suddenly jumps to a car chase, and I was wondering what actually tipped him off to pick this particular guy as the antagonist, and then start following him. It seemed as if it went straight from him escaping the police at the university to the antagonist, for some completely unknown reason, saying 'lets go to Malibu' and then having the Russian thugs running Neeson off the road. I guess they needed an excuse to have Neeson going from outsmarting the cops to actually killing bad guys (because come on, we can't have him killing cops who are just going about their job, even if they are chasing the wrong guy).Still, Taken 3 is still a pretty cool movie, and as mentioned, moves away from having a family member kidnapped to having Neeson framed for a murder he didn't commit. However, we couldn't have Taken 3 with Neeson just running away from cops, we had to have Eastern Europeans running around with Eastern European accents and Eastern European thuggishness for Neeson to kill, and we also had to have a machine gun fight to top it all off. However, the other thing that baffles me is why is it always Los Angeles? I'm sure that there are heaps of other cities in the United States for Neeson to run around doing what Neeson does best, but I guess it has more to do with all of the film studios being based here than any lack of variety (though Hollywood's imagination can be quite limited at times).",Taken 3

47,Reno-Rangan,Independently a fine movie rather being associated with TAKEN.,7,26 August 2015,"Actually, it was not a bad movie, I really enjoyed it. But associated with 'Taken' and being the third film in the series was the setback. Because unlike the first two films, this one was somewhat detached from the original theme. Except the cast from the previous two, the story takes place in a completely different platform. From all the three films, the phone call between father and daughter was retained, but was not effective as the first one which became just a trademark of the series, that's all.The first half creates the puzzle and next half solves it. As expected, it was a typical structure in this trilogy, but the last quarter was turned into something like 'Mission Impossible'. In 'Taken' films, Bryan Mills (our lead guy) works alone, but he formed a team with a tech guy and others. That does not sound good, at least tried to be different from the original movie.It is a little disappointment for 'Taken' fans, but you will have a best shot if you see it as an independent one off movie. Yes could have made a better action flick if it was not linked to it. Hope it all ends here like they have said. As a trilogy, it failed, or maybe we can call it a 50-50. But the first one was a masterpiece, a trendsetting piece.6.5/10",Taken 3
48,sol-,Took,5,31 July 2016,"Framed for murder, the former CIA agent from the first two 'Taken' movies evades police pursuit in the hope of unraveling the murder mystery himself in this third chapter in the action franchise. By all accounts, Liam Neeson only agreed to do the film on the condition that it would not be a hostage thriller like the first two movies and the fact that the plot veers in an entirely different direction renders it a surprisingly refreshing experience, far closer to a Hitchcockian wrong man thriller than the first two entries in the series. There is, however, still lots of action, and like with its predecessors, much of the action feels overblown. 'Taken 3' also suffers from both the recasting and entire rewriting of Xander Berkeley's character from the first film for no particular reason other than to offer some (not so) unexpected plot twists and turns. A sentimental song also jarringly breaks up the action around 25 minutes in. Generally speaking though, 'Taken 3' is not all that inferior to its predecessors. Neeson does well within the limits of the role with some good dramatic moments when he is not shooting everything up. The rapport between him and Maggie Grace is also as solid as ever, and while he does not have a lot to really do, Forest Whitaker makes a welcome addition to the cast. As far as mindless action movies go, this is decent stuff and it at least does not just copy the earlier entries.",Taken 3
49,Rodrigo_Amaro,Nice closure to the Taken franchise,8,1 July 2021,"Liam Neeson returns as former CIA operative Bryan Mills in ""Taken 3"" and this time nobody gets taken (almost) so they won't have to accuse him of bad
parenting. This time, Mills investigates the mysterious murder of his ex-wife (Famke Janssen), now married with a rich businessman (Dougray Scott); and
as for Mills daugther (Maggie Grace) this time she's spared from the risky moments and does not get taken (for a long while).Olivier Megaton's film is packed with intense thrills, good action moments and a nice entertaining plot but it does not achieve greatness thanks to a faulty
editing that doesn't allow viewers to watch the action or the fights properly (e.g. The road chase sequence is terrible to watch) with a shaky camera and
ridiculously fast cuts; and the story has some loopholes that can upset the more careful viewer. However, I was entertained, Liam always plays a good hero
and this time in the franchise besides the help of his comrades (Leland Orser, Jon Gries and David Warshowsky) but also from a responsible detective (the
great Forest Whitaker); and as for the story revolving the Russian villains the film made a fine surprise despite being slightly predictable.Neeson throws many punches and shots on the bad guys making of ""Taken 3"" a very good challenge for his character, who goes through a rollercoaster of
emotions and thrills, and like the other two films of the franchise it's all good to watch. The movie delivers a lot despite its problems, the editing
being the worst since everything is so fast and so furious it's hard to follow what's going on but thankfully the more dramatic moments are well
established. And action star Neeson always delivers solid heroic performances just Harrison Ford (of whom I could imagine being part of this trilogy).If you're looking for tangled webs, plot twists and plenty of action, fights and shootings, then ""Taken 3"" is for you. It certainly delivers lots of
great moments and revelations, and it's a nice ending to the fine characters created by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. Neeson finds the guy, hunts them
down and they'll certainly kill them. Thumbs up! 8/10.",Taken 3
50,tomgillespie2002,"Hopefully the poster is right and ""it all ends here""",2,16 May 2015,"Taken 3's poster contains what is one of the most reassuring taglines in cinema history - ""It all ends here"". After voicing doubts over the series' continuity in 2012 following Taken 2, Liam Neeson was convinced by producer Luc Besson and writer Robert Mark Kamen to return to the role of former covert operative Bryan Mills, the overbearing father with skills of a particular kind, once more. The film-makers seem to have learnt their lesson following the previous instalment - which did little more than repeat the events of the first film only with roles reversed - and have changed the formula. Yet, although nobody is 'taken' this time around and Mills faces his foes on home soil, due to sheer bad writing and poor direction, this is quite possibly the worst of the lot.After discovering she is pregnant, Kim (Maggie Grace) is visited by her father Bryan, who brings an early birthday present. Knowing her father has a gift for overreacting and extreme dramatics, she decides to keep the news a secret. Later, Bryan receives a visit from his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen), who confesses that her marriage to Stuart (Dougray Scott, replacing Xander Berkeley from the first film) is on the rocks, and that she occasionally fantasises about being with Bryan. They decide not to act upon their feelings until Lenore's marital situation is resolved. Bryan is later asked by Stuart to back off as he tries to save his marriage, to which Bryan awkwardly agrees. But after receiving a text from Lenore asking to meet up for bagels, Bryan returns home to (spoilers!) find his ex-wife murdered, and the police closing in around him.Taking a leaf out of the Fast and the Furious franchise's book, Taken 3 emphasises the themes of the importance and the fragility of family, and even brings Bryan's ex-CIA friends, played by series regulars Leland Orser, David Warshofsky and Jon Gries, to the fore to give the film a heist-y feel. But this requires a subtler brand of film- making, something that Olivier Megaton, director of Transporter 3 (2008) and Colombiana (2011), does not possess the talent to pull off. Everything is played out with all the complexity and grace of a soap opera, as Bryan plods along in a plot that doesn't seem to know where it's going, while the inept police on his trail are routinely battered and out-manoeuvred and lead investigator Franck Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) watches in awe like a child seeing Father Christmas.As the police never prove to be much of a threat at all, there's no real urgency or suspense to Bryan's innocent-man-on-the-run shtick, and no hint at any form of meaningful relationship forming between he and Dotzler. In fact, this may be the redundant role of Whitaker's career. The dodgy racial stereotypes are present again as ex-Spetsnaz agent Oleg Malankov (Sam Spruell) is thrown into the mix. We know he's Russian because he has ugly tattoo's, wears a gold chain around his neck with an open collar, and sits in hot tubs with each arm around a sexy lady. Megaton hasn't learnt his lesson from Taken 2, so the action scenes are again incoherent and blurred, inducing sea- sickness rather than thrills. There's very little to recommend about this movie at all, apart from perhaps (again) Neeson's performance. Hopefully Taken 3 has killed the franchise for good, and Neeson can move onto projects more befitting his own particular set of skills.",Taken 3
51,zkonedog,Out With A Whimper,3,2 March 2017,"Despite the fact that I was wary about seeing this movie based on word-of-mouth and reviews, I decided to give it a try because its immediate predecessor—Taken 2—had still held my interest. Though I wasn't expecting anything like the spectacular original, I was hoping that ""Taken 3"" would bring closure (as advertised) to such an interesting concept.For a basic plot summary (minor spoilersnothing not seen in the trailer), ""Taken 3"" sees Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) trying to reconcile his relationship with ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen), what with Kim (Maggie Grace) now being off on her own at college. When a meeting between the ex-lovers ends up with ""Lenny"" dead, however, Bryan is framed for the murder and must flee. On his tail is Detective Frank Dotzler (Forest Whitaker).The main, glaring problem with this film is as simple as it is obvious: In this trilogy, there really was only one excellent story to tell. In the first Taken, a unique plot is bolstered by very well- created characters. That EXACT same tact is used to create a carbon-copy sequel with ""Taken 2"". That flick still manages to be mildly entertaining because the characters are so strong. However, that well couldn't be gone back to a third time and have been believe-able. So, it goes off course and manages to get even worse. One could argue that only a exercise in screen writing perfection could have made this enjoyable. It was just running on fumes.Perhaps the most disappointing part of the experience, though, is that the trailer/advertising for the film depicts much more background on the Bryan Mills character. That is why I thought the movie might have some redeeming value, but it was not to be. That was obviously a ruse, as it doesn't come up in the film at all.It is also a bit disheartening to see the main actors of the piece try so hard but have so little to work with. The entire project is beneath Whitaker, Neeson is just a carbon-copy, and Grace absolutely acts her heart out in and provides really the only great scenes of the whole experience. I'm surprised she has not received more major roles in Hollywood after this franchise & LOST, as she is a great actress.Overall, ""Taken 3"" managed to suck every last penny out of a franchise built on a single story. In the future, when I recommend ""Taken"" to people, I probably won't even mention the two sequels (if maybe just to discourage their being watched). They just do not serve a purpose besides butts in theater seats.",Taken 3
52,Floated2,Above average though Entertaining,7,30 December 2016,"Taken 3 opens with a sort of turned over family soap opera within the Mills family. Daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is pregnant and unsure how to tell her father or her boyfriend. Ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) is unhappy with her second marriage and having fantasies about Bryan. But then things get dangerous when someone close to Bryan is killed, leaving him framed for the murder. He then goes on the lam with the police, lead by Detective Dotzler (Forest Whitaker), in hot pursuit. Bryan must evade them while tracking down the real killers at the same time. Much of the rest of the film is a cat and mouse game between Bryan and Dotzler. Although there was not much of a ""taken"" set in this film, there does happen to be one subtle close moment which is important in keeping to pay close attention.In the previous Taken films, Bryan kills nameless henchmen, however the body count in Taken 3 seems much lower. Naturally Bryan himself remains indestructible. As an entertaining and suspense standpoint, Taken 3 is better than Taken 2. The film feels more natural and exciting. The murder mystery which is the central point of the plot, was more intriguing and entertaining than in Taken 2. Even if it is predictable, the end result is well done. It has been confirmed there will be no Taken 4 and perhaps that is not a great thing.
=============As a rewatch (05/08/18') Taken 3 remains an entertaining and action filled ride, though with some flaws and not as consisted as the original. Taken 3 still is quite a fun watch. As a second rewatch (12/03/18') opinions remain the same for Taken 3. Although the film is quite silly at times it still remains highly entertaining and a fun ride.",Taken 3

54,leonblackwood,"Typical Neeson action, with a few twists. 6/10",6,20 July 2015,"Review: I never get bored of watching Liam Neeson kicking butt! In this movie he gets framed for a murdering his ex-wife, who he still has feelings for, so he goes on the hunt to find the true killers, whilst being hunted down by the cops. His daughters life is also in danger so he seeks help from his old combat buddies to fight against the Russian mafia. I quite enjoyed this movie because of the great action scenes and Neesons ""One Man Army"" mentality. The storyline wasn't bad and you do get to see more of an human side of Neesons ""Stone Cold"" character. I just don't understand why the baddies always have to be Russian! Anyway, Whitaker is playing his usual intense role as the cop heading his unit to catch Neeson, who keeps on slipping through there fingers. He does crack a smile in a few of the scenes, for once but his performance is the same in a lot of his movies. After watching the first 2 films in this franchise, it was good to finally see Neesons old unit play a part in catching the baddies. Even his daughter has a hand in hunting down the Russians but Neeson still has to risk his life to find the culprit of the brutal murder. When all of the pieces come together, the showdown at the end was great and the various twists made it a joy to watch. Basically it's what it says on the tin so if you was into the first 2 movies, you will know what to expect from this one. Enjoyable!Round-Up: At 63 years old, Neeson is still an impressive action man who has some great fighting skills, mixed with a intense persona. He's made over 90 movies in his career which started in 1978 in Pilgrims Progress and he has recently become a bankable action hero which is a great achievement for someone over 60. He has also played a part in some comedy movies like the Ted franchise, the Lego Movie, A Million Ways To Die In The West and Anchorman 2 so he obviously has a sense of humour under his hard man image. The movie was directed by a French director (Olivier Megaton) who brought you films like Taken 2, Colombiana and Transporter 3 so he's not new to making action movies. The great Luc Beeson, who brought you the brilliant Leon, also wrote and produced this movie and you could see a lot of his traits throughout the film. To be honest, I wasn't that surprised with the outcome of this film because all of them have the same type of concept with Neeson saving the day but I still enjoy them, along with the famous one liners which will go down in movie history.Budget: $48million Worldwide Gross: $326millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/ thrillers movies about a former CIA agent whose been framed for a murdering his ex-wife. 6/10",Taken 3

Not nearly as exciting as the slice of bread, right? Well, that's the general feeling this film exudes. That, and the consistent explosive wave of stupidity that looms over this family. Urgh. Mummy Mills comes over Daddy Mills' place for bagels but winds up dead (lucky Janssen...), to which the latter is framed for murder. He must find out who actually committed the crime before the police take him down. I don't know what's more sad.The fact that this series actually has a third instalment, or the fact that they never got to eat those fresh warm bagels. Aside from the odd scene that strangely captivated me with its butchered script, particularly between Bryan and Kim, there's nothing to recommend here. Megaton is back in mega fashion to ensure that the infrequent action sequences and overall direction have more jump cuts than a skipping rope competition. Neeson climbing over that infamous fence had approximately twelve jump cuts in three seconds. That's just insane! My eyes were staring blankly at the screen for the most part.Cars explode upon touch. No one can drive. And gosh darn it, Whitaker's character (with his elastic band fetish) devoured fresh bagels without Neeson. Rude! Fight scenes were cumbersome. The passage of time wasnseemingly lost in this story, I mean at one point we're on an idyllic beach for some obligatory waterboarding. Oh, and the mandatory phone call! This time, Bryan telling his daughter that her mum is dead. On the frickin' phone! C'mon. That is not the Bryan Mills from the first Taken who massaged his daughter's feelings. This is an enraged, insensitive and hungry Mills. Hungry for some bagels! It finalises in a shootout with a Russian in his unflattering pants, and for the life of me I have no idea why.This cash grab of a sequel marks an almighty low point in Neeson's filmography. No fault of his own though, as he is as watchable as ever (despite the carefree performance). But damn, this film just does not need to exist. Heck, its predecessor didn't either! Predictable, pointless and painfully nauseating. Atleast it isn't damaging European tourism this time. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to have some bagels and forget about this film once again...",Taken 3

58,jtindahouse,Simplicity gets it through,7,12 November 2015,"The 'Taken' trilogy has followed a very similar path to that of the 'Ocean's Eleven' trilogy. The original is brilliant, the sequel is far too complex and consequently fails and then the third simplifies things and is much better off for it. Liam Neeson is a big enough movie star to carry pretty much any action movie and while 'Taken 3' really could have been called anything (considering no one ever really gets taken) it was a fitting way to end a decent series which really revitalised his career.This one is very much about the action. The whole film is set in America this time around and there's barely any time between action sequences. The film is quick to get its story started and never relents from there. There's the usual suspension of belief required of pretty much any modern action movie but you can't hold that against it. After Neeson initially assured us there would be no third 'Taken' film only one of two things could have happened. Either they came up with a story that he decided needed to be told, or as they say ""money talks"". I suspect it was the latter but it still isn't a bad entry.",Taken 3
59,elshikh4,Tasteless Pizza !,4,4 June 2015,"Well, you can say that fast food is enjoyable. But, by all means, not this time!I think since (Liam Neeson) was extremely busy in 2013 and 2014, starring 4 movies and a stage musical, performing vocally in 4 animated movies and 1 animated series, and doing cameos in a comic feature, short movie, and TV show--(Luc Besson), the producer / co-writer of (Taken), decided to mix pieces of previous movies, to fix a new sequel, as fast as he could. And the result was sorrowfully this hasty, boring, and yellow B-movie mishmash / rehash. Or, in less words: this tasteless pizza!This is, again, the doomed family of Bryan Mills (Taken), where he's framed with killing his wife, and pursuing the real killer (The Fugitive, even with hiding from the police in a sewer pipe!), through numerous car chases, and a climax which involves a car chasing a plane (The Transporter 2 by Besson himself!). Let's say that the unoriginally of that package wasn't what bothered me. It's the dull offspring of marrying all of that!I couldn't stand cannonading us with that plot's negative points. Simple examples: Since the stepfather (Dougray Scott) did it for the wife's insurance policy, he should lie convincingly on Mills. However, the fool said to him: ""I told the police that you killed my wife to avenge you for sleeping with her, AND told the gang that you're after them to protect myself and your daughter from them""! It's like I wanted to hang you, and hug you, in the same time! Fairly, the one who wrote this is THE FOOL! The stunningly smart inspector (Forest Whitaker) discovers that the lead is innocent because the bagels were hot (WAW, a black Pink Panther, this is new!). In one of the car chases, Mills kills innocent people definitely more than the ones killed by the evil guys! The lead wipes the Russian mafia off the earth, though the police doesn't interrogate him about any murder he did while attacking their leader?! (WHO DIDN'T NEED TO BE HALF NAKED WHILE THE SHOOTOUT!). Then, when the stepfather kidnaps the daughter to wrap up the third act; it's the most obvious and tacky plot device ever used in the recent history of the American action cinema! By the way, why in the restaurant the inspector holds a chess piece? Did he find it there? Does the restaurant give a chess figure with every Happy Meal? Is it his toy that speaks to him since childhood, so told him about the genius ""hot bagels"" clue??Bryan Mills isn't that great character in the first place. He looks super, acts super, while he's more superbore than superman. He has nothing original, doesn't get harmed, and is devoid of humor (at least The Terminator got to crack lovely one-liners!). Which makes the only things to love about him are that he's dedicated ex-husband / father, and played by the great (Liam Neeson). Hmmm, not much in my book either. So that leaves us with his gadgets, edge, and martial arts.Though here, forget about creative or impressive gadgets. And as for his edge and martial arts, they don't truly affect. He fights tens of goons, faces hundreds of bullets, gets into glass, and survives explosions, however WITHOUT ONE SCRATCH OR A DROP OF BLOOD! This unbroken invincibility is offensively predictable, deadly tedious, and loses the human connect between you and him. Plus, if you looked at (Neeson), you would easily see how he was very uninterested in doing this movie, right in every shot of it. E. g.: observe him when he gets punched in the face, he has no pain at all on his features; as if he doesn't interest in giving a hoot!I believe that (Besson) is an action moviemaker cyborg that manufactures senseless and robotic action movies copiously per year. And this round, as a prouder / co-writer, he did it with no possible wit, much imagination, or cool anything. Mr. Not My Cup of Tea, aka director (Olivier Megaton), made a long soulless trailer of a movie, which was outmatched by the movie's own trailer. And that irremediable ""Yellow"" mania.. GOD! Why to fill up the whole image with that mawkish color?? If it's an artsy thing, to embody the heat and the humidity of the events; then it was overused to an extent that gave me sunstroke! (Nathaniel Méchaly)'s music is emotionally sterile, and out of the blue, leans to be as bombastic as (The Ten Commandments - 1956) music after the plane's clash! In brief, a frank and various blandness hit (Taken 3) in the gut, and (Taken 3) hit us back with it!It runs all along like this: Something we've seen before in much better movie, stupid plot point, and action sequence where the lead automatically prevails, all played with rapid-fire cutting so you can't think of, enjoy, or see, anything! It has nothing to be proud of. Maybe how the lead's car crashes the plane in the end. However, few moments later, you get beaten by that mega banal last line. So they'll name the baby after the late mother's name; Hurrah! If that isn't a hint to (Taken 4), and a new kidnapped Bryan Mills family's member, then it's an honest Hurrah!..I kind of like pizza. But not as cold, and already eaten before, as (Taken 3)!P.S: It only works if you imagined it all as a loose remake of (Meet the Parents), with the boyfriend as the comically miserable lead, who gets to meet his girlfriend's family, which consists of now-murdered mother, now-criminal step-father, and always angry, James Bond-like, father; getting suddenly stuck in the middle of their crazy violent hell!",Taken 3

Plot unevenness and dubious ethics are ""ironed out"" by good performances (Liam Neeson is always pleasant to follow; well, using Forest Whitaker as inspector Franck Dotzler was probably too simplistic here; female performances were just endearing) and visually catchy chases and speedings.I like that Besson and his co-workers do not make a bid for something profound and artistic, they just know the rules of thrilling entertainment, making a good use of it. Thanks to their notoriety, they are able to employ skillful and known actors, and the result is better much expected - a decent box office, meaning thousands of satisfied viewers.

Now the sequel nobody asked for titled Taken 2 not so much, everything that was good with the first film, was not in the sequel, Liam Neeson was alright, but action had too much close ups, and also too much shaky cam. And the storyline was a joke, the characters where so stupid they make cardboard cut outs seem more interesting. Not leaving much open for a third one.Bryan Mills is framed for murder of his ex wife, and quickly goes on the run, using his skills, he is hunted by the cops and the killer that framed him, will Bryan make it out alive? A little better then the last one, some fight scenes are well done, some shootout scenes are pretty cool, car chase moments in the film go a overboard, but at least the shaky cam is kept too a little bit. Liam Neeson doesn't seem to be happy being in this, and it really shows in his performance, but still is awesome. Forrest Whitaker is good but looks every bit has bored as Neeson. Maggie Grace surprisingly gives a good performance. Not great but alright, and still does not top the first Taken.",Taken 3
62,freemantle_uk,Utterly pointless,3,29 March 2020,The Taken series go from bad to worst with the third film being even more forced than the second.Taken 3 sees Bryan Mills getting framed for murder and has to go on the run whilst trying to prove his innocence. So it is basically The Fugitive made by hacks.Olivier Megaton is one of the worst action directors currently working in mainstream cinema and proven by his work on the Taken films. His approach for Taken 3 was to make a third rate Bourne knockoff and having his action sequence edited to hell. He doesn't even include anything as incredibly hilarious and stupid as Kim throwing grenades in Istanbul.Even though Taken 2 was a forced sequel at least it tried to be connected to the first film. Taken 3 had a stock plot that could have been applied to any film. So it can't even satisfy a completist or fan of the previous film (and they have properly seen the film already).This was a film that was only made for the money and give everyone involved a nice paycheck.,Taken 3
63,stevendbeard,Good Action,7,9 January 2015,"I saw ""Taken 3"", starring Liam Neeson-A Million Ways to Die in the West, Battleship; Famke Janssen-Jean Grey in the X-Men movies, The Faculty; Maggie Grace-The Twilight movies, Knight and Day; Dougray Scott-Hit-man, Deep Impact and Forest Whitaker-The Last Stand, Panic Room.This is the third and last-or so they claim- of the action/revenge series about an ex-CIA operative with a particular set of skills. This installment is directed by Olivier Megaton-his last name sounds like a transformer-who directed Taken 2, Columbiana and Transporter 3. It's written by Luc Besson-I love his work-who also wrote Lucy, Brick Mansions, the Nikita and Transporter series, both for the movies and TV. Liam plays the operative turned family man that just keeps having the worst luck. In the first movie, Maggie, his daughter, was taken. In the second movie, it was his wife, Famke. Thankfully, no one is actually taken in this one but someone is killed-and guess who gets framed for it? If you have seen the trailer, you probably have a good idea who it is. Anyway, Forest plays the police officer trying to capture Liam-Yeah, Good Luck there, buddy!-and Dougray plays Famke's second husband. Let's face it, this movie is not going to win any academy awards. But, it is a good action movie with lots of car chases, gun battles and assorted fisticuffs and if that is what gets you going, then you should like this one. It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 33 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Taken 3
64,alindsay-al,a poor end to this franchise,3,19 January 2015,"I am a big fan of the original taken film, I felt even though the premise was simple it was a unique experience. However, I thought the second one was distinctly average and had allot of problems. It is funny that the final installment in the franchise is actually the worst of the films. Instead of seeing somebody taken somebody close to Bryan mills is murdered and he is framed for it. So while on the run from the fbi he must clear his name, find the people who did those and protect the last thing he has which is his daughter. Now I feel like Liam neeson is the only reason that the second and third installments of this franchise get any positive reaction because he is great in the role. Sure he is the same as the previous films but it is great seeing him as Bryan mills and once again he does a good role in this film. The supporting cast though is nowhere near as good. Forest Whitaker plays the cop who is after him and even though I know he is a good actor he is just the most cliché character I maybe have ever seen. His character is just like every cop that has ever been in a film like this, also they decided to give him two ticks in a chess piece and a rubber band and boy does it get annoying. Famke Janssen is barely in the film so her acting talent isn't used in any way. Now for three films we have seen Kim get taken and survive and we are meant to care about her, but I have never liked Maggie graces performances in these films and this one is no different. They give her a completely pointless side story and in my opinion she didn't even need to be in the film. For the record I am not a fan of mission impossible 2 so when I saw Dougray Scott was in the film I groaned ad I knew he would play the same character as always and he does to your dismay. Now a little bit of credit has to go to the fact that they didn't stick with the kidnapping plot which was a good choice because that was getting boring. But the problem is that this story is a complete rip off of another film which I won't spoil and nothing makes sense. Their is a twist towards the end of the film which I predicted right at the beginning of the film and you will not care. The script is okay with liam neeson doing his best to sell his situation and make us care about him. But everybody else has boring dialogue and uninteresting things to say or do. What I loved about the first taken film was the action and how it was done but in the 2nd film and this one the action just sucks. This director just wants to be the next Paul greengrass and I am sorry he never will be. The amount of shaky cam makes it impossible to see the action that you came to see. Also it is clear that in certain points in the film there are situations that any person would have died but they never explained how Bryan survives. This was just because they felt the need to Hollywoodize this cash grab. Overall this is a poor film that really should not be watched.",Taken 3
65,estebangonzalez10,The Fugitive parody,4,26 January 2015,"""If you go down this road, the LAPD, the FBI, the CIA... they're all gonna come for you. They'll find you. And they'll stop you.""Taken 3 is less of a sequel and more of a parody of memorable action films such as The Fugitive and even the first Taken. I was a huge fan of the original which I even included among my favorite films the year it came out because I was blown away by Liam Neeson's performance and the gripping action sequences. I also admit defending the sequel, although it is a decision I regret now that I have rewatched the film, because I just loved the character that Neeson plays. I thought the idea of a franchise for Bryan Mills would be an awesome one, but you just can't continue making it revolve around his family. I mean his daughter should be in desperate need of a psychiatrist after everything that she has gone through. I don't know how Maggie Grace pulls it off, but she looks even younger now than she did 10 years ago when she starred in the first season of Lost. This time the plot revolves around Bryan's ex-wife getting murdered and him getting framed for her death. While being chased by the police, Bryan has to discover who was behind Lenny's murder. We've seen this plot played out many times before, but no one has done it better than The Fugitive. You even have Forest Whitaker here playing the smart detective trying to solve the case while he is chasing Bryan (similar to what Tommy Lee Jones did in The Fugitive). The villains in this film are probably the weakest element and are often laughable which is why I felt this was sort of a parody instead of an action movie. The action scenes are difficult to watch because the camera is moving all the time and there are over 50 shots every minute or so. There are also many unbelievable scenes which Bryan walks out of without a scratch, and we don't even see how he survives some of them. But somehow the climax outdoes them all in ridiculousness. Taken 3 is a huge letdown and hopefully the final film of the franchise as promised in the posters. Liam Neeson is an actor that I will always enjoy watching on screen, especially when making action scenes and threatening people over the phone. My only recommendation is that they don't show him running because it isn't one of his strengths. Unfortunately the film has so many shots and cuts that you can't enjoy Neeson fighting off the villains. Forest Whitaker is a great actor, but you can tell that sometimes he is just cashing in a performance. He is basically playing the same character he did in The Last Stand although this time he pays with a rubber band around his wrist while trying to solve the case. At this point I guess I would rather watch a film where Liam Neeson is threatening villains over the phone than actually seeing director Megaton ruining the action by cutting one shot after another every second. Fake Janssen doesn't get much screen time and I guess she bailed the franchise at the right moment. The villains have no personality whatsoever in this film (which I would argue is the case in the entire franchise, but at least they were threatening the first time around). The screenplay is full of plot holes and in the end you have to go through the tedious explanation of what we already know has happened just in case the audience was stupid and didn't understand what they saw. But perhaps they did it for those of us who may have fallen asleep during the action scenes because this is by far the longest film in the franchise and you feel it.",Taken 3
66,jimbo-53-186511,"Has some entertainment value, but it's clear from this film that the writers have simply run out of ideas",4,5 December 2015,"Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) returns in this third film as the ex-government operative with those 'special set of skills'. Things are going OK with Mills at the start, he's getting on well with his ex-wife Lenore St John (Famke Janssen) much to the annoyance of her husband Stuart St John (Dougray Scott) and Mills is also getting on well with his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) who has some 'big' news of her own that she wishes to share with him. Sadly, Mills world ends up being turned upside down when his wife is murdered and he's framed for her murder. Mills find himself on the run from the CIA and whilst on the run he's using his 'special skills' to track down who's really responsible for her murder.The original Taken Film for me is one of the finest actions films that I've ever seen. For me, it moved at a blistering pace and kept me on the edge of my seat as it was a real race against time type of film. I also liked the fact that the film explored 'people trafficking' and may have helped to make people aware of the dangers - it also made a social statement of sorts which is great. The second film was much weaker, full of plot holes and nowhere near as intense, but it still worked because it did still have the race against time aspect to the story - it's existence as a sequel could also be easily justified as it's believable that someone would want to get revenge against Mills for all the people that he'd killed. However, when watching this film I found it much more difficult to justify its existence.For a start this film has the 'Taken' name and whilst Mills' wife's death did occur as a result of her being Taken this is something that is merely used to the set the story up rather than being the focus of the film. The fact that someone being Taken isn't the main focus of this film wouldn't be much of an issue had the film had the same urgency about it as its predecessors, but sadly it doesn't and it is noticeably slower by comparison.There were other things that bothered me about this film such as the plotting; we basically see Lenore's husband Stuart getting involved in a business deal with some Russians that's gone pear-shaped and this has some connection with Lenore being killed and for Mills being framed for her murder. To me this is a weak reason for a third film as it has no real continuity from the second film (as far as I can remember). When watching this film it did feel as though it had only been made purely to make money. If we go back to plotting then it's fairly obvious that this film isn't that much different to The Fugitive (which again wouldn't be so bad if this film was exciting). Mills continually evading and escaping from the police grew tiresome - we know who he is and what he does by now so we know that this will keep happening? Some of the plotting was ludicrous (Mills not showing the police the CCTV evidence of his wife's abduction when they arrested him at the petrol station) or unconvincing - Kim eating a yoghurt with something that Mills had laced with something to make her feel sick so that she would go to the toilets at her school and then he would meet her there?? This seemed like a very round-the-houses and far-fetched way to arrange to get his daughter to meet him...... Another problem with this film lay with the camera-work which in some scenes was both dizzying and nauseating. The quick-cut scenes were also distracting and made many of the action scenes look rather silly. At times, when watching this film it felt like I was watching it whilst riding on a roller-coaster. Not a pleasant experience.Are there any positives? Yes, but not many. Neeson is always great to watch in his role as Bryan Mills and there is still fun to be had from seeing him going round kicking a load of ass. The film is quite entertaining as well. I also liked the bit where one of the Russians criticises Mills for his awful attempt at a Russian accent - it reminded me of his rather poor attempt at a Russian accent in K19: Widowmaker.The end suggests that there may be a fourth film in the pipeline - although if it does come along at least it will be able to be justified. However, my personal opinion is that the franchise has run its course and I think it's time that it was put to bed.",Taken 3

68,3xHCCH,Unworthy of the Original Film,3,20 January 2015,"""Taken"" (2008) was such a memorable action film. It brought Liam Neeson back up from his career doldrums and made him into a bankable senior action hero. Its exotic European setting, the frightening white slavery story, and the extreme violence of the action sequences made it a most memorable film. ""Taken 2"" (2012) was an okay follow-up, yet we already recognize that its formula is getting a bit thinned out. After watching the much-awaited ""Taken 3"" though, they really should have stopped while they were ahead.This third episode of the series was set entirely in the state of California. Our hero ex-CIA Special Ops man Bryan Mills gets framed for killing someone very close to him. He needs to figure out who really did the crime before the police catch up with him. That is all. It is as generic as it sounds. Furthermore, with the Russian hoodlums as the bad guys, it is just like any B-quality Seagal, Van Damme or Statham flick out there we have seen before.Totally gone are all the elements which made the first Taken film so memorable and special. The action sequences had no grit or realism. At no time did we ever feel that Mills was in any serious danger. There was even a scene where the bad guy was just wearing white Speedos while fighting Mills, which honestly had me chuckling in its supreme awkwardness. The car chases were so run-of -the-mill and disappointing. The fondness of the director Oliver Megaton for close-ups on the action scenes too much did not help.Liam Neeson acted like he was just fulfilling a contract here. He is usually good and reliable as an actor, but in this film, he looked bored and seemed to lack the passion he is known for. Maggie Grace is pretty but she sort of looked old to be a whiny college student. One look at Dougray Scott's face and you can already predict what his role will be. Sam Spruell An interesting addition to the cast is Oscar-winner Forest Whitaker as the senior police officer who tries to match wits against Mills. ""Taken"" should just have ended after the first one. The second one was passable. But this third one is totally unnecessary. It need not have been done at all. Esteemed scriptwriter Luc Besson should not have settled for such a lackluster final episode to end his action trilogy. No one even gets ""taken"" in this film at all. 3/10.",Taken 3

Turns out his boss owes the mobsters some money. So they call him and leave him a reminder in the safe.Now we're back to Brian's dull life. He's still crazy about his daughter who by now lives with a guy in a nice house. She just finds out she's pregnant but doesn't tell him. He still spends time with his lame friends who don't tire of advising him to get over his wife. Something he still won't do. She's still having troubles with her husband. One night he comes over to see Brian to ask to him to stop seeing her. He agrees. Next day she wants to meet him at his place. When he arrives, she's dead on the bed, her throat slashed and he's holding the knife. Police magically appear that very moment. They try to arrest him but he escapes to a safe room after a chase around some LA neighborhood.In charge of the manhunt is Forest Whitaker who's a match for Brian. While he does notice that something isn't right the setup, he still devotes all his energy and manpower to finding Brian, who in the meantime has to come up with complicated ways of meeting his daughter since police are tailing her.There are a couple of run-ins with the police as Brain starts to investigate the murder of the wife and he identifies some people who abducted her the day before. We know it's the bad guy from the intro. This forces Brain to work with his buddies and the wife's husband to get close to the bad guy. In the end we learn what the motivation behind the killing was.No one is taken in Taken 3. The whole movie takes place in LA, even though it's filmed all over the world for some reason. There are no bad guys going after Brian, just the police. Whitaker is always a good addition to a cast but he's getting sloppy articulating his lines. Neeson, while not as fragile as in part 1, nor as angry as in part 2, clearly isn't up to the task of running around LA and jumping off rooftops. I'm all for halting the Hollywood mania of casting teens for everything and giving adults a chance, but some day soon, this whole business of Neeson the action hero has got to stop. He can actually act, so there's no reason to keep him stuck in the action drawer.Another one who isn't up to the task is director Fontana, aka ""Megaton!"". He still hasn't learned to direct action movies. Granted, it has to be a pain to direct a violent PG-13 action movie, but here again, the action scenes are filmed so poorly, it makes you look forward to non-action scenes. In usual Besson-fashion the action is also over the top. There's a ludicrous car chase scene, which might actually be exciting if it weren't filmed so lousily. As in part 2, we learn little of the special skills that Brian supposedly has. He's bright, but so is Whitaker's character. This movie actually shines when there's no action but mental work involved. Another nice thing about it that's it's filmed during the day. No running around at night in the rain as Hollywood is so fond of.Unless Besson is willing to hire directors who know what they're doing, the Taken franchise would be better off done.

70,s3276169,Implausible Nonsense,4,23 January 2015,"Whilst Liam Neeson is always entertaining and well suited to the action genre given his on screen presence this film is, for me, the worst in the ""Taken"" series.The plot is replete with hoary clichés, dodgy businessman, Russian mobsters, predictable action set ups and much more you will have seen many, many times before. Its almost as if the writers were afraid to step outside tried and true action formulas for the series last flick.Casting these shortcomings aside what really dragged this title down for me was the utter implausibility of the whole scenario as presented. Any one of the actions taken by the hero of the piece, as played by Neeson, would have landed him behind bars for a very long, long time. Yet in spite of litany of crimes our hero commits as he seeks vigilante justice Neeson's character walks away scot free. Its idiotic and represents a sad end to what has, to date, been a genuinely entertaining series of films. Four out of ten from me.",Taken 3

To be fair this is actually better than the second film and Forest Whitaker is really good as the cop trying to find Bryan Mills ( no one has been taken !) but i think i would have preferred half an hour shaved off it but you can't have everything.A lot of the time i had trouble understanding what Neeson was saying due to his mumbling.

73,robertemerald,Hugely entertaining action romp,9,27 February 2020,"The secret to some of these high profile movies such as Taken 3 and the reason they work so well is the casting. From the tall and surprisingly lean Liam Neeson with his gungho mates and perceptive daughter, to the exquisitely evil bad guys, and even regarding the highly intelligent cop Forest Whittaker, all are perfect matches for the characters they play. There's some interesting colloquial details too, from hot bagels to a chess piece. It's the action that's supreme however, with Liam hurtling over fences and roofs, blowing up carparks and causing mayhem on the freeway that is priceless. Some great race the clock sequences and the odd twist as well. I took a point off for the script's dance around the fact of a divorce, and remarriage, and yet Liam still comes up the favourite rose in the x's eyes. I just didn't believe it. Taken 3 is in the top tier of recent action movies in my book, and certainly another example of wonderful action movies featuring Liam Neeson in recent times.",Taken 3

75,Seraphion,Still nice but a bit different form the rest of the series,7,13 January 2015,"In this third movie Bryan Mills had already divorced and his ex wife Lenny now marries a Stewart St. John. One night day Bryan gets a visit from Stewart asking him to stay away from her so that Bryan doesn't become a home wrecker. But the next day Bryan receives a text from Lenny asking to meet while eating bagels. Bryan goes to buy the bagels but he returns to find Lenny's dead body in his apartment with police storming in to arrest him. He soon escapes and sneaks into the police impound to download Lenny's car's GPS data. He finds that Lenny had traveled to a Rancho Berrago the night before, which is quite far from where she lives. Bryan tracks the place and finds a gas station on the road there. He goes to inspect the CCTV footage there and find that Lenny got abducted that night. But the police comes as he is skimming the footage and he lets himself gets arrested again.Meanwhile Bryan's daughter Kim is staying with Stewart who hires more bodyguards. The police tails Kim to find Bryan but with help from his friends, Bryan eluded surveillance and meets Kim in her school. She tells him how Stewart starts acting strange so he follows him. The bad guys who framed Bryan knows this too and they force his car into an accident. Bryan escapes the explosion and catches up with them and settles the score. He then confronts Stewart who then spills more information. Stewart had been dealing with an ex Spetznaz Oleg Malikov, and now Stewart owes Oleg big time. So Stewart suspects Oleg is on to him. Bryan decides to have a personal chat with Oleg. With help from his friends Bryan storms alone into Oleg's highly guarded apartment. Before Bryan kills him, Oleg opens up that Stewart is using Bryan to finish loose ends by killing him.At the parking lot Kim and Bryan's friend is with Stewart. They open Lenny's phone and find a text from Bryan's phone containing Rancho Berrago. Kim texts Bryan asking about this information, and Stewart realizes his plans are blown away. He quickly takes a gun and shoots Bryan's friend, and then takes Kim as a hostage as he goes to runaway with his private jet. Bryan reaches the truck and finds the mess. He then reads Kim's text and remembers that there was a time when he left Stewart alone with his phone when Stewart visited him the night before Lenny is found dead. Bryan chases after Stewart and crashes into the jet's front landing gear, and shoots Stewart as he comes off the plane.The story, and many other elements of this movie, feels very different than what we saw in the first two movies of this series. And clearly, this changes things up more or less to the bad perspective. From Paris and Istanbul in the previous movies, this time there's no exotic location elsewhere, just plain old American location settings frequently making appearance in other movies such as suburbs, mansions, penthouse apartment, and freeways. The title still retains the trademark one word and changing the previous title's number from 2 to 3. But this time there's really no one or nothing taken from Bryan Mills. This time he's framed for his ex wife's murder. This makes this movie falls into the more common among other movies of this kind. For newcomers to the series, this must feel as just another Bourne movie with with an old protagonist and a family value focus.The action parts still nicely retain the series main attraction on this part. There are still those neatly choreographed movements of attacking which look very efficient and effective. His movie sees more emphasis on gadgetry and information technology as well as Bryan being not alone in doing his job, which to me seem like nice and logical additions to the series. Yet the movie's action lacks those scenes of pure special forces skill stuffs. I still think the sequence in Taken 2 where Bryan tracks Lenny's kidnappers location by remembering his own blindfolded route and triangulating the exact position by asking Kim to throw grenades is just brilliant. Nothing in this third movie tops that particular sequence.The acting still gets it well in overall. Liam Neeson, with his third action release so far still is one of the great action actors around. Having Forest Whittaker as the police character, the complementary angle of the story as the police whom Bryan is running from, makes that angle something to be considered and not just a sweetener for the movie. Maggie Grace nicely reprises her role here that adds great sense of continuity with the two previous movies since Famke Janssen's character dies very early at the movie's beginning.Taken 3 (2014) deserves a 7 out of 10 score in my opinion. Although much of this movie feels different from its two predecessors, it still presents nice entertaining action sequences to watch. A recommendation is a yes from me because Liam Neeson can always be relied to deliver a good action movie.",Taken 3

Follow it up with a weak sequel that basically recycles the first movie. If the s3ckers actually fall for it, you crank out the third one and, if your luck is in, it makes a shytpile of money and you' go from pitching scenarios to head of the studio.Granted, there are some interesting moves here. Neeson's character is likeable and interesting. But the movie is wrapped up in unrealistic car chases and semi-r3trrded adversaries.Plus, we're asked to believe a geriatric Neeson is able to evade cops on foot. No. 1 he actually looks like he's shuffling. No. 2 they would have shot him dead. I mean, if there's one thing American cops do well it's shoot 1000 (ONE THOUSAND) fellow Americans dead EVERY YEAR. Am I supposed to believe they'd show restraint for an accused murderer who's on the run?We're also supposed to feel bad for whatshername when, in reality, she was in two scenes in the first one, and barely had any more to do in the atrocious sequel. So who really cares when she dies.Oh, and has anybody figured out that his daughter is 30-something? She was too old to play a teenager in the first one.

77,Rob_Taylor,...and I thought Taken 2 was bad...,5,24 January 2015,"I mean, it was bad, of course, but I didn't think this third movie could top it for badness, but it does. However, it isn't for the reasons most people have commented on here.Taken 3 is bad because it does the one thing an action movie should never do. It makes you sigh in relief whenever the action ends.It does this through the magic of editing. See, I can forgive the hand-held camera work. I can forgive the bad story and ridiculousness of the script and dialogue. I can forgive all that, if the action was just good enough to make me go ""Wow!"".Instead, thanks to insane short cuts in the editing suite, the action actually makes me go ""Ow!"". It really hurts my brain trying to make sense of a sequence of cuts so rapid most of them don't last even one second. By the time you've figured out what the scene is, it is gone, leaving you, the viewer with little more than a snapshot of what was going on in it. As a result, the chases seem like a series of still photographs held up in front of you for an instant and then torn away. All of the effort that went into the action sequences is wasted, because, honestly, you have little idea what is going on most of the time.All of which makes this a big fail as an action movie and leaves you with just the non-action sequences to 'enjoy'. There are plenty of these as well, but they aren't terribly well done. Mostly lots of inane chatter and fake emotion.The movie is a mess, frankly, and that fault can be laid at the feet of the story and the director. Olivier Megaton made a pig's ear of Taken 2 and he hasn't improved any in the intervening years. If anything, he's gotten worse. What kind of surname is Megaton anyway for a fifty year old man? Frankly, I think the movie would have been better directed by Kim DotCom.SUMMARY: Poor plot. Awful editing cuts that make the action unwatchable. Please don't let there be another one.

In his defense though, what's left to keep him interested? In the first one they at least gave his character some actual brutality and clearly established he was no one to mess with: in this one he just seems irritated that this is somehow happening to him for a third time. So he very, very slowly finds out who the main villain is (in a twist so transparant even the Mayas can see it coming) and then catches him, looking bored all the way through. The action scenes are really bland, the story is worthless, the dialogues don't even achieve the coveted ""so bad it's good""-label: even fans of the original (like myself) will have a hard time finding a positive aspect about this dud.

81,moviexclusive,"A shockingly disappointing finale, 'Taken 3' is a disgrace to its star Liam Neeson and an appalling display of ineptness by its director Olivier Megaton",3,7 January 2015,"To set the record straight, no one gets taken in 'Taken 3', a condition that its principal star Liam Neeson laid down before he agreed to return for this third and presumably final instalment. That is perfectly fine with us; after all, how many times can ex- Special Forces operative Bryan Mills find himself having to deploy his very particular set of skills after a member of his family is taken away from him? Indeed, that is not the issue we had with this utterly disappointing third outing, which totally squanders what audience goodwill the first movie had accumulated and its immediate predecessor had not yet depleted.Produced by French-based EuropaCorp, the Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen-scripted 'Taken' was one of the most notable action films in recent memory when it was released back in 2008. Key to its success was Neeson, whose viciously efficient qualities as the former CIA badass were excellent complement to the actor's natural gravitas and air of gentleman nobility. The inevitable sequel that followed four years later was a letdown to say the least; not only did it slavishly repeat the original's formula, it toned down the former's no-holds-barred brutality to make it more accessible to a younger audience, and in the process losing the former's gritty, visceral, and even transgressive edge.Unfortunately, fans of the original hoping that the series would go out on a bang will be sorely disappointed to know that 'Taken 3' is cast in the same mould as the sequel. There are plenty of gunshots but no sight of blood. There is hand-to-hand combat that plays out more like a playground brawl between teenagers. Even a torture scene that sees Neeson waterboard fellow co-star Dougray Scott is extremely tame in comparison with a similar and brutally memorable one in the first movie, that if one recalls involved the use of electric clamps that Neeson stabbed into his nemesis' thighs. Not that we relish the portrayal of extreme violence, but 'Taken 3' seem to know not the difference between being restrained and being dull.But the deadened violence isn't quite the movie's most critical flaw; that belongs unquestionably to its director Olivier Megaton. A Besson regular since 'Transporter 3', Megaton took over the reins from Pierre Morel on 'Taken 2' but has apparently learnt nothing from his previous directorial duties. If there was already a worrying ineptness to his ability to craft a proper action sequence in 'Taken 2', then this follow-up shows Megaton at his most incompetent.Clearly influenced by Paul Greengrass' frenetic shooting of the 'Bourne' movies, Megaton insists on flailing hand-held camera-work, frantic over-editing and claustrophobic close-ups to ruin every single action sequence in the entire f**king movie (and yes, it is indeed that frustrating to watch). A freeway car chase is reduced to a flurry of close-ups and rapid edits that bear no continuity or coherence. A confrontation in a liquor store between Neeson and some of the Russian mobsters who took his ex-wife's life is shot in such close-ups it is impossible to make out who is doing what. And worst of all, there is no climax to speak of – not when a shootout between Neeson and another group of Russian mobsters protecting their boss Oleg Malankov (Sam Spruell) is so poorly staged it makes not a single iota of sense, or when a race between a Porsche driven by Neeson and a private plane ends in an collision that takes out the plane's front wheel but leaves no one hurt.It is even more infuriating to think that Megaton manages to f**k up every single sequence when there aren't that many to begin with. Eschewing the simple set-up of the previous two films, Besson and Kamen have instead opted here for a more plot-driven narrative, setting Neeson up against Forest Whitaker's LAPD Detective Franck Dotzler even while the former hunts down his wife's killers. That certainly recalls the dynamic between Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in 'The Fugitive', but 'Taken 3' is nowhere as smart and Whitaker nowhere near as keen as Jones' ever was. Though Besson and Kamen's script opts for double-crosses, hidden agendas and whodunits to keep their audience's attention, it is quite clear right at the very start just who has been pulling the strings, a mystery that once solved makes the rest of the proceedings unnecessarily protracted.Not that it actually matters – while Neeson went about methodically tracking down his kidnapped family in the first and second movies, he rarely exhibits the same kind of discipline clearing his name here. Too much time is spent on emotionally hollow character relationships in the first act, i.e. between Bryan and his young adult daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), or between Bryan and his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen), or between Bryan and Lenore's current husband Stuart (Scott), while the second act is equally wasted on Bryan's strenuous efforts to contact Kim who is placed under the close watch of the LAPD. By the time Bryan actually gets down to investigating, almost everyone involved looks more keen on getting it over and done – none more so than Neeson, who looks tired and completely uninterested from scene to scene.Perhaps Neeson is all too aware that the 'Taken' franchise has completely sputtered out; indeed, 'Taken 3' plays almost like a parody of the original movie, which was to action fans a sheer unbridled delight for its realistic stuntwork and hand-to-hand combat. Both these elements are sorely and sadly missing from a movie that can't even get its priorities right, no thanks to the utter shocking ineptitude of its director. Like we said, no one in the movie gets taken, but little did we know that the title was meant to be a joke on its audience, who are literally taken for a ride here. Spare yourself the agony, frustration and disappointment, and just NOT get on in the first place.",Taken 3

Liam Neeson is as usual on the top. The action and especially the fight scenes came too shaky here. The story itself was average but took enough serious the emotional aspects. This is okay so far.

It's an unsatisfying end to a once good start.,4,7 January 2015,"Taken 3 tries to reinvent itself with contrived plot and ends up accomplishing nothing. The movie sacrifices its simplistic nature and opts for Fugitive knock-off plot, a change born out of necessity since the daughter couldn't possibly get kidnapped again. It crams too many subplots and expositions into a series that's not known for cerebral approach. When the characters need to explain every move they do for audience's sake, it's a clear sign that the plot has become too convoluted. The action sequences are also subpar with previous Taken movies, which ultimately makes it nothing more than generic action movie.Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is now framed for murder, he must clean his name by uncovering overly complex conspiracy. Liam Neeson certainly has the charisma to pull off crime thriller and he has done so, but Taken 3 relies too heavily on far-fetched scenarios and way too many coincidences. He crosses path with police on unlikely occasions, furthermore he involves in life-threatening chase or shoot out, this potential homicidal rampage will negate any effort to clean his name. Any plan concocted doesn't seem to have plausible ground, so there's no an intense revelation or dynamic twist to be had despite the early promise of slight mystery tone.It also lacks the unique flair previous movies had. Even Taken 2, which was an inferior sequel, had picturesque setting. Without Liam Neeson, Taken 3 might as well be a random movie from Cinemax. One thing that made Taken fun was it's easily accessible and fun, it's easy to root for the character. However, Taken 3 gives plodded story with barely any excitement. The latter half is dry, as the movie attempts to weave implausible plots and hopes audience will go along. Unfortunately, at this point it's almost exhausting to do so.It occasionally borrows aspects of mafia or heist element, which sadly never optimized upon. In addition of Liam Neeson, the movie includes cast of veteran actors such as Famke Janssen and Forest Whitaker, although they spend the majority of the script for narration and predictable lines. The action is decent sometimes, there are good fights here and there to at least salvage the movie. These are pretty standard though, since almost all of them are recycled stunts from previous titles.Taken 3 doesn't deliver in intelligent thriller nor does it excel in over-the-top fun.

Let's start off by saying this film was not bad, I had a good time with it. However, this film gives fair proof that the Taken series has reached it's retirement line. The action sequences, like in the previous two film, were good. On the other hand, they weren't quite as exciting as the ones in the previous two. The plot was entertaining, although a little clichéd. My biggest disappointment with the film was how the film becomes formulaic towards the end.

I lost track after the first car chase, but I don't think Mr. Neeson is up to killing as many folks in Episode 3 than he did as ""Bryan Mills"" in his two earlier outings. Being quite familiar with the safety performance of the cars on American highways today, it's quite clear that 8 cops and 12 civilians perished in that early freeway carnage. But the police honcho excuses Neeson's character at the end, knowing that polls show that few if any White U.S. residents believe American law enforcement is willing to or capable of matching actual criminals to their corresponding crimes.

It was such a gleefully unremorseful B- grade action flick that, even after a terrible second instalment, a part of me held out hope that this threequel might just regain the franchise's glory. It doesn't, quite the opposite actually. This limp, unintentionally laughable cash-grab all but destroys any credibility or goodwill the original garnered, putting its hand up as an early contender for worst film of the year in the process. After opening with an agonisingly awkward stuffed-Panda gag, it continues downhill with each new scene offering up something fresh to deride. The violence is ludicrously non-existent, the car chases are so heavily edited it's difficult to actually follow what is happening, and the plot holes are so large you could fly a 747 through them: and that's just the broad strokes. There's also the horrendous dialogue, the woefully misjudged R&B soundtrack and the bored-looking Liam Neeson to contend with, not to mention a ""twist"" ending you could pick simply by reading the cast list. But the height of its awfulness? Going to great lengths to explain – in flashback no less – just how lethal the villain is, only to see him miss Neeson with three magazines worth of bullets.

90,brchthethird,Time and money I will never get back,4,11 January 2015,"Call me a sucker, but even though a lot of movies get bad press for one reason or another, I still end up watching them just to see how bad they could possibly be. And usually I end up getting burned. That's essentially the experience I had with TAKEN 3. From director Olivier Megaton (COLOMBIANA, TAKEN 2) and writer-producer Luc Besson (LEON, THE FIFTH ELEMENT) comes the conclusion to the trilogy about Bryan Mills (a rather tired-looking Liam Neeson), a man with ""a particular set of skills."" As such we get a movie in which...nobody is taken and Mills shows off his other, not-so-bad-ass skills like detective work and illegally downloading police files onto USB drives. Granted, there is some action, but not nearly enough to really satisfy me (considering the previous two).The basic plot, ripped off from THE FUGITIVE instead of any number of Charles Bronson movies, is that Bryan Mills is framed for his ex-wife's murder and goes on the run while trying to prove his innocence and find the person responsible. I'll give credit to the filmmakers for doing something different so that this wouldn't be a ridiculous rehash of the previous two installments, but what they came up with still wasn't great. For one, it lost a lot of the inherent silliness of what worked before, and instead we're treated to a slower, more dramatic film that really doesn't fit tonally with what people have come to expect from this series. The story also doesn't make too much sense logically when you start thinking too hard about it. There also wasn't little tension because by this point, Mills is essentially indestructible and there is little doubt as to the final outcome or reason to care about the fates of the characters. It also doesn't help that the film is slackly paced.Acting-wise, nobody was really good and even Liam Neeson looked like he was pretty bored this time around. Maggie Grace returns as the world's oldest-looking teenager and her performance was just as risible as it was the first two times. Her boyfriend is now played by someone else, but who cares since he doesn't even play a substantial part in the story. Dougray Scott also joins the cast as Lenore's (Famke Janssen) husband. Even the villain was lackluster and boring, just a stereotypical Russian gangster (who has gunfights in his tighty-whiteys). Famke Janssen was serviceable as Bryan's ex-wife, but her part in the plot means she's taken (hahaha) out of the picture fairly early on and is essentially a non-entity. Forrest Whitaker also shows up to play the same character he played in THE LAST STAND. The cast should be ashamed of themselves, because this was clearly a paycheck gig for all of them.Moving on, earlier I mentioned that this movie was directed by Olivier Megaton. This is important because the man does not know how to direct action to save his life. Due to either crappy fight choreography or the desire to be ""current"" or ""hip,"" all of fights and chase scenes are shot in shaky close-up with ADD editing that obscures what's going on. At times, it was nearly impossible to get a sense of of who was hitting who and where, or what was happening in general. It was a problem in TAKEN 2 and it's even worse in this one. In particular, I noticed one scene shown in the trailer that was edited fairly decently, but was miserably chopped up in this theatrical version. Special effects, however, were pretty decent and there were a couple of explosions that looked OK on the big screen. That being said, this a PG-13 action film that neuters violence and its impact for the sake of ticket sales. There's also some ridiculous dubbing over of a few curse words that will probably be reinstated for the unrated/extended DVDNow, having spent most of this review ragging on the film, I will say that Liam Neeson was still somewhat entertaining and engaging as Bryan Mills. He gets a few good one-liners, and there some callbacks to the previous installments. I also appreciate the decision to try something different, a la THE HANGOVER III, although it worked a lot better for that film than this one. I still enjoy Liam Neeson as an action star (and as an actor in general), but hopefully this chapter to his career is over and he moves on to other projects more deserving of his talents. There is absolutely no way I can recommend you spend your money to see this in theaters. It's a VOD rental at best, and only if you enjoyed the first two. This is a borderline unwatchable, and also surprisingly boring, post-action movie with few redeeming features. The only thing it's going to take is your time and money.",Taken 3
91,saptesh786,Good Thriller !,8,3 January 2019,"Once again I am wondering for low ratings to such good thriller 'Taken 3 'as the movie is watchable . I agreed that there are some unrealistic situations as one can't trust, but thrill, tension and suspense are major part of the movie and will carry you within high voltage voyage of breathe holding actions. Moreover there are also one or two twists at the end. As me Taken is best, Taken 2 is average and Taken 3 is good. It is also appreciable thing that the main actor Liam Nelson is doing all his stunts own. Technology war is playing a big role in the movie. Intelligent hero with intelligent cops and clever villain are entertaining you till last. Leave aside unbelievable situations and enjoy thrill only you will definitely got a good movie not disappointing you.
Firstly I though there is a link of first two parts (Albanian brothers), but later found this is alike from it and we can hop that for Taken 4 to complete Albanian brothers revenge story.
I recommend for thrill & suspense. Go and watch. Not consider low ratings.",Taken 3
92,dglink,An Action Thriller with No Excitement and No Thrills,5,21 June 2015,"Liam Neeson returns for the third time as ex-covert operative Bryan Mills in ""Taken 3."" If there is any mercy, this dismal unwelcome installment will be the last in a series that never should have been. Presumably, Neeson and Forest Whitaker, as an LAPD police chief, were well paid for lending their talents and names to this formulaic sequel, because the film does nothing for their reputations. Director Olivier Megaton's direction is all senseless action and nausea-inducing editing that produces a total lack of excitement. The story-line is completely without plausibility, and the obviously aging Neeson performs super-hero stunts as though he were a man half his age. Cars explode and tractor trailers bounce along the highway crushing cars with each flip; the body count of innocent victims soars, while Neeson seeks his wife's killer and Whitaker seeks Neeson. Harrison Ford in ""The Fugitive"" similarly pursued his wife's killer with more credibility and less collateral damage.All of the actors herein look their worst. Neeson is tired and haggard, Whitaker sports a scraggly unattractive goatee, and the supporting players are so unshaven, craggy, and tough looking, viewers will have a hard time separating the goods guys from the bad; only the accents distinguish the rough unsmiling Russkies from the rough unsmiling LAPD officers. The acting is passable at best, although Neeson and Whitaker are pros and do retain their screen presence. However, the two actresses fare less well. Famke Janssen as Lenore, Mills's ex-wife, shows more emotion as a corpse than she does trying to express her marital problems and a longing to rekindle the fire with Neeson. Maggie Grace as Kim, Mills's daughter, is so bland and colorless, viewers will wonder why Neeson is so intent on protecting her.""Taken 3"" is a bottom of the barrel sequel produced for no purpose other than to capitalize on the reputation of the original film. With no suspense, no mystery, and no excitement, the film is nothing but a time filler for non-discriminating viewers. Better to re-watch the original.",Taken 3

94,rps-2,Appalling!!!,2,21 October 2015,"This looks like a good movie for about the first ten minutes. Then the non-stop mayhem, violence, gunplay, car chases and fistfights begin. Why do we wonder about the problems with guns and violence in the United States when its citizens (and its young people) are exposed to this sort of blood soaked saga at every turn. Thrills and excitement can make a great film but Hollywood perverts them, enshrines them, worships them, promotes them as a common and even desirable way of life. I was tempted to bail out at the first car chase scene --- there are several --- but stayed with it just to see how bad and perverse it would get. If the people behind this film had done The Good Ship Lollypop, it would have been armed with guns and torpedoes, wracked by fire and explosions, its decks awash and slippery with blood. Appalling!",Taken 3
95,TOMASBBloodhound,A little better than expected.,6,11 January 2015,"Every now and then, even The Hound dives into the multiplex with the masses and watches a new mainstream film. Along with recliner seats, you can even get a full meal served to you now. Who knew? Anyway, I had seen the two prior films of this series, and been reasonably entertained. Could a sixty-two year old Liam Neeson pull off another decent action film? How old was Roger Moore when he made A View to a kill? Well, this time we get more of the same car chases, kung-fuing, and shootouts. This time the car chases aren't as dramatic as they happen on wider American streets rather than the narrow, ziz-zagging streets of Europe. The violence is plentiful, but the PG-13 rating blunts its effectiveness. Gunshot wounds don't even seem to create blood, nor does a slashed throat. About the most disgustingly graphic thing we see is a crazed Russian shooting at Neeson while wearing a pair of tighty-whities. But what can you do? A movie like this cannot be too graphic. You have to accept that going in. As far as plotting, this time nobody really gets ""taken"". At least not for very long. Neeson again plays a free-lance secret agent type who may or may not be ready to re-kindle things with his ex-wife. It hardly matters as she is killed off fairly early, and he is framed for her murder. The wife is once again played by Famke Janssen, and I cannot tell if she looks more like Julianna Margulies from The Good Wife, or Renee from Mob Wives. Either way, she won't be around if there is a ""Taken 4"". Helping Neeson solve the crime and clear his name are his usual gang of former spooks, and his plucky daughter Kim. The film gets a nice boost from veteran actor/director Forest Whitaker as the detective in charge of bringing Neeson to justice. He basically plays the same kind of driven lawman that Tommy Lee Jones played in The Fugitive. That movie is a LOT like this one, by the way. I hadn't seen Don Harvey on the big screen in a long time. Remember him from Casualties of War? And I must say, I haven't heard the term ""Spetsnaz"" mentioned in any movie since Rambo III in 1988. I'll give the two writers they credited some props for digging that up as back story on their Russian villain. I guess, give this film a look if you must. It isn't boring and its kind of what you'd expect. If you liked 1 and 2, you'll like this. Taken 3 is being billed is the final episode of this series, but don't buy it. So far, its having a huge opening weekend, and I doubt the studio brass will be able to resist another one. How about someone kidnapping Neeson's new grandchild? Come on! You know some hack writer out there has already started a treatment based on that scenario! I'll give Taken 3 about six stars. The Hound.",Taken 3
96,RforFilm,Taken 3 only proves further that the Taken series only had enough steam for one movie,3,9 January 2015,"Action movies live on tropes. Lets see; there's the ""getting away from the police in the one second needed to loose them"" and there's the ""gun with unlimited bullets"" and probably the most overly used, ""the hero that can take multiple gunshots while the henchmen only need one"". This is not only something that is satirized in many sketch comedies, but it is often made fun of in the movies their in. These clichés have been used over and over again as a means to conjure up sequences for the screenplay much faster. No to the credit, writers are not best minds behind something action related; that falls into the directors hands.With a good director, you get good action. With good action and a credible actor, you get Taken. The movie opened up in 2008 and made surprising money at the box office. It wasn't a great movie, but I had fun. What I thought made the movie stand out more was that it was discussing the dangers of traveling and sex trafficking. In 2012, Taken 2 got audiences rooting for Liam Neeson again as he wasrescuing his kidnapped ex wife. It was a boring rehash of the original. It surprises me that we now have Taken 3 to close the trilogy. Bryan Mills (played by Liam Neeson) seems to have fallen back into his routine in the events before the first movie; He's still retired from the CIA, hanging out with his golfing buddies and visiting his adult daughter Kim (played by Maggie Grace). He still sees her as ""daddy's girl"" and even gives her a stuffed animal for her birthday. On the side, Brian is still communicating with his ex-wife Lenore (played by Famke Janssen), even finding out that she may not be happy with her current husband, Stuart. One morning, Brian receives a text from Lenore that they need to talk. He grabs some bagels and arrives back to his apartment to discover her dead body on his bed. While contemplating over his love, the police swarm in, obviously arresting him for murder. He pleads that he didn't do it and escapes into the sewers. Police inspector Frank Dotzler (played by Forrest Whitaker) seems determined to find Brian, even though he may have second thoughts when Brian doesn't fire back on the police in his escape. Brian uses his CIA spy skills to track the real killer before he tries to strike his daughter. What surprises me about the whole Taken franchise is that they even made sequels. I think that there was only enough steam for one movie. The last movie was a boring rehash and this oneis just boring. While I'm glad they tried to do something new, Brian's scenario of proving his innocence is The Fugitive set up that's been done many times before. I wouldn't mind if the setup had been more interesting, but I could care less about his wife, as I never got to know her in this movie, let alone the others.The Fugitive may have given us little time to get to know Dr. Kimble's wife, but that movie had some fun action. I would have been more open to Taken 3 if the action at least been enjoyable, but it comes off as more run-of-the-mill. I blame the director for giving us some non imaginative sequences (with the exception of a couple of car chase sequences) and an escape story I could care less. I like Liam Neeson and I hope that this Taken movie is truly the last of the series. He just seems as tired of it as I am.I'll give this three bagel bags out of ten. Writing this, I can barley remember much of the story and I don't think any research is going to change my opinion. 20th century Fox needs to take away Taken from it's roster and search for another action story.",Taken 3
97,bankofmarquis,A water-downed FUGITIVE,6,12 January 2015,"I saw TAKEN 3. Do you know what was TAKEN in this movie?My money.This movie is nothing more than a water-downed version of THE FUGITIVE with Liam Neeson in the Harrison Ford role and Forest Whitaker (for some reason) in the Tommy Lee Jones role.I go to the TAKEN films to see Liam Neeson use his ""particular set of skills"" to rescue a family member from the clutches of some evil European bad guys amongst the backdrop of some vaguely Eastern European cities. What I get in this movie is Neeson getting framed for his wife's murder and having to outsmart Forrest Whitaker's team while piling up multiple car crashes and property damage in good ol' L.A while trying to clear his name. Despite a fun shoot out/car and airplane chase at the end, this movie just doesn't have enough going for it to have me recommend it.Director Olivier Megaton (I'm not making that up) while not a fan of character development, is a HUGE fan of the quick cut/shaky cam. It was on the end of nausea for me. He even trotted out good ol' shady businessman Dougray Scott. Is Dougray a good guy caught up in a bad situation or...Curiously, Wallace Langham (TV's original CSI) shows up in a cameo as ""that guy who gave Neeson a ride"". Not sure why he was there. Did he owe the director some money?One positive thing to mention in this movie is that Neeson's 3 ""spy buddies"" - David Warshofsky, Jon Gries and the always watchable Leland Orser - get much more screen time. I want to see a movie about these 4 working a job together.I just don't want to be TAKEN like this again.6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Taken 3

Now, it is up to Bryan to evade the cops led by Franck Dotzler(Forest Whitaker), find his ex-wife's true killers to clear his name & protect his daughter, Kim Mills(Maggie Grace). Taken 3 is an action packed & thrilling movie. The action sequences are tense, edge of the seat & have been superbly crafted. Taken 3 is better than Taken 2(2012) but, doesn't quite reach the heights of Taken(2008). The chase sequences are breathtaking, especially in the climax of the film. A note on the performances. Liam Neeson is outstanding as Bryan Mills. Forest Whitaker is great as Franck Dotzler. Famke Janssen is impressive as Lenore St. John. Maggie Grace is spectacular as Kim Mills.

100,bob-the-movie-man,Disappointing and unrealistic sequel,5,13 January 2015,"Liam Neeson returns to the role of Bryan Mills, a government operative with a ""particular set of skills"", who gets framed for the murder of one of his nearest and dearest - - I don't do spoilers, but the trailer neatly does: thanks a bunch trailer! Knowing his innocence, and not taking any s**t from anyone, Mills goes on the run to get to the bottom of who framed him and make them pay. Hindering Mills more than helping him is police chief Franck Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) who is not only dogged in his pursuit of Mills as the key suspect but also extremely smart, trying to piece together the complex three-way relationship between Mills, his ex-wife Lenore (Bond-girl Famke Jansson) and her current husband Stuart (MI-2's Dougray Scott). Staying just one step ahead of the pursuing cops, Bryan's focus rapidly turns to his daughter Kim Bauer - oh, sorry, wrong franchise - Kim Mills (Maggie Grace) and keeping her safe from the bad guys.Taken 2 was an energetic roller-coaster of a thriller also directed by Olivier Megaton (note: not his name at birth!) and to give Taken 3 a bit of credit parts of this film - following a painfully slow start with a lot of wordy exposition - live up to popcorn-munching past glories. Some of the lines - especially those of the whip-smart Dotzler - are entertaining. And, in particular, Neeson does a very amusing variant of his famous 'telephone answering message' at the denouement of the film. Apart from a damp squib of a final scene (probably hastily written as they were in the pub) the script by the same Taken team of Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen is passable.In general though, this film is all over the place.Editing is of the frenetic Bourne variety but not to the same standard: a specific and horrible example is an early car chase which is almost incoherent in the way it is staged and cut together. And whilst a lot of the staged violence in the first two films was over-the-top escapism, some of the action in this film makes no logical sense whatsoever: I could perhaps believe that body used as a shield might stop a handgun bullet - but a high powered sub-machine gun? Please! To top this off, two separate incidents with Mills in exploding cars simply defy any possible suspension of disbelief: this was more like Neeson in a film remake of the ""indestructible"" Captain Scarlett TV series than a supposedly realistic film.This may be a personal view, but I have a long-standing loathing of the movie trait of bumping off a key character at the start of a sequel after you, as the viewer, have invested the emotional energy in the previous film rooting for them to survive. (Alien 3 is probably the most heinous example of this crime, with the first-reel death of the little girl 'Newt'). Adding a final-reel tragic twist (as in Skyfall, or The Amazing Spiderman 2) is fine in my book. But this particular type of cheap storytelling trick just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.So go and see Taken 3 if you are happy to park your brain at the door and buy a bumper box of popcorn, but this is far from a classic and is a particularly stark coming down to movie-earth for me two days after watching the brilliant ""Whiplash"".(If you enjoyed this review please see my other reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to receive future posts.

Homicide Detective Inspector Dotzler (played by Forest Whitaker) seems to think the evidence against Brian is a little _too_ good. Still, he's duty-bound to go by the letter of the law in trying to arrest Brian, using any means necessary. And, frankly, he does a way better job of playing cat-and-mouse with Brian than that crooked French cop in the first film!

102,Likes_Ninjas90,Crash lands into familiar idiocy,1,7 January 2015,"Listen to me very carefully. There is a price on righteous justice to be paid in the movies today. After the September 11 terrorist attacks Americans are highly willing to pay for films which will counter their fears of foreign threats and attacks on the homeland. It's like therapy with machine guns. The first two Taken films, starring Liam Neeson as a former CIA agent who rescued his family from Albanian terrorists and human traffickers, were extremely bankable. They earned over $600 million dollars at the box office from a combined budget of a meager $70 million. Non-Stop, where Neeson played a US Air Marshall stopping terrorists on a plane, collected over $200 million singularly at the box office.Neeson was born in Northern Ireland but now plays American characters. He has the star power to sell these films back to American audiences. At 62, Neeson ranked 7th in Forbes' Forbes' list for Hollywood's Highest Paid Actors 2014, ahead of younger stars like Ben Affleck, Christian Bale, Will Smith and Mark Wahlberg. He is bankable because the films he makes are channelling conservative values and protection of the American homeland. The Taken series is a right-wing male revenge fantasy and while we write these films off as silly and puerile they're influencing how Americans are seeing the world.Though Taken and Non-Stop are highly geocentric they're directed and produced by European filmmakers. The first Taken was directed by Pierre Morel and its two sequels are by Olivier Megaton. Both men are French, as is the series producer Luc Besson (Lucy, The Fifth Element). Non-Stop was directed by Spanish filmmaker Jaume Collet-Serra. They've found ways of selling the perceptions and fears Americans have back to the same impressionable audience. Recently, Neeson conceded he's received letters of concern about his films. A South Texan teacher was taking sixty students to Europe on a trip and forty of them were removed by their parents, citing the Taken films for their withdrawal.Hopefully Taken 3 marks the end. Bryan Mills (Neeson) is struggling to reconnect to his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), now grown up and secretly pregnant to her boyfriend. Bryan is also rekindling his ex-wife Lenore (The Wolverine's Famke Janssen), unhappily married to Stuart (Dougray Scott), but he won't move until they're separated. After buying some bagels (important) Bryan returns to his flat and finds Lenore has been murdered. The police arrive immediately and prepare to arrest him for the murder. He escapes arrest and sets off to find who killed his wife and framed him. Dotzler (Forest Whitaker) is the inspector chasing him, and comes to the Sherlock-like conclusion Bryan might be innocent after all. In the last portion there are hilariously sleazy, drunken Russian mobsters who will receive their comeuppance. Since there's a push to sell these films to Middle Eastern countries, the Russians are the baddies again. Put that in your pipe Putin.What starts off as a fairly safe and bland family melodrama crash lands into familiar idiocy. The plot, including various twists, motives and doublecrosses, is laughably convoluted and stupid. The characters are still outlining revelations to each other once the gunfire and smoke has cleared. The screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen is also full of unintentionally funny lines like ""These guys could lose a tail if it was on a dog!"" and Dotzler explaining how a man who buys warm bagels wouldn't commit murder. Liam Neeson growls and scowls his way through scenes with dull expectancy and Forest Whitaker brings no distinction to the same character archetype Tommy Lee Jones played in the superior classic The Fugitive. He's left to pursue Bryan down corridors and serves little dramatic purpose since we already know he's innocent. Maggie Grace at least tries to bring some emotion to her limited part of running and crying. Megaton has no grip on the action. The chase scenes are horribly framed and photographed and generate no tension. The camera spends most of the time in close-up shots or waist level and the wobbles and fast cuts are so uncontrollable most action scenes are a blur. In an early race through the backstreets and over fences I couldn't tell if Neeson was present in the scene or if his ageing joints have finally given way to a stunt double. If he's not doing the action sequences himself then what's the point? He's the one a lot of Americans want to see saving their hides.",Taken 3

104,Darkside-Reviewer,Their Taken the Smeg!,5,19 May 2021,"Taken 3 (2014) is by far the worst entry in the Taken movie trilogy. The first two Taken films had a unique style to them that combined fast paced action together with clever storytelling. A large part of what made the first two Taken films so memorable was Liam Neeson's character Bryan Mills. Neeson's character is written almost like a modern day James Bond, a smooth talking ex special forces agent with a unique set of skills. Liam Neeson was the only reason anybody went to see Taken 3 just to see Neeson kill some more bad guys while acting like baddass.The plot of Taken 3 is a little different from the first two films instead of Neeson's character going after some bad guys who abduct his family this time he's being hunted by the police for a murder he didn't commit. At first this storyline seems like it might lead to something new and interesting with Neeson's character using his skills to solve his own murder case while playing catch me if you can with the police. Sadly it becomes painfully obvious about twenty minutes into the movie who the real killer is making the rest of movie feel like a complete waste of time as we are forced to watch Neeson try to figure out who set him up for murder when the audience has already figured out the obvious twist before the murder even takes place.This film ""Co stars"" Forest Whitaker as the lead detective assigned to track down and arrest Neeson's character. Forest Whitaker is a very talented actor who's talents are completed wasted in this movie when all his character really does is spout out exposition dialogue, eat bagels and say lines like ""send backup"" and ""what kind of a man buys hot bagels, then comes home and commits and murder?"". There's seriously only one scene in the entire movie where Neeson and Whitaker are in the same room together.There's still plenty of action in this movie however most of it consists of car chases and Neeson's character basically just beating up and almost killing innocent police officers for just doing their job. The only decent action scene in the entire movie takes place during the last twenty minutes of the movie when Neeson's character fights a Russian gangster who fights hand to hand in his tighty whities.Taken 3 is nothing more than a quick cash grab made primarily to cash in on Neeson's most successful character role before he gets to old to make sequels. I don't recommend paying to own this movie on Blu Ray or 4K-ULTRA HD save yourself some money and watch it on a streaming service like Netflix.",Taken 3
105,anselmdaniel,The worst in the franchise,3,25 February 2019,"This review contain spoilers.Taken 3 premiered in 2014 and is the sequel to Taken 2. The movie is directed by Olivier Megaton and written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. The movie stars Liam Neeson in the leading role once again with Famke Janssen and Maggie Grace reposing their supporting roles. Bryan is setup for a crime and Bryan must evade law enforcement and clear his name.Taken 3 is a mess of a movie. Despite most of the production returning, the movie feels much worse in quality than the last movie. The second movie was already suffering from problems in the plot. This was made much worse in the third installment. So many plot points feel incredibly contrived and implausible. This hurt so much of the movie that it became laughable to watch. I could not believe much of the insanity put on display here. Bryan Mills became superhuman in his ability to predict human actions. Somehow he is able to get his daughter to one specific location with a special drink. The police are also given the motivation to hunt Bryan Mills even when it seemed implausible. The movie is filled with these writing contrivances that make
it difficult to enjoy the movie.The editing and direction are terrible in this movie. Olivier Megaton should have improved from the second film but this is not the case. The action has gotten much worse as the movie relies too much on quick cuts. These cuts made it hard to follow the action that is really not that impressive. The movie is a hollow shell of its much better early installments. I wish I that the action was directed in a more competent manner, but it is not. The movie could have easily redeemed itself to be watchable this way.Taken 3 destroys it's earlier legacy. Bryan Mills becomes a joke in this movie where his hyper-competency is so exaggerated that it resembles a parody of the earlier movies. This was entertaining at first but became tiresome as the movie went on. Even Lenore's death is not handled with much tact other than to contrive a reason for Bryan to be hunted. This is one of the worst reasons to have a character die. The movie tries to wrap up the series but it feels incredibly forced.I highly recommend not watching 'Taken 3.'Grade: F",Taken 3

107,dfa120374,Still Pretty Decent But It's The Weakest Of The Trilogy,6,9 November 2015,"Here we have the 3rd installment of the Taken series and while it's still a decent action film, it's definitely the worst of the trilogy, but like the 2nd film, I think it's been ruined in a way by it being cut to reduce it from an R-Rating to a PG-13. The 1st one was an R so it's pathetic that the studios wanted a tamer PG-13 for the sequels.Anyway, for what it's worth, Taken 3 still isn't too bad. There's a decent amount of action throughout, and there's a good cat-and-mouse thing going on between Mills and Det. Dotzler (Forest Whitaker).I didn't read about the film or see any trailers so I did wonder what the story would be this time because I did think it would be a bit much if Lenore or Kim (or both) had been taken again, so it was good they went with a different angle and made it about a gang of Russian mobsters. For people who think this story came out of nowhere, think again because it ties in with something that Mills told Stuart in the 1st film with regards to an oil deal involving Russians.While I quite enjoyed this 3rd film, like I said earlier, it wasn't as good as the 2nd and definitely not as good as the 1st. It doesn't have the grittiness of the 1st film, but for a no-brainer action film it's still decent enough. The cast all do a fine job as well and it's still amazing to me how Maggie Grace still manages to play (and pass for) a female character that is about 10 years younger than her real-life age, but she does.Just as a side note, I have to laugh at people moaning about Mills not being prosecuted for the damage caused in looking for Malankov as if this is some sort of true to life Documentary! How many other films have we seen where the hero causes mayhem, accidents, millions of $ worth of damage, etc in trying to get the ""bad guys""? Countless, yet all of a sudden some people moan about it here. Laughable.Anyhow, if you enjoyed the 1st film, liked the 2nd one then give this a go...you never know - you may just enjoy it as well.",Taken 3
108,billygoat1071,Trouble in Style,4,17 January 2015,"Taken 3 is said to be the final installment of the franchise and this one somewhat abandons its original formula and instead makes a rip-off of The Fugitive. Cases like this could make for a grand conclusion for this series, otherwise a fresher take since the kidnapping plot already gets tired in the last one. Here, it heightens the scale, but lessens the brains. There's plenty of dumb choices for the hero to take his redemption, only to set up an exciting thrill chase, but even those chases are unable to be fun, due to its direction that tries too hard to be cool, ends up being incoherent. Taken movies used to be all simple fun, but this part is probably too complicated to appreciate.Taken movies no longer aims the straightforwardness, neither the context of the original. It has always been about Liam Neeson beating up bad guys no matter how high the stakes he is into. While it's still pretty fun to watch Neeson doing the best he could do as an action hero, the movie somehow lost the senses of this character. Mills used to be a clever fellow who can get away from anything out of desperation, but here he does one of the most unwise decision he's done to himself in a situation. He basically makes everyone's accusation to him as a criminal even worse. He just couldn't do anything basic, his actions always have to unreasonably lead to a disaster. At least in the past movies we can understand why he hurts his enemies without any remorse. Here, he looks more like a villain now who's just doing things foolishly, in spite of his good intentions.But mostly, we don't need to care about that, the only reason why the movie has to go through to that absurdity is to make it a lot exciting. There is some set pieces that look like a fun ride, especially how awesomely shot those sequences are, but the fast paced editing hurts every action scene, unable to focus in many of its angles. It just keeps finding the coolest image that the scene could find and crammed altogether in every one or two seconds. It's rather hard to follow and can even cause motion sickness. Besides, the new plot doesn't really offer much of these chases, since it keeps stalling in scenes of exposition and buildups.Liam Neeson hasn't lost his enthusiasm, at least, but the talent deserves better than what the movie has done to itself. Taken 3 is a rather difficult thing to experience, not because it has a brilliantly complex story, but because of its lacking consistency, while the action looks larger and stylish than ever, it still doesn't make for a good replacement of better action filmmaking. It could have been the typical dumb fun, but the fun is compromised thanks to its supposedly exciting editing. There's nothing much left to remember here than that.",Taken 3

I actually had hope for this one because it looked like it was going to do something newI never should have got my hopes up.Granted, the film has a great fight scene in a liquor store, Forest Whitaker gives off a great performance, and Liam Neeson still kicks butt as Bryan Mills but the film is way too predictable and formulaic. The true party responsible for the murder of Mills' ex-wife is excruciatingly obvious and, even worse, the plot actually gives Mills a stupidly sound alibi that makes the frame job pointless, proves that he would have been ruled out as a suspect early on and, ultimately, makes every decision Mills makes a completely waste of time and police resources.I thought this film could have breathed new life in the franchise and been the sequel the second should have been but, ultimately, it felt just as pointless and nowhere near as badass or entertaining as the first film.Greetings, Earth-dwellers!

But, I liked the original very much. I should have known, when I saw that this film was directed by Megaton. He could not direct his way out of a paper box. The direction was so clumsy, so plodding, so without personality, character, development, continuity, that it was just a jumbled mess. His work in Colombiana was decent. It was a watchable film. But, his other work? Wow. The multiple car chase scenes tried to make up for the lack of story. The editing and cinematography were truly inferior, and very jumbled. And did I mention Whitaker? Has he forgotten how to act? That bulging eye routine is getting very old. No nuance whatsoever to this terrible performance. Please, do yourself a favor. Do not see this movie. Stay home.

It moves away from the one hit pony of the ""particular set of skills"" speech that made Bryan Mills an upcoming icon, just slightly enough without completely selling out. It caters more to it's shinning star, Liam Neeson and the type of thinking man's action hero type he's been popularizing since the first Taken. This time around, Brian Mills has to deal with his ex-wife Lenore, played once again by Famke Janssen, being taken for the very last time. He's framed for her murder and Mills must hunt for the real killer and keep his daughter from being taken again, while being hunted himself by the LAPD lead by Forest Whitaker.As the hunt happens we get to know Mills just a little bit more just like a good sequel should.It's action packed, and it's about watching him work as a seasoned spy with his team of friends that have made appearances in the other films. It's also about how he oddly balances this life with the relationship of his daughter whose getting to use to this.

114,osj2507,Splendid action entertainment,7,25 January 2015,"Even though this third installment could be seen to be very similar to the two earlier films, I think that is positive actually, it delivers action at a very high speed through out the entire film. I was very much entertained, the hard Bryan Mills played by Liam Neeson delivers a good performance, this time it is himself that gets into trouble and not his ex wife or daughter, it actually works out quit well.A nicely done Action movie, with a very typical high speed in all the scenes where somebody is being chased either on foot or in a car. There is a lot of shifting camera angels and cuts, it is very typical for this kind of action movie, but in the chase scenes it can be very confusing to keep up. It delivers good action in fight scenes, but also in gun fights, explosions, car chases and much more, we as the watcher are kept busy in following the constant changes. The hard attitude is off course also there, delivered by Liam Neeson, but this time we also get to see some more of Bryan Mills former colleagues, they have to step up and help out now that Bryan is a hunted man. It has a couple of twists and it really suits this third film, in the earlier ones it was very clear for most parts who the bad guys we were chasing was, in this it not until the end we get the entire picture.I am not so sure about the subtitle for this film will actually be true, it has earned itself in and is still popular around the world, so maybe we should get used to the idea that there will be one or more in the series about Bryan Mills, as long as the big Irish guy doesn't get too old for the part :)",Taken 3
115,MattBrady099,Milking the series,4,15 January 2015,"The Taken series is the new Hangover films, they just never going to stop.The story is about Bryan Mills, whose reconciliation with his ex- wife is tragically cut short when she is brutally murdered. Consumed with rage, and framed for the crime, he goes on the run to evade the relentless pursuit of the CIA, FBI and the police. For one last time, Mills must use his ""particular set of skills,"" to track down the real killers, exact his unique brand of justice, and protect the only thing that matters to him now - his daughter.I can't believe a good film like the first Taken then get squeal's that can turn into a train wreck of a cash grab. I remembered in the first film how brutal the fight scenes where and that's due to the sound in the movie. Every punch sounds rock hard and you can hear all the bones breaking in they bodies, but then Olivier Megaton took the directors chair and I wish he haven't, because Taken 2 was terrible and so was this one.Olivier Megaton should just stop directing action films. He can't do them right and he's direction for action always feels badly edited and sloppy paste. I thought he learned his lesson by now since everybody talked about how crappy the action was in the second film, but nope, he has learnt anything from his first mistakes.The action in this movie is some of the worst action I've so far this year. It's the quick cut editing so that means you can't see a damn thing when a action scene comes on. Quick cut after quick cut, it's just painful to watch. How I am I suppose to enjoy the action when most of the time I can't see it and I would blame it on the editing which is just shockingly bad, I mean wow.The only good thing in this movie: Liam Neeson in this movie is just playing the basic Liam Neeson, once again. He doesn't do terrible job in this film but I can tell that he doesn't want to be in this, it's all about the money to him.

116,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Just your average action cash-cow flick, nothing more or less",5,17 February 2015,"Bryan Mills is back to take things into his own hands to save the day.Taken 3 is your average sequel of badassery. With the powerful and attention grabbing success of Taken, it was no wonder that a sequel would be made. Taken 3 follows the formula of succession and checks all the little boxes of sufficiency but misses 'wow'.Let's get one thing straight: the Taken films are not revolutionary nor Academy Award level cinema – they are action films that are purely meant to entertain. I am a huge fan of the original, a little far fetched and a little weak in character development but an overall entertaining, action-packed original thriller. Missing Taken 2, I was afraid I would be a little lost with the third installment, and to those who have the same worries, there is no connection in Taken 3 that references or relates to either of its predecessors.Ex-government operative and contract specialist Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is settled in California, watching over his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) who is in college and has a live in boyfriend. Basically retired, he spends his days golfing with his op-buddies and talking to his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen). Things don't ever stay calm for Mills for very long and soon he is being chased by police and suspected of murder. Mills must evade pursuit and identify the killer and, once again, he must use his particular set of skills.To put it simply, the magic of Taken is long forgotten and lost at this point with Taken 3. It is an average action thriller that doesn't even bother to use any of the content or character development from the first two films. Nor does it invest any time whatsoever in laying a believable foundation in the beginning of the film for the action to rest. Taken 3 has no light or creativity or devotion to storytelling with most of the surprises and even the murder victim being divulged in the trailer. With that minor detail being released much of the suspense and engagement is lost with it.Everything about Taken 3 is a bit slower, a bit duller, and a bit cumbersome. Rather than create, it imitates, literally taking large chunks of dialogue from the initial film and placing it in Taken 3 in the hopes of mystifying audiences into thinking the films are of the same caliber.Please check out our website for all the reviews of the recent releases.",Taken 3

In it,we get to see how Lennie was killed and how Brian Mills and the LAPD goes into a race as to who will solve the case first. Apparently,Brian had to solve the case himself after he became the primary suspect in the case. As expected,we know that the least suspicious character in the movie is ultimately the most guilty one.The movie evidently had a lot of action scenes that were interesting and entertaining as they are either highly implausible and extremely unrealistic. In fact,there were action sequences wherein Brian has become somewhat a superhero in evading accidents and death. We also get to see how Brian is able to beat the LAPD department in solving the case and capturing the guilty criminal who is responsible for Lennie's death.As we see this movie,it was clear that the character of Brian Mills has ran its course.

121,p-jonsson,Decent enough action movie but quality has gone down since the first installment,6,15 June 2015,"I was looking forward to this movie and I have to say that I was a wee bit disappointed. It is a decent enough action movie but the script leaves somewhat to be desired. A good chunk of the movie is quite good, actually it is very good, but there are some crucial scenes that, in my opinion, really drags it down to a rather mediocre level.The plot is a fairly classical, not a very intelligent nor a very original, one. When trying to push the third sequel in a series Hollywood have a tendency to fall back on certain ""trusted"" elements. Like, make the hero haunted by the law and / or the government (no I do not consider the government to be the same as the law) or kill off some of the main (or at least likable) characters.In this movie they are doing both. I do not know why this always seems to be the standard solution because I certainly do not like it. Are the general movie going audience really falling for these, in my mind, cheap scripts? I guess they must be since this formula is repeated over and over again. Well, it is not for me to judge other peoples tastes and if I would have been a bean counter for the movie industry then it would really have been my duty to squeeze out as much money as possible regardless of whether I thought it would make a good movie or not, However, I am not. I am a consumer of movies and my personal opinion is that these plot elements are pretty cheap and not really to my liking. But then, that is just me.Anyway, the movie is not really bad. It is a decent enough action movie and, in general, I quite like the performance of Liam Neeson. He is the half-sad, silent and, most of all, ass-kicking hero that I like. He is pretty much what holds this movie together. Well, that was perhaps not entirely fair. Forrest Whitaker is doing a quite good job as well. Most of the other characters are mostly fillers. The main bad guy started off fairly good but he really never got the chance to shine and the ending scenes with the big confrontation waswell I would say pretty pathetic.This brings us to my man gripe with this movie. Up until this point Liam Neeson was really playing the big bad, and really skilled, killing machine. The way he, with the help of his friends, entered the bad guy's stronghold was perhaps not very innovative (seen that, been there , done that) but at least it was professional. After that however it turned into a bloody joke. Not only does our hero walk into a heavily defended stronghold carrying only a small pea shooter but every time he manages to liberate a decent weapon from the hopelessly incompetent bad guys he throws it away and, occasionally, picks up another pea shooter. What the f? Then we have the fairly ridiculous big fight at the end where the bad goy runs around in his underwear. That was just embarrassing. Maybe I could have swallowed the underwear thing if it was not for the fact that Lieam Neeson suddenly lost all kind of professionalism. Apart from the pea shooter syndrome mentioned before he just gets himself whacked by this maniac until, in the last minute, he miraculously recovers and gets the upper hand. There where a few minor glimpses of intelligence in the whole scene but they where never really exploited.One the whole, if would say this was a fairly decent and enjoyable action movie but I was expecting more from it. If the last third of the movie would have matched the first two thirds then my rating would have been higher. Maybe Liam Neeson is not a big enough star, although I like him a lot, to pick his roles like he wants to but I would say that he should indeed be a bit more picky and read the scripts before signing on.",Taken 3

Now, the first Taken balanced on just the right amount of shaky cam. You can see his hits, and you understand what is going on. In Taken 2 and 3, it's just crap. The cam shakes like crazy, and the cuts are way, way, way to frequent. You know.. Action directors that use shaky cam and quick cuts like that, in stead of carefully choreographed fighting, should have been taken(!) care of by Brian Mills himself.

Taken 3 goes to that unimaginable doom and comes back alive narrowly escaping from being branded the worst trilogy ever. Things that probably saved the movie can be easily counted on fingers: a twist in the plot, Liam Neeson and...okay so two fingers actually.The cameras are so dodgy that you could hardly watch those car action sequences that were supposed to be great. It is as if the director didn't want you to see the crash becauseer it's ugly? There is less violence, no gore basically (why is it rated PG 13 again?) SPOILER LINE: A promising villain, well who promised you badass in the prologue alone, and then disappears for the rest of the movie only to return again in his undies. (Awkward fight alert! :P)So there is one rad flight scene that can be passed as the most memorable in the entire flick. That and the fact that Dougray Scott gets to end this franchise. Someone offer him more roles! Also while we are at the optimistic column for a second, let us not ignore the fact that the flow of the movie was great. Everything was happening for a reason and the unfurling was actually making sense. Also, Megaton was really concerned about showing things that might have confused laymen. Nothing subtle about his direction though.Franchises like Taken eagerly wait for a script to be written (why a franchise? Moolah of course) for a possible exploit because of that sole fresh idea in the pack that got applauded in the first place for its originality. Rest is downright hunt for gold. Now that the franchise is finally over, we can say sequels of Taken are mere dispensable piggybacks that we could have probably lived without. While there are producers and directors wasting resources in order to grab more booty off a triumphant brand, on the other hand, we have great directors like Guillermo Del Toro who make sequels only to genuinely tell the people the rest of the story they conceived in their heads.

Having said that Taken 3 is a very enjoyable film with a decent plot/storyline.

Liam Neeson's renaissance as a sixty something action hero is curious, but his acting talents are undeniable and he makes for a convincing hero.The plot, and dialogue, is clunky, shallow and awkward. The camera-work confusing, with bucket shots spoiling some of the best action scenes. Some of the worst aspects of American action movies are present here. Cavalcades of police cars fail to halt their prey and crash, the bad guys miss with barrages of automatic weapon fire while Neeson scores a hit with each pistol shot, and American detectives ignore the basics of police procedure and common sense.Forest Whittaker is a fine actor, but most of the time he appears to struggles to come to terms with his preposterous role. The final shoot out in which the bad guy dies wearing a pair of white underpants will no doubt win some sort of gay award.As an action movie, there is not much wrong here, all the ingredients are present. It never drags, and you are never more than a few minutes away from a shooting. But beyond that there is a vacuous emptiness which stalks proceedings.

The cheesy story is predictable, even if you haven't seen it a dozen times before. The cameraman was probably shooting this movie while riding a wild bull and succeeded in making the fights look fake. The editing looks as if the director is epileptic or schizophrenic himself. If not, than he must be related to Michael Bay.After really enjoying the first movie, this one left me with a headache and a big question: Why the hell didn't Liam Neeson walk far away, halfway during the first sequel?

They should have stopped there. Taken3 is poor. The standard cast returns, so you have a bit of comfort with that. But gosh the plot is awful. Neeson gets framed, of course he's not guilty, so he gets his team to help him find out who the bad guy really is. And when you find out, it was like, wow, that was a shock...not. It was so beeping obvious. His daughter was nothing special, she's not that talented. Why is Forrest Whitaker so intent on chasing Neeson...doesn't he have more important things to do. If not for the few scenes of senseless violence by Neeson, there is really no reason at all to see Taken3.

132,trublu215,An improvement on the second one but still an all around disappointment,5,8 January 2015,"Liam Neeson has become a staple in the action genre, he's a big brute that could kill you with his hands. Taken 3 teeters on the edge of action melodrama and parody, so often that by the end of it, you don't know what to think of it. As a third outing is concerned, Bryan Mills is the hunted this time around after being framed for a crime he didn't commit. As the trailers articulate, you can probably tell who gets killed off. As the film progresses into a noisy and mildly enjoyable thriller, it suddenly becomes so ridiculous by the third act and also features a sequence between Mills and the baddies that could rival the campiness of Live Free or Die Hard. The only difference here is that that film was good and this is merely a mediocre outing for a character that Neeson has made into a bit of a joke now. While I love Neeson and definitely love Bryan Mills, Taken 3 is a tired exercise in what we already know he does best...kill people. Maggie Grace, Forest Whitaker and Dougray Scott fill in supporting roles and turn in performances that are mere throwaways of better past performances that these actors have done. Some scenes are very painful, including Scott's version of Stu trying to go chest to chest with Mills after a tragedy strikes their family. It is a laughable scene and is a complete contrast from what Stu was in the first film. As far as a story is concerned, if you haven't already found out, its terrible. The dialog is stiff and the actors are wooden. But this is supposed to be a brainless action film so I doubt anyone was thinking there was going to be some awesome performances. Oliver Megaton directs his action sequences as erratic and endless thus never capturing the essence of the first film where you really didn't know how it was all going to end and you didn't want the first film to end. It is an action masterpiece and this sequel is so far from the original that it really is hard to consider this a Taken film. The violence is soft, the roaring engines in the car chases are louder and the plot is dumber, that is Taken 3 in a nutshell. But as I said before, was anyone really expecting anything else?",Taken 3

135,jonathanruano,No More Taken Movies Please!!,2,2 April 2016,"I readily admit that the first two Taken movies were entertaining not because their plots were original or good, but because Liam Neeson is such a brilliant actor that he can make even a formulaic film about human trafficking seem compelling. What impressed me the most, in fact, about the first and second Taken films was something that is not even written in the script and comes from Liam Neeson alone: the ability to project unrestrained ruthlessness and aggression in pursuit of an objective.In Taken 3, Liam Neeson reprises his role again as the special ops agent Bryan Mills who can annihilate almost anyone while making himself impossible to kill. But this time the plot is so bad and the supporting past so dismally boring that even Liam Neeson's performance cannot save Taken 3 from the trash bin. My first problem with the plot is that Neeson's ex-wife Lanke (played by Dutch actress Famke Janssen) is still with Stuart, even though it was clearly apparent in the second movie that she was tired of her current husband and wanted to get back together with her first husband. So the fact that Lenore and Stuart were still together was one of the most ridiculous parts of this movie. What made the movie so much worse was when they decided to kill off Lenore right in the beginning of the film. Famke Janssen deserved so much better than that. And of course Byran Mills gets blamed for Lenore's murder because, if we did not have that overly predictable plot twist, we wouldn't have a film. Then Taken 3 went downhill from there with boring chase scenes, shoot em' ups, and blowing things up real good. There have been revenge films made well, when the film conveys how important it is for the main character to take revenge. But Taken 3 is not one of them.My other objection are the unoriginal supporting actors. The villain, for example, is a Russian mob boss borrowed from a dozen or so formula Hollywood pictures. I have seen this type of character before in Maximum Risk (1996), Eastern Promises (2007), and Icarus (2010). Given how many movies have used Russian mobsters in the past, filmmakers really need to raise their game if they are serious about competing in this genre. The makers of Taken 3, however, do not even try to compete, but instead settle for a villain who devotes all of his screen time to sounding tough even in his last moments and firing a big gun. Then we come to Stuart (Dougray St. John) who delivers a one-note performance throughout as a greedy scumbag, who has his wife killed in order to collect on the life insurance. Does this millionaire who owns a mansion really need the money that badly and does he really have to take risks like these in order to add to his massive fortune and continue spoiling his step daughter rotten? Not really, this is the lowest common denominator that we arrive at when supporting characters are painted as overgrown children rather than complicated adults. Indeed, the only actor to show any class in relation to Taken 3 is Xander Berkeley who played Stuart in the first Taken and wisely chose not to reprise the role for this film. Unfortunately, Maggie Grace decided not to follow Xander's advice because she did reprise her role as Kim, who gets impregnated by her boyfriend and kidnapped by Stuart in that order. Then we have Forrest Whitaker who plays a cop who begins to question whether Bryan Mills killed his wife. My objection to this character is that we have seen cops like these in lots of Hollywood films (Tommy Lee Jones plays such a cop in the Fugitive), and the makers of Taken 3 do absolutely nothing to make Whitaker's character more interesting than the formula character of the cop who guesses that the fugitive is not the killer. The only person out of the supporting cast who delivers a good performance is Famke Janssen, but unfortunately she gets knocked off at the beginning of this movie -- which is really irritating.Now I gave this film two out of ten, because there is one thrilling scene where Bryan Mills unbelievably uses his Porsche in order to prevent a private jet from taking off. This scene has to be seen to be believed. But aside from that implausible sequence, Taken 3 is one Taken too many.",Taken 3

I find Forest Whitaker to be VERY hard to take, with his weird wandering eye! Simply cannot get used to this; it is a major distraction to every part he plays. He is the actor chosen, unhappily, to portray Idi Amin in the movie bio. Very distracting! Liam Neeson was his usual self, though looking a bit raggy and haggard.

I would suspect that this is the final Taken film will be seeing considering the tagline It Ends Here, which I will admit is a pretty cool tagline but this film and it's predecessor Taken 2 didn't need to happen. I loved the first Taken but someone's wife was Taken and they were forced to write two pieces of garbage. In this Taken film, Bryan Mills is accused for murdering his ex-wife when her throat is sliced. As he's pursued by a savvy police inspector, Mills employs his particular set of skills to track the real killer and exact his unique brand of justice. This film was made for crash grab, that is the film's goal. Not to be entertaining, not to be heartfelt(of course), not to have pulse pounding action, just freaking cash grab. In a way depending on the box office report this film might have succeeded because there were a lot of people at my theater going to see it and I hope they didn't like it just as I don't. The film doesn't present itself with an interesting premise because the person who had Mill's ex-wife murdered is revealed easily because any smart person could have guessed who it was because even I did and I'm not that smart. The premise is very generic you know you've seen this before. Everyone acting in the film does a fine job, I don't believe that acting is a problem with these movies, it's just the fact that their lazy and unnecessary. Director Oliver Megaton( huh sounds like Megatron from Transformers) also directed Taken 2 and it shows. Some action sequences are shot horribly others just okay. The angles in the opening credits were very terrible. The pacing is very slow and it comes off as a short bland film with poor action. At least it didn't make me feel sleepy just bored. I was so bored I wanted to play a game on my Iphone. None of the elements of a good film are present during this picture it's just a sorry excuse to grab in some cash with an action film that has poor non-fast paced action,terrible camera angles, and a premise that smells of generic I'm given Taken 3 a half out of five.",Taken 3

139,CleveMan66,The only thing taken by this terrible sequel was my money and my time.,2,21 July 2015,"When is a sequel not a sequel? Maybe when a recurring character is replaced with another actor who doesn't even look like the original guy? What about when the main characters start acting and reacting differently than in the previous films? Or perhaps it's when a film abandons most of what defined the franchise and made it popular in the first place? I'm afraid all three of those things are at work in ""Taken 3"" (PG-13, 1:49). The original ""Taken"" saw retired CIA operative Brian Mills (Liam Neeson, playing an action hero for the first time) tear up Paris as he searches for his kidnapped daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). That film was original and exciting enough to spawn a sequel. In ""Taken 2"", the family and friends of the kidnappers Brian killed in the first film catch up to him and his family in Istanbul and take him and his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), captive to exact their revenge. The cool twist in that film is that Kim ends up being instrumental in saving her parents. A lot of people didn't like the second one, but I did (although not as much as the first). I'm afraid I can't be as kind to the third installment in the series, mainly because it's barely a sequel at all.""Tak3n"" (as it is written on the movie posters) opens with a Russian mobster by the name of Oleg Malankov (Sam Spruell) kidnapping and then killing an accountant when the accountant can't lay his hands on money that his boss owes to Malankov. We later find out that the accountant's boss is Stuart St. John, of the I-married-Brian-Mills'-ex-wife-and-helped-raise-Kim St. Johns. However, for this movie, the original Stuart, American light-haired actor Xander Berkeley has been replaced by dark-haired Scottish actor Dougray Scott. Apparently, this Stuart had some shady business dealings with the Russians and when their latest deal fell apart, Malankov has come for Stuart, but first kills Lenore. Brian discovers the body and immediately becomes the number one suspect. He runs from the police and spends the rest of the movie running around trying to find out exactly who killed Lenore. He gets help from his CIA buddies from the first movie and he is pursued by Inspector Franck Dotzler (Forest Whitaker), who knows how good Brian is and does pretty well at almost keeping up with him.The problem with ""Taken 3"" is that Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen (both of whom wrote all three films) seem to have forgotten what made the first film such a hit. They have abandoned the exotic locales featured in the first two films, setting this one in L.A. Except for Brian, Besson and Kamen have made most of their characters (especially Stuart) meaner, less moral or dumber than in the first two films. AND no one gets TAKEN (unless you count Lenore, who is murdered) so there's no one for Brian to rescue! Yes, he's still protecting his daughter, but the writers seem to think we need to see Kim as more vulnerable than a college student whose dad has very dangerous enemies, so he saddles her with an unnecessary side story that is only referenced very early in the movie and in a brief lame scene at the end.Now, some of you reading this review may argue that a movie should stand on its own merits. I agree – to an extent. Most people who come to see this movie are coming because they enjoyed the first film and maybe the second, but most of the appeal of those two films have been Taken out of this one. Those who aren't familiar with the franchise and come to see this movie because it looks like a good action movie are likely to be disappointed as well. The action sequences are good, but not great, and the plot, which is supposed to give those scenes meaning and import feels contrived and the villains come across more as silly cardboard cutouts than the scary monsters they're intended to be. The main reason I feel justified in judging this film based on the first two is that the movie poster features the tag line ""It Ends Here."" To me that strongly implies a continuation of Brian's battle with the obscure, but frightening gangsters from Tropojë, Albania. Instead we get the villain de jour – Russian mobsters – with no connection to the plot of the first two movies. They could have just as easily called this movie ""Non-Stop 2"" or ""Still Unknown"", or even ""From Russiawith Guns"". I was quite taken with the first film in this series and, to a lesser extent was taken too by the second. This time, the only thing taken was my money – and my time.

Now not only does he have to evade the law and prove his innocence, he also has to protect his only daughter who is under threat from the assailants.Like mentioned, this is not as dynamic as the prequels.It also does not fall on similar lines...no one is really ""taken"" in the film. The action sequences are good, especially in the climax, and there are a pretty good number of twists and turns, some of which one wouldn't expect...well, at least I did not.

142,loco_73,"Taken, Take It, Taketh...",6,10 January 2015,"Well as with all things, the sputtering and uneven ""Taken"" franchise comes to an end with its slightly better but still lacklustre third instalment.I liked the first ""Taken"" movie very much. It just felt right, looked right and was done right. Liam Neeson revived the action genre in a way, after it lagging for quite a few years. He also almost single-handedly started a new sub-genre of actioners which I would call the ""Euro-actioner""...""From Paris With Love"", ""3 Days To Kill"" and Neeson's own ""Taken"" follow-up ""Unknown"" (which I thought was a quite effective thriller). There are others but I won't bother to mention them.The first ""Taken"" movie was possessed of a very entertaining urgency and emanated a kind of crazy kinetic energy, the acting, the set-up, the action sequences and Neeson himself and his on-screen presence.In the first movie I could also root for Neeson, a father looking for his child and dealing with and disposing of anyone who got in his way or anyone who wronged his daughter. I guess parents can recognize that visceral reaction when there is any threat to their children's safety...the protective parental instinct and the lengths they would go to, to exact revenge on the people who would harm their children.In contrast ""Taken 2"" was a entirely unnecessary sequel, lazily directed, produced and filmed. Though the plot of the movie did try to make some sense, it was also full of holes and one preposterous set-up after another. I did not enjoy it at all, except perhaps for showing how beautiful of a city Istanbul is...maybe it would have worked better as a tourism promo!""Taken 3"" is a marginally better film and under the circumstances a fitting conclusion. But for all its lofty goals, the movie also seems strangely stilted and quiet. Its as if after the ""Taken 2"" experience, the team behind the franchise was somewhat timid and unsure how to proceed.Though linked to the previous two movies in the franchise, ""Taken 3"" is almost like a stand-alone movie in some ways. That is not something necessarily positive.Personally I liked Liam Neeson a lot more in the quite underrated and overlooked crime-drama, ""A Walk Among The Tombstones"", which came out in the fall of 2014. That movie was mistakenly marketed with Neeson in yet another ""high-octane action flick""...which it was not...Neeson is not the problem here. He never was. I like him, I like his acting and the dedication to all his roles. The problem lies in the fact that ""Taken"" should never, ever have been stretched for this long.In a movie industry seemingly suffering from sequelitis, and hellbent on squeezing every nickel of profit from any movie that is remotely original or substantive, it was almost inevitable that ""Taken"" would be exploited in the very same way.So ""Taken 3"" is not an awful movie, and it is a decent way to end the franchise, but it is not so much a cinematic bang...as it is a whimper!",Taken 3

Taken 3 doesn't have vast amounts of action but it was done pretty well when it needed to be, it all turned in to a cat & mouse chase which was quite enthralling even though everyone knew there would be only one outcome.Some parts were a little cheesy and there really isn't anything new, the fighting techniques, gadgets, car chases and one liners are pretty much the same but the storyline was just better than Taken 2.Overall it was a good end to the character of Bryan Mills (if it really is the end...who knows there may be a Taken 4 now he has a grandchild on the way....just joking) 7.5/10.",Taken 3

If anything the film exists only to prove that you should never be related to Neeson, on screen. Abduction, rape, murder and ignominy will be your inevitable fate, if you are. He really seems to have cornered the market in films featuring honourable but violent family men whose kin steep him in the blood of his foes.

As he tracked and pursued, Mills brings out his particular set of skill to find the true killer and clear his name. Another Taken movie... again directed by Olivier Megaton and starring Liam Neeson, Forest Whitaker, Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen. Taken was a great new thing, it was exciting to see Liam Neeson kicking asses; the second one however was terrible, it featured some of the worst filmed action I've ever seen; so no, I wasn't excited for the third one. Basically the story is very similar to The Fugitive (1993) with Harrison Ford, which is by the way a much better movie. Taken 3 was bad. It's not often that I'm writing and thinking that of a movie. In fact usually I try to avoid movies I know will be that bad or I'll be disappointed by. It's like a sixth sense, sometimes those movies are predictable. Nonetheless I love Liam Neeson, I love this man. He's awesome, like Denzel Washington, they can ad credibility to anything. Unfortunately in this movie he's set with an idiotic script and so many inconsistencies. Plus, the movie is on for about an hour when Liam Neeson finally kicks ass; and this bad ass character is so different than in the first movie. Here he's bad ass to an unrealistic degree. Beside that there's nothing better I'm afraid: this movie is directed, edited and shot so badly that I'd like to speak with Luc Besson just to make sure that he knows what is happening with the sequels of his original movie. The action is even worst than in the second movie. There are too many shots that blur by within a second that you're assaulted with a lot of images. Plus, it doesn't look convincing at all. Nothing in this movie make sense from the first scene. Taken has become The Hungover movies: first one was great and everything that followed was BAD. It went from a cool unique experience in which they kidnapped this girl and the guys were messing with the wrong family, you were truly intrigued, you needed to follow the trail and get his daughter back; to a Fugitive shitty reboot. Overall Taken 3 is a very dumb watchable movie with terrible action but an awesome likable hero. Though the poster says ""It ends here"" and I really hope so.",Taken 3

Looking at what this film was following it was safe to believe that it was going to suck, but when the first trailer came out, i was once again suddenly looking forward to this movie, it looked like a definitely not fresh concept (The Fugitive) but fresh for the franchise so i had a bit of hope that it would be good. And man was i wrong. This movie was almost a total disaster if not for one pretty decent action sequence that saved this movie from being even worse. Apart from Neeson in the same role you have seen 100 times and Maggie Grace doing the same thing as in the last two films; everyone else in this cast seemed very uninteresting and just looked like they were portraying parodies of the real characters. On top of the characters being badly written, the plot was just a very convoluted mess that only became harder to follow the more they tried to fix it with flashbacks and really dumb 'twists'. Stepping away from the plot lets get into what you really see this move for, the action. There were a few action sequences over the course of this movie and the good news is that there was one good action sequence, the bad news was that pretty much every other one sucked. For example there is an action sequence that takes place on a Highway involving high speeds, cars, trucks and all that stuff you have seen before. Only this time it features unbelievable car movements and comical crashes and stunts that already make it hard to follow then it is also accompanied by around 500 different shots that all last for under a second making it impossible to know what was happening. When that scene ended i stared at the screen and just said ""WTF just happened"" because i had absolutely no idea what i had seen. There are also many sections where you see what is happening and you just think that; OK, that person is dead but in the next scene they're not and you're given no explanation you just have to accept what happened and move on which was really unbelievable and stupid to do. There was a decent heist like action sequence that was poorly set up but was the highlight of the movie amongst all the other crap. If i could sum up this movie it would be just a giant turd that did not need to be made featuring crap you have seen before only done much, much worse. But the movie sums itself up pretty well in the first 5 minutes when there is a 2 minute conversation about being predictable, very predictable and if that is a form of foreshadowing then i guess they got two things right. - 3.5",Taken 3
147,krycek19,Surprisingly good.,7,23 April 2016,"And I really hate the sequel. So let me explain why I'm giving the final chapter 7 stars.The first Taken was genius. It was violent and gritty and exciting and didn't feel like a PG13 movie.Then came the obvious money-grabbing sequel, which was terrible. Ridiculous plot and shaky cam witch ruined the action-scenes.I was never gonna see this as it is the same guy that directed the sequel. But then I found a site I could stream it from and I figured what the hell.And I was really surprised. Sure it has flaws in the plot and the acting is terrible from the otherwise hot and usually great Maggie Grace. But it's a great action-movie. The shaky cam is almost gone and the action scenes are really well done. And the plot of who killed Lenore was interesting enough to make me watch the movie to the end without ever being bored.Forest Whitaker is miscast and plays once again the dumb cop-leader who is always one step behind the hero. Basically he plays the exact same character as he did in The Last Stand. Here he is just even more stupid.Giving Bryans buddies from their bodyguard company something to do for a change is nice.The cinematography is nice as well as the musical score. It seems like the director really wanted to make up for the horrible second movie. And bring back some of the stuff that worked so well in the original, And he did.For a PG13 movie this feels like an R-rated movie. It has plenty of bloodshed and the f-word is said many times. Nice to see that in a PG13 movie that usually don't allow blood or the f-word. But it gives the movie more edge. And bloodshed when people are shot is just more satisfying to look at.And the fact that this takes place only in the US and not in Europe is a nice change as well.I can definitely recommend this movie.",Taken 3

Was hoping this one would be as good as it's predecessors. But alas! I didn't enjoy it that much.1: The car chase scene was too confusing and therefore frustrating. It takes real skill to do a good car chase scene involving multiple vehicles and events that a viewer can sensibly follow.2: The reason for said car chase was ""lame"" and therefore not justified. Bryan Mills had already demonstrated his ability to easily disarm the average Joe or ""Joe Cop"" earlier in this movie and previous ones. Nonetheless, he allowed himself to be cuffed and led outside to a patrol car thru a dim hallway by one cop. At this point I was on the edge of my seat thinking he was going to do something. No way he was going to allow himself to be ""taken"" (ha, ha,) into custody. But he went like a lamb with the officer to his car. The car chase scene with him in the back of the police car caused a lot of damage on the highway and innocents must have gotten hurt (Ah, if only he had done one of his quick hand-to-hand combat techniques BEFORE he was cuffed, or even AFTER, while he was being escorted by Joe Cop). But the producers and writer wanted a spectacular car chase and this was the best excuse they could come up with: Bryan Mills MUST forget he's intelligent and would not risk innocents on the road when he could easily put Joe Cop to bed and thus avoid that confusing mess on the highway.3: Speaking of quick hand-to-hand combat techniques: I have no idea what's being done in those close-up fight scenes. Really. Too many quick cuts (editor on speed?) to figure out if Bryan Mills and his opponents really know what the hell they're doing. Ergo and to wit: if this movie had a good car-chase and fight-scene coordinator we, the viewers, would have been better able to sensibly follow what was happening and enjoy the experience.

150,georgewilliamnoble,Well Made Very Solid Sequel That Delivers!,7,22 October 2018,"OK, let's get the negatives away straight off, if you have seen the original and the sequel that was kind of a remake, you know what to expect. The movie producers need to keep to the basic ""Taken"" framework and tag on a plot that has new elements while retaining the core of the series. Sequels are really mostly just for fans anyway, and Liam Neeson does action as well as anyone since Clint Eastwood years ago, so this movie appeals to fans Of the ""Taken"" franchise and to those who follow Neeson's action career. So to judge films like ""Taken 3"" on any level other than as a entertaining action shoot em up is pointless and just silly. On the level of a action sequel this film delivers the goods it is none stop from the start with all the high end goodies of thrilling car chases, last gasp escapes, riveting shoot-em' up's all wrapped up in a glossy stylised soup, that while providing nothing new, is still very entertaining for action film fan's. Pretension and all the pseudo intellectual pretense we leave to the Oscar voters, film fan's often just want a empty shallow piece of entertainment and escapism that delivers the good's. ""Taken 3"" succeeds very well in its goals, call it a guilty pleasure but i enjoyed this second ( Cinema First) viewing very much.

151,michaelhirakida,More Liken Taken *Insert Urine Joke Here* You get the point.,5,30 January 2015,"I was really not a fan of the first Taken Movie. Mainly because Liam Neeson is way too old to be in action films. People say oh Arnold and Sylvester Stallone should just retire, LIAM needs to retire. So I didn't watch Taken 2 because I thought it would be bad but I did watch Taken 3. So here are my thoughts.Bryan Mills is back yet again and if you're wondering why they needed to make another film, its because they needed to end it. So someone killed his ex wife. He doesn't know his daughter is pregnant and he is on the run from Policeman Forest Whitaker. The first problem I really do have with the film is that in Action Scenes, The camera moves way to fast. In the first action scene where Bryan is chased by cops after he finds his wife dead. The camera cuts every 1 second literally which gives us no time to figure out what is going on. The story is predictable because you know every move Bryan is going to make. Like seriously, If you have seen all The Taken Movies you know what is going to happen.I am also beginning to think that the Liam Neeson Phone Call is becoming a new cliché in movies. OK if you combine the movies together, there is like 15 of these phone calls! By god these scenes are boring and gives an inept impact on me.The pregnant plot line. OK. So you think Bryan is going to react to Kim's Pregnancy right? NO. He doesn't. He just doesn't when she tells her. All he says is his blood sugar is low because he hasn't eaten from being chased for so long. This could have been an effective scene if he reacted in some way. BUT NO. We don't have anything. Great.So it looks like I'm really criticizing this movie A LOT. But did I like ANYTHING? Um... Maybe a few things. I do like actress who played Kim. She was cool. Some action scenes are good in some respects... when they're not trying to cause extreme nausea.So that is it. It's over and I don't care. The movie is really poorly made and hopefully this series is actually over. It's not good and it's by Hack Luc Besson who wrote and produced. Sorry If this review was useless but I really didn't care for the movie.53/100 C",Taken 3
152,rprince-832-6294,I think it is worse than Taken 2.,5,16 January 2015,"-Taken 3 (2015) movie review: -Liam Neeson is back as action star Bryan Mills, but this time he must go on the run and try to clear his name after being framed for the murder of his wife! (Not a spoiler, it's in the trailer.) -This complete rip-off of The Fugitive is really further evidence that Taken should have just remained one film, not three, as the director of panned action films like Columbiana, Transporter 3, and Taken 2 pulls out every poorly done cliché in the B-grade action movie handbook. I am going to rip on this movie more than it deserves, but I enjoyed last year's Transformers: Age of Extinction more. Soooo yeah.-The story is EXACTLY like The Fugitive. And The Fugitive is the best of its genre, so it is a hard act to follow up. But it is incredibly predictable and takes sooo many unnecessary turns just for the sake of a car chase. It also has a very Lifetime movie subplot which consumes the first 20 minutes of film. And an opening scene that sets up another plot that was left angina until near the end. AND the ending was stupid.-The pace is pretty slow. Probably because the entire film is either Liam Neeson in over-the-top, poorly edited action scenes, Maggie Grace doing boring things, or Forest Whitaker sitting and thinking.-The acting is not bad, better than the second, but nowhere near as good as the first Taken. Also every extra in this is pretty bad. I also noticed that Stewart jumped shipped. Stewart. I don't even know who played him and there was a different actor in this.-The characters. So Bryan Mills is like usual, except not as much of a boss. Or as much of a killer. And Forest Whitaker as the detective after him is like the most cliché detective ever. He even has a chess piece he constantly looks at.-The music is way too dramatic in some scenes. He literally opens a door and the music is appropriate to a car chase. Also mixing lyrics in a score for drama is something I do not like. Lifetime does that.-The action is a mess. Probably because the editing sucks. But there are so many cuts in the action scenes, once you can finally tell what is going on, you realize that either tons of innocent people were killed in an unnecessary, over-the-top car chase, or something happens where there was 0% chance of even Liam Neeson surviving, only to cut to him alive, unhurt, and somewhere completely random.-I will say there were a few scenes I was at least interested in and satisfied with. Like two.-Taken 3 holds a PG-13 rating form some action, but not violence. Because this film was afraid of things like blood. Or writers. It has a PG-13 amount of language also.-If you are looking to watch The Fugitive with worse writing, bad editing, and over-the-top predictable scenes only to keep track of how many times Liam Neeson would have died, Taken 3 will be right up your ally! Just kidding. It is not good. I think it is worse than Taken 2 actually. It is not like Sci-fi original quality bad, but Taken 3 is not worth seeing. Ever. I would give it something like a low 5/10.",Taken 3

There could have been a lot more action scenes and the way Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) seemed to appear out of deadly situations did seem a little far fetched. The idea of the story was good but the film could have been done a little better. One great thing about this film was seeing Liam Neeson and Forest Whitaker in the same film, two of my favorite actors. Forest Whitaker played the part of Frank Dotzler perfectly. These two characters in this film were a perfect match, both highly intelligent and one always knew what the other was doing or going to do. I'm seeing a lot of mixed reviews with this film so you would have to be the judge.

Mr. Megaton, as has been noted here elsewhere, should not be directing movies. This was a cash-grab, I mean, nobody was even taken. How can you call the movie ""Taken 3"" when nobody was taken?

157,rjsf96,Taken' the P*ss,2,9 January 2015,"Oh my, 'Taken' how you have fallen from grace since 2008. With each sequel the pain seems to get much, much worse. I'm not going to be forgiving, the truth is that I absolutely hated this movie and nothing is going to change that.So first things first, the positive, err, and I'm really grasping thin air now. The photography of the United States was decent, when the film doesn't go into action overkill and becomes lurching from side to side as if in the hands of an ADD 5 year old film maker. So yes, this film has one positive, sort of, well not really.Moving swiftly forward then, for this is a painful movie going experience and one that I wish I will never be exposed to again. This time around no one actually gets taken (pretty misleading title then). But his ex-wife is killed and Bryan Mills is framed for it. Now, he is a fugitive on the run, he will find the people responsible and he will kill them. Right, correct me if I'm wrong but, Taken or at least the original was all about hard hitting, bone crunching action. It wasn't the greatest action movie ever made, however it was a damn fun thrill ride. This sequel is anything but fun, it is an endurance test of how much rubbish you can take from one movie. The action is god awful and is enough to make anyone hurl, yet I think I know the ones responsible for this fatal flaw.Studios nowadays see teenagers as the sole income for money; a '12' rating allows them to make the maximum profit. There is no doubt that this film will make a killing at the box office. What it doesn't kill is time; it drags and drags threatening to stop the hand on your watch. Worst of all, the action is cut so tight and so close that it allows for little to no movement for the characters to breathe, I can't even see their whole body! It's the most frustrating thing, a film franchise that is scared of its own fondness for gore.Another thing that must be pointed out is that fact that Mills has become Superman between Taken 2 and 3. This time he survives being in a car whilst it plummets tens of stories down into an elevator shaft, an explosion ensues, we don't see Mills leave, yet in the next scene he is all alive and well so we figure he must have made it! The one credible thing this took away was his vulnerability and ability to spill blood. Take that away and I don't care about his fate, why should I? Frankly, I could go on and on about how the script is tailored for an 8 year old, how the lines are groan worthy and how everyone inexplicably gives Mills time to recover and plan his next move. Maybe they once went out for a beer together? So my question to the Director is what next? What project do you wish to pursue and torture us with? It will make millions either way.

158,InaneSwine,Below average Hollywood action fodder,4,18 February 2016,"Following the thrilling first installment, and totally forgettable second installment, comes this slightly less forgettable third film of a franchise that really didn't have much right becoming a franchise in the first place.The action sequences are typically exciting, equipped with well choreographed fight sequences, repetitive as they become. However, I was disappointed with the quality of the image on many occasions, particularly the opening credits. For an IMAX film, it really didn't look or feel like one. And in one particular chase sequence on the road, the visual effects suffer significantly.But the acting, script and story is really where the film falls flat. Neeson, Scott and Grace turn in poor performances; and while it's always a pleasure to see Whitaker on screen, his character, along with all the others, is as generic as they come.It is better than the second film, but that's not a difficult challenge. A weak setup, an unconvincing cast and an abrupt ending make Taken 3 below average Hollywood action fodder.I suppose I just wasn't particularly taken with it.",Taken 3
159,vistheindian,Exactly what you expected,5,19 January 2015,"Quickie Review:Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is wrongfully framed for the murder of his ex-wife (Famke Janssen). Now he must put skills into action to find the true killer, while avoiding the authorities pursuing him. Liam Neeson solidified himself as an action hero in this franchise. Many people, including myself will watch this film just for the love of Neeson. But does that make this a good movie? Nope not at all. It's unintentionally laughable, and depending on your mood that might actually help it.Full Review:Liam Neeson, is the only reason I went to see this movie. The first Taken surprised me and I loved it for its contained small scale action. Then for Taken 2 they decided to amp the action in all the wrong ways. That added to my hesitation for Taken 3 (or Tak3n), and it turns out this movie is Taken 2 on steroids.I'll admit, I still love Liam Neeson in this film. His voice and presence demands your full attention. He makes even the most mundane of scenes interesting to watch, at least when he talks. There is Forest Whitaker as a new addition to the cast. He was good in his role, albeit somewhat small. Speaking of small roles Famke Janssen and Maggie Grace are not as involved in this film as the last Taken. That's a good thing because their characters are the least interesting, and they just take us away from Neeson badassery time.All that was wrong with Taken 2 has been amplified here. This film committed one of the worst sins of action movies, shaky cam. It's as if the whole movie was shot by someone having seizures. Get that camera man a medic! The editing of the action scenes were also painful for the eyes. For example there is a chase scene which is shown as a series of shots that each (without exaggeration) were no longer than 2 seconds long. So the scene would literally cut 90 times for a 3min chase. I loved Taken 1 because overall it felt believable that someone could be so methodical and do the things Liam Neeson's character does. However, in this movie you never see the resourcefulness (the particular set of skills) of the character and instead depends on absurdly sized explosions to deliver the excitement. I can suspend my disbelief for action, but it got so ridiculous that my friends and I were audibly laughing in the cinema.So if you like Taken 2, no problem, you will love Tak3n. Otherwise, you will have similar feelings to mine. I would recommend watching it at home with your friends to have a good laugh. To be clear though, you will be laughing at it and not with it. Definitely, it's not worth spending money on a ticket. I fear this franchise has become a parody of itself, and if they make another one with the title T4ken or Taken 4ever, I AM OUT!Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Taken 3
160,CowherPowerForever,Bagels,7,14 January 2015,"Nearly seven years after the first film became a surprise hit, we are onto the second Taken sequel. While the story lines might be getting thinner, the fun and excitement is still there, for the most part. The film is certainly not the best of the series, but in my opinion it is a step up from Taken 2. The Following is my review of Taken 3.Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen are both back for this sequel. Both of these writers also wrote the first and second films of this series. While no one is actually Taken in this film, all the characters we are use to seeing are back. This time around Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson) is accused of murdering his ex-wife, and of course he will not stop until he finds out who set him up. The story is actually pretty good and with some fabulous acting the down time early in the film moves by nicely. The film also features some nice plot twists that add an element that usually is not in these Taken films. While I must admit the ideas are getting old, the execution here is overall very good. Besson and Kaem do another good job of writing a Taken film.The film was directed by Olivier Megaton, who also directed Taken 2. His shooting style of somewhat shaky camera nature is off putting though. The bigger action scenes with the car chases just don't look that well in motion, and this time around it seems they used some extra CG to scale down the budget. This makes for less beautiful action sequences. The hand to hand combat action scenes though are shot amazingly and are a big highlight of the film. As I mentioned above the film is slow in spots, but that slowdown is at the beginning of the film as they are building up the story. With fantastic actors like Liam Neeson, Forest Whitaker, Jon Gries, David Warshofsky, Leland Orser, and many others, the acting aspects of the film really hold the film together. Overall, Megaton does a good job on this film, but the bigger action sequences just don't look as well as they have in the past.The film was composed by Nathaniel Mechaly who has scored all of the Taken films. His work in this film is actually very good. A nice step up from the score in the previous Taken film. When the action hits so does this score. It really draws you into the film in ways films in this general generally don't. The depth on this score by Mechaly is great and really a fun score all around.In closing, this Taken film was billed as the final film of the franchise, but I highly doubt this series will end now. As long as there is money to be made, and as long as Liam Neeson wants to keep making them, they will likely keep milking this series. The film is not bad, and while it is not the best of the series and the ideas are getting worse, this film in my opinion is better than Taken 2. Fans of the series, like myself, will ignore the critics trashing this film and go see it anyway. Frankly, this is the best idea. The major critics always love trashing films like this, so their opinions are useless. The film is a good fun adventure and is well worth the price of admission.7.4/10",Taken 3

That gruff, angry manner. But it's pretty clear now in Taken 3 that Neeson (in his early '60s) isn't really a great ACTION-hero anymore. The fight scenes are all done in great close up with lots of cuts...trying to hide the fact that Neeson can't move like he needs to. When his character is running from the police early in the film...we see 1 second of him running, then cut, then a shot of him from the waist up, then a longer shot of running but from behind, where a stuntman can do it for him. I have no issues with Neeson...he's been such a reliable actor for so many years. But in this film, he seems tired, and the film does a bit too.At least no one gets Taken...not really. The film is set in Los Angeles...so we've gone from the first film, set all over Europe, to the 2nd, set primarily in Istanbul to now...set in Neeson's back yard. Neeson's character, Bryan Mills, is framed for murder, so of course he must escape the cops and solve the crime himself. The body count continues to be high...but it's a PG-13 film, so there's nothing too graphic. It all seems clean and almost anti-septic. These are action films for folks who like ""Matlock.""Maggie Grace is back again...still acting like a high school girl (although I guess she's in college now), even though the actress is north of 30. She just isn't pulling it off. Her character is quite annoying...seemingly incapable of making ordinary life decisions. Her dad tells her it might be too hard for her to own a puppy, for goodness sake. That's how little confidence he has in her!! Famke Janssen returns as Mills' ex-wife, but her character continues to be underwritten. It's clear she's made a mistake divorcing Mills. That's the only thing her character ever seems to do...make us realize these two really belong together.Early on, the plot actually takes a surprising turn (shocker!)...but for the most part, this is pretty cookie cutter. Again, bullets never hit Neeson, and he seldom misses. You just never really feel like he's in peril. The film generates the least tension of the 3. Although there's nothing incompetent about it, really...it's just not particularly good in any given area either. I give it three stars because it is diverting...but that's the best you can say. If you're looking for an action film...I suggest you keep looking. Any DIE HARD film (except the last one) is better.",Taken 3

Hope they stick with that and don't come with more of this utter nonsense. While Taken 2 was no great film but at least it had some enjoyable action. This one unfortunately fails even in that department. The action is way to choppy with too many cuts which almost induces headache. The editing and direction is horrendous. None of the action felt like having any continuity and it's way too hard to figure what on earth is happening? The story is no good either. Firstly no one gets Taken here but that's okay as they try something different. But the problem is how badly they execute the different approach. The plot line surrounding Stuart is completely absurd. Also it spends way too much time in first half with the relationship between the characters in the first half when we already know them very well. The almost 2 hours run time feels much longer and couldn't wait for it to end. Even Liam Neeson looked so uninterested that his presence didn't have the charm of the first 2 films. The cheesy dialogues from boring one-dimensional characters, disastrous action sequences and a below-par act by Neeson makes Taken 3 a complete disaster.

In Taken 3 they have taken the brutal, raw and fast paced beauty of the Taken concept and murdered it with shallow characters, pitiful action and plots that take us back to B grade Hollywood action movies (I mean how many times do the directors pitifully try to raise tension with film edits that show seemingly inescapable crashes only for the next scene Liam continuing on as if nothing happened. He just went from the cool old man of the Taken series to something laughable. He will probably star in Expendables 4 next. The Good - Hmmmmmmm perhaps the goodies you ate watching this B- movie.The Bad - The list could go on but here is a snapshot The camera is way too jerky, we get the director is trying to convey action but this movie takes it too another level - Bring a vomit bag. I know Liam's character is meant to be portrayed as super tough but how he recovers from one scene to the next is just ridiculous - Falling down a lift shaft in a car which explodes only for the next scene to have him looking like he went for a gentle jog. Liam's character has lost his fighting spirit - hand to hand sequences were too quick and lacked the raw and brutal character of the other films. This is I presume due to the fact that Liam probably should be in an old persons home now.

168,moviescoundrel,Don't Take from this Guy,7,11 January 2015,"I liked the first ""Taken"" a lot. I liked the second one less. For some reason, this one looked intriguing and fresh enough to where I thought it would be a most welcome finish. It basically felt like a poor man's ""Fugitive"" only Mills is quite a bit more resourceful and dangerous than Harrison Ford's Richard Kimble could ever imagine. The film works for the most part. Although I did think it started a bit slow and I thought the film only had a 90 minute run time and it was taking way too long to get into the action. At a run time of almost two hours, the drama is not so bad and the set up works fine. It is difficult to predict exactly how things will turn out other than you know Mills isn't going down without a fight and you know he will take many down with him in the process. The formula works for the most part here although there were a few scenes in which Mill's nobility is a bit questionable. At one point he takes a police officer at gunpoint in a car and forces him to drive across the median into traffic endangering many other's lives in a high speed chase all at the expense of finding his wife's killer sooner rather than later. It just felt off. There are some twists and turns that are interesting and kept it fresh enough to not be too mediocre.

And no, I'm not patting myself on the back, but warm bagels did enter my mind as something in his favor. And frankly, just talking with the bagel clerk would have been less 'brilliant' and more realistic. He had just been there about 10 minutes prior!

There is no way in hell at least one person would not have been killed in that massive highway crash. And he just walks away like all is forgiven.

Plenty of action, but I just didn't care.",Taken 3

171,sujanfaster,The end that does not justify the means,7,9 January 2015,"Hollywood has been bitten by the sequel/prequel bug. Its the new money-minting trend in Hollywood. But audiences like me don't care as long as we see our favorite stars kicking some ass. I am a big fan of Liam Neeson and it goes without saying that I have loved him since I have seen Taken. So yes, I would love more and more movies like that even though they are brainless. Taken 2 was alright for me, though it did not live up to the first one (how many of them live up to the originals anyway). This time, the makers have decided to end it with a third one.They make it clear on the poster, ""It ends here"". It does end, but its just not a 'Taken' film. It is just another action movie.This movie is about Bryan Mills (Neeson) taking on the people who kill his wife as the police chase him. I personally expected a thread from old movies that connects to the events happening in this movie. But apart from emotional ones, there are none. Of course the second movie had its on villain-revenge saga which was a result of first one. So a same theme would have made this predictable. But then again its Taken franchise and its Liam Neeson. So, the audience would have cared less. But this time Taken 3 turns out to be just another action movie which did not have to be a part of Taken legacy. There are some well shot action sequences as usual. But the intensity and the suspense part is not up to the mark.Liam Neeson at his age still shows he is the boss when it comes to this kind of action movies. However that's what he has been doing in the recent years. Maggie Grace continues her panicked face daughter role. Forest Whitaker could have had a better scope than just eating bagels. Dougray Scott and Sam Spruell are in their usual type cast roles. The star cast could have been strengthened to give this trilogy a grand ending.I am rating the movie high because I love Liam Neeson. But this could have been better, the director and writer could have taken their time and ended it in style.",Taken 3
172,alexcomputerkid,Taken 3 has a script that takes the characters' motives in a way that feels like it's trying to reclaim old success,3,9 February 2015,"If there's anybody in Hollywood with a most interesting career, it has to be Liam Neeson. With a first role in Excalibur, then a breakout role in Schindler's List and roles in the massive popular Star Wars: Episode I : Phantom of the Menace and Batman Begins, it's safe to say to he has dabbled in many genres in his film career. In 2008 he starred in Taken, a French thriller about a guy going to save his daughter in France after being kidnapped and really that's where Neeson really took off. With roles in Unknown in 2011, The Grey in 2012 and Non-Stop along A Walk Among the Tombstones both in 2014, Neeson has found his niche as 60 year old action character who's willing to kick some ass. It's unusual for an actor to have a peak like this so late in his career but he's one that did. Neeson is back to this type of role in the newest installment in the Taken series.Following the events of the first two movies, Bryan Mills (Neeson) is now living a normal life in Los Angeles until his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) is killed and Bryan is framed for the murder. A typical plot that really is not very good. We expected Neeson to be the action guy that he is in these films but it is as if this script took him too far into this character. He gets framed for the murder of his ex-wife but instead he goes on a long journey to catch the killers where it would be so much easier to testify to the police because all of the evidence points to him being not at all involved in this murder. So once Liam gets to fight these guys, we have a high budget movie with very unrealistic action set in a very typical L.A. and further the action sadly only picks up well in its last act.Director Olivier Megaton also proves that he doesn't know what to do with supporting characters along the way. Maggie Grace who plays Mills' daughter is left to wander through most acts and is also a character that we learn is pregnant which serves no purpose to the main plot. Taken 3 has a script that takes the characters' motives in a way that feels like it's trying to reclaim old success. Even Forrest Whitaker shows up playing a typical cop role for him with a lot unintentional humor and the character literally that makes you want to have some bagels right after you leave the theater. I am not surprised at all that Taken 3 falls into a January release nor am I surprised how much money it made because of it's cast and due to the popularity of the other films. We really don't need another Taken film but with this series making some good money, I won't be surprised to see more down the road. The Taken series is a clumsy and broad action series that by now has run it's course.",Taken 3
173,johnplocar,This is when fun critiquing feels like work...,2,9 January 2016,"""Taken 3"": I miss when Luc Besson films were great. I like Luc Besson's writing whether we are talking about the first ""Taken"" movie or ""Leon: The Professional"", ""District B13"", ""The Fifth Element"" or ""The Transporter"" movies. For some reason though his writing has not worked very well these ""Taken"" sequels, at least in my opinion. Although, I don't know if it's entirely his fault since he's not the only credited writer on these films. But there are some very heavy ""Luc Besson"" moments like when in ""Taken 2"" having the daughter throw hand grenades off a rooftop. Although in this film there isn't a whole lot that struck me as Besson's work. This was honestly a pretty terrible sit. I was really hoping that maybe after the second film they would have learned a lesson or two and delivered something fun as the first film, but no. Not even f**king close. I didn't even hate the second film, but good god I kinda hate this thing. This has nothing redeemable about it. I could not even say that Liam Neeson wanted to be in here, hell, he barely even says a word most of the time. Just grunts and occasionally gives a forced smile. The action sequences are so poorly done with the terrible camera work, I could not tell what was going on or who was in correlation to what in a scene with the ridiculous ""shaky cam"" going on most of the time. That aside though, there is no intensity to these fights anyways because I'm just waiting for Neeson to just win, which is not fun. It's boring. The movie tries ""tricking"" the audience that maybe this time he won't make it or he might not get out of a situation, but of course he does every single time. To the point where sometimes they don't even show how he actually does. Like in one scene he's in a car that falls down an elevator shaft and immediately explodes, then cuts to him just randomly buildings away without a scratch on him. Or again about 20 minutes later he's in another car that ends up rolling down a cliff and exploding (Good god, they just don't make cars like they used to) but he gets out completely fine. Which even when it, for some reason, goes back to ""explain"" how he got out, it doesn't show how he got out. He's just all of the sudden out. I guess this was Neeson's audition to being Batman. I could not give a crap about anyone in this thing. It was about 15 minutes of exposition at the beginning and then nothing. Seriously it feels like nothing happened in this movie. I mean, I think that it takes Neeson 30 minutes before he even tries to find out who killed his wife. Which by the way, I guess that a little bit of blood on someone's neck means that their throat was slit. The editing was awful, it felt like for the first act of the movie it kept cutting from one scene to the next as fast as possible so it just could get to the action, then for the rest of the movie once it got to the action it was constantly cutting to the same exact thing happening over and over. Oh and of course, it's a ""Taken"" movie, so you have to include evil Russian/European guys for Nesson to kill; how could anyone forget them? Which they were honestly pretty irrelevant to what was really going on other than to give Neeson bad guys to fight, when he's not just straight up murdering police officers and innocent bystanders, and give the story a convoluted plot that was completely unnecessary. The only person that Neeson didn't kill was the person that he set out to kill in the first place and actually deserved it. Spoiler Alert? F**k the Spoiler Alert, if you're still excited to see this then you've got your own issues.",Taken 3

He needs to find out who killed Lenore and also his priority now is to protect Kim, (Maggie Grace) his daughter, as she may be the next victim. Seems the Bryan Mills family cannot catch a break. We saw Kim taken in Taken 1; then we saw Bryan and Lenore taken in Taken 2. Who was taken in Taken 3? I cannot tell you but you will not be disappointed. The Taken series is still good. We expect to see Bryan use his ""skills"" to evade the police and we are not disappointed. Hey, this is what we came to see. We also see a very good car chase to include a shipping container fly thru the air. How good is that? (was that CGI or a real stunt? Hmmmmm) And we see Bryan going over the cliff in a sports car, ouch,ouch, ouch! And, of course, the fight scenes are getting more real (read brutal). There should be a statement in the beginning of these movies to say: No actor was hurt in the filming of this movie. Yes, ouch, ouch, ouch again and again and Hey, they do it for animals. Most of these action movies always have a twist and this one is no different. No, I cannot tell you that either, but it may surprise you. Okay, maybe not. All in all very good entertainment watching Bryan use his ""skills"" to uncover who murdered Lenore and to protect Kim. Notable: Forest Whitaker as the police lieutenant, who did okay, but seemed a little lost in here.This is the end of the Taken series. It's a pity Bryan and Lenore didn't have more children. Ha!

176,sickofenjoyingmyself,Comfortingly predictable action,6,8 May 2016,"As I have stated above - Taken 3 is comfortingly predictable if you liked the first two movies. There is almost constant action throughout the movie which keeps a high tempo and makes it enjoyable. It does become extremely far fetched and you do find yourself asking at some point why anyone would want to mess with a man who has such a dangerous skill set and a history of using it. I think Forest Whitaker and Dougray Scott were both enjoyable to watch and gave the movie a bit more credibility than it might have had. The story line is pretty unconvincing and tends to messily jump about from place to place without satisfactory resolution. All in all, if you like the Taken franchise or action movies you will enjoy this. You take it for what it is and don't look for anything deeper. Having said that, I think this franchise has gone as far as it can go. It is getting tired and would indeed be best if it 'ends here'.",Taken 3

It's always great to see Liam Neeson back in action, but this slightly skewed towards family violence drama than the action sequences of race against time in the first episode seems to be less exciting. It has some memorable score (A Stutter feat. Arnor Dan by Ólafur Arnalds), it still presents the same kind of lifeless actions with some unintentionally hilarious moments which shall manage to attract the attention of the crowd, otherwise it just changes the previous mediocre Taken 2 into Taken which the taken target this time is actually the audiences rather than the characters themselves.",Taken 3
178,MajorBaleegh,Most Lame Movie,1,14 February 2015,"What a shameless plot was formulated, a woman who got divorced from the previous husband who is shown as very much in love, why they got divorced in the first place, then after marrying another person still involved with the ex-husband is totally out of proportion or the same might be a practice in America and once the lady was murdered both the ex-husband and the daughter claims that the ex was very much in love with the victim and the second husband is being shown as a negative character. If the ex was so much in love why he divorced the lady is totally not understood. The accused was chased by six police officers with cop cars and a surveillance helicopter and still he manages to escape at the age of 62 shows the negligence and incompetence of the police. Furthermore the accused manages to enter the morgue unnoticed shows how much loose security is there in the United States especially after 9/11. The movie shows anybody can enter the city morgue without seeking any permission especially once you are a murder suspect, that's funny?A tall man around six feet tall hides himself in the trunk of the car and all the police force can't see him that's strange, are the cops blind or they were blindfolded I failed to understand? Can you download the GPS data of an Audi without even starting the car, is it possible I don't think so; at least make some sense please. Can anybody get the LAPD police card as shown in the movie, as murder suspect manages to have a police card to check the whereabouts of his murdered ex-wife, what's going on people? LAPD police is such a joke an ex-military convict is playing them like kids, its 2014, they should wake up now! The police cars have a metal cage in the back seat to avoid any mishap from the convicts which was not present in these cars where the convict was sitting once he was caught. Three cops were firing on the car four bullets entered the front windshield but still none hit the convict, the bullets entered the front windshield and went back is it possible, LAPD pull up your socks there was huge blast the entire police trooper was burnt to ashes still the dear convict moved out safe and sound, this was very lame I must say that. Such a innocent police being played in the hands of a convict, very funny how did the convict went out of the ladies room once it has one gate where the police man was standing, how he managed to bypass him, was the cop blind very funny. I kept on laughing for a long time after that scene. Is this a movie or a joke, the accused car went all the way down to the cliff, but he still manages to come back to the road unhurt, I think this was the Liam Neeson's worst movie ever, so much goofs and so much fake that it was really not worth it, still the movie gives a 260 million dollar plus business what has gone wrong with the American's what funny stuff they want to see I am amazed. At 65 minutes in the movie, it time for the Russians to be beaten up like those silly idiot LAPD officers, one old man manages to disable four young gangsters, very jolly movie, I must say that. The fight scenes clearly show that the convict is tired but still he overcomes all in the movie. The convict is neutralizing cops as they are bunch of kids is LAPD is so weak and untrained bunch of goons I am astonished. These Russian are pure idiots always loose from American's but still don't learn the lesson. One man went and killed the complete Russian gang well done Mr. Convict you won Medal of Honor. A person who divorced her wife in real life don't want to see her face and in this movie he divorcée has killed over thirty people to take the revenge of his murdered ex-wife very unrealistic. The most worthless movie ever watched, where did the husband went throughout the movie, he was shown in the beginning and in the end, the entire time his wife was in danger he was away and when everything cooled down he is back again; what a pathetic man was the husband of the daughter. I gave this movie 1 out of ten, the Hollywood lacks young actors now all old timers are acting heroes and young one are vaporized in thin air.

There were a few plus sides, seeing more of his associates take a role - but there were also a lot of plot holes.He needn't have run, as the bagels would have given him an alibi at the start (something Forest Whitakers character comments on at the end). The receipt would have shown he was buying bagels when the 'unlisted' call came through.Then he can run from the Police, beat the Police up, throw them from cars and threaten them with guns..................that's without the carnage across the city as he seeks revenge.But he walks away with no consequences, go figure.I've given it a 7 as I enjoyed it.

181,thomas-w15,Even Liam Neeson could not save this one....,2,21 January 2015,"Taken 3: Liam Neeson is the king of action movies. He is the ultimate badass. Every action movie I have seen with Liam Neeson, I have enjoyed. Every single film... except Taken 3. Liam Neeson tried but ultimately the movie was terrible. The film suffers from a near non- existent plot that thinks a lot of car chases and explosions is enough to make this movie passable- it was not. Not often in an action movie do I find myself getting bored, but it happened here. During one of the unmemorable scenes of the car chase, I found myself wondering what Liam Neeson's character Bryan Mills is trying to accomplish here. The answers was nothing. I thought long and hard about it throughout the film and came to the conclusion there was no actual point to the chase. It added nothing to the plot and Bryan Mills could have easily gotten rid of the cops before they even hand-cuffed him because of his ""very special set of skills"" which he exhibited numerous times throughout the film. Hollywood should know that, although Liam Neeson is awesome in every way, he is not a substitute for a well- throughout plot. The script was even worse. The dialogue throughout the movie was terrible. None of the lines added any depth to the characters. We already knew the returning characters but the new characters could have been horrendously murdered and the audience wouldn't have really cared because the director didn't give any depth to them. Worst of all Forest Whitaker's character Detective Franck Dotzler was said to be smart numerous times, but the grand conclusion he makes at the end of the film is something the audience figured out in ten seconds. I don't want to give away the big surprise but it has to do with ""very tasty bagels.""I honestly felt bad for Liam Neeson during this movie. His acting was as good as it could be, but the script and plot were terrible. He had to carry the movie from the very second it started. I know he had a contract to do the film, but I would have demanded a rewrite if I was him because it was about a thousand times worse than the original Taken. Again, Liam Neeson was still incredible as always and only because of him, watching the movie was not a total waste of time. This movie might be an entertaining movie to watch on DVD or video on demand. That is a big might though. I do not recommend you see this movie in theaters and you should only watch it if you are having a really boring Sunday afternoon.

Yes, there are some good moments, but the movie is more entertainment than reality and not for someone who tend to have an IQ over 90. Overall the execution is more concerned with special effects than anything else. And in almost all the ""blow 'em up"" scenes, Liam comes out of these without a scratch. Only Superman could have done this is what I was thinking. But this is the problem, do not think or you will not enjoy the movie at all. And after multiple assaults on police officers, theft of multiple police vehicles, and millions of dollars of property damage no charges are levied against Supermanerumm I mean Liam.

183,rdhoran,A heaping load of crap,1,11 October 2020,"Is it too much to ask that a movie involving humans make any sense?Bryan Mills (Neeson, who was 62 years old when this was made) has been framed for a murder. He doesn't like that. It could mean a life sentence, I suppose. So what does he do?
1) Mills happens upon and lingers too long at the crime scene, so (as Megaton required) the cops can confront him. Mills supposedly overcomes two highly trained police officers with guns aimed on him, and surprises and beats the two cops unconscious, so that he can escape out the window. Yay! I wonder what the court sentence for that little piece of mischief might be?
2) Mills drops out the window about 30 feet bouncing off a lidded dumpster. No injury whatsoever. Remember, 62 years old. Unscathed.
3) It's not close to a clean escape. Cops are swarming and squad cars are everywhere. Mills gets into an extended footrace with an obviously in shape cop looking about 25 yrs old. It is easily seen that Neeson can hardly run; he's OLD for goshsakes! His full run oldster strides are laughable. But, this old man somehow keeps his young pursuer at bay, even though in every shot, the younger man gets through every obstacle, climbing fences, jumping walls, etc.
much faster than Mills. Again, fleeing like this is a crime.
4) Mills enters a random house, runs past some people having dinner, and finally enters the garage, with the cops in close pursuit. He ducks under a car and, as luck would have it, there are loose boards there that he lifts up, miraculously exposing a chute to a river underneath the garage! So he drops into the chute, after somehow replacing the boards with no footholds whatsoever. The police arrive about one second later and are baffled. Breaking and entering is a yet another crime.
5) At some point Mills gets captured. While being taken to jail in a huge police convoy, of course he overcomes his captors, and while forcing the hands of the cop who is driving, he causes huge crashes, endangering the lives of police officers, civilians, and possibly killing multiple individuals. Tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars of property damage. I'm pretty sure that's a staggering list of crimes.I kinda lost interest after that and start cleaning around the house, so I can't give you much more other than Mills kicked ass on the Russian bad guys in completely unrealistic ways, at one point holding one up to shield himself against the hail of bullets from a machine gun, dropping a chandelier onto his enemy with one bullet while not looking because he was hiding behind a corner...And the stupidity goes on and on and on.Watch this at your own risk. It's a personal insult to each and every viewer.Oh, wait. At the end the policeman (Forest Whittaker) in charge of the investigation/capture of Mills just shakes Mills hand let's him walk away!

185,josephrygaard,Before Watching: Taken 3 (2014),6,18 July 2019,"""Taken 3"" (2014) is the third and last installment of the Taken-franchise. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Much of what should be anticipated of Taken 3 can be estimated from Taken 2. If you liked that movie, you might like this one. If you didn't, you will not. Taken 3's plot does not derive any of its content from the previous two movies, but has its own storyline in a spin-off like style. The tone is less of a hitman-movie, but more of a crime thriller/spy movie. The plot gets pretty complex as it goes on, but is still decently constructed as a whole. It does require attention.Unfortunately, the fallacies are more prevalent as well as more frequently occurring compared to Taken 2 and especially Taken. Some plot devices do feel very cheap and the characters feels flat and one-dimensional. If you are however looking merely for cheap entertainment, these flaws will not be as bothersome.The severity of the violence lies a notch above Taken 2 in intensity, but still with a big step until Taken. A bit more blood is prevalent, and some deaths might be quite upsetting. All in all, Taken 3 does not feel like a subtraction to the Taken-franchise, but it is certainly not a strong addition either. It just is.My personal grade: a meagre 6/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",Taken 3

190,dreamdemon-1,The black sheep of the three,6,1 February 2015,"I'll begin by saying I enjoyed the film. While the first was actually good, the story of the third definitely outshines the second. In the end, however, the third Taken suffers a lot at the hands of the writers who spend too much time trying to force emotions on rather flat and unexplored characters.Not to say I wouldn't want to see some character depth but what we have here is so forced and so uneven that it turns regular flat action characters into pure cardboard. I can live with a methodical, cool and precise Bryan Mills but not so much with a Mills that out of the blue risks the investigation into his wife's murder to pointlessly meet his daughter in a college girls toilet. Yes, the same Mills who in the first film used what could have well been the last time he would speak to his daughter to gather intel, in a cool and calculated manner.Also, Maggie Grace shows her age. She was barely passable for a teen in the first Taken, but in the sequels she shows more of her age. A believable college girl now? Please! I generally like her, but I have to say she was probably the weakest actor in the movie.Whitaker's detective is strange. For a law enforcement office pursuing a highly trained suspect, he looks way too laid back. There's no intensity there, he seems to 'like' Neeson from the onset and he casually strolls through the investigation. Poorly done and makes the investigation just a background (which it is in the film, but it wouldn't be so in the real world).What I would have loved to see: - more of Mills' colleagues in action - more of Mills hand to hand: somehow I love Neeson's action hero in combat, regardless of excuse - more of Mills' cool intel gathering (well done in the first move, not so much afterward)What I liked: - Neeson - Neeson fighting - Whitaker at the start of the investigation - Stuart's double-take: he is villainous, a victim and the definite villain in the endWhat I disliked: - everything else",Taken 3
191,koen_smit,A joy to watch.,8,16 January 2015,"It was only recently that I got into the Bryan Mills and his family troubles by watching the first two Taken movies near the end of last year. I've enjoyed them very much so I was really anxious to see how they would continue the story. We start with Bryan Mills living a quiet life, still not understanding his daughter has grown into an adult now and helping his ex-wife by listening to her marriage troubles and mixed feelings. After her husband Stuart friendly but strongly demands Bryan to get out of the way so he can solve his problems with his wife, Bryan accepts and the setup is done. From there on in we dive into the roller coaster of action, escape and search for the truth as we well know from the first two movies. Every action scene has a purpose. Not only to survive and flee the scene, but also to gain intel.Liam Neeson is getting quite old, he is in his sixties now, and that shows throughout the movie. But having had the covert operative life his character Bryan Mills had, you can very well believe the fighting and actions he does. And he does have his 'take a breath' moments. And his emotionally stumbling through the sewers after his first escape, knowing what just happened to his family, was simply heart-breaking. You can see him think 'oh please, not this again'. Forest Whitaker might well be one of my favorite actors. He is obviously a very intelligent actor and brings that to his role of smart cop Dotzler. He found small things to give his character a bit more depth. For example the chess-piece (trying to understand the next move of his opponent) and the rubber band he plays with (trying to solve the case as the rubber band goes around the file ones solved). Not chasing any soon to be dead leads, cuz he already knows they will be dead because he is dealing with a smart fugitive. During the movie there were a few moments that I thought: it was impossible he escaped there. And unless Bryan suddenly turned into a superhero, I did not completely buy it that he did. But in a very entertaining, intelligent and exciting movie I can accept those moments. This was a joy to watch.",Taken 3

Sure, he didn't do so well in 3rd Person and there wasn't much action in A Walk Among the Tombstones, but he redeemed himself with this one. There are great gun fights and hand combat in this final film. There's nothing like the fury of a framed operative!I really hate that this was the last in the franchise because I would definitely like to see more of Bryan Mills kicking some ass! I hope the producers will reconsider doing a 4th film. Do yourself a favor and rent this movie...you won't be disappointed!",Taken 3
193,miroslavhradel,A mixture of familiar tropes that ultimately turns out to be a mediocre action flick,4,11 November 2020,"The third and final Taken movie does feel like an improvement in comparison with the laughable second part of the trilogy, but it is still plagued by many of the same problems that had come to light in the previous two installments, ultimately turning out to be just another mediocre action flick.The plot does succeed in being more interesting than the one in the second movie, but it generally feels all too familiar to come anywhere near the relative originality of the basic idea that had started the franchise. As far as its credibility is concerned, it goes without saying that a believable story is not something that one should expect from any of the three Taken movies.This time, Liam Neeson's character, a former CIA agent named Bryan Mills, discovers that his ex-wife Lenore was murdered in his apartment and quickly finds himself running away from hundreds of police officers as the prime suspect. His methods of escaping the chasers become increasingly unrealistic, allowing him to emerge unscathed from two car crashes that are immediately followed by massive explosions. Finally, he prevents a private jet from taking off by driving a Porsche 911 into it at high speed.With all the Albanian mobsters killed in the first two movies, the murder of Lenore eventually turns out to be the work of her new husband Stuart and a bunch of Russian rowdies. Of course, the villains make for a group of stereotypical and bland figures, ultimately giving me the impression that I have seen them in dozens of other films. The police officers and detectives are just as unoriginal. One of the detectives, Garcia, turns out to be comically similar to the character played by Gary Oldman in Léon, thus serving as the embodiment of Luc Besson's total lack of interest in developing the characters.Although the performances do appear to be much better than the ones in the second movie, they eventually prove to be rather unspectacular. Forest Whitaker does try his best as the leading detective and his performance turns out to be quite good. On the other hand, Dougray Scott is abysmal as Stuart, with his character being just as comical as the Russian ones.There are many chase and fight sequences, but not one of them turns out to be particularly exciting. Furthermore, a lot of camera shaking makes for a pretty lame stylistic device. Even though Taken 3 does appear to be at a higher stylistic level than Taken 2, it is still rather unremarkable in terms of its visual appearance, with many of its action sequences turning out to be nothing more than re-creations of various ideas from a handful of action blockbusters and crime series that were released over the last two decades.",Taken 3
194,Arcturus1980,Not a bad end to a fun trilogy,7,11 January 2015,"Taken 3 is a step down from Taken 2, itself a lesser film than the original. But that is to be expected and forgiven. The title could be considered an unimaginative misnomer, but it makes marketing sense.Aside from the part of Stuart (husband to Famke Janssen's Lenore), the casting is consistent. The addition of Forest Whitaker as a smart cop is for me something of a saving grace since Taken 3 offers up absurdities without question. On reflection, however, the plot has enough coherence to do the trilogy justice. Moreover, it is a joy to see Liam Neeson in this role again.The director Olivier Megaton has an irksome penchant for frenetic, up-close, disorienting action sequences whereby shots are rarely longer than two seconds. He was a little better in this regard for Taken 2, which had the benefit of superior choreography.Another personal point of contention is the casting of Sam Spruell as the top Russian villain. He has not an imposing physical constitution and quite frankly brings to mind Jim Carrey, who sported the same haircut in the Dumb and Dumber movies. Not at all what I want in a villain.I generally enjoy the films I see, and this one—notwithstanding the negatives—is no exception. However, I would not recommend it for people who are more stern in matters of taste.",Taken 3
195,VenturousArtist,"""Taken Out.""",1,11 December 2018,"The third installment in the Taken franchise was a mistake. It's a bloated thriller film that attempts a different style to the usual premise but fails to otherwise convince audiences to find enjoyment. In this story, the protagonist of the previous films is challenged to prove his innocence upon the mysterious murder of his former spouse. But he's also tasked to uncover the true murderer, those potentially connected, and either evade or fight his way through hordes of hunters.It was a seemingly intriguing idea that was ruined by horrific pacing, ridiculous editing, recycled occurrences, humdrum outcomes, expendable villains, and weak storytelling. It's a boring thriller that wastes time being a tedious drama than an action film the series was known for. Even with some middling character development, if viewers are familiar with the film's predecessors, it's not enough to redeem its deeply flawed experience.It's the final Taken film with innovation taken out.",Taken 3

Why the inspector pretends Liam is the killer even if he knows he is not ? Why waste so much of force, money on pursuit ? isn't it police's work to investigate fairly ?2. Why Liam get caught by inspector at store & later does so much of destruction on highway? He says, it's to show inspector what he is capable of, but he also mentions he doesn't want to hurt anyone.

197,orourkec-292-269155,Taken 3 is a big wave of disappointment...,6,14 April 2015,"I thought that Taken 3 was ridiculous and an insult to the audience, because it completely lacks in being gripping, lacks in originality, is too predictable, unbelievable and illogical a few times or at times, the action lacks genuine effectiveness and is boring and the direction is inconsistent. Another important flaw that needs mention is that Taken 3 brilliantly fails to improve upon Taken and Taken 2. Furthermore, it's a pity that Liam Neeson and newcomer Forest Whitaker bring nothing exciting to the film through their character personalities. After two Taken movies Liam Neeson should have been shown as a stronger character because of the plot itself (plot which is nevertheless clichéd and unoriginal) but no unfortunately no it isn't the case. It's such a pity for Whitaker too because everyone would expect that because his character is an inspector tracking down Neeson's character for a crime he didn't commit then that inspector will be a solid character but again no unfortunately no it isn't the case. Let me also tell you that the fact that Whitaker's character is playing with an elastic on his fingers in a few parts of the film and carries a chess toss with him as well is unacceptable and makes him look more like a lost character that doesn't even belong to the Taken universe in the first place. I do however reward Taken 3 for its beautiful filming and solid cast. I'm also pleased that Taken 3 changed direction: no one gets taken this time as is the franchise's usual, main formula. After two Taken movies during the course of which all family members get taken someone in the family getting taken for the third time would just sound like a strange, unnatural and unsuitable continuation for the Taken franchise and also bad family responsibility. Overall, Taken 3 is a rubbish film that looks lost and doesn't seem in the least to understand its purpose as both a movie and second sequel in general and is good enough to be flushed down the toilet. My rating: 6.1/10",Taken 3

200,michael-stenlund,This is not a 'Taken' story,5,9 October 2019,"The director either rushed this, or he did not focus on the theme. The meaning of Taken according to books about this film series, and the series themselves movies 1 and 2 means that a person or person(s) are kidnapped for trafficking. In this film, a business deal goes awry and causes an organized group of hitmen whom are ex-military to attack the family of the main character in the storyline.The plot of Taken 3, brings this rating up from 3 to 5 stars in that it had a very realistic story which could actually happen today if things go awry with a business deal effecting mercenaries from an ex military group, Russian Spetsnaz.Therefore I would like to give this a 5 out of 10 stars, and think it should have been named a title based on criminality in money transactions.

201,ItalianBombshell,"Tak3n, As Always, By Liam Neeson",8,24 July 2015,"By now, anyone who hasn't heard of the Taken franchise is either living under a rock somewhere in the desert or maybe on another planet. Either way, sorry/not sorry. Seriously, go watch them. Go, now. OK, so either you binge-watched them or you haven't heeded my words. Again, your loss. This review is full of spoilers. I adore Liam Neeson, his character Bryan, and the whole storyline. Admittedly, Taken 2 went a bit of the rails, but it was still Bryan taking care of his family. The integral piece of the puzzle, the x-factor, the bankable, almost tangible constant that keeps fans coming back for more...including me. Who doesn't love this character? A man, a father, who will stop at nothing; spare no expense, to keep his family together begins by having his teen-aged daughter, Kim, abducted overseas and sold into sexual slavery, reuniting his estranged ex-wife and daughter back into a secure, albeit, fractured family unit. To Istanbul and the revenge of the families of those who took Kim, in Taken 2. And now, poor guy gets 'taken' for another ride in the third installment. This family needed space, closure, normalcy but no, Tak3n isn't having it go down that way. All along I really didn't appreciate or like Stuart, the stepfather. Probably because the story aligns the viewer with Neeson from the get go. But now, yeah, I really don't like him. Having his wife, Bryan's ex, Lennore, killed was just going too far. Even though I guessed right from the beginning of the film, it doesn't mean I wasn't hooked. I was. I always am. Rooting for Bryan to save the day is what we do. And, of course, in the end, Neeson doesn't disappoint. Although, personally, I would have blown Stuart's head off his shoulders. But, that's the Italian in me talking. I'm glad Bryan isn't Italian. As for the storyline, it's there, in spades. Making up for the let down of 2. This time, no exotic locations. No international lines crossed. Although ""the bad guys"", seemingly, were Russian, the story didn't take us there. The story stayed in downtown L.A.. Forrest Whitaker's portrayal of the frustrated law enforcement figurehead left me cold. It didn't seem authentic. I would have preferred someone like Kevin Spacey. Someone who is known for his ""smart"" film choices. Of course, I just watched the horrendous, 'Bird', so maybe that had something to do with my distaste. I just kept waiting for a cymbal to be chucked at his head. Anyway, my feelings only, it dragged the film down. Whitaker's frustrated 'Alex Cross'-like portrayal just didn't seem to fit. Kim was suitably growing up and Lennore still elusive and, thankfully, brief in this installment. Not a big fan of Lennore. The character, not Famke. It was bound to happen sooner or later. She really just needed to die. And do long to you now. Thank you for seeing the groundwork for Neeson's kick-booty performance. R.I.P... one final note. I watched the unaltered version, not the theatrical version. While I applaud the franchise for sticking to the PG -13 ratings game, I feel as though the theatrical version wouldn't really have been enough. In comparison, I'm glad I watched the unaltered version first. The retouching and verbal reworking just didn't gel. But, A for effort. All in all, I'm secretly going for a Taken 4, but don't think it's likely. The film's ending did leave enough ambiguity for a fourth chapter though. But, I suppose, Neeson needs to sign on for that one. After all, I'm not easily Taken by just anyone.",Taken 3

204,MennoMan,Good Movie.. reviewer get real!,8,1 February 2015,"To be honest I listened to the reviewers and waited to watch this. Bad Mistake.. Too often many reviewer want to base reviews of multiple movies on the joy, excitement and plot of the first. Taken(1) was a really good movie and different than most others in this action framework. People really enjoyed Taken, it gave us the excitement of a NEW kind of movie action hero... so when 2 and now 3 came out many poor reviewers based their review on the FIRST and disregarded the movies on there own merits.So.. for the movie itself, still based on the same characters, (though actor for Stuart was changed) we again find out hero played by Liam Neeson caught up in a kill or be killed plot. Without spoilers let me state this is a little different than the previous Taken movies. However, the action is the same. We find that our mild mannered father is still up to the task of dodging bullets, disarming and taking out the enemy. Action is almost non-stop after the plot is set. The film is well made with good effects. Special effects are also great though not over the top as in many films.As stated Lenore's husband, Stuart (Dougray Scott in this film) come back in this film but is played by in this film. This was a bit out for me since Xander Berkeley set the character in the first Taken Movie. Forest Whitaker is a nice addition and give the film more depth.This film stands on it's own. A good follow-up to the Taken Story and a excellent action film. disregard those who blast this film because it is not ""As Good"" as the original.. It's a great film.. Solid 7 or 8.",Taken 3

I actually lied to myself in seeing this film for the sake of the trailer, which was a better short film than the feature length version. This film is outrageously terrible that i was cringing in embarrassment during the first act. I can't believe how amateur the cinematography, if its worthy at all to be labeled that since it was more like a 5 year old filming a birthday party with a video camera for the first time. The editing is utterly childish. These editors apparently don't know crap about editing action and performance. Wow. I could've directed, edited, and photograph a better Tak3n than this crap. Forest Whitaker, an academy award winner, was nothing more than a stereotype cop that eats bagels the whole movie. Are you kidding me? What a waste of great talent.The writing is absolutely cliché and predictable to the point where when the twist comes at the end it has no impact whatsoever. Liam Neeson does his thing, but with age, he can barely run in a foot chase with cops half his age, so they chop it so fast that he just disappears like a ghost. Apparently the director of this pile of crap did the last pile of crap and has never learned how to film a car chase or watched The French Connection, To Live and Die in L.A. or Michael Bay films. Even the shaky action scenes and chases in the Bourne films are light-years above this amateur movie. It's a poor man's version of The Fugitive crossed with a B movie version of an old Jason Bourne. What a waste. Hope Run All Night, aka Taken 4, is a better movie.",Taken 3
206,DrLex,Horrible editing further ruins already weak action scenes,3,2 June 2015,"My main beef with this film is obvious: the editing is awful. Shots rarely last longer than two seconds. I mean in general, not just during the action scenes where it is even worse: there are parts with three shot-cuts per second. Next to this ADD-induced editing, the camera is almost always zoomed in all the way, and is being shaken for no good reason. This often makes it impossible to see what is really going on.The viewer is never given the time to relax, and this gets very tedious after a while. When the next action scene starts, you just do not care because the relatively quiet scene that came before it, was already edited as if it was an action scene. This kind of spastic editing can work fine when used in short doses. This film however is an overdose lasting a 100 minutes. Even the sound design is bad: it is all squashed to the same volume with dynamic range compressors, further reducing the impact of action scenes.I have two possible explanations for this combination of the tiresome shaky cam with the frenetic editing. One, the director has a serious mental problem. Two, a double whammy: Neeson is getting too old for elaborate action scenes, and the film must have an audience as large as possible, therefore nothing graphic can be shown to allow for a PG-13 rating. To solve these two issues all at once, action is simply faked by shaking the camera and cutting shots all the time.The PG-13 rating is misplaced anyway. Kids should never be allowed to watch this junk because they would risk brain damage from the horrible editing.Even when putting the bad cinematography aside, the film is disappointing. It is a big pile of clichés with cardboard characters and contrived plot twists. I am not saying the first Taken was so much better in that regard, but at least it amply compensated with its well-directed action scenes. If you are looking for anything like the first movie, stay away. There is nothing to find here.",Taken 3

That is how I am here to write a biased and subjective review of the third installment of the action movie trilogy in which I never thought it was going to be the trilogy seeing how the initial one ended so well. If you have been brought to this page to decide whether you should watch ""Taken 3"" or not, I posit you happen to be one of these two types. The first type would be those who watched both original ""Taken"" and ""Taken 2"" which are done by two different directors that led to a major discrepancy in scores and reviews with great expectations. And the second type would be the reluctant and risky action-movie junkies whose hobby or knack is criticizing films and comparing how bad or good it has gotten from the previous sequel.Well, am I not only writing this review in the first person point of view but I also want you all to realize that if you are one of the aforementioned types, your precious time and wherewithal will be measurably TAKEN by getting reeled in by the well-edited trailer that foreshadows a group of formidable forces, comprised of CIA, FBI, and Liam Neeson that makes you want to watch it with a risk. Sadly, it does not pan out and crumble like a grain of salt. The problem is there is no chemistry between actors and its title as the climax gets subliminally evaporated by a sloppy, uncanny, and cliché setting for the following reasons. First, Liam Neeson's prowess and aptitude for fighting for the one that is TAKEN is overly depicted and making him look immortal. Forest Whitaker's presence as a LAPD detective looks irrelevant and redundant despite his role fitting him well. And the last but not least, both villains and the police who confront Liam Neeson get intentionally bowled over by being either too generous or careless. There is just not enough exposition to make it up for a series of kinks.However, I would like to give all the crew of this film some credit for making an attempt to embellish what seems to be the first highly anticipated movie of 2015 as there are some potential moments where it can be enhanced with deliberate editing and directing.

Surprisingly this film yielded more than anticipated. There were new elements added to the recurring ""abduction"" theme, and there was actually a not-too-flimsy plot. Here the audience witnessed Bryan's struggle with staying out of his ex-wife's failing marriage and then finding his deeply loved ex-wife murdered with him, of course, being framed for the act. As entertaining and adrenaline-pumping the revenge and combat scenes were, it was heartening to find the a twist (albeit superficial) in the tale; and the stereotype Russian militia gangs were not the ""final boss"".

Bryan Mills has had his wife ""taken"" from him, within death. Then you get to the rest of the movie, which is really messily done, the camera angles are really odd, the fight scenes are hard to follow (The Bourne movies did it better, just saying.) but at least all the dynamics between Bryan and his daughter Kim are really nice to see.Forrest Whittaker is introduced in this movie and he always delivers. His chemistry with Liam Neeson is fantastic. But the thing that really lets this film down is the twist reveal that it was actually Kim's step-dad now played by Dougray Scott that killed Lenore... that is completely stupid. It's like his character is so inconsistent with the character they established in the first movie, who has nothing against Bryan, but in this one, he hates him for no good reason. Messed up and stupid.This movie was a disappointing ending to the trilogy that in the end felt rushed, messy, dull and inconsistent with the first two.

So much so I got out of my sick bed and journeyed to the cinema. Okay here's the plot. Bryan Mills gets framed for his ex wife's murder. That's it. Nobody is taken. Liam Neeson is clearly tired of this franchise and is obviously in this for the money. The plot is none existent and boring, the action sequences (what there are of them) resemble a schoolyard scuffle and the camera work is so bad it's difficult to follow without going dizzy. There are a number of car chases but even they are nothing spectacular I'm afraid, certainly compared to the first movies. Also forget gun play (the director did). Or even blood effects. Simply put this movie has gone from a decent 15 to a dire 12A or PG13. its almost a U quite honestly. There are a few laughable moments............They're not supposed to be. As far as the actors are concerned. Nobody has enough to do or a script to shine with. It's a shame because I am a fan of this genre and I love the first two movies.",Taken 3

To my great pleasure, this one was a much better action movie than the second part.The story had it's twists towards the end and I was impressed by that. Liam Nesson , as always was good. I really liked Forrest Whittaker in his supporting role. Really impressed by the action sequence. Especially the hand combats. They really blew my mind.

However, it just failed in more proper plot creation and above all, the acting performances were horrible.The ending was okay, but it just wasn't okay enough to redeem all of the damage caused. Almost everything in Taken 3 was just as Kim would put it; ""predictable"".Unfortunately, let's just put Taken 2, and especially Taken 3 as a result of a unnecessary sequel.Besides the filming location, there is nothing beautiful about the movie. It's just so that the writers didn't had enough particular set of skills to make a good movie. However, they still made a wise choice though. They have put an end to Taken, finally.But let put all the mistakes away. Taken 3 was fun, a lot of reflection to the first movie (such as, Bryan's famous phone calls and the use of the sentence ""good luck""), and besides it's predictable story, Taken 3 was still thrilling to watch.",Taken 3

In his quest to prove is ""innocence"" he kills dozens of people on the highway, causes millions of dollars in damaged infrastructure and property, assaults (and possibly) kills many police officers.... and walks away a free man.. not even a fine for reckless driving.Never once is the crimes he racks up even alluded to.Has the film been a story about how he does all this to extract revenge and the final scene is him being carted off to jail for life the film would at least be redeemable.However, mass man-slaughter and destruction with zero consequences!!!",Taken 3

Once Mills figures out he has been framed for a homicide, he sets out to prove his innocence and to extract revenge on the perpetrators.Once that occurs, thats when this movie really really really(I said that 3 times) went over the top, almost to the point where it was beyond ridiculous. First of all, ""The Crime Scene"", for someone who got her throat slit, there was hardly any blood. Plus, when you actually thought about it, that was a terrible cover up framing Mills for murder by the assailants. Mills had an alibi, there was surveillance video which supported him, and there was little implication he could have been a suspect. Another point, why would it take a Law Enforcement Agency so long to find out someone's spouse has a high valued monetary insurance settlement taken out against there ""loved one"". That should be a priority in solving a homicide. I could go on and on, but I think you get the point.The action scenes were the typical ""Bryan Mills"" car chases, eluding people, gunfights, and hand to hand combat. But, we were actually entertained in seeing Mills literally disappear into thin air(I'm not kidding).Saying all that, it was somewhat entertaining, and when it comes down to it, that might be what its all about - entertainment.",Taken 3
220,fahimay,A mediocre action-thriller,5,26 January 2016,"I don't remember much of the prequels having watched them a long time back, though I guess I liked Taken 1 quite a bit. Partly, because it was one of the first Hollywood pursuit-style films I had enjoyed. But fact is, with very few exceptions, sequels tend to under-perform when compared to their former counterparts.. So I didn't expect too much from Taken 3.Liam Neeson always appealed to me as the concerned husband and father, willing to perform CIA level feats as the 'protector'. He was quite in his style, with razor sharp reflexes and enviable presence of mind. Forest Whitaker is quite underplayed, and was always 'a step behind', maybe because the director wanted the focus to be on Neeson. The plot isn't that complex to follow for a Liam Neeson movie. Though a Russian ex-military-turned-gangster is involved, it is not your typical clash with the protagonist. You kinda guess Dougray Scott, the bad-guy from MI2is not innocent as he seemed. The car-chasing, following explosions, Neeson surviving each encounter unscathed, and those affectionate moments with his daughter was there, which as a matter of fact, don't have much novelty. It seemed pretty cheesy to me that she was pregnant all through this and she wanted to name the kid after her mother.

222,jacco59,Rushed and flawed,5,2 February 2015,"""Taken 3"" is a movie that coasts on the success of its predecessors while moving away from the established template of the series. It is not a modern-western type revenge movie, but an ""innocent man on the run"" type movie. Neeson's character Byran Mills is framed for the murder of his ex-wife (I won't say who was the real killer here) and attempts to prove his innocence while on the run from the police. The cast, including Neeson, is mediocre all round, and the movie is full of action-movie clichés such as cars exploding for no apparent reason, actors jumping through glass without getting injured, and handguns that never seem to run out of bullets. There is a twist you can see coming from a considerable distance, and as the credits roll you can't help feeling like you were short-changed. ""Taken 3"" is enjoyable in the way that all predictable action movies are: only on the lowest level, the turn-your-brain-off-and-enjoy level.

I was more bored with all the tired clichés than anything else. They showed the villain early on then, dragged a rather nonsensical red herring across the trail, followed by a pretty crap twist that distracted you only because given the rest of the plot, ANYTHING was possible.Then it turns out the bad guy actually is the bad guy and because it really doesn't add up, Liam and the Cop hastily waffle up some half ass explanation. I presume for the benefit of the dim wits in the Focus Group who didn't get the feeble plot, nor that the feeble plot was actually simply feeble. I'd lost interest well before that despite they hadn't done all the Action Sequences, still had a few to trundle out, and the obligatory last chase after the villain grabs the girl and drags her along for no reason at all.It's hard to catalog all the clichés, especially in the action scenes. Stop me if you've seen the wrong way speed chase down the freeway, with the inevitable tumbling heavy objects flattening everything in their path before bouncing over our hero.The super bad Russian ex-commando, the one everyone kills themselves to avoid, simply can't hit Liam Nielsen for love nor money. Inside a lounge room! Because all he has is a super gun that fires a zillion bullets a second! Liam runs through it all unscathed. Everything around him gets shredded to demonstrate just how dangerous these guns are!At that point ""we're going to need a bigger gun!"" would have raised an easy laugh.The ending was pretty lame and just seemed to run out of puff. After which it looks like they are setting Liam up to save his granddaughter as the next target. That is at least a couple of ""Takens"" too far for me.",Taken 3

Luckily the last 30-40 minutes make up for it but even then it's very diluted (how does a near naked man get shot at very close range twice and despite bullet holes there's no perceivable blood?).So in the context of a Taken movie it's a bit weak but as a thriller it's worth a watch :)If they do make a Taken 4 lets hope they go back to being bad ass mofo with painful to watch action sequences and maybe get his old team in on the action a bit too as they're just too cool to spend their time in the background!",Taken 3

His movements are slow, his running gait is really bad and he appeared to be totally distracted.Dougray Scott took on Xander Berkley's role from the previous movie and he just wimped out. He is a good actor, but this was a wrong casting choice.Forrest Whitaker plays the usual ""how-do-it-happen-but-I-can-figure- it-out"" act - no different from his other movies. Wrong casting choice.Maggie Grace always looked older than her part. And she looks every day of her 31 years. In another day, another movie she would be playing Neeson's wife.Famke Janssen was hardly in the movie. The premise was stupid. There should have just been an international espionage story instead of a domestic marital spat. Disappointing.I thought these guys could not make anything worse after Taken 2. I was wrong.

The embarrassing action sequences were horribly handled and even the stunt double was noticeable, they were all over the place. The antagonist was very typical and the protagonist was invincible, numerous certain death experiences where the protagonist somehow survives without a single scratch. The first taken film was fantastic, intelligent, tense and intriguing. Taken 3 lacks all elements and comes off almost humorous thanks to its flimsy direction and pathetic villains. I mean no one was even taken in this movie. The runtime felt excessively long and the predictable loop holes never worked.

229,King_man,Taken down by the script,5,21 July 2015,"I liked Taken and seeing Liam play out of character but play it well. A script that stretched credulity but who cared, and seeing an older action hero was a nice change of pace. Taken 2 was certainly a big step down and then there's 3. The action is still there and Liam again plays his character for all it's worth. But that's the limit of the good side. Others have commented on Whitaker's performance and I'll only second their thoughts. Maybe it was the script or maybe he was trying too hard to be Denzel Washington in ""Inside Man"" but one thing he wasn't was a believable special investigator. The remainder of the police force, while not completely Keystone Cops, weren't ""badge ready."" The heavies were a step up but were clearly going to be fodder to Liam's rampaging bull. And so we get to my biggest criticism. I don't know the body count but it was double digits to be sure, all but one at the hands of Neeson. Add to this Neeson assaulting police, carjacking a no-name civilian, destroying public property with gay abandon, and causing a highway pileup where the morgue certainly should be welcoming multiple new residents from carefree drivers yet he gets released by Whitaker with not so much as a dressing down. Earlier Whitaker had said his job was to bring in suspects, not determine their guilt but so much for that position by the end of the movie. All in all, Liam was a plus and there was plenty of action but the minuses brought this down to the very mediocre category. Taken 3 is a sad way to send off the series.",Taken 3

What sense does it make to meet with his daughter when cops are on his/her tail. 2. This man seems to be able to exit exploding vehicles, even while in an elevator shaft. 3. Even if he is a super spy, no one would forgive him for just making a huge row of car accidents with multiple deaths, just to get away from cops. If he were that good, they would not have caught him at the gas station. 4. He has the sindrome 'the good guy does not get shot or hit' all throuought the movie. 5.

And he completely goes off his rocker, scheming to pay back money he owes.The plot is extremely boring and very simple. There is nothing that leaves you wondering. But even with such a simple plot, there are holes. Why would Stewart arrange to kill Bryan Mills (Neesan), when he needs him to take out the Russian Mobster? I was also puzzled at Forrest Whittaker's portrayal of the cop in charge. What a pathetic performance from such a good actor.At the end of the day Bryan Mills runs amok through the streets, shooting and attacking like crazed psychopath - All to save his daughter? But there was not really any proof that she was even in mortal danger at the time.

237,SConIrish,"Taken 3 is no Bourne 3, it isn't even Die Hard 3.",4,7 January 2015,"One of the watershed moments of Liam Neeson's career was his sudden emergence as a viable action star in the original Taken, directed by Frenchman Pierre Morel from the Luc Besson stable of B grade R rated genre films. The memorable catchphrase, ""I don't know who you are but if you don't let my daughter go I will find you and I will kill you,"" became a pop culture reference point. In his late fifties at the time, this was a marked shot in the arm for his career and allowed the Irish actor to diversify his considerable talent. Unfortunately the sequels that have quickly followed, as if rushed to production to align with arelease schedule, lack the brutal, efficient energy of the original. They seem to get worse with each film. The R rating has been replaced with a PG rating to ensure more people see the film. Olivier Megaton has directed the second and third films, whilst Morel has recently completed the Sean Penn action vehicle The Gunman with a killer cast including Idris Elba and Javier Bardem. Writers Besson and Kamen clearly decided to infuse a plot into the new film. The early death of a leading character, sets up a Fugitive like scenario in Los Angeles in which Bryan Mills becomes the hunter and the hunted. Dirty corrupt Russians figure, with distinctive tattoos to telegraph they are the bad guys and Forest Whitaker playing the Tommy Lee Jones role spends much of the film eating bagels and twisting a rubber band around his fingers to signal intelligence. The action scenes are edited in a way designed to confuse, the freeway sequence as a case in point, I had little idea of what was happening from one-second to the next, thanks to the rapid fire editing techniques and noise levels deployed. In comparison the Bourne films use the same style but the result is breathtakingly satisfying in comparison. The editors Nicolas Trembasiewicz and Audrey Simonaud have a history of music video work together with Besson films.Perhaps Taken 4 will be an origin story, where we learn how Bryan Mills attained his unique skill-set. As the credits rolled on the latest installment I was reminded of the closing montage from 22 Jump Street as the series progressively gets more ridiculous until Schmidt and Jenko end up in outer space in 2121 Jump Street.

Freight containers can apparently fly into the sky if a lorry stops, cars can reverse at 100mph (or 160km/h), the best of the best, most paranoid, CIA super soldiers forget to lock the front door of there house. Super Spetsnaz (or spetnats in the film) soldiers evidentially can't hit a target 10m in front of them. Wounds heal on dead people and form a nice scar only hours after being killed and there is no blood at all, whether you've fallen off a building, been stabbed with a bottle or shot in the liver.I'm boring myself just writing about it.Not the worst film, decent production values, but it's slow, uneventful and catered for the 12 rated audience.",Taken 3

I love Liam Nesson, but even he knows he is going through the motions. Director Olivier Megaton thinks trying to be Paul Greengrass will make the action scenes better. It doesn't. All the bloodless PG-13 action consists of horrendous shaky camera work and quick 2-second cuts which makes it impossible to see who is fighting who. The story even is more ridiculous with Nesson as a man on the run. At least Taken 2 tied into the first film and someone was actually taken. this was something that it ca not be described.

240,mumbhaaai,It ends here. Good.,5,14 January 2015,"Taken 3 is directed by the Mr. Megaton (it sounded like Particle Physics, of course, take away the intelligent factor from it). As the name suggests, it's the third installment of the movie Taken that came out about 6 years back and was an instant hit, because Liam Neeson has a particular set of skills in the movie, that makes the audience wanting more. In the acting department, the guy has particular skills no one has. Tall structure, calm and strong voice, and a man who looks like he means no harm but will not think twice to come at you if needed.Movie starts off with a Russian gang talking in English with a Russian accent asking for their money. Everyone has numerous tattoos for ease of recognition, because honestly, you won't remember their faces due to lack of acting skills. They don't think twice before killing anyone, just to leave a message. Message saying they need to be ""Taken"" (yes, pun intended) seriously. Used to be a song from the 90s, Taken Seriously. And then the movie shows how the innocent Mr. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) with extra set of ""particular"" skills, is charged with his ex-wife's murder. How he comes out of the situation is what the movie is all about.Action scenes are terribly shot! A very amateurish style of execution and the editing is heavily inspired by Mr. Paul Greengrass (Bourne Ultimatum) for the shaky cam effect and Mr. Tony Scott (Spy Game, the aerial view and Man on Fire for slick cuts and editing). In fact the action scenes make it look like shot on a regular homemade video and then edited on iMovie for special effects.The protagonist can fall off a cliff, off the elevator, blasts vehicles and nothing ever happens to him. Not only that, he's also never accused of any other crime except the killing of his ex-wife. He took down LA for God's sake! I would want this kind of man behind bars for entirely ruining a city and putting so many lives in danger. The last action scene, with the Russian leader fighting in his underwear looked like a scene sponsored by Calvin Klein. Zero thrill, in fact, outright funny. Shaky cam can give a very good effect for movies, but once it's overly done, it takes away the thrill and adds immaturity to the scenes. That's what has happened here. Due to lack of a good script, the entire movie has not one single stable shot. Either the camera is moving from left to right, zooming in, or there's an aerial view. The background score was heavily boring, it absolutely did not go in-line with the thrill that the audience is supposed to experience.Movie was an absolute waste of time and money, and I honestly felt the original Taken that came out in 2008 was a much better fare. Liam Neeson is the only saving grace in the entire movie. The guy has personality, no doubt about that. Hats off to him for carrying this movie, because honestly, every other person in the entire movie was dull and boring.It's ironic how they kept saying to each other in the movie, that you're predictable. I felt the script was predictable. Watch ""Ek Tha Tiger"" or ""Spy Game"" or ""Bourne Ultimatum"" or ""Man on Fire"" for a much better thrilling experience. I recently saw ""The Equalizer"" and it was quite a gripping experience. Watching Bollywood will give you more acting per square feet area, since the movie is 3 hours long. So you can have more value for money. I'm joking obviously. Or just play Tekkin 3, a video game that came out in the 90s.",Taken 3
241,JanisU,At least something,8,22 July 2015,"Well it is for sure not 8 star movie, but I gave it 8 stars because there is not a lot of good movies for thriller/crime/action genre.Honestly first 20 minutes were really boring as well the plot for this movie, yeah hundred times seen, but it kind a gave me nostalgic childhood memories when movies were all about same and like this. So don't think you will get something fresh and super exciting, for sure you will be able to predict almost everything and there will not be too many mind boggling things on it! But the good part is that it was rather fun and I watched it all from 20 minute till the end and yeah there were not too many cheesy scenes, where the main actor is shot and he some how survives and kill all bad guys, but excluding shot part he actually does all these things!I can't say that actors played brilliantly , but they were good and this movie may be fun if you are not a part from yolo culture or really hard stuff man, for normal people this may be a good entertainment in the name of old days when such a movies were not a deficit!",Taken 3

The big thrill about the first Taken, its USP, was seeing an actor with quite a few miles on the clock in an action film who'd quite obviously been to the gym, done some martial arts training and really put in the hours in preparation for an action film. Well, at least to men knocking on 40, it was.No more. This is all fast edited claptrap. It is little more than above average Steven Seagal film. Possibly director Oliver Megaton's fault - okay, he has a cool name _ but he can't direct action.

245,Moviefreak4653,Underwhelming Finale,5,25 February 2015,"Taken was the film of 2008 that, in my mind, took home the award for ""Best Mindless Entertainment."" Of course, in actuality, Taken was kind of a good movie but, regardless, a guilty pleasure through and through. It wasn't as great as the likes of a Die Hard, but it was what it was – an entertaining shoot-em-up action movie, but with appeal in their use of family bond. By Taken 2, a lot of that was put to the test and, if anything, detracted from the appeal of the original. It's not that Taken 2 was bad, for it certainly took the level of ""mindless entertainment"" farther than the original did; however, for that reason, the 2nd film's ultimate problem was just that: it pushed the mindless entertainment aspect of the first film way too far. You know how in action movies people (namely the hero) unabashedly blows stuff up, causes massive car crashes, and shoots up numerous people, but they never get arrested or charged for obstructing justice or disturbing the peace? Well, Taken 2 was probably the crowning achievement of exemplifying that theme (just throw grenades into public areas so I can hear where you are). For that reason, I was a little weary about Taken 3: A film that isn't bad but isn't necessarily good and, if anything, proves Taken may have been ultimately better left as a standalone film to begin with.In some ways, I admired Taken 3 certainly more than I did that of Taken 2. For one, this film is more of an adventure type film, as opposed to a purely action based one that the predecessors might have been. The film isn't constantly worried about having ""another one bites the dust"" moment and, if anything, I appreciated how the film was taking time to actually focus on the story and on the aspects of death, loss, and grief. Still, some of the storytelling methods were questionable: For example, do you really think a man as smart as Bryan would run from the police? And some of his techniques to prove his innocence (such as his sudden possession of resources or outside contact) seem like lazy writing to me, for many of them appear out of nowhere without having been set up properly. Also, while I appreciated the film trying to add some twists to the plot (some of which works), I think, in the context of being a concluding chapter to this trilogy, it pretty much ignores this fact and, rather than pay tribute to or even really acknowledge the first two films, we get, more or less, a standalone sequel that has not much of anything to stand on.By this time around the characters feel like caricatures of their former selves, and the script doesn't seem to do much to enhance this. Rather than have the majority of them mature but keep their same charm, I think the film is a little too desperate to focus on Bryan Mills' ""special set of skills"" (i.e. his technique of relying on precision and accuracy) rather than the character behind the skills. Really, the film doesn't seem that interested in any of the villains and, save for a few, the fight scenes aren't near as entertaining because many of the antagonists are just very void – as if to suggest that we should want the ""bad"" characters to be killed simply because the film says we should want them to be killed. Maybe it's just that all the characters have overstayed their welcome? That being said, the acting is still pretty good and, while it does feel to some degree many of the actors are just there by contract, they still don't condescend the material and they give it their all. Maggie Grace, again, has really proved herself worthy of emotionally charged scenes, and I hope to see her in more serious films. Also, by Taken 3 a lot of what made the first one likable, and the second one tolerable, starts to become slightly comedic this time around. One could argue that the film is intentional in this but, come on, why try and trick the audience into thinking a certain character is supposedly dead from a big action stunt when we know there's at least 40 minutes of running time left in the film? The bottom line is that, for Taken 3 to be cited as the concluding piece in this trilogy, it kind of fails as a final installment, and barely cuts it as being a passable sequel. By Taken 3 you want to feel satisfaction and even warmth and comfort in this being the end – a celebration of the first 2 films and whatever legacy that remains. In the end it's more ""Meh, I could have done without this one.""",Taken 3
246,alexgarcia732805,"Bad Editing; Shaky Cam; Uninspired Action. A Half-@$$ed Conclusion to the ""Taken"" Franchise. (Review By AlexG732)",6,1 February 2015,"I was excited to hear that the Taken films would become a trilogy, because I had loved Taken (and had watched it so many times I could remember most of its iconic lines). The first Taken was dark, gritty, and very personal for Bryan Mills--his daughter was abducted and was soon going to be prostituted, he had little time to find her, and they were growing apart as she grew older. Taken 2 was not as good as the first one, but respectable in its own right. Taken really felt like standalone story, so Taken 2 detracted from that and kind of felt unnecessary. Nevertheless, I honestly don't know why people complained so much about Taken 2. Taken 2 expanded well on the characters and furthered themes from Taken. Sure, Taken 2 might've seemingly pulled a ""Hangover 2"" move and became a rehashed version of it's predecessor. But it had some interesting juxtaposition, as Bryan and Murad (father of Marko, who was tortured then killed by Mills in Taken) were both fathers seeking what they viewed as rightful vengeance for actions perpetrated against their offspring. Taken and especially Taken 2 also both had exotic scenery & locations in Europe (Paris in T1and Istanbul in T2), which really helped sell the films. Taken 3 probably made a good choice when it decided to NOT have the film's plot revolve around someone being ""taken"". (How come they never use the word abducted or kidnapped?) However, being set in a typical American city (Los Angeles) and using a pretty generic story (innocent person framed for a crime, must find ones responsible) both didn't set the odds in Taken 3's favor. The whole ""framed"" trope is not a very effective plot device, because *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* Stuart (Lenore's husband) and Oleg Malankov (Stuart's boss, of a sort) were both involved in Lenore's murder, not as revenge against Bryan, but because of an unpaid debt between the two (and to get her life insurance money). Lenore was killed as punishment from Oleg Malankov against Stuart. Therefore, there is no real meaningful conflict between Malankov and Bryan, as Bryan was simply involved in the entire mess as a scapegoat (and Malankov is set as a villain far too late into the film). Even though Malankov is supposedly some sort of bad@$$, he is a terrible shot and cannot get a single hit on Bryan. Bryan and Stuart's dynamic happens to be convoluted and unsatisfactory. ***END OF SPOILERS, END OF SPOILERS, END OF SPOILERS***Taken 3 is honestly sub-par and mediocre, especially compared to it's predecessors. I don't even know why Forest Whitaker is in T3; he is such a stereotypical by-the-book cop. I think another actor (Denzel W, Idris E, Samuel L. J) might've been better suited for his role. Unlike Taken 1&2, little time is spent on further developing characters, as the film is very fast-paced. There is action, but it is not very tense or exciting. How are we even supposed to root for Mills to fully kick ass when he's sometimes going up against American cops and possibly endangering civilians? Not to be racist, but it was easy to cheer Mills on as he defeated hordes of evil foreigners. (You could tell from looks who was a bad guy! :P) In chase scenes, shaky camera work truly ruins the fun; they're very choppily and awkwardly edited as well. CGI and big stunt sequences look low budget; Taken 1&2 looked better! The whole film is a half- @$$ed conclusion to the Taken films, with mediocre acting, an uninspired plot, cliché and stereotypical characters (smart person has chess piece & rubberband to fiddle with), ""dues ex machina"" moments, unimpressive and overdone action sequences, etc. I blame Olivier Megatone and the other crew members (screenwriter, camera crew) for the faults of what could've been a satisfying conclusion to the Taken trilogy. However, despite everything I said earlier, I cannot deny that some younger (funny cause I am pretty young) and more carefree part of me enjoyed watching Bryan Mills have one last adventure (if indeed this is the last Taken film). I have some fond movie memories of Liam Neeson, and I enjoy most of his films (like Non-Stop in 2014). If you're not as cynical or critical as most movie critics eventually become, you may very well enjoy Taken 3. Score: 6.9",Taken 3

248,blueyourrivalbot,Just the same story as literally any other action movie,5,17 June 2021,"You got the stereotypical rich villain with the Russian sidekicks, you got the main motivation for the protagonist. I could go on and on about the camerawork and the editing style. And I will.The cuts in the first fight scene, where Bryan escapes from the cops are way too short, you can't even comprehend what is going on. At least the beginning and end of the scene were not so shaky. The constant need of zooming in on what is happening is not needed. I don't even get what you gain for zooming in constantly during action sequences like an early 2000's action movie. It's annoying and useless. Most if not all of the fight scenes in this movie suffer from this.The stunts were all right, nothing too special. Definitely worse since you can't comprehend what's going on. The punches also looked significantly weaker and looked like it relied mostly on sound effects, which further strays away from a realistic point. With a budget like this movie, I'd expect something much better, considering how the prequels were better, and less jumpy.The scenes which involved Bryan needing to download phone records, etc. Looked pretty good for a movie that is focused on the fight scenes. Although I think most of the money went to the CGI device that downloads the GPS records, this could've been avoided if he had just gotten a phone with this same program. It looked nice, but it was definitely not needed.There were also many things that just didn't make sense that were only there because the story needed it. This series of movies is the prime example of how sequels of movies get worse and worse. The first Taken, amazing. The second Taken, not the best. The third Taken, it probably is the end of the series. I hope they don't make any more of these as there isn't anything original anymore. I guess they can take one of Bryan's friends or something, and even then it would probably make for a better movie.Overall, there was so much missed potential, and this movie failed to deliver. It's sad to see this series ending like this, but if you don't want to be disappointed, then don't watch this.",Taken 3

250,karizmabadrinath,Disappointing end to the Trilogy,7,9 January 2015,"Whenever a Film is planned to go for a Trilogy, it just takes off heavily in the first part, travels smoothly during the second part and ends up with a collision in a tragic manner in the last/3rd part; I experienced this shock during the final part of ""The Hobbit"" trilogy by the end of 2014 which was a lot disappointing; Now it the same end to the most awaited ""Taken 3"". The title itself is not justified in this film; We all know Kim is taken by the antagonist in both the first two parts; But in this part no one is taken rather than Bryan's wife is killed; So ""Killed"" is the correct title for this film; It also fails to impress the audience with its sloppy screenplay; Performances:- The film largely depends on one of my favorite actors and the lead character (Bryan)Liam Neeson. He really takes the credit for a stupendous performance;It is to be noted that he is getting very old, but apart from that he run, jumps, fights and attracts us with his affection with his daughter Kim; Forest Whitaker as LAPD should have been given more importance;He has a major role in this film but the director used him just to advertise the ""Doughnut"" as he seems to be eating Doughnut throughout the film; Negatives:- The so called twists and the turning points which are very essential for an action entertainer is really missing in this film; There is a Twist in this film which is predictable in the first 30 minutes of the film itself; No one can be criticized for their performance in this film except the direction and its presentation.

They are such amateurs that they make the husband of Lenny the bad guy?! That and extremely bad editing and camera movement made this close to a B movie. Also there are so many stupid choices! I will limit them to 10.1. When they mention phone numbers with 555 it takes people out of the movie experience. That is a stupid move and the first reason Olivier shouldn't be directing ****.2. Mills randomly shows strangers picture of his daughter.3. When they block logos with stickers it takes people out of the movie experience. That is a stupid move and the second reason Olivier shouldn't be directing ****.4. Police predict Kimmy will take the bugged sweater and use it for days so they can listen.5. Audi is labeled A8 in the police report when that car does not exist. It is a R8. (not a big deal, but you are making a multi million dollar movie you should not make stupid mistakes like that.6. What is it with Megatron and his boner for beeping computers. Computers do not beep when lights flash. Idiot.7. Security cameras do not have blinking red lights on them and definitely not BEEPING noises! Idiot! 8. Ex CIA operatives do not let arms dealers stand freely in situation rooms.9. Phones do not randomly beep indicating there is an airport near you.10. Brian Mills would never let Lenny be married to an arms dealer. Olivier would know this if he had bothered to watch the brilliant Taken 1 before ruining the franchise.To sum up I highly recommend everyone who watches Taken 2 and or 3 to do so as independent movies without any connection to Taken 1. Olivier Megaton should not be making movies of this caliber. He should not be making movies at all.

254,thejasvi,Embarrassing mess of a Film,2,5 April 2015,"Before anyone says, it's Taken 3, what do you expect? I expect people who make millions of dollars as supposed storytelling to perform the fundamentals of basic storytelling, that's what I expect.I remember Taken 2 being disappointing, but I don't remember it being as bad as Taken 3, a film that is full of nonsensical moments. From the opening scenes, you just know the screenplay was written by Besson & Kamen over a weekend in their Beverly Hills mansion, and by the closing scene, you know that is exactly what happened. What I don't get is how Neeson and Whitaker allow themselves to deliver such tripe. Virtually nothing in this film makes sense, I won't go into too many details, unless you get distracted by MTV editing, you'll be shaking your head literally every other minute. But the last scene in particular literally made me shout out at the TV. Neeson is seemingly framed for his wife's murder (the motive of which makes no sense by the end, even the framing itself is laughable), and there are two elements involved some text messages and some bagels. Whitaker at the scene of the crime sits looking at them both, and if you have decided to watch this film with any part of your brain turned on, you'll be screaming at him for not working out the obvious. The film apparently plays in real time, because just over an hour later Whitaker reveals ""yeah i knew you were innocent from the beginning, because of the bagels"".. he may as well have said ""we knew you were innocent, but we needed to chase you otherwise there'd be no excuse for you to trash a whole load of police cars, potentially risk the deaths of many innocent people, destroy an elevator shaft, and for you to kill more Eastern Europeans so Luc Besson can buy a bigger mansion to write his next masterpiece in"".There's a part shortly after Whitaker leaves the crime scene, and Dougray Scott asks Whitaker if he knew about the events of Istanbul, Whitaker may as well say ""well, duh, off course i've seen the last movie, who hasn't, $600million at the box office, why you think I'm here bro, we going to make some bank!! Just look at me and say stuff, don't worry about what you're saying though, no one cares, they're tweeting each other, waiting until Neeson shoots someone. Look, I made my character carry around a chess piece and play with a rubber band to give my character appear to have some depth, even though i'm literally the worst detective ever"". Literally a few scenes later, Whitaker explains to his pawns that there are no records on Neeson since he joined Special Forces in his 20's, but is magically aware of the events of the last film. Forget the fact this man seemingly went to a lot of trouble and risking his life many times to save his wife, he now decides to go buy some bagels then kill her?I felt embarrassed that I got roped into watching the film, purely based on how good the first movie was. Thankfully I didn't pay any money, though 2 hours of anyone's time has to be worth something? This is the logic of such film franchises ""Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me"", it's literally as if the film-makers are saying ""we're even now"". Anyone versed with films knew the moment they heard about ""Taken 2"", that it was the pure example of a sequel that wasn't going to be any good, the first film had no right to be as good and enjoyable as it was. The sequel is literally as pointless as you can imagine, it is just an excuse to see Neeson kill people, and for the most part that side of things is fun. The sad news was that the sequel made more money than the original, despite the poor critical reception. The next sequel was inevitable, and we, the film going audience basically told Besson and Co. ""you made an awful, pointless film, yet we rewarded you with money, please give us another even more awful film and we will give you more money, don't worry about the script, just make sure Neeson kills people in a cool manner"". There was no need for a good script, I doubt Besson and Kramer even wrote it to be honest, they most likely got some poor grad student to write it within a week, and paid them to take the credit, so they could say in the marketing that it was written by the same guys that wrote the original we loved so much, and Luc Besson, we really liked his films from 20 years ago. ""Just make sure there are 3 acts, midpoint all that stuff they expect, and Neeson needs to kill at least 10 people from Russia or the Ukraine, who cares, make sure they sound like bad men. And the twist with this one is that Neeson will be on the run, because his wife has been 'taken' away from him.. get it?! genius right"".Only problem is he only kills 9 people.. one of them can't bear the stupid dialogue anymore and kills himself.. no really, it's the most believable and honest moment in the film, it happens 5 minutes after Neeson develops the power of teleportation and escapes a car while it rolls off the side of a small cliff. 1 star for making an actual film the 2nd star is for tricking me into watching this utter piece of tripe.",Taken 3
255,tomas1810,a great Sequel and Hopefully not the end of the Franchise.,10,13 January 2015,"Yesterday was finally the big Premiere of Taken 3 in Dubai. The Venue was the Novo Cinemas Cineplex. This was probably the taken_3_movie_poster_1biggest Movie Premiere that has ever happened in Dubai. Around two thousand (2000) people attended the Premiere which took place at the same time in all 10 Cinemas of the venue.Liam Neeson himself who stars in the movie as main character was present as well which gave the whole Premiere an amazing Charisma. He took lot of pictures with Fans and even visited every screening to say a few words. A really cool guy.Biggest difference to the first two parts is probably that initially nobody is really Taken, that does change in the final of the movie, but initially Bryan tries to uncover who has really murdered his wife.An interesting addition to the third installment is Forest Whitaker who plays Franck Dotzler the Police chief. He brings a lot of fun and entertainment to the movie. I personally found it really funny how he played with the rubber band throughout the full movie until finally using it to close the file.While in the beginning of the Movie quite some time is taken to explain the situation between Bryan and his ex wife and her new husband as well as his now pregnant daughter shortly after the action takes over and does not stop until the movie finishes.Unlike the first two Taken Installments Taken 3 comes up with a not really expected Plot Twist towards the end which is changing everything. or better said Bryan has to hunt down one more person that was not on his list initially...Being the last installment of the Taken Series (until another one is announced , Taken 2 was as well the last one before) I have really enjoyed it. It is not often that a third installment reaches the same or in this case a better level than the previous installments.This is certainly one to watch and such a great movie early in the year makes a lot of hopes for a great Movie year.

257,rpr-46-242049,Terrible Direction-waste of time,3,19 January 2015,"This review contains some spoilers.The biggest problem with this movie is the central premise: if the police are trying to arrest you for a crime you did not commit, you can create whatever level of death and destruction you deem necessary to escape and prove your innocence. At the end of the movie, the main police character, Forrest Whitaker, tells Mills (Liam Neeson) that Mills' hacking the police computer is a crime and Mills could be arrested. They both have a quiet chuckle and Neeson is ""free to leave"". After assaulting a number of police officers, wrecking several police cars, stealing a police car, throwing officers out of moving cars, shooting the obligatory dozen bad guys and causing a freeway crash that is supposed to be one of the highlights of the movie, hacking the police computer would be the least of Mill's problems.Prior ""Taken"" movies require some suspension of your disbelief. One guy creates total havoc and kills several dozen bad guys and then walks away with family member in hand. This is theoretically possible because Mills leaves the country after all the death and destruction. This movie takes place in America. In the world where Taken 3 takes place, if you uncover an evil plot and confine your killing to the guys who have the right tattoos, Forrest Whitaker will smile genially and send you on your way. This movie requires that you be a complete idiot.Then there are the mistakes. Brian Mills finds the body of a main character in his bed whom he tries to revive by patting the wrist!

There is an ease and rapport between the central characters, which makes dialogue and interaction, effortless and seamless.The story lines are as fresh and new as they were back in 2008, when 'Taken' first hit our screens and still have the power to keep me glued to the edge of my seat, from start to finish.Yes!

260,Malgus,Hopefully they won't make more,4,28 February 2015,"The first Taken was a decent flick, particularly due to its combination of action and thriller, and its theme. Watching a father doing all he can to save his daughter from the worst fate possible and deliver justice to the scumbags responsible, was strangely enjoyable and satisfying. It wasn't a particularly realistic movie, but it still felt fresh among countless ""Michael Bay"" type action circus films. The second one was quite disappointing. It was defiled by Olivier Megaton's directing skills, absurd antics, pathetic villain, and...well, Maggie Grace. Yet it still had at least some residual Taken flavor to it. And now we have THIS.Arguably Tak3n is even worse than its predecessor. It has more in common with Columbiana than it has with original Taken: ridiculous plot, dumb bulletproof hero, dumb bad guys, even dumber cops, absurd PG-13 action in shaky-cam. Only instead of Zoe Saldana, we get to see bored elderly citizen a.k.a Liam Neeson fighting Russian thugs in underwear.It's kind of strange that Luc Besson and Co don't seem to understand what made Taken stand out. I had thought that perhaps Taken 2 was a misfire, an unfortunate accident, but apparently not. I guess they truly believe that common sense has no place in action movies. Needless to say, if you're expecting something resembling the original movie, don't bother with this.",Taken 3
261,jordan-maxwell,Taken the Mick,1,28 July 2016,"I mean...Just wow! The term 'flogging a dead horse' has never been more appropriate for any film in history. Firstly I'll say this isn't officially the worst film ever made. It's marginally better than Batman vs Superman, though that is like saying suffocation is mildly more enjoyable than drowning.After 'Taken's' success the studios have decided to force two sequels down our throats much like Marvel Studios have done with the Avengers, as they believe we both want and need to see them. Well I've got some news for them, and not to paraphrase Nigel Farage's immigration speech, but we don't want them, we never wanted them, its time for them to go. Now while Taken 2 hurt and made me need to pop a few paracetamol tablets to remove the headache it caused - I feel after Taken 3 I'm going to need emergency care. Never before has a film made me feel more like I was in need of a hernia exam. As a matter of fact I imagine a hernia exam would have been more fun. 1) If we start off with the plot. Now just imagine a blank piece of paper. Okay your pretty much filled in on that section. Now onto the acting. Liam Neeson plays every Liam Neeson character post 2001. Secondly, the villain has the stereotype that matches a loud Italian. What is original however, is the writers decision to use Russians as the bad guys in the movie. Who would have thought!? Now they at least deserve creativity points and a Smiley Sticker for that.But the best of the best my dear friends, is of course the big man. Forrest Whitaker. I mean his name is quite ironic seeing how the character he plays has the brain functionality to that of Forrest Gump. I mean the guy LITERALLY picks up a bag of BAGELS and smells them in case it may have something important to do with the case. Lucky for him isn't it - but I'll get to that later. But all in all Forrest Whitaker plays probably the most worst character ever made in a movie. I now actively hate Forrest Whitaker!There was a point in the movie where I felt his character actually liked the fact that Bryan Mills escaped and was causing havoc. In his mind he has been watching too many cat and mouse detective shows and though 'Now's my time to shinelet me get my chess piece'. So he decides to carry this chess piece throughout the movie to symbolize how he's playing a 'game' with Bryan Mills. (Slaps forehead*) Moreover, he seems to always know Bryans plans. There's a scene when Mills is locked up in a car by the police and Whitaker calls up to warn them that 'hes playing a game – get out of there'. So lets rewind that thought. The head detective of this case tells the police who have their suspect in custody to 'let him go' as he has a 'feeling' that Mills has a plan to escape. Now I'm no detective but I would start to question my bosses actions if he told me to let go the prime suspect over a hunch. But luckily for plot purposes – it works out exactly as Whitaker had anticipated. Also, I want to give a shout out to the editing department for actively trying to create epileptic fits in the cinemas. One of the best parts of the movie is when Mills tries to contact his daughter while he's on the run so he ACTUALLY poisons her so he would meet her in the girl's bathroom. I mean one could just send a note to his daughter to meet her in the toilet but obviously Liam Neesons trying to go for Father of the Year so the audience will let it slide. Sorry actually the best part could be when Mills survives a car crash that falls 100ft down a hill and explodes. How do the writers explain such phenomenon? Some clever plot twist I hear you ask? Well of course the writers solve this with a 5 second flashback showing Liam Neeson kneeling in a nearby hole on the hill to explain how he survived.Little issue here – that still doesn't explain how he actually escaped the car crash? I mean its like them explaining James Bond surviving a plane crash by showing a flash back of him eating ice cream in Florence. Oh he didn't die as he was here all along. Now some films wrap up a mystery by some old file evidence, confession or last minute witness. How does Forrest solve the case? Bagels, apparently. They were warm. I mean one has to ask themselves what kind of guy goes out for warm bagels, and comes back and commits a murder? This was a genuine line from the film. Read that back and look in the mirror knowing people were PAID to write that. Do you feel good about yourself? Do you? Also, apparently bagels are all you need to get people off a crime. Mills destroyed half the city – killed a bunch of guys, beat up policemen, poisoned his offspring but its okay as he remembered to keep his bagels at an appropriate room temperature. Happy days for all! So to sum up a warm pastry saves the day. Now you know if you're ever planning on committing a murder for god's sake take a visit to your local bakers. It may save your life. It seems the only thing TAKEN from this film was my FREE time. And on that note enjoy the rest of your day.",Taken 3

265,appiusa,Slow down ! This movie is terrible.,2,27 January 2015,"The biggest problem I had with this movie was the fast shots. For crying out loud ! It felt like I was watching a fast paced music video on steroids. I don't think that even Crank (which is a movie that is supposed to be fast paced and packed with adrenaline) had scenes this fast. On many occasions I just wanted to shout STOP ! Slow down ! I can't see what's happening. This happened right through the entire movie. It's as if the director of the movie was saying, ""Listen guys, I don't have time to waste on making these shots look good, lets just throw them in so fast that no one can see how bad they are.""Also, there were many occasions where I just wanted to stop watching and call it a day.Going into this movie, I expected it to be bad. They should have stopped at Taken 1, which wasn't bad. Taken 2, as horrible as it is, is still marginally bearable to watch, but this was just terrible.I just feel sorry for Liam Neeson to throw away his reputation with titles like this.Furthermore, there were many scenes that was completely unrealistic. For example:Where in the world will you be able to, first, jump out of the window of a car while the car is barrel rolling down a cliff, secondly, not hurting yourself and thirdly, not being spotted by the enemies.Also, how common is it that inside your garage at home, there is a big hole leading into the sewers ? Is this common, sorry I am not sure, but this is not common in my country.Also, the scene where he looks at the video footage of his ex wife being abducted. first of all, how lucky do you have to be for the camera not only to point exactly at the middle of the crime scene, but is also zoomed in enough without any distortion. Secondly, when the police officers catches him looking at the footage, they shout at him for a while, asking him to step away from the computer. Why the heck didn't they just arrest him immediately, he wasn't holding a weapon, they could have cuffed him immediately, but no, they decided to shout at him for a couple of seconds with their legs being completely frozen. The one officer actually shouted something like, ""I WILL SHOOT YOU !"". Damn, he's just looking at a screen, for crying out loud just cuff him.This one takes the 1st prize. At the end of the movie, he drives a porche into a plane. First of all, this is absurd. If you watch closely, he actually completely tears off the planes landing wheel and socket, forcing the plane to drop down on it's face. A plane's landing wheel and socket, capable of carrying tons of aircraft metal is ripped completely out of it's socket by a porche. Secondly, and this is the best part, the porche receive almost no damage from this. Is the porche made from vibranium ? What the heck ! And last but not least, he crashes a plane that has his daughter in. The entire movie, his objective is to save his daughter. That's right. Let's crash this plane and hope it does not explode.One other thing that made no sense at all. The Russian bad ass who killed his ex wife is some sort of idiot ? We learn later that Stuart was the real master mind and payed this guy to kill his wife and eventually kill Bryan (Liam Neeson), however, when Bryan forces Stuart to phone this guy and tell him that he is bringing his money, why wasn't the Russian guy confused. Why did the Russian guy acted, even after the phone call, as if Stuart owed him the money. Why wasn't he confused when Stuart called him. And further, if that was the case, the Russian guy should have immediately knew something was wrong and packed his lift entrance with body guards. You only learn at the end of the movie that Stuart was the master mind, so before that, it all made sense, but looking back, nothing makes sense !Also, we learn that Stuart sent a text message from Bryan's phone. Bryan, who is paranoid about security and people trying to kill him, does not have a screen lock or pin on his phone !?I don't even know why this movie is called taken or tak3n ?? Because no one is actually taken. His ex wife is murdered and only later, for a mere 5 minutes is his daughter 'taken'. Also, Bryan fails to save is ex- wife. In the previous 2 movies he managed, against all odds to complete his mission with 0 casualties. This time, within the first 10 minutes, his wife is dead. Seems like he is getting old.I also had a problem with the camera hacking image loop in the lift. It was very unrealistic.The reasoning behind Forest Whitaker's belief that Bryan is innocent, is based on bagels ?! Seriously. I am without words.""You know how I know you were innocent? The bagels were still warm. What kind of a person would go out and get warm bagels before they murder their ex-wife?"" I am sure there are many psychopaths and murderers who wouldn't bat an eye.To conclude, this is a terrible action movie with very bad shots and editing. The shots are really fast and unwatchable. The plot and storyline is unrealistic and filled with many loop holes. The script is terrible. Everything was just horrible. I gave this movie 2 stars because Liam Neeson is in it and you hear him say 'bagles'.",Taken 3

However, Taken 3 I find an extremely distracting film. The editing is so shockingly poor that I could barely make out what was going on. 
Each frame is less than 2 seconds long and that carries on throughout the film which made this the least enjoyable of the trilogy. Such a shame.",Taken 3
267,JimBurd,Decent movie ruined by editing,4,30 October 2015,"The plot of this movie is hard-to-believe, at best. But then, this is true of many action films. However, what could have been a pretty decent action movie is completely RUINED by the editing of this film. During the action scenes, most camera shots last two seconds, tops. This makes it almost impossible to follow the action. Instead of understanding what is happening, the viewer is left just staring at the screen as a series of images fly past. At one point, a car plummets down an elevator shaft. The car crashes at the bottom, and our hero starts to get out of the car. How will he get out? We'll never know as the camera cuts away to an aerial scene, and an explosion occurs that takes out the entire elevator shaft. Did he get away? Well, of course he did; this is an action flick, and the hero can't die! But it's left as an exercise for the viewer to figure out how he escaped such a large explosion. Pff ... whatever!I, for one, will be thrilled when this current fad fades, and we can go back to watching much more enjoyable films where the camera can hold a shot for tens of seconds.",Taken 3
268,daniel-music1998,"Taken 3: Packed with action and Liam Neeson, what more could one want?",8,16 January 2015,"Taken 3 was a brilliant thrill ride with solid action scenes and a great storyline. Liam Neeson once again amazed me with his particular set of skills. Sure the first 20 minutes were fairly dull after the beginning sequence and opening credits but Taken 3 delivered on so many levels. Very emotional and very real, a couple of twists and turns here and there with possible ways of making Taken a quadrilogy, although this film moves away from the whole ""Taken"" idea. Lots of fast cuts which made the action difficult to follow but the sequences were prolonged and Taken 3 is much better than its predecessor and equally as good as the first Taken film. Taken 3 was more dramatic and powerful than Taken and Taken 2 with a gripping plot and a surprising ending. Very unexpected but there could be room for another Taken film. Liam Neeson is by far my favourite actor and although 62, still delivers an amazing performance that's believable on-screen. This film is very different to its predecessors and was fantastic to watch. Again, they cut the film down to secure a 12A rating but years ago there would be no way that this would have secured a 12 certificate, it's far too brutal and some of the needed realism like blood spurts were needed, but of course cuts had to be made. A fantastic finale, it may not even be a finale, for me it deserves an 8/10. Thoroughly satisfied, so underrated and delivers in many levels that the first two films didn't.",Taken 3
269,scriff998,"Exciting film, better than the second",8,19 January 2015,"This was a good movie, about as good as the first one, though in a different sense. The 1rst wasn't a huge action film, what made it great was the dark edginess of its premise, its suspense, and glimpsing into the world of sex slavery. This one doesn't so much have those qualities, but it's entertaining as an action film, definitely better than the 2nd. Criticisms? If you nitpick at logic flaws, you might find it hard to believe that, knowing his history, the police would put Neeson in the back of a cop car that has no steel bars or glass separating him from the driver. An otherwise competent fight/shoot-out-with-a-villain scene near the end drew some unintentional giggles from the fact that the villain was in his underwear.

272,LexLodon,"Very Impressed, Good Story, and Average Action",8,9 January 2015,"Liam Neeson has done it again. Quietly, he has become one of the most dominant action stars in Hollywood. This third movie in the Taken series actually deviated from the plot line of the first two movies and also had a few plot twists that made the movie even more interesting. Although we have become used to over dramatized action scenes, Taken 3 has a toned down action sequence with more foot chases, hand-to-hand combat scenes, and also uses quick high-action scenes instead of long drawn-out scenes, that we have become accustomed to seeing quite often. The story was actually quite strong too and Forest Whitaker did an amazing job of adding spice and balance to the overall plot.If you are a fan of the Taken series, I believe that you will like this fresh new-look plot. It was a well-balanced movie that brought back almost all of the characters that we gotten to know over the last two movies.

The third doesn't either. Third dimensional characters are presented in the three main characters, continuing the saga and the love shared between dad, daughter and mother. This is not just an action flick because we have been involved through the continuation of the main characters' lives.

The only high point this film actually managed to reach was an unprecedented level of amateurishness. Making a proper action movie is actually an art in itself, from building tension to camera motion. This movie's idea of conveying an ""immersive experience"" limits itself to taking the spectator through a lobotomizing logorrhea of shots taken from different angles and at different speeds, fed to you in a non-stop shitstorm. The editing feels like it was done by an epileptic iguana. Just remember those psychedelic iguanas in ""Bad Lieutenant"" by Werner Herzog (a very good film, by the way), except that the iguana here is on the wrong drug, psychostimulant instead of hallucinogenic. Like a fair number of its contemporaries, this product resembles more a TV commercial or a video clip than an actual movie. If the two first parts of this trilogy were in fact pretty enjoyable for what they were, this one is better left untouched, as a quick glimpse at the trailer would amply suffice for any spectator willing to spare two hours of his life.",Taken 3

Regularly there are some useless cuts that don't help the story line or action sequence. I don't particularly care for frantic modern-day editing, but when it's done well (eg. Bourne series), then yes, it works. Not here.How, with a 40 Million budget, does it still manage at times to have a cheap cinematography feel to it? Surely you hire top-notch technicians with a budget that size, or is all the budget going into aforementioned paychecks?

That is their job and that is what they are paid for to do. Critic are naysayer psychopathic schizophrenic morons. I really enjoyed this movie from start to finish, it had great story a lots of twists, and that is why I consider it better, then the second installment, that can be close to the first, It has drama, great action, thriller and bone crunching hand combat, followed by great car chases that is longer and better and different to Bourne Ultimatum. The close combat fighting skills are nicely done, as a martial artist practitioner and expert it was remarkable, and realistic, that you can notice hand to hand empty hand vs weapons, lot of shoot out, and everything that you need to make pleasant recipe for an action-thriller movie. People are complaining because the movie is dull slow boring, but to me I could not see were their boredom come from, perhaps concentrating on their stomachs when they will finish their last bite in their popcorn instead on the ride. Anyway it also has nice drama blended with suspense,this time building the character into the story was more emphasized.I was also surprised when Brian Mills mates had more screen this time.In fact their characters are more elevated then to the first and second Taken movies. I say to all action driven martial arts enthusiast go and which it for your self! Don't bite everything on what those sick critics are saying!To them crap movie they will give more credit, then to action-thrillers. Like they did to the crappy Dan Affronsky, Noah, that it didn't make sense to me, that was not even relevant to the scriptures and Bible. To me they don't now nothing about nature and when you come to conflict in real life.However their life is behind desks and computer.They don't seem to understand life threatening events and especially when you have to use close combat fighting skills, against opponents forces, run for your life or kill or be killed. When they do, then they can talk to me.This movie it had a lot of appeal to me, I was was glad that Liam Nesson pulled this off,he was professional, expert, the ending was suspenseful the way it should be. This movie is way better then Unknown and all other Taken hybrids.Taken 3 is crying for a 4th round and I won't reveal here, that can be a corner stone for a sequel.",Taken 3

I was mistaken. Liam Neeson is past his prime and it shows in the police chase senses. He moves slowly and though there is some great camera work to hide this it becomes obvious after a while.The other issue is the change in Stuart, Lenora's new husband. Taken original casted Xander Berkeley for what was a minor role as a rich but sheltered view of life banker. Taken 3 casted Dougray Scott as a seriously bad banker with connections to an ex Russian Spetsnaz killer. I found the over all movie predicable and lacked any suspense from the first. The twist wasn't much of a twist and again it ended in an anti climax. In short, disappointed.",Taken 3

Im sure everyone knows, the Taken film series is huge and whatever happens you'll expect a great film but i was worried about two things... the storyline and the acting of Liam Neeson. Firstly, the storyline... Completely different than Taken 1 and 2 which makes it different but wow. full of twists, excitement and drama. I also think Liam performed perfectly.

You will be disappointed, because unfortunately there is nothing positive that can be said about this movie. I haven't seen a single person who enjoyed this film. Seems that all of the 10/10 reviews here were posted by those who got paid by the studio.The amount of nonsense and stupidity in this movie will insult your intelligence even if you are 5. The story is overcomplicated but at the same time extremely boring, the action sequences were shot and edited by someone who is probably drunk and has epilepsy. On top of that - plot holes are so big, the entire universe can fit in them.Do not waste your time and money on this film. It's not worth even a penny of your money. The first Taken was and still is one of my favorite movies of all time. This though - is probably the biggest disappointment i've seen. I'd rather watch Twilight than this movie again.

By the way, if nobody is taken, then why is it called Taken? Is it because my money was TAKEN by a crappy movie?Bad guys appear in the first 5 minutes and then come back only after the 1 hour mark. That means we got almost 1 hour of pure nonsense.Our hero destroys at least 20 cars, obviously killing innocent people. Nothing happens to him, he's called a hero, he is free to walk away, Such cool guy that Brian Mills!!!This movie is a turd and you should avoid. Ah, it doesn't even have a real conclusion.

There is nothing worse than a scene where your hero is supposed to be beating up bad guys but you don't see anything other than a blurry arm, some guys leg, more blurry stuff, and then our hero wins.Second: thing that really irked me was the way the investigation went. Cops don't assume someone is guilty and then put their entire investigation on hold while they try to bring that person in for questioning. They look at all the evidence and do a thorough investigation. When they saw the video of her being snatched in the van and still refused to try to figure out who the actual killers were I lost interest.

The ridiculous repetitive 'action' passages which depicted an man bordering on elderly as a Bruce Lee on steroids was embarrassing and cringe worthy in the extreme. Taken 1 was new and actually a good warning bell for young ladies heading off but the following rubbish has tainted the memory. If I hear of Taken 4 I'll get Tom Cruise to shoot the lot, there were no redeeming features in this movie whatsoever, from the daft plot to the predictable cartoon like ending. Franck Dotzler letting us know time after time how Bryan Mills was too clever for the cops was a serious misuse of the talented Forest Whitaker.

People keep griping no one gets ""taken"". As Obi Wan Kenobi would say, that's true from a certain point of view. No one is taken as a hostage for extended periods of time. But there is a mystery to be solved, people to be tracked down. I do agree somewhat with the complaints about the action sequences, especially the plane scene. It's implausible that these scenes could happen and no serious injuries happen. But the fighting scenes bring back memories of the original. As far as the fighting/violence not being as graphic or extreme, remember this installment was rated PG-13 so things were toned down. I'm sure if the writers/director felt changes needed to be made they would have.Overall it was enjoyable. Nice work by all involved",Taken 3

Basically if you watch it in context as a standalone film it is a decent action flick but as a sequel to Taken 1 & 2 it is an absolute catastrophe. I have a feeling Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen had to have been fairly conscious of the reboot factor as I don't see how any rational human being could possibly see this working as a sequel to Taken 1 & 2.",Taken 3
302,davejephcott,"Convoluted, tiresome, and wholly dull.",3,3 April 2015,"Why am I subjecting myself to this anymore? If you have seen Taken 2, you know exactly why this rhetorical question is necessary to question my sanity. If you thought Taken 2 could not be beaten in terms of stupidity, laughable dialogue, totally unbelievable (in the literal sense of the word) and ridiculous characters, and yes, unfortunately, forgettable action, then think again! Taken 3 takes it up a notch, gives you even more of the aforementioned features, and gets you to believe that getting pregnant when you're married is no longer a thing to celebrate but to fear. Oh yeah, this movie went there...The title is extremely misleading. It should not have been named Taken 3, as there is no abduction (so it should have been more aptly titled Untaken 3). There are simply a bunch of boring car chases, gun shootouts, and tiresome combat sequences. You have seen it all before in bigger and better movies. If you are familiar with the characters from either the first or second movie, there are no new faces of any consequence this time around. The convoluted and entirely uninspired plot is supposed to be based on Bryan Mills' (Liam Neeson) attempts to find the ones responsible for his wife's murder (which police were made to believe he perpetrated), yet somehow the movie has more to do with his countless run-ins with the police - who I must say are the worst set of law enforcers I have ever seen on film - and the ensuing chase sequences, and, of course, as always, Mills ends up escaping them. There is one such altercation that occurs in the movie which only happens because Mills wanted to meet his daughter, tell her he loved her, and to repeat the same words he had mentioned to her earlier in the movie. Thud! This movie might not have you glued to your screens on account of its heart-pounding action, but it just might get you rolling on the floor laughing at its hysterical storyline - if you are into that sort of thing.It is all too apparent that Liam Neeson has had enough with this franchise. It must be a huge relief to him to know that the producers will not be extending another invitation to him for Taken 4, as this was a box office bomb. Along with the wishes of audiences worldwide, he must be hoping to soon find greener pastures and not let this debacle be the end of his reign as the supreme Hollywood action star of the last five or so years. For all my love of this guy, I am beginning to think it might be better for him to seek different roles other than action figures, as many have started to tire of seeing him on screen as a fighting man. I would love to see him do more in the lines of Schindler's List. He has some seriously good acting chops, and he should not squander them on the likes of Taken 3. There is nothing else left to say about Untaken 3. Do give it a miss, regardless of whether or not you are an action movie fan. If you are able to find even a smidgen of entertainment from this contraption then I envy you. I would not be surprised if you could watch a movie about snails crawling and somehow be entertained.

Addition of Forest Whitaker was good n he did a fine job.Every actor did a fine job but wish some characters would have been better written.IMO They should end the trilogy here unless they can work some magic.IF you are a fan of Neeson or Action flicks you might like it.

304,jesse-reinhard,A Lazy Conclusion to the Series,2,29 January 2015,"To sum it up in one word, it is lazy. The story/plot are just plane predictable and cheesy. It's unbelievable how many massive explosions he escapes without a scratch (at least two).Bryan Mills's ex-wife is murder and he must solve the case while avoiding the police. In the end he may prove he's innocent, but how can they just let him walk out of the police station with all the other crimes he committed? Including: evading/escaping police custody, loads of property damage, nearly killing a ton of people on the highway, and actually killing all those Russian mobsters at the end. Sure he did pretty much the same stuff in the previous movies, but it all happened in another country. We can believe the ending where he flies back home to his normal life without repercussions.But the whole plot falls apart when you find out Lenny's new husband is the bad guy (which you can see from a mile away). Think back to the first movie and Lenny's second husband. If you remember Bryan says he did a background check on the second husband (which was how he knew about his private jet and got to Paris, if you've forgotten). So how can Bryan let Lenny marry this new guy without doing a background check on him as well? How could not know about the arms dealing with Russian mobsters? Not know about him losing all his money or the life insurance policy on Lenny? Bryan should have known this stuff from the get-go, and none of the events of this movie should have happened.",Taken 3

Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) lets people know that he's not ready to step out of action movie scene just quite yet. the film has its campy . boring. dark. & sad moments which makes for an overall good 3rd installment in this series. there are a few scenes that don't make any sense at all i didn't see the first two taken films. but in all honesty this film dominates both of those in a heartbeat and beats any cash they may have raked in. the midway point of the film reminds me a little of lethal weapon 4. sum of all fears and along came a spider. its not a great film. but its not horrible either overall a good film with lots of action. you almost feel a sense of clinging to some of the non important characters more than the main characters. i'd rather watch this at the box office instead of American sniper.,Taken 3
306,james-gomez760,Starring Liam Neesen (What else did you expect?),5,17 May 2015,"Only Liam Neesen can do the unimaginable.Okay so spoiler yes typical Liam movie where he's a complete bad-ass and nothing can stop him no matter how many people are after him. Old plot right? But for some reason we continue to watch his movies because something draws us into them.Great story line bad guys always lose typical movie. The fact that Liam does the unthinkable for any human does get a little old, but doesn't he in every movie? The fact he does thinks from the beginning of the movie that are nearly impossible to do makes the movie seem so much more fictional. Quick run down Liam's wife is killed he is set up he runs from the cops the entire movie more than he does actually chase the bad guys finally catches up to the bad guys kills all of them except one and says he will be back for him.. which leaves us to believe we will be forced to watch a Taken 4 in the future. Pros despite the fact this movie and Liam does so many things that are beyond possible for any man to do the movie has a lot of action and since we all watched the previous Taken movies something draws us into this once. Movie starts off fast paced despite the (lack of appreciate his family shows him) in all the movies considering he saved their lives how many times already? The movie is something that will somehow keep you interested.Downfalls are the stuff he does as we all know so ridiculous it's not even close to believable that any man can do (retired spec ops or not). Also in the back of our mind we know that Liam is the only man on earth who can beat up cops, destroy cars and shoot at anyways while running from the cops without getting arrested is just so ridiculous. The fact that he doesn't kill who was behind this entire disaster of his wife's death is pointless. All for a set up of I will find you leaves us a good hint we will see Taken 4 and hopefully that will be the last of this movie franchise. Overall 5 out 10 a lot of complete fictional action, but a typical Liam Neesen movie if you got to kill 2 hours this will definitely do the trick.Hope this review helped!",Taken 3

Seemed like a movie made by idiots for idiots. Anyone who is mildly intelligent will find it laughable.Where do I start, the way this film was shot was poor at best, no scene lasted longer the 3 minutes to try and achieve the same relentless pace we enjoyed from the first Taken movie. This was even worse during any action sequence where there would be about 20 different shots in a space of 30 seconds showing pretty much the same event from pointless angles. The dialogue, so cheesy, they put in every cliché line from any action movie you can think of, one dimensional characters sounding like idiots. There was a moment in this film where Mills plugs in a USB into a LAPD computer and the computers voices says ""You are currently accessing the LAPD hidden files"" just in case people in the cinema missed this. This movie treats its audience like they are slow, and I feel you actually have to be to enjoy it for what it is.

315,dylanreh,A Forced Sequel that is Easily Forgettable,3,28 July 2015,"Out of the 300 titles I have rated on IMDb, Taken 3 is the only one I have rated below a 3/10, and is currently my lowest rated movie on the site. There are several reasons why.Just to be clear, I didn't go in expecting much, but what I got was still extremely disappointing, especially after the awesome original Taken (a great action movie with a fresh feel to it - a movie I've seen half a dozen times).Not only did Taken 3 feel like an extremely forced cash-grab sequel to a successful predecessor, but the plot itself was only vaguely believable. The main character's daughter is taken in the first movie, then him and his ex-wife in the second movie to raise the stakes. This scenario is already a bit far fetched. But to then have that same man framed for the murder of the ex-wife he just got finished saving? I understand the need to have an evolving plot between movies in the series, but all in all this one still felt very forced. But even if you can suspend your disbelief at this one man's terrible luck and over- the-top family issues, there is still little enjoyment to be found in Taken 3. Much of the film's dialogue was utterly forgettable, and several entire scenes felt like complete filler (one early scene in particular that involved a large teddy bear comes to mind). The action itself wasn't necessarily bad, but it wasn't by any means good either. Taken 3 delivers some repetitive quick-cut action scenes that we've seen a million times before in a million different movies, and brings absolutely nothing new to the table. However, it's not the forced feel, the far-fetched plot,the knowledge that the movie itself is likely just a Hollywood cash-grab, or the uninteresting action scenes that are Taken 3's biggest downfall, it is just how incredibly forgettable the movie as a whole is. Even just a few days after watching the movie (and paying attention to it, of course) I found myself trying to piece together what exactly the movie was about and how it had been portrayed, and was genuinely surprised to find that I could only vaguely remember what entire scenes had been about, and how the movie as a whole had progressed. At present time, I don't even recall who the ""bad guy"" of the movie was, or if there was one at all, other than the police. And it's a shame too, because the franchise had started off so well with the first Taken.To summarize: Taken 3 is one of the most forgettable Hollywood cash-grabs I've ever seen (and I've watch A Good Day to Die Hard, mind you), with tons of mindless action and pointless dialogue that ultimately does nothing more than insult the intelligence of the viewer.",Taken 3

The only differences from the previous franchises are a plot twist and the fact that nobody gets taken (which makes me think why this movie is called Taken?).As usual, Liam Neeson performs his best to portray Bryan Mills who is both a badass character and a loving father. His action scenes are superb as he skillfully eluded the police and single-handedly took down the entire bodyguards (well, he did get help but he is the one who killed the entire guards, even the boss has to get half- naked to fight him...). The rest of the casts also did well to portray their characters, but it is a pity that we cannot get more scenes with the antagonist Oleg Malankov (Sam Spruell) to get more informations about the character.The story is pretty smooth and intense as it gradually reaches the climax. To distinguish this movie from the rest of the franchises, Taken 3 includes a plot twist near the end of the climax, which is pretty effective even though it is a cliché that can be seen from other action movies. The only bad thing from this plot twist is the anti-climatic (almost comical) scene when the real antagonist took Kim as a hostage (well.. I guess this movie is still a Taken...). Overall, it is still a pretty enjoyable movie, but not the best of the entire franchise",Taken 3

333,uryon-adams,Pffh... more like a horrible take on The Fugitive.,3,20 April 2015,"The movie is as fully cliché as any movie can get. I'm not talking about the cheesy plot, the horrible over-emphasized score that accompanies this piece of trash that shouldn't have been made, or the shaky camera shots throughout half the action scenes. I'm talking about everything, every little piece of what happens is cliché, predictable, and unoriginal. You would just not have to be a fan of normal action-thriller movies in general to not be able to predict what'll happen here. The whole thing where he stays just one step ahead of the almighty Forest Whittaker's head detective character, is literally just emulation of The Fugitive at its finest. The whole thing where Liam Neeson is basically God, because he can never die, which I'm not surprised at, is at an all-time high on here that just looks plain silly. I swear a bad guy can't not miss, then the fight scene at the end just proves it. The biggest, baddest, boss-ass bad guy, who's comically, and rightfully so, in his briefs during the scene, misses every time with a machine gun. Also hard to take him seriously since he looks so much like Jim Carey's character from Dumb and Dumber, which has probably been said before many times here in the review section.As for the acting... not too bad. Not too bad at all. Everyone who acted in this movie, this... utter disgrace to all the other Taken movies, could've had better roles than this in anything else. I'd bet my ass this was all for the money, which I can totally see. I found Forest Whitaker's character to be corny at its finest; he talks the same in every movie, and sometimes it works out, sometimes it bombs. Him as a head detective? Hiroshima.The script... I don't even wanna get into that. Obviously, the people who wrote the script just decided to stick to everything concrete that happens in an action movie. ""Fuck being abstract. Let's just follow the predictable path and go from there.""Seriously, save your money. Cherish the other Taken movies as if they were diamonds, because this one parodies the seriousness the other two tried to provide so well. Liam Neeson's character fell off, and naturally so, on this low-budget bullshit that I honestly wish was never made, and I was never made to go see.",Taken 3

It still has good shooting & fighting, but that's it, no more. Or maybe you are Liam Neeson fanboy/fangirl, then you should watch this 3 times in theater. I wonder.. is it because Liam has lost his touch or the script writer lost his way. Or maybe his life is so boring that you have taken 3 times (or more?? noooo..). Or maybe it's time for Liam to join Expandables team.I gave it 2 stars because it will be too cruel for Liam to get 1 star & for the sakes of Taken.

If you are a fan of this franchise you can watch or wait for DVD. Very Disappointed. Action sequences, considered to be the strength of Taken franchise. Don't get your hopes high this time because the film fails to deliver there as well. Close shots and jerky movements of a hand-held camera fail to create any momentum; all that cracking of skulls can give you nausea though. In Taken (2008), Bryan Mills tells the kidnappers on the phone what exactly he will do and what the kidnappers are up against, to which they reply saying, ""Good luck"".

It was a straight up action movie and for the most part it was a good film. Taken 2 however was a f*cking mess, it was probably the worst film Liam Neeson has done throughout his entire career and then this turd comes out of the works.First off, the film has a horrible cast. Liam Neeson is alright but all of the supporting roles are terrible. The story ends up being predictable and pretty boring for the most part. The action is alright but considering its going against the very good John Wick this film, the action was disappointing.Overall, if you like Taken 2 you will probably like it but if you hated Taken 2 you will feel like killing yourself after watching this mess of a film.",Taken 3

The plot of the film is fairly interesting, the action scenes were appropriate, even though I wanted to see Neeson using more gadgets and more of his fist fights. The twist and reveal is effective - but the film isn't what the original Taken was. Definitely better than the second one, but worse than the first one - which is the pattern which most films catch.In terms of the cast, I must clap my hands for Forest Whitaker. I genuinely enjoyed watching him, he played his role brilliantly and proper engaged to it.

It's a really good film, it's got the action and twists of what I think makes a great storyline for this franchise! and as the trivia states the Russian criminals in this film are mentioned in the first one when Bryan is talking to Stuart about his known enemies so it ties up their involvement in a tidy little bow! Also I really enjoyed Forest Whitaker's portrayal of inspector Franck Dotzler, the role suited him perfectly, there were some parts of the film where I thought he may even outsmart Bryan!!

That's less than a second per shot in an action scene. You are unable to see what is happening to who and when. It's poorly told action scenes are a real disappointment, after all what do you watch a Taken movie for! Perhaps I should have expected less, but I like to think Liam Neeson can do better.

I'd guessed the plot 33 minutes into the film which lead to much disappointment as the film reached its climax! Liam Neeson was fantastic! A truly fantastic actor, though - that is, afterall, to be expected as this genre is very much his comfort zone. I try not to judge films unfairly.

The moment I heard Taken 3 was coming to cinemas, I knew it was going to be the same formula again, watered down and made less believable. Well, I was actually surprised - they skewed the formula a fair bit to the point where the whole thing was misguided, unrealistic and actually consistently laughable. I gave the thing a 3 because it's an action movie, and it has Liam Neeson. It's going to be entertaining and to be fair I didn't fall asleep or get restless in my seat. It was a fun movie and it had some cool moments. There were a few hints of the smart CIA tactics that distinguishes the series and Bryan Mills, but they were generally far fetched, too convenient and too obviously set up by the writer.Thankfully the original Taken movie stands alone, and as far as I am concerned they could write a hundred Taken movies but it will never spoil the original.",Taken 3

But instead he goes all arrogant I will do this all myself cause I Am much better at this then you are. And along the way Mr. Mills got I think at least 30 innocent people hurt or even killed.He pushes policemen out of vehicles, crashes cars, drives around reckless...

Apart from Liam Neeson, this movie is just any old action film. Dirty Harry is a good movie, but that is no excuse to be unoriginal.Now in comparison to the other two Takens, it comes no where near the first. The first was original and had quite a good story line.

Taken 3 has loss the exhilarating effect and when the bad guys die, you no longer get the ""vengeance fulfilled"" feeling. In fact, you felt kinda sorry for the villains. In the previous Takens, you felt... ""serves you right!"". You can also see that Liam Neeson's age shows. even the way he runs looks like an old man's run.

Somehow the writer didn't put more effort to make the movie more complicated and just copied from any old action movies. Another thing that made this movie awkward is either all of the police officers are dumb or Bryan Mills is too smart for them. Only a police investigator that at least can read Bryan Mills' actions. Still, he is always short by one-step from Bryan Mills. The Russian gangsters are also too easy to be defeated by Bryan Mills alone. Reminding me to Rambo or Die Hard. The gangster leader despite as ex-Spetsnaz force, is quite reckless. He shoot a machine gun without covering himself. If he wait patiently and shoot properly Bryan Mills would be dead. And, this movie should not be titled as Taken, because the taken was happened in the last 15 minutes only.Purpose As the story is quite predictable this movie wasn't so thrilling anymore. Only some actions by Bryan Mills in hand-to-hand combat with the Russian gangster gave me a thrill.Acting Most of the acting were acceptable, the fighting scene by Liam Neeson is as good as usual.

Also this shooting thing with shaking camera style is bad. The movie is attractive because of the actor's name. But after watching it you realize that it is a waste of time. Liam Neeson had good movies in his carrier as a actor like Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, Non-Stop, The Grey, Kinsey, A-Team or Unknown. but this one is not one of these action movies. I think the director also didn't do a well job - i don't know maybe because of the budget. But 48 million dollars are enough for that kind of movies. So the last thing to say: The movie crew (except the actors) screwed it up.",Taken 3
364,chrispower84-806-234357,Cracking Return,9,8 January 2015,Having watched the latest Taken film last night I thought I would write a review as I have read mixed reviews in the lead up to its release. Lets be honest its very rare that the 3rd film in a franchise is ever as good or better than the first and that is probably the case here. Having said that Taken 3 is a very enjoyable film with a decent plot/storyline. While we all now know what to expect from Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) it is the performance of the head cop (Forest Whitaker) that adds something to the film that was maybe lacking in Taken 2. Overall if you like the previous Taken films you'll love this one just as much!!!,Taken 3
365,me-849-27730,Quite frankly a poor effort at the last series of what was one of the most powerful revenge movies made,2,8 January 2015,"I was very disappointed at the story line. Expecting to see the final showdown between the ex CIA operative and a ruthless group of criminals from eastern Europe who had every reason to attempt a third time to destroy him and his wife and daughter.But instead all i saw was a pathetic attempt at a change in plot as if we were watching another movie altogether.The acting in some scenes was shallow and the film was very predicable after you had realized what the main plot was.Forest Whittaker's character as the clever detective came across as a bit too clever with some shallow one liners and lack of character development considering the plot completely changed for the film any way. It was the least they could do!I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say this but i really wish they had stuck to the 1st and second films story line and introduced the same family as a grand finale for the film.After all the movies title was Taken 3 ""It Ends Here""But yet It Ends Here appeared to begin here?.The amazing thing about the 1st and 2nd films was the scenes/location and backdrops and the storyline keeping you entwined in what would happen next. This move felt dull and very formula film like with a quite predictable action film feel to it.I would have been happy with taken 2 as the final film.",Taken 3

I even gave Taken 2 credit for being a good way to reapproach the original idea and still get a good action movie. That being said, this movie was terrible. At the end of Taken 2, I and everyone else who I've talked to were under the impression that his wife was back with him. So why is Stuart back? Oh to be the worst bad guy in the history of bad guys. I am more moved to fright by the germs in the Mucinex commercials. All I see out of him is douchebag with lots of money. On top of that, explosions for no reason, two car chases where the editing is so choppy as to induce an epileptic seizure. The cops are so hapless, they should be in a comic book. Forrest Whitaker's character ""knew from the beginning"" that Brian Mills is innocent of murdering his wife, but chased him anyway, finding some of the dead bodies Liam Neeson leaves in his wake. A slit throat early in the film leaves 3 drops of blood, a suicide by headshot leaves a corpse that could interview for a job in 20 minutes, and the ""main"" bad guy gets two body shots from close range, but upon further inspection, those mortal wounds look like ten year old gunshot scars. It wasn't even laughable. I felt betrayed and robbed by what was clearly just a sequel being made because it made financial sense to do it.",Taken 3
367,seblani45,review,10,24 February 2015,"I Recently saw taken 3, and it was a classic. The movie picks back up were it left off at. The main character is Bryan Mills a retired CIA operative with a set of skills that leaves his victims in pain. Now Mills is closer to his family more than ever. His daughter Kim is in college and has a boyfriend. She is also about to have a child. Meanwhile, Mills former wife Lenore is going through another tough marriage which is stressing her out.This event, leads to her death. This is now were Bryan Comes home to his house and finds her dead in his room. Lenore earlier sent a text message to Bryan. Saying she was coming over and asked if he could pick up some bagels. Now Bryan is accused of a murder that he never committed. So through out the movie Bryan sets out to find the real true killer and clear his name. The cops then come charging into the bed room to arrest Mills but, he's not having it. Mills refuses to be arrested he attacks the cops and hops out of the window.Also in the mix is Stuart who is Lenore's husband. He has a mysterious background to him. Mills is able to find the true Killer with the help of his friends and his daughter. The killer turns out to be one of Stuart old partners. Stuart owns him money and the only way to get Stuart's attention was to kill his wife. However this is where it gets sneaky at. For Stuart to pay off his debt he knew there was 12 million dollar life insurance on his wife. So he setup the killing and framed Bryan. Being the smart man Mills is he was able to find out the true killer and put an end to Stuart. So, basically the whole movie is non stop action there is fist fights, shootouts, and highway chases. For me this is my type of movie. I gave this movie at 7 out of 10 because it is a downgrade from the previous two. I would recommend this movie to anybody who is a fan of action packed movies. I would refer anybody who is new to Taken movies to watch the first two Taken movies to get a better understanding of it.",Taken 3

During the movie the tension is building up. At last you'll realize that if he kills one of the two 'bad guys', he'll give an advantage to the other.

Let Me tell you they're are a few vague scenes but the movie with a good cast has turned out to be fine totally opposite as too what the critics are telling us.

I do not believe that 90 year old man can do anything that was portrayed in the movie. The fact that they spent so much time focusing on a stupid bagel was idiotic. There was so much time wasted in the movie of him speaking to his daughter for no reason or him going to see his ex wife. These can all be cut out the movie and the time could be better spent coming up with a better plot. He catches up to airplanes and hits his car 1000 times with no damage and not a single scratch.

Which if they didn't they shouldn't have watched the movie.Taken is one of the best movies I have seen lately. Plus it says in the news that Taken 3 has beaten The Hobbit by 2/3 in the box office. It can't be that bad if it is better than The Hobbit. I don't love The Hobbit, but they aren't awful movies. There are tons of Hobbit fans. If they really liked Hobbit better, than they would have gone to The Hobbit, not Taken 3.Maybe it is just my opinion, but Taken 3 is just as good as Taken 1 & 2. Also, critics are saying it has nothing to do with the title. Well that is a stupid critic. You say it doesn't comply with the title Taken, so are you saying you would rather have it comply with the title Taken and be seriously boring?Personally, I am happy they found a way to bring a twist to the movie and manage to keep my interest the whole time.I was not expecting it to be that good, and it totally proved me wrong.If you are a fan of the Taken movies, please stop listening to the negative reviews.

384,blueparadiserentals,Taken 3 Takes Away the Meaning of the Series,1,7 February 2015,"SPOILER ALERT: I seldom write reviews, but I just got home from watching Taken 3, and felt compelled. As a huge Liam Neesom fan and lover of the Taken series, I was completely and utterly disappointed in this sequence. Actually, I wanted to leave the theater after viewing the first 30 minutes. What was so utterly disappointing is that the writers wrote this 3rd installment without fully understanding what Taken moviegoers love. The relationship which was forming between this family, particularly that of Brian and Lenore, was an important one, and one that compelled people to ""tap"" back into the series. So, when SPOILER ALERT: Lenore is killed within the first half hour of the film (literally she has one short speaking scene and the next time you see her she is dead), you have to wonder--""What the hell"". This was just a ridiculous plot twist that killed the series for me and others. It was ludicrous and unnecessary.So...lets reflect....the second movie deals with Brian saving Lenore and building the audience to believe they will get back together. And..the third movie kills her. Ah...good spin off.???? Ridiculous. Not only did the third installment, in my view, kill the series for me, I will never be able to go back and enjoy Taken 1 and Taken 2 as I used to. What careless and ridiculous writing. Further, they never fully explained the motivation to kill Lenore. They tried to connect it to money, but Suart never intended to give the villain in the story the money, so none of it made sense. Also, Dougray Scott plays Stuart. Again...hurting the 3rd film. In the first film, Stuart is played by a 50-something aged actor that looked like a guy who spent more time with donuts than guns. Yet, in Taken 3, he's a physical, good looking guy toting a gun (at the end). Just an illogical leap for this character. Whoever wrote this series should never be allowed to destroy another hit series again. I wish I could get my money back for the ticket. I hated it.",Taken 3

The movie could have been better, specially in the script which lacks in creativity or more exciting events.

387,lucidthinking,Action for actions sake,2,6 March 2015,"I felt compelled to write a review considering that it's viewer rating is respectable.I didn't feel the need to watch this film considering the last incarnation. But after reading some of the reviews I thought that I'd give it a go.First off, when taking time out to watch a film, I expect to be challenged emotionally and or morally. Ultimately I hope to be immersed in a package that's both entertaining and leaves me wanting for more. And once the credits are rolling, if the viewer is left questioning scenarios and possible conclusions, all the better. Actually, better still are films that have you questioning said scenarios and conclusions days or even weeks later.The original Taken was dark, gritty and clever. The cast, locations, script, acting and action all made sense and made for a pretty solid proposition. As a viewer, you were introduced to what to expect, and the journey made sense without having to spell out every detail. You could feel a relative connection with the lead character and his justifiable desire to seek vengeance and ultimately protect his family. All in all it was tidy and left you thinking.Taken 3 is one of those films where you can leave your brain at the door before you sit down to endure it. It actually takes you by the hand and walks you through and explains the what's and why's of each characters thought process. There are no puzzles nor curve balls. The ingenuity and passion of the lead character has been diluted to the point where it no longer exists. The tech which was utilised to provide the missing puzzle pieces was just beyond ridiculous. They might as well of had labels hanging off of each one with a brief description of their purpose. I wouldn't have been surprised at all if the guns used had ""GUN"" printed on the sides in bold white letters. At it's core, the story and script are garbage. The supposed heart felt moments were unconvincing and cringingly obvious, this can also be said for the conclusion. The story felt rushed and incohesive. The emotional journey didn't flow and failed to connect. The character building lacked subtlety to the point of making it glaringly obvious who the script writers and director wanted to label as the good guys and the bad guys. And the action, and camera work therein, was just nonsense. Taken 3 is a prime example of film producers piggy backing off the success of the original title to cash in, and to hell with the quality of finish. If you want a basic film that upturns ALL stones and leaves you without doubt, this one's for you. If, however, you're like me and hope to be both challenged and entertained, give this one the body swerve. It seriously isn't worth the time",Taken 3

394,jackbjnorman,This is a complaint,1,6 December 2015,"I am angry at the laziness of the film, how as expected the film is set up so that no matter what Liam Neeson can beat the police (all my of them), the mafia hell even actual physics can't stop him. The sheer stupidity of the logic behind some of the scenes for example the head detective for the LAPD eats some of the evidence at a murder crime scene without,a care: 'these bagels that have been left out look too delicious to use as evidence that we could use in court.' Another example: Liam Neeson uses CCTV to zoom into someone's hand in a moving vehicle in great detail as if from a professional camera, there was the usual 'even though they got into the mafia by being great killers, can't hit Liam Neeson even with greater numbers and better weaponry. If there were negative ratings for how bad this film was I would give it a -1 but until then, it gets a generous 1 star out of 10 the only other film I have given that rating was Antony Hopkins' 'A Good Marriage'....",Taken 3
395,jacobasimpson,Montage of thoughtless violence,3,2 December 2015,"This movie certainly cannot compare to the clever and crafty violent solutions to problems encountered by the protagonist in Taken but it isn't all bad. Much of the violence is senseless and sadly lacking the wit employed by Bryan Mills in the first movie, but a bunch of men getting smacked around by Liam Neeson is still entertaining...to some degree. There is at least a suspense as to who the bad guy really is which is good and bad. On one hand you don't know who the mastermind is that is causing the main conflict, on the other hand its hard to figure out exactly why Liam Neeson is beating some guy up. Now if one pays attention to the police chief they will notice he has an odd habit of playing with a rubber band, this is a motif that the careful viewer will notice up to the very end of the movie.",Taken 3
396,florianleray,"Good movie, didn't see time go by",8,9 January 2016,"Good movie. Wouldn't expect that from Megaton and Besson, but I must admit I didn't get bored during 1h40 (that's the length of the movie, just don't think it's just 1/3 of it). Action, same usual play (that I like) from L Neeson...Though it's kind of similar to previous Takens, I'd bet if you'd liked the first twos, you'll like this one. OK, it's not as surprising as the first one, but honestly it's just the same old good game. I would have strengthened the bad guy's story, but apart from that I got to think about the Fugitive, with hell of a F.Whitaker acting like hell of a T.Lee Jones (not as good though, Besson needed time to show stunts everywhere and forgot about Whitaker's inside thoughts). Anyway, good game Megaton and Besson, keep going, will be keen on watching the 4th.",Taken 3
397,pryschkad,Taken 3 Review,6,8 November 2016,"Oliver Megaton is back for the third time with Liam Neeson and Maggie Grace as the main protagonists. Despite the range of famous faces that have nothing to prove anymore in Hollywood and some flawless special effects, Taken III never really impresses or surprises us at all. That being said, it is a good movie in its own category that I would recommend. Of course, it doesn't have a meaningful plot, none of the actors really gives an outstanding performance and the movie doesn't answer to any existential questions, but it does the job for me anyway. If you want to enjoy an average action movie, go ahead because this is exactly what this movie gives you: *SPOILER ALERT? Not really* The hero wants blood for the death of his beloved one, he finds out who is the bad guy and then put him six feet under after a series of delightful fight scenes. In addition, if you put aside the poor story line, everything else is on point. The cast is far from disappointing even if there is no real surprise as this is already the third movie of the franchise and the villain is still a huge cliché but who cares? Every scene is shot in familiar and realistic environments like it could have happened next door and the music choices help you to get into the film. In the end, Taken III is an average entertaining ACTION movie; the word speaks for itself ☺",Taken 3
398,Joy_Johaana_Hamilton,Ten Stars,10,5 May 2017,"Beautifully shot and amazingly mind stimulating. Never a dull moment. This movie touches on a subject many are afraid to talk about. A topic that should be at top of the list of importance not only in America, but, unfortunately everywhere. Doesn't hide behind smoke screens, yet, has the effect of exposing the truth without having to guide you to it. Taken is a movie that everyone should see with an open eye.",Taken 3
399,hayleyc-95942,I got whiplash,2,13 August 2019,"Don't bother with this. The editing is TERRIBLE, really terrible. There are about 100 cuts per second in the action sequences which made me feel like I was in a washing machine.
Oh and the story is bad too
So yeah pass on this",Taken 3
400,jimpartridge,Better than given credit for,8,21 May 2017,"OK, so I've read many of the reviews of this movie and wanted to put my view forward, as I feel it has taken (no pun intended) something of a bashing ! Basically, I found it to be a good, enjoyable action movie – so there were no Albanians, and no-one was taken – so what ??? Why are people so hung up on these points ? The return of most of the original characters was a big plus, a familiarity, and a new plot which was plausible, lots of action and Neeson doing what he does best, with the involvement and interaction of his special group. As for a poor sequel – go back through 50 years of the industry – what sequels are even as good as the original – Jaws, Star Wars, Rocky, First Blood, Die Hard to name but a few. Yet I still think we are left with an entertaining action movie, and if you are prepared to sit back and enjoy the fantasy, as all movies are, rather than sit there with a pen and paper trying to find any holes and irregularities, that you could find with any movie, then this is what it is all about. Maybe not a typical Taken movie in the same sense that the first 2 were, but none-the-less, entertainment, action, and for me, it hit the right note.",Taken 3
401,philippsienkiewicz,The worst movie I have every seen,2,22 February 2018,"Although I've watched ""Did You Hear About the Morgans"" and ""The Room"", Taken 3 is the upmost worst movie I've ever seen. Worst of all, I paid for it.
I am not really sure, but I think it had to be a PG13 screening. There was no blood whatsoever. First scene - someone gets knive slaughtered in the bedroom. Sheets clean, floor clean, even the freaking knive was clean as like it just came out of the dishwasher. This no-blood-technique goes on. People die during that movie out of nothing, they just seem to fall asleep or jump against walls and then fall asleep.
There was one hilariously stupid scene, in which the main character looked at his 1980'-like cell phone to see a map with GPS coordinates on where his daughter is right now. Wow. Wow. This was so up-to-date. If 1977's Star Wars wanted to be as up-to-date as Taken 3, the space ships would had been built of wood. Graphics and movement remind me of the 1980's Pac-man game.
I know this is a movie, but Liam Neeson seemed to be god-like and kind of supernatural - waaay too much in my opinion.
I really enjoyed Taken I. Taken II was a waste of time, but Taken III - just don't watch it, don't pay for it, don't buy dvds, blurays, don't waste your time.BTW If you are a fan of Family Guy, you should watch this Taken spoof episode - Family Guy - Leggo My Meg-O 2012.",Taken 3
