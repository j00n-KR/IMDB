0,MartinHafer,beautiful but DULL,2,29 January 2006,"I guess I just wasn't cut out to watch Visconti films. Previously I watched The Leopard and found it to be very ponderous and about twice as long as it should be. Now, with Death in Venice, I found the same overblown and dull atmosphere all over again. The sets are gorgeous and the costumes are first-rate BUT if the film itself is dull and desperately in need of editing, you'll lose most of the viewers. My bet is that all the positive reviews are from people with a much higher than normal tolerance for this sort of fare. But, the average person will be feeling suicidal after just a few minutes of this tedium. For example, like The Leopard (which I also found to be overlong and ponderous), there is a dinner sequence that looks as if they just started filming it from beginning to end even though NOTHING of consequence occurred. Yes, you could have shown Dirk Bogarde's becoming infatuated with the young man in 1 or 2 minutes--not by long shots of him staring across the room for a seeming eternity. DULL, DULL, DULL!!! Now before you completely dismiss my negative review, understand that I like long movies provided the plot justifies it and the pacing is maintained. Films like ""Ben Hur"", ""Chariots of Fire"" and ""Gone With the Wind"" are great films and deserve to have tremendous scope and last a lot longer than 90 minutes. Heck, Sergey Bondarchuk's ""War and Peace"" STILL is a wonderful film and it's over seven hours long!! At 131 minutes, Death in Venice, however, seemed to last even longer---even 90 minutes would have been too long! What matters is the pacing--not the running time.UPDATE: Since seeing ""Death in Venice"", I have watched quite a few more Visconti films and realize I do like most of his films. Some are also slow paced and long (such as ""Rocco and Hist Brothers"") but are MUCH more interesting and entertaining than ""Death in Venice"".",Death in Venice
1,bkoganbing,A natural masterpiece,9,19 April 2012,"Lucchino Visconti and Dirk Bogarde achieved screen immortality with a partnership that only consisted of two films, The Damned and Death In Venice. But with these two I think the artists said all there was and couldn't do better.This is such a delicate subject because what we're talking about is both stalking and possibly pedophilia. On this side of the pond yes, in Europe with lower ages of consent probably not. Bjorn Andressen's character is hanging on the legal line. Andressen himself was 16 when he made Death In Venice and looks like 12.The thing that bowls me over about Death In Venice besides the performances is the great eye for detail that Visconti had in creating the Italian scene before World War I. The one Oscar nomination Death In Venice did receive is for Costume Design. It should have been given a few more.Based on the character of Gustav Mahler whose music is used as the soundtrack, Dirk Bogarde plays a middle aged German composer who feels a sense of impending mortality as we all start to do reaching his age. He might have another masterpiece in him and beautiful surroundings might bring it out. Venice is for him the ideal beautiful spot. In America I feel that way about San Diego having been there just once.But anything Bogarde might write is nothing compared to the beauty he sees on a beach when he spots young Tadzio played by Bjorn Andresen accompanied by mother Silvana Mangano who is on holiday. Even in a much looser society there are still conventions and Bogarde is struck dumb. He dare not even approach the kid. Andresen is a masterpiece created by his parents and God.Even with disease and pestilence approaching Venice as the place for all its beauty has the most polluted water this side of Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. Warned to get out Bogarde can't abandon sight of Andresen. The result is fatal for him.Both when I was younger and even older there are certain people who have absolutely totally struck me mute with sight of their physical beauty. Some I've done something with, others for reasons of legality and convention I never did. There's a scene in Citizen Kane where an elderly Everett Sloane describes a young girl with a parasol whom he saw in passing on a crowded street and never saw again. That was his Tadzio moment.I had something similar seeing a young man of about Tadzio's age in the late Seventies on Avenue K and Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn. I remember his wavy blond hair and absolutely stunning looks to this day even though we passed on the street and didn't exchange a word. I can truly identify with what Bogarde felt although I kept my hormones in better check than he did.Poor Bogarde he should have left Venice and dedicated a concerto to Andresen. But his performance is in itself a kind of concerto and with a minimum of dialog and some incredible facial expressions. They don't call it expressionism for nothing.And with the Stonewall Rebellion barely two years old this was quite a daring subject for Visconti and Bogarde, a pair of gay men to do for the cinema. Visconti never hid his sexual orientation, but Bogarde was a very private man by nature and that he was in a committed relationship for years was something no one then knew about. He was after all a British matinée idol from the Fifties who broke through and became a respected actor.Death In Venice, book by Thomas Mann, filmed by Lucchino Visconti and brought wonderfully alive on the screen by Dirk Bogarde is still beautiful and evocative. Don't miss it if broadcast.",Death in Venice
2,SnoopyStyle,Italian art-house,7,17 June 2017,Composer Gustave Aschenbach is sick with stress. He goes to a seaside resort only to obsess about a beautiful young boy who is on vacation with his family. The vacationers discover that a cholera outbreak in the nearby city of Venice has been kept from them.This is good controversial Italian art-house. It's a tale of desire but not simply a sexual desire. The boy often looks angelic. His beauty is ethereal as well as sexual. Gustave's struggle is palpable in the sweat of his brow. This is not a film of plot. Director Luchino Visconti incorporates a lot of classical music in a study of this man. The demeanor of his pale sickly haunted face is a story in itself.,Death in Venice
3,gavin6942,Odd Coloration,6,17 September 2015,"In this adaptation of the Thomas Mann novel, avant-garde composer Gustave Aschenbach (loosely based on Gustav Mahler) travels to a Venetian seaside resort in search of repose after a period of artistic and personal stress. But he finds no peace there, for he soon develops a troubling attraction to an adolescent boy, Tadzio, on vacation with his family.What strikes me about this film is the odd coloration. Some have said it makes the film look like a moving painting. I can see that, but I also think it looks muted. A step up from Technicolor, but a far cry from other methods. I wish I knew more about cinematography so I could express the thought more clearly.There is a bit of a scandalous subplot, as it suggests pedophilia or something similar. Strange how many films (or books) have heroes (or protagonists) afflicted with this. What are we to make of them? Are they evil or just flawed? The cholera epidemic plays a major part in the story, and it is interesting that the film seems to be known less for that than the ""romance"" angle. Not many films have cholera in them, which seems odd considering its deadliness. Everyone in old movies seems to die from tuberculosis!",Death in Venice
4,lee_eisenberg,"Aschenbach may die, but Thomas Mann's greatness never will.",10,25 June 2005,"Obviously, I can't give away the ending; the title does that. Gustav Von Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde) is a distraught German composer vacationing in Venice. In Venice, he catches sight of fourteen-year-old Tadzio and becomes obsessed with the boy, to the point where he stays in Venice, even as a plague is engulfing the city.So is there a metaphor here? Some people believe that the story may have been portraying homosexuality, even if it didn't get discussed openly. That seems like a logical interpretation, but I have two others to accompany that. First, the plague. They talk about how the plague originated in India. Maybe this was an allusion to the fact that the colonization of the Third World was beginning to affect the developed world. Also, Thomas Mann's novel was published in 1911. World War I began three years later. Maybe Mann was suggesting that the world was reaching a point of no return. Anyway, those are just my interpretations. Regardless of what the story was specifically about, ""Death in Venice"" is a great movie, and I solidly recommend it.",Death in Venice
5,rmax304823,Looking For Love In All The Wrong Places.,8,20 November 2014,"A Nobel Laureate, the German novelist Thomas Mann was always concerned about the relationship between the artist and the society he lived in. He was right to be worried. (He wound up in Los Angeles.) Visconti's film and Mann's novel that it was based on are kind of autobiographical. It's the story of a German professor, played by Dirk Bogarde, who is a composer (author in the novel) with composer's block. It's the turn of the century and, like the 1800s he's played out. His friends advise him to take a trip and find some peace and quiet near the beach in Venice -- the one in Italy, not California. The hotel doesn't turn out to be so quiet. There is, for instance, a sizable Polish family with half a dozen kids chattering away in the lounge and dining room. At first it seems to annoy Bogarde but then he notices a blond boy in his early teens and the kid is stunningly beautiful. Bogarde is attracted to him because an artist is always interested in innocent purity, in whatever form it takes. But his interest turns into something more than a distant admiration and he follows Tadzio around Venice, never speaking to him, let alone touching him. Finally, sweating and ill, Bogarde has the hotel's barber give him a make over -- a hair cut and dye, make up, and lip rouge, ""restoring what nature has taken away."" A caricature of himself, Bogarde continues to follow Tadzio around, while a cholera epidemic sweeps Venice and nails Bogarde himself, who is captured by the ""sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding Death"", while reaching out to the boy on the now-empty strand. The cholera doesn't come out of nowhere; there have been portents -- an early warning against eating fresh fruit, a man collapsing in a railway station, but nobody having to rush off to the toilet. When James Joyce is handing out gifts in ""Finnegans Wake"" he included ""a collera morbous for Mann in the Cloack"" as an homage, an enigmatic sequin reflecting how internationally famous ""Death in Venice"" had become. It's a curious film with all sorts of correspondences. Mann's story was almost autobiographical. He himself was bisexual and Tadzio is closely based on a real Polish boy he met in Venice. Mann gave his main character, Aschenbach, the features of the composer Gustav Mahler, a good friend, whose musical excerpts form the only underscore for the movie. So Mahler is the source of Bogarde's mustache and pince-nez.Visconti has said that the movie was a disaster at its first showing but a producer asked him enthusiastically who had written the melancholy score. ""Gustav Mahler."" ""Great! Can we get him?"" Bogarde himself was bisexual. And Tadzio, despite his being a male, is groomed like a pure young girl throughout, all eye shadow and rosy lips. The other boys have the short hair cuts of the period but Tadzio has a Farrah Fawcett do, so he looks like a figure that might be glimpsed in a Halloween parade in Polk Gulch. Tadzio isn't unaware of Bogarde's interest. From the moment they first see one another in the hotel lounge, coy Tadzio returns Bogarde's rapt gaze with a secret smile. He flirts ostentatiously with the older man. He's later seen kissing a friend. What the hell is up? Have we run out of heterosexuals? Sometimes I think I'm the only straight man left in the universe, except for wearing pantyhose. They keep out the chill and aren't as uncomfortable as you might think.Anyway, Bogarde makes a perfect Aschenbach, troubled, tragic, and ridiculous. He was really a fine actor. Tadzio is a pretty girl. We don't really see much of anyone else. Marisa Berenson isn't on screen nearly enough. We could have used more of her statuesque grace, and if she'd shed her hampering outer garments, the movie would have been ennobled. Wardrobe is superb. Every woman's bonnet has a wide brim and is topped with feathers, bouquets, amuse-bouches, and other stuff that looks like a mobile dropped from the ceiling of an art museum. Venice, a city of gondolas and dreams, looks surprisingly cool, gray, and hazy. I suppose it's disappointing because Venice is in ""Italy"", which is supposed to be sunny in romantic stories. If it had been a few miles away in ""Yugoslavia,"" the absence of sunshine would have been expected.",Death in Venice
6,ma-cortes,Sensitive as well as thoughtful flick about a composer and his quest for beauty and splendor,7,3 April 2015,"This is an adaptation of the Thomas Mann novel , avant-garde composer Gustave Aschenbach (Dick Bogarde) , loosely based on Gustav Mahler character , being well portrayed in this brooding as well as slow-moving classic movie .

It deals with Gustav Mahler lookalike whom Dick Bogarde is made up to resemblance . However , the film results to be overlong , it seems longer than its 130 minutes running time . Colorful as well as visually absorbing cinematography in Panavision by Pascualino de Santis . Impressive and immortal musical score by Mahler , in fact his Third and Fifth Symphonies were adapted as background music for the film ; being excellently conducted by orchestra director Fanco Mannino.This studied as well as slow motion picture was masterfully directed by Luchino Visconti . Visconti was a director and writer, considered to be one of the best Italian filmmakers . At the beginning his career he developed the movement of ""Italian neo-realism"" together with other directors such as Vittorio De Sica or Roberto Rossellini in the 1940s and 1950s such as ¨Bellissima¨ (1952) , ¨La Terra Trema¨(1948) , and ¨Ossessione¨ (1943) was based on James M.

His sense of visual style was equally impressive in his film work, never better demonstrated than through his masterpiece Senso (1954).",Death in Venice
7,moonspinner55,A grim meditation...,5,21 March 2008,"Thomas Mann's highly-regarded book becomes a sparse, inexorable tale of woe, well-acted but all on one dour note. Dirk Bogarde gives a brave performance as an ailing composer, traveling through strife-ridden Italy in the early 1900s, who is helplessly drawn to a handsome youth vacationing in Venice with his family. There have been debates about the nature of Gustav Von Aschenbach's attraction to the boy (he sees in the young man his own faded youth, his neglected childhood, and so on), yet I was under the impression this was a pathetic, deluded infatuation, a homosexual flirtation. This resolution has also been acknowledged--almost reluctantly--with the critic in the N.Y. Times complaining the orientation of the film's subtext was ""too homosexual"" (!). It's a very sad, very slow meditation on the passing of time, filmed in washed-out color and in a consistently low key. An interesting film, but I didn't find much mystery in the central relationship-which-isn't, nor much art in the presentation. ** from ****",Death in Venice
8,Theo Robertson,Yawn . Yawn . Yawn,4,4 October 2005,"The opening of MORTE A VENEZIA resembles a Duran Duran music video with classical music and this is the highlight of the movie "" In terms of what Theo ? "" In terms of everything , but especially excitement . I doubt if there's ever been a more sluggish slower moving movie than this one . Yeah okay it's a European art house movie so I wasn't expecting Charles Bronson to massacre hordes of bad guys but even so I did expect some substance if not an actual plot The film revolves around Professor Gustav Von Aschenbach visiting Venice . Gustav visits Venice and goes on a gondola , Gustav eats in an expensive restaurant , Gustav looks out of his hotel window and if it's excitement you want Gustav has a flashback Bad enough if this was the entire movie but it gets worse because Gustav notices a pretty boy teenager . So you've got a middle aged academic lusting after some teenage boy he has seen , some old queen is becoming obsessed with a stranger . Great idea for a movie ? I don't think so either and thank gawd it remained a yawn fest instead of some sleazy precursor to gay porn I notice a lot of people who praise this movie have tried to intellectualise it . I can only be monosyllabic and unpretentious in my view and say that the only subtext I could relate to was the physical and emotional disintegration of Gustav but it wasn't caused by the effete beauty of the teenage boy - It was caused by watching such a boring and ostentatious movie",Death in Venice
9,Doylenf,A man's furtive quest for idealized beauty of youth...,6,7 January 2007,"Art film lovers would probably rank this much higher on their scale of appreciation, but I found DEATH IN VENICE, while sumptuous to look at and listen to (the music of Gustav Mahler fills the soundtrack with his symphonic music), as beautiful and empty as a multi-colored seashell. It assails the senses with sensuous shots of Tadzio's youthful beauty as seen by DIRK BOGARDE, but fails to give us a narrative strong enough to sustain over two hours of story.Furthermore, it moves at a snail's pace while exploring the beauty of the seashore in Venice, spending far too much time on close-ups of Bogarde as he sinks deeper and deeper into despair over never possessing the creature he so desires. SYLVANA MANGANO, the great Italian actress, is fine as the boy's mother and the fair-haired Italian boy himself (BJORN ANDRESEN) is merely seen and glimpsed from afar and remains an enigma until the very end.Based supposedly on composer Gustav Mahler's personal life (although never actually proved), it's the kind of film that could fill art houses in the '80s with high approval from the pseudo-intellectuals who claimed to have read Thomas Mann's novel and approved of the film's tasteful rendering of a difficult and, at that time, taboo subject.Beauty is in the eye of the beholder--for some, this film is a masterpiece of its kind--for others, beware the tranquility of the whole piece. It may put you in a dreamlike trance.",Death in Venice
10,Vincentiu,Research of sun,10,25 December 2006,"Story of a strange love and a fall desire. Poem about beauty and his perfection, fear and touch.A slice of Visconti, Mahler and Mann. And an agonize Venice. Idon't know if it is a masterpiece, a poem or the reflection of a film director's world. It is, absolutely, a"" memento mori"". and a exploration of illusion. A old mirror of limits, signs and death's delicacy. A trip in an old space, nostalgic, cruel and splendid. ""Death"" is a Orfeu's trip copy in the immediate reality. And the essence is the music. A soft, sweet music, like honey or winter's fire. Like every regret and every sorrow. Like a refuge in deep solitude. Gustav is gay by accident. He is the Researcher of last form of God's presence. The Beauty, that beauty who gives life's sense, who is sin and virtue in same time, the gift of expectations and sufferings. He dies because he has right to hope, to believe in the reality of miracle and in his way. A victim? No way! Only Tadzio may give the freedom like an insignificant sacrifice. Who saw the sun can hope to live in same condition?",Death in Venice
11,JamesHitchcock,A Surfeit of Overripe Beauty,5,17 June 2013,"Thomas Mann's novella ""Death in Venice"", published in 1912, was one of the earliest mainstream literary works of to deal with the subject of homo-erotic desire. Gustav von Aschenbach, a famous German author, travels to Venice, where he meets and becomes obsessed with Tadzio, a beautiful teenage boy whose Polish family are staying in the same hotel. Aschenbach discovers that cholera has broken out in the city but that the authorities, fearful of losing income from tourism, are trying to keep the outbreak a secret. Despite this discovery, Aschenbach neither leaves the city nor warns his fellow-guests, as either course of action would mean his being separated from Tadzio, with whom he has fallen in love.Mann was himself bisexual, and the story is based upon his own experiences while visiting Venice the previous year, when he had also been fascinated by a handsome young Polish boy. The depiction of Aschenbach also draws upon Mann's memories of the composer Gustav Mahler, whom he had known and who had died in 1910; he shares the same first name and Mann's description of his physical appearance would also have fitted Mahler. This may be the reason why, for the purposes of this film, Luchino Visconti made Aschenbach a composer rather than an author and made use of Mahler's music; the famous Adagietto from his Fifth Symphony is passed off as a composition by Aschenbach. Visconti made other changes to the story to strengthen the identification with Mahler. In the book Aschenbach is a childless widower whose wife died many years earlier and who has never remarried. In the film Aschenbach's wife is shown in flashbacks and although she does not accompany him to Venice there is no indication that she has died. (Mahler's wife Alma did not predecease him- indeed, she survived him by more than fifty years). They are, however, shown mourning the death of a young daughter, just as Gustav and Alma Mahler lost a daughter some three years before his death. I first saw this film in the late seventies, a few years after it was made, when I was a teenager studying Mann's book for my German A-Levels. I remember being impressed by it at the time, but then I was a very impressionable young man and probably thought that any art-house film based on a work of classical literature, shot against the background of a famously beautiful city with plenty of classical music on the soundtrack must be a great classic of the cinema, especially if (a) it deals with a controversial subject and (b) nothing much happens except long conversations about Art and the Meaning of Life. Since then my admiration for Mann's novella, a book with a well-deserved reputation as one of the major works of twentieth-century German literature, has grown, whereas my regard for Visconti's film has decreased. Mine is not the normal complaint of the ""loved the book, hated the film"" brigade, namely that the film-makers have altered the story too radically. Apart from the few changes to Aschenbach's circumstances mentioned above, and the omission of the opening scenes set in Munich, Visconti has kept fairly faithfully to Mann's plot. There are, however, some works of literature which do not lend themselves to a cinematic treatment, and ""Death in Venice"" seems to be one of them. There are some good things about the film. The photography of Venice is certainly beautiful, reminiscent of some of Turner's paintings of the city and rivalling that in ""Don't Look Now"", another film from the early seventies set in the same location. Dirk Bogarde was normally a talented actor and the young Björn Andrésen, with his prettier-than-any-girl beauty, certainly looks the part as Tadzio. (Andrésen, who is heterosexual, became something of a gay icon following this role, causing him some embarrassment). The Adagietto is certainly a beautiful piece of music, although I sometimes wonder if its association with this film has done Mahler's long-term reputation any good, leading people to associate him with decadence and morbidity. The problem with the film is that its good looks are all on the surface. Mann's novella contains little in the way of action and not much in the way of dialogue; the two main characters, Aschenbach and Tadzio, never exchange a single word. Its significance lies beneath the surface, on the psychological and philosophical levels. On the personal level it is a character-study of a man who has striven to live an ascetic life, governed by discipline, restraint and reason, but who finds his world- view shattered by the sudden realisation of his own powerful sexual desires for a boy. On the philosophical level it is an examination of two contrasting attitudes to life, the Apollonian life of reason and the Dionysian life of passion, a concept derived from Mann's study of the philosopher Nietzsche. Visconti, who was an intelligent man, doubtless understood the complexities of Mann's work, but it is these very complexities which make it difficult to adapt for the screen. The contrast between Apollonianism and Dionysianism is not a naturally cinematic subject, and the complicated inner life of an intellectual writer or musician, unaccompanied by some dramatic outward action, is equally difficult to dramatise. Visconti is never able to find a substitute for Mann's ideas. The lengthy debates between Aschenbach and a fellow-composer about musical aesthetics do not add much interest; they simply help to make a lengthy and tedious film even more so. The film may be beautiful, but it is also dull and long-winded, and in such a context its beauty becomes something excessively rich and cloying. In Mann's story Aschenbach dies after eating an overripe strawberry, and this becomes an appropriate image for an overblown film in which Dirk Bogarde appears to die of a surfeit of overripe beauty. Too much Venice, and too much Mahler, can be bad for your health. 5/10",Death in Venice
12,paul2001sw-1,A new vocabulary of film,7,17 October 2005,"'Death in Venice' is arguably Thomas Mann's masterwork, the tale of a man's obsession, part pure and partly paedophillic, with a beautiful young boy. But the story proceeds purely through mood-shifts, there's little in the way of events or dialogue, and so it's interesting to see how Luchino Visconti has turned it into a movie: indeed, the way he has done so draws to one's attention how similar the majority of movies are. For denied (by the nature of his story) access to the conventional tools of film-making, Visconti instead builds a sequence of images and sounds, lavish collages in which the subtlest detail, the direction of a glance of the tone of the sky, speaks volumes. In some ways watching this film, with its backdrop of a Turneresque Venice, is really quite like visiting a gallery. Dirk Bogarde is good in the lead role, not quite as I expected the character, but it's still a fine performance; while Visconti adds the faintest trace of a back-story, inserted in intermittent flashback scenes, to provide a hint of variety to punctuate the foreground tale. But overall, the film is remarkably consistent, not just with the plot, but also with the mood and purpose of the book, a feat that actually requires considerable innovation and vision given how unaccommodating to conventional script-writing the original story is.I have one criticism: whereas the novella is short but perfectly formed, the film is not so brief, and perhaps could have been shorter. And one final comment: having seen this film, it strikes me how similar it is to another Venice-set movie (dating from just a couple of years later): Nic Roeg's own masterpiece, 'Don't Look Now'.",Death in Venice
13,atlasmb,"A Slow-Moving, Repetitious Exploration of Limited Themes",5,19 June 2017,"I don't usually write reviews with spoilers, but it is nearly impossible to discuss this film without revealing some of its major plot points, especially since there are so few of them.""Death in Venice"" is based upon a Thomas Mann novel. It is said Mann was inspired when he heard of Gustav Mahler's death. Mann was gay and Mahler was presumed by many to be gay, despite his marriage and offspring. So, Mann created the story about Gustav Aschenbach, borrowing elements from Mahler's life and his own.Aschenbach is, like Mahler, a creator--specifically a writer. While in Venice, he is consumed by two things: his concern about his own health and his fascination with a fourteen-year-old boy. His focus on the boy becomes an obsession and that obsession takes up ninety percent of the film.Director Visconti--also a gay man--decided to make Aschenbach a composer. He also used some Mahler symphonies as background music.The other ten percent of the film are mundane happenings and Aschenbach's internal dialogue, with flashbacks that include philosophical discussions about art. (Does art arise from the intellect or the senses?) But these are minor, undeveloped diversions from the film's main themes. The cinematography is sometimes evocative of the works of William Turner or, more often, of Renoir. But the camera work often undermines the images, especially when Visconti repeatedly uses zoom to beat the viewer over the head with the obvious. The pace of the film is leisurely. That can be explained, in part, by the fact that the film takes place in the world of the leisure class. Aschenbach is living among those who are restrained and mannered. Starched collars and stiff behavior are the norm. But the languorous tempo only serves to accentuate the fact that this is a film in which very little actually happens. In the end, this film is not very entertaining. And its main themes have been explored much more effectively in other films.",Death in Venice
14,Rodrigo_Amaro,Love It Or Hate It But Try To Watch More Than Once Even If Hating It,9,25 June 2010,"Definitely one of the most difficult, artistic, powerful and discussed films ever made ""Death in Venice"" had an almost impossible mission: Put blood on the veins of a story in which almost nothing happens and yet have a statement to made. If you consider that's quite difficult to read the book (I abandoned after 10 pages thinking that Thomas Mann took too long to told the story only pointing views on art and similar things which I felt very close to other book of his called ""Tonio Kroeger"" a very good book) you're gonna think that this cannot be filmed. Luchino Visconti tried, conquered and made an important film. But I must say this film entered in my list of one the most hated movies I ever watched and it only got out of it this year after 6 years of my first view. By the time I watched I didn't care much for it, I was expecting a more developed story, a few more movements than it doesn't have and at the end I didn't get it all. A few years later, and much more older, finally I found ""Death in Venice"" an more complete film than it was years ago and thanks to the brilliant and unique performance of Dirk Bogarde I think I went further on my notions of perception of what's the story and what's the point of it. Still has some doubts about the excessive use of artistic licenses used by the screenplay and some never answered questions but still is a great movie.Bogarde plays Gustav Von Aschenbach a famous composer that travels to a Venetian seaside resort in search of repose after a period of artistic and personal stress that includes the death of his son. His heart is weak, his emotional state is a completely mess, and he's desperate to achieve something great with his music. To make his travel worst (perhaps better depending on your view) he meets a beautiful young boy named Tadzio (Björn Andrésen, good actor with a magnetic presence almost without saying any lines) a teenage boy traveling with his parents. Gustav can't stop looking at Tadzio and vice-versa but the meaning between the look they gave to each other is very different. Alternating with the trip to Venice Visconti shows us some flashbacks of Gustav's life while he was married; the conversations about the notion of art and real beauty with his friend Alfred (Mark Burns), and Gustav's breakdown which led him to Venice. Pay attention very closely to the conversations between Alfred and Gustav about beauty, and what a real artist is. These moments always get something to say about what Gustav is doing in Venice searching for Tadzio in all places even knowing that there's a epidemic of Cholera coming to town.I don't know if the movie follows the book exactly but I think some notions of the main character were drastically changed. For instance people always say that Gustav is a cloistered homosexual, but in the film if you really pay attention Gustav is a little bit far of it, he was married with a women, and his supposed sexual interest in Tadzio comes from his thoughts about pure beauty, something that really makes him feel complete (along with his music) and that's what he really sees in Tadzio. Of course, there's the enigmatic and provocative look that Tadzio got in his eyes: ""You must never smile like that. You must never smile like that at anyone."" says Gustav to himself in one scene (best quote of the movie). Before you start to think that he's a pedophiliac, calm down and see Gustav's trying some approaches but doing noting except look and think about the boy. The book is one focus (Gustav's point of view) and so does the movie. If it wasn't we would be able to know what Tadzio had on his mind with such gestures. Be patient and try to watch more than once because this is one of those films when you don't get the general idea by watching one time. It grows with you and the more you see, more the vision of what you think this story is it changes. Dirk Bogarde has the performance of a lifetime here and I can't imagine another actor playing Gustav. His last and moving scene is the most impacting and powerful scenes ever filmed: his character sitting in the chair, dying of the cholera, looking for the last time Tadzio running in the beach. Very well photographed. Gustav Mahler's music are well played in a good synchronized scenes. One of the forgotten films at the Academy Awards of 1972 it was nominated for best costumes (it lost for ""Nicholas and Alexandra""). The costume designs are beautifully made and it is a key part for the film; notice the first time Gustav sees Tadzio dressed in white with some blue lines on the shirt, almost like if he was an angel to Gustav. What a vision! 9/10",Death in Venice
15,Dr_Coulardeau,Sickeningly beautiful,10,15 October 2016,"It all starts at the end with death entering the beach on the signal, call, invitation to lift yourself up towards the horizon and get through the door, the promise of some beauty that will never die and you have always looked for and had never been able to really find because you looked for it in pure patterns, motifs and other figures that were abstract in music and that rejected all emotions, sensations, passions, feelings. In other words the heart.At the end of his life Gustav Aschenbach discovers that a teenager, hardly more than fifteen is the beauty he has looked for all along, and he finally finds when he accepts his senses, his eyes, and his sudden attraction and emotion in front of it, of him, of Tadzio. And the blatant and blinding beauty of this youth dances in his mind, becomes a whirlwind and a hurricane in his soul. He has fallen in love with that young man, well under age for sure, and he will close his life with that gesture towards the pure sky. He will try to imitate Tadzio's gesture and he will die transmitting his insane project to this Tadzio who knew the old man was trying to get in touch with him but he was too young, and had too many relatives around him to try to contact that mysterious encounter in spite of his curiosity. That's the most insane desire an older man has: to be able to transcend death and transfer all that he has not done, he has not been able to do to that younger man he has never spoken to and yet has become an idol, an angel, a god even, definitely the one who will carry the old man's future to that future the old man will never know. That feeling is disjointed, some critics will say. And it is, for anyone who considers the normal humdrum banal world of everyday to be the proper way of assembling the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle. But if you look back in passion and in love, maybe in anger too, you find out it is the way you assemble the pawns on the chessboard just before dying that is the proper way, the best way to live in this world, and yet the older man is dying.Everything in the film is of course transforming Venice into a trap for the older man, the composer and conductor, and yet an escape way for Tadzio, the teenager who has opened the older man's consciousness to what he had ignored, ,or refused to consider, all his life. And that is pure justice: the younger one must be able to escape the death of the older one but the younger one is then, entrusted with continuing the older one's dreams, transcending their limits, transmuting their fears into light and heat, into bliss and ecstacy, the acme of spirituality, the spearhead of discovery and inventiveness.Yet the epidemic spreading in Venice is turned into a very heavy and stifling atmosphere that reminds us of some kind of medieval vision of some plague, black or bubonic, who cares. And yet the film also has a hefty and even cruel sense of humor with the four street musicians singing for the hotel guests and yet provoking them as the foreigners they are who do not understand Italian, and that's better for them because we can imagine from the body language of the main musician the obscenity of the discourse. Some flashbacks enable us to understand the context of this old man, his happy marriage and fatherhood, and the burial of his daughter when she was still young, the debate with his main friend about music and purity, the refusal of evil in man and hence of any sentiment that would make the music too concrete and material to still be music. At the same time the hammering of Beethoven's ""Für Elise"" when visiting what can only be a shady house and the same piece being played by Tadzio one day. Tadzio playing brings back the recollection of this event from the past back and it soils the boy in a way since he is associated with a shady lady with whom yet the old man had no contact at all, except her playing the music and her taking off some of her garments. This is probably the real dilemma of the character: he always knew beauty was in the intensity of his desires and feelings, but he always refused to yield, well not quite always after all since he was married and had a daughter. But that was made pure by the sacrament behind the relationship and the procreative instinct. But was it only that or did it become that after the death of the daughter? You will not be able to answer that question. So we are back to the final scene which is the whole story we want to remember in two gestures, in some mute and silent body language that enables the older man to finally talk to Tadzio by imitating his gesture. And yet he will be carried away disgracefully by two hotel servants with the few last tourists who have not yet left significantly stepping back from him.Death always has the last word and yet love may be able to have the next word, but the impossible connection with Tadzio makes this next word very problematic.A beautiful very sad and yet humane film with the phenomenal music of Gustav Mahler in the background surging from time to time to the foreground.

16,jzappa,Falls Short of the Intention Behind Its Technique,7,12 September 2008,"One of my favorite films of all time is Sonatine, a film at a standstill in time with its characters. It is a gangster film, but the vast majority of the movie is a bunch of them in the countryside waiting directionlessly and killing time. Or how about another one of my favorite movies, There Will Be Blood? It is two and a half hours long, allows no clarity in its characters, of which there are really only three, and has little dialogue with an abundant use of dissonant music, set in a dry, arid region of the male-dominated, radically religious Texas of the early 1900s. Another that may even surpass both of these is a Romanian picture called 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, which is entirely constructed of scenes done in single stationary takes of indefinite extent, often fixated on a motionless, speechless character for the duration of a scene, and the movie has no music at all.What I am demonstrating is that I am by no means averse to slow movies. Death In Venice, then again, has all the length and banality of the aforementioned movies but none of the dramatic engagement.Dirk Bogarde plays a failed composer who voyages to Venice for health reasons. There, he grows to be infatuated with an pubescent Polish boy who is staying with his family at the same hotel. Playing the role of Bogarde's music in the film is the music of Gustav Mahler. Mahler may well be understood as a fitting musician to bring into play on account of his unease with death, which he harnessed to his compositions. Flashback scenes include Bogarde and a musician friend debating the tarnished temperament of his music.While Bogarde makes an attempt to achieve serenity, the remainder of Venice is spellbound by a cholera outbreak, and the city authorities do not notify the tourists of the epidemic for fear that they will lose their business. As Bogarde and the other guests make outings into the city center it finally strikes them that something is gravely amiss. Bogarde resolves to depart, although in a flash of compulsion opts to stay. But, he himself is dying. Nevertheless he is revitalized by the presence of the young boy, though they never actually converse. Maybe it is that I have never quite understood the sort of story that hinges upon superficial obsession like the beauty of a youthful Adonis, who in this case frankly looks uncannily like a girl in many scenes. I admire its attempt at portraying humanity in a completely nonjudgmental manner, and by that I am mostly giving kudos to Thomas Mann's original work since it is the basis for this film, but the film version at least gives no considerable reason why one should feel the intended urge for Bogarde to confront the boy. Or is that even the intention?The camera abruptly tightens on negligible commotion during the setting, seeking to highlight the kismet of a visually attractive moment. For instance, the camera will keep hold of and insistently stay on a flying bird, a unit of men marching or a slow-moving cloud. This is altogether amalgamated with the clear scarcity of dialogue. I'm not asserting that it is inherently ineffective to make a film wherein the actors must emote without the assistance of speaking, because Ingmar Bergman proved many times the extent of that technique's effectiveness. Luchino Visconti, however, whose other films are surely vastly superior, falls short of avow his film's foundation.",Death in Venice
17,thinker1691,""" That smile. You must never smile like that at anyone but me """,8,24 January 2009,"Thomas Mann's controversial novel is the basis for the film ""A Death in Venice. "" Although in the book, the hero is an author, in the film the director Luchino Visconti who also wrote the screenplay, transforms him into a Composer. As such, the Author/Composer, Gustav Von Aschebach (Dirk Bogarde) on the verge of mental exhaustion is a burned-out artisan. After a long and successful career now seeks the peace and tranquility of a less hectic life. He decides to go on vacation to Venice where he hopes to rejuvenate his dwindling ambition. However, while staying at the picturesque seaside resort, he captures the attention of a beautiful young teenage boy, Tadzio (Björn Andrésen) who eyes him with curious interest and is immediately smitten by him. Although Gustav is captivated by the wondrous youth, he nevertheless must find some private time away from the boy's governess (Nora Ricci), while having to cope with a invading plague which seems to have infested the city. The movie dialog, like the novel remains subtle as are the few brief encounters between the boy and the artist. In the end. the audience unlike the book is hampered with innuendos and imaginative flights of fancy. Their affair is never given wing, substance or opportunity and were it not for the brief resolution in the book, the film allows only the possibility of 'what if.' Nevertheless, one can sympathize with the hero and wish him a moment's peace to obtain that which is forbidden, elusive but definitely criticized by prying eyes.

18,JasparLamarCrabb,Your eyes will ache...,2,4 September 2006,"One of the great short movies made into a rather long and stodgy film. Luchino Visconti takes Mann's slender novel and turns the story into into something it is not...a baroque, snail paced horror film. Dirk Bogarde, looking ghoulish in white-face, gives a very stiff almost robotic performances as Aschenbach. Surely the great Visconti had visions of grand opera planned for this, but DEATH IN VENICE just lumbers on and on and on. While lovely to look at, the movie ranks as one of the toughest to watch. With the beautiful Marisa Berenson.",Death in Venice
19,yusufpiskin,Björn Andrésen; The Most Beautiful Boy In The World,9,3 March 2021,"Visconti's version of the Thomas Mann novel is a meditation on the purity of art and how it corrupts the impure heart. Hebrew scripture tells us that ""no one can look on the face of God and live."" Gustav von Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde), in the novel a famous author, is transcribed by the Italian director into a contemporary renowned composer whose work has evolved beyond popularity into a higher realm, an atmosphere where pure art alone can flourish. He is is tortured by a friend in philosophic debate, suffers the death of his small daughter, misunderstood by once adoring audiences, and in a state of near physical and mental collapse. Since Bogarde is made up to resemble the Austro-Bohemian composer Gustav Mahler, and that man's music (3rd and 5th Symphonies) form the bulk of the soundtrack, that link is unavoidable in assessing the film, especially since the movie is now regarded as a minor classic.For those unfamiliar with the story, it involves von Aschenbach's homoerotic fascination with a young Polish boy of classic beauty (Björn Andrèsen) that he spots while vacationing alone for his health (he has a bad heart) in Venice. There he sees the lad while dining, seated at a small table for one, the first night of his stay at the Grand Hôtel des Bains on the resort island of Lido. The composer begins to observe the lad surreptitiously; the youth stands out because of his refined appearance, and because he is the only male in the group which includes the boy's aristocratic mother (Silvana Mangano), a cluster of sisters of lesser age, and another adult female (Nora Ricci), possibly an aunt or a governess.Concurrently the tourist season is underway... but the annual scirocco is lingering and the city is gripped by an incursion of Asian cholera. Here the director begins his little game of linking von Aschenbach's hidden desire to public manifestations of the epidemic: first a man collapses unexpectedly in a public area; then he spots a city worker splashing a white disinfectant along the base of buildings and a bridge; and most tellingly, he can't seem to get clear or honest answers about what's going on in the city from the hotel manager, or people he questions on the street.When he hears the mother call the boy Tadzio, he clamps onto that name as a link to his ""obscure object of desire""... almost as if knowledge of the name implies some sort of relationship with him. In a odd scene, the man exchanges a glance with the boy on a hotel elevator, which he then assumes is the cause of looks and subdued laughter that passes among the other youths in the elevator with them. Ashamed and embarrassed, von Aschenbach decides to the leave the city, but when he is unexpectedly separated from his baggage, he changes his mind and decides to stay in Venice until his trunk is returned. The faint smile that passes over his face at this moment, gives the game away. His fascination has become an obsession; he begins to take every opportunity to be where he knows Tadzio will be and finally he becomes a stalker... so much so that the adults take notice and begin to make efforts to gather the boy close to them when they see the intense man in a white suit lurking about.I'm sure the affair is linked in Aschenbach's mind to a search for classic beauty, but he's clearly not being honest with himself. That much is given away when he visits the hotel barber to get his hair dyed black, and he takes to wearing powder, rouge, and eyeliner in an attempt to look younger. But it's a clown's face, and instead he looks ridiculous.Too late we begin to notice signs that he has contracted the disease even to the point where one day, as he is trailing the family through some backstreets there is an apotheosis: Venice has grown dark and smoky, piles of contaminated refuse are burning in the public squares -- it's a vision of Gehenna. And as the boy and his family disappear over an arched bridge, von Aschenbach collapses against a wall, without the strength to stand or proceed because of a raging fever.And what are we to make of the final scene, which is romantic, horrifying, and pathetic all at the same time? The composer has made it to the beach at the hotel and taken up station in his familiar beach chair. He sees Tadzio, alone now - finally separated from his family - a local youth wrestles with the boy and roughs him up in a familiar manner but Tadzio pulls away and wades slowly out into the shallow sea. Von Ashenbach is agitated and tries to rise but he hasn't the strength. The morning light is behind the youth so that he is only a silhouette with classic form, one hand resting on his hip, posed like the statue of a Greek god. Suddenly he raise his arm and points to the horizon. The gesture is ambiguous... we don't know what to make of it. At that moment his elder admirer collapses in death...Regardless of your interpretation, ""Death in Venice"" is mesmerizing... slow-paced and foreboding, but eminently watchable. It's like a fever dream, or a cautionary fable. But Bagarde's performance, with only a minimum of significant dialog, is a tour de force! And Andrèsen, while too young to be a skilled actor, is directed by Visconti to be an ambiguous ideal... either the highest manisfestation of art, or the forbidden fruit that robs the partaker of Eden.",Death in Venice
20,rooprect,Death while watching Death in Venice,2,27 April 2007,"This is the only movie that ever put me to sleep. And I've watched some real snoozers before.Just to let you know that I'm not some typical Hollywood speed freak (which is the immediate, predictable assumption made about anyone who calls a film ""boring""), I want you to know that my favourite films include ""Werckmeister Harmoniak"" (which features an 8-minute scene of a boy eating soup), ""Dong"" (which features an equally long scene of a girl mopping the floor) and ""Fitzcarraldo"" (which features interminable scenes of Klaus Kinski's face). In other words, I have nothing against slow movies...when they have something to say.This, on the other hand, is quite obviously a mediocre director's self-indulgent attempt to act like the big boys. It has all the length and banality of the artistic masterpieces but none of the art. In addition, it is extremely juvenile in presentation--the way my homemade movies were when I was 16.For example, there's a scene where the lead character is getting dressed. He pauses at the mirror, picks up a photo and kisses it. The camera feels the need to zoom in on this action abruptly as if it say ""LOOK! HE'S KISSING A PICTURE! WHO'S PICTURE IS IT? HMMM?"" Several minutes later he picks up a different photo and kisses it. Again, the camera jerks us into tightframe as if to say ""LOOK ANOTHER ONE! SEE? WHO IS IT THIS TIME?"" This is just one example of the director's juvenile and heavy-handed approach to what should have been a subtle film. Other examples include cameras abruptly zooming in on trivial background action, as if trying to emphasize the serendipity of an interesting moment. For example, the camera will latch on to & relentlessly follow a bird in flight, a brigade of men marching or a passing cloud. It makes me feel as if the director has a severe case of ADHD and cannot focus on one thought without flying off to whatever incongruous and distracting spectacles catch his eye.The camera movements are rather clumsy and awkward, which is OK if that's the director's gimmick (à la Lars Von Trier) but not if it is unintentional. This is a film whose story, setting and music call for equally elegant and graceful camera motion; yet we get something akin to a African nature documentary instead.All of this lumped with the obvious lack of dialogue and acting adds up to boredom. The director fails to assert his theme. And a themeless movie is nothing but a MTV video without the music. Don't be suckered by the bloated rating from IMDb's pseudo Euro-intellectuals. These are the same people who think Godard is a great director. Werner Herzog (a genuinely talented filmmaker) called Godard ""intellectual counterfeit money"". I'm sure he would have said the same about the obscure loon who directed this waste of film. If you want to see some true artistic films, check out the list I've posted in my profile page--or as I like to call it ""Artsy movies that don't suck wind"".I give ""Death in Venice"" 2 stars, only because I reserve the 1-star badge of shame for movies that have live animal killings.",Death in Venice
21,Spleen,Mahler is apt.,10,25 June 2001,"His music, especially what we hear of it here, is very slow.  From around the time of Bach's death composers had been working out ways of making music progress at a slower and slower pace: over a century later, Wagner and then Mahler wrote pieces that are about as slow as it is possible for music to get.  -Of course, one can cheat by writing a 4/4 march and then specifying a tempo of, say, semiquaver = 1, but that tempo wouldn't be the correct tempo. Wagner and Mahler wrote music that is PROPERLY played at a snail's pace. Given that the slowness in no sense sounds too slow ""snail's pace"" is the wrong expression.  A critic wrote of a famous Wagner conductor, ""He doesn't beat time, he beats eternity.""  For all I know this was meant as a compliment.I get the feeling that around the early 1970s directors worked out how to make the slowest possible films: there's ""Death in Venice"", and there's ""Solyaris"".  I much prefer the former.  For one thing, ""Solyaris"" steps over the line, or some line, and becomes soporific; ""Death in Venice"" is gripping from beginning to end.  Not much happens, but it all happens in the right sequence, at the right pace, with photography you can get lost inAnother way of cheating with music, by the way, is to write something that doesn't really have a tempo at all.  Such music sounds slow, but is really just unmusical, just as many films feel slow because they lack rhythm and form.  ""Death in Venice"" isn't one of them.  Beautiful in every respect, it will remind you of the timelessness and contextlessness of quality.  You need no theoretical knowledge to respond to Visconti's mastery, as you do to respond to a lesser director's incompetence.  It's a great work.",Death in Venice

23,onepotato2,rudimentary trash from Visconti,1,22 May 2010,"'Death in Venice' can only be termed 'experimental,' and offers viewers a nasty, fatalist thesis (We become what we deplore) and an icky storyline about an aging failure's obsession with an adolescent boy. There is at least as much in the movie that indicates he wants a carnal relationship with the boy, as there is to support that he's undergoing a chaste, parental paean to lost youth and fleeting beauty.Twenty minutes into this (the longest 20 minutes of your life) 'Death in Venice' has staked out some pretty dire territory: dwelling on the obvious / remaining in an undeveloped holding pattern. Visconti's gloss on the book could only be described as 'salacious-minimalism.' The whole thing is pretty much destroyed by its inability to move beyond its instantly grasped premise, and the decision to practically eliminate scripted utterances; save for 3 or 4 poorly acted & inserted purple speeches about beauty, truth, etc.Technically, it has very ugly camera-work straight out of the 70s. Visconti apparently rejected all of his previous refinement, and aggressively futzes with the brand-new 'zoom' button on his camera. He uses it with no subtlety whatsoever. Apparently he wanted to be seen as an early adopter for the now-abandoned camera innovation. Beyond that, the imagery is all too well-lit and flat. It feels like an episode of 'Three's Company.' Dirk Bogarde gives a poor, schematic performance of an uptight sad-sack who looks more than a little like Percy Dovetonsils. The low quality of this movie is pretty shocking. I mean Visconti made The Leopard, for god's sake. All of Death in Venice resembles that movie's indulgent, climactic ballroom sequence, which receives uniform critical raves, but which is too long, overstates points already made in better portions of the film, and brings things to a complete standstill.",Death in Venice
24,Galina_movie_fan,Beauty Found and Lost in Venice: Mann + Mahler +Visconti = a Masterpiece,10,11 December 2006,"I first saw ""Death in Venice"" 1971) about 15 years ago, found it profoundly moving and often thought about it. Watching it again few days ago, I realized that it is close to the top of the great works of cinema. With hardly any dialog it captivates a viewer with the beautiful cinematography, the fine acting, and, above all, the Mahler's music without which the movie simply could not exist.""Death in Venice"" is a stunning Luchino Visconti's adaptation of the Thomas Mann novella about a famous composer (in the novella he was a writer but making him a composer in a movie was a great idea that works admirably) Gustav von Aschenbach (loosely based on Gustav Mahler) who travels to Venice in the summer of 1911 to recover from personal losses and professional failures. His search for beauty and perfection seems to be completed when he sees a boy of incredible divine beauty. Ashenbach (Dirk Bogard) follows the boy everywhere never trying to approach him. The boy, Tadzio, belonged to very rare creatures that own an enigmatic and inconceivable power which captivates you, enchants you, conquers you and makes you its prisoner. Ashenbach became one of the prisoners of Tadzio spellbinding charms. He became addicted to him; he fell in love with him. Was it bless or curse for him? I think both. He died from unreachable, impossible yet beautiful love which object was perfection itself. The last image Ashenbach's eyes captured was that of the boy's silhouette surrounded by the sea and golden sun light. Nothing could compare to the beauty and charm of the scene and to take it with you to the grave is the death one can only dream about. If he could, Ashenbach probably would've said, ""I was able to witness one of the faces of perfection, I could not bear it but I was chosen to learn that it exists here, in this world and I can die in peace now because it did happen to me."" Unforgettable music, Gustav Mahler's haunting adagietto of his Fifth Symphony found perfect use in a perfect movie. It reflects every emotion of a main character - it sobs, it longs, it begs for hope, and it summarizes the idea that once you are blessed to encounter beauty you are condemned to die. I may come up with hundreds movies that use classical music to perfection but nothing will ever compare to ""Death in Venice"". I dare say that Mahler's music IS its main character - it would change and sound differently depending on what was happening on the screen. It sounded triumphantly when Ashenbach returned back to Venice, to what he thought would be his happiness but turned to be his death. It sounded gloomy when he first entered Venice from the sea. You can hear so many different feelings in it - tenderness and adoration, confusion and self-loathing, worship and melancholy, but always - LOVE that gives the purest happiness and breaks the hearts (literally). The movie for a viewer is similar to what the boy was for the aging composer/writer/Artist. We are enchanted and captivated by its power and beauty as much as Achenbach was by the boy's mysterious charm.",Death in Venice
25,marcin_kukuczka,Saw Venice and Died... Our Right Feelings In the Long Run,7,4 November 2007,"Luchino Visconti has become famous to the world after his marvelous production THE LEOPARD. Movie fans got to know the style of the director who introduced himself as one among the post war new realists, an aristocrat who developed his individual free thinking and, consequently, expressed them as an artist. However, when applied to this movie, MORTE A VENEZIA based upon the novel by Thomas Mann, it's a slightly different story.The entire film is, at first view, so unique, so psychological and so much influenced by the various thoughts of an artist (both director and main character Gustav von Aschenbach) that it seems to be ""unwatchable"" for many viewers. Therefore, such opinions about the movie rose as being ""too slow"", ""unendurable"" or ""endless boredom"". Why? The reason seems to lie in a significant view widespread nowadays: ""GOOD MOVIE IS PARALLEL TO FLAWLESS ACTION."" Here, it would be appropriate to say: ""GOOD MOVIE IS PARALLEL TO NO ACTION."" As a matter of fact, everyone would be able to say one sentence about the whole movie's content and that would suffice. All that we find in MORTE A VENEZIA has a sense of vague reality filled with both profoundity and shallowness that appear to be significant for the sake of each single moment. And it is so when we notice the psychedelic scenes in Venice, when we see Gustav at the railroad station, when we are supplied with his intensely emotional memories. The insight into his decaying mind is sometimes so intense that the only way for the viewer to go on watching the film is to do his/her best to feel and experience rather than see and think. All is doomed to fade, to wither like flowers on meadow when their time comes. In other words, all has a sense of loss and death without many events or even dialogs. As a result, it is quite unlikely that you will get the idea of the movie after a single viewing. It must be seen more than twice with the mind that is constantly open. If you'll like it or not...that's a different story, very personal one.The artistic values are the factor that is noticeable at first sight and stays with us throughout. Beauty as something very meaningful for the main character that appears to come and leave; rest as something he's heading for so badly and which comes to him in the most unexpected way; feeling that he finds in a teenage boy who appears as a model of all the dreams and desires, as a forbidden fruit of homosexual lust which vanishes. The costume designer Piero Tosi does a splendid job in this movie. Through lots of wonderful wardrobe he supplies us with a very realistic view of 1911 when the action takes place. The cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis provides us with a terrific visual experience that can be called a real feast for the eyes. And in the background comes Gustav Mahler's music, the composer whose life inspired Thomas Mann to introduce the character. The performances are top notch, particularly from Dirk Bogart as the main character, Gustav von Aschenbach, who wants a rest after hard artistic job and vainly attempts to find it in crowded Venice. For the majority of the film, we have a great insight into his thoughts, feelings and acts of anger, exhaust and despair. Though sometimes depressing, he keeps us on the right track till the end not losing hope for the less tragic end... Tadzio (Bjorn Andersen) depicts the model of decadent homosexual desire but also a model of beauty and purity that appears to last pretty short... ""Adieu Tadzio, it was all too short"" says the main character. A great, though very controversial, job is done by Mark Burns as a sort of ""super ego"" Alfred with whom Gustav polemics about such ideals as beauty, justice, hope, human dignity. For Alfred, beauty belongs to the senses. How Freudian, yet how dangerous the idea might be! And ever present in artistic Italian movies of the time, Silvana Mangano - here as an elegant lady from Poland, Tadzio's mother.Memorable moments indeed constitute the movie's strong points; yet, not all viewers will find them unforgettable. They, similarly to the whole odd movie, require much effort to get onto the right track in director's individual ego and within the four walls of his psyche. Among such scenes, I consider the beach sequence pretty important, particularly the way Gustav observes Tadzio. The physical distance accurately represents the lack of courage to come closer... I also appreciate the shots when Gustav is sitting in the gondola and the city's view moves in the background - how memorably that may raise existential thoughts of transfer. Aren't we, people, a sort of ""passangers"" in the world, in the journey that life is.In the end, I must tell you one important thing. I had found MORTE A VENEZIA extremely weird until I started to look deeper at what the director is really trying to convey. Then, every scene turned out to be meaningful in its interpretation with which you don't have to agree (I hardly agree with anything the main character does) but you should at least tolerate this as something the author badly wanted to say. Listen to his voice, allow him for a few words in one page of reality...Therefore, there is a long way towards understanding the film since not many movies like that were being made in 1971 and are being made now. Paradoxically, it seems that we are all bound to have the right feelings about this film in the long run similarly to that we are all bound to experience once a strange, unavoidable, usually unexpected reality that death is... 7/10",Death in Venice

There is minimal dialogue in the film and the music by Mahler enhances the beauty of the movie as does the lack of spoken words.In the early 1900's a sick and aged Professor visits a hotel in Venice. His life is a wreck as revealed in flashbacks. There are layers of troubles afflicting the Professor including old age and also- on my interpretation- his coming to terms with being a gay. At this late stage of his life and to add to his troubles the burden of so many years living a lie as a ""straight"" has caught up with him.But then:Along comes a golden beautiful adolescent also staying at the hotel; an erotic youth whose body language flirts with the professor, and such actions may be real or maybe just a tease. Apparently it is the youth who encourages the professor who in turn fully reciprocates and whose inner desires may at long last become reality. But is the Professors age a perversion compared to the youth of the golden boy?So:Will the professor finally put an end to his repressed and hidden desires hence, a Death in Venice?

27,barryrd,A unique achievement,9,21 June 2017,"I saw this movie in 1971 when I was very young. All I recall is a very sad story about an artist who was very ill when visiting Venice where he spent time furtively seeking out a boy he was attracted to. It was sad and depressing and a bit creepy. I watched it again 45 years later on TCM and it seemed to be a much more powerful statement about a tragic life and death that reaches its climax in Venice during a sweltering summer in 1911 when the city is overtaken by a cholera epidemic. The main role is played by Dirk Bogarde, a British actor, who is making the best of his last days longing for a love he can never achieve.The background music by Mahler is very sombre and fits the tragic ending. The city is being scrubbed to stop the spread of disease and no one wants to frighten away the tourists, who are the city's economic lifeblood. Again, the symbolic conflict between dreams and reality. The acting is superb. The period costumes are stunning. The photography is powerful and sweeping with seas, sunsets and the skyline of Venice. This movie is not entertainment but a work of art. I couldn't take more than one of these works at a time but it is worth seeing as a unique achievement.",Death in Venice
28,raymond-15,Unforgettable romantic drama,8,18 May 2004,"Set in Venice mainly on the Lido, Visconti's ""Death in Venice"" is a triumph of filmmaking combining the excellence of Dirk Bogarde's characterisation and expert photography of the resort area in all its various daily moods. For those who love Venice, this is a film to cherish.Mahler's music frequently heard throughout the film heightens the drama. The mood it creates is not always happy.  But then what else would you expect with a title like that?There is not a lot of dialogue in the film. Rather sparse in fact. It's mainly background noises and chatter and laughter among the hotel guests. The intriguing part is to interpret the exchange of glances between Gustav von Aschenbach a composer of some renown and a slim teenage youth Tadzio who see each other from time to time across the tables of the hotel dining room, on the beach and at odd unexpected places around Venice.  They seem to acknowledge each other's presence shyly at first with little more than the suggestion of a smile but later with a strong and riveting and urgent gaze.Each viewer will have his own interpretation.  The composer has lost a child of his own.  Is this behaviour an expression of yearning for the child he loved?  Is it perhaps a sexual attraction towards this fragile young man with his dazed somewhat girlish stare?  Could he be discovering some new inspiration for a yet unwritten musical masterpiece?  Who knows?From beginning to end this film captures the true spirit of 19th Century Venice.  The elegance of the ladies, the deck chairs on the sand, the children frolicking in their neck-to-knee bathing costumes, the glow of sunsets and a general feeling of satisfaction with the world.  While some may think the pace is rather slow at times, the film has an overall gentle quality, but with a simmering indecision between two repressed human beings. Be prepared for a sad and beautiful ending.",Death in Venice
29,ItalianGerry,The best possible film of Mann's novella.,10,7 June 2004,"Luchino Visconti's ""Death in Venice"" is a masterpiece of utterly haunting beauty that will capture the imagination of anyone interested in the screen's capacity for breathtaking images. It is a poignant tragedy based on Thomas Mann's classic novella of the same name. Visconti has captured many of the essential qualities of the book and employed a superb visual style (with the assistance of the great cinematographer Pasqualino DeSantis) for a story which is essentially an interior one. It is about the struggle within the soul of a man, Gustav von Aschenbach, a composer vacationing in the Venice of 1911.In Mann's book Aschenbach was a writer, but Visconti asserted that the book had been inspired by events in the life of Gustav Mahler, whose music, mostly the haunting adagietto of his Fifth Symphony, is used as background (and foreground) music, helping create an almost tactile mood of melancholy.Dirk Bogarde plays Aschenbach, a man possessed by feelings of failure, haunted by the grief he and his wife (Marisa Berensen) shared over the death of their daughter. He is a man on the precipice of emotional collapse who finds both redemption and destruction in the contemplation of beauty. ""The creation of beauty and purity is a spiritual act."" God and composers are alike.In this film beauty becomes incarnate in the form of a young Polish boy vacationing at the same hotel, the Hotel des Bains on the Lido. The boy's stately mother is played by Silvana Mangano. The long-haired blond boy is Tadziu, aged 14, played by the Swedish Bjørn Andresen. Aschenbach is smitten by, then obsessed with, the boy's beauty, in a manner that is more spiritual than sexual, but which must also contain a good deal of sublimated sexual longing. At first he merely steals opportunities to look at the lad. They never speak. Gradually he starts to seek him out, self-destructively spurred-on by the boy's coquettishness and knowing glances. Bogarde makes the character's longing as tangibly moving as it is ultimately pathetic.All this takes place in a misty Venice dense with metaphorical gloom and a mysterious plague (cholera) carrying death to its inhabitants. In one horrifying scene a barber ""re-makes"" Aschenbach's face so that it is both a grotesque parody of youth and an ominous death mask.Visconti's skill in recreating lush period detail, to paint family-album poses of aristocracy, to make beauty seem dangerous, to underline the complexity of human psychology, are all in evidence here. The color photography by Pasqualino De Santis, and the costumes by Piero Tosi are excellent.The ending of the film is unforgettable: Gustav languishing on the beach, the Polish folk song in the background, the boy Tadziu in the water turning into an angelic apparition with extended hand. Overwhelming!I cannot imagine a better film ever being made of Mann's great and essential work.",Death in Venice
30,diane-34,"After years, I loved it far more than even the first viewing!",10,29 July 2006,"Visconti's masterpiece! I admit that I am unfamiliar with much of his work but I cannot imagine his other work surpassing this fabulous film. Last night I watched Death in Venice after an absence of about 25 years and was totally captivated by all that I saw. This captivation was a pastiche composed of many elements: The extraordinary shots directed by Visconte, primarily his love of long, languorous shots of people dining, swimming, walking and containing a significant character passing through this mass of people; the cinematographers brilliant interpretation of Visconti's shot selection; the acting by the principles without over-riding dialog and conveying the scenes complexity through facial features alone.It is true: young people watching this film for the first time must be aware that they are watching a unique film, a film that could not be made in 2006. A film whose time rests in those brief handful of years in the Sixties and early Seventies of the last century when artistic license was passed to film directors and money-men took secondary roles. As many of the recent IMDb commentator's have written, this film, in their judgment, is long, boring (too little action) and pretentious. I suppose by the standards of Hollywood pap, these comments contain merit. Unfortunately they tragically minimize the amazing beauty and depth of this work and others like it from those years.Please, if you have not seen Death in Venice, rent a copy and immerse yourself in a film and story from another time. You will be rewarded.",Death in Venice

32,billsoccer,Ode to pedophilia,3,1 July 2017,"This is a movie about a man fantasizing about a young boy. Nothing more, though woven around sights of one of the most romantic cities in the world. I see no redeeming value in this semi-autobiographical story by Thomas Mann. I can't imagine there was any other reason to write/film it than to increase sympathy for men with these feelings. Pure propaganda, unadorned by any exploration of internal thought process, which might have served to explain his (seeming) struggle. If you want to see an entertaining movie about homosexuals, check out Capote. This is simply about a mans fascination with a good-looking youth. Risking people thinking I'm being homophobic, I just can't understand the rave reviews, or even the good reviews that ignore the central tenet of the movie. I should say only tenet - there's utterly no plot and little dialog. I'd be more upset if the movie wasn't so awful boring. Btw - the 3 stars were entirely due to the shots of Venice!",Death in Venice
33,bwaynef,A pedophile fantasy,4,22 January 2011,"I never read ""Death in Venice,"" but I'm sure it concerns more than an artist's homosexual longings. Luchino Visconti's 1971 film is interested in little else. Considering that Visconti and his star, Dirk Bogarde, were both gay, that is hardly surprising. In Mann's novel, the artist is a painter. Visconti makes him a composer, an odd choice for a film maker who one would expect to relate better to another visual artist. Maybe Visconti was attempting to distance himself from the character, to make his film appear less autobiographical and less scandalous.The object of beauty with which Bogarde's composer becomes obsessed is a young boy of 15 with delicate features and a long mane of wavy blonde hair. Played by Bjorn Andresen in his film debut, he dresses in a sailor's suit through much of the film and resembles a doll. He is, indeed, an ""object"" to admire like a painting or piece of statuary. He has almost no dialogue. He is present to be observed and to occasionally acknowledge Bogarde's stares with a teasing glance. The boy is wise enough to know this man is enthralled by his beauty and seems to enjoy the power it gives him. The boy could literally bring the man to his knees. If ""Death in Venice"" was a porno film, he would, too, but this is art, you know, so the boy keeps his nice white sailor's slacks on and Bogarde communicates his passion only through longing gazes.""Death in Venice"" has an intellectual veneer, but it's really about a gay pedophile. That doesn't disqualify it from consideration as art. Indeed, sexual passion has likely inspired some of the greatest masterpieces, and when the passion is forbidden, all that pent-up desire needs an outlet. But homosexuals have never been stigmatized in the arts as they have been in other professions. As a film director, Visconti likely had many opportunities to indulge his sexual appetite that would not have been available to a closeted accountant or grocery store clerk. Still, he channeled his passions into his work. There's little doubt that Bjorn Andresen was cast as the boy who ignites Bogarde's passion because Andresen ignited Visconti's. In later years, Andresen acknowledged that Visconti had a sexual interest in him and took him to gay bars during filming.Visconti's homosexuality informs ""Death in Venice,"" but there is a larger theme even though the director reduces it to a footnote. An outbreak of cholera in Venice leads not to concerns about the artist's own health as might be expected, but to fear that it will harm the boy and wipe his beauty from the earth. The artist is also sad about the passing of his own youth and lets a barber dye his hair and powder his face to improve his appearance. Age, the inevitability of decay, etc, are what ""Death in Venice"" is supposedly about, and the symbolism in the ending is a little too obvious.The theatrical trailer included on the DVD flashes the word ""Masterpiece"" on the screen, but does not attribute it to any critic. Visconti was an artist, but that doesn't make every film he made a masterpiece. ""Death in Venice"" doesn't make it. Other than the lovely shots of Bjorn Andresen's face, the imagery makes no lasting impression, and without memorable images, all we are left with is music by Gustav Mahler accompanying an emotionally muted and ultimately shallow homosexual fantasy.Brian W. Fairbanks",Death in Venice
34,jonathanruano,Death in Venice,6,22 May 2017,"The opening of ""Death in Venice"" is masterful. Gustav von Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde) is portrayed as an over-disciplined and exhausted German composer travelling by ship to Venice. But then the film fails to live up to the pretensions of its great opening scene and becomes a story about nothing much in particular. I should emphasize the beautiful scenes in this movie, because director Luchino Visconti really does create a whole new world complete with ostentatious luxury. Yet at the centre of this world is a dull story. The film is basically about Gustav von Aschenbach's infatuation with an enigmatic Polish boy named Tadzio (Björn Andresen), which is fine except that the whole movie hangs almost entirely on this single plot point. Moreover, this infatuation amounts to Gustav becoming more and more miserable as he stalks Tadzio through the plague-ridden streets of Venice, while Tadzio gives him penetrating stares which amount to enigmatic portends. What could Tadzio be thinking? It occurred to me that Tadzio was asking himself, ""Why is this stranger following me through the streets of Venice?"" Once those types of thoughts entered my head, Gustav's behaviour is difficult to take seriously. Then Dirk Bogarde's Gustav made things a lot worse by being dull and prissy and putting white paint and rouge on his face to apparently appear like the living manifestation of death.While this absurd love story was unfolding, we are treated to flashbacks involving Gustav and his mercurial friend Alfred (Mark Burns) discussing art. Gustav opined that beauty can only come from the spirit and that the spirit cannot be accessed through the senses. Alfred countered that beauty can only be accessed through the senses, ""evil is the food of genius,"" and music is the most ambiguous art of them all transformed into a science. I am not sure what the point of these discussions are, but they seem out of place in a movie like this. Equally mystifying was watching Alfred threaten to deliver Gustav to an angry mob who had just booed his symphony.This movie is not completely lacking in interest, owing to the stylish way it was filmed. Visconti inserts the soundtrack from Mahler's third, fourth, and fifth symphonies at every conceivable opportunity, which works out pretty well. The scenes in early 20th century Venice are also elegantly filmed. We see everything from the brothels to the darkly lit corridors to the gloomy decadence of the hotels to the canals. This is a visual feast for the eyes, but sadly there is not much of a story.",Death in Venice
35,bbmtwist,Visconti and Bogarde masterpiece of passion and sensuality,10,9 June 2019,"DEATH IN VENICE (1971)Thomas Mann's novel, Death In Venice, is brought to the screen as an acclaimed masterpiece, the only change in plotting being turning Aschenbach from a writer into a composer, made to look like Mahler, whose music floods the film.It is practically a silent film, with very little dialogue, and is directed as such, with long lingering shots of faces with reflections of inner thoughts and passions. True, it could have done with a good deal of editing, as a number of scenes run on and on with no apparent purpose - the most egregious being the reprise of the strolling players at about 90 minutes into the film. The director's cut is 131 minutes, but it certainly could have done without about 11 of those minutes.It is Dirk Bogarde's best performance, a brilliant character study of a man, fastidious in his moral appropriateness, his perfection, slowly worn down by the sensuality of his passion for an angelic boy. The boy, not altogether innocent, is constantly giving him sensual, smiling glances and lingering looks. A brave film for its time, exploring the emerging homoerotic feelings of a dying man and the equally emerging homoerotic curiosity of an adolescent boy, using only facial expressions, as there is no shared dialogue between Aschenbach and Tadzio.The performance of Bogarde, the sensual direction of Visconti, the cinematography, art direction, costumes and scoring certainly deserved Oscar noms, but the Academy only recognized the costumes. The BAFTAS were more appreciative, giving awards to the Art Direction, Costumes, Cinematography and Scoring with noms to Visconti, Bogarde and the film itself.The terrible performance of Mark Burns as Aschenbach's vitriolic ""friend"" is excruciatingly bad, but luckily lasts for only a few scenes. The fourth movement (Adagietto) from Mahler's fifth symphony is used extensively throughout the film to create a perfect romantic, yet tragic, musical theme to support the yearning and the mystery of the attraction.Although set in 1911, its greatest impact for me is in its depiction of a last summer for the Belle Epoque. It could have easily been set in 1914 with the cholera plague symbolic of the death of Ferdinand in June and the outbreak of WWI I in August of that year. We watch a class system working in perfect order, the rich enjoying a summer at the beach, perfectly content and solid in the belief that their lives will go on forever in this manner, not knowing that it will all come crashing down around them in the not too distant future.A gorgeous film and one to be relished as a time capsule of a beautiful culture and way of life, which is no more.",Death in Venice
36,Shostakovich343,Death in Venice,5,7 April 2021,"Visconti's ""Death in Venice"" is one of the prettiest failures in cinema. The production was doomed from the start. Most of the action takes place in Thomas Mann's eponymous novella takes place in the protagonist's thoughts, after all. And internal monologues do not translate to film. What remains is 140 minutes of footage of a man stalking an underage boy through Venice and dropping dead. At least the title is apt.Admittedly, some original material has been added as compensation. Aschenbach's stalking excursions are interspersed with flashbacks in which he delivers a heated monologue on aesthetics. These sudden bursts of stodgily delivered lecture are hardly more involving than the long stretches of lethargy they so brusquely interrupt. The elements do not work on their own, let alone combined.Nowadays, ""Death in Venice"" is best remembered for its soundtrack, and rightly so. As the character of Aschenbach was reportedly based on Gustav Mahler, Visconti made the brilliant call of using the Adagietto from the latter's fifth symphony as a leitmotiv. The combination of the hunkering music and Visconti's luxurious Panavision cinematography is glorious, and contributed more to Mahler's popularity than any number of records did.But if the mellow music and pretty pictures make ""Death in Venice"" an object of interest to cinephiles, its story remains a failure. Instead of sitting through the ordeal, you can recreate the experience easily by putting on Mahler's fifth (twice, if you pick a swift recording) and reading the latest issue of National Geographic. Or Men's Health, for the full experience.",Death in Venice
37,donwc1996,Slow As Molasses,6,13 July 2014,"You haven't seen slow until you have seen this film. And I thought Barry Lyndon was slow. This film makes Barry Lyndon look like a runaway train. And since Mann's book was actually a novella this film is probably longer than the book it is so drawn out. But it is riveting in its own way. Visconti is never dull that's for sure. And his films are always visually stimulating. His eye for detail is unmatched, although he did overlook a couple of TV antennas in one scene, but I doubt anyone would have noticed them. Dirk Bogarde is as always absolutely wonderful and clearly exhibits what makes a star and it's making things happen without lifting a finger. He is in virtually every scene and the scenes are very long so he's on camera forever yet he manages to keep your interest because he is so interesting. The film is really about him and he does carry it brilliantly. But the original story is just too abstract for a film and they should have never made it.",Death in Venice
38,FilmSnobby,The Death of European Cinema.,10,3 April 2004,"Cinema's greatest period started in post-War Europe with Italy's Neo-Realist movement.  During the next 2 or 3 decades that followed, France's New Wavers caught everyone's attention, and there was always Bergman up there on his desolate Scandinavian island somewhere, making bitter masterpieces.  But in 1971, Luchino Visconti brought the art-form to full circle, geographically speaking, with his miraculous work  *Death in Venice*, which might as well be called  *The Death of Europoean Cinema*.  After the Sixties wound down, so did the great European filmmakers, who, with some exceptions, generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats  (Coppola, Scorsese, & Co.).  This movie absolutely feels like a grand summing-up, not just of Visconti's particular obsessions, but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies. And rest assured, you will find no sterner task-master than the Visconti revealed here.  He's not playing to the crowd, folks:  either you get behind him and follow along, or you get left behind.  The pacing is a challenge: slow, but never without emotional weight.  ""Incidents""  are few and far between, but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturm-und-drang cosmos.We will probably never be in such rarefied company again, in terms of the movies:  one of the century's great writers who inspired the tale  (Thomas Mann), one of the greatest filmmakers directing it  (Visconti), one of the greatest actors in the lead role  (Dirk Bogarde), and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background, Gustav Mahler's 5th Symphony.  Taking full advantage of Mahler's ability to inspire Romanticism in even the most cynical breast, Visconti changes the main character, Aschenbach, into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer, even making Bogarde up to LOOK like Mahler  (geeky mustache, specs, shaggy hair, duck-like walk).  Bogarde, by the way, delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies:  it's a largely silent performance, and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance -- a difficult trick without mugging like Chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse.Cinema just doesn't get better than this.  I'll ignore the complaints from the Ritalin-addicts out there who say that it's too slow, but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced.  The flashbacks fit neatly within the movie's thematic concerns  (i.e., which is the better path to aesthetic perfection:  passion or discipline?), and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers.  (Of course, some viewers will sleep through this movie, anyway.)  A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful, dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something.  And what it's mostly about is suffering:  Romantic  (capital R)  suffering, in particular. As a suffering Romantic himself, Visconti knew whereof he spoke.  If for nothing else, see  *Death in Venice*  for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending, with Bogarde's jet-black hair-dye dripping off of his sweaty, dying head and onto his chalk-white face.  Meanwhile, off in the distance, young Tadzio, the object of Bogarde's dying desire, stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture.  The climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about:  love, lust, beauty, loss, the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life, and cold death in the midst of warm, sunny beauty.  *Death in Venice*  is a miraculous work of art.    [DVD tip:  as with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece  *The Damned*, I recommend that you turn the English subtitles ON while watching this movie.  It's ostensibly in English, but the DVD's sound seems muddy and there's a lot of Italian spoken during the film, anyway.]",Death in Venice

40,Balthazar-5,In the mood... & Mahler,8,7 January 2004,"Emotion is a very fragile thing in the cinema. Indeed, it might be argued that the greatest responsibility of a filmmaker is the maintainance of an appropriate mood throughout the film.  Visconti had well learned this simple truth by the time he came to make Death in Venice. It is well-known that Thomas Mann was himself in Venice and saw the vision of loveliness who is Tadeusz in both the book and the film. Visconti takes Mann's novella and opens it out in one way, while closing it up in another. Ultimately this is a story of a personal crisis, which is reflected in an aesthetic one. Visconti makes his composer/conductor a representation of romantic aesthetics who is intellectually downtrodden, but achieves a kind of personal epiphany. It is interesting to muse how much Visconti himself identified with von Aschenbach.It is also interesting to think how much the film relies on Bogarde's acting - few films need such a central performance to carry them.And this brings me back to mood, and emotion. Death in Venice works because, through the very skilfully controlled visuals and the anchor of Bogarde's performance, we really believe in this unbelievable story.The cinema has worked its magic in spite of the circumstances... And we are left with images ... a steamer appearing out of the mist, a grotesque banjo-player, and most of all a staggeringly beautiful boy on a beach, that we will not easily be able to forget. It is not about inappropriate obsession, it is about love and beauty, and, as someone who cannot abide the artificial injection of any kind of un-necessary sexuality into cinema, I find it completely captivating.But would it have worked without Mahler?

41,bob-790-196018,A Movie with Some Great Sequences that Is Ulimately Pretentious and Empty,6,4 March 2011,"There is much to love in the first half of this film. The opening sequence, where Dirk Bogarde as Gustav von Aschenbach is shown in closeup aboard a boat headed for Venice, with glimpses of the city looming in the background, is masterful and helps us to focus on his isolation. This sense of being outside the mainstream of life becomes dramatically clear in the subsequent ensemble scenes at the grand resort hotel on the Lido.These are great scenes, giving us a portrait of resort life among the haute bourgeoisie in the years just before World War I, a way of life that never survived that war. Visconti creates a crowded, busy canvas, full of life, and then uses his camera searchingly, showing us life as viewed by von Aschenbach, the lone traveler from Germany. We see masses of people enjoying before-dinner refreshments in a great hall of the hotel; then watch them on the beach; and then--in a strange and wonderful scene--see them on the terrace being entertained by a ragtag Italian minstrel group.During these scenes, von Aschenbach is increasingly attracted by the beauty of the androgynous boy Tadzio. At first this is intriguing. The boy is with his mother, governess, and siblings. He is aware of his attractiveness to von Aschebach and cannot help showing this awareness, though at the same time it is clear that there is a limit to how far this well-brought-up and strictly supervised boy will lead him on.And that's where the movie becomes slow and even tiresome. Over and over we see von Aschenbach trailing after Tadzio and his family, longing for him and indeed in love with him. To give the second half of the movie a sense of direction, we are made to become increasingly aware that a plague has reached the city, and before long we understand that von Aschenbach will fall victim to it. And so he does. If the plague has some symbolic value, it never becomes clear.The greatest flaw in the movie is the series of abrupt interruptions of the story with flashbacks showing von Aschenbach back in Germany, involved in fierce debates with a colleague about ""art"" versus ""life,"" ""spirit"" versus ""the senses,"" and so on. Clearly these are meant to inject some thematic sense into the main story in Venice, but the debates are almost ludicrously simplistic and the interruptions for them are at best distracting.Is this a film about an aging man's longing for youth? An intellectual's plunge into the realm of the senses? A respectable man's descent into pederastry? Who knows? I'll have to re-read Mann's novella, which I last read a long time ago, to find out the real story.",Death in Venice
42,peru1-595-630106,Wonderful attention to period detail but doesn't cover logic of story well.,4,4 June 2013,I remember the novella as being realistic intelligent and moving. This movie is very slow moving and doesn't capture the logic of the story well. The flash backs are very poorly done. The pseudo intellectual dialogs about the nature of art etc... are irritating and trite. Thomas Mann was too intelligent to have had much of that nonsense--or it was taken completely naked out of context making the actors look like pseudo intellectual idiots--the over dramatic poor acting in these scenes doesn't help. Terrible and this includes basically all the flashbacks-- but especially those featuring his musical cohort in Germany--what terrible direction.Knowing the story however I was able to enjoy the re-creation of 1910 Venice which was very well done and must have cost a fortune--just for the costumes.Like another reviewer stated so well the actor who plays Tadzio (Bjorn Andresen) does not capture the character in the book...he just isn't handsome enough is basically the problem too thin too feminine. The book Tadzio is Adonis like and proud. Like wise the actor playing Von Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde) tries his best but you don't get the convincing story the book gives you of his vortex like descent into various humiliations as he becomes infatuated with the 15 year old Tadzio. He dyes his hair puts on rouge make-up to look younger. Dirk Bogarde has the opposite problem he is too young and good looking to need these sorts of humiliating disasters.The movie tries to convey that Tadzio represent the muse of art or some such nonsense (Aschenback was in love with the intellectual idea of beauty and art)... Thomas Mann was well schooled in Freud and the book clearly indicates the much more believable carnal nature of Aschenbach's desires.READ THE BOOK AND BUY MAHLER'S 5th Symphony instead.DO NOT RECOMMEND UNLESS YOU HAVE RECENTLY READ THE BOOK.,Death in Venice

44,desperateliving,9/10,9,3 January 2005,"I can't quite explain why I find this so alluring and ""The Leopard"" not; it may be because the focus here is on all that was great with that film, those intimate moments that Visconti can render so magnificently. Like that film, it has a majestically slow pace, but this time it isn't overlong. It's the kind of film where nothing happens but twenty minutes passes like that. I think that must be due in part to the way the film deals with flashbacks that act as their own mini-story. Like ""The Leopard,"" it has a sympathetic lead who brings out the same kind of worn pathos -- though Bogard's performance is more willing to open itself to being unlikable, especially in look: he has a really stupid grin that's easy to dislike. It's often quite beautiful in the quiet moments. It's the opulence of Visconti's films, the grandeur of the ball scenes, that I find tedious, as they exchange individual clarity with mass precision. But here, that is part of the point -- Gustav surrounded by a visual din.The way in which the object of Gustav's affection is introduced to us is quite brilliant -- the camera shows a girl, girl, girl, then this beautiful, feminine-featured boy. It's like an allusion to Shakespeare's sonnets, and it doesn't feel heavy-handed. (It's not until the camera views Tadzio fully, pulls back and we see his long, slender legs, that we realize he is not a boy, but an adolescent -- at first we're forced to question Gustav's attraction in an uncomfortable way; Visconti must have known that, and he doesn't shy away from it.) Visconti is extremely patient with Gustav; we get a sense of the man, we know him. It's a largely silent performance, and when he does open his mouth it's to spew venom; no wonder he wants the angelic, open-featured boy to project himself onto. There's a difference with Tadzio (we never know him, just as we never know a handful of Fellini grotesques; but that's because his life is another, its own film), but it's not as flirtatious as it's been made to seem (there is one scene, however, where he twirls around a pole that's too much). Tadzio isn't necessarily leading him on -- he's looking at him; Visconti just zooms in is all.The film doesn't detail Gustav as being gay -- Tadzio isn't even really male, he's a prettified version of a boy (delicate, pale, wispy, with golden locks) that everyone seems to love (including one gorgeous, slightly older young man who he wrestles with). The closest they go to showing what could be understood as a reference to Gustav's homosexuality is the famous barber scene, which unlocks his repressed vanity.It isn't totally successful -- the whole section with Alfred is a waste, and some unnecessary scenes, people carrying bags in long shot, could have been excised. Some parts are heavy-handed, such as when Gustav's boat pulls in and rowdy boys pass him by -- the looks on his face are too obvious. (But during the same scene Gustav throws a fit, wanting a new rower, something so unexplainable that it makes up for it.) But there are some scenes -- touching for the first time -- that build up a remarkable, quiet intensity. Tadzio repeating a piano song again and again, the notes quivering in the air, may be the best example of the anxiety the film has. There is one discussion that contains a debate I'm especially interested: Can art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses, or does it have to go beyond them? (We can consider Tarkovsky, who esteems both Visconti and Mann, to be the prime example of someone going beyond mere sensory sensations.) I think this one manages to do both. 9/10",Death in Venice

46,tsf-1962,somber but sumptuous,10,31 December 2006,"Are sea side resorts the sad, dreary places they're always depicted as in movies and novels? Certainly this movie, along with the near-contemporary ""Don't Look Now"" depicts Venice as a particularly squalid and decadent tourist trap (for a more light-hearted approach, see ""Just Married"" with Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy). Having never been to Venice I can't say for sure, but it does make a perfect setting for this somber but sumptuous spectacle from Luchino Visconti, one of the great stylists of world cinema. Having seen the movie I now wish I had gotten around to reading the Thomas Mann novella it's based on (which also inspired an opera by Sir Benjamin Britten). Since I don't know the back story and the movie has little in the way of plot or exposition, I'm left wondering about Aschenbach (Dirk Bogarde)'s obsession with young Tadzio. Is he a homosexual? A pedophile? Or is his longing for the beautiful youth something more innocent? Perhaps Tadzio reminds him of what he could have been and now knows he never will be. Those who complain of the slow pace of this movie should stick to car crashes and kung-fu: at 2 hours and 15 minutes it's not particularly long, and it moves at a leisurely but hardly sluggish pace. The film benefits from the ravishing music of Gustave Mahler, on whom Aschenbach's character is clearly based.

Brilliantly brought to the screen in 1971, Luchino Visconti's Death In Venice is a meditation on art and death. The soundtrack is ethereally hypnotic. The film's lead character is based on Austro-Bohemian composer Gustav Mahler. Gustav, in his pursuit of transcendence and tranquility, is gradually consumed by a mystifying cholera epidemic. Death In Venice details the self-evisceration of an individual's and a nation's proud ideals. Not reconciling such ideals with the demonic is a grave error. The dying lead character spies a symbol of perfection in the sun-kissed Adriatic. However, he's either unable or unwilling to see the specter of fascism and two World Wars over the horizon. Death In Venice, abounding in symbolism, pulls the viewer into a nebulous world of art, beauty, decay, and demise.",Death in Venice
55,msultan,ignores important aspects of the novella,7,11 June 2004,"I'm not sure where to start with this. In short, it was a disappointing movie. Having taught the novella, I was aware that it would be a hard story to turn into a movie. The movie has a couple of interesting lines (mainly between Alfred and Aschenbach) but it doesn't represent the debate on art that basically shapes the novella. For one, I was expecting an older Aschenbach and a younger Tadzio. In the book, Tadzio is fourteen, but he is described as pure, ideal, innocent, whereas in the movie he reeks of sexuality and is a tease. He is an accomplice to Aschenbach, he always looks back at him, almost provokingly. In the book, it is Aschenbach who steals glances at the boy. As for Aschenbach, I imagined something closer to the professor-turned-clown in The Blue Angel (based on a story by Thomas Mann's brother Heinrich) than this forty-year old with hardly any gray hair. In all fairness, I do think that Dirk Bogarde did a good job, but either someone else should have done that, or he should have made to look older at the beginning. I know that the discovery of homosexuality is important to the story, but the movie minimizes the talk about art and the duality between the Apollonian and Dyonisian inspirations and focuses instead on Aschenbach's obsession of Tadzio and does not justify it. I liked the fact that Mahler's music was used, because ultimately he did inspire Mann to write his story. I'm not sure turning Aschenbach into a musician was a particularly good move. Or the creation of Alfred who I don't remember in the book.And one thing that really got to me was the sound and how it did not match the actors' lips. I was wondering if it was dubbed because I expected it to be in Italian. But then I remembered that each Italian movie I have watched has this problem. It just bothers me because these directors (Fellini is the other person I'm thinking of) are supposed to epitomize perfection in Italian cinema, and here are their characters laughing without sound, then you hear a noise that doesn't correspond to their faces (I'm thinking of the scenes when Aschenbach almost collapses and starts laughing. This scene could/should have been the strongest, but it was annoying instead).",Death in Venice
56,stefan-144,"Not topping the book, but what scenes and what sounds!",9,7 January 2003,"From the first to the last scene of the movie, director Visconti excels at his art, to the extent that the movie is ensured to remain as a cultural treasure for only God knows how long. It is perfection - as a movie, that is, but the story has some minor shortcomings.Thomas Mann's novel is also a perfect piece of art, so of course it is impossible to bring into another media. Visconti follows the story pretty much, and it is only when he allows himself to deviate slightly, that the transition falters. And no matter how wonderful the scenery is, the tension in the air between the characters, the hundreds of subtle signals and allegories, the almost unbearably heightened serving of Mahler's music - still, the minute anomalies in the plot disturb me.Maybe I'm just a victim of man's desire to flaw the flawless. Nevertheless, I will offer one example, which I regard as crucial.WARNING: SPOILERSIn Mann's story, Aschenbach eats the strawberries which probably contain the disease that will kill him, after giving up his frustrated chase of the boy Tadzio in Venice. Unable to catch one delight, he settles for another - which poisons him. It is very subtle in the book, but it is there. The forbidden fruit, of sorts, but more a sign of him surrendering life itself.In Visconti's film, he also eats strawberries, but in a rather insignificant scene by the beach. The chase in Venice ends in a much more melodramatic way. It works, too, but lacks some subtlety, indeed, and also the multi-layered symbolism, giving food for thought.But that's all forgiven, when the film allows us to feast on beautiful sceneries, faces and constellations, and certainly as many other symbols as we can possibly digest - the last gesture of Tadzio, standing in the water, being the equally sublime and mysterious finale.",Death in Venice
57,Quinoa_Chris_Kirk,Beauty and shame,9,9 March 2021,"Death in Venice is a sumptuously beautiful Technicolor immersion into pesilential Venice. Dirk Bogarde gives a lot in his performance as the isolated composer Gustav von Aschenbach. He is holidaying alone in Venice to recover from the overwhelming stresses of his life, particularly of being massively uptight and self-denying, while simultaneously giving of himself through the committed and considered perfection of his music.Flashbacks of passionate conversations with a friend spell out explicitly how we are to interpret the present scenes in Venice. There is no separation between the man and his music; he expects perfection of himself, moral purity, and no corruption through a mere pleasure of the senses. He dreams of a spiritual beauty that is pure and perfect. And he discovers this in the beautiful form of a teenage boy he sees in his Venice hotel, holidaying with his family, the magnificently beautiful Björn Andérsen. He observes this boy from afar but does not dare to approach him. Tadzio notices his attention and is as captivated by his gaze as Gustav is captivated to gaze upon him. But, as we are so clearly told in the flashback philosophical conversations, his engagement with life is as a detached observer.Bogarde's performance is excruciating in its precision and commitment to communicating, through almost no dialogue and often merely sitting alone, the painful self-loathing expressed as pomposity and cowardice. Gustav is horrified in the beginning to encounter a painted and flamboyant queen who addresses him on equal terms, as if to a fellow queen. He does not want to humiliate himself with such shameless abandon.Tadzio plays with his attention and the power it gives him, but Gustav cannot act, cannot place himself on the line, cannot risk to feel so much, cannot allow himself the potential pleasure promised by engagement with this beautiful young man fluttering about in front of him like a butterfly. I suppose this self-loathing and self-denial speaks to a very specific queer experience that would have been all too common at the time, and only somewhat less so today. The expression of queer desire and admiration of beauty is more permissible in Western societies today, but the admiration of the beauty of adolescent boys, is less permissible perhaps.Gustav's struggle is as much present in the languorous gaze of the camera, its subtle movements and carefully editing, as it is in Bogarde's performance.While I find it unpleasant to identify with Bogarde's character in very personal and humiliating ways the film remains a work of beauty and sympathy, with the squalid and dangerous beauty of Venice and the as-yet-uncorrupted beauty of Tadzio, perhaps equally dangerous.",Death in Venice
58,auberus,"A haunting piece of cinema, a true emotional experience, a masterpiece",8,12 July 2004,"Luchino Visconti's 'Death in Venice' is one of the most misunderstood masterpieces of cinema. Based on Thomas Mann's 1913 classic novella of the same name, the film not only capture the quintessential of the novel but also reinforce a powerful questioning through superb visuals. Adapted by Mr. Visconti himself who decided to focus on the Venice chapter only as well as to modify the occupation of the main protagonist, Gustav von Aschenbach who becomes a music composer (highly inspired by the composer Mahler), the film was also inspired by other Thomas Mann's novel like 'Doctor Faustus' or by Marcel Proust's writing. Often reduced and presented as a decadent film in which homosexuality and pedophilia are the main themes, the novel like the movie deals in fact with a much more complex and powerful dynamic.Indeed the film is based on an equation between Death and Beauty as an aphorism for Perfection and in which the results is Time (or the lack of it). Perfection, Beauty is a chimer, pursuing it is pursuing Death as Time is passing by. At first von Aschenbach does not understand why the perfection of the form in his musical composition does not lead to the perfection of his symphony and therefore lose himself in a quest for Beauty following the young Tadzio as not only a symbol for this ultimate Beauty / Perfection but also as the Mask of Death. In this Venice, marked by Death and cursed by the plague, the Time is running out and the fascinating quest for Perfection finally appears to be a dangerous game to play.All the notions that build up to the main questioning are revealed during this quest for Perfection and this race against Death. The notion of Urgency reinforced by an avoidable sorrow as Von Aschenbach realizes he is getting old in the hair dresser scene. The notion of isolation right from the beginning emphases by the personality of Aschenbach himself and showed by Visconti as someone cold and rigid and therefore alone. The notion of Desire which leads to the understanding of the main questioning: for Aschenbach, Perfection is reached through hard work it is a consequence not a fact. The Young Tadzio blows away this certitude. Does von Aschenbach desire Tadzio or is he fascinated by what he represents: Perfect Beauty?The challenge of Luchino Visconti was to apply a superb cinematography and a precise narrative method to a film that in nature deals with complex concepts. By succeeding in this task Mr. Visconti delivers a haunting piece of cinema, a true emotional experience, a masterpiece.",Death in Venice

62,votarus4,Stalking the Abyss,9,25 March 2004,"Visconti's Death in Venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made. While watching, we acknowledge we are in the hands of a visionary genius. Endlessly opulent Death in Venice surely is; but in other important ways, it's an unsatisfying film. Thomas Mann writes with contempt and from a distance of von Aschenbach's literary career and output; of his imperious manner, his layer-upon-layer of programmed, self-conscious behavior. When Tadzio appears and obsession arises, it's evident that Aschenbach hasn't the slightest idea who he is beneath his Gilded-Age trappings and carefully lived life. In fact, upon seeing Tadzio, the 'Solitary,' as Mann sometimes calls him, splits in two. Aschenbach No. 1 absorbs the sight of a beautiful 14-year old boy, then attempts to intellectually process the giddy jolt in blood pressure as he would a work of art - a 'divine' work of art. But Aschenbach No. 2, emerges as a stalker who takes control of, then replaces, the rational Aschenbach No. 1. Like the original Aschenbach, his sexual-doppelganger is mortified to make human contact with the object of his obsession - and thus Tadzio remains a far-off ideal. Thomas Mann has no mercy for this game. Every shred of self knowledge comes too strong and too late; the excitement of sexual flush is too great to resist. That Venice is gripped by disease means nothing to Aschenbach - except that his game now has higher stakes. When he finally whispers beneath his breath 'I love you,' he knows that all is lost, and the abyss awaits. Is any of this filmable? Perhaps, and Visconti creates a visual feast impossible to look away from. But there are errors: He and Dirk Bogarde create Aschenbach as sympathetic; Mann, again, did not. Aschenbach's POV dominates the film and we are expected to identify. But nowhere on screen is there a man being torn apart from within. Bogarde toggles between the sublimely controlled and the ridiculously temperamental with ease - but what's underneath? Bogard's reactive performance has no mooring. Mann writes a character who is, in his imagination, doing the Dance of the Seven Veils, all too aware of the consequences such freedom invites, yet unable, unwilling to resist. Also, Visconti's screenplay creates a character not in the original - Alfred, a friend of Aschenbach's - to dramatize Mann's discussion of Art and Artists. These scenes are badly written disasters, and the actor who portrays Alfred is difficult to watch. Also, Visconti's Aschenbach is a Gilded-Age Teutonic composer, which I think works for the film; and the symphonies of Mahler substitute for Aschenbach's novels. Mahler's great music unfortunately is badly recorded and very badly played. So Death in Venice, as Visconti hands it to us, is not the complete success it might have been, but as a purely visual experience its power cannot be denied. All students of film, especially cinematography, will want to take a look.",Death in Venice

The recent DVD release reminded me how great a film it is and how much passion and pain it carries.In many ways it is better than the novel because by making Aschenbach a musician, Visconti honors the Mahler soundtrack and made an almost silent beautiful film where the images and music speak for themselves.
Like the great silent films, in DEATH IN VENICE we SEE that Tadzio and his family are beautiful, that Aschenbach is bitter and FEEL that death is in the air. No one need say it.Even in sexy 1971 the paedophile elements were obvious(and funny), but DEATH IN VENICE is not really about that. Tadzio may be a tease but he is no sex object.

64,Boris-57,Forget the book. Filmmaking at full capacity here.,10,8 December 2000,"Personally, I can only but agree with Stephen-12: indulge. There's really no point in trying to 'capture' this film. I like movies where nothing (explicitly) happens. Herzog's 'Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes' has got the same nothingness, though that movie is less convincing, since the climaxes are rather in the beginning of the story, so Herzog had to focus on nature versus Kinski. Morte a Venezia is wholly different though, since it has several climaxes, turns, etc. In fact, from the point where Aschenbach's luggage is lost, the movie almost 'rushes' to its grand finale (his final grains of sand begin running through the hourglass after the moment of bliss where he fantasises about warning the Polish family and caressing Tadzio's hair).You can, if you want to, seek some real clues/symbols in this one (his trying to leave behind his luggage from the moment he arrives, the pointing Tadzio at the end, the fact that in the whole film content and form are completely in sinc), but there's no point in doing this: it won't make the film better or worse, since its force lies in the whole storyline's undertow, which is never made explicit. Tons of history, decaying Europe, the end of the 'romantic era' as we've come to know it, which has proven to be only the beginning of it (individual emotions & expression are more important now than they ever were). But wait, now I myself am beginning to develop the one minor (tiny) flaw of the film: the 'let's talk about art'-parts. Now there's one thing never to do. I myself believe it could have been expressed by other means. Furthermore, I believe it becomes already very clear in the rest of the film.I don't like explicit films. I can read books, so I don't want a storyline that speaks merely to my rationale. I prefer films that you cannot explain in words, but only in film (Lynch's Lost Highway, Weir's Picknick at Hanging Rock and Roeg's Man Who fell To Earth also belong in this category), for then, and then only, it has a reason to exist as film and not merely as a book. So what about Thomas Mann's novella? I've never read it, but forget about it! The movie gives a different point of view: it says things you can never say in a book. It uses the movie-art to make you feel, through images and music, the same thing that Mann made you feel, using text. Equally brilliant, but different worlds.",Death in Venice
65,mbruce007,Bogarde/Visconti at their artistic best!,8,17 December 2020,"There are few films, I imagine, as picturesque as Italian director, Luchino Visconti's Death In Venice, based upon the novella by German writer, Thomas Mann. This is a film that could be described as one long series of paintings, permeated with deep and meaningful dialogue - an open-ended essay, perhaps, that reflects on the meaning of life; death; and art.The ever-dependable Dirk Bogarde (most famous perhaps, to his own personal and artistic detriment, for his work on the light-hearted Rank Organisation comedies of the 50s and 60s) pulls out all the stops in his deadly serious performance of the protagonist, Gustav von Aschenbach, something of an unsung musical genius, who travels to Venice, Italy, to convalesce after a period of great stress which has weakened his heart. Aschenbach is an awkward, solitary figure, a people-watcher who settles into the background, haunted by his past, flashbacks including the unexplained death of his daughter and the harsh criticism of his colleague on his philosophy of music and the essence of art, and beauty. He is tired of life's petty inconveniences and distracts himself with the contemplation of a boy, a fellow holidaymaker called Tadzio (Bjorn Andresen), by whom he is completely mesmerized.I have read the novella and, although some critics have argued that Aschenbach has a homosexual love for the boy, I think this is too easy an inference. To Aschenbach, Tadzio is youthful beauty made flesh, something that he longs to possess in his old, rather decrepit condition. Aschenbach's physical and emotional condition is made worse by the presence of Cholera in Venice, a fact which is being kept from him and the unwitting tourists. Upon learning the truth, Aschenbach is eager to warn Tadzio's family of the ""pestilence"" that has gripped the city.Given the film's title, there are no illusions as to what happens in the end. I don't wish to say more for fear of spoiling the film for others, except that the end scene is incredibly moving, an indelible moment in cinema history, courtesy of Bogarde. The direction and acting are masterful, as is the cinematography by Pasquelino de Santis. Moreover, the film has some of the most beautiful classical music I've ever heard, particularly the recurring music from Symphony No.5 by Gustav Mahler.It is curious how, in many ways, the character of Aschenbach is a reflection of Bogarde himself, who led a private life, of which he was very protective. Perhaps there was a sort of empathy that attracted him to the role. Some viewers may find the repeated close-ups and tracking shots, particularly of Tadzio, tedious, but one cannot deny, as a whole, that the film is its own work of art.",Death in Venice

'Morte a Venezia' was shot over 30 years ago, and it portrays a period even further back, at the beginning of the twentieth century.Life was slow then, compared to now. People were supposed to behave in a certain way, hiding their true emotions even from themselves. Director Visconti and Dirk Bogarde, the leading actor, admirably succeed in showing how the aging composer Von Aschenbach discovers his romantic interest in a young boy. For a man like Von Aschenbach, in his time, this must have been a shock too powerful to come to terms with. We see his inner struggle, mostly on the face of Bogarde, against the beautiful backdrop of Venice and accompanied by the most wonderful music, composed by Gustav Mahler.This movie is slow, there is no denying it. No special effects, car chases or fights to keep the audience pinned to their seats. No perverted sex scenes either; the interaction between man and boy is limited to stolen glances from afar and the occasional smile.So, basically, nothing much happens in this movie?

The music that occupies what otherwise would be silence during the film is finely chosen. I read the book first and felt disinterested in it. I watched this film and acquired a new respect for the book. Björn Andrésen is reminiscent of the Grecian ideal of boyish beauty. Though the subject matter--an older man in love (lust?) with an adolescent boy--is somewhat unsettling, ""Death in Venice"" has none of the exploitation of books/films like ""Lolita"", where a child becomes the pawn of an older, more powerful adult man. Gustave can only admire and long from afar. And unlike Lolita, Tadzio is an admired and unattainable ideal. Unfortunately for girls, they have yet to be idealized and respected in film.",Death in Venice
70,pandora8,There are no spoilers for this movie because nothing happens,1,8 June 2003,"I was entertained to see that some of the reviews here were topped with **SPOILERS** the joke in my family is that the only part of this movie that isn't given away on the back of the box, is given away in the title. Perhaps I am just a dense American 17-year-old who wouldn't know art if it bit me in the leg, but I prefer movies that have at least some words. This movie makes the second half of 2001: A Space Odyssey down right chatty. This movie is just so slow it isn't even art, it is merely boring. We follow this creepy guy who is following this boy around Venice. The end was incomprehensible until I read the end of book.

Perhaps, because i never imagined that a plot like this or a film with so few words would convey all this poetry. The true poetry and aristocracy of human passions and obsession. Bogard is amazing and needless to say that Venice is utilised as a perfect scenery: dark, sinking and dreary just like Bogard's soul.

72,Mandyjam,Tragic idyll,10,10 September 2005,"How beautiful is the city of Venice! And how many poets and painters have sought to capture it with longing and adoration! We go to Venice to see the views, cool and precisely delineated as Canaletto. When we think of Venice we see the Piazza, with the onion domes and pinnacles of San Marco, right ahead. San Giorgo's, across the water. Santa Maria della Salute from the Accademia. But this movie does not present the Venice of Canaletto but of Turner, Whistler, Monet and Lionel Lindsay. It is a vision, a dream of haze and heat through which the sun sparks on water. Turner was here in this movie, with his atmosphere. Monet came with his palette of sun-bleached colour. Lindsay, the great Australian engraver marked the courts and stairs and archways with his light and shade. And Whistler, the absolute master of composition, inspires the camera which angles down, giving an intensity, an almost voyeuristic view of every scene. Like a Whistler painting, everything is in its place. Move one potted hydrangea or one newspaper and the design disintegrates and falls to pieces. A beach attendant runs across the sand. His footprints complete a composition that has been waiting for them.This is a film so perfect, so satisfying in what it reveals and so tantalising in what it allows to remain just beyond. The boy with the light on his hair and his unassailable androgynous beauty is one with the city itself. It is the most visually exquisite movie I have ever experienced.",Death in Venice
73,edmund-marlowe,Not quite flawless,9,31 July 2014,"Some others here have written so eloquently and fully about this film's many virtues that I see no point in saying more about them. I shall instead say why I find it not quite flawless, but first I shall underline my appreciation of it by observing I love this film despite being intensely bored by some acclaimed films with little dialogue or action. Mostly I think this must come down to the film being such a rich visual treat, but hearing that some find it boring despite that, I wonder if this might not be a rare case where it is a great advantage to have read the novella first, as I did, for Mann's description of Aschenbach's developing and conflicting emotions is absolutely masterful. Perhaps this helps one feel as Aschenbach feels more than one could just from Bogarde's excellent acting.Visconti allowed himself more than two hours to bring to life a very short novel. There was thus none of the usual necessity to cut any of the novel, and since the latter is a masterpiece, every reason to be faithful to it. Nothing that matters has been cut and the film is generally faithful. Nevertheless, its only slight flaws come from being not faithful enough.The main change in the story is that Aschenbach is changed from a writer to a musician. The reasons are understandable and I don't think it matters much except that Visconti made it the basis for a series of flashbacks in which Aschenbach has slightly corny debates about the purpose of musical creation. I find these tiresome distractions.A lesser flaw for me is the choice of 16-year-old Björn Andrésen to play 14-year-old Tadzio. I realise from the numerous superlative remarks made about his beauty that most will disagree with me on this. I agree with others it was critical to the film's success that Tadzio's actor be beautiful and I can appreciate Andrésen's beauty enough to understand how Visconti's choice succeeded. Though personally I find him too pallid (and his hair too '70s for an otherwise wonderfully authentic depiction of 1911), my objection is not that he was not beautiful enough, but that it would have been easy and better to find an equally beautiful 14-year-old to play the role. There is quite a difference between boys of 14 and 16 and Mann had his reasons for depicting Tadzio as looking 14. Andrésen's rather feminine appearance for his age is a poor substitute for the more natural androgyny of 14. I think Mann's choice of 14 was intended both for the broad appeal of this quality and in considered juxtaposition to Aschenbach's age: the one near the beginning of his romantic sensibility while the other was at its end. Much to his credit, Visconti did set out to find a younger boy, so he was not making the ignoble concession to social correctness other directors have made under similar circumstances, and I would not mention it if the film was not otherwise so nearly perfect.As many appear still to be unaware of it, it may be interesting to mention that Death in Venice is partly a true story. Mann having already decided to write a story about a great writer who succumbs to passion for a youngster and to base the writer physically on the recently deceased composer Mahler, the rest of the story fell into place in detail when he arrived in Venice and promptly fell in love with a boy; in his own words, ""nothing was invented."" Gilbert Adair wrote a book on this called The Real Tadzio, exploring also the life of Wladyslaw Moes, who claimed to be the real boy (which I doubt for reasons I have explained in a review of it).Edmund Marlowe, author of Alexander's Choice, a story of similar but requited love, www.amazon.com/dp/1481222112",Death in Venice
74,aveilbrief,Breathtaking beauty... after two long and disappointing hours,6,6 June 2005,"I had high hopes when I switched on my DVD-player, but unfortunately, this was a disappointing experience. The film is simply dragging on for too long, there is hardly any development in the characters, and after 3/4 of the film I had definitely had it with Von Aschenbach's yearning for the little boy. Another flaw - in my opinion - is the excessive use of the Mahler symphonies by Visconti, probably to compensate the lack of drama in the film itself. After some time it didn't move me anymore, but started to bored me. And what's the use of the discussions between Von Aschenbach and his friend on the 'artistic genius and the necessity of evil in art', and on so on? I failed to see the relevance of it in the story. And why does Visconti merely tell about an epidemic rather than show it, apart from some smoldering fires? I liked other Visconti-films - like Ossesione, Ludwig, L'innocente, and perhaps even La Terra Trema - far more than Death in Venice. But still... after more than two hours my patience was rewarded by an image of stunning beauty. Von Aschenbachs attempts to look youthful, in order to get closer to Tadzio, are all in vain. He looks pathetic in his beach chair, with the hair-dye slowly running out over his cheek. Tadzio slowly walks away from him, into the calm sea, then stretches his arm, pointing his finger in the air. In a last effort, Von Aschenbachs imitates Tadzio's gesture, and perishes. This scene finally expresses what 'Death in Venice' is about: the elusiveness of youth and juvenile beauty.",Death in Venice
75,williambriggs,He's come a long way from 'Doctor at Large',8,6 November 2003,"The greatest tragedy man faces is that, capable so often of the divine he settles for the banal.From this fact does so much great tragedy emerge. Death in Venice is one of very few films with the patience and bravery to tackle this fact head-on.It confronts the human eye with beauty and inspiration in their two most inevitable human forms-self denial and decay. Undoubtedly this is the greatest film to have no discernable influence on mainstream cinema. Its austerely refined look, echoey sound, mixture of unsubtitled languages, and highly challenging themes being impossible to copy: as much an accident of its peculiar production as of the vision of its director. The central performance, at once rigid, aroused, and vulnerable in the face of expression and decadence highlights Bogarde as if not the best British actor of his generation then certainly the most adventurous.

I enjoy ""art movies"" and am a great fan of French Cinema so understand the need for slow pacing to properly set a mood and tell a story. This movie was slow for the sake of being slow. When it did actually attempt to movie the story forward it did so in such a convoluted manner that by the time you figured out what was happening it was over. I enjoy symbolism in a movie as long as it is meaningful and relates to the action of the movie. Having a dying man be made up in full makeup and hair dye to attract the attention of a young boy and then having the same dye run down his face as he is dying on the beach was not a good use of symbolism. The most enjoyable part of this movie was the beautiful music that was used. I especially enjoyed the acappella singing on the beach near the end of the movie.

79,daveedrenaud,One of the greatest films,10,6 November 2017,"I must admit that on the surface Death in Venice seems to have a rather troubling, unpleasant plot. An old man follows a teenage boy for most of the movie. Let's pretend that we don't know anything about Mann's book and we dived straight into this film on television. Death in Venice is a lesson to avoid writing stories off as what you think it means or is about. There's much more going on beneath the surface here. If you don't relate to our lead character, who looks rather lost in Venice... then you should at least appreciate the absolutely incredible cinematography and the way the music Mahler fits into it. This is one of the best uses of classical music to pictures you will see after Stanley Kubrick's work on 2001 and a Clockwork Orange. Yet, this movie has a level of sophistication that you might compare more to Barry Lyndon.Okay, moving away from Kubrick, Visconti is his own artist, reaching levels typical of the greats of Italian art. Many won't agree with me because this film might not be their cup of tea for several reasons. There's some really long scenes here with seemingly not much point to further a plot. But that's not the style of Death in Venice. It's all about mood, atmosphere, often all the background people and fanfare going on at the hotel all around him, it reflects his state of mind and it's achieved with such precision to detail... and again here I'm going to compare to Kubrick, like Jack in the Shining - that kind of psychological breakdown. But The Shining has been appreciated by the mainstream too, while Death in Venice is largely unwatchable for the mainstream. This is higher art. The scenes where he comes close to the boy, and the finale is just so perfectly executed, that every filmmaker should watch Death in Venice as a lesson.",Death in Venice

Visconti revels in the portrayal of beauty, it's passing, and the whiff of decay beneath.Trained as an opera director, Visconti blends Mahler's music and imagery seamlessly in his finest film since ""The Leopard"" (another stunning film, which greatly influenced Coppola's Sicily in the ""Godfather"").",Death in Venice

82,Chalker1123,A Study in Beauty and Decay,7,12 February 2006,"In Luchino Visconti's film Death in Venice, it is not only the beauty in the surrounding world that decays, but in the pursuit of beauty itself Gustav von Aschenbach decays into a mere shell of a man. To understand the decay, we must acknowledge the beauty which enchants us, it is best described, and explained in a quote from Socrates found in Thomas Mann's version of Death in Venice, ""beauty alone, is lovely and visible at once it is the sole aspect of the spiritual which we can perceive through our senses Else whatif the divine, if reason and virtue and truth were to speak to us through the senses? Should we not perish and become consumed by love?"" We see in the film this very thing happen, the man becomes enveloped by a longing for beauty, which turns into a longing for the boy, Tadzio. Even though the levelheaded part of his mind tells him that adoration of beauty can lead to sensuousness and abandon, he cannot contain himself. It would be easy to describe this as a beautiful film; early on we see the extravagance of the parlor, and we are treated to a perfect summarization of turn-of-the century upper class life, all captured on film perfectly by cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis. But Visconti does not indulge in the picturesque aspects of Venice. Instead, the glorious and sensuous artistic achievements of the past are based on materialism and sensuous beauty, and these things are relegated to the past. The city we know to be of incomparable beauty and uniqueness is nothing more than a leisure resort with a nosy hotel staff. The streets become exhausting labyrinths filled with disgusting filth and rot, the city decays in step with the protagonist. Only through the flashbacks are we allowed a glimpse of why this famous composer is a frail and innocuous man. The death of his daughter, and presumably his wife, along with the failure of his music allow us to understand why he is destroying himself. Alfred, with whom Aschenbach has in depth conversations on the meaning of beauty and who can create it; but Alfred is more than a friend, he is Aschenbach's alter-ego, and what Alfred says articulates the composer's own doubts and fears. The scene in which Aschenbach decides to leave Venice is immediately followed by a clip of Alfred telling him that he is weak, alienated and lacks feelings. In the end we might be able to conclude that these flashbacks are not reality at all. It is a decay of memory, rather than objective renderings of the past, these flashbacks become distorted memories. We can say that these are decayed memories because even Aschenbach alludes to it, he declares, ""reality distracts and degrades us;"" and, following the scene in the travel agent's office we see Aschenbach confront Tadzio and his family and warn them - leave Venice, but directly after the encounter we see him sitting with the clerk again and realize it was all in his imagination, he employs long scenes without dialogue that are framed by the poignant music of Gustav Mahler. He allows the viewer's mind to wander as we watch Aschenbach's life and respectability decay with the beauty around him. Slowly the viewer realizes that our hero is overwhelmed by exhaustion that is mixed with a growing awareness that the town is suffocating in filth. The crumbling city sets the stage for the middle aged man's attraction to Tadzio, it is romantic longing for something so idealized and ambiguous that it can never be consumed, even in fantasy. The beauty of this Polish boy kindles a fire in him that, at first, makes him glow, then consumes him. The film concludes with von Aschenbach sitting feebly in a beach chair watching Tadzio fight with his friend, we see the black dye from his hair running down on his cheek and it looks like rotten blood, it is a vision of his life's expiring moments, though before his last breath. The final decay has happened, all around him the city is soiled, and with it he has become what he detests. As Aschenbach dies he has the same painted face as the old man on the ferry at the beginning of the film, a man that had disturbed him. It was the pursuit of beauty that initiated his decay, in the pursuit of artistic beauty he could not sense his own demise, and that of the city around him; his sensuality is indulged in, while constantly kept in check by the presence of death and decay. It is these three themes that tie The Damned and Death in Venice together, beauty, death, and decay, these themes are Visconti's art, the beauty of his work is in the decay of beauty itself. In this film we are treated to the deliquescence of one great man. We see the honored composer Gustav von Aschenbach in the pursuit of true and pure beauty, and it is in the pursuit of this trait that it decays all around him and leads him to a miserable, lonely death watching the target of his affection. I believe that through these movies Visconti is trying to tell us that what is beautiful cannot last. Decay is intrinsic in the world around us, and when we become distracted, it can destroy the splendor. In Death in Venice, it is because of culture and through the pursuit of beauty that all is deleted. Beauty and deliquescence are woven together like thorns in Visconti's works, at once beautiful and destructive, it is these themes that define his art.",Death in Venice

I'm not even going to attempt to explain why a man once married is supposedly breath-takingly captivated by a young boy. Weird things happen in life without explanation. But I didn't feel it or understand it. Bjorn Andressen is like the chunk of ice in a great sip of bourbon. Just diluting the whole strength of something that should have some bite to it. Having the boy turn around and just stare at the older man (Dirk Bogarde) every few minutes became annoying and...I hate to say it.. unbelievable.. unless he just flat out thought the guy was creepy enough to pause every step of the way and look back at. Okay... the Mahler score is periodic and understandable.. but the swelling violins every few minutes that had no bearing on the scene.. was just downright idiotic to me.

87,rlac66,A beautiful and complex film,8,21 February 2003,"CAUTION: SPOILERSAlthough this film moved a bit slow at times, the brilliant scenery, richness of the characters and powerful themes make `Morte a Venezia' a rewarding experience. I have not read Thomas Mann's book, but I am certain that Visconti's visual splendour, musical score, and powerful evocation of conflict and desire must do it justice. The study of Gustav von Aschenbach alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions, behaviour and passion.  This tendency is demonstrated in the scene in Germany between Alfred and Gustav when Alfred describes Music as being both mathematical--i.e. quantifiable--and emotional. This conflict arises again in the scene where young Tadzio is alone playing `Fuer Elise' in lobby of the Hotel and Gustav recalls his visit to a bordello where he is drawn to a prostitute who plays the same song. In his flashback, after paying the prostitute, Gustav is clearly physically seized by the consequences of his actions. This reaction acts as a reminder of the moral reaction to the temptations that Tadzio represents.
Ultimately, Gustav is forced to make his biggest decision: stay in Venice and resign himself to his lust and temptations? Or flee Venice to save his own life? His early attempt to flee Venice at the train station resulted in a futility and foreshadows the outcome of prolonging his stay.Complimenting the captivating character interaction, Visconti's powerful scenery (especially of Venice at Dawn and the final scene of Tadzio walking into the water and pointing to the horizon) renders this film a true masterpiece.",Death in Venice

I reconstruct the dialog from (faded) memory thus: ""Au contraire"", he replies, ""I love them. I have seen 'Morte a Venezia' several times"". ""This horrible movie, where this old man dies before he has attained love?"" ""Oui madame. True love is unattainable"". This is indeed the massage conveyed by Luchino Visconti's masterpiece, but many would disagree about it being the core message. Thomas Mann's core masseage in 'Tod in Venedig', of which the film is an adapration, is decay. This message - decay, the power of it, its morbid seduction -is indeed conveyed by the film, on an elegiac - even epic - scale.The scenery is breathtaking: Venice, a museum masquerading as city, going under. Stark images of opulence contrast with those of people dying of cholera. So does contrast the image of Gustav von Aschenbach, who has lost his yoth long and recently also his artistic inspiration, thus could be said to be, as far as an artist, already dead, with the image of young Tadeusz, whose beauty penetrates every scene where he is present. As to the soundtrack, the film would have been a masterpiece even if it had none. But it is dressed in the melancholic sound of Gustav Mahler's sinfonies, and it is worth watching even for those who feel nothing for anything but love Mahler.And then, Dirk Bogarde: he would have been remembered today even if this acting were the only thing he did in his entire life. You cannot call yourself cultured and not have seen 'Morte a Venezia'.A sociological note. When I was seeing this film in Germany back in the 80s/90s, the theater was always packed, which is kind of natural. What was unnatural was the composition of the audience. You had public prosecutors, criminal attorneys, corporate lawyers, bankers, all with their spouses dressed up as if they were going to the opera. You had artists, dressed as artists use to dress. You had intellectuals. You had an inordinate amount of homosexuals, who were visible, even though back then they did not try to be visible. You had BDSM freaks, culture freaks, and real freaks, all distinguishable by their respective dress codes. You had the Hell's Angels types with their body-pierced girlfriends. And you had the militant subculture, down to the anarchists of that day: supporters of domestic terrorists. They were not seated in separate blocks; you had Hell's Angel sitting next to His Excellency's wife, and His Excellency sitting next to a freak. They entered the theater speaking in soft voices. During the film, they held the breath. Afterwards, they could not utter a single word, and left in silence. It was like a church service.",Death in Venice

93,colorado-32493,excellent infatuation 'degradation' and death...film is a jewel,10,21 June 2017,So many good reviews. The film is excellent the book also. It is mostly a tragic gay love infatuation story. The people who go into beauty--ascetics--death perfection of art on and on (and the movie does present the story this way) are missing the real story.The real story comes out better in the book = a late middle aged man (Dirk Bogarde is too young and handsome for the role) becomes infatuated with a 15 year old boy. Possibly the first such awakening of his homosexual id--in 1913 it was still punishable with prison.In Mann's book Aschenbach was an author (it is widely believed Mann had Gustav Mahler in mind). In any case Aschenbach has had lots of losses in life and recent failures in his career and is suffering from a near mental breakdown. Now comes the ultimate degradation of his persona as he becomes infatuated with Tadzio. Mann was no stranger to psychoanalysis so there was clearly a carnal interest as well.The movie miscasts Tadzio--Bjorn Andreson is too lithesome and feminine and frankly not sexy enough for the role. A dramatically better movie would have cast him better--everything would be much more understandable then. Most of all he needed to be much more masculine.So....Aschenbach sinks lower and lower--dyeing his hair and using make up to attract the boy. The movie is pretty clear about the sexual nature of all this--but has lots of flash backs feeding this cover up that it was all about art and ascetics beauty death blah blah blah. While it was mostly hormones.The costumes are wonderful...everything really well done...I could spend hours talking about symbolism e.g. Esmeralda the boat to Venice also the name of Aschenbach's first prostitute (sexual adventure)... That would be an effort and bore everybody. These things you appreciate as the movie unfolds and add depth and intelligence to the film no need to enumerate them (plus there are too many to count). The film is a jewel that way.Read the novella and buy Mahler's 5th. But you know the film is uniquely good as well. This is rare (a movie as good or better than the book).RECOMMEND HIGHLY,Death in Venice
94,wolfie-52307,All 17 year old philistines please avoid this film,10,20 August 2018,"This film is an excellent (though necessarily slightly different) version of Thomas Mann's novella of the same name. Its effect was so powerful that it drew me to the Venice Lido to stay at the Hotel des Bains, where both film and book are set, and even since that hotel closed, I go back regularly. To me it's about the impossibility of obtaining one's heart's desire, and to read ignorant reviews from 17 year olds makes me cringe To them I say"" No, it isn't a film version of a video game..what made you think it would be?""

95,alhiyah,THE BEST VISCONTI,10,31 August 2001,"This film is a summary of Visconti's obssessions: the decadence of nobility, death, aesthetic search, homosexuality...All mingled with melancholic mastery. Slow-paced just to make you abler to contemplate all its beauty (which is in the music and the images as well as in the story)this is the type of film we are not allowed to enjoy anymore, brave, deeply personal and intelligent. The genuine fruit of a genius like Visconti.",Death in Venice

Can a camera be the eye of a person with direct connection to your heart? This is it. The most beautiful music, the most beautiful movie I have ever seen.",Death in Venice
97,jbondono,"Very slow, repetative and boring",3,1 December 2002,"I'm a fan of Mahler's music and expected to enjoy this movie for that fact alone, even if the plot was not to my liking or the music was poorly played. Wow was I ever in for a surprise!  The plot was nearly non-existant and its barely-there-story was told so extremely slowly that the movie bored me to death.  And the music was simply the Adagietto movement from Mahler's fifth symphony played over and over and over and over and over and over....Make sure to set your sleep timer on this one or your TV might be eating electrcity all night long while you snore away.",Death in Venice
98,Tardis101,I can't believe the positive reviews,2,6 June 2018,"This film is terrible, it completely misses the point of the book, and destroys any of the philosophical discussion the book created. It's honestly just some not very well done scenes of a guy following a child around Venice. Unlike in the book there is no internal monologue describing why this man feels this way or why he is doing this. The few flashback scenes were pointless and the philosophy discussed in them isn't anything intellectual. A huge disservice to the beauty and tragedy of the novel. I can't believe the number of people raving over this film. It turns a book about beauty, idolization, decay, obsession, and aestheticism into a pretentious 2 hours of a creepy guy following s boy around.",Death in Venice
99,tim-john-mead,Pretense on top of pretending,1,27 September 2014,"In DIV, Visconti overstates the Mahlerishness of Aschenbach to the point of confusion, and worse, does the same to the 'boy-ogler' interpretation of Aschenbach to the point of insult. The result ends up feeling like an horrific parody - or even fictional bio - of the great composer / conductor.Mann, upon whose work the film is apparently based, much admired Mahler, and, learning of his death, gave Aschenbach Mahler's first name and (apparently), his appearance - but unlike Visconti, Mann cast him as a writer, not a composer. Mann's written work was already mostly finalised when these 'honours' were bestowed at any rate. But more importantly, Mann is widely thought to have drawn from a number of different sources for his main character; different traits from different people, and to specific ends. In short, the clumsiness of the film's choice of visuals, seems to lecherise Mahler himself through a 'little boy obsessed' Aschenbach, and insinuate something of Mahler himself which has no real basis. The overplayed likeness left the feeling that what was going on was really nothing to do with the novella, but instead a 'secret revealed' about Mahler. And so the story lost all philosophical meaning immediately, and became something more like slander or gossip, leaving the perhaps less studied Mahler-appreciating audience to be misled into supposing all sorts of things - even trying to extrapolate something of the historical relationship between Mahler and Schonberg (as if Mahler's helping of Schonberg required any more motivation than memories of his aspiring composer / musician younger brother, Otto!)But aside from this terrific complaint which I might at least be able to (unreasonably!) write off to misinterpretation, the film's slow broody stillness - and labored sincerity - cannot reach a shadow of the way to the effortlessly profound music which it misappropriated. Way back in the day (July 19, 1971), Alan Rich did a great review of this movie in the New York Magazine. ""...the insult to Mahler doesn't like in any imputation about homosexuality, not even in the way this element is luridly underlined in the movie. It lies, rather, in the cheap, uncomprehending niggle-naggle about the arts that Visconti puts into the mouths of Aschenbach-Mahler and Alfred [-Schonberg]...""It's easy enough to find on googlebooks. That review pretty much says it all - other than one more comment which desperately need to be made, and that being, that the film's lack of subtlety pushed it Aschenbach firmly into 'little boy ogler' territory, which was simply creepy, but which also obliterated much of the intelligent introspection and 'longing for the lost days of youth' that the film might have otherwise evoked. Someone likes it I guess. Not me. Tacky. Slow. Self-serious. Overblown. Self-important. Failed art- house bordering on mockumentry bordering on defamation.",Death in Venice
100,hvidberg,"Aschenbach, please don't die, keep on suffering",10,14 December 1998,"A comment to Grand Panjandrum's comment: In my opinion Visconti has a lot more to show us than just Aschenbach (Mahlers) problems with combining his spiritual ideals with homosexual lust. It is a story of weltschmertzzzz, of dreariness of the world, and the length and lack of tempo of the film is in itself a point: it is suffering and agony of death put on celluloid, like the slow running out of the sand clock. It can't be done anymore pathethic and 'artsy fartsy', but that's the pleasure of the whole film, pleasurable suffering, beautiful longing (and so on and so on). My point: If the film wasn't that long and boring it would be pointless.",Death in Venice

Laden with superficial and pseudo-intellectual flashbacks, in which the performances are even worse that in the rest of the movie, surely due to the torture of having to recite whole paragraphs of cheap Philosophy guides that not even the director understood. Add to that the constant and irritating use of unnecessary, clumsily done zooms, and you have an almost unbearable film experience that not even all the Mahlers in the world could save.",Death in Venice
102,meccorbin,A Cinematic Masterpiece,8,12 December 2002,"Contains SpoilersLuchino Visconti's film adaptation of Thomas Mann's novella is visually, if not philosophically, faithful to its source (Britten's opera offers a more faithful reading of the Apollonian/Dionysian struggles which consume the aging writer). It is certainly one of the most gorgeous films ever made. In the Visconti version, the emphasis is more on the physical aspects of the story. Never has Venice looked more beautiful and alluring, more decadent and effete. If you've read the novella, it's like having the descriptions on its pages come to life. Dirk Bogarde gives an outstanding performance as Gustav von Aschenbach. Although he has very little dialogue, he conveys the bitterness, aroused passion and finally, pitiful yearning of Aschenbach through facial expressions alone. Bjorn Andresen, the young actor who plays Tadzio, the beautiful object of Aschenbach's desire, was perfectly cast. He too plays the part with facial expressions and gestures. The Tadzio character is pivotal to the story, so any actor in this role must be worthy of inspiring passion and desire. Visconti, with his incredible eye for beauty, knew exactly what he was doing. And changing Ashenbach from a writer to a composer based on Gustav Mahler, and then using Mahler's music, especially the Adagietto from the 5th Symphony, was another brilliant stroke. Although I'd read the Mann story before the film, Mahler's music and Death in Venice will always be inextricably linked in my mind. As will the haunting images which appear throughout the film, especially that last one of Ashenbach dying on the beach as Tadzio walks slowly into the sea. One day this film will be released in DVD widescreen format and its visual splendors completely restored to us.",Death in Venice
103,mendo-18530,A masterpiece by Grandmaster Luchino Visconti,10,17 June 2021,"I have watched Visconti's film Death in Venice three or four times in these last fifty years. When I was young, this movie was incomprehensible and boring to me. Today, this film is understandable to me, but still boring.Death in Venice is not a film for everyone and most of today's audience will not accept it. This film can only be accepted by serious film art lovers and film professionals. In addition, at all film academies and schools, Death in Venice should be mandatory in teaching students how to direct a perfect film.I can't understand why Luchino Visconti decided to make a film just about that Thomas Mann story, but what he did is a great film work. This film is perfect in every bit of it, from the first to the last second. Simply, cinematic perfection.And finally, Luchino Visconti is not guilty because Thomas Mann was a boring writer. :)",Death in Venice
104,da_san11,Sublime,10,1 April 2002,"Morte a Venezia is one of my favorite movies. More than beautiful, it's really sublime. It gives you important aesthetic experiences, it's a masterpiece. I also recommend the novel. Luchino Visconti is a genius.",Death in Venice
105,mintball1,The most beautiful film ever?,10,9 May 2005,"It doesn't (and probably can't) capture the philosophical complexity of Thomas Mann's novella, but Luchino Visconti's film does create a sense of sensual decay and presses home the idea of the importance of grasping hold of the opportunities that life offers.But it goes beyond that. It is a beautiful film to look at  almost creating Impressionist canvases on occasion  and, by changing Aschenbach from Mann's novelist to a Mahler-esquire composer, and using Mahler's third and fifth symphonies (the Allegretto from the latter is a major theme), Visconti finds an apt substitute for the original.Indeed, perhaps it's no coincidence that Visconti uses very, very little dialogue. This could almost be a silent movie.Dirk Bogarde is fantastic. Given the restrictions (but arguably the freedom) of so few words, he conveys depths of emotion as few screen actors have done.Sumptuous; beautiful; sensual: this really is an extraordinary piece of film-making.",Death in Venice
106,neilshuffle,Truly sense of cinema,8,13 February 2015,"Death in Venice comes from an obsession for a perfect beauty ending up in what we can understand as Wagner's conception of liebestod ( erotic (death). The Luchino Visconti version of Thomas Mann's novel is based on an uninspired composer Gustav Von Asenbach. However in the book he is a novelist who is old and resentful, his disposition takes him on a journey through the magnificent historic city of Venice. During his time there he becomes enchanted by Tadzio, a polish boy whom he perceives as the ideal conception of beautifulness. The back drop is of a city that's declining in an atmosphere of uncertainty as a mysterious plague (cholera) carries death to its inhabitants. This bizarre transformation of Venice is contrasted by the beauty of Tadzio.The movie is quite slow, but it appeals for its details that enhance and reward the attention paid to them. Such as the paused attitude of Achenbach interpreted by Dirk Bogarde, who is unobtrusive and formal in his behaviour. An undercurrent of emotions invade him in the presence of Tadzio. Aschenbach is a man of good manners and harsh convictions, but Tadzio makes him question his firmly held principals. Tormented by feelings he needs the attention of the boy, and considers doing something which is for him outrageous. An old man groomed to look younger disgusts him, Tadzio has become Gustavs obsessive desire and he concedes. The movies dialog is constrained but beyond this, emotion is added by what is not said but what is obvious, here it applies greater depth. These contrasts focus on the central point of this work of motion art. The essentials revolve around conflicts in the mind of Von Aschenbach as he perceives perfect beauty in a young man.Having read the book I can say that the director Luchino Visconti, shifts a few things from the context of the novel to a visual adaptation that works in general as the changes are convincing. Therefore we can understand the film in a form creating a perspective of the struggle Von Aschenbach has searching for reasons to liberate his conscience. In the movie he says that beauty comes and is created in the spirit, not from the senses but when he sees Tadzio for the first time a fleeting unelaborated sense is filling him for a finale of sexual passion, his resistive sense of morality is released to the winds.",Death in Venice
107,podiumman,An excellent art Film!!!,10,17 May 2004,"I saw this many years ago when I was in High School. I can't wait to get on DVD and share with my wife now.One thing I want to comment on (and I don't think I am giving anything away here really) is that the relationship between Gustav A. (Gustav Mahler?) was not one of latent homosexuality, IMHO (not that there's anything wrong with that), but is rather a yearning on the behalf of the ill Gustav A. for a lost youth he will never recover.Regarding the person who said he ""guessed he was just low-brow."" Fine, be low-brow, but why do you then rent or buy art flicks? This would be like a ""high-brow"" viewing a Rambo film and then grousing about it.",Death in Venice

109,glenn_au-252-907810,"Nice lighting, music and quiet story arc. Imbecilic direction.",4,1 March 2015,"An otherwise great cinema experience is severely hampered by imbecilic direction by Visconti. Not one scene can pass without a zoom-in. There is no reason, no allusion to a greater context or subtext. This is not a facet of everyday vision. People don't race up to other people to hold an observation or a conversation, then race back to their marks again. We do not yet possess telescopic zoom for our eyes. Outside of a sniper's technical demonstration guide the zoom has little place in ornate Venice. When the zoom isn't abruptly jolting your immersion away from lavish sets and beautiful music there contends a creaky slow wobbly pan and camera trundle, reminding you of an arthritic geriatric attempting to move a hundred ton piece of equipment. At one point in the motel the camera was steady - a minor miracle, no idiotic zoom yet - only to attempt a pan right ... It went left accidentally towards a wall then corrected immediately to follow the actor. It is misery.

110,estrovam,great!,10,16 July 2005,"This is a beautiful movie about art, love and death. Visconti investigates the nature of artistic inspiration and the creator's mind. Moreover, is one of the best films about love I have ever seen. Love is a mystery,love is madness, love is unpredictable, love is innocent, love is happiness and love is death. A famous composer Gustav von Aschenbach comes to Venice - to fall in love with a handsome Polish adolescent and to die. Aschenbach's obsession with a boy is accompanied by powerful Gustav Maler's music. The final scene of Aschenbach's dying on the beach is the most impressive episode of the film and, to my mind, one of the deepest and unforgettable scenes in world cinema.",Death in Venice

Based on Thomas Mann's Original Book, Beauty, art and decadence coexist in a film that will lead you, once you watch carefully, to some of the most important subjective and aesthetical questions ever made in the XX century. The sexual issues in art and life, the quest for the artist's real identity and poetry as a seductive path to the abyss are some of the topics suggested in the somehow ""strange"" plot of the movie, hidden in it's slow, deep, reflexive and delicate ambient. The hard road to man's sexual and artistic self-knowledge, and the contradictions implied by both.A movie that does complete justice to the book, exploring different aspects that enrich the whole idea and reflection portrayed in the original text.",Death in Venice

The movie is a Mahler's music told the other way, by other means, the music he has created from his very own spirit, so is it a story about Gustav Mahler too? Yes definitely it is.",Death in Venice
113,Ygorbc,What is beauty anyways?,8,14 June 2020,"I had the craziest interpretation, hear me out: Tadzio is some sort of evil presence, an manifestation of Lucifer, beauty at its purest form.
When Gustav first arrives in Venice, he quickly becomes obsessed with the young boy. He's everything he was looking for and needed. Why? Well, shortly before his arrival, Gustav was very sick due to his last presentation and a doctor recommended a rest, away from it all.
When we see flashbacks of him and Alfred, the latter reminds him of how he will always be judged and condemmed because he won't be able to make music in a perfect way due to his old age. Gustav also talks a lot about art and beauty, it must be beautiful and not ambiguous.
Everything then leads to Tadzio, he is a pure form of beauty, he is young and Gustav sees in him something worth protecting and having, he's obsessed.
So what makes me think Tadzio is evil?
Well, you can see that the character exhales power, everyone loves him, everyone wants to control him, but he can't be tamned. The governess trys it, his mom tries it, the boy at the beach trys it, but they still do it all for him and give in to his power, especially Gustav who at firsts notices that being close to him will be his ruin, but after seeing the man dying in the station he realizes that it's what he need, being close to Tadzio is something worth dying for, and the boy knows it, you can see it when he stares at Aschenbach, trying to atract and get him close, because he finds it satisfying to play with.
When Gustav finally dies due to the epidemic (or because his heart couldn't resist such proximity to something perfect?), Tadzio finally gives him a sign other than just stares meaning that his work is done, and Gustav, nothing in the way he expected, reached perfection",Death in Venice
