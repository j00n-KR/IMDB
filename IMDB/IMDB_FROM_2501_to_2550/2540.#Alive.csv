0,Leofwine_draca,The director's hard work pays off,7,9 September 2020,"#ALIVE is a South Korean film with a very simplistic and familiar presence - a young man hides out in his apartment during a zombie apocalypse - that some have linked to the French indie THE NIGHT EATS THE WORLD. But then it is a very generic kind of premise that I had the idea of writing myself a decade or so ago. In any case, films like this live or die depending on the execution, and the good news is that #ALIVE is a winner thanks to plenty of hard work on the part of the director, who wrings maximum suspense, humour and action from that premise. It's fast-paced and engaging, saddled with an annoying but realistic lead who grows on you as the story progresses, and a great female supporting character. The zombies are the scary ones you'll remember from TRAIN TO BUSAN and KINGDOM, making this all the more gripping.",#Alive
1,kosmasp,#Alone,8,29 September 2020,"When it comes down to it, in the end we are alone, even while Alive (which is the actual english title of the movie). Even if there are others around you (zombies or otherwise), you can only count on yourself. Well unless ... although can you even trust yourself? And maybe you can trust others? Maybe not though ... this movie is more on the tension side than on the action side of it.You will still see blood and violence, just don't expect this to be something it isn't. Having said that, this may very well be an accurate version of what would happen in a very densely populated area ... and how some people would react to it. Not just our main character. If that sounds good to you, give it a shot (no pun intended, especially because there aren't that many weapons to begin with) ...",#Alive
2,Sleepin_Dragon,#Imaginative.,7,11 September 2020,"I rather enjoyed #Alive, it didn't feel like the average zombie movie. There seemed to be some parallels between the imagined threat here, and the very real threat, Coronavirus. There's a great scene where our man looks outside fearfully, and then looks at his food rations, something many people have done in 2020.It's very nicely acted, nicely shot, it feels very fresh and current. The moments of horror were very nicely done, and never became too silly. Some nice twists, it's never predictable.It has a real sense of doom, and terror about it, the way things gradually collapse, that said the action begins quickly, they don't hang around.It's good, 7/10.",#Alive
3,classicsoncall,"""Oh, I see you're still alive. Nice to meet you.""",6,21 February 2021,"This movie and it's virtual American twin ""Alone"" were released only about five weeks apart, and if you see either one, you've seen them both. Only this one is in Korean with Korean actors, and I guess, Korean zombies. Reviewers on the ""Alone"" board pretty much concede that this one is the better of the two in terms of zombie spectacle and I'd have to agree with that. The zombies in this film are more crazed and bounce around like the marbles in a pin-ball machine. The neighbor who made his way into Oh Joon-woo's (Yoo Ah-In) apartment at the beginning of the story was absolutely outstanding when he began his turn after being infected. I'm surprised he didn't dislocate body parts with all those herky-jerky movements; heck, maybe he did, who would know? On the plus side for ""Alone"" was that they had Donald Sutherland in the cast as an elderly apartment dweller trying to fend for his infected wife. If you don't follow Korean cinema, you wouldn't know any of the players here, much less Sutherland's counterpart. Each film is currently playing on Netflix so you can watch both and make your own comparisons, but I think you'll find like I did, that you don't really have to.",#Alive
4,paul_haakonsen,"Not your average, generic zombie movie...",6,27 August 2020,"Oddly enough I hadn't even heard about ""#Alive"" before getting the opportunity to sit down and watch it. And even more surprising is that I am a huge fan of zombie movies, so the fact that ""Alive"" had eluded me was odd.Nevertheless, this being the year that the highly anticipated ""Peninsula"" - the sequel to ""Train to Busan"" - also coming out, it was a little bit strange to find another zombie movie from the South Korean cinema. Not that I mind that, no, no, no. Not at all. In fact ""#Alive"" (aka ""#Saraitda"") actually turned out to be more enjoyable and entertaining than ""Peninsula"" was. Yeah, I know, right...Anyway, I will say that ""#Alive"" is not your average run-of-the-mill zombie movie. And I love the way that the movie starts out and just throws the audience right into the action. That was just glorious. I liked that so much, because the zombie action is what is enjoyable, not the things leading up to it.The acting in ""#Alive"" was good, and the lead actor and actress managed to carry the movie quite well, especially since there were hardly any other performers in the movie with dialogue.The zombie make-up and effects were good, and taking into consideration that this was in the beginning of an outbreak, you shouldn't expect to see fully decomposed shambling corpses. Normally I am not overly keen on running and agile zombies, but I will say that it actually worked out well enough in ""#Alive"", for some reason.If you enjoy zombie movies, then you definitely should take the time to sit down and watch the 2020 movie ""#Alive"" from writer and director Il Cho, because it does bring new contents to the zombie genre.I am rating ""#Alive"" a six out of ten star. Quite worth the time, money and effort, and a well-worthy addition to the zombie genre. So it seems that 2020 did end up with a proper zombie movie after all.",#Alive
5,BandSAboutMovies,I liked it!,6,5 October 2020,"Based on the script for Alone by Matt Naylor, who co-adapted his script with Cho and will see his version of the film release later this month, this movie finds a live streamer named Oh Joon-woo facing the kind of battles that he'd only had online as zombies take over most of South Korea.After learning that his family has been killed, the loneliness and pointlessness of life alone gets to him and he attempts to kill himself. He's once stayed inside, away from the rest of humanity and now, he may very well be the last person left alive.That's when a laser pointer flashes and he realizes that there's somebody else left. Kim Yoo-bin has used traps and an axe to stay alive, using her wits when all Oh Joon-woo has done is hide.If you've read Max Brooks' World War Z, the story ""Kondo Tatsumi,"" about a Japanese gamer in a similar situation, may strike you as being very much like this story.The end of the film really recalled Shaun of the Dead, which is not a bad thing. In a world where every zombie story has seemingly been told, this tale of a young man staying locked within his apartment - afraid to come outside as a plague ravages everyone else - is alarmingly all too real.",#Alive
6,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Decent enough if highly flawed genre effort,8,15 September 2020,"In the middle of the city, a man witnesses a zombie pandemic carrying on in the streets around him and barricades himself in his apartment to get away from the ravenous beings, but the more he stays isolated by himself the more he feels the need to survive the zombie pandemic.For the most part, this was a rather enjoyable and entertaining effort. Among the more enjoyable aspects of this one is the immediacy of the film to drop us into the zombie apocalypse. The pre-credits sequence showing how he gets isolated with the TV news reports and live-action scenes showing the creatures overrunning the area grabbing and biting everyone they come across gets us into the film exceptionally quickly. That the ferocity and intensity of their actions are given rather early on makes for a much more thrilling and intimidating threat through these impressive sequences is fun with the way it sets the film going. Moreover, this early build-up causes the film plenty to like when it comes to the attempts at out-maneuvering the creatures later on. With either the shots of survivors getting overwhelmed as he can't help them in time or the various encounters that emerge later on when both he and the neighbor across the street are forced to deal with the creatures trying to get into their apartments, the second half here picks up on the action nicely which sets up the fantastic finale. Featuring their escape into the complex and dash to get away before the final series of battles to get out of the apartment. Combined with the stellar zombie make-up and effects, these are the film's positives. This one does have some flaws with it. One of the biggest issues is the fact that so much of the film seems to consist of useless padding to beef up a running time that still goes on way too long. The idea of what he does by himself while he's alone isn't that interesting, from struggling to get a signal for his devices, record videos for an internet channel that doesn't exist anymore or acting as an excitable idiot around the girl which don't bring anything new or interesting to these type of scenes. These are commonly utilized in these kinds of films, building up plenty of cliches and suspected moments that highlight how utterly stupid the character is. The other flaw to be had here is the film's highly problematic final half which is quite chaotic and meandering. There's little need to introduce yet a third survivor into the mix simply to pull out a series of random twists with the character to then to just dismiss it all with a resolution that alerts the creatures to them and making their escape all the more difficult because it has to keep up the inclusion of this completely doesn't need to be there and could've been taken out completely to shave off time and the typically overdone and useless Korean melodrama. These are what hold this one back somewhat.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Violence.",#Alive
7,phd_travel,Exciting survival zombie action,8,23 August 2020,Park Shin Hye and Yoo Ah In Look alike so there's chemistry. The story is entertaining. Liked the survival elements. The way they communicated and got food is quite fun. The zombie chase up the apartment buildings is exciting. The length is relatively shorter than some other action movies so it doesn't drag.Worth a watch.,#Alive
8,deloudelouvain,Another good Korean zombie movie.,8,6 November 2020,"In this genre, the zombie genre that is, Alive (or Saraitda) deserves a good score on here. I wouldn't pay too much attention to the negative reviews if you like well made zombie flicks. Neither would I pay too much attention to the reviews stating it's a remake of a French movie as it doesn't matter. What matters is that it is entertaining and that you enjoy it. I thought the make-up artists did a very good job with their scary looking zombies. Other reviewers state that Train To Busan (or Busanhaeng from 2016) was better but here again it doesn't matter to compare it. It's a different story, even though it's also a zombie movie. To be honest I liked both of them equally. In Alive you basically only have two characters to follow but both did a great job playing their character. Ah-In Yoo and Shin-Hye Park were very convincing in their roles and that's a bonus as with Asian movies it's not always the case. Korean movies are by far the best from what comes from that part of the world. Koreans know how to make quality movies, rarely the typical overacting like in other Asian countries. So in short, if you're a fan of Korean movies and have a weak spot for the zombie genre then I would give Alive a shot, you won't be disappointed.",#Alive
9,siderite,A zombie film about two youngsters trapped in their apartment flats. Nothing new and quite boring.,5,16 September 2020,"The entire film I was expecting a twist. It couldn't be just about what I was seeing. I mean, South Korean, right? They are expert zombie film makers. And yet at the very end nothing happened other than the expected. The only thing that raised an eyebrow is how deadly were the zombies in the very beginning and how poorly they were doing their chomping job at the end. The least they could do is make the difference between a contagion (which is what they were selling it at) and a zombie (which was what the infected actually were). They didn't even do that.Bottom line: boring and uninspiring.",#Alive
10,Pjtaylor-96-138044,#notsponsored,6,23 September 2020,"For the most part, '#Alive (2020)' is a fairly standard zombie movie. One of its more unique aspects is the fact that it mostly takes place inside a single apartment, seeing our protagonist struggle with low-supplies whilst in terrified isolation. In some ways, the picture is almost an allegory for the 'worst case scenario' that many envision when they think of COVID-19, an anxiety that was especially prevalent prior to any proper governmental guidelines (which is around the time the film must've gone into production). This subtext isn't exactly overt, though; the affair can be enjoyed as a straight genre piece. The experience feels more 'street level' than a lot of similar fare and, aside from one or two strained plot-points, it plays out in a relatively 'realistic' sort of way. It has a handful of exciting and suspenseful sequences, but it isn't exactly scary (to the point that scares don't even seem to have been all that important to the filmmakers) and it has a couple of problems with tone. It's also somewhat dull at times. However, most sagging sections are rather quickly interrupted with something more interesting. Ultimately, it's diverting enough to be worth a watch if you're a fan of its genre. 6/10",#Alive
11,ThomasDrufke,A Different Type of Zombie Flick,8,13 January 2021,"An under the radar Netflix film that covers a zombie apocalypse in a much less invasive and overwhelming way, simply focusing on 2 people living across the street in downtown Seoul during a zombie invasion. It's beatifully calm and romantic at times, while also containing legitimate tension and terror at times as well. Alive is utterly fantastic.8.5/10",#Alive
12,Cineanalyst,#IdentityRouting,5,15 September 2020,"""Alive,"" or ""#Alive,"" seems an apt zombie flick to view during the widespread quarantine of a real-world pandemic, as the survivors of the movie's outbreak of the undead lock themselves in their apartments. It's about time in another way, too, as I've never understood why in most such movies the living try to run away from fast zombies and hide from slow ones--seems backwards to me. So, kudos to ""Alive"" merely for the hiding, for the most part, from the speedy ghouls. It also allows for an unusual examination of survivalist tactics: more watching TV for news and rationing food than aiming for the head. The application of gamer skills is more iffy. Moreover, the reports on TV largely treat the outbreak as a viral epidemic. Other zombie flicks have done this, as well, though. What really stands out in this one begins in the title with the hashtag; this is a picture thoroughly wired to the age of social media, mobile phones and the internet.Ostensibly, the tacky message at the end glorifies this media, but I'd argue the scenario overall rests on an unsettling depiction of technology--to the point that the zombies are a metaphor for lives lived online. The moral depicts the military, as an extension of government, saving people by tracking them through social media. It's eerily similar to what the zombies do throughout the picture in stealing people's identities. In fact, they don't see or smell you; it's only when you make a sound that they come after you. Largely, this is through technology. Note that although the water supply is cut off, electricity somehow remains, and TV is only lost when the hero finds an unusual way to cut the cord, so to speak. In the plot, the outbreak begins when our gamer protagonist is online with his friends. Later, he sends messages to his online followers. The attention of the undead is also gained by his attempts to connect with others--whether by drones, leaning over edges with his phone attached to a selfie stick, or, by more old-fashioned methods, radio, non-electrical wire and simply yelling out to the world.The narrative goes out of its way, too, in pointing out that the characters are separated within apartments despite their urban proximity. Cannibalism, like social media and the government tracking you through it, brings these people together. I'm not going to bother wondering whether any of that is a good message, but the dichotomies are interesting: close together yet separated, hiding but calling for help, attention feared and desired, connected and disconnected. Oh, the zombie action is OK, too, if nothing especially innovative and even if the puppy-love subplot is cloying.",#Alive
13,Tweetienator,Mostly Solid,6,1 March 2021,"#Saraitda and its US counterpart #Alone are more or less the same movie, one a version for the Asian market, the other one targeted for an audience of the Western hemisphere. If you watched one, I would not bother to watch the other one: you can save your time and watch something else - the differences are rather minor. The Korean movie got the bigger production and better special effects (some of the zombies/infected really look ""nice""). Alive gets a 6 and Alone a 4 from my side - watching them won't kill you, that's the most positive aspect here. If you got to chose one of both movies I would recommend to take your chances with #Alive, you will get more action and more gore.",#Alive
14,digitalbeachbum,"Meh, another zombie movie",1,11 September 2020,"Zombies are supposed to be the living dead, but zombies have been so abused and misused that the fad is gone. Zombies are dead so stop beating them.This Korean zombie movie is no different than any other movie ever produced. It is a guy locked up in his apartment playing online games to find out through the news that a dust cloud has come in to the city and is causing people to turn in to zombies.So if it is a dust cloud, why are so few people getting infected when they are running through the streets? you would expect 99% of the population to become infected instantly. And why do people think that humans are some sort of awesome predator with out weapons? We don't have claws, we don't have sharp teeth. Have you ever tried to eat a raw steak? It's nearly impossible unless you cut it up in to very tiny pieces to make it easier to chew.Zombies are worthless and these movies are boring. Please stop making them.",#Alive

Il Cho (Jin and No Tears for the Dead) delivers #Alive in his third major motion picture. The storyline is very much like The Night Eats the World but not as good.

Oh Joon-woo wakes up one morning when his parents and sister already have left the house and have left nothing for him to eat. Outside something strange is going on, people are shouting, running, screaming and attacking each other. A viral outbreak has taken place, turning the people into violent cannibals, aka zombies, who spread the virus at a rapid speed. Now Joon-woo is all by himself and has to survive a zombie apocalypse. But across the street in an other apartment building he gets noticed by Kim Yoo-bin. Together they try to reach each other and hope for the best.When Yoo-bin came to the scene, the film got a new pulse. She's a great brave character, that overcomes her fears and is smart and more up to survival than Joon-woo. She gives him a reason to live, but it must have been the same for her.

23,peterp-450-298716,"A South Korean version of ""La Nuit a dévoré le monde"". Try it!",6,6 October 2020,"""I must survive.""I had nothing but words of praise for the movie ""The night eats the World"" or ""La Nuit a dévoré le monde"". A quirky film about a Parisian who suddenly wakes up in a Paris occupied by zombies. ""#Alive"" (original title ""#Saraitda"") is the South Korean version. The only difference is that the zombies are portrayed more explicitly here. About the French version, I said that non-zombie movie aficionados could watch it without worrying about leaving skid marks in their underwear every time such a hollow-eyed creature appears around the corner. This rule does not apply to ""#Alive"".When Oh Joon-woo (Ah-In Yoo) wakes up early in the morning and crawls behind his PC to continue gaming, he doesn't realize that the day will turn out very differently than usual. Soon, alarming news reports are broadcasted about a strange disease that is spreading rapidly, causing people to become enraged and attacking fellow citizens with bloodshot eyes. When Joon-woo looks out the window of the apartment, he witnesses this bizarre phenomenon. The young gamer is smart enough not to rush out of the apartment in a panic. Instead, he barricades the front door, makes an inventory of what's left to eat, and tries to make contact with the outside world. It's not really a surprise that this isn't so easy to do.The largest part of the film takes place in the apartment, just like in ""La Nuit a dévoré le monde"". You witness how someone has to deal with a life-threatening situation and how they desperately look for a way to escape this situation. Of course, he's faced with the inevitable. After a while, he is confronted with a lack of food and liquor. The fact that there's a fully loaded drinks cabinet with liters of spirits can provide short entertainment. But really quenching thirst with it isn't really recommended. Missing his family and the corresponding loneliness are also starting to weigh heavily. Contact with the outside world is not possible. And keeping a video diary only helps partially.Time to introduce the next protagonist. Namely the young girl Kim Yoo-bin (Shin-Hye Park) who lives in an apartment right across that from Oh Joon-woo. What follows is a primitive interaction between the two individuals using technical aids such as tablets and a drone. Both have the same goal in mind and that's surviving. Not that people who have a similar situation in other zombie films don't have this goal. But instead of going out and trying to find their way through a zombie-plagued society, the two sit quietly in their hideaway and wait for the right time.""#Alive"" is not very original and basically shows nothing new. The zombies themselves do look extremely creepy. There are times when things are getting tense. There are also some funny situations to be seen. Towards the end, they added a separate storyline. Some will find this disruptive. On the other hand, I thought it was a successful addition. It brought a bit of variation to the overall story. Maybe the denouement was a bit over-the-top. But overall I could agree with the general tone of this movie. Ultimately, we are now in a similar situation with the COVID pandemic. Of course, there aren't any zombies. But many people haven't left their homes for quite some time in the last six months to prevent worse. So, ""#Alive"" is more than a regular zombie movie if you look at it that way. Are you a fan of zombie flicks such as ""La Nuit a dévoré le Monde""? Or to a greater extent also ""Zoo""? Well, you should give this South Korean variant a try on Netflix. It's well worth it.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",#Alive

25,arungeorge13,"It definitely ain't the best zombie flick you'll see, but there's some fun to be had! [+59%]",6,30 July 2020,"I'll admit that the posters for #Alive had gotten the zombie-movie fanatic within me pretty excited. The urban setting, the spectacular make-up effects, the 'few survivors vs. a massive zombie horde' storyline, and the use of modern-day gadgets - I was quite enticed by these factors. #Alive has a fantastic first act - it's all Yoo Ah-in until then, and of course, the gratifying zombie chaos taking place around his apartment complex. Add some food-related FOMO to that and we have an interesting bunch of scenes stitched together.As expected, not much is detailed about the outbreak except for the basics - these zombies are fast, cannibalistic, and attack in hordes. Things change around the 40-minute mark with the entry of a female survivor (played by Park Shin-hye) who lives across the complex in another building. Hereafter, the cliches start to pile up. They develop a vibe, a couple of walkie-talkies are conveniently found, and they even end up saving each other at different instances. Yet, it's the predictably bland final act that makes #Alive a middle-of-the-road effort.The set-pieces are all racy, hair-raising, and effective, even if one feels tempted to revisit and question how certain scenes play out. With a highly animated zombie mob hot on the trail of the protagonists from start to finish, the action has a well-choreographed feel to it. #Alive, when viewed as a quarantine film in the year 2020, can also send a message across to people that all hope is never lost and personal battles can eventually be won.",#Alive
26,Abdulxoxo,An entertaining zombie flick,7,16 November 2020,"The plotline revolves around a video game live streamer's struggle for survival as he is forced to stay alone at his apartment during a zombie apocalypse.
I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it's very entertaining, it's like Train to Busan but in a room. I think we can all relate to the idea that the main character is stucked in his apartment, in his case it was zombie apocalypse but in ours, it was Covid-19. Due to that reason, I feel some kinda connectivity to the characters' struggle through out the film. Someone mentioned that it was dumb that the character broke his TV and all but it actually make sense, it's called cabin fever, when you're confined in a place for an extended amount of time, you start to feel restless and annoying at almost everything, you'll want to break anything. The characters, nevertheless, made some awful choices throughout the film, but without those mistakes how else is the plot going to move forward? I think it's pretty common in most zombie movies or survival movies in whole, for characters to make dumb choices in favor of the plot. The film become more engaging when a girl living in the opposite apartment saved our protagonist from commiting suicide, they developed a tender relationship and together, they continue to make awful decisions until they were saved at the end in some kinda Deus ex machina style.
All in all, the acting is good, the cinematography is beautiful, love the bright color palette and the score is very fitting. Definitely worth a watch.",#Alive
27,Prashast_Singh,Just the kind of movie needed at the moment: a cool zombie action flick.,10,5 August 2020,"I just don't know why exactly but blockbuster disaster movies are what I'm craving at this moment. Maybe the ongoing pandemic has a lot to do with it, but anyways, I found #Alive a highly entertaining zombie action thriller. It is the perfect movie you need to see if a real-life pandemic alone is not enough to convince you to quarantine yourself.The film wastes not a second in jumping to the conflict and the result is non-stop action. One of the best things about the film is its action sequences: all choreographed well with a lingering sense of vulnerability that makes them more enjoyable. Yoo Ah-in and Park Shin-hye are the only leading actors, and both of them deliver fabulous performances. While there's not enough detailing of the zombie disaster going on, it's just plausible because then it puts you in the protagonist's shoes: you too know nothing, except there's lots and lots of zombies out there and the only way to survive is by killing.Further, the limited setting is another cherry on the top. #Alive just never runs out of entertainment and goes on to deliver endless fun, replete with action, drama, horror and suspense. It might not be the greatest zombie film ever made, but pretty sure joins my list of some of the best ones to date.

The movie follows Jun-u a gaming livestreamer who finds himself trapped in his apartment after a zombie outbreak leaves him isolated with little supplies and even less hope of rescue, the stress of isolation, hunger, and despair becomes too much to bear but once neighbor Yoo-bin makes contact after her own ordeal Jun-u he becomes determined to survive.The movie charges right out of the gate and doesn't let up until the very end. For the first half-hour or so this is very much a one man show as we see Jun-u trying his best to keep his spirits up even as he's under constant assault from rampaging hordes snarling in streets and running rampant through the apartment complex. The movie does a great job at building upon its elements in a way that keeps the story feeling like its moving forward and also keeping the audience engaged. Once Jun-u meets Yoo-Bin we have some very clever usage of the added location her apartment with Jun-u's including a humorous scene of them eating dinner ""together"" via walkie-talkie that provides some welcome levity that doesn't completely destroy the tone. Technology and its presence in our lives is a recurring theme throughout the film from Jun-u's status as a live streamer to his usage of drones, smart phones, selfie sticks, laptops, and TVs to try to keep informed and sane throughout the chaotic proceedings, but it never feels overly ham-handed like various other movies that try to tackle the subject. In a way #Alive's approach is not too dissimilar from George Romero's take on consumer culture he satirized in the 1970s Dawn of the Dead that while funny managed to integrate well with the horror never feeling too jarring.#Alive is a welcome addition to the zombie sub-genre of horror and a must see for any zombie fan. It's an intense ride from start to finish and thanks to a brisk runtime that makes efficient use of itself there's never a point where the audience becomes antsy or checks the remaining time. Highly recommended",#Alive

All happening in small area, with only soldiers at the end and that neighbor who let them in looking a bit real. Two main actors look like they are acting for first time, or like they are not even actors. Zombies do not behave serious enough and do not look real enough. Instead like bunch of guys with makeup running around playing hide and seek game. Bit good presence of technology and emotional a bit. Feelings of desperation dominate. Reminds me of hunger, psychological, financial, social problems, and this movie just increases our desperation. Too negative.

Although this has moments of high tension and stress it balances it out with scenes full of hope and joy.The main character's here are also very likeable, which is important as you are stuck in a flat with them for the whole movie.Although not particularly original there are some new elements here: like does our technology aid us or drag us down when society collapses.

He looks over his balcony and finds the streets overflowing with Zombies so he does the only thing he can do get comfy in his apartment and try to survive on what limited resources he can find as he slowly goes crazy thinking he's now alone in the world.I personally enjoyed (The Night Eats The World) it's a very unique and interesting Zombie movie that had a lot of new ideas. #Alive while still a decent and entertaining movie just isn't as good as the trailer suggests and after having seen (The Night Eats The World) just a few months before watching this movie it just ruined it's surprise a little.I enjoyed #Alive makeup effects and overall visual style which make it a beautiful movie to watch especially if you enjoy zombie movies with high levels of blood, gore and injury detail.#Alive is definitely worth watching and since it's already on Netflix it's easy to find and watch just don't expect it to be as good as (Train to Busan) because you might feel let down by it.",#Alive
36,SoumikBanerjee25,Unique Take on a Zombie Thriller!,7,23 November 2020,"""#Alive"" takes an atypical approach on a post apocalyptic world. Fixated entirely on the survival aspect of few rather than going full on mayhem with swarm of undead! Albeit lacking in several segments, on the whole it more or less pulled off an appeasing outcome.Without going into much details about how and why, it zeroed in on the aspect of deep-rooted human instinct as survivalists. It deals with lonesomeness, desolation. Tests our moral compass in dire consequences through inconspicuous ways. It also sheds some light on the positive impacts of technological advancements and its useful application for the people in need. The interpretation here goes much deeper if you can perceive its pertinence.Technically it was a powerhouse.
The Cinematography endowed by atmospheric awareness, fastidious Sound work and apparent attention to details; collectively manage to create an unnerving ambience. Performances too helping them in that regard. Ah-In Yoo & Park Shin-Hye; both of them being credible in their respective acts.Storywise, as I stated earlier; they had taken quite an aberrant route. The plot heavily invests in adrenaline pumping moments & genuinely scary situations. With a modest presence of emotions and humour underneath which worked fractionally to be brutally honest. It loses a chunk of momentum in the second act due to a rather unsuccessful attempt at getting too dramatic. However, in the third act; it regains its predominant pace and concludes itself in triumphant fashion. A sigh of relief at last.",#Alive

The relationship between the two main survivors gives a lot of humanity to what could've been otherwise an overly lonely and depressing film.While it relies a bit too heavily on probably the most overused tropes of the zombie genre during the third act, it still succeeds at being unique enough to stand out amongs the rest, even Train to Busan.It gets minus points for having a hashtag in the title.

43,noahgibbobaker,Nothing special.,5,9 September 2020,"#Alive is a South Korean film by first time director Il Cho. Going into this film I expected an absolute mess, all I had seen was the horrible title. But I was pleasantly surprised with a pretty interesting take on zombie movies. For the most part.Technically I didn't think this film was anything special. No element of filmmaking was exceptional, and no element was awful. Granted there were some awful moments, like the editing when people are turning into zombies is laughable. And the cinematography during action scenes was also just dreadful. For the most part though the technical aspects were consistently, fine.The zombies were very inconsistent. If they are so sensitive to noise why are characters able to talk at all, sometimes when they speak it cuts to hordes of zombies charging in the direction of the sound and this is just forgotten half of the time. Sometimes the zombies are so strong they are able to climb buildings and other times they can't open a door because a step ladder is in the way. I believe this is because of my next point.Bad screenplay. All but two points of tension in this film are down to coincidence. The same scare is used many times, Oh will be doing something like, for example, flying his drone then there is a bang at the door, it's a zombie, at the same moment his drone runs out of battery. The chances of this happening are so slim. The fact screenwriters Il Cho and Matt Naylor use this stupid scare so many times makes me think they just didn't care when writing this film. The dialogue is bad and everything feels lazy.The constant references to pop culture to try and relate to a younger audience really began to annoy me after a while. From the title to the main character Of being a gaming streamer. But the filmmakers don't really know how technology works, holding your phone in the air does not give you more reception. I hate when films waste so much time trying to be hip and down with the kids. By doing this it sacrifices so much time the film could be using to develop characters or create a more compelling narrative.Overall, #alive is a pretty stupid movie that is just ok the whole way through.

A neighbor starts pounding on his door begging for help, Joon-woo lets him in, and this dude fills him in on what's happening outside: a virus outbreak that is making the infected act like, hmmm, what's the word? Zombies, that's it! And then this neighbor starts to exhibit signs of infection so he gets booted out and eaten by the hordes of walking dead outside his door, no one apparently got the memo to stay at home and lock your doors...which was actually on the TV news...but everyone just ignored it. With the little food he's got left he has to survive who knows how long. And long it is days pass with no help, and just about when he's about to hang it up, he's contacted by another survivor in the next apartment building over, which brings hope to our guy, and luckily for him she's a cutie, Yoo-bin. The two get a plan together to well get together, and when I say the two, I mean Yoo-bin, concocts a plan and executes it, she's kind of a Kevin McCallister over there. And now that they are together, they're plan to get to the roof to signal they're alive in there to the passing military helicopters.

It's full of clichés and scandalous plot holes at times, which could be forgotten if at least the writing was good, which is not, since the lack of empathy with any of the characters, due to their (non) development and the dialogues, that are empty and shallow.

60,silicontourist,#ALIVE But Alas Its DEAD Boring!,1,31 December 2020,"I have watched a heck of a lot of far eastern horror movies - mainly Japanese and South Korean - and I have always enjoyed the acting, tenseness and sheer creative style from the various directors. The only bad foreign Zombie film I have ever seen was the Taiwan zombie film, ""CALL OF THE UN-DEAD"" (2018). It was the first Taiwanese zombie movie the country had/has made but (likely due to no previous experience in the genre), it was really terrible!And then there was this lackluster, unimpressive, deadbeat dross...pun intended!
After about 5-10minutes of the opening sequences I was totally uninterested in whether or not Oh Joon-woo (Yoo Ah-In) lived or died. He was such a millennial dumb idiot who was a wired world guy and was clueless about anything, when all or anything/everything wired wasn't working. Yoo Ah-In did play the part of a useless modern day millennial very well though!After that the film just kept going further and further downhill. The zombies (whose make-up and prosthetics was over the top excellence) were spoilt by the directors choices of how they should be. They were too much in the rubbish way that western directors are taking them i.e. they are able to think, plan, organize and can run like Olympic 100 metre track stars.
I seriously remember thinking at one point that these zombies were members of MENSA :) Bring back the original style of zombies as all these upgraded ones, of the last few years in the west, just utterly SUCK...BIG TIME!Park Shin-Hye (as Kim Yoo-bin) is good in her role but has little to work with and a lacking script makes it worse. Having nobody of any worth to create tension, fear and interest made it even harder for her to do more.When you look at another Korean Zombie classic ( such as ""TRAIN TO BUSSAN"") and then watch this complete opposite of horror personified, you just feel so sad that it could be that bad.

The character is relatable and we tend to relate to him and celebrate his triumphs and groan at his mistakes. The focus of one character in one location makes this a lot less epic than the hit train to Busan, but not less interesting and tension is built well.

She is, after all, the only other living being in the high rise. So he has to go and safe her. You know how those movies go.So why is this movie?
This question ought to haunt you when you write this script. What makes your movie stand out? How about contrasting the real world with its real zombies with the fake game world with its fake zombies? Easy to kill something in a game but how about a real person? So how about having him save that cute girl, but the they have to divide those meager resources over two persons? How about making her pregnant, deaf, a lesbian, give her aids, make her a sociopath, make her or him fear heights or open spaces. And why zombies? What happens if you swap them out with something else? Would the story fall apart or does it not matter at all? Then why zombies?

66,BeanieCore,"Decent, if unoriginal zombie flick.",6,24 October 2021,"""#Alive"" has a rather complex history, for being what amounts to such an unoriginal film. A remake of an American film titled ""Alone"", released in the same year, both written by Matt Naylor. It also shares striking similarities with 2018 French film ""The Night Eats The World"". In fact, one could even make an argument that these films are all direct remakes of each other. Thus, the central plot has already been beaten into the ground, and rest assured, there isn't anything remotely original about it. Luckily, the film is well made enough that it stands as a decent effort, despite all of this.Much of the credit for it's success must be given to it's two main performers. Yoo-Ah-In is fantastic in the lead role, as a bumbling young streamer, who is loveable despite his immaturity. And Park Shin-Hye is equally good as the tough as nails, but empathetic female lead opposite him. The chemistry and banter between these two is realistic and endearing, and provides the film with it's humanistic core. Meanwhile, the fast-moving zombies are very much like those from ""Train To Busan"", and there are several moments of effective, nail-biting tension spread throughout. The only issue is that you've seen almost all of this before. Survivors trapped in a secluded location by waves of undead. The zombified family member who is kept alive to feast on unsuspecting prey. Even the infection pattern and behavior of the zombies themselves.One of the very few things that does stand out about the film, is it's relationship with social media. Much horror fiction of the last decade deals with the dark side, and downfalls of technology. But ""#Alive"" is not afraid to explore how the world wide web could be a tool for survival and communication in an apocalyptic setting. In fact, in the end, the general tone of the film seems to be one that is positive towards social media, which is an admittedly unique and welcome change.

28 days later within an apartment complex.In longer:
The director/editor makes this movie, the thrill momentum is built well and explanations are left on the roadside - which is refreshing.
What is not refreshing is bad character rationale which borderline spoils the movie a few times over. As do the a chase scene that isn't realistic and the cracking of some glass with crappy cgi (just using the sound of it would have given ALOT more effect - sound is used at one point to similar effect).
The action is somewhat good, the emotions come through even though it do suffer as previously mentioned lacking character rationale/actions, there are also some clichés unneccesary stuck into it (sneaking around collecting food would have given more bang for the time).Pro's

As when you've viewed it you can clearly see the resemblance to 28 days later (or parts of it), there are other borrowed things there aswell (as from many previous zombie movies where next of kin has become mad and feeding a zombie family member with living people), that makes it fall a bit. If this had been more about ingenuity of staying alive it would have been a bit better. Upkeeping the thrill momentum through directing/editing and acting is what still manages to keep it avbove average.",#Alive

Please don't try to present gamers in current year as ignorant when it comes down to zombie apocalypse or survival scenarios. I'm absolutely sure that any decent gamer (especially those that are somewhat doing this professionally as streamers) can easily come up with various ideas on how to survive in this kind of situation.Also the spreading was way to fast here. Apparently 99% of the local population in this town don't know how to use doors or their cars properly.Oh and I had to laugh pretty hard in one scene where explosions are shown in the city while apparently over a week into the outbreak there is heavy car traffic still going on in the city.

80,mynameritesh,"An Unique, Fresh and Engaging Zombie Survival Flick.",8,30 July 2020,"#SARAITDA AKA #ALIVE (2020) REVIEW
.
.
📜 Plot: The rapid spread of an unknown infection has left an entire city in ungovernable chaos, but one survivor remains alive in isolation and how he survives
.
.
👨‍⚖️ Review : #Alive"" pictures the familiar fast-moving undead masses and zombie-creating virus infections portrayed in famous Korean zombie thriller like ""Train to Busan"" (2016) in past. Korean movies have a distinctive touch when it comes to zombie flicks. Here zombies are more fast and agressive compaired to the stereotypes of slow zombies of America. #Alive is a survival horror flick where a Gamer Oh Joon-Woo (Ah-In Yoo) wakes ups late in the morning and the city is chaos.Ah-In Yoo's anxiousness of missing his family, the fear of the unusual environment , The way he tries to save food while he still wants to eat it, the frustration of him being alone in the apartment portrayed brilliantly. Director II Cho has added an engaging screenplay which gives you a rivetting watching experience similar to the levels of Train to Busan.Won't talk much about the second Half to avoid spoilers, but overall #Alive may not be the best zombie flick but it surely has a unique premise and a fresh take on the zombie survival genre. Kudos to the editing team to keep it short and tight with 98 minutes.
.
.
👍Goods :
1. Ah-In Yoo is brilliant.
2. The Fresh and Unique Premise of a survivor stuck in Apartment.
.
.
👎 Bads :
1. But its story lacks plausibility as it does not give details on the zombie outbreak and lead characters daring escapism skills seems unrealistic at times.
.
.
🔥 Final Rating : 7.5/10
.
.
✅ Verdict : #Alive is intriguing and unusual and is worth your time. Commercially it was a success with limited screens in June when it released in South Korea. Give it a watch.

81,alanhowden-86367,Nothing happens,4,12 February 2021,"Average zombie setup, then........ nothing really happens. Nothing is explained or explored. The whole film is set around one apartment block. there is no real sense of suspense or peril and the ending is just silly.",#Alive
82,A_Llama_Drama,#OK,6,14 September 2020,"#ALIVE is a decent stab at how the zombie apocalypse may look from a gamer's perspective. That perspective is not very interesting.Waking up to play games, Oh gets notified of some weird stuff happening. Not five minutes later and it appears all of South Korea has descended into madness and only those who weren't on the streets are safe. Locked in his house with no way to communicate with the outside world, Oh has to get creative with notifying people he's still #alive and keeping himself that way. Unlike the standard zombie, or even in Korean sister flick ""Train to Busan,"" these zombies are smart - some maintain habits from life, they can perform simple actions, and they're fast.As Oh's resources dwindle, and hallucinations of his missing family set in, the movie gets interesting in showing the horror of having to choose one of two terrible actions - risk being eaten to make it to safety (where???) or just end it with his senses intact. Happily, the movie takes a turn to the light and offers an energy boost. Sadly, it doesn't escalate to anywhere satisfying and the ending is cute, not exhilarating. Also, the gimmick of the gamer stuck indoors isn't explored enough, leading to standard ""trapped in one room"" fare.Overall, not great but has some fun moments, especially in the second act as things turn dark.",#Alive
83,MovieWarfare,generic and cliche but enjoyable nonetheless,6,20 September 2020,"After the disappointing Peninsula, I stumbled upon another Korean Zombie movie. #Alive has a simple premise in that ""Oh Joon-woo (Yoo Ah-in) a gamer is left isolated in his families apartment when an infection leaves an entire city filled with zombies"". The zombie genre is very over saturated so does this movie stand out or is just part of the horde of mediocre zombie movies.I got to praise the pacing of this movie because it gets straight into the action within the first 3 minutes. It doesn't delay with an exposition or massive setup. It knows what you're watching it for and by doing this it successfully keeps the audience engaged the moment the movie begins. For the most part, the movie maintains this pacing but it does slow at a couple of points. However, it never slows down for too long and manages to always add some new element of danger to keep the characters on their toes. The zombie action, on the whole, is generally fun to watch. They are not groundbreaking or visually insane like ""Train to Busan"" but they are generally fun looking scenes.I also like some of the ideas director ""Cho Il-hyung"" implements in this movie to make it stand out a bit. Firstly, the movie focuses primarily on one person ""Oh Joon-woo"" (Yoo Ah-in). Most zombie movies usually focus on a group of survivors with some dying but by focusing on one person it makes it easy for the audience to relate more with him and understand his loneliness. Eventually, the movie does introduce a second survivor ""Kim Yoo-bin"" (Park Shin-hye) but this adds to the theme of ""loneliness"" in this movie. Furthermore, I also enjoy that the director considered the modern setting by having wifi, social media and even modern technology like drones in the movie. It makes it feel more believable and adds some new elements into the zombie genre. The actors Yoo Ah-in and Park Shin-hye do a phenomenal job in giving emotive and convincing performances. They really sell on the desperation these characters go through.However, I do have some gripes with this movie and the first being the lack of characterisation. We the audience get some suggestions at who Oh Joon-woo is such as being a gamer but apart from that he isn't very interesting. The movie does a fairly good job at making us care for him because of his situation but it doesn't do a good job at making us really like him that much. He is very bland and generic which is probably intented to make the audience easily put themselves into his position. However, he makes a lot of really dumb decisions at time which I definitely wouldn't have done. On the other hand, Kim Yoo-bin has no characterisation whatsoever. I know almost nothing about her and they never really go into depth about who she was before the apocalypse. It baffles me why the main character never asks her about this but whatever.The third act of this movie also embodies all the cliches from a lot of zombie movies and is extremely generic which is a bit disappointing compared to the first two acts. To their credit the ending is still satisfying despite being cliche. The story is also incredibly predictable and there also very predictable jump scares as well (although the jump scares are very few).Overall, it's an all right zombie movie. It isn't groundbreaking but what it does, it does very well. It tackles the zombie genre with a clear theme of loneliness and it explores this theme well. Additionally, I also appreciate that the zombie apocalypse isn't on a country scale as a lot of zombie movies do this and seeing a more competent government is quite refreshing. This also plays a part into the theme as well. I came into this movie to have an enjoyable time and this movie most definitely succeed in that.",#Alive
84,jakerocks,A refreshing take on the genre,5,24 July 2021,"Obviously it's not Shaun of the Dead or 28 Days Later. But the English language dubbed version is surprisingly good.

86,acdc_mp3,Zombie overdose,1,12 September 2020,"I really loved the zombie genre when it came to movies. Night of the Living Dead and Return of the Living Dead are classics that get better with time. There were many movies made during that era that used practical effects that added to the cheese factor that made the movies fun to watch. The era of CGI turned the zombie genre into ultra violent and bloody shows with the gross out factor increased 10 fold. The Walking Dead was a great show....for the first season and a half. I never would have thought dismemberment and cannibalism would become cliche and boring to watch, but it did! There has been so many zombie shows and movies that have been released that all have the same stories and effects, nothing is clever or shocking anymore. I was browsing Netflix and came across #Alive. I decided to watch it out because it was released in 2020 and I was curious to see if anything at all was going to be different. Quick answer: Not a single thing was fresh. CGI zombies abound, no explanation of why zombies were everywhere, the fight for survival in a apocalyptic setting, and the ending were just like all the other zombie crap being put out for the past 10 years or so. If you skip this movie, you will not miss a thing. Do yourself a favor and watch the following:
Night of the Living Dead
Return of the Living Dead
Dead Alive
ReanimatorThese are the only movies you need to watch for your zombie fix.",#Alive

90,lord-blade,A very good zombie survival movie.,8,12 September 2020,"Not quite at the level of Train to Busan, this is a more small time movie, with more of that lone survivor feel. But overall a great movie. Definitely worth a watch.Good elements of the zombie movie genre, with the isolation, hopelessness, dread and brief moments of hope. The characters were quite believable. The story was simple but effective.It's another ""infected"" rather than typical zombie type of movie, but didn't get carried away with things like many do (no super infected outrunning cars and having super senses for example). While I do prefer the more traditional slow shambler, these infected were decent. The special effects were pretty good too.Korea's really outdoing Hollywood when it comes to these types of movies.

It was a unique spin on the zombie genre focusing on two people surviving in the silence of their apartment buildings. Yeah, there's a bit of stupidity involved, but get over it, it's a film. It did go a little bit dull in the middle but it soon picks up again.Thought the cinematography was good, the lead actors were pretty convincing (I'd advise watching it without the voice dubbing though, I had to switch it off, it makes the film a lot less immersive).

Brave of director to introduce a plot twist 20 minutes from the end but even this failed because you just don't feel a speck of empathy for the husband.

The ending is the most disappointing part of the film imo but there were some interesting moments and nice angle shots scattered here and there.

The stupid actions of the guy made this very hard to finish because I kept complaining to myself about how stupid his actions are. I don't want to watch a zombie movie to complain about the actions of the characters.Many of these stupid actions just feel forced to make something happen or to try and give an emotion response.

112,lyntonadam,UGH ! MORE BLOODY ZOMBIES !,5,5 August 2020,"There are many fans of the Korean zombie film ""Train To Busan"" & I'm certainly one of them.
Apart from a heap of gut-churning excitement, it offered a surprisingly powerful emotional angle & has rightly become a gold-standard for the genre.
This new movie has been released ahead of ""Peninsula"" ( the sequel to TTB ) & the primary hook seems to be the presence of romantic K-drama favourite Park Shin Hye as one of the leads. She's one of two normal people trapped in an apartment block during a zombie rampage, the other being a young man ( Yoo Ah In ). Will they be able to survive ? Will they fall in love ? Or eat each other ?
Unfortunately, I barely cared. With the action confined to such a small area, there needed to be a lot of creativity happening & there isn't. Despite a couple of good ideas & a few doses of tension, there isn't a lot going on in general & while YAI is suitably stressed most of the time, PSH behaves more like she scraped some paint off her BMW on a shopping trip than being zombie-fodder. And her face is absurdly flawless considering the messy/violent things she has to do. Matters pertaining to shortages of food/drink are also handled confusingly.
Actually, the thought of seeing PSH getting down/dirty as a zombie is very appealing but that's a different movie. Is there any scope for genre innovation ? How about child-zombies ? Or zombies on water, building bridges to their prey with other zombies ? Come on you writers !
I hope ""Peninsula"" isn't awful, though reviews suggest it skimps on emotion.",#Alive

Usually you get tension from people ""actively"" trying to not get eaten but the premise here or well from most of the scenes they show is more passively surviving like for a longer run thing they even show the main supposedly surviving for X days alone and going crazy for it. But it fails in that aspect. We see him have only a small portion of food left. We see him get his water cut off. Then boom we see him X days later. There was no build up of desperation for the audience to feel how grave the situation is. I mean there was even a scene where one of the main waters a plant...You're supposedly trying to survive but you decide to use your precious water for a plant???Another thing. The first part is weird. They live in apartment complexes so it's weird that all those rooms have infected people all of a sudden. And all of the residents were running outside when there's supposedly some aggressive people roaming outside?? And are you telling me that from all those room only the mains decided to stay indoors?It just hit me wrong. I feel like the leads are just idiots. And a lot of the scenes doesn't make sense. Like when the zombie horde suddenly run up the buildings for no apparent reason. They established that some of the zombies kept human actions like opening doors and such but I feel like the rare use of it just make it like a plot convenience instead of good writing.",#Alive

122,andrewhumphreys9968,#Alive - 6/10,6,13 September 2020,"Different enough to stand out from the rest of the zombie fodder, this South-Korean zombie film is a mixed bag of interesting ideas and jarring tone shifts. It wastes no time jumping into the action and the film builds its pace from there. There's more than a few conveniences to the plot and some scenes just didn't make much sense - like them not hearing the helicopter right behind them and resorting to suicide right after securing a bunch of supplies. Nevertheless, it's still worth the watch if you're a fan of the genre.The film can feel repetitive at times and there's a few cheap fake-outs. It's not hard to see the flaws in the film, but if you're just looking for a background watch or something relatively easy to get through then it is worth it. The acting's fine, though Yoo-Bin's character could've been developed a little more. I'm not a huge fan of the film's zombies, they're those sort of new zombies that's movement and noise is edited in post, making them unrealistically twitch and screech.

Its basically that, barely any talking. I could literally give you the whole movie synopsis in less than a paragraph:
boy in apartment: apocalypse breaks out, he doesn't have much food, finds girl across the street and communicates and sends food to her via rope: both decide to go and find more food together: finds another survivor to only use the girl as food for his zombiefied wife~ foe gets killed, both kids hear helicopter and go to the roof fighting off zombies~ barely makes it on the helicopter alive but does!

I basically lost hope for Korean Zombie Films. However, #Alive redeemed my feeling towards Korean Zombie Films.It's started off as normal in normal everyday life, which I this is the best way to start a zombie film. Adds more suspense and story line. Bearing this in mind it jumped quickly into the film with complete catastrophe occurring outside Oh Joon -woo's (the main guy) apartment complex. Followed by news broadcasts speaking out on the complete mayhem in the world.This film was super funny, scary and made you sit on the edge of your seat. (Well, at least I did) A girl (Kim Yoo-bin) saved him while he is trying to end his life. They make a connection and communicate from to each other from there buildings they live in.Later on in the film they both get together and while running from zombies end up both getting saved by this nice ( or is he) man.After feeding them and giving them water, his role runs sinister when you find out he just wants to feed them to his zombified wife!If you have read all this and haven't seen it then I'm sorry because you have just ruined it, or did you?

137,ZombieGirlORV,American who Lived in Korea,8,30 December 2020,"I had the pleasure of living in Korea for a few years.
This movie was very scary, but also really unrealistic.
I got to live in Korea during the start of Covid, and I got to see the complete lack of panic in their people. While back home in the U.S. people were raiding stores and trying to get the last toilet paper, in Korea we were being given gifts of food by our neighbors and realtors, and being called and asked if we needed anything by the friends we'd made who lived there. Their society listened and trusted their government workers, and I really admired and respected the way they handled the entire situation. There was no panic or hysteria as seen here, during a crisis they are usually patient, calm, and mindful. I imagine they would have gone inside and closed their doors. That was another part of the movie I found difficult to believe, the doors. It was another thing I admired about their society. They all have security doors installed in their apartments. In the states they build them so firemen can kick them in if they have to- built to break. Which I hate because of the crime rates in America. We've literally had our door kicked in and were broken into, while we were away. But in Korea we didn't have to worry about that, because the doors are ALL security doors. Having seen how well built they are and sturdy they are, I don't think any number of zombies would be able to break in... unless they gained super strength. Moving on, I can't wait to watch this in Korean- I'm still learning to speak it. ^.^ But I'm glad I got to watch it in English first. The acting was amazing, and despite my skepticism about the door being able to be broken into, it did add elements of suspense which made it that much better. The way it explored the human condition during such difficult situations was insightful and really caused my heart to ache for the characters. Well done.",#Alive

With a zombie theme, you could easily coexist in the same universe as Train to Busan, a zombie infection that develops at high speed, inexplicable and terribly deadly.
A young man is isolated in his apartment, without his family and without a digital connection that isolates him even more and on the verge of committing suicide, he will be able to establish ""friendship"" with a neighbor and together try to stay #alive.
With exactly the perfect time of almost 1.40hs and very well filmed, the doses of tension in isolation and action with bloody and extremely violent zombies are impeccably balanced.

The movie takes the time to really zoom in onto the main character(s), and therefore gives us a clear image of his motivations and emotions.

It's a slice of fantasy. It's not real and is not meant to taken as such. There are no such thing as zombies, so to be critical of their behavioural attributes is just ludicrous.

Or at the very least lacking that SOMETHING that we want in most zombie flicks.The build up of the characters were fine, and the acting was decent for what they were trying to portray, but there were a few,.... issues with how they handled situations in one scene, then complete 180 in another.The woman is afraid of heights, but there was zero hesitation to jump out of a seven story building using a rolled magazine as an anchor point, and landed perfectly fine in the middle of zombies within seconds. There is zero fear there, no tension at all. It felt like it was purely put there to make the character seem experienced in survival.Then there's a camera change to the Male lead,... who was watching the entire time and has ZERO experience suddenly being on the ground assisting her out of a tight spot. There was so little time between the frames that he would damn near have done the same thing as her!Then there's the issues with the cell phones that was thrown in your face often. Service issues, but for the longest time in the beginning he was playing games no issues. So he never once attempted to communicate using the internet? He focused on video games?I don't know. It was a good watch, and a good attempt at something that was more than just gore and blood.

The rope was straight, nothings going to slide along it. That lady has unbelievable aim with the laser pointer and why did he leave his window open so that she could see in?
The guy is just lying there, pinned down do you really have to shoot him and the zombie wife, alerting everything in the building? Why would she then try and get him to shoot her, she's not bit, there's plenty of food?

If you're a fan of zombie films it might be worth your time, although I can't be the only one at this point getting slightly frustrated at the characters frequent lack of logic/common sense in these type of films. Example, the two characters leave their respective apartments, which are seemingly safe, risk fighting the zombies down on the street, all so they can go back inside one of the apartment buildings they had just come from. What did this accomplish, other than bringing the two characters together for plot purposes? There are plenty of other examples of this sort of thing, too many to go into detail here.Add to this a few goofs and continuity errors and it makes for a slightly frustrating watch. Acting and cinematography can't be faulted, and I thought the makeup and the design of the zombies was ok. So overall, an average score, wouldn't watch again though.",#Alive

The girl is a little better but no explanation or backstory to her abilities.

Typical zombie movie except with social media weirdly praised throughout (although the hashtag in the title should have deterred me from the start if we're being fair) and nauseating tropes followed unimaginatively. Maybe I am too old to feel a connection to this film (28 at the time of writing which is odd to utter the phrase ""too old"" before I'm even in my 30s but that's besides the point) but I expect more out of Korean films. Usually they have incredible character development and depth and tell stories that are rich and engaging on multiple levels. This was shallow and superficial and ultimately very lonely in the praised narcissism of it all. In short, you may want to consider the next streaming movie on your list instead of this one.Edit: Just watched The Night Eats the World and had to downgrade this from 5 to 3.

First I thought oh no another zombie film but since I kinda am addicted to the genre and since this a Korean film just like the awesome Train to Busan was I gave it a go.
The story is super original, comedic at times, bleak as any post apocalyptic story would be but not to depressing, creepy and claustrophobic with a few proper scare jumps and a good balance between horror action and drama!

212,YesterdayTommorow,"Awesome zombie flick, thought it was very seamless",7,9 October 2020,"It starts off very quickly introducing our character and getting straight into news of a zombie outbreak. From then on our character is in lockdown in his house basically trying to stay alive and doing video diaries he posts online about his journey to persevere. Along the way as you'd expect he comes across issues with his mental health living in fear of zombie attacks, having to worry about food and water, and also as an important part of the film with his loneliness (although probably unintentional, it has pretty interesting parallels with Covid). The way it oscillates from hope to despair and back is also very effective in propelling the story and creating a pacing that doesn't bore you. All of this sounds sort of heavy handed but the film manages to address all this without being brooding. What helps is the acting of the main character who is very dynamic and lively. He has the archetype of the lovable bonehead and he portrays it really well. The other main character also has very good chemistry with the main character and acts sort of as a foil to him.The music and visuals are also absolutely excellent. Everything is really crisp, the colors pop, and the retro synth music does really well in making everything stylish while simultaneously being tense.Really an awesome movie that flies by pretty fast.

It has a good story with only one predictable part but I will get into that later. The acting was great with likeable characters and the camera/editing/sound was great too nothing that takes you away from the film.
The pace of the movie can be slow at times but then suddenly switch into action packed scenes that keep you on edge. Definitely worth a watch if you like zombie films and don't mind subtitles.Now for the spoilers so don't read any further if you don't want to see spoilers.The predictable part seems to happen in every zombie movie, they meet someone else and that person tries to kill them for one reason or another such as feeding his zombie wife.

However realistic they want the show to appear as, you have to ignore how the zombies seem to have human-like consciousness and can unrealistically climb up a super thin wire (I wouldn't even call it a rope).Other than that, it is infuriating to follow the shallow plot and the decisions made by the main casts, especially when the female lead just decides to jump out of her house and tackle a whole bunch of zombies on her own.You know how frustrating it feels when you watch a horror movie and the main characters do really dumb things?

Some have noted that it's as though no one has seen a zombie movie in this movie, but even if they haven't, the main character is a gamer, so he should at least know some survival skills.

Even though I had to accept that only three people out of hundreds if not thousands decided to stay safely indoors for a zombie apocalypse, the rest of human interactions either mean Koreans behave very anti-socially on bad days or all the drama was forced. Make of it what you will, but I really don't know which is worse.How does the fat guy open a door that only opens outward? His bones, joints and muscles would've been broken before such a door would've let loose even a bit.How does a zombie fireman pull a table via a rope so hard it knocks a girl out by hitting her hip? How does he climb up a wall using the said skinny rope? Thin ropes have very little surface area to grab onto and gravity actually does pull a man, especially a toned firefighter, pretty hard.How does the helicopter appear in the final scene? The heroes didn't hear it coming before it was 20-30 meters away behind them. Helicopters can be heard from much, much further away. Also it was flying upwards from a yard below surrounded by buildings. It would've had to have landed there or hovered for quite a while.Like that, you'll find little cause and effect from #Alive. The rest is just forced drama. It's built from events with no prior preparation, no reason for something to happen. No cause. Thus this isn't a clever movie by any stretch of the imagination. Which it could've been if it just tried.Worth watching? No.

It's relatable in a way where the scenarios from when the outbreak started to take over the city, the male lead stayed in his apartment for days. As someone who is not confident with my body coordination, I would have done the same. The story is good, it's pretty thrilling. I understand that there were times when the male lead acted irrationally, but I guess that's just how an apocalypse affects a normal person. Overall, this was a good casual watch of a zombie movie.",#Alive
245,PestVolk,Script written by a child,2,5 December 2020,"It appears decent for about 3 minutes, but it's just forgettable in every way.The main character is just painful to follow, the movie gets everything wrong that would happen in any real scenario, and the story is just horrendously bad, especially the ending.The movie uses every cliché in the book and then some.Zombies react and the plot adapt according to the characters situation, not on their own agendaIt's not scary enough for horror

And this movie was so damn bad I wish I could take the time back I spent watching it.The main character is arguably the most useless human being on the planet. How he even remembers to breathe is nothing short of miraculous. When he's not being an absolute buffoon, he's busy running around like he's filled his pants. Which, maybe he has! At this point it wouldn't surprise me if he was meant to be wearing an adult nappy but unfortunately his parents aren't around to put it on him every day.It's just an incredibly underwhelming movie. You don't feel attached to the main characters, although the female lead does a better job than the male. But by the end of it, you end up despising the male lead so much you can't help but want him to get bitten because he's so damn useless!My recommendation is save your time for something else. It's just not an interesting watch at all.",#Alive

I first intended to rate it a 7, but I ended up giving it an 8. I got cought up in the story from minute 1 and by the end of the movie I was really hoping they won't get killed after surviving all by themselves for almost a month. I am aware of some inconsistencies/omissions, but I still feel the screenply was nicely written and the actors delivered a good performance ( in my unprofessional opinion). A lot of users said the characters are weak and/or stupid (especially the boy) not to know how to behave in a zombie appocalypse; movie is full of cliches...blah blah. Ah-in yoo's character is a teenage boy, so it seems, who actually doesn't do much except for playing online video games with his friends and it's kind of lazy, but doesn't look tough and you can see him scared once he realises the situation he's in. The writer did a good job making this character relatable to a lot of teenagers nowadays. I also enjoyed that they focused on his relationship with his family...he appears to be worried about their fate and he suffers once he realises they are dead. All in all, it is a story about survival, without knowing what's going to happen next.I would say give it a try if you like zombie movies. Cliches you will find in probably every movie of it's genre.",#Alive

270,IYANN_,It's really good,9,2 August 2020,"I mean it's better than Train to Busan 2(Peninsula), which that movie disappointed most likely everyone.Alive is a pretty straightforward zombie film that has a nice structured setting to it, it doesn't involve too much action, but it always reinforces a dark and thrilling atmosphere for the audience. The suspense of it in every frame keeps you on your toes, and what I like about the film is that it concentrates on the use of modern civilian technology for a survivor which makes it one of creative aspects of the show, because you don't really see that concept in a zombie film.Most zombie films, be it Korean or Western, it always most likely ends up in a full-blown action sequence of events, it doesn't really portray the accurate behavioral details of a survivor in a ""realistic"" sense that which can be a most likely chosen case for anyone in that situation. Unlike the cliche zombie theme of getting straight to the action with a loaded carbine rifle, #Alive instead portrays a survivor trying to pull through an event that is hard to comprehend with the little resources he has in his apartment.Although just like any other Korean Zombie Film I've seen, details of the apocalypse ends up being non-existent, and not described well in the show. If you're that viewer that wants to know more about the background setting, then you won't really get a lot of helpful information around that.But overall, I enjoyed watching this show, it was suspenseful, thrilling and never really ends up boring, and I do recommend the film to whoever seeks a new Zombie movie to watch.",#Alive

275,filmfanatic20,"Half alive, half dead",5,8 September 2020,"My issue with this film is that the main character acts so strangely and childishly to the point that half of the time, the film was extremely difficult to watch. It didn't help that he looks rather odd as well, and his garish blonde hair doesn't help. This is especially a big issue because, at least for me, the film just drags so much. He acts like a teenage shut-in. It was just unbearable. I literally paused the movie several times before the introduction of the main female character.It's not until about 40 minutes into the movie that we finally are introduced to another character that survives for a long period of time (Kim Yoo-bin). I loved her character. She was smart, mature, kind, and caring. Had it not been for her, the main character literally wouldn't have survived.I do wish it was established why exactly she chose to save his life and why she didn't choose to step in earlier. I also don't understand how both she and the main character could survive for such a long period. The film really suffers from an insufferable and bumbling lead. You'd think the film's writers would make Yoo-bin the lead, since she was much more capable and charming, but for whatever reason we're stuck with an annoying lead and a great secondary lead. Last, but not least, the film really suffers because it takes place really just in that one location with the same repetitive things happening over and over. This definitely isn't at all on the same level as movies like Train to Busan and 28 Days Later; both those films outclass this film by miles. But this film, #Alive, is fun if you enjoy mindless zombie movies. Don't go in with many expectations and you shouldn't be disappointed.",#Alive

281,szarygandalf,Its not terrible... Its just simple clichè movie with some good sides,4,10 January 2021,"I will not talk about how stupid characters are, because many people did it already. So i will talk about positives, first the pictures are really, really nice, music is rare but stands on a decent level. And, there is some interesting ""Zombie Mechanics"" like grabbing survivors to horde or the fact that they remember stuff they did when they were alive for ex. Fireman know how to climb. But the issue is, the mechanics i just mentioded is using occasionally, i mean really and sometimes its just didnt work because the plot or something? Like police officer didnt pick up her revolver because Heroine had to use this later in the movie.
There was moment in the very beggining movie when Zombie gets literally crushed by other zombie and i though ""Oh yea cool so zombies will fight each other?"" But nope, thats the only moment this happens, so thats the point even if there are interesting things arround zombie mechanic its just happens once or twice. And for sure, it never happens when Characters must go somewhere because plot armor or something.So in conclusion, its not a bad movie, there is many cliches and dumb plot decisions but if you gonna lower you expectations, or you are just fan of zombies movie or korea then, you would probably enjoy this one and half hour.",#Alive

It brought alot of new stuff to the zombie genre, like bringing in the modern area into the flick and how it could have been used in a scenario like this. So I really appreciate that part of the movie. The characters of the movie act kinda smart aswell for example drinking the spilled water from the bottle, blocking the main door and windows. (but not the hallway windows) Some stuff could have been executed better.But I would say about there the movie just did not care to give a proper solution to the problem that was at hand, it was full with cliques all around that was really predictable. The ending was really terrible and you could see it from a mile away.But all and all It was an okay watch.

It's just beautiful, the colors and the scenary was very beautiful.But the acting... man the acting was amazing, I'm really surprised, in the beginning I thought Ah-In Yoo was just going to be ok, just ok, but no, he deliver an acting with intense emotions and action, same goes to Shin-Hye Park, both great actors that I hope to see more in the future.
The most negative for me about the movie was the script, It was not bad, It was just cliche, doesn't have anything new in it, but the movie is so well produced and perfomed that turns out it became a unique movie.Overall It's a great movie, if you like zombie movies you'll be very surprised by this movie, I would give a 8,5 if IMDB allows me to do. :)",#Alive

Continuation
there is a part in the film where the protagonist was shocked when the door was shaking. the refrigerator was stumble and the zombie was able to enter the room. the protagonist have to fight back in order for him to survive, however in some parts of the film the door was actually ""pulled"" from the outside in order for it to be open.
in contrary there's one zombie that was using his hand on the lever of the door to open, hence, there's a possibility that the zombie that the protagonist have fight with maybe used is hand to open it, HOWEVER...2. the way zombies act is inconsistent
i mention that there's one zombie shown in the film that used his hand to open the door, however in some parts of the film, the zombies are not mentally capable of opening the doors, they are just pushing themselves and slamming the door with their hand. it was also mention in the television that the zombies act aggressively but when both protagonist was running upon the 8th floor, it seems like some of the zombies are not that ""aggressive""3. cuts
the film is ""drama and adventure"" genre. there was a part where the main protagonist was outrageous for the lost of his family that he decided to go outside and try to let it out by fighting the zombies. he realized that he couldn't fight all of them because there are a lot of them. while he was running the camera turn in the zombies without knowing whether there's a zombie in front of the protagonist or not. the next scene was already him hinding in the corner. for some reasons they decided to cut the part where he run to hide in the corner which is very important since this is an adventure film. that little detail would help the audience feel as if they were there.4. stupid character.
i don't want to explain it anymore, i don't know how they survived, they are just stupid5 cliche villain
the guy was so obvious. i don't know but i already know that he is the villain, even when he made them eat the food.anyway, i was expecting it to be one of the best film about zombie apocalypse not worst",#Alive

313,geniejoodata,Can anyone explain the walkie talkie?,3,23 September 2020,Can anyone explain the scene where the main character makes a landline phone call to the apartment next door to save the female character by distracting the zombies but then keeps on using walkie talkie to communicate with her instead of just making the phone call? and how many households have walkie talkie in their homes in the first place? so many holes in the plot like these.,#Alive

315,kazvko,Please Read!,7,9 September 2020,This movie was mostly based off of a webtoon written in 2014 called Dead Days by DEY. So far I have seen no mention or credit given to the original author.,#Alive
316,dneshp,A Different perspective of handling a zombie apocalypse,7,10 September 2020,"What got me interested in seeing the film is the trailer. In the trailer, the protagonist is barely in any a lot of locations, which is something I haven't seen in most zombie films. As a fan of a zombie outbreak film, there's often a lot of location hopping. For #Alive it wasn't the case.The film was overall enjoying until near the ending, which I thought was a bit cliche. I would've liked to see more of an original conclusion. The acting is amusing and reminds me a bit of Shaun of the dead. I give the film its due in bringing a lot of creative approaches in a small apartment. Examples being (Fridge as the barricade, The breakdown, bathroom, the windows, etc.)But despite missing several instances of details, weird moments, and strange story plots, I enjoyed it.",#Alive
317,bboysoy,All I ask for is a zombie movie that is believable in regards of character action.,5,10 September 2020,The movie overall was good but lacked believability. A movie character that is deeply involved in gaming with knowledge of farming and violent shooter games should have useful skills that would make a zombie filled world survivable. Yet his only weapon of choice is a golf club with little dexterity and loss of years of gaming knowledge. takes the kid weeks before he decides to venture next door to scavenge for supplies. When he stumbles upon a climbers supply next door he lets his guard down and runs from one zombie. this is moments after facing multiple zombies. All I ask is that the characters live in the world they live in and use the skills that is innate in them. I dislike the need for drama and how characters are placed in vulnerable situations when in reality any common person would step up and survive. Make the situations believable!!! could have shot the man feeding his wife and kicked the door down but instead decide throw the gun aside and appear weak. Situation not believable. Real life situations will make a viewer vicariously feel what the characters feel.,#Alive

319,cucharasopera,So bad that made me laugh,2,12 September 2020,"It was a complete disaster, characters do random mistakes just to push the plot like:
THROWING ALL HIS WATER not because of a zombie just because he was angry.Breaking his TV also by anger WHY? he didn't have internet or signal so his only method to get information is by the TV.Also the main character it's just dumb when things calmed down he still had internet, and instead of searching for any survival tips or what was going on. no, guess what? he starts to play PUBG then the internet goes off and who could have thought that was going to happen? not him, when I saw this I just stopped the movie and laughed for half a minute who starts playing PUBG in the middle of a zombie apocalypse?.When the table hits the girl she becomes unconscious even though she didn't hit her head she landed on her shoulder later she looks for bruises in a mirror and doesn't even check her head also you can actually see how she dodges the table without pausing it doesn't even look real.Btw the number of adds on this movie like I get one or two logos but 5+ is this an ad or a movie?",#Alive

He was pretty much a coward, except towards the end when he met the girl. I knew it was gonna have a happy ending anyways since it wasn't that grisly. They survived but there are so many plot holes and we will never get to know if they come up with a solution, or where they're going.",#Alive
322,farhi-92040,Decent but with minor issues,6,17 September 2020,"Typical zombie story. Obviously the budget is limited so the whole movies was filmed in one city block to cut down on expenses.
Decent acting but some details were missed. The boy stayed in that building for so long. And even though he had tainted short hair. And presumably ni beard hair. His look didn't change one bit.
Kind of an obvious point...
Other things like the the fact that zombies hear noise in an apartment several levels up from down in the street. And somehow manage to identify exactly where the noise is coming from. Even for a normal human being. That's extremely difficult.
I could go on for a long time with these remarks but it's ok for a Netflix movie.
Worth watching if you're a zombie film enthusiast",#Alive

So far almost everything he did is plain stupid. It doesn't help either that after 20 days of not eating he looks good and even have his good share of energy. It has little cool details, the WIFI headphones, the drone, etc..but I'll repeat it, just even if he was the stupidiest streamer on earth, just for playing survival games he would have at least a game related idea that things can get worse and try to apply some survival strategy regarding food, water and energy. Would have been MORE REAL, and COOLER to alt least try those ideas copy from games or series or movies and fail, than acting like a complete IDIOT...and BTW so far, the zombies are far from homogenic in their behaviour and abilities.",#Alive

Overall just cringe.",#Alive
332,ItsHoxton,Seems Realistic for What It Is,8,10 January 2021,"What I love about movies and television shows are the realism in them. Sure, I doubt a zombie apocalypse will happen, however, the way the main character reacts to certain situations, and the actions that he chooses to take seem very realistic to me. Unlike other movies, the risks that the main character takes can be very believable.I chose to watch the movie in Korean since the English voiceover really bugged me. The Korean actors performed their roles very well, I am glad I chose not to watch it in English.As for the ending, I feel like there will be a lot of people that will not like it, I believe that the ending was written well. I was surprised with how it ended, usually movies are predictable but this one wasn't.I do feel like they prolonged some of the scenes. I know that they were attempting to make it suspenseful but it was really getting annoying at times.Nevertheless, the movie was written well. I could see myself watching this again in the future.",#Alive

I enjoyed this movie a lot more than the American version which was called alone. I think that this movie was really great considering I love zombies who move fast.

344,scharfenbergrobin,Inconsistency kills authenticity,5,25 September 2020,"Well, if you want to craft a decent zombie flick in modern times, there is propably no way to define the genre new. There were some really good movies and many bad ones that mostly tried to copy the already existing decent ones, but failed doing so and never tried adding anything new to refresh these types of films. Well I would go this far and say that this movie tried. It created an atmosphere, that held it somewhat authentic at first. In times where isolation and deseases are a very relevant topic, maybe more than ever, there is a chance you could hit the spot and keep your audience on the edge, because everyone is thinking about what they would do in a situation like this. And this is where the problems start with this movie. The protagonist struggles with keeping himself safe, while making dumb decisions. That's not new to the genre. Everyone who watched some zombie flicks knows that feeling ""What the hell is he doing? Why isn't he behaving like I would in this situation?"". So you obviously can't expect a zombie expert here. That's not the problem. The decisions made his character inconsistent. He went from suicidal, to a fighter, which is ok, but when he was sure of his will to live, he still let things happen, that brought him and his newly won friend in great danger. Like letting her shoot a gun in the apartment, when they clearly didn't need to. So inconsistency is what drags the movie down. The zombies were portrayed merciless through fast and violent behavior, but had an inconsistent present. One time the protagonist was trapped in an apartment with nowhere to go and they didn't even show his way back into his own apartment.. Sometimes the floors where flooded with zombies, sometimes they were not, clearly depending on the next step, the film let the protagonist take. The composition of scenes often felt too forced triggering a chain of events trying to make the movie exciting again. But the action fell flat, especially when noticed that zombies where just growling instead of running, like when the girl came down the building, landing right in front of some of them or two ran after the police woman but only one got to her and the other one disappeared. So depending on what the writers wanted the characters to do, zombies were adjusted. The cinematography in these scenes was good and so was the acting overall. Especially in the quiet scenes, when the characters had to face themselves. But all in all there was an attempt creating a somewhat ""loveable dork"" main character and let him face the dead while connecting modern techniques and pointing out how much of a topic social media could be in a situation like this, but failing in consistent execution and lacking authentic characters.",#Alive
345,aaron_67,Stupid from start to finish,3,12 September 2020,"The acting for this movie is okay, the zombies are great and the camerawork is also great. The movie does not feel cheap at all that is why I'm giving it 3 stars. The biggest problem this movie has is the stupidity of the characters from start to finish. Every decision they make is awful and just when you think they're going to do something smart they ruin it.
