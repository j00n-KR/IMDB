0,bkoganbing,Such interesting characters come from John Grisham,9,19 July 2012,"Ironically enough I saw a Perry Mason episode a few days earlier where a young kid around Brad Renfro's age comes to Raymond Burr seeking legal advice and got taken on as a client eventually. I wonder if John Grisham saw the episode and got the germ of an idea for a book.Renfro is a most wanted individual. He saw a lawyer from New Orleans kill himself and before he died he revealed where the missing body of a Louisiana State Senator was. It seems as though organized crime put a hit on him and the discovery of said body will cinch an indictment against Anthony LaPaglia the number one contract killer in the New Orleans mob.So US Attorney Tommy Lee Jones wants Renfro. LaPaglia wants to silence him. It's all way too overwhelming for Renfro's mother, some poor white trash woman played by Mary Louise Parker. And too overwhelming for Renfro who finds Susan Sarandon as an attorney who will guard his interests.Susan Sarandon got a Best Actress nomination for this film and on the strength of her scenes as a righteous attorney guarding Renfro's interests and her very tender scenes with Renfro earning his trust which was not easy. Sarandon hits all the right notes and every emotion from her in this film rings true to life.Brad Renfro was a complete unknown who was cast in the film because he was a local kid and he does come across as a real kid and very well. Half of Sarandon's nomination should have been credited to him. Sad indeed that he proved to be another young Hollywood tragedy.Down in the cast in a small part that he really makes count is Ossie Davis playing a judge who is trying to sort out everyone's rights in this situation. Davis was a great authority figure on the bench.John Grisham novels have such interesting characters they seem to be almost ready made for a screen adaption. The Client is no exception here, you will be engrossed in the story within seconds of starting to watch this film.",The Client
1,SnoopyStyle,A bit of stereotypical overacting except for the great work from Susan Sarandon,6,18 March 2014,"Mark Sway (Brad Renfro) and little brother Ricky run across mob lawyer Jerome Clifford trying to commit suicide in his car. Mark tries to stop him. Jerome grubs him into the car, and confesses the location where his client Barry Muldano (Anthony LaPaglia) buried a body to the boy. Mark lies to the cops saying he didn't talk to Clifford. The cops, the FBI, and the DA Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones) do not believe him. Mark under pressure hires lawyer Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon). Meanwhile the mob sends hit men Paul Gronke (Kim Coates).Brad Renfro is trying real hard to be a brat. In fact, he is trying too hard. He is successful in making his character very unlikeable. Joel Schumacher is concentrating on the kid. I think it may be better to concentrate on Reggie Love. Susan Sarandon does a great job and she saves this movie. Almost everybody else is playing one stereotype or another. Tommy Lee Jones is pouring it on. Mary-Louise Parker is playing the white trash single mom. And don't get me started on the mob guys. LaPaglia may as well be a pirate. Dialing it back would help sell the tension.Then there is the basic Grisham story. I don't buy that they wouldn't just kill the kid. It would help to not make the mob guys such stereotypes. At least then I would believe that these guys don't get a kill every other week. Then there is the Tommy Lee Jones character. He's all stick, and no carrot. Again he's too one-dimensional. Why wouldn't he offer immunity is beyond me. He's all huff and puff at every turn. That's really the big problem with almost everything in this movie. Everything is push up the 11 even if it makes no sense.",The Client
2,lee_eisenberg,"right before ""Dead Man Walking""",7,29 July 2010,"One of Joel Schumacher's good movies - before he got into stuff like ""Batman & Robin"" - was ""The Client"", an adaptation of a John Grisham novel. Brad Renfro (in his film debut) plays Mark Sway, the older son in a white trash family near Memphis. One day while Mark and his younger brother Ricky are having a cigarette in the woods, a fat sweaty man parks his car there and starts letting car exhaust flow into the car. When Mark tries to unhook it, the man shoves him into the car and reveals some dark secrets. After Mark manages to escape, the man shoots himself.Once the police investigation begins, Mark doesn't tell everything that happened, but the police are suspicious. Meanwhile, prosecutor Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones) hopes to use Mark's hidden information to bring down a New Orleans mafioso (Anthony LaPaglia), while Mark is tired of getting questioned, and so he hires novice lawyer Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon), who has been having to deal with her own demons.I found the really effective scenes to be the dialog between Foltrigg and Love, as they try their legal skills against each other. It was also good to show how the ordeal affects Mark's family - especially his overworked mom (Mary-Louise Parker) - but the interactions between the attorneys really give the movie its strength. Sarandon's role earned her a Best Actress nomination, and she won the following year for ""Dead Man Walking"". Too bad that Brad Renfro died of a drug overdose really young (his death got overshadowed by Heath Ledger's death a few days later).OK, so we could be cynical and ask how the mafioso immediately figured that his lawyer spilled the beans, or why Mark and Reggie do what they do in New Orleans. Despite those plot holes, I found this to be a very well made film. I certainly recommend it. Also starring J.T. Walsh, Bradley Whitford, Anthony Edwards, Ossie Davis, Will Patton, William H. Macy and Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer Simpson).",The Client
3,jboothmillard,The Client,7,12 March 2008,"It is likely that they showed this film because of the recent death of the Bully star Brad Renfro, from an accidental overdose of heroin, he was introduced in this film. But if that wasn't why it was on again after just three or four months, it is a pretty good film to watch, from director Joel Schumacher (Falling Down, Phone Booth). Basically young Mark Sway (Renfro) and his little brother Ricky (David Speck) see a man, lawyer Jerome 'Romey' Clifford (Walter Olkewicz) trying to kill himself with gas in his car. He catches Mark trying to pull out the tube from the exhaust pipe, and he gets him into the car so they can die together, and while they wait, Clifford tells him about his current client, Mafia hit-man Barry 'The Blade' Muldano (Anthony LaPaglia) and where the body of Senator Boyd Boyette is buried. Mark escapes from the car, leaving behind many fingerprints, and Clifford chases after him, before eventually stopping to shoot himself. When they are found at the crime scene, Ricky goes into a coma because of the shock, and the FBI and Mafia both realise Mark probably knows more than he says. Mark decides he needs a lawyer to hold off questioning and defend him, and he finds Regina 'Reggie' Love (BAFTA winning, and Oscar nominated Susan Sarandon). One of the authorities most anxious to get answers is a lawyer who's never lost a case, 'Reverend' Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones), and even without permission from Mark's mother Dianne (Mary-Louise Parker) he is determined. He has his concerns about her, being a woman, and later finding out about her past alcoholism after she lost her kids, but he eventually forms a trust with her. After a long while, after more evidence comes about, Mark eventually tells the truth to Reggie, and after he escapes juvenile prison, they go to find the Senator's body, not far ahead of the Mafia. In the end, the cops get their body, and Mark and his family are put on the witness protection program to a better life somewhere else. Also starring Pleasantville's J.T. Walsh as Jason McThune, Anthony Edwards as Clint Von Hooser, Will Patton as Sergeant Hardy, Bradley Whitford as Thomas Fink, The Silence of the Lambs' Anthony Heald as Larry Trumann, Kim Coates as Paul Gronke, Kimberly Scott as Doreen, William H. Macy as Dr. Greenway, Ossie Davis as Judge Harry Roosevelt, Micole Mercurio as Momma Love, William Sanderson as Wally Boxx, Amy Hathaway as Karen and Jo Harvey Allen as Claudette. From the title, I expected a courtroom drama film, but it is a good film none-the-less. Susan Sarandon was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",The Client
4,ccthemovieman-1,Slick-Looking Left Wing Baloney.,2,10 March 2007,"A spoiled kid with a bad mouth, a feminist lawyer played by Susan Sarandon and a Bible- quoting ""bad"" lawman - wow, this Liberal heaven! Man, this is a real potpourri of left wing preaching and propaganda. The anti-Christianity in this film was pretty heavy-handed. What's pathetic is that the religious community didn't speak up against this. I can't imagine if this film had the same bias against Jews or any minority. However, Christians seem to ""turn the other cheek"" and put up with this bigotry.It was a slick-looking film with a decent cast both made it so it even kept my interest. That slickness helped disguise the disgusting bias it had running throughout the movie. Of course, critics loved it, too, and it didn't hurt that it was based on a book by a famous and best-selling author, John Grisham.",The Client
5,michaelRokeefe,Intense thriller. A must see.,7,15 September 2000,"Joel Schumacher directs an intense and enthralling catch as catch can thriller based on John Grisham's novel of the same name. A young boy(Brad Renfro) witnesses the suicide of a high dollar lawyer, who is do to represent a Mafia hitman that is accused of killing a Senator. An egotistical district attorney(Tommy Lee Jones), the FBI and the Mafia all suspect that the boy, found at the scene, knows the dead lawyer's secrets. The 'wiser than his age' lad seeks help from a savvy female attorney (Susan Sarandon).This movie leaves you little time to be bored. Not overly dramatic, but causing just enough tension to see you through to the end.Also in the cast are Anthony Edwards, J.T. Walsh, William Macy and Ossie Davis.",The Client
6,sunwarrior13,This Legal Thriller Is Worth It,9,27 December 2011,"A sterling cast headed by Oscar-nominated Susan Sarandon makes this slick thriller one of the better adaptations of a John Grisham bestseller,The Client.The film stars Susan Sarandon, Tommy Lee Jones and Brad Renfro together with Mary-Louise Parker,Anthony LaPaglia,Anthony Edwards and Ossie Davis.It was based on Grisham's bestselling novel about a street-wise kid, Mark Sway, sees the suicide of Jerome Clifford, a prominent Louisiana lawyer, whose current client is Barry 'The Blade' Muldano, a Mafia hit-man who killed Senator Boyd Boyette.It was written by Robert Getchell; together with Akiva Goldsman and it was directed by Joel Schumacher,both of whom worked in another Grisham adaptation, A Time To Kill.Mark Sway witnesses the suicide of a Mafia lawyer, who confesses that the Mob was behind the murder of a U.S. senator. Mark's brother is traumatized into a coma by the incident; gangster Barry Muldano is soon on Mark's trail, and in desperation, he arrives at the office of recovering alcoholic lawyer Reggie Love. With the Mob after them, and a ruthless federal attorney trying to force Mark to reveal what he knows, Love battles to guarantee the safety of her client and his family. The relationship between Reggie Love and Mark Sway is the center of the film, adding considerable character development to plot's routine elements.This legal thriller isn't a masterpiece of suspense but it has its moments and is capable of providing entertainment.Susan Sarandon, the emotional center of the narrative, received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for playing a recovered alcoholic lawyer who interacts with the boy as a surrogate mother and a lawyer that holds the viewer's interest on the main characters of the story. Although the film was formulaic, it still is worth the view for it has a good story to tell.",The Client
7,Doylenf,The boy who knew too much...good thriller...,7,12 September 2006,"John Grisham knew how to milk the most out of a situation that has a boy who knew too much (BRAD RENFRO) about a Mafia murder, relentlessly pursued by the killers while seeking the help of a female lawyer (SUSAN SARANDON in one of her better roles). It's the timeworn tale of a deadly hunt that has been done time and time again in books by Grisham, and usually with top thriller results. While THE CLIENT delivers the goods, it's not quite in the same league with THE FIRM.Joel Schumacher shows he knows how to direct a taut tale of suspense that has the audience wondering how and when the boy will end up in the clutches of the killers. There are several key scenes where the suspense is played to the maximum.I'm usually not a fan of Grisham's type of yarns when they become too complex to follow, but THE CLIENT is relatively easy to enjoy without straining to follow the events. TOMMY LEE JONES is amusing as a crafty Southern lawyer (is there any other kind???), and seems to be modeling his role after the juicy role he had in THE FUGITIVE.Brad Renfro is impressive in his pivotal role as the boy on the run and it's all extremely well done up until its suspenseful climax. Try it, you'll like it.",The Client
8,lastliberal,"Thanks Rev. Roy, you've been a real pain in the ass.",6,16 January 2008,"This is the one that started it all for young Brad Renfro (Apt Pupil). he was 12 at the time.I remember this as a great movie by Sarandon (Dead Man Walking), who got an Oscar nomination out of her performance in a year of great movies, the best being, of course, Four Weddings and a Funeral.Tommy Lee Jones (The Fugitive, JFK) was super as the Rev. Roy, and the lovely and talented Mary-Louise Parker (""Weeds"", ""Angels in America"") was great as Mark's mom. There were many other great supporting performance - too many to mention.It was a great movie and a great start to a too-short career.",The Client
9,view_and_review,Not one of Grisham's finest,4,16 August 2020,"With two cinematic hits out of the gate to his credit in ""The Firm"" and ""The Pelican Brief,"" John Grisham's ""The Client"" was a stinker. Unfortunately for ""The Client"", or unfortunately for me, this movie hinged upon a singular kid who was a real pain in the neck. Yes, I said it. The main character was a little a-hole. Movies, even those with good plots, need to have characters that you like. Boy oh boy, did I loathe Mark Sway (Brad Renfro).Mark was an 11-year-old boy who witnessed a mob lawyer commit suicide. Before the lawyer took his own life he disclosed to Mark where the body of a Senator Boyette was. Senator Boyette was killed by the lawyer's client, Barry ""the Blade"" Muldano (Anthony LaPaglia), a local mobster and overall sleazebag.After Mark reported the suicide law enforcement as well as the mob wanted to know what he knew. He wouldn't give the police or the F.B.I. any information because A.) he was a smart-mouth punk and B.) he was afraid of what may happen to him should he say anything. To help him combat the feds Mark hired a saintly lawyer named Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon).Reggie Love had the patience of Job while dealing with Mark. She bore all of his BS and all for the measly retainer of one dollar. I don't know if she was supposed to be a model attorney or a model mother who just so happened to practice law. Whatever the case, where she saw a frightened little boy who just needed some love and help, I saw a cheeky little chump itching to get put in his place.Reggie's forbearance and opening up to the little delinquent got her into his good graces. Oh yeah, and it helped advance the plot. Eventually, Mark took Reggie to where the body was buried so that he'd have solid information to bargain with the feds with. Afterall, his family needed money and a new house for the information he had.While at the location of the disposed body, Barry and his goons showed up. Barry spotted the two snoopers and gave chase. At one point he fell, dropping his gun which allowed Mark to pick up the gun and threaten to kill Barry. This is when super-lawyer and holy being, Reggie, talked the gun out of Mark's hands lest he shoot Barry and ""become just like him."" I'm sure you're familiar with the age old argument against killing your tormentor and threat to your safety--should you kill him you'd become just like him. I never understood that line of logic, because most of the time, if you don't kill him (such as this case) you're going to end up six feet under.Reggie effectively talked the gun away from Mark, Professor X style. Now, what will she do with the gun? Barry was still a looming threat. Well, on top of being of heavenly character, Reggie had excellent eyesight and was an excellent marksman... er... markswoman... I mean marksperson. She spotted an electrical box mounted on a nearby house and shot it. Shooting that box set off all kinds of alarms and turned on all kinds of floodlights.Nevermind the improbability of that entire scenario; don't you love when Hollywood gives the protagonist a convenient non-violent solution to an eminently violent situation?With alarms blaring and floodlights shining the bad guys ran. Reggie then brokered a deal with U.S. Attorney, Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones), and we got a nice neat conclusion to an otherwise messy movie.",The Client
10,neil-476,Good film with great performances,8,22 March 2015,"12 year old Mark Sway and his younger brother Ricky witness a suicide: Ricky is shocked into catatonia. The suicide lawyer may have told Mark the location of a mob murder victim, so Mark is a possible target. Ambitious district attorney Roy Foltrigg wants to question Mark: aware that Foltrigg may not have his best interests at heart, Mark engages Reggie as his lawyer, but Reggie has her own problems.This is a good film: had it avoided the rather too obvious (and unnecessary) chase elements, it would have been a great film. Susan Sarandon's Reggie is human and believable, and Tommy Lee Jones' Foltrigg is clever, annoying, and funny - both are terrific performances.But the young Brad Renfro in his first performance is magnetic, and the film is at its best when he's running rings round the adults. His death at 25 and the downward spiral which led to it were absolutely tragic.",The Client
11,evanston_dad,"Meh, Whatever",5,17 March 2009,"Ho-hum screen adaptation of yet another John Grisham pot boiler. Joel Schumacher is pretty much my least favorite director of all time, and Grisham represents the kind of author whose books instantly give me a hankering for classic literature, so the chances that I was really going to think much of this film were slim from the get go.Good actors like Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones put a lot of effort into the material and give committed performances. But with Schumacher at the helm, trying to make a good movie is like trying to walk up a down escalator. Sarandon was inexplicably nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award for her work, more an indication of how weak a year 1994 was for actresses than how good her work in this film is.Grade: C",The Client
12,namashi_1,A Good Film!,6,19 March 2011,"Based on the novel of the same name by John Grisham, 'The Client', directed by Joel Schumacher, in an interesting thriller, that also packs in memorable performances by it's lead-cast.'The Client' tells the story of a eleven-year old boy, who, witnesses the suicide of a lawyer whose client is in the mob, and a female attorney, who, tries to protect him. Joel Schumacher's body of work is a mixed bag. However, 'The Client', can surely rank amongst his better works. He has handled a couple of sequences with ease. However, I would like to state, that, the writing loses pace in it's final 30-minutes. And thus, the desired impact gets distracted. If it had been better or should I say more crisper, this flick would've been a classic affair! Tony Pierce-Roberts's Cinematography is good. Editing is fine.Performance-Wise: As told before, the lead casts pack in memorable performances. Susan Sarandon is excellent as the female lawyer. Brad Renfro does a sincere job. Tommy Lee Jones is superb as the calculative U.S. Attorney. Mary-Louise Parker is good. J. T. Walsh is effective.On the whole, 'The Cilent' is A Good Film in all respects. Definitely worth a watch!",The Client
13,=G=,No mark left unmissed,5,26 June 2003,"""The Client"", another marginal film from the master of the marginal film, is a B flick trying to look like an A flick. Schumacher manages to wrest some second rate performances from an excellent cast and Renfro's debut is no exception. The sweaty Southern noir atmospherics don't work any better than the music which seems always off target in this clumsy film which only squeaks by on the sheer charisma and talent of heavyweights Sarandon and Jones. Barely watchable, eminently forgettable, and for needy couch potatoes only. (C)",The Client
14,thesar-2,For the Love of the Games,7,11 August 2016,"There are movies that are good, just okay or pretty horrible that contain such an incredible gem that it's worth looking past all the bad to see the actor, or in these cases, actresses. To Die For's Nicole Kidman, Suicide Squad's Margot Robbie and The Client's Susan Sarandon all come to mind.It's no wonder my favorite actress, Sarandon, was nominated for this role. She was absolutely incredible in an otherwise fun, albeit deeply flawed and amateurish film. Not a frame flew by that she wasn't 100% her character, Reggie Love. She was strong, held her own against other wonderful actors and stole every scene she was in. And rightfully so.The movie is centered around a trailer-park child (not to be mean, but boy, they drill that life of this kid and his family into you countless times) who witnessed a suicide by a lawyer who confessed his client's secrets to the boy before taking his own life. The aftermath is the mob after him, the F.B.I. wanting to use him, his hysterical mother and comatose brother and an attorney he hires for a buck in which he doesn't trustat first.Mark, the boy, doesn't know who to trust, to be frank. He knows the number one secret the F.B.I. needs, but is afraid from all angles until he can solve this on his own. Well, with the help of the motherly Love, of course.Man, do I love 90s Tommy Lee Jones (the main F.B.I. dude.) Overall, Jones is a fantastic actor, but you can tell he owned the 90s. He did great here, as did (sadly, R.I.P.) at the time, newcomer: Brad Renfro. Again, Sarandon stole the spotlight, but thankfully, was complimented by the people around her.As mentioned, the movie was deeply imperfect. When I watched this as a young adult in first-run theatres, I loved the movie. Almost every aspect. Helps I was a biased (author) John Grisham enthusiast. Unfortunately, this viewing, nearly 20 years since I last saw it, didn't hold up. From the outfits – Oh, dear Lord, what was hit-man/mob nephew Anthony LaPaglia wearing?? – to the shoddy police/F.B.I. work to the plot holes big enough for Mark to crawl through, it was a tough viewing. Mercifully, taken with a grain of salt and Super-Sarandon, it's definitely a good throwback to 90s lawyer thrillers I practically grew up on. Worth watching for my eternal goddess as long as you leave your brain at the door.***Final thoughts: The first Grisham novel-turned-film was The Firm. I remember being so incredibly disappointed in how much they changed the overall story and characters from that fantastic book. So, I was a little scared to see Grisham's second movie adaptation: The Pelican Brief. Oddly, I did a 180. With the exception of changing the secondary lead's age, physique and race (a heavyset, older white male intoDenzel Washington) the movie was almost verbatim the book and guess what? I hated it.I then changed my opinion on the movie, The Firm, because my eyes were open to the possibility of enjoying both the great book and a new twist in the movie. The Client followed suit of The Pelican Brief, as did the follow-up, A Time to Kill. All three were almost line-by-line their books. Nowadays, I see both arguments and appreciate when movies sway and when movies are faithful. As long as the changes make sense, or bring an older novel's ideas into modern times/techniques, it can work as does keeping the same direction of the original literary work.So, I bring this up to tell people, read this book, The Client. There is more depth to it than the movie, but if you're like most people who want the movie to be almost exactly the novel, you won't be disappointed.",The Client
15,MOscarbradley,It's the cast that delivers this time round.,7,23 May 2020,"""The Client"" is one of the better big-screen adaptations of a John Grisham novel and it's largely down to a terrific cast. some of who weren't even 'names' at the time. The plot is fairly typical Grisham, (a witness to a killing needs to be protected from the killers), but the twist here is that the killing was a suicide, the victim a mob lawyer who blurted out where the body was hidden before blowing his brains out and the witness, an eleven year old street-wise kid.It's a decent thriller plot and it does make for an entertaining picture but it's given quite a lift by a whole host of superb actors with Susan Sarandon taking the lioness' share of the honors, (she won the BAFTA), as the hard-nosed lawyer the kid hires. Other lawyers determined to bring down the mob include Tommy Lee Jones, J.T, Walsh, Bradley Whitford and Anthony Heald while Anthony La Paglia is the principal bad guy and there's a very nice supporting performance from the great Will Patton as the kind of policeman you're not sure if you can trust or not. Brad Renfro is the kid. Unfortunately, the director was Joel Schmuacher who doesn't bring a lot of imagination to the party but keeps things moving along in predictable fashion.

16,g-bodyl,"Very Absorbing, But Could Have Been More!",8,22 December 2012,"The Client is a good film with moments of extreme greatness especially for a courtroom thriller such as this. But there are also scenes where they should have been added into the editing room. The film was excellent in the beginning, slows to a crawl in the middle, and picks up in the end. If it stayed like the beginning, this film would have been flawless.After a 11-year-old kid and his brother witnessed a suicide, the kid hires an attorney to help protect him and his family from threatening mafia members and a stubborn Federal District attorney.The acting is very good in this film. Susan Sarandon seemed like she was born to play this role. She was just perfect! For a kid who never acted before, Brad Renfro was brilliant as the snobby 11-year-old.Overall, this is a slightly above-average crime thriller. Sarandon steals the show as her role of the attorney. Joel Schumacher directed a masterpiece compared to the Batman films he would take over after this film. I rate this film 8/10.",The Client
17,sol-,Legal Avenues,6,30 April 2016,"Pressured by an ambitious district attorney after witnessing the suicide of a mob lawyer, a bratty adolescent seeks legal advise from a lawyer who lost custody of her children during her divorce in this legal thriller based on a novel by John Grisham. Susan Sarandon won the BAFTA Best Actress award for the film and received an Oscar nomination for her turn as the divorced lawyer. It is a better performance then one might expect as she does a great job quoting the law when facing up to the DA and fighting all legal avenues available when trying to get the boy out of having to take the stand in court; it is not all maternal instincts, though these do factor into play too. With this in mind, the film grows far too sentimental for its own good in its final few scenes. Brad Renfro's performance as the boy works also against the film; he is so insolent and rude that he is nearly impossible to warm to. The film's most grating performance though comes from Anthony LaPaglia as the rather brainless mafia goon out to get Renfro. The film is admittedly encapsulating though in the scenes where Renfro and LaPaglia manage to keep their mouths shut. There are lots of thrills and chills throughout, whether it be Renfro noticing the mafia tattoo on the hand of a seemingly kind stranger, or Renfro given a scare in a darkened elevator. Tommy Lee Jones also does what he can with his publicity-loving DA character.",The Client

The heroes are two kids who, by accident, some summer afternoon, witness a suicide, well witness: in fact a little bit more. The two kids are living with their mother in a trailer, a mobile home. There is no father. They are indigent people. One kid gets into some kind of a coma caused by the post-traumatic syndrome of the event and the other hates cops, super-hates the FBI, does not trust lawyers and yet he picks one more or less by accident. The suicide is connected to some important murder by some kind of mafia and the whole gist of the case is to find the body of this dead person. Then of course the kid does not want to speak being afraid for his family. The lawyer has to support him but she cannot do anything illegal. The child is an enterprising young man of maybe 12 and he is as difficult to keep in one place as the north wind itself, except that he is coming from and going to all the cardinal points at the same time.

Anyway, this is one of Susan Sarandon's many excellent performances. And Tommy Lee Jones gleefully chews the scenery here. You might think he is overacting, but he is really playing a character that comes across that way. Brad Renfro was an excellent find for this part. I haven't seen him in anything else, though. I imagine his Southern accent will hurt in getting other roles. Current TV stars Bradley Whitford and Anthony Edwards were non-entities in this film. It's a good film, not great.

When Mark (Brad Renfro) was being pursued, I got really scared and tense. This was because I didn't want to see him get hurt. It was fun watching him fool the bad guys, though. In my opinion, Reggie (Susan Sarandon) was an absolutely excellent lawyer. After reading the novel, I thought to myself, ""This movie should be good."" To sum this up, the performances were top grade, the direction was flawless, and the casting was perfect.

23,gcd70,Everyone wants to be in a Grisham film,6,22 January 2008,"Author John Grisham is currently the hottest property in Hollywood, with his legal/political thrillers seemingly in greater demand than Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan novels. Everybody in tinsel town, from the top name directors to the highest paid actors and actresses, appears to be clambering over each other in the stampede to get into a Grisham film.The first, and perhaps best, was ""The Firm"" from Sydney Pollack, about a young Havard law hot shot (Tom Cruise) who gets hired by a mob law firm that controls its employees lives. Next was ""The Pelican Brief"", directed by Alan J. Pakula and starring Julia Roberts as a brilliant law student who comes up with an all too accurate theory as to why two High Court judges were assassinated.Joel Schumacher has managed to get his hands on the third John Grisham book to come to the screen, ""The Client"". The style is definitely different to the preceding films, with Schumacher presenting a movie containing somewhat less intrigue (none really), yet plenty of 'edge of the seat' suspense. Lacking the plot intricacies of the first two, ""The Client"" relies heavily on Schumacher's ability to create tension, which he achieves quite successfully, and of course it depends on the prowess of the lead players.Tommy Lee Jones gobbles up with delight his role of ""Reverend"" Ron, the D.A. pursuing vigorously a young boy who knows something that may help put a mobster behind bars for life. Protecting the lad's rights is Attorney Reggie Love, and Susan Sarandon is most admirable in this strong yet vulnerable role, while finally newcomer Brad Renfro performs well his part as the young boy whose run in with the suicidal, and now late, Jerome Clifford, has turned his world upside down.The entire support cast (including Will Patton, Frank LaPaglia and Mary-Louise Parker) and technical team have helped fashion a most enjoyable film, but sadly, once the resolution begins to become clear, ""The Client"" peters off to a somewhat less than inspirational ending. Not an unqualified success, however little else detracts from this third John Grisham cinema venture.Friday, September 9, 1994 - Village Centre Melbourne",The Client
24,Agent10,Dark and gripping,7,13 August 2002,"Susan Sarandon should stick with the tough minded lawyer more often. Perfectly cast in the role of Reggie Love, she brings a certain charm to a role which could have lacked in that department. And to make matters even tougher on her, she was almost outshined by Brad Renfro, who made quite an impression in a film such as this. While the film was put together in a rather conventional way, with Tommy Lee Jones playing an over clichéd character, the film is still rather gripping.

Were the police evil, or incompetent?  No.  Was the child at all likeable?  No.  Did the child have a rational reason for keeping silent?  No.  (By the way, his justification for all of his questionable beliefs about the wider world was, `I seen it on TV' - presumably we were meant to sigh and say, `How cute.') Did anything at all interesting or exciting happen at any point during the movie to distract us from the annoying premise?  Not that I noticed.After two hours' of static stand-off there is a contrived ending - the child and his lawyer don't say, `Well, I suppose we'd better do SOMETHING to resolve the plot, such as it is,' but what they do say is almost as lame.

Then I'd like to congratulate Joel Schumacher for this big direction and finally to John Grisham's novel. The story pointed out some problems as the social life for poor people and their rights.

28,shakercoola,Steamy Southern trial adventure,6,9 September 2018,"Susan Sarandon is in Academy Award worthy form as the lawyer defending a small boy in fear of his life. It's a film adaptation of one of John Grisham's finest novels. The story features corruption, evil and cynicism: a tough 11-year-old's life is in very serious danger for no fault of his own - he and his little brother have information that could harm powerful people. It's entertaining seeing the lawyer and her Client give the District Attorney's office the runaround and the film achieves a moderate suspense throughout. Also, there is good support from Tommy Lee Jones, and an underused JT Walsh. The standout performance comes from first time actor, Brad Renfro.
The Client is not as satisfying as it should be, however. Genuine, three-dimensional characters are reduced to melodrama when character development could have sufficed - the action sequences end up in action climax. The setup was so good that it deserved a better payoff in the third act.",The Client

She won a couple of other awards, but this was not her best work; still Susan Sarandon even on a bad night is better than most on their birthdays. Brad Renfro who played the kid was adorable, natural and talented. I also like Mary-Louise Parker as the sexy, trashy mother. Tommy Lee Jones played the Bible-quoting southern pol with humor and a touch of warmth.Two quick thoughts:(1) Sarandon has Bette Davis eyes, and she is building a career that might someday be compared with that of the Grand Old Dame(2) I wonder if Mary Kay Letoureau saw this.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

32,blott2319-1,Dragging things out for 2 hours is never fun,3,18 February 2021,"I've enjoyed several movies based on the writing of John Grisham, but he has ups and downs just like any writer. The Client is definitely one of his downs. This is a sloppy mess of a movie that is barely propped up by entertaining performances from Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones. When the two of them go head-to-head it is fun to watch, but then the rest of the plot has to happen and we are left to follow around Brad Renfro and his exaggerated southern accent. It seems like most of this movie is made up of stall tactics, and petty bickering used solely to drag out the plot to a feature length. Everything that happens at the end of the movie could have easily been negotiated at the beginning if people just cut to the chase, and stopped trying to scare a young boy into telling the truth. I have a great deal of trouble with the way they resolve the film, in fact, since the main character doesn't seem like someone who requires witness protection, as he will never be called on to testify to anything. As long as he can be protected from retaliatory measures, it seems he should be safe, because everything he knows has been told. But to make a full movie out of this story, the kid must be constantly scared to just say one sentence that could have been revealed early on. And, while they're at it, why not send the kid on the investigation himself to uncover the truth because we need to create an added sense of danger for the climax of the movie. It's all lame, and doesn't make for a good narrative story. While I still hold out hope that some of the other Grisham movies I remember enjoying will work for me as an adult, this is one that I think is best lost to the annals of history.",The Client

35,Atreyu_II,Interesting and thrilling however flawed,7,30 January 2011,"The premise of the film attracts. On practice, this premise is half successful and half average. There are scenes when it is good and thrilling and also scenes which it leaves to be desired.This was the film debut of a young and promising talent named Brad Renfro. And what a glorious start for his career! Not so much for the movie itself which isn't that great, but for his demanding role and especially for his absolutely impeccable performance. He was such a talented young actor, so lively, so energetic and so dedicated to his actings that it's difficult to believe and imagine that his life was destroyed by drug addiction and that, now, sadly he is no longer alive. He was 25 when he died. He was one of those ""old school"" young talents like you don't see in this generation, one of those really eternal.Brad Renfro plays Mark Sway, a boy who (together with his younger brother Ricky) witnesses a drunk and out-of-his-mind fat, brute guy trying to commit suicide in the most unusual way: by putting one end of a garden hose in the exhaust pipe of the car and the other end into a rear passenger window, and rolls up the window, so that the carbon monoxide poisoning can kill him.Mark attempts to prevent that unsuccessfully. But on the 2nd attempt, the insane brute sees what he is doing, grabs him and takes him into the car with him. The entire sequence inside the car is extremely intense. More than seeing, you can feel the tension and panic on Mark Sway: he's sweating, shivering and fearing what that crazy lunatic might DO to him. And his little brother is no less anxious with the stress of the situation. When the 2 brothers escape, the guy shoots himself in the mouth, a horrifying event witnessed by the 2 brothers. The younger brother goes into major shock.Mark Sway lives a living hell since then. He is threatened by a mafia shark with a knife in case he tells anyone what he knows. The boy becomes so frightened that he is forced to lie and even speaks aggressively. Mark swears often, but even when he swears he's cool and cute.After the beginning, another tense scene is when Mark is chased by a criminal but he manages to outsmart him. The story has a happy ending.The best things about this film are the 2 most tense scenes I mentioned, the happy ending and the amazing acting by Brad Renfro and the kid who plays his cute younger brother.

Very '90s, very Schumacher, and very Grisham. Hard to know what to feel for Tommy Lee Jones' character, and it's even more confusing as to why Romey didn't just blow his brains out sooner with the gun right there in the car!

Discovers a criminal lawyer committing suicide in his car, tries to stop it, and then is told before the lawyer dies about his defending a mobster who had murdered a U. S. Senator whose body was buried at his home. So does Mark go to the police right away? No, he finds a female lawyer and holds back the information, even when the police and mob both know about his hiding the secret information, and when he is told he could be taken into the Federal Witness Protection Program and away from his old life with his impoverished mother living in a trailer.The movie and book are guilty of the same idiot plot, and the reason for that in the book is to add a lot of social commentary, which is mostly missing from the movie.

38,khatcher-2,Strong character-playing,6,17 September 2001,"Joel Schumacher's list of films may not be very long, but the two which I have seen clearly demonstrate that he is capable of creating strong characteriology from his actors. In `Dying Young' (1991) we have perhaps the best performance from Julia Roberts, although in `Erin Brockovich' she does pretty well also. And coupled with Campbell Scott there are some intense moments. Scumacher continues with this kind of character-driven drama with the second of his films that I have seen, both twice, in `The Client', with an as ever exceptional Susan Sarandon as a small-time lawyer and failed mother and wife, and introducing in his debut Brad Renfro, who has the bad luck to witness together with his younger brother how an important politician blows his brains out. Only twelve years old when he made this film, it is evident that Schumacher stumbled on a genius of a lad, for good or bad. Renfro is so natural before the camera, capable of an enormous range of showing feelings. Perhaps only Mischa Barton is comparable. I later saw Renfro in a smaller part in `Sleepers' (1996) in which, coincidence, he played the young part of the character later played by the other Brad  the famous one, Brad Pitt. Though it would appear that Brad the younger is bent on outdoing Brad the elder, as long as the younger does not keep on getting into trouble with the law. As it is, Renfro almost outshines Susan Sarandon herself, but good chemistry keeps the film on course.Sarandon's greater experience was a good guide to go by. She was exceptional, of course, in `Thelma & Louise' three years earlier, and a year later gave an impressive performance together with Sean Penn in `Dead Man Walking'. In 1998 she teamed up with Julia Roberts for a heartwarming twosome performance in `Stepmom'. These are all character-driven dramas and in `The Client' she is no less up to the mark. She is clearly an outstanding actress, whether directed by Joel Schumacher, Ridley Scott, Tim Robbins or Chris Columbus, in the films I have seen of her thus far.",The Client

As the boy, Mark Renfro is outstanding - focused, tough but vulnerable, and funny. I was sad to learn that Renfro died of substance abuse age 25 - he was really talented. As his down and out mother, Mary-Louise Parker tries hard - it's more her character and lines that are cliched. But the real stars are Susan Sarandon as the spirited lawyer Reggie Love who gets many knocks but gets back up again. And Tommy Lee Jones, as the lead detective, is just wonderful - smart and tough and a little devious in his attempts to get information oit of the kid. Like in The Fugitive, the police are actually harassing the witness and not the culprits. In this case, the witness is a child, whose rights Reggie ferociously fights for.",The Client

Brad Renfro managed to win me over despite my outright aversion to child actors, especially the smart-mouthed kind. Mary-Louise Parker personifies trailer trash mom effortlessly. The cast is deep and extremely talented. It has the great Ossie Davis. It also has the Aussie, Anthony LaPaglia, back when he was a hunk. Pure entertainment with suspense.

We all know Joel Grisham writes a great drama, but sometimes the movie adaptions just wear you down.The story is a bout a kid who witnesses a suicide of a lawyer entangled in a huge mafia case. He becomes involved in the midst of the suicide and is given some vital information about the mafia's dealings. When questioned by the police, he denies ever speaking to the man. He finds himself a lawyer and from here his life goes bonkers. In Grisham style, soon there's plenty of people trying to kill him and threatening his life if he opens his mouth. Will he confess, will he run or will he lie? It keeps you interested, but does drag at times and that little kid starts to get on your nerves. A solid cast, with the best work done by Sarandon.

45,mnpollio,"Passable, if dumbed-down version of John Grisham thriller",5,21 April 2011,"Prolific legal thriller author John Grisham was starting to repeat himself, but The Client still manages to be a relatively engrossing novel. As typical of Grisham screen adaptations up to that point, the film version is a bit of a disappointment after the novel.Young Brad Renfro and his brother stumble across the attempted suicide of a Mafia attorney, who confides where a politician's body is buried before doing away with himself. When the authorities place Renfro at the scene, they realize that he knows more than he is telling them and the Mafia assassin Anthony LaPaglia comes to suspect as much, placing the boy and his family in danger. He seeks out the help of a local attorney, played by Susan Sarandon, to defend him against the machinations of district attorney Tommy Lee Jones and arrange for the safe passage of his family.Unlike The Firm and The Pelican Brief, no one can accuse The Client of not keeping the pace moving. Unfortunately, the changes made to the storyline, including some important motivations for the characters, have been omitted and the rationale/dialog has been dumbed down to the lowest common denominator. For instance, we are expected to believe that Jones' driven D.A. suspects Renfro's street wise youth of knowing a secret that would make him a threat to the Mob. Are we then expected to believe that Jones would not logically follow through that Renfro is not speaking out of fear for himself and his family, and that an offer to place him in witness protection would be required? The film is almost to its conclusion before the concept of witness protection is even considered and - by the climax - becomes utterly irrelevant.The film depends on Renfro giving a convincing performance as the boy and he handles himself well. He traverses the punk aspects of his young rebel and crafts a likable, mischievous kid. The casting of Jones and Sarandon in the focal adult roles is a coup. Unfortunately, the story changes remove what could have been some terrific character moments. Additionally, the film spends too much time pitting them as adversaries instead of allowing them to work together. Sarandon, in particular, is solid, but the role as written is lacking in any truly strong moments between her and the boy and/or her and Jones. You keep waiting for her attorney to really lay into somebody and wow us with her legal acumen, but the moment never comes. Mary-Louise Parker is embarrassing as the boy's young white trash mother. Sporting an over-exaggerated drawl, she spends most the film in a state of shrill hysteria. LaPaglia is just plain laughable as the Mob goon after the boy. He is not especially menacing and never seems to have the cunning to top the various other characters. Another dumb idea is having Will Patton play his role of the investigating officer in such a smirky, arrogant manner. He would be the last person anyone would want interrogating a frightened young boy.The film has some minor suspense, but it is also terribly shallow. We never really feel that the boy and his family will ever come to genuine harm, especially after seeing the oafish depiction of the Mob the film presents. The end result is a couple of solid performances, particularly notable work from Renfro, but it never truly crackles to life and becomes the rousing legal thriller that it seems to want to be. However, if you are a Grisham fan, you will probably find this film version fits the bill better than Hollywood's earlier attempts at adapting his work.",The Client

50,canuckteach,Flawed presentation of a good Grisham book..,6,4 April 2010,"I recently re-discovered the Grisham novels, and started 'The Client', recalling that I had detested the film back in 1994, despite great expectations, considering the presence of Tommy Lee Jones and Susan Sarandon.Lo and behold: it came on an obscure cable network and out came the VCR tape (low-tech, huh?).. the first ten minutes were passable, with the dialogue sticking close to the novel. Once the police and the 'Reggie' lawyer character, portrayed by Susan Sarandon, got involved, I recalled why I was so disappointed 16 years ago.Others here at IMDb have commented on the improbabilities of the story, as it unfolds. My complaint is the pacing and editing. Scenes should develop character or move the plot forward -- preferably both. Once the wayward boy decides he needs a lawyer, let's get on with it. At the hospital where the comatose little brother drools, we get endless and needless bickering, and nasty accusations hurled at 'Reggie' by the boy and his mother. He runs away. He comes to Reggie's house and yells some more. I woulda tossed his butt out. But (oh, it's so sweet) they get to know each other! The bad guys watch menacingly from the street. In fact, periodically, the bad guys pop onto the screen for a few seconds to relate their intention to 'off' the kid (just so we remember this is a suspense film). Then, we're back to Reggie & the streetwise kid to fend off the bad cops/attorneys (who want to coerce him to talk), or to dodge the inevitable bad guy in the elevator or the waiting room. What a mess. After an hour, we are nowhere.Proper directing and editing includes 'selling' the plot, despite its misgivings. Consider another Grisham yarn, 'The Pelican Brief', a good novel and screenplay. We could believe that a gifted law student could devise a credible theory on who would benefit from a couple of high-profile 'hits' - and that people in high places would want to keep the 'brief' away from the press. As soon as the 'law student' finds a journalist to assist her, they work together to dig up the evidence and dodge the bad guys.'The Client' just never convinces us of its premise, and focuses on selling Susan Sarandon's homey, helpful sympathetic desire to help these ungrateful, ill-mannered working-class losers. I'm not buying it. If the film moves along briskly, and builds suspense, I can forgive some improbable plot points or clichés. Not this film. Why the Director or Editor thought we wanted to hear 'Reggie' blubber about her rehab, and lost family, I don't know. But blubbering is NOT moving the plot along, nor does it really develop character.I'll finish the novel - the VCR tape still sits at 60 minutes.",The Client
51,HelloTexas11,"good book, great cast, so-so film",6,30 March 2008,"'The Client' certainly has a lot going for it. All the required elements are there for a top-notch thriller: great source material (a best-selling novel by the reliable and successful John Grisham), a first-rate cast that deliver uniformly fine performances, and all the ace production values one expects from a big-budget film. That the movie comes up short in odd ways is a shame. Newcomer Brad Renfro is excellent playing Mark Sway, an eleven-year-old backwoods kid whose family could be unkindly but accurately described as 'trailer trash.' His mother Dianne (Mary-Louise Parker) has trouble holding on to any kind of job; Mark is a lot older than his years would indicate, having to look after his younger brother Ricky a lot. One day the brothers witness a man commit suicide, but not before he has told Mark about the body of a U.S. Senator, key evidence in a murder trial about to start, and that it is buried where no one can find it. A Mafia hit man is responsible and will likely go free if investigators can't locate the body. For the rest of the film, Mark is chased by the Mafia and threatened by the prosecutors (led by Tommy Lee Jones as Roy Foltrigg). Along the way, Mark recruits a lawyer, Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon) to assist him. The problem with 'The Client' is an inconsistency in Mark's motivations over the course of the film. One moment he's intimidated, the next he's defiant, then back and forth, back and forth. One might argue that he's just a kid and he's confused, but that's not how the character is put forward. As portrayed by Renfro, Mark is amazingly resourceful, clever and street-smart, a thirty-year-old in an eleven-year-old's body. It's hard not to get the impression that his various stalling techniques in revealing the corpse's location are simply a plot device to prolong the film. It's too bad too, because the movie doesn't shortchange when it comes to interesting passages and dialogue exchanges where the characters interact in revealing ways, as well as a nifty and funny courtroom scene with Ossie Davis presiding. Tommy Lee Jone's character is essentially the same as the one he portrayed in the previous year's film, 'The Fugitive,' with just a few minor differences. Jones has probably gotten more mileage from a single facial expression than almost anyone else. It's one that seems to indicate he would just as soon slit your throat as say hello to you. Eventually, attorney Love gets Foltrigg to agree to put Mark and his family in the Witness Protection program which, apparently, could have been achieved at the beginning but then we would have had a thirty-minute film. The ending is very abrupt; no sooner has Love told him where the body is than Foltrigg holds a press conference to announce the case has been solved. He doesn't even bother to verify the body is where it's supposed to be. It's a strange ending to a mixed-bag of a movie.",The Client
52,pawebster,Boy hero saves the day,7,27 August 2009,"This could have been a children's film: boy hero outwits authorities and beats villains. Such is the predictable plot. Others have pointed out that the story rambles pointlessly and could easily have been shortened to half an hour. To make matters worse, the film becomes schmaltzy in the last ten minutes.Tommy-Lee Jones and Anthony LaPaglia both overplay ridiculous caricatures. In fact all the baddies are like something from a kids' comic.However, all this nonsense is saved by two performances. The best one is that of Susan Sarandon, who is just great in this - especially in her early scenes, in which she wipes everyone else off the screen.Brad Renfro is also amazingly good as the boy. Not many child actors could have carried off this difficult part. He manages to do this without sentimentality.It's worth a watch, but don't spend money on it.",The Client

Brad Renfro makes a great debut; ably accompanied by pros Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones.<Spoiler Warning>My fav scene is the interview scene, where Brad Renfro's character goes to see the prosecutor played by Tommy Lee Jones.  At the end of it Tommy and his aides are all cockeyed sure and self-congratulatory of themselves; and then Susan Sarandon walks in.  It's a really great set-up and a true highlight of the story.

55,arthurclay,Another pretty good John Grisham film,9,4 May 2005,"I have to say I liked this one better than The Pelican Brief but not as well as The Firm so it is middle of the road as far as Grisham movies go. I don't care too much for Susan Sarandon I feel she's a good actress but I have a hard time connecting with her characters or feeling truly captivated by them even though this particular character was one of her better and more complex ones. The story is a little boy and his brother witness the suicide of a prominent criminal defense attorney but not before he confesses a dangerous secret to the older child. It turns out the lawyer was under investigation by the Department of Justice because he knew something he shouldn't have and it is something that certain nefarious people don't want anyone else to know. Tommy Lee Jones plays a hard-nosed, flashy, and somewhat slightly unethical federal prosecutor who knows that the kid knows something important and that he needs to get it out of him before the kid is killed. The kid reaches out for Sarandon's character Reggie Love, who is a third-rate washed up chain smoking former alcoholic attorney, to keep him safe from the DA and the organized crime group who wants him silenced. Love is actually quite intelligent and competent but also in for a bumpy ride as the kid is a prolific pain in the butt and uncompromisingly stubborn. But she knows he is hiding something that is of extreme importance and he will be eliminated if she does not find out what it is and keep him safe in the meantime. This film does have many big name stars attached to it and the plot is terrific. I really liked Ron Dean's small role more than anyone else's I felt it was the most memorable one of all. The Client is not extremely exciting or action filled but it does have a cool ending and would make a worthwhile addition to anybody's DVD collection.",The Client

58,BlueSkies765,Top-notch thriller,10,14 March 2020,"Probably a bit nostalgic when it comes to this movie. It's from my childhood so seeing this type of movie was a new experience and made an impression. It was one of my favorite movies from my childhood.However taking the nostalgia goggles off there are things universal about the movie. The performances were amazing. Not only is this movie very well-written, every actor made their character memorable.Obviously the star of the movie is Brad Renfro. His death is tragic. And reading new articles from 2018 and 2019 makes his life story even more tragic to know he always had a troubled life. He was a great talent. He delivered an amazing performance in this movie, probably one of the best performances ever by a child actor. What makes it even more impressive is that he had no acting experience prior to this movie! Brad steals the show.All the other actors have memorable performances too. The mob guys are believable as clever meanies who are always close on the trail of Mark, to the witty prosecutor and his team to his smart lawyer who Mark connects with the most. They're all memorable characters with depth and keep you captivated the entire movie.A great edge of your seat thriller of a smart kid who becomes the target of the mob and is in a continues battle to survive. Not a movie focused on a high body count, but is more focused on realism, something that could actually happen where every action could have serious consequences. With Mark being a street-smart kid who's in a cat and mouse game with the mob and the prosecutor for the survival of him and his family. As someone who works in the legal field, it's interesting to see a bit of legal drama in the movie. Glamorized but also recognizable.The best part of the movie is the relationship between Mark and Reggie. The movie gives the characters plenty of depth. Everybody got a backstory. Like Mark is a poor kid, his mother can't afford to pay for the hospital bill. The family doesn't have anybody and Mark's lawyer, Reggie understands Mark the most and a great friendship starts. Even though Mark is a very smart kid he needs Reggie who protects him in certain situations.Overall a movie with great memorable characters, great interactions and keeps you on the edge of your seat. One of my favorites.",The Client

A young boy and his even younger brother slip off from school to indulge in youthful frivolities, and end up as witnesses to a Mob lawyer's suicide. The legal authorities are able to place the youth at the scene of the death, and they suspect the lawyer may have revealed some evidence about a murder that has gone unsolved. The mobsters in the city suspect this too, and the boy is caught between a rock and a hard place, wondering where to go to get help, and to stay ahead of the criminal elements stalking him and his family.Enter in the scene of total chaos two folks who are attempting to help the boy with his problem. Susan Sarandon has the role of a lawyer willing to risk her career for Ricky, the youth, and Tommy Lee Jones plays an ambitious federal prosecutor anxious to use Ricky's testimony to further his own career. Susan's character takes Ricky under her legal protective wing, as it were, and the two square off in an effort to make the young client, Ricky, turn evidence over to them. Ricky is determined to protect his family before doing anything to help the authorities.It's a superb suspense thriller, based on the John Grisham novel of the same name, and both Jones and Sarandon turn in great performances. The movie also benefits from support cast members such as Ossie Davis, Anthony LaPaglia, and as ""The Client"", Brad Renfro. Renfro shows some talent, and one hopes that he hasn't wasted the chance to have a good career.

61,Juan_from_Bogota,"Grisham Thriller, Good as Always!",7,3 May 2007,"I had a really good time watching this good Grisham's thriller; there are a few thing that putted together make of this movie a good one!: (1) A good script; with Grisham sign on it, is captivating, tense and thrilling. (2) A good cast, with an outstanding acting of Susan Sarandon and a good acting performance of Tommy Lee Jones. (3) Great cinematography (4) Good directing of Joel Schumacher that combine all of the previous. The only thing that i didn't liked much was the acting of the boy Brad Renfo, it was obvious that he is a rookie actor; he doesn't show any emotion during the film, even in the most tense situations, but i respect this, Grisham wanted to look this way; i simply didn't liked it.ABOUT THE MOVIE: Brad Renfo plays the role of Mark Sway, a boy who don't live in the best economical conditions, who liked to sneak outside his house, one day, with his brother Ricky (David Speck) they saw a man that wanted to commit suicide, an attorney, who before killing himself told Mark that he knew where Barry ""The Blade"" Muldano (Anthony LaPaglia) hide the corpse of a killed senator; later, he and his brother witnessed the suicide. The story of Mark here became tense as the Police and the news describe him as witness, and the mafia of ""The Blade"" try to find him, thinking that he knows something; Mark don't wan't to declare what he knows to the police, leaded by Reverend Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones) and he finds an attorney, Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon) who protect him.

64,fishermensmell,"Overlook the plot-holes, cliches and pantomime villains and you've got... well, a pretty bad film",4,16 August 2021,"A very good cast is squandered on this absurd story that finds a young boy (Mark) caught in the midst of legal skullduggery between the FBI and the mafia.The mafia characters - some of the most clownish mob stereotypes I've yet seen on screen - assume that their suicidal lawyer blabbed details about a high-profile murder to Mark before shooting himself and so pursue him with the competency of Home Alone's wet bandits. On the opposing side, you have Tommy Lee Jones, putting in a solid and enjoyable performance as a charismatic but duplicitous DA, driven to make Mark testify. Mark's only ally is Susan Sarandon's Reggie Love, a small-time lawyer intent on protecting her client.The best scenes focus on the cerebral chess between Sarandon and Jones' characters, negotiating, using and abusing the various legal tools at their disposal. Reggie and Mark's chemistry is also enjoyable and there is some fun, snappy dialogue between the two.Sadly it all goes off the rails and into the realm of the implausible when Mark decides the only way to ensure his entry into the Witness Protection programme is by verifying the location of the murder victim's body himself, a scheme that Reggie goes along with, and soon the pair are poking around at night in Goonies-like fashion, digging up the maggot-riddled body in the boathouse and evading the bumbling bad guys! This film tries to take two bites of the cherry being a serious legal drama AND a boys' own adventure romp, but sadly the latter undermines the former and it's all too silly to be taken seriously.Still, it was an easy to watch film and most viewers will get a kick out of the strong central characters and performances.",The Client

The scriptwriters should be shot (figuatively--not literally). They have the kid talk and act like he is an adult. What were they thinking? Scenes are too long and drawn out when they have already made their point.Tommy Lee Jones' accent is overdone and obnoxious at the start. Later he tones it down. The scenes with the bad policeman harassing the kid are so poorly done and drawn out that it becomes cartoonish.Some of the females are nice.

69,numberone_1,Great!,9,28 February 2005,"OK, so I acknowledge Susan Sarandon is my favorite actress of contemporary times (have you ever seen her in a bad role?). I further confess to having a penchant for political-legal-type dramas/thrillers, and I will even go so far as to say that movies with Southern lawyers have a special fascination to many (Atticus Finch, anyone?), perhaps because portraying Southern politics tackles greater sociological and civil issues that would otherwise carry less meaning.The Client is one such movie, and my favorite Susan Sarandon role. A great credible story, alternately epitomizing Southern politics while also placing the lead character as one who comes from that politic yet challenges it at every turn. Sarandon pulls this off beautifully as Reggie Love - in a world of men, particularly white southern men, she is somewhat weary of the cronyism to which she will never belong, yet solid enough in her own strength and belief in her convictions to hold her own against the mean ones.Great story, but if you've not seen it recently, watch it again, and particularly focus on Sarandon - approach it with these comments in mind, noting how she's totally ""on"" with this character and that character's surroundings, it'll add to the film's multi-dimensionality.",The Client
70,PL1981,A disappointingly bad adaptation of an excellent novel,1,31 July 2009,"The movie adaptations of John Grisham's novels, with the possible exception of the ""Rainmaker"", have quite frequently proved disappointing and unfulfilling so perhaps I should not have had such high expectations going into this movie. I guess the reality was, however, that I loved the novel and was confident that it could translate well onto the big screen I was sadly disappointed The movie lacks all the charm, depth, humor and warmth of the novel which made the latter so appealing. For reasons that totally elude me, the producers/writers decided to include totally unnecessary scenes and create unnecessary tensions between the major characters that are just annoying and irritating to the extent that they make the movie unpleasant to watch and erode much of its potential quality. The humor and dialog that worked so well in the novel falls flat in the movie Additionally of the characters in the movie seem to have been stripped of the depth and dimension that made them so interesting and engaging in the novel The acting is not much to go by. I can't accurately judge Brad Renfro as an actor because he's not given much to work with. Susan Sarandon is superb in everything she does but even her stellar performance can't add much charm to this film. Mary Louise Parker has given some great acting performances in her time but she is appallingly miscast in this film as Mark's mother.

Why do the Police AND the FBI, who are clearly eager for information about the whereabouts of the body of the senator, intimidate a 11 y.o. boy by giving him the feeling he commited a crime? This whole situation could've been resolved by a sensible prosecutor: Ask for the information and offer witness protection. Case closed.

Saying that though even for when this movie was made the outstanding mistakes made by the legal part of this movie is beyond me. First off you have a cop intimidating a child witness which makes no sense, second when Mark was first brought in to talk to the lawyers they never would have anyway interviewed him without his mother because any defense lawyer would then tear apart the kids statement as soon as he took the stand and have all evidence thrown out of court, thirdly this is all based on what the lawyer might have told the kid which considering there is no proof they could ever possibly know what was actually talked about in the car all, all mark had to say was the guy just talked about wanting to die and the FBI could never prove otherwise and everything would once again be thrown out, fourth and finally even if Mark admitted that the lawyer told him something the FBI couldn't do anything with it because it is hearsay and also it broke client confidentiality as soon as the lawyer told Mark so it in no way could have been used as evidence and any evidence gotten from it would become invalid and not usable in a court of law.

Especially Tommy Lee Jones, a personal favorite, plays his part well, and his scenes with Sarandon are the best part of the film. They keep testing each other and have some verbal clashes but in the end you can see Jones' character isn't as bad as he seems and he clearly respects Sarandon's efforts. Only negative comment for this movie is that it never seems to reach the suspense it is aiming for and so it becomes good entertainment for one evening but forgettable soon after.",The Client

84,turbomr2,Nice Plot!,9,21 January 1999,"I really liked the script to this movie, in addition to the casting.  One can always see those little quirks of characters like Tommy Lee Jones, somewhat like Christopher Walkin.  The way he faces away from people when he talks, and seems to move and talk simultaneously as though there is almost no one listening but himself. I also liked the casting of Brad Renfro, who looks cute in his younger years, as a contrast to his age in The Cure.  The bond between Mark (Brad), and Reggie (Susan Sarandon), is really touching, but I kinda wish the ending had including a rejoining with her children, as she has not lost the bond with Mark as well.  I guess not every movie has to have circuitous completion.  I still like this movie a lot, and would recommend it to anyone who isn't looking for the most complicated of legal situations that cannot be understood by the viewer.",The Client
85,roccotom,"The Best Grishem on film to date, by far",9,5 July 2000,"This is the best of the Grishem adaptations, chiefly because of the superior acting of then newcomer Brad Renfro, Tommy Lee Jones, and the always brilliant Susan Sarandon.True, the plot has some holes and the villains come across as uninspired, but the interplay between Sarandon and Jones is always fun to watch, and the sometimes tender scenes between Renfro and Sarandon are surprisingly believable (considering this was Renfro's first role, it is amazing how well he holds his own with Sarandon, one of the greatest talents in film history.)This movie grabs hold of you from the beginning and really never lets up, with wonderful and memorable scenes throughout--the first meeting between Jones and Sarandon being one of the many standouts.  A fun movie that holds up well with repeated viewings--something not that common with thrillers.",The Client
86,swicinski,Really?,3,14 July 2013,"I finally sat down to watch this. I'm not big into 'lawyer' movies, and this plot never made much sense, but it got three stars on the tivo, so I said ""sure, why not"". First off, to be clear, I never read the book, nor have I read any Grisham novels.I never got the plot. Kid somehow finds out 'important' information, but won't tell anyone. Sounds, um, reasonable, sure. He then races to find a lawyer (and he doesn't trust lawyers) in order not to say anything. And I'm still not sure what the lawyer did for him, except get his family out of Memphis (which the DA should have been doing immediately).I couldn't stand ANY of the characters! Mark Sway just swore a lot and didn't have a clue what he was doing (and some people call him the 'hero'!). Not sure what Reggie the lawyer was trying to protect the boy from, for she seemed far more concerned over the law then the bad guys.The Barry 'the Blade' character made me wonder whether he was some guy who was posing as a mob killer, and thought that's how they dressed and acted. For he seemed as far from realistic as one could get. The cop that finds Mark has got to be one of the worst cops in Memphis. Kid finds body, you think he's hiding something. So the obvious way to get him to talk? Of course, try to scare it out of him! It always works!The federal agents seemed to be about as inept as possible. The DA made me wonder why anyone would pay attention to him, let alone the media. The family is in the hospital under police watch, but there's a detective down the hall watching the room? How does that happen? Speaking of the media, how about the supposed newspaper reporter. Taking pictures of the kid in the hospital room? Really? And the newspaper not only gave out his name, but printed a big picture of him?Finally, this is all about 'finding the body of the senator', but they never explained WHY that was important. A body is just a body. Sure, it can show the senator is truly dead. But not once did we hear ""If we can find the body, we're sure to find proof that the blade did this!"". Let alone, why would they think they could find it? Had they ever found any of his other victims? And did those not help send him to jail?Oh, and I didn't even get to the part where they go to NO to find the body for some insane reason. Anyone who thinks this is even a good movie needs to watch some good movies. Watch the Shawshank Redemption, and then watch this, and you'll see what I mean.",The Client
87,davidpixley62,Totally unrealistic,6,1 September 2021,"Two simple problems. 1: An 11 year old kid would never have the balls, experience or stamina to stand up to the system. Give me a break.2: The judge would never let a lawyer step up and lean on the bar and stick his face 3' away from an 11 year old to badger and intimidate.There is much more. But those two film choices make me say, come on man!",The Client
88,marcinbloom,Amazing courtroom thriller,9,21 August 2020,The people who will love a great courtroom drama / thriller will really love and enjoy this film it has everything you would love in a great thriller. The actors and casting is amazing and I will say I found it highly suspenseful where it almost made me feel anxious! It is in the classic genres to me I will definitely recommend this film to everyone who enjoys great films of the thriller types. Tommy Lee Jones and Susan Surandon are incredible in this and the young leading actor aswell. Amazing.,The Client

93,homeimp,A great suspense thriller,9,14 February 2005,"A slick and smart thriller that has you rooting for the good guys all the way. Brad Renfro makes an extraordinary debut as the young hero, resourceful, tough, humorous and longing for a chance at a better life. Susan Sarandon's Oscar nomination was well deserved, creating a moving portrait of a middle-aged woman, abandoned by her children, trying desperately to pull her life together. Tommy Lee Jones plays, well, Tommy Lee Jones, and who does it better? One of the best, if not the best, of the Grisham adaptations. Wonderful cinematography along the way, and an evocative score by Howard Shore. Kudos to Joel Schumacher, one of those directors who critics constantly demean with a sarcastic remark, vainly attempting to pass it off as intelligent commentary.",The Client
94,mollybunny15,"Well Done, Brad!",9,17 July 2006,"This is a well written, well directed movie with excellent acting from not only well-known Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee-Jones, but also by newcomer Brad Renfro. Renfro plays young Mark Sway, a rebellious eleven-year-old who skips school to take his brother on a hike in the woods. a day of fun mischievousness turns into a nightmare when the boys witness the suicide of a Mafia attorney. Enter Rev. Roy Foltrigg, played very well by Jones, who is determined to get the truth from the youngster, and Reggie Love, Sarandon, who risks her career - and her life - to help him stay one step ahead of Foltrigg and the Mafia, and to stay alive. I was extremely impressed with this film, and watch it all the time. At points, it feels that Tommy Lee-Jones is overacting, but I think that it is the character's personality. I would recommend this movie to all!",The Client
95,white_flag-16,'Bout Mark Sway!,10,22 January 2007,"i like that kid, Mark hes like hot even though hes like around his mid/late 20s i think he was really cute and hot in that movie The Client, he was like a gangster boy acting all oh I'm cool i cant be seen with you. my favorite lines were these: Lady At Desk: what do you want boy? mark: i need to see Mr. Beale. lady: where are your parents? mark: where are yours? lady: well... we only do the injured. mark: Wellll... I'll just go get hit by a truck and come back. me and my friend burst out laughing at that scene and re-wound the movie so we could watch that part again. another favorite part of mine was: Reggie: you want a lawyer? Mark: i want a lawyer, i hate lawyers, i said i need a lawyer",The Client
96,jvberens,Hope the Novel was better than this,5,19 July 2020,"I love Tommy Lee in most of his works. Sarandon makes a pathetic lawyer. I'd much rather have a lawyer with cool than the always too dramatic and bi-polar Sarandon. Then the dead eye shot she makes near the end so poor Mark doesn't have to shoot the bad guy was totally unbelievable. Add to all this the fact that I hate movies with smart-alek kids always showing up all the adults in the room. We adults are sure a bunch of numbskulls, aren't we?",The Client
97,margiedempsey333,Some major offbeats,3,15 December 2012,Lots of overacting and horrible fake Southern accents. A bit of ridiculous stuff in an otherwise good movie. Why can't they find Southern people to play these parts? Why do they insist on using actors and actresses that probably have never been to the South? We don't talk that way down here. We just DON'T! Watching it threw me off. The only real diction and pronunciation was the black judge; he was great. Real. Watching Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones act Southern is painful. I have to go on because I'm supposed to write at least ten lines of content but we Southerners don't need to rattle on to make a point. The bottom line for Hollywood: hire Southern actors to play Southern-based roles!,The Client
98,USA_original,Such a classic movie...,10,10 October 2004,"Over the summer, I saw this movie for the first time. It was automatically one of favorites. And, actually, this is not my usual ""type"" of movie, either. I usually go for more light-hearted, romantic comedies. But this movie was definitely worth watching. After seeing it once, I ordered it on DVD and have watched it countless times since then. The acting in this movie is awesome, and it always keeps you interested. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It's not a kids movie, though. Susan Sarandon has always been one of my favorite actresses, and she excels in this movie. This part was perfect for her. Overall, I gave this movie a 10/10. If you haven't seen it, trust me..it deserves it!!! Thanks, USA_original",The Client

100,me-30-242891,A Disappointing Adaptation,4,17 September 2014,"I realize that a film does not need to, and in many cases should not, slavishly follow the book from which it's derived. But the screenwriters on this film would have done well to pay more attention to how Grisham built the personalities of his characters. These were not the people who made the novel such a great read. I didn't care about them nearly as much, and the interpersonal tensions between characters were often added as an easy way to put conflict in individual scenes, while taking away from the overall conflict and suspense of the story.I felt the same way about action sequences in the story. They just felt like cheap shots, and didn't advance the plot or my understanding of the characters of the situation.Trying to consider this as a standalone movie, without considering the book, it still feels forced and contrived. I can't fault the actors for this; I think they did the best with what they had. But the screenwriters, and to a lesser extent the director, really let me down.",The Client
