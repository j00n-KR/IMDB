0,bkoganbing,Semper Paratus,10,18 October 2006,"The film The Guardian turned out to be a lifesaver for me in a way. I went to see it yesterday and forgot about the blackout that was crippling Buffalo for five days.I was expecting to see another version of young cocky recruit in the hands of old professional which has been done innumerable times in film. I was pleasantly surprised to see some real character development for those stereotypes.Kevin Costner is the old pro here and he's been doing a job he loves for over 20 years as a rescue swimmer for the United States Coast Guard. But he's slowing up now and won't face the fact he's aging. He also was the only survivor of a rescue mission that in itself went down. He's reassigned temporarily as an instructor to train new rescue swimmers.The top prospect at the school is a cocky kid played by Ashton Kutcher who was a high school swimming champion. The two of them clash, but then bond quite dramatically as Kutcher tells him of some demons haunting him as well. For those of you who think of Ashton Kutcher as the lovable sexy lunkhead Michael Kelso from That Seventies Show you are in for a real shock. He turns in quite a good performance in a role that is miles away from Michael Kelso. Mr. Kutcher has a lot more talent than folks were giving him credit for.The scenes of the various Coast Guard rescues at sea are well done as are those showing the rescue swimmer training. I'd also commend the performance of Brian Geraghty as another young recruit back for his third try at the Rescue Swimmer School.I guess the best praise I could give The Guardian is that the Coast Guard ought to adopt this film for recruiting.",The Guardian
1,SnoopyStyle,strong start,6,20 June 2016,"Ben Randall (Kevin Costner) is a veteran Coast Guard rescue swimmer. His wife Helen (Sela Ward) is leaving him. He loses his friend during a deadly accident in a rescue. After injuries and possible PTSD, he is forced to be an instructor at the Coast Guard ""A"" school. The new recruits include an arrogant champion swimmer Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher) who is more interested in the swimming records. He meets Emily Thomas (Melissa Sagemiller) at a wedding. Ben is unconvinced of Jake's commitment and then he uncovers his hidden past.This starts with a couple of thrilling rescues. It puts the movie in a compelling spot. Then it turns into a traditional 'An Officer and A Gentleman'. It's a little too on-the-nose especially with Jake's story. I would have preferred a more interesting Jake performance. It also goes on a little too long. This shouldn't be over two hours long. It needs a bit of tightening including the climax. I may even suggest dropping the love interest but this is still Hollywood. It's a movie that starts strong and stays compelling despite its oddly strict-formulaic story.",The Guardian
2,Prismark10,In deep,5,6 February 2017,"There is nothing too much original about The Guardian. It is a tale of veteran coast guard Ben Randall (Kevin Costner) who after a tragic rescue operation and a troubled marriage is assigned to train new recruits at coast guard training school.He meets cocky Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher) a swimming champion who has joined the coast guard training and who starts a casual relationship with another teacher while in training.At first Ben and Jake do not get along but gradually come to respect each other especially as Jake opens up about his past.The film is just too formulaic, you have seen elements of it in films like Top Gun or Backdraft. Director Andrew Davis excels in the coast guard rescue scenes but too much of the film is choppy.",The Guardian
3,kosmasp,Recruiting much,7,22 January 2021,"Anyone who is even a little cynic (although I reckon you could also say ""realist"" in this case), might come to the conclusion this is a public service announcement - a recruiting video of sorts! Well film in this case of course. And you have many arguments on your side that would really point to that and make it a strong case overall.That being said, you can also just sit back, relax and enjoy the excitement of the movie overall. Yes this is filled with cliches, yes this has patriotism and heroism written all over it (with the occasional human flaw of course), but it has Kevin Costner! And if anyone can convey a feeling and screen presence it is him! This is not Waterworld (no matter which cut you prefer or not), this is a solid movie based on a profession that is anything but easy! I know I have as much respect as you can have for any job",The Guardian
4,gavin6942,Not One of Kevin Costner's Better Epics,5,6 August 2007,"Ben Randall (Kevin Costner) is the greatest Coast Guard lifesaver of all time. He holds many records in swimming, life-saving and more. But he also knows how to get too involved with his job and forgets about his wife. After his latest crew dies in a nasty accident, he is reassigned to teach the next batch of recruits -- one of whom (Ashton Kutcher) may well just beat him yet.I like Kevin Costner sometimes (""Waterworld"", ""The Postman"") and he does a fine job here. There are definitely some good moments -- I liked the bar fight scene between the Navy and the Coast Guard. I liked how there was finally a film made about the Coast Guard, which has to be like the only major force never appearing in movies. But some things about this film just got to me.My biggest complaint is the epic nature of this one. Costner is notorious for making epic movies, and I don't generally mind (again, both ""Waterworld"" and ""The Postman"" are worth sitting through multiple times). But here, we have plots that don't really matter and a film that could end two or three times but just keeps going. Epilogue after epilogue is unnecessary. I was getting restless because what could have been a tight picture became a sprawled out mess.I also was uneasy about Ashton Kutcher. Although he did really well in ""Butterfly Effect"", I have a difficult time seeing hi mas a serious actor. And even as a comedian, I find his humor stupid. So his very presence makes me uncomfortable. Now, that's my problem and not his, but it ruined the film for me. And, in all honesty, I just didn't see him as the man for the role. I can't see Kevin Costner having Kutcher as a student.And there were scenes where the camera shots were done in an amateur look, maybe to make it look like a training video or something. I'm not sure what the point was. (This was especially during the swimming class sections.) I didn't find it flowed well, and I would have much rather had a Kenny Loggins montage.On a completely unrelated note: This happens to be one of two recent films with Neal McDonough and Brian Geraghty co-starring. The other is ""I Know Who Killed Me"", which was even worse than this film.So I didn't care for this film. I mean, if they edited it down about a half hour shorter to pick up the pace and remove extraneous scenes, I would not mind at all. That would raise my opinion. But as it sits, I just felt this was too sloppy and not up to Costner's standard of greatness.",The Guardian
5,jboothmillard,The Guardian,5,20 July 2009,"When I first heard about this film from director Andrew Davis (The Fugitive), I automatically thought of the William Friedkin supernatural horror, the title doesn't suggest anything about rescue divers. Basically ageing USCG (United States Coast Guard) rescue swimmer Ben Randall (Kevin Costner) has his whole team die in a failed sea rescue mission, and he is reassigned as a trainer for new recruits. Among the new students is promising, if a little boastful and show-off, Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher), who seems to have the ability to do almost anything to impress, with speed and agility. He manages to beat all records originally held by Ben, and eventually he and the many other students graduate as professional rescue swimmers, and of course towards the end of the film they get to prove themselves. Also starring Melissa Sagemiller as Emily Thomas, Bonnie Bramlett as Maggie McGlone, Clancy Brown as Capt. William Hadley, Sela Ward as Helen Randall, Neal McDonough as Jack Skinner, John Heard as Capt. Frank Larson, Brian Geraghty as Billy Hodge and Shelby Fenner as Cate Lindsey. I'm not sure if I fully agree with the critics that Costner is getting better with age, but he certainly gives a good performance, with Ashton an alright support. Certainly the storm rescues are good viewing, but the film could have been cut down quite a bit, and I don't see it as a guilty pleasure, but it's okay. Kevin Costner was number 93 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Worth watching!",The Guardian
6,rmax304823,The perfect stereotype?,5,30 June 2007,"I wish I knew what to make of a movie like this. It seems to be divided into two parts -- action sequences and personal dramas ashore. It follows Ashton Kutsher through survival swimmer school, guided by Master Chief Kevin Costner, then to Alaska where a couple of spectacular rescues take place, the last resulting in death.I must say that the scenes on the beach struck me as so stereotypical in so many ways that they should be barnacle encrusted. A typical bar room fight between Navy guys and Coast Guardsmen (""puddle pirates""). The experienced old timer Costner who is, as an elderly bar tender tells him, ""married to the Coast Guard."" The older chief who ""keeps trying to prove to himself that he's still nineteen."" The neglected ex wife ashore to whom Kostner pays a farewell visit. The seemingly sadistic demands placed on the swimmers by the instructors, all in pursuit of a loftier goal. The gifted young man hobbled by a troubled past.The problem is that we've seen it all before. If it's Kevin Costner here, it's Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosset Jr. or Vigo Mortenson or Robert DeNiro elsewhere. And the climactic scene has elements drawn shamelessly from ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""Dead Calm."" None of it is fresh and none of the old stereotyped characters and situations are handled with any originality.It works best as a kind of documentary of what goes on in the swimmer's school and what could happen afterward and even that's a little weak because we don't get much in the way of instruction. It's mostly personal conflict, romance, and tension about washing out.It's a shame because the U. S. Coast Guard is rather a noble outfit, its official mission being ""the safety of lives and property at sea."" In war time it is transferred to the Navy Department and serves in combat roles. In World War II, the Coast Guard even managed to have a Medal of Honor winner in its ranks.But, again, we don't learn much about that. We don't really learn much about anything. The film devolves into a succession of visual displays and not too much else. A disappointment.",The Guardian
7,blanche-2,The work of the Coast Guard,7,3 April 2013,"We've seen ""The Guardian"" many times before -- the young turk versus the old, dried up vet. But just because we've seen something done before doesn't mean the same story can't make a good movie.From 2006, The Guardian is the story of Chief Petty Officer Ben Randall (Kevin Costner), a rescue swimmer for the Coast Guard who is still working despite the retirement age of 40. After a horrific rescue situation during which his best friend died, Ben's boss finally gives him a choice - he can teach at a Coast Guard school or retire. He decides to teach. There, he meets a hot shot, Jake Fischer, a top swimmer with scholarship offers from everywhere.There are some absolutely terrifying rescue scenes in this - the power of the ocean is awesome against man - and the scenes take place at night. Scary as all get-out. It really gives one an appreciation for the Coast Guard and the work that they do. This aspect alone makes the film worth it.The dialogue is good, too, and Costner brings a gentle quality to his role. And the point made is good and true: the Coast Guard doesn't get the respect the other military branches get, and they should.The title refers to people drowning claiming to feel a presence helping them survive.You won't forget the rescue scenes. Recommended.",The Guardian
8,edwagreen,The Guardian-Highest Rating for this Film of Valor & Courage****,10,3 July 2007,"Outstanding film dealing with rescue swimmers from the U.S. Coast Guard. Few of us realized how valuable these people are. After seeing this film, you shall certainly appreciate them even more.As Ben Randall, Kevin Costner has about the best part he has had in years. He is tremendous as a no-nonsense instructor to the young men applying for such positions. He is an unconventional teacher. He teaches you about hypothermia by placing you in that kind of situation.As a cocky student, Ashton Kutcher gives a solid performance as the know-it-all who has plenty to learn. Naturally, he hides a dark secret that occurred at age 16.The film shows you what the trainees have to go through. It deals with their personal lives as well as Costner's wife leaves him as he is literally married to his job.While the ending will break your heart, this is a fabulous film dealing with people there to save lives. The film is a taut tribute to these people.",The Guardian
9,michaelRokeefe,Cocky student meets the pro.,6,10 March 2007,"Exhilarating and exciting. Familiar TOP GUN formula action drama about a legendary Rescue Swimmer, Ben Randall(Kevin Costner),temporarily teaching an elite training program of Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers. His first class of raw recruits will afford him a cocky former swimming champ, Jake Fisher(Ashtun Kutcher), who intends to break every record set by Randall and then some. The two will knock heads, before Randall instills Jake with the right reasons for laying his life on the line to save lives. The story is compelling and full of heart pounding spectacular rescues in the frigid waters of the Bering Sea. The cast also features: Sela Ward, Clancy Brown, Melissa Sagemiller and Alex Daniels. Kudos to director Andrew Davis. Costner and Kutcher work very well together. Sagemiller deserved more screen time.",The Guardian
10,jotix100,The US Coast Guard,7,18 June 2008,"This unit of the armed forces has not been featured in the movies as much as the other, more glamorous cousins. Never fear, ""The Guardian"", under Andrew Davis' able direction takes care of putting things right. Working on Ron Brikenhoff's screenplay, Mr. Davis set out to give an account of the men in a special unit that are responsible for daring rescues at sea.The action centers around Ben Randall, a man that has seen action close at hand. He has his shares of triumphs and failures. His love for the job creates havoc on his relationship with his artist wife, Helen, who feels the strain from the separation and dangers her man faces. Ben goes to a training center for people within the Coast Guard that will be prepared for those daring rescues Ben seems to excel on.Enter Jake Fischer, a hopeful trainee, who doesn't seem to make a good impression on Randall. Ben sees in Jake himself as a young man. He knows Jake will be an asset to any unit where he serves. Jake, after graduation is sent to Kodiak, Alaska, as part as the rescue team. He has a good opportunity to show Ben Randall how well he was prepared to face a tough job. Ultimately, Randall and Fischer are joined together in one of the toughest assignments both undertook. One wouldn't think a star of Kevin Costner's stature to ever go into the water again after the debacle of ""Waterworld"", but he shows he has no problems of that kind. His Ben Randall is the stuff heroes are made of. Anton Kutcher, who plays Jake makes an excellent contribution to the film. Both stars show an easy chemistry that helps the overall enjoyment of this film. Melissa Sagemiller is seen as Emily Thomas, Jake's girlfriend. Sela Ward has nothing to play with. Andrew Davis delivers an exciting film for all to enjoy.",The Guardian
11,dbborroughs,Too long for a film you can guess the ending of five minutes in,4,28 December 2008,"This is a film about the Coast Guard rescue teams.I saw the film ages ago and never really got into it. I figured I'd try it again at some later point, but something about the film kept nagging at me, namely why would I give up a another two and a half hours of my life to see a story unfold that you can see coming from the first five minutes? If you can't watch this movie and know what every plot point is going to be and know what the end is then you haven't seen many films.Its not bad but one has to wonder why it takes almost two and a half hours to get where its going when its so clear where that is. Now that I've seen it I don't need to see it again, even though I fleetingly will think I should.",The Guardian
12,lastliberal,22 is the number of people that I've lost. It's the only number that I've kept track of.,6,2 July 2007,"This is a bad remake of An Officer and a Gentleman for the teen set. I knew Richard Gere, and I can assure you that Ashton Kutcher is no Richard Gere.This movie is so clean that the Coast Guard could use it for a recruiting film. There just isn't any life in it - not between Kevin Costner and Kutcher, and not between Kutcher and Melissa Sagemiller. The rest of the characters in the film were just wasted.If you like the Bering Sea action - and who wouldn't - then that is the most exciting thing about this film.The ending was pure crap!",The Guardian
13,zardoz-13,Above-Average Coast Guard Boot Camp Epic,7,5 November 2010,"""Under Siege"" director Andrew Davis pays tribute to the rescue swimmers of the U.S. Coast Guard in ""The Guardian,"" toplining Kevin Costner as a legendary swimmer who trains an aggressive young turk, Ashton Kutcher, after Costner loses his entire crew during a daring high seas rescue attempt that ends in disaster. Ben Randall (Kevin Costner of ""Dances with Wolves"") is given the choice of either leaving the Coast Guard or taking time off to recover by training a new class of rescue swimmers in this bittersweet but heroic tale. When the action starts our hero is estranged from his long-time wife Helen Randall (Sela Ward of ""The Day After Tomorrow"") because they cannot spend enough quality time together. Ben is repeatedly being summoned for one more mission. After he manages to survive the debacle that wipes out his entire crew, including his best friend, Carl Billings (Omari Hardwick of ""Kick Ass""), Ben bows to the stern wishes of his superior officer, Capt. William Hadley (Clancy Brown of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street""), who reassigns him to the Coast Guard's 'A' training training center. For the record, the 'A' School is where recruits learn the ropes of rescue swimming. The training sequences with the swimmers carrying out strenuous underwater exercises in a pool are visually compelling stuff, especially the brick scene at the bottom of the pool. Two men are paired up per brick and they must slide it from the shallow end to the deep end. One of them must always stick with the brick while the other surfaces to replenish his air supply. Davis and his special effects team do a marvelous job of incorporating footage that they lensed in their six-foot wave tank with genuine oceanic footage. None of the actors in the rough seas scenes were in real waters; they were in the tank.Basically, after the opening disaster, ""The Guardian"" turns into just another boot camp movie with the seasoned veteran putting the recruits through the ringer, separating the ones who want to succeed from those who don't have the stuff for success. Of course, Randall's way differs drastically from the teachers at the 'A' School so he winds up ruffling some feathers. He encounters a record-breaking, high school swimmer, Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher of ""The Butterfly Effect""), who wants to become the next Ben Randall. Gradually, the two men grow to understand each other, and Ben converts brash young Jake into a team player. Along the way, Ben learns Jake's dark secret about a car crash that killed Jake's entire swim team and alienated him from his hometown friends. Ben helps Jack out and Jake graduates at the top of his class. Despite all the grueling rigors that Ben put Jake through in the water, Jake finds time to romance a local elementary school teacher, Emily Thomas (Melissa Sagemiller of ""The Clearing""), who demands that they keep everything casual because she knows that he is only temporary. She informs him early on in that his kind rotates through every 18 weeks. The problem with ""The Guardian"" is that Jake and Emily's romance develops less passion than the boot camp scenes. One subplot about a three-time repeat swimmer, Billy Hodge (Brian Geraghty of ""The Hurt Locker""), who struggles to learn how to keep a tough swim instructor, Jack Skinner (Neal McDonough of ""Walking Tall""), from drowning him in a simulated drowning exercise is good. Jake inspires Hodge's confidence after they bond during a brawl at a Navy bar. Not long afterward, Ben takes Jake back to the Navy bar and slams the pugnacious Navy squib face down into the bar. Davis and ""D-Tox"" scenarist Ron L. Brinkerhoff flesh out Costner's character so he can behave in a different light as he tempers his approach to Jake and Billy based on their identity. Costner gives one of his better performances because he plays a character of considerable nuance. Bonnie Bramlett of ""Vanishing Point"" is a revelation as bar owner Maggie McGlone who serves beer and sympathy in her saloon.The ending is tragic, but it wasn't the only ending that Davis filmed. Actually, nobody from the head of Disney to Costner himself liked the other ending, but Davis shot it anyway for protection. Amazingly enough, the focus group must have preferred the most dire ending. In the alternate ending, our crusty hero survives. Mind you, ""The Guardian"" is an above-average adventure, but it isn't top drawer entertainment. The rescues look convincing enough in the savage seas that swamp our heroes.",The Guardian
14,ferguson-6,It's Getting Pretty Deep in Here,6,1 October 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. Watching ""The Guardian"" is like reading the latest John Grisham novel. You know what's going to happen and even how it's going to happen, but you just can't stop yourself. Think of this as a blended version of ""GI Jane"", ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", ""Top Gun"", ""The Perfect Storm"" and a bit of ""Bull Durham"".It is nice to see Kevin Costner transitioning well into the middle-aged roles. His last two films even have him in a relationship with women around his age (Joan Allen and now Sela Ward). I still have difficulty watching his sulking, smirking, strutting same old stuff, but hats off for no longer pretending to be 35 years old. Ashton Kutcher, on the other hand, seems perfect in the cocky young buck role - every bit as good as Cruise was in ""Top Gun"" (which really isn't saying much). The supporting cast is decent with Clancy Brown (terrific as the prison guard in the great ""Shawshank Redemption""), John Heard and relative newcomer Melissa Sagemiller (Kutcher's love interest).For director Andrew Davis (""The Fugitive"" and the underrated ""A Perfect Murder"") the saving grace for this film is not the acting, but the action sequences and the Coast Guard training scenes. Watching the swimmers endure in-the-water torture is very uncomfortable but effective. The best scenes are the real rescue scenes as the wave pool looks pretty real most of the time.Yes, it is very predictable and yes we have seen most of it before, but it is entertaining and interesting enough to keep you munching popcorn for a couple of hours. Just close your eyes during the mushy parts!",The Guardian
15,gradyharp,The Star is the Sea,7,24 January 2007,"Some of the most compelling moments in this otherwise dated rehash of the troubled aging chance-taker in a military unit taking on the similar inner demons of a young recruit are the frames that depict the raging sea in middle of storms. The photography and superimposed action shots of rescues in the midst of nature's havoc are stunning to watch.The movie itself is well made by director Andrew Davis (Collateral Damage, The Fugitive, Under Siege, etc) and the actors selected to portray the one-dimensional roles as written by Ron L. Brinkerhoff carry the movie along. The problem, if it is one for the viewer, is that this story has been told so many times for every branch of the service industries (Navy, Marines, Army, Firefighters, Policemen) and now adds the US Coast Guard to the mix. The synopsis in a capsule is old tortured USCG rescue swimmer (Kevin Kostner) is a dedicated man who puts his job before his wife (Sela Ward) and loses his rescue swimmer's team in a disaster, placing him in nightmare torn state that the USCG recognizes and sends him off to be an instructor for the USCG where he encounters a brilliant young athlete recruit (Ashton Kutcher) with his own similar demons and the two work things out to the betterment of both.It is not a bad story, just a tired one. But as a movie it carries fairly well thanks to the scenes with the Sea - beautifully captured by cinematographer Stephen St. John with a lot of help from special effects chief Scott Fisher and visual effects chief Erika Abrams. Costner and Kutcher manage their assignments well as does the rest of the crew. This is a good diversionary movie - just no surprises to make it unique. Grady Harp",The Guardian
16,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Guardian,8,15 October 2006,"There are many, many films out there about various uniformed folk. The police and fire department probably get represented a fair bit in movies, ranging from heroic stories, to tragedies, and some even featuring them in bad light. In my opinion, first movies should always be sort of a tribute story to the boys and girls in uniform, before adding some flavour in subsequent films with more sophisticated stories that can even venture into putting some characters in negative light. Think Backdraft, where you have the good and the bad apples from the fire department. Though on the other hand, first movies can also be hampered by this approach to the storyline, for its emphasis on the introduction of the profession's job scope, in keeping things stuck to a formula, and by having characters no less than heroic.The Guardian, taking on the formulaic approach as a first film featuring the US Coast Guard in recent times, definitely comes with a tinge of familiarity in storyline. The Japanese has already had their tribute to their equivalent of the uniformed group in the Umizaru series (its second movie being shown here as well), and if you combine that with Hollywood's Top Gun (itself a heroic tribute movie of sorts to the US Navy Pilots), you have this movie. In fact, the beginning and end structure is almost similar, with Kodiak, Alaska bookending the movie like what the Indian Ocean did for Top Gun, and both scenes being actual on-the-job action sequences. Having most of its scenes in a training school, and recognizable Top-Gun-ish moments, may make some wince of deja vu, but as I already mentioned, it's formula.This movie's focus is on the US Coast Guard, in particular, a select group of highly trained men and women who are the Rescue Swimmers, the folks who actually take the dive from the choppers into the ocean, to approach ships in distress to coordinate the rescue missions. It's a daily risk to their lives, but their mission, their calling, is in putting the lives of others ahead of theirs. Naturally, being the best amongst the best, does make one appear to be cocky. Ben Randall (Kevin Costner) is a highly decorated and dedicated rescue swimmer, having set records and being the stuff of legends with his rescue exploits. However, records are nothing, and the job is not to break records but is actually towards the noble cause of saving lives. This, is what rookie Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher) has to learn, if he is to survive the course, now being taught by Randall.Naturally, the saying of one mountain's inability to house two tigers ring true, as both men, for personal reasons, rub each other the wrong way. The stern instructor versus the proud rookie, with the former having to see a lot of qualities in the latter, with the potential to exceed his expectations, if nurtured the right way. Randall's unorthodox training methods also raises eyebrows, but to his detractors, his methods are to bridge classroom theories and safe practical sessions, with the real thing. Having to learn from the best in the business always is difficult, and underscores the differences in personalities between Randall and Fischer, one already the best, the other wanting to be, and beat the best. However, both men soon find out that they have a lot more in common, in their seeking of redemption.The movie's well paced, with action, romance, noisy training sessions and quiet moments achieving a rare balance of screen time. Again sticking to formula, having relationships that don't really work out, are hallmarks of partners who cannot endure their partner's long absence given the innate preference to answer the never-ending call of duty. Sela Ward and Melissa Sagemiller play the romantic interests Helen Randall and Emily Thomas, adding some female presence to a movie full of testosterone set in water. The soundtrack is also top notch, with Bryan Adams, yet again contributing a song - Never Let Go, to a Costner movie.I've been a Kevin Costner fan since young, having first watched him in the cowboy movie Silverado. I sat through 3 of his three hour long movies in the theatres - his multi-award winning Dances With Wolves, Oliver Stone's JFK, and Lawrence Kasdan's Wyatt Earp. I've enjoyed his action movies like Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and even the classic The Untouchables. This movie will mark his attempt to return as a leading man, given softer appearances in Rumor Has It and The Upside of Anger. Ashton Kutcher might be better known for his mad antics in the television series Punk'd, but here, he ditches madcap humour for some serious drama as a Ray-Ban Cruise clone, the record breaking rookie from high school. My first Kutcher movie happened to be The Butterfly Effect, and I thought he brought some of the edginess from that role over here.Despite being a formula movie, I'd recommend it for being one of those rare heroic movies that come out from Hollywood, paying tribute to the uniformed group it's based on. Stay tuned during the end credits for some breathtakingly beautiful scenic helicopter fly-by scenes and historical photographs of the advent of the US Coast Guard, played along to songs from the soundtrack. ""Run Me In The Dirt"" is fast becoming one of my favourite tunes.""So Others May Live""",The Guardian
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,"No, thank you",3,8 February 2007,"My friend and I really did want to see The Guardian when it was released in the theater, but we never got the chance or had the money when we had the opportunity. I just rented it and we watched it together last night and I fell asleep 3 times! I thought maybe it was just me, but even my friend said that she thought it was a little dull. Then we asked our other friend what he thought and he just sighed and said that he was with me on the sleeping. The story was just so dull and predictable, Ashton and Kevin, I'm so sorry to say this, but they're not strong enough leading men to keep a story moving.So as you can figure pretty much from the trailer, Kevin is traumatized from a rescue mission that was fatal to his team and victims, Ashton comes into the camp to train to be a rescuer, but he's a punk without a cause, until he and Kevin discover how much they have in common. But Kevin sticks with Ashton and pulls him through the camp, watch An Officer and a Gentlemen for the sub plot, and of course Ashton makes it through camp and becomes a rescuer, but the task becomes more difficult when Kevin can't face his inner demons.The story is so incredibly predictable, like I said just watch An Officer and a Gentleman, that's the plot over all. Kevin's character I just felt wasn't that sympathetic, I don't know if it was just the writing or the way it was presented, but I just wouldn't recommend this movie, it was too long and too predictable. Why this movie has a decent rating? I'm still not sure, but believe me, you'll fall asleep a few times trying to get through this movie.3/10",The Guardian
18,disdressed12,"a harrowing,authentic movie about the heroes of the U.S Coast Guard(the rescue swimmers)",9,25 January 2007,"i really enjoyed this movie.for one thing,we actually have a movie about real heroes,who are not cocky and arrogant,but do their jobs with little recognition.the heroes i'm talking about are the men and woman of the coast guard, specifically the rescue swimmers.in most cases,they do not know the people they are saving,and many times they they will never know their names.this film focuses on the U.S Coastguard,and stars Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher as the main characters.Costner plays Ben Randall,a legendary rescue swimmer,who,due to a tragedy during his last mission,find himself as the instructor of the Coast Guard's ""A"" school, where th best of the best are trained.Kutcher plays Jake Fischer,a cocky young,high school swim champion,whose only reason for being there is to beat all the records,most of then held by Randall.from here on,the movie follows the predictable Hollywood formula for this genre.however,it is better than many movie of its type.one reason for that is the realism in the rescue scenes.there are some really harrowing,thrilling moments.the dramatic scenes are also well done.Kevin Costner is very convincing in his role.however,Kutcher really impresses,with his maturity,and dare i say it, depth.he is definitely evolving as a serious actor.Sela Ward has the thankless role as Randall'e neglected wife.her screen time is limited and i got the impression she was sort of coasting along with her character.but to be fair,she isn't really given the screen time needed to bring more depth to the character.that is the nature of role,which is why it is thankless.Andrew Davis(under Siege,The Fugitive)directed the Guardian,and did a brilliant job bringing the script by Ron.L Brinkerhoff to life.finally,i should mention the Coast Guard motto:""So Others May Live"".that tells you how selfless these men and women are,putting their lives on the line for people they don't know.it's nice to see them get some recognition,and maybe the movie will inspire people to join the Coast Guard.anyway,although this movie would not be called a masterpiece(it isn't that kind of move)it is an excellent film in its own right.I give ""The Guardian"" a strong 9/10",The Guardian
19,Robert_duder,Disappointingly cliché'd with no surprises,7,22 January 2007,"First of all I still love Kevin Costner, hands down one of my favorite Hollywood actors even during his less than stellar career downs he's had lately and I had high hopes for The Guardian teaming him with hot young and up and comer Ashton Kutcher and for all intensive purposes it was a great match. The story even had loads of promise and I kept praying silently to myself that the film would not go in the way that you knew it would from square one but disappointedly the film falls right into that rut and leads you into a no surprise zone where everything happens exactly the way you'd expect and the characters are exactly what you would expect and although sometimes a tried and true genre of film can be a good thing it simply destroys what could have been great about The Guardian. I mean the film is entertaining enough and the strong cast, both leading and supporting are excellent but the story is the same thing and you could watch five minutes and literally lay the rest out word for word as to what would happen.Kevin Costner is still a great star and an awesome screen presence. He is beginning to be one of those ""older"" actors who brings class and style and maturity to a film. However he has of late been falling into this path of playing the same role again and again. Serious, no holds barred, passionate about something, holier than thou who is inevitably going to sacrifice himself for the greater good...see Message In A Bottle, Open Range, The Postman and so on. That being said Costner's performance as the legendary Coast Guard swimmer is good and you do care about his character and what happens to him. But since the minute he walked on screen I knew he would die in some tragic yet heroic way and more than anything else I prayed that it wouldn't go that way but it did. Ashton Kutcher really gets the shining role as conceited, loud mouth newcomer to the ""A"" School, Jake Fischer. Kutcher continues to impress in more serious roles and this is no exception. He plays off Costner like a pro and the two of them make a viable team and adversaries to a certain degree. The old fish vs the new fish. Kutcher should continue to take these roles because this film is saved by his talent in part. The supporting cast is made up of some excellent character actors including the superb Clancy Brown in a very small role but nonetheless a welcomed addition, Sela Ward as Costner's estranged wife, and John Heard playing the Captain of the ""A"" School. The supporting cast no matter how small is important and do a great job.Director Andrew Davis is no newcomer and in essence the way the story moves, it's pace and it's setting and the way the characters unravel show a great experience behind the camera and Davis is indeed that. He's directed some incredible films including The Fugitive, Collateral Damage and Under Siege, he is an action film expert but perhaps that worked against him in a more serious realistic film like this. Regardless Davis did a great job, the cast were all strong and in tact but the story is what blew this one. It was almost mundane, predictable and annoying because nothing out of the box ever happens. In some ways it does indeed come across as more of an advertisement for the Coast Guard than anything. It's not ""not"" entertaining, it's a decent film that could have been incredible. The lack of vision pains me but still well worth seeing for an evening of entertainment. 7/10",The Guardian
20,MLDinTN,story that works plus good special effects,8,1 July 2007,"I liked this movie. I guess it didn't do that well at the box office because people felt it was a rip off of An Officer and A Gentlemen. And I agree that it was. But I liked AOAAG, so I liked this movie.Kevin Costner plays one of his better roles as of late. And Ashton Kutcher is actually good in this drama. Plus, he is very hot in this with the clean shaven short hair look.Also, I thought the special effects during the rescue scenes were very good. It looked realistic and gave the movie some suspense. The ending was very sad. I would have liked it to turn out different.FINAL VERDICT: Even though this is a long movie, I didn't notice too much because I thought it was entertaining. It should have gotten better reviews when it was in theaters. Check it out when you can.",The Guardian
21,inkblot11,"Laudatory look at the brave men and women of the Coast Guard, a worthy film",7,24 November 2006,"Ben (Kevin Costner) has been rescuing those in peril on the sea for quite a long time. As a Coast Guard swimmer, it has been his job to locate the people in the water and carry them to the end of the ladders dropped down from the rescue helicopters. He is so immersed in his job, pun intended, that he has sacrificed his personal life. His wife is filing for divorce. When a rescue attempt results in the death of a close friend at his side, Ben is sent south from Kodiak to Seattle. He is to help train a new class of Guardsmen who wish to be rescue swimmers. There, Ben meets Jake (Asthon Kutcher). Jake is a medal winning swimmer whose ability is only exceeded by his swagger. Does Jake truly have what it takes to be a hero on the water? And, is a Jake a player when it comes to the pretty teacher he meets in Seattle? This is a fine movie, but not extraordinary. The best parts are the on-the-water missions which prove to the viewer that this is no job for the meek at heart. Nevertheless, Costner is good as the stubborn, aging swimmer who can't resist one more chance to save lives. Kutcher is also laudatory for his role as the brash swimmer whose bravado is genuine but who has a soft core off the water. The other actors are quite nice, too. The action scenes should please those fans who like it dangerous and the smaller love story will make time with another set of fans. All in all, this is a good choice for a Saturday night, curl-up-in-the-couch film viewing. Add on a blanket for those scenes taking place in the icy waters.",The Guardian

This predictable but interesting mainstream movie has Kevin Costner in is usual environment, playing the usual flawed though this time heroic Coast Guard savior. The stereotypical melodrama never quite appears on the screen fortunately and Ashton Kutcher gets a great come-back scene that hits a new level of mainstream quality for defying the ordinary, boring dramas of previous movies. The cinematography started well but didn't continue throughout the movie in its raw, daring, naturalistic form. Overall, this is a good, decent, improved version of action, thriller drama that we've seen before but better. Seven out of Ten Stars.",The Guardian
23,slightlymad22,"Nothing New, But Very Entertaining",8,9 October 2016,"Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in his filmography in order, I come to 2006's The Guardian Plot In A Paragraph: Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher) a high school swim champion, enrolls in the U.S. Coast Guard's ""A"" School, where legendary rescue swimmer Ben Randall (KC) teaches him some hard lessons as he believes he is there for the wrong reasons.There is absolutely nothing new here, we've seen everything before. Mainly in An Officer & A Gentleman, The Guardian is as cliché as it gets. But I for one find it an enjoyable movie.Almost every cliché is ticked along the way, (I think the only one they missed is Kutchers love interest not being KC's daughter) but that doesn't meant it isn't good. Both leads put in good performances and are well backed up by Neal McDonough, Clancy Brown, Brian Geraghty and John Heard.As for the characters, KC is grumpy, Kutcher is arrogant, Geraghty is suitably shy and nervous, but it's McDonough who I believe is what an instructor would be like in a place like this.Slated upon release, I can't recall reading one positive review, but I enjoyed it then, and I still do now, it's one both of my kids like too. It's one of the movies that if the kids walk in a room and I'm watching it, they will sit with me and watch the rest of it.",The Guardian
24,Rodrigo_Amaro,Heroic clichéd flick,4,20 August 2010,"This film follows the journey of learning of future rescue divers of the U.S. Coast Guard. This film follows Kevin Costner playing the tough chief who is going to act tough against Ashton Kutcher and a bunch of other guys who want to be part of a great team: the team who rescue people but are underpaid. This film follows the same path of ""Top Gun"", ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" and ""Annapolis"". What this film doesn't follow is the quality of these other films. It is good in some moments but in another is just a boring movie where most of the time it drags you in trying to sound convincing and appealing. Sadly this is my first disappointment on watching a film directed by Andrew Davis (master and commander of precious films like ""The Fugitive"" and the really good Steven Seagal's films ""Under Siege"" and ""Above the Law""). But I must say that the problem wasn't his direction, but I think the screenplay was too clichéd and annoying. The training scenes followed the obvious but it was good; the mission scenes on the ocean were tiresome and bad made (in some scenes you could notice an ocean made of CGI effects). It even made Kutcher cry (one of the funniest scenes if wasn't for the fact why he's crying). As far for his acting is kind of embarrassing seeing these guy (AGAIN!) playing the most successful guy in his job, the most successful with the ladies (AGAIN!), having nothing against him just because Costner's character trusts this man to the point of forgiving every single mistake he makes. C'mon!No offense intended to the people who work saving people but if you liked this movie then you have a serious problem with what you're watching or don't know what movies really is. And I'm tired of watching films so filled with heroism and bravery whose major speech is to say: ""Only those who RESCUE people are heroes"". So the man and women who wake up early every day to go to their jobs, barely getting paid enough and still have a smile on the face, without receiving a thank you for their services can't be called a hero? Robert De Niro's talk with Francis Capra in ""A Bronx Tale"" about who the real though guy is illustrates better my point of view. And that was a helluva of movie. The only good thing about ""The Guardian"" is the presence of Kevin Costner who gave a fine performance here, very surprising (if you consider that the 2000's wasn't a good decade for him). But once again he made the exactly same thing his character did in the awful ""Message in a Bottle"": Played the hero on a storm and went to meet the Creator on the water. It was a decent acting for him but a weak performance for Kutcher, so you have a seesaw between these two lead actors here. The good supporting cast includes Sela Ward, Neal McDonough, Dulé Hill and Brian Geraghty.If you like cliché after cliché this movie is for you. If you have a brain and enjoy heroes saving people skip this one and try to watch ""Backdraft"" (I know, it's about firefighters but it's way better than this). 4/10",The Guardian

There he learns a lot about his future job but also himself as a person with the help of his instructor who has a lot to teach him about life in general.I liked this movie because it had a simple but interesting plot combined with some action scenes that made it even better. The interpretations of both Kevin Costner who played as Ben Randall and Ashton Kutcher who played as Jake Fischer were very good and the combination of a young troubled man with an experienced one trying to help him, it worked very well. The direction which was made by Andrew Davis it was good but I expected from him to also present with a different way the backstories of his main characters.

26,Floated2,Pretty good and interesting story of the Coast Guard,7,20 October 2010,"The Guardian tells a good story about the training and work ethic of being in the Coastguard army.

Against his wishes, he is forced to be an instructor for a class of future rescue swimmers. One of these swimmers happens to be played by Ashton Kutcher. He thinks he is better than everyone else and that he can beat all the swimming records. Costner notices this and takes it as a challenge to make Kutcher the best possible rescue swimmer there is. Obviously, as you deal with these kinds of stories, you are going to run into a lot of clichés, and are meant to be intrigued and entertained with the story.Overall, the movie is relatively decent. It is extremely predictable (except the ending) and clichéd, but it is a good-time. There is action, romance and comedy. The chemistry between Kutcher and Costner was really good. The ending was somewhat surprising but not bad, I liked how Ashton did the voice over, that was pretty neat and clever.",The Guardian

If you are an avid movie fan, the answer is most assuredly, . . Yes! The story of the Navy, courage and heroism is often repeated. I could remind you of the original movie, of which this is a remake, but then, you'd have to compare Spencer Tracy to Kevin Costner and that is not necessary. Over the years, we see how our favorites age through the passing years. Thus it is with men like Kevin Costner who plays Ben Randall, an experienced, senior Chief who has a myriad of dark images in his heart and mind, some of which haunt him as he assumes the title of Instructor at a U.S. Coast Guard school for ""Swimmers."". Among his dozen new recruits is Ashton Kutcher who appears to have matured from ""The 70's Show"" to play Jake Fischer, a hot-shot swimming champion trying to outrun his nightmares and to reprove himself. Then there's Mr. Clancy Brown who surprisingly is commendable as Capt. William Hadley. Last time we saw him, he was at Shawshank Prison. The three men are part of the surprising story of the United States Coast Guard. Through flash back stories and evolving situations, we observe the changing of the guard from one generation to another.

29,mattkratz,outstanding,9,8 August 2014,"This was a terrific movie and one of my favorite Kevin Costner movies. In a nutshell, it is about training for life in the U.S. Coast Guard. Costner plays a Coast Guard legend, who, after a tragic and traumatic accident at sea, gets assigned to teaching and takes hotshot recruit Ashton Kutcher, who had been a swim champion (and who has a similar incident in his past) under his wing as his protégée. The bulk of the movie deals with the classes, swimming, rescue scenes, and the recruits' going out at night. I thought those scenes were hilarious, especially when Kutcher tries to pick up chicks.I think the best parts of this well-done film were the rescue scenes (which were brilliantly filmed), the character development, the classroom scenes in the pool, and the interactions with Costner and Kutcher. I also loved the legend of ""The Guardian. Anyone who loves the stars will love this movie.*** out of ****",The Guardian

31,myriamlenys,decent but undermined by cliché,7,4 August 2019,"""The Guardian"" is an action movie about the American Coast Guard. It is notable for a number of spectacular stunts and set-pieces. It also pays proper tribute to the immense courage of those performing the rescue work. However, it is constantly marred by cliché, to the point where the end credits might just as well have contained the statement that ""No brain cells were stressed during the making of this movie"". Moreover, the characterizations are shallow and one-note.As to the events shown, I can only hope that a certain artistic licence was used when depicting the actual training school for recruits. In the movie, people spend much of their time shouting or barking orders, even in the most inoffensive of contexts. None of this makes sense. Why start cranking up the decibel level the moment a bus arrives ? Simply say : ""You have reached your destination. Please leave the bus in a quick and orderly fashion"". And as for those too lazy, unruly or disorganized to follow this simple instruction - well, they've pretty much disqualified themselves from training for a difficult and demanding profession...This over-emphasis on discipline, order, obedience results in some richly comical moments, such as the scene where one of the recruits spends the night with a lovely young woman. Oversleeping, he does not show up on time in the training school where he should be participating in an exercice. In the training school, his teachers stare at his empty space with a combination of anger, incomprehension and despair : it feels as though they caught the recruit trying to smuggle a nuclear weapon. Presumably this is the first person since the foundation of the United States of America who overslept.Viewers interested in ""contrast and compare"" might want to take a look at a Belgian movie called ""Windkracht 10 : Koksijde rescue"". It's an action movie about the Belgian Coast Guard. The movie shows almost the same assets and weaknesses as ""The Guardian"".",The Guardian

He brings absolutely no depth to his role. Exciting beginning and finale, and mostly boring in between, including the mandatory barroom brawl. Most of the film is taken up with training sequences. At times, this looks like a recruiting film for the Coast Guard. This did not do well at the box office, and I wonder how much of that might have to do with its nondescript title.

The US Coast Guard sponsored no doubt this work but they showed their base and many other interesting details surprising me during all the running time. The soundtrack, the scenery and the cinematography were great too. Kevin Costner made another respectable job after I saw him last time in DRAGONFLY and I think he did here his best performance of his career. Asthon Kutcher was also good as in THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT.

Is forced to go and teach new rescue swimmers up and coming. Butts heads with an arrogant, extremely talented young man played this time around by Kutcher. They argue, they bond and there is one huge mission at the end. It's kinda like G.I. Jane but not as intense or as good. So what does The Guardian bring to the table. Well it is directed by Andrew Davis who has been a success as many times as he's faltered from The Fugitive to Chain Reaction. See my point. So what does it have. Well it's competently directed and well made. It has somewhat believable effects and striking cinematography. But this is a Hollywood movie. All of the performances are pretty good with a surprisingly confident if still a little immature one by Kutcher. The film aims for tears but lacks passion in its conviction. Unlike the recent Annapolis it holds back and is a bit on the long side. The stories in the film are involving but not very memorable and the film is entertaining but not fantastic. It's definitely a step up for Costner from his recent work and a step for Kutcher in the right direction as a leading man. He grows into his character a bit as the film progresses and as far as the way he looks. He's filled out a bit and isn't as scrawny anymore. He sports tight abs, bulging biceps and heaving pecs all too go along with his tears. It may seem that I have spent an entire review bashing this film. But it's not true, although i wasn't extremely impressed with it. It was a solid good movie and solid good entertainment. Not a bad flick as we wait for something great.

The plot closely resembles past flicks like AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN and TOP GUN and even Clint Eastwood's HEARTBREAK RIDGE. It also is too long, and will lose some viewers before the end, which is loosely based on a real rescue. Costner at least plays his age, much as he did in TIN CUP, and looks reasonably grizzled throughout. Sela Ward plays his ex-wife.

Kevin Costner acts with a strong charisma and Ashton Kutcher is also suitable for the part; it's one of the first films showing how life is and how things work in the US Coast Guard, portraying men pushing themselves to the limit only to save other men.

Costner fits nicely in role of legendary Coast Guard rescuer who finally hits the wall, and Kutcher equally well in role of brash swimming phenom being trained by Costner. Kutcher's love interest Sagemiller also meets the specs nicely. These gruff but heart-of-gold old pro vs. cocky newcomer things have a certain formula to follow, this one didn't deviate too much but it works to the end without being too over-the-top. Costner has found sort of a second career in the washed up with one last hurrah slot (see this and For Love of the Game, probably more I haven't seen), I've never been much of a Costner guy but it's a nice schtick for him. I think Kutcher has as much potential as any young actor out there, he's great in a limited range in this and was spectacular in the bizarre Butterfly Effect, he's certainly growing on me.",The Guardian
39,napierslogs,A pretty good action/drama with the Coast Guard on display,7,26 June 2010,"""The Guardian"" stars Ashton Kutcher as a top swimmer training for the Coast Guard and Kevin Costner as an experienced, veteran rescue swimmer as the trainer. Costner and Kutcher are great together; it's the type of role you expect to see Costner in, and the type of role you want to see Kutcher in.I loved seeing the Coast Guard on display and although I don't know exactly what it's like, this film is probably a little dramatized but realistic enough to accept it. It's a cross between an action and a drama. The many action scenes are mixed in with dramatic character development scenes. Since it's a blend of the two, you will need to like both your standard action and standard drama movies. You will also need to like the standard characters that these types of movies have, although they are good characters, there are no surprises.My main complaint is that it's too long. It attempts to bring in too many characters, and they don't all work. They probably also spend a bit too long on some of the action sequences (unless of course you love the action). The length is especially highlighted when watching it on TV, the 3 and a half hours of action/drama is a bit much even for the biggest fans.All in all, ""The Guardian"" is a pretty good movie, standard characters, and no divergence from the expected path, but its done well. I especially recommend it for young swimmers - the Coast Guard could be a very rewarding career, and I wish I had seen this movie when I was younger.",The Guardian
40,gregsrants,"Not bad, but brings nothing new to the table",6,1 October 2006,"Kevin Costner is on a little bit of a roll. Not a roll that is picking up tremendous momentum, but the same actor that would follow up Dances with Wolves with Robin Hood and JFK with The Bodyguard has now put a string of three consecutive films where he has been the best thing on the screen for 90+ minutes. Open Range, The Upside of Anger and Rumor Has It, were all so-so films at best, but Costner shows off his range by acting as the shy cowboy, an alcoholic ex-ballplayer and a millionaire playboy. All three roles were wildly different from the last (hope you are listening Harrison Ford) and all three had a charisma seeping out of their veteran lead like radioactive waste out of a paper barrel.So with a small streak on the line, Costner is back on our 50 foot screens with the new Coast Guard themed film, The Guardian.The Guardian is a simple film that probably tries to do too much. Costner stars as Ben Randall, a Coast Guard rescuer that is the best in the business. He holds all the Academy records and has saved more people than Billy Graham.But what's a movie without back-story conflict and Ben gets his from a botched rescue attempt that leaves his best friend, his Coast Guard team and few civilians the other side of living. The experiences on that fateful day leave Ben with memories and nightmares that lead him from the field to the classroom where he reluctantly agrees to train the next generation of lifesaving helicopter jumpers.Luckily for all the teenage females that sat beside, behind and in front of me in the local theatre, heading up the class is none other than Kelso, opps, sorry, Ashton Kutcher as Jake Fischer. Jake is a cocky sort who holds many swimming records in his small town and he sets out to impress Ben with his speed and comfort level among the world of the fishes.After all the introductions are in order, the movie swells into An Officer and a Gentleman formula where the recruits, train, vomit, hurt, ache, train some more, all while Ben takes a notion towards Jake and continues to push him where others are given slack in an effort of molding him into something of his own image.Then of course, there is the girl. Jake keeps with the genres routine by falling in love with local girl Emily (Melissa Sagemiller) and his attempts at wooing lead to an unlikely but overall expected romance that in turn causes some problems in time management back at the Academy. So, they train, vomit, hurt, ache and train some more.Then just when the movie looks like it is about to conclude and that the best parts of the film's trailer would only be found on the deleted scenes version of the DVD, the movie springs into action after graduation and both Jake and Ben return to Kodiak, Alaska to do what they do best  save lives.By the time the movie ends, you are exhausted. Not from emotion or sitting on the edge of your seat, but from having to change gears so many times in a shopping 136 minute running time. It's first an action movie, then it is a drama, then it is a soapy-drama and romance, then it is a stand-up-and-cheerer, and then we revert back to an action film with an ending that leaves you utterly drained.In all, this doesn't make the movie a non-recommendation. But director Andrew Davis (The Fugitive, Chain Reaction), has enough of a resume now, that he should have known when to stop. And by stop, I mean stop with the endless training of the recruits that seems to go on and on that even I used my indigo watch to see if my own hands were being pruned by all the pool scenes.Cutting these repetitive chapters by half would have given him a tight, thrilling, interesting character study that would lead to at least one half star more from every critic that suffered through the belabored running time.The Guardian therefore is just a mild recommendation. It is exactly what the trailer promises and exactly what you would expect when you buy the ticket. Costner keeps his streak alive (barely) by not embarrassing himself and Kutcher shows that maybe he can act (I said, 'maybe').So there you have it.

41,K3nzit,A two hour long commercial for the U.S. Coast Guard,1,28 December 2019,A two hour long commercial for the U.S. Coast Guard with sloppy visual effects. 'The Guardian' has no depth or originality what so ever!,The Guardian
42,oneloveall,"Drama battles mediocrity, wins.",6,19 January 2007,"Heroic and heartwarming, this Coast Guard rescue drama still suffers heavily from it's somewhat cornball script guiding a numbing predictability for seasoned film fans. Buried in it's niche action of ocean rescuing however, the formulaic nature often takes a back seat to what this movie offers best- an entertaining, often insightful and realistically rendered depiction of this elite underwater training routine, no doubt guided by on-site experts, given the films surprising attention to detail. What makes all of these entertaining, but ultimately shallow training and rescuing scenes stick is the underlying, though sometimes forced, moral conviction that attempts to define this selfless, instant, and all-consuming allegiance that rescue workers pledge to a faceless human race when they are in the grips of danger and the exhaustive repercussions that come with it. In this attempt, The Guardian is noble of it's pursuit, offering continual inspiration, even if it is the kind of inspiration a true cynic would be completely blind to. All those that can still pick choice moments of inherent truth beneath all the cheese however may find enough thematic soul food to munch on throughout the proudly compassionate movie. Unfortunately, any crest this wave was riding found great recession in the end- the film ends up drowning itself out with a bloated climax that takes every theme that was punctuated in a semi-classy manner throughout the movie's already long run time and extended to an irritating and unnecessary degree. The worn out, has-been stylings of one Kevin Costner have again managed to explore an on-screen character with the same tired ""been there, done that"" attitude he has defined his downhill battle with Hollywood. Expectedly, he wears the role well, flashing experience and believability with the bat of an eye, but that same gruff experience Costner seems to thrive off of so well in all his recent work proves to be the same problem viewers will have not seeing this character as just another ornery Costner donning a wetsuit. In contrast, Aston Kutcher seems hungry to prove that he his more then a pretty face with a goofy voice, an image he has not done much to shy away from. There are moments where you simply cannot shake the self-conscious goofiness that subtly effect his performance, but by and large Kutcher has removed the joker veneer for more of an everyman act which by the end will have created a character with some resemblance of a lasting integrity. Nothing is new here, but there may be enough new tricks on this old horse that will give people enough to come out with something worthwhile.",The Guardian
43,bopdog,"A bit clichéd, true, but VERY good and entertaining as well! Costner is a true star",8,16 October 2006,"'The Guardian' contains virtually every cliché of the mentor-cum-buddy movie genre. But it is also extremely likable. Kevin Costner has proved that he is, indeed a true movie star and a great artist. Note that he had a bit of a 'down cycle', first with the too-quirky and self-indulgent 'Water World,' then things got even worse with the even more self-indulgent 'The Postman'. Although I personally think 'The Postman' was pretty good, and it had truly amazing potential, those two movies made people wonder if his directorial triumph and Oscar for 'Dancing With Wolves' was a one-off fluke. 'Kay... enough of the past. just sum it up by mentioning Costner's last few projects: 'Open Range', 'Rumour Has It', and now 'The Guardian'.Each of those, and this one, are truly great movies. This one is entertaining, exciting, and a fulfilling use of my time AND my five quid. Kevin Costner is getting better and better with age. And the kid, Ashton Kutcher, is beginning to look like a real actor. Let's just hope, for his sake, that he eschews the Brad Pitt, Ben Affleck red-carpet, paparazzi-chasing, phony celeb Hollywood track, and instead focuses on his acting as an honest (and demanding) artistic profession. Time will tell.You cannot watch 'The Guardian' without thinking ( a LOT!) about previous movies, such as 'An Officer and a Gentleman'. And even the Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr. movie--- 'Men of Honor'. It's the plot where the older champion/hero begins to feel his age. The younger hotshot/firebrand comes in with his wild testosterone, to set new records, or just upset the elders' applecart.Anyway--- kind of a cliché, and the physical training sequences will remind you of others' work before. I even thought a bit of the Demi Moore movie 'GI Jane' (the mild irony being that Moore is Kutcher's current squeeze). It's all been done before. But the plot elements are repeated so often, in part, because they are so darn good! Those are compelling dynamics to consider in a movie. AND... most important of all, perhaps, in 'The Guardian', the story is done well. Clichéd, true, but very good. I enjoyed myself immensely, I NEVER checked my watch, even once! And upon leaving the cinema, I was very glad I attended. I gave this a very solid 8 out of 10.",The Guardian

Starring Kevin COstner, Ashton Kutcher, Sela Ward, Melissa Sagemiller, Clancy Brown, Omari Hardwick, Alex Daniels, Adam pena, Joe Arquette-- The story of a friendship formed between a hotshot Coast Guard rookie (Kutcher) and a experienced diver (Costner) is captured well by Fugitive director, Andrew Davis. The relatively inexperienced cast did well and Costner was good in the lead. The film had a good mixture of drama and action and it was well done, i think Davis did it right here and this is somewhat of a gem. this is a good film for the family, or any film enthusiast. its not Oscar material but its a good film and two thumbs up from me.9/10",The Guardian

Does Hollywood water dry faster than non Hollywood water? Is there special drying agents in the water? Do they swim and work in dishwater safe water? That is something that seems to boggle my mind.To be in sub zero temperatures, then to suddenly be dry - face, clothes, hair and their faces are not pale or lifeless.Makes me want to wash my clothes in the ocean - it will dry faster.That aside - I like it.Comparing this movie to something of almost 30 years ago - An Officer & A Gentlema is just plain dumb. Many viewers are under 25 years old and never even heard of that movie - it's a new time era and for today's viewing public, comparing it to something they had never seen is just useless.I had watch An Officer & A Gentleman when I was young, I can't recall it, so it A:) didn't stand out B:) wasn't really good or C:) I did't like it.This played out fine.I was not blown away with it, but I enjoyed it.The only part that I didn't like - is when the bar fight happened.Is it mandatory that every national armed service group has to bicker and fight with each other when entering a drinking establishment? I think not.So that is something I wasn't really impressed with - the ""we're better than the others"" routine standard obligatory armed forces bar fight.",The Guardian
46,the-movie-guy,A film that finally gives the Coast Guard the tribute they deserve,8,27 September 2006,"(Synopsis) Coast Guard Rescue Swimmer Ben Randall (Kevin Costner) is the only survivor after his helicopter is forced down and crashes into the water during a rescue mission at sea. Ben is coping with the loss of his entire crew when he is assigned to teach at the Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers School. He doesn't want any other men to die during a rescue, so he uses his own training methods that put the new recruits through the toughest test they will ever encounter during a mission. Jake Fisher (Ashton Kutcher) is one of his raw recruits and Ben takes him under his wing. With Ben's training and Jake's dedication, Jake becomes the best of the best.(My Comment) This was a terrific movie about the Coast Guard rescue swimmers and the missions they perform. Kevin Costner does a great job and Ashton Kutcher surprised me in that he was a serious actor in this film. Both deliver powerful performances interacting with each other's character. The demanding physical training, dedication, and personal sacrifice that all Coast Guard rescue swimmers must go through, make all of them heroes to me. They live every day by their motto, ""So Others May Live."" The Coast Guard doesn't get the same public exposure as other branches of the military, but this film finally gives them the long overdue tribute they deserve. There are only 280 rescue swimmers in the entire Coast Guard. Stay and see the credits because they show actual Coast Guard rescues from Hurricane Katrina. I highly recommend everyone going to see this movie. (Touchstone Pictures, Run time 2:16, Rated PG-13)(8/10)",The Guardian

I like Kevin Costner and do not know Ashton Kutcher's work. What I enjoyed most was to see the training and the operation of the Coast Guards swim team rescue force. This is a familiar story of the aged veteran swimmer, who scorns the young trainee and then comes to like him and take him under his wing. Same story but different location. Sela Ward was good as the veterans wife, who is about to get a divorce. The rest of the cast is adequate in their roles. I would say to wait for the DVD to come out and save yourself eight or ten bucks. If you are into seeing the work of the swim team rescue team then you might want to see it on the big screen as there are some good sea shots.",The Guardian
49,Flagrant-Baronessa,2½ hour long padded-out advertisement for the National Coast Guard,6,10 February 2007,"... and yet, altogether watchable. Big-shot legendary rescuer Ben Randall (Kevin Costner) loses his whole crew out at sea in a rescue mission gone wrong, as well as his marriage, and is instructed to take a ""time-out"" to teach at a prestigious coast guard school. He trains ""the best of the best, of the best, sir..."" and one of his students is Jake (Ashton Kutcher) is a cocky whippersnapper fresh out of high school with swimming medals by the bucketload, more interested in setting records than in saving lives.Predictably, ""The Guardian"" serves heartfelt American morals and messages en masse in building a bond between the mentor and his rookie student. Kevin Costner is a readily-molded veteran hero, passably virile for the role and effortless in his leading quality. Ashton Kutcher is at least not notably bad in his acting efforts, especially when the grueling coast guard training sessions demand our attention and sympathy for his character. As ever in army films, a kind of Top Gun homoeroticism is hilariously displayed throughout.Curiously enough, in spite of its paint-by-numbers army set-up and parallel Wolfgang Peterson-esquire sea actioneer approach, the film elicits surprising attention, even in the bloated ""I have high hopes for you"" speeches by Mr. Costner. Perhaps this stems from its grounded relations basis; there is undeniably a lot of deeply-rooted character problems below the surface both in Ben and Jake's pasts. In the former case, his devotion to the guard is almost self-destructive, which aptly translates in his unconventionally harsh teaching methods (""Tread water for an hour, or go home""). In the latter's case, his adolescence is plagued by a traumatizing event.""The Guardian"" is ultimately a film with technicalities and formalities so dutifully sketched out from opening to closing credits that a computer could code for the same film had it been programmed to do so. You will probably be able to anticipate every up and down of the journey, and even the rare comical moments sings notes I have heard before, even toward the end with the cheesy credit note nodding to Hurricane Katrina, cementing it as an extended advertisement for the National Coast Guard. But with bouts of well-special-effected action at sea, ""The Guardian"" remains a fully passable film. 6 out of 10",The Guardian

After an accident where the old man loses his entire chopper crew through no fault of his, he goes to teach some young kids entering the coast guard rescue swimmers program to unwind. He meets the a bunch of youngsters and teaches them the real rescue swimmers life while befriending a youngster that shows great potential. Mainly about personal relationships, this film has some good special effects, but is not meant to be a film about effects. The seasoned actors and good directing keep your attention through the vast majority of the film. The only question is  what does the future hold for the stars? Well worth the watch.",The Guardian
51,PudgyPandaMan,""" There will come a time when you might have to decide who lives and dies out there.""",6,2 March 2009,"Overall, I enjoyed the movie. It kept my attention, even though it ran a little longer than necessary. I think it was good to bring the Coast Guard's story to the big screen. I grew up in a coastal town and heard many stories of the rescues they accomplished. It was good to see the behind the scenes training and dedication it takes to do what they do.My biggest complaint is the choice of casting Costner in the lead role as the aging Rescue Swimmer. He was 50 when this was filmed and it just doesn't seem feasible that someone that age, regardless of past experience, would still be jumping out of helicopters in the freezing waters of the Bering Sea. Granted, they dealt with his age in the sense that he was nearing the end of his career, he had lots of aches and pains, took meds, etc. But I think he would have long since been forced out of active rescues.The story has shadings of OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN, and TOP GUN. I didn't mind this so much because they did a good job of developing the characters and relationships throughout.My teenage daughter in the first 5 minutes stated she knew ""the old guy would die in the end"". So there is a little predictability here. Especially the way the start the movie with ""There is a legend..."" - and even the title THE GUARDIAN gives it away as well.I loved the cinematography of the rescues scenes. Wow, those ocean swells at night were especially menacing and well shot. It showed what a truly unforgiving and devastating force the ocean is - not like the beautiful and calm beaches most of us associate with the ocean. The cave rescue was especially amazing.I'm not a huge Ashton Kutcher fan, but he holds his own pretty well here. Costner's line delivery continues to be stiff at times as he is known for. But he does bring a sympathetic element to his role - but again, I had a problem with is age in general not being realistic.Overall, still a decent movie in spite of the shortcomings. It really helped me better appreciate the many sacrifices the lesser known Coast Guard makes... SO OTHERS MAY LIVE.",The Guardian
52,dvc5159,"Heroic, yes, but we've seen it all before.",6,9 February 2007,"I watched this movie a day ago and I thought to myself, ""this has been done before."" Remember 'Top Gun""? But the stereotypic plot is saved by strong performances and amazing special effects.Same old story, boy wants to be the best, boy becomes best but gets way over his head, mentor teaches boy life lessons. But here, the chemistry between the two leads, Costner and Kutcher, are astounding. Really, had it not been for the stereotypic plot, both of them could have gotten Golden Globe nominations, on my opinion.Special effects also rule here, the rescue scenes are realistic and pulse-pounding, and the climax is absolutely stunning. The standout in this movie is Kutcher himself, and we've been ""Punk'D"" to believe that he has no talent. Recap: He's got talent! And I thought he was a handsome actor with a jackass personality. BTW, this is not his first serious performance (See ""The Butterfly Effect (2004)"") Director Davis seems to like star power. I mean, he made Steven Seagal a star by making him kick ass in Above The Law (1988) and Under Siege (1991), made his buddy Tommy Lee Jones an even bigger star when Davis' 1993 film, The Fugitive, won Jones a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. That film was Davis' standalone best, and not even this film comes close to it. But it looks like he made a star out of Ashtom Kutcher.Overall, an above average film, with good actors and special effects, but the story lacks originality. Decent if you want a fun time out at the movies or if you have nothing to do.6.5/10",The Guardian
53,gary-444,"Routine, Formulaic Fare",4,27 January 2008,"Now there is nothing wrong with the formulaic action film genre itself, and setting it amongst the Coastguards watching over the Bering Sea, seems like a nice variant. But sadly this picture never lifts its head above the routine, and the ""officer and a Gentleman "" references are crude and crass.Kevin Costner pretty much sleep walks through the role of Ben Randall, the salty sea dog with a past,whilst Ashton Kutcher as Jake Fischer, the rough recruit sure to make good, excels.The ""training scenes"" are so hackneyed and derivative of so many action and Vietnam films that they stumble to a conclusion bereft of originality or dramatic tension.The action scenes are fine, but there is a limit to what you can do with howling winds, cascading water, bodies bobbing up and down , and not much opportunity to drive dialogue.At two hours, it just overstays its welcome, and is unlikely to be remembered by critics, or fans.",The Guardian
54,cosmic_quest,A worthy tribute to the fourth emergency service,7,24 October 2006,"Living in a country where the seas can be very precarious and boating rescues are fairly commonplace, it is heart-lifting to see a film which celebrates the fantastic work that the Coast Guard do in a manner that does this great service justice.The premise of 'The Guardian' is rather simple. Veteran Coast Guard rescue swimmer Ben Randall struggles to cope when his team is killed in a mission at sea so he decides leave the action behind for a while and to take a post teaching at a United States Coast Guard academy. He quickly becomes known as one of the toughest instructors among the young recruits where he is strictest on Jake Fischer, a young man with great potential but has problems working in a team. But both are men with similarly tragic pasts, which serve to bond them as Fischer graduates and takes on a job as a rescue swimmer.Kevin Costner, who plays Randall, proves he is starting to overcome the stint in his acting career as he gives a strong, effective performance in his role, bringing to his character a quality that leaves the audience in awe of this everyday hero who, at the core, just a normal man trying to do a job he cares passionately about. Ashton Kutcher is another pleasant surprise in his role as Fischer, proving he can actually play a decent, mature adult instead of the overgrown teenager he tends to appear as in other projects. The two are well supported by equally excellent performances from Clancy Brown, Sela Ward, Brian Geraghty and Neal McDonough.While 'The Guardian' did have a few clichéd moments-- such as during a rescue, everything that can wrong, did go wrong-- the overall story was handled in a manner that wasn't too condescending or gung-ho. It was a film that strongly depicted the hard-work, dedication and bravery required of Coast Guard recruits and the precarious rescues those qualified have to perform. But it also featured characters who were engaging and very human.This was, overall, an entertaining film with plenty of action and well-depicted characters but it also was one which reminded the audience to appreciate the selfless service that the Coast Guard provides. I wish that the British film industry pay more attention to films, like this which brings much-needed exposure to those involved in good vocations, instead of focusing on drug dealers, council slums and thugs.",The Guardian
55,arieliondotcom,Spoilers: Costner and Kutcher Competing for Kudos,7,15 June 2008,"The Guardian (and did anyone notice how popular this title was when searching for it?) is okay for what it is. It's a sort of chick flick, a soggy remake of an Officer and a Gentleman in a way, and a lot of the scenes are direct rip-offs of that film. Hero helps an up and coming newbie to fill his shoes (swimfins?) and they both learn life lessons along the glubb, glubb...The ending (which I was surprised to read in the trivia section is an alternate...thankfully) saved the film, because it would have ruined the entire movie if it hadn't ended the way it did. The whole premise of the title, etc. is built on it. (Obviously a second thought after the change, but still.) It was a very, very wise choice.I'm the most shocked of all Ashton Kutcher fans. I really admire his acting (and you've got to admire him in real life for competing with Bruce Willis of all people for a woman). He largely makes the movie as well.You can probably guess how the movie ends without any spoilers on my part, but here comes one anyway ISPOILER). You know the ending is Officer and a Gentleman-like, as I said. No surprises there. However, pay attention. When he (okay, I won't tell you which one) comes into the classroom to sweep his love off her feet in his full officer uniform, pay attention to the kids in the class. They've just been given a drawing assignment and look bored until they see their teacher start smooching on her returned love. Then the little oriental girl closest to the camera begins drawing like crazy. It's hysterical and the best part of the movie. LOL.",The Guardian
56,Jay_Exiomo,"The film barely floats in clichés, oorah!",6,11 October 2006,"""The Guardian"" ain't ""The Sentinel"" despite the proximity implied by their names. While the latter is a political thriller, the former is more a tribute film that is supposedly created to make the audience recognize the valor and unselfishness of one of America's group of unsung heroes: namely the US Coast Guard. But both films have something in common: they're too riddled with clichés of their respective genres to really stand out and leave a lasting impression long after one leaves the theater.Kevin Costner stars as the legendary Ben Randall who is rumored to have saved at least 200 people during his service as a US Coast Guard rescue Swimmer. But one failed rescue attempt at sea during a storm that cost his rescue partner's life traumatizes him. Jolted by the incident, he is sent to teach for one year at the Coast Guard training school while he tries to recover.Enter Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher in a relatively more subdued dramatic performance than in ""The Butterfly Effect""), a cocky hotshot candidate for the USCG's aviation survival technician program. Subjected to Randall's unorthodox training methods, Jake - along with his classmates - learn about teamwork, sacrifice, and altruism.Director Andrew Davis (""The Fugitive"") succeeds in dramatizing the heroism the US Coast Guard crew carries out on a regular basis. The rescue scenes are gripping, and the effects are realistic. What sinks the film is Ron Brinkerhoff's script that can't provide a fresh idea on what's been done before in ""Top Gun"" or ""An Officer and a Gentleman"". Similarly the characters all develop pro forma, with their respective compulsory conflicts to deal with. Clocking in at over 2 hours, the pacing draws heavily as there isn't much more to the film than what it tries to present, which ultimately makes it a mostly ordinary melodrama.Costner hasn't been much to the big screen lately and most of his movies were more or less forgettable, but he still brings a distinctive commanding quality to his role, and it fits him nicely. Kutcher is okay as the young student. The role doesn't call for him to stretch his limited thespian skills; nonetheless he manages to give a decent performance.""The Guardian"" is a film devoid of significance with an unoriginal plot that never involves. But while it's far from being an excellent film, it scores enough points to warrant it a shot for the undemanding viewer.",The Guardian
57,TheMovieMark,Interesting look at an under-appreciated group of heroes,8,29 September 2006,"I was looking forward to The Guardian, but when I walked into the theater I wasn't really in the mood for it at that particular time. It's kind of like the Olive Garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it.I'm not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit. The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last Kevin Costner movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld. Plus, despite the promise Ashton Kutcher showed in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold on him. Something about the guy just annoys me. Probably has to do with his simian features.It took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away. The movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission, and I was gripped tighter than Kenny Rogers' orange face lift. My concerns briefly bristled at Kutcher's initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious. Sunglasses, a tough guy toothpick in his mouth, and sportin' a smirk that'd make George Clooney proud? Yeah, we get it. I was totally ready to hate him.But then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs. Darn you, ape man! Efficiently mixing tense, exciting rescue scenes, drama, humor, and solid acting, The Guardian is easily a film that I dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy. You can quibble about its clichés, predictability, and rare moments of overcooked sappiness, but none of that takes away from the entertainment value.I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when Costner started training the young guys, but on the contrary, the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film. Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen, so I feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under-appreciated group.Do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer? Just think about it -you get to go on dangerous missions in cold, dark, rough water, and then you must fight disorientation, exhaustion, hypothermia, and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded, panicked people who are depending on you for their survival. And if all that isn't bad enough, sometimes you can't save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who dies.Man, who wants all that responsibility? Not me! I had no idea what it was really like for these guys, and who would have thought I'd have an Ashton Kutcher/Kevin Costner movie to thank for the education? Not only does The Guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero, but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers.THE GIST Moviegoers wanting an inside look at what it's like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give The Guardian a chance.

Great acting by Kevin Costner. He portrayed Ben Randall really well. Ashton Kutcher takes the cake on this one. All I know about this guy is that he's the dude who Punk'd celebrities and the guy from 'Dude, Where's my Car?'. But I was surprised that he's doing serious drama roles now.

His character in ""The Guardian"" reminds me of the one he played in ""Message in a Bottle"" (not a fan of Nicholas Sparks). While Ben Randall is not much of an original character, co-staring with Ashton Kutcher in ""An Officer and a Gentleman""/""Top Gun"" kinda movie was quite cool. I never thought Kutcher could pull off such a role, he's not that bad of an actor, I think he should challenge himself with more roles like this or the womanizer Nikki in ""Spread"".The movie itself sends a powerful message about the Coast Guard.

I knew rescues were performed, but didn't know there was a special unit within the USCG for this purpose. This is the first time these USCG units have been given wide publicity to my knowledge. And, my hat is off to all of them. They deserve all the recognition they can get. As for the movie I can almost hear some say, ""Hey, Costner is in another water movie.

Yes, there are some predictable scenes but you need to include them here, the most demanding training schedule Randall has imposed, the girl in the bar Jake gets close to, the fight with the Navy men in the Navy Bar. You need to see the whole picture and it's in here. The training sessions were terrific, and one can learn a few things just sitting there watching the movie. The action scenes are spectacular and I am not sure if CGI was involved, but those scenes looked very real to me. All in all this production is excellent, the acting, the dialogue, the cinematography and the story itself. However, I did count 3-times I thought the movie was over and yet, it kept going and I was glad of it. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: One F bomb and you can miss it because Costner is looking away from the camera.",The Guardian

I mean, they even had Costner hosing down Kutcher, just as Lou Gossett did to Richard Gere in ""...Gentleman."" That being said, I enjoyed the film. As a former Navy helicopter crewman, I admit to being biased in favor of a film about a job for which I trained, so take my comments with that in mind. The action was great, with excellent special effects. Ashton-baby can even swim! I was concerned about what seemed to be severe procedural inaccuracies until I saw the credits, and learned how many actual Coasties were consulted AND in the cast. Even with their input, though, I can't believe they would've flown away with a man inside a foundering vessel. A delightful surprise for me was Bonnie Bramlett as the bartender. The woman is a decent actress with an INCREDIBLE singing voice, a cross between Janis Joplin and Beverly Sills, and at this stage of life the experience and soul behind it to really deliver a song. I loved her in 1972, lost track of her until a superior Rosanne episode brought her back to the public eye (and ear), and am very glad to see her once more. If you'd care to hear her, dig out your mom's vinyl copy of ""Delaney and Bonnie and Friends on the Road with Eric Clapton."" If you don't love her voice, you don't like music. ...but I digress. I thought killing off K.C.'s character was unnecessary, actually thought he'd be rescued with A.K. I haven't watched ""Alternate Ending"" on the DVD yet, but some other comments tell me that it's the one I would have chosen for the final version of this film.

63,ryancm,So so,5,6 June 2007,"While not entirely a miss, THE GUARDIAN could have been better. Hats off to the Coast Guard, but the story line could have been better. This was a paint-by-numbers screen play. Not at all original, and much too many clichés'. Acting is OK, with no great shakes. But as written, not even the best actors could do much with the material, although better actors could probably save it a bit. Too much attention to the Kutcher and Kostner characters, while the others go by the wayside. Not good writing. What happened to the cute gal in the gang? You'll have to watch the deleted scenes on the DVD. The movie would have been much better if it had ended without the predictable resolution. Again, see the DVD for the more ""happier"" ending. However, both endings were terrible. And the final scene with Kutcher going to the classroom of his girlfriend was just too corny for words. The best things about the movie were the training scenes and the rescue sequences. Forget the rest. Boy oh boy, am I tired of the Special EFFECTS. They look just like that...EFFECTS, not real.",The Guardian
64,samseescinema,full and well-navigated,7,28 September 2006,"The Guardian reviewed by Sam OsbornFilms so rarely give themselves space to breath. They constrict their running length to a bite-sized 90 minutes and rush a tale out as from a factory. The Guardian is by no means original, and it never wants us to believe otherwise. It's a genre film through and through, but it's a genre film that gives itself time. Two hours and fifteen minutes worth, in fact. And although 135 minute films are no surprise for Academy-luring dramas (and soon you'll hear us plea for shorter fare), a formula flick that's stretched to such lengths is worth mentioning.Kevin Costner plays Ben Randall, an aging Coast Guard rescue swimmer married more to his job than his wife, Helen (Sela Ward). She's leaving him, packing away and moving from their home in Kodiak, Alaska to file divorce. Mr. Costner's playing his favorite hangdog here, graying and jaded with ineffable honor and that quiet, somber pride his characters always seem to grow into. And he's still young enough to play an action hero, as proved by the savory rescue sequences The Guardian mounts. Filmed partly in massive, wave-making studios and partly with impressive CGI, these sequences manage to render the treacherous sea in horrifying detail. Costner's asked (or more likely Costner's stunt double is asked) to leap from an orange helicopter and navigate the mean, nasty sea until he can yank a flailing victim into a basket that's connected by wire to the hovering aircraft above. Director Andrew Davis succeeds in molding these rescue scenes into bracingly taut action sequences that don't involve the usual requisite combat. Isn't it refreshing when visceral excitement can be stirred up in the movies without the use of violence? Anyway, on a particularly risky rescue, Ben insists upon entering the water despite requests from the control room to restrain. He's given five minutes to extract the victims and by the time five minutes has passed, Ben's helicopter has crashed and he's huddled in a lifeboat cradling the corpse of his best friend. Now properly humbled and depressed, Ben is transferred to A-School to handle the training of the incoming students. Among them is Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher), a hotshot swimmer who turned down a volley of Ivy League scholarships to work in the Coast Guard. He's arrogant, foolhardy and headstrong: ideal for inspirational fodder. But The Guardian, as is its best trait, takes the appropriate time to inspire us. Ben and Randall are developed nicely, with quaint sub-plots to complement their stories and the obligatory confrontation followed by the grunt and jerky handshake. Andrew Davis obviously has respect for the Coast Guard, and his scenes of training convince us of the institution's glory. Thankfully, he doesn't venture into patriotic territory, hyping up the organization as inspirational films about the Army or Marines often do. His respect lies mostly in awe of the Coast Guard process and the will it takes to survive in it. A lot of doubt has been raised as to whether Ashton Kutcher, our favorite ""Punk'd"" legend, can pull off action hero. The answer is, why not? He's already proved he's a charmer of the easy, laid back sort, and proved he can eek out a dramatic role in The Butterfly Effect, so why can't he buff up enough to grimace in pain and shed a manly tear? So to answer to your doubts, Kutcher does just fine. The Guardian is a big-huge genre film; one that plays its game and knows how to play it well. Few of its elements are exceptionalsave for its rescue sequencesbut they're solid and acceptable clichés to drive the story. And the story is full. It's full and well-navigated to spin one of the few rousing adventures told about the Coast Guard. Rating: 3 out of 4-Sam Osborn",The Guardian

Kutcher is a staple in comedy, but he's just as good in serious roles (see: ""Butterfly Effect""). He and Costner were an excellent pair, working together and against one another at the same time it seemed. Kutcher's classmates were also great, especially Hodge and Lindsey. I recognized Clancy Brown from ""The Shawshank Redemption"" but I think I prefer this character more.I believe that ""A"" School is difficult, but seeing it in the movie did help a little. I love movies that are based on real groups, like ""Act of Valor"" and ""G.I. Jane"", but what set this apart was the connection between Costner and Kutcher.

We saw a great reduction in daring, but novel plots and Hollywood started churning out films with reused plots, predictable endings, moderate acting and ""crosses the Ts"" style of film making, producing an ultimately forgettable product. This spanned across action, comedy and drama films and since then, we're seldom treated to an interesting movie.The guardian is not an interesting movie. Amazingly, the film had a large budget though it was difficult to work out how this was consumed, given most of the film was shot in and around an indoor pool.The teacher is brilliant with a distinguished career, but battling his demons arising out of a tragic event (yawn) and a cocky new recruit with bad attitude and loads of talent (yawn) who ends of walking the straight and narrow to become a true hero everyone knows that he is (yawn).Costner and Kutcher were fairly well matched and acting was reasonable given the material, but the cardboard cutout nature of the plot was just such as a disappointment that it overshadowed any positives.Even if you saw it at the time it came out, I bet you couldn't remember what it was about these days.",The Guardian

One line by itself, is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad risk.BUT...See The Movie! Despite its downfalls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever. While borrowing so much from other movies it never goes overboard. In fact, you'll probably find yourself battening down the hatches and riding the storm out. Why? ...Costner and Kutcher played their characters very well. I have never been a fan of Kutcher's and I nearly gave up on him in The Guardian, but he surfaced in good fashion. Costner carries the movie swimmingly with the best of Costner's ability. I don't think Mrs. Robinson had anything to do with his success.The supporting cast all around played their parts well. I had no problem with any of them in the end. But some of these characters were used too much.From here on out I can only nit-pick so I will save you the wear and tear.

69,mcsheehey,An Overrated Mess,3,9 June 2007,"Kevin Costner is one of the iconic actors of our time. He's been in more American classics already than most actors are in a lifetime. Ashton Kutcher is one of the iconic bad actors of this new generation. He's never been good in a film, and achieved his actor's ""peak"" as Kelso on ""That 70's Show."" Putting these two actors together for a film is crazy enough. It's like putting Meryl Streep in a film opposite Anna Farris. Even worse, however, the film adopts almost very film cliché known to man. It tells the story of two men, Costner's character being a Coast Guard veteran turned teacher, and Kutcher's role being an ambitious up-and-coming coast Guard wannabe. Obviously, they start out despising each other until they learn more about each other and learn to understand each other's positions. Then of course, they become buddies in a father-son relationship.Picture ""Top Gun"" being put in a blender with ""An Officer and a Gentleman."" Then picture ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""A Lot Like Love"" being thrown into the mix as well. You get an unholy mess. The plot, of course, is really a mix of the first two films mentioned, only with awful performances all around. On the other hand, like Costner's ""Wolves,"" it runs on too long, and like Kutcher's ""A Lot Like Love,"" it's a complete mess.In short, this film is terrible. Costner is given a role that is really a composite of other characters that he has played. Kutcher is bad as usual and makes his character seem like a sleazy idiot. There are training montages set to music, clichéd love stories for both main characters, dull back-stories for the other Coast Guard trainees, and an ""emotional"" story about Kutcher's character. Other than a few interesting facts about the Coast Guard, the film is a stinker. I enjoin you not to see it. It's not even fun to make fun of.",The Guardian
70,justbob1982,A capably assembled parade of clichés,6,13 September 2015,"Version I saw: UK DVD releaseActors: 6/10Plot/script: 5/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 5/10Overall: 6/10You can imagine the production meeting. Costner and Kutcher were middle-sized names, with their own followings, so it seemed reasonable to put them together in a middle-budget film. Costner has moved on from action heroes and romantic leads to grizzled military types and father figures, and Ashton makes an effective cocky young recruit who will grow under his tutelage. Throw in the idea of shining the spotlight on a less glamorous area of the military, and the rest pretty much writes itself. Basically, it's An Officer and a Gentleman with helicopter sea rescuers instead of air force pilots. It's really that blatant.Presumably that is why they gave it to comparative screen writing novice Ron L Brinkerhoff, and he does a decent job of putting tab A into slot B, adding in some (I assume) well-researched details that enhance the Coastguard training academy scenes, and finessing some of the character interactions with a bit of extra metaphor and frisson. The whole thing plays to a moderately right-wing middle-American patriotic audience, with a soundtrack comprising mostly pop and country music.Both of the leads are accomplished but not inspired. Costner has the experience and charisma to come across as likable even while playing the unnecessarily cruel, hard taskmaster, and Kutcher does better as the cocky douchebag than the sensitive hero, but he stops well short of disgracing himself.The director is a safe bet. Andrew Davis is probably best known for action thrillers Under Siege and The Fugitive. He brings his skill with those action set-pieces to the couple of (presumably quite expensive) helicopter rescue scenes, generating a really visceral sense of the danger and discomfort. He can also be trusted to not make a mess of the character interaction dialogue scenes.I found the whole reasonably diverting, if rather forgettable. One to watch when you are feeling a bit fragile, and not in the mood for anything at all challenging.",The Guardian
71,sinncross,Washed up...,6,24 October 2006,"The Guardian tells the story of Ben Randall, a USGG rescue swimmer, who comes into contact with Jake Fisher, a swimming champ, who is attending a USGG rescue swimmer trainee camp. The story serves as a high point, but not without a few problems. We are first introduced to Ben (Kevin Costner) while on a rescue mission. It's an intense opening, which is enhanced a scene later, when Ben's wife is leaving him, because of the emotional strain his work has on their relationship. This hardship for Ben becomes ever worse, when his very next mission takes a turn for the worst, and his best friend is killed. At this point, the film seems to drop into some frivolous waters, when we are introduced to Jake (Ashton Kutcher), who from the start has a very arrogant attitude.The problem lies in the fact that the intensity of the beginning, fades completely to a training squad, with Ben as their instructor. While we see that such a job is not something Ben really wants, most screen time is given to Kutchers hotshot antics. Later on, the story does develop again nicely, and perhaps the frivolous arc in the story serves as en extended metaphor for the growth of Jake, but ultimately, its weak in structure and you can't help but want more of Ben and his dilemmas, which make appearance in the rare occasion.The last scenes prove somewhat coincidental in the attempt to create a sad overtone for the movie, but even these efforts are cut short quickly, with more on Jakes love life  an issue that didn't seem to impressive to begin with. The Guardian also contains a sort of myth about The Guardian who helps many who have been stranded in the seas, but the way in which it is expressed, turns a movie with reality prospects, into a fantastical fairytale  luckily, it's not a problem in the bigger picture.While the frivolous aspects of the film pertain to Kutcher, it doesn't stop Kutcher from being solid in his acting. In fact, he was up to par with the wonderful Costner, and the reality of their respective characters really pushed through with some good characterization.Ultimately, The Guardian never reaches its potential. The opening scenes are hurt by the film that follows, and after it's regained itself, falls yet again. It's not an entirely bad fall, but it all seems out of place. While the action scenes are fun to watch and the story stimulating to boot, The Guardian fails to be the drama it should have been.",The Guardian

73,PerryAtTheMovies,One of my all-time favourites and a must-see....,6,22 February 2021,"Initial Thoughts:
Although I give this film a 6/10 it is still one of my all-time favourite movies. For me it's the story. It's about a man, played by Kevin Costner, who would risk it all ""So others may live"". He never boasts about his heroics, and he never goes looking for spotlight. He does what he needs to do and he gets it done. On the other side you have this kid, played by Ashton Kutcher, who is cocky and full of himself. He is looking for the spotlight and he wants everyone to notice him. The great thing about this movie is the balance between the two characters. Great things come to an end, but they can be followed by even greater things, such as this young gun coming in and replace the guard.There's not a whole lot of downside in this film for me other than the graphics/animations. They look terrible and kind of takeaway the emotional aspects of the film if you're like me and you focus on them too hard. Though I interpret this film as the changing of the guard and always serving with honour. I still wish that the supporting cast would've been stronger. For me they are just kind of there. Specifically, Ben with his soon to be ex-wife and with the commander of the school. There's just not enough there to have a well-rounded emotional impact.Overall:
This is a film I love and would definitely recommend to anyone who likes military type movies. Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher bring great chemistry as the leads, and while the graphics aren't great, for me, and do somewhat takeaway from the gripping emotion of the film, it's still a must-see.""Should I watch this movie?""

While Ben Randall is not much of an original character, co-staring with Ashton Kutcher in ""An Officer and a Gentleman""/""Top Gun"" kinda movie was quite cool. I never thought Kutcher could pull off such a role, he's not that bad of an actor, I think he should challenge himself with more roles like this or the womanizer Nikki in ""Spread"".The movie itself sends a powerful message about the Coast Guard.

In fact, it borrows heavily from both, and liberally pickpockets from ""Top Gun,"" ""Full Metal Jacket,"" ""Gomer Pyle, USMC"" and a little bit of Ron Howard's ""Backdraft,"" as well.This doesn't mean watching it is a negative experience, just one we've seen much of it before. Thank goodness director Andrew Davis (""The Fugitive,"" ""Holes"") appropriates the good parts of other movies, leaving most of the garbage behind.Plotwise, Senior Chief Petty Officer Ben Randall, an icon among USCG lifesavers, moans and groans, chews pain pills and watches as his wife, Helen (Sela Ward, ""Day After Tomorrow,"" TV series ""House""), walks out on him. He's a hero, though, and heroes always hurt the ones they love - all in the call of duty.He's still the best in his outfit, though, putting himself in harm's way to pull mostly undeserving people from sinking private craft and fishing boats, he earns a reputation as one of the branches most prolific rescuers.But because his profession has caused the dissolution of his marriage, he threatens to quit the service. He is ultimately persuaded by his C.O. (Clancy Brown, ""The Shawshank Redemption"") to transfer from Kodiak, Alaska to Florida and train a bunch of rescue swimmer wanna-bes, including macho Jake Fischer (Kutcher).During these scenes, we get to see an update of the old ""tough-as-nails-instructor-with-the-heart-of-gold"" cliché we've seen a dozen times.Thankfully, a few new angles are thrown into the mix and we avoid a lot of past movie pitfalls. For example, we're introduced to a muscle-bound Brandon Molale (""Mission: Impossible 3""), who leads us to believe he will be a major antagonist, but is soon booted out; other characters appear and then leave the scene, just as in real military training situations.Ultimately, though, it's the relationship between Randall and Fischer that moves to the forefront. The latter believing he is ordained to be a great rescuer because of his high school swim team credentials; the former, realizing the kid's potential, but also trying to knock the arrogant punk down a few notches.Eventually, upon graduation, a plot convenience allows both men to be stationed in Alaska, where a concluding storm and sinking of a fishing boat allows one of the men to pull off the ultimate sacrifice, a la ""Backdraft.""

77,Jona1988,So boring...,5,4 October 2010,"Maybe this is a pretty realistic portrayal of the work and training of so called rescue swimmers. However this is not a documentary film, at least the presentation of it suggests it is an dramatic adventure experience. Tagline: When lives are on the line, sacrifice everything. Sure some of the tech shown are quite interesting but if one is after information about this kind of work you would be better of with a real documentary picture. So the parts witch show how the rescue operations are done and the training to become one is well made the rest is below decent. There is close to zero substance in both the characters and the story. Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher make an OK performance, I guess it's the script that lacks anything for them to work with. I blame the script as the reason that the ""heroes"" are feel simply bland. Some of the characters actually feel pretty unlikable. But some films manage to create something even from minimal material which brings me to the direction. Director Andrew Davis I associate with The Fugitive, one of the best thrillers of the 1990s. The guardian lack everything that The Fugitive did so great. Well they are pretty different kind of films but I still feel really disappointed, partly considering the film was marked ""From the director of The Fugitive"". The scenes that are supposed to thrill are really poorly done it feels shockingly dull, almost bad directing. Several points of the story are stolen from other successful films. This just makes it so predictable and repeating old overused ground. Plot twists one can spot ages beforehand. Since the characters feel impossible to relate to the points witch are meant to touch the sentimental part of you are just extremely tiresome.

To recoup, he's more or less forced to teach a new class of recruits. Here he meets Kutcher, who gives his best acting performance to date, and instant friction occurs.Kutcher is driven to be the best and Costner digs throughout the movie to find that reason... the story works.

In his newly acquired teaching position, Bill Randall, played by the constantly dull Kevin Costner, encounters the witty, younger version of himself, Jake Fischer, played by the amusingly stubborn headed Ashton Kutcher. I know you've seen this before, and you know you've seen this before, but why not re-vamp this old-school meets new-school story again, and bring it to the water.Kutcher, who keeps this picture afloat, proves in The Guardian, that he not only has the looks but the humor to keep the pulse of this film beating to his drum. Hopefully Kutcher will stop seeking out these dramatic roles and truly grasp his meaning within the comedic genre he clearly urges to delve out of. Costner did keep me slightly riveted with his ""tough guy"" trainer attitude and his strict regiment. Although I was apathetic to some of the films slower, crawling moments, it did seem to suck me back into the action with its high production and frequent nail-biting suspense.Unfortunately this is not an original, surprise yielding film, but despite its derivative material it is a noteworthy Top Gun mimic.

It is about making peace with yourself regarding the life and death decisions that have to be made. Yes, okay, there is sentimentality but this is because it is following the life of a person under circumstances that could be real, in fact, there may be someone out there as I write this who is out at sea being Ben Randall. The role of Kevin Costner reminds me of John Wayne in Hellfighters, a true story of the man 'Red' Adaire. It is too complicated to reiterate here - if you haven't seen it, you must!!! At one point, though, John's estrange daughter asks a mutual friend why he let his wife go. She was told that he loved her more than anything but that Wayne was the best at what he did and 'no man can walk away from that.' In all, I believe that this showed a well rounded movie.

Maybe its not as impressive as what the search and rescue swimmers go through, but it is darned impressive. And he is in fantastic physical shape, like the fellows in this movie.

84,someofusarebrave,"Well, All Right Then",4,26 February 2011,"This could definitely have been a better movie.It could have been a worse one too, but. Well.I am not trying to denounce what this movie attempted to do. I think it is brave to attempt to trace a frakked-up teenager's journey from a loud-mouthed, grieving kid whose sadness has turned to anger, into an excellent, brave and capable human being.I just happen to think that process is a lot more complicated than suddenly becoming great at something I happened to be great at anyway.I also think it's a lot easier to offer the sort of absolution, forgiveness and redemption this Teacher is offering to his Pupil when the pupil happens to excel at one of the things he is being taught.I think it's high time we as a society stop deeming sports skillz the kind of talent that makes somebody 'great' as a person, rather than simply as an athlete.Growing up as a man has got to come to mean more than succeeding at football or baseball--or, in this case, swimming. It has got to come to mean more than successfully throwing a ball or running faster than anybody else around. This movie only offers half the story.Yes, Ashton Kutchers' character does try to reach beyond the typical athlete persona by attempting to become a member of the Coast Guard.However, once there, he does nothing but screw up.Because he is ""great"" at swimming, however, he never once has to face the consequences. He simply sails along getting into barfights, snarling at his supposed teammates and mouthing off to his superiors.All in all, he clearly has some ambivalence about being a ""hero."" None of that matters because he is a great swimmer ergo he seems presumed by all to have every right to get into a 'few minor scraps' along the road to the sure success his superiors all predict for him.This cute, small-town white boy is thus taken under the wings of several older, good-ole-boy types and made into a man--or their version.Somehow, he is also surrounded by a team of other boys--and teachers--who look exactly like him. Oh, there is one black student and one black teacher just for the sake of paying lip service to diversity...but they have about six lines combined. The ONLY female rescue swimmer has got literally just about one line during the movie.The screenwriters pay no attention to the difficulties that any of these people would surely face in any military institution, nor to the complexity of the issues surrounding their entrance into it.Of course not.This is an easy movie, designed to provide easy answers to complex questions. It is designed to trace the 'hero's journey' of one white boy who really does not so much deserve the opportunities he is given.It is designed to give a second chance to a man who would not need it if he had not given in to his depression and hidden out for a year to begin with, then decided the solution to his internal agony was to ""save"" other people. This has never in the his- and her- stories of the world provided an effective solution to intense grief.Too bad we still have so many movies that suggest otherwise.",The Guardian
85,supah79,Respect for the sacrifice vs. respect for the movie-going public,5,6 March 2007,"With these kinda films, I'm always torn between two thoughts: I want to judge the film on it's own merits. But I also want to respect the men and woman (in uniform) the film portrays. It's like George W. Bush telling me to respect the men and women fighting terror: I don't agree with his policy, but the men and woman he sends abroad fighting terror deserve and do earn my respect. So my conclusion: the men and women of the Coast Guard deserve a film like this, but the movie-going public deserved a better film.The Guardian doesn't separate itself by anything other than a cool movie poster. The script is corny (and borrows heavily from films like An Officer and a Gentleman), the production is pretty bland and the special effect are not that good. And then there is the acting: Costner walks around like he hasn't been inspired by a role in years and Kutcher... he should stay doing pranks: because the kid CAN NOT ACT.Overall is this is like many other ""homage to the uniform"" films (like We Were Soldiers, Ladder 49 etc.): the people portrayed deserve our respect, but we deserve, as paying film fans, a better film.",The Guardian
86,nived84,"""So others may live.""",5,17 September 2006,"The Guardian is a decent movie that serves as a long overdue tribute to the men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard. Call it a wet version of Ladder 49 if you want, because that's not too far from the truth. I haven't seen many films take a good look at the jobs of the Coast Guard and until now I'd say the best attempt was in Wolfgang Petersen's The Perfect Storm. In The Guardian Kevin Costner stars as a veteran Coast Guard rescue diver Ben Randall. After suffering a terrible accident and losing several crew members of his rescue team on one unforgiving night on the dangerous seas Ben finds himself coming to terms with the tragedy and haunted by reoccurring nightmares. He's assigned to teach new divers at a training camp facility where he meets a cocky, but surprisingly talented swimmer named Jake Fischer, played by Ashton Kutcher, who actually does look like he could be quite a good swimmer. The majority of the 135 minute running time is spent at the training camp, in which the new cadedets are pushed to their maximum capability, and many of them find themselves ""washing out"", not able to live up to the high standards needed to become an official Coast Guard diver.The second act, which mostly deals with the training process, is a tad too long, and does seem to drag the movie on, but none of these scenes are boring, or not entertaining. The movie is quite often humorous and enjoyable (it's always a good sign when the audience laughs at all the right moments), and does a fairly good job at balancing back and forth from human drama to playful comedy. I can forgive the movie for running about 15 or 20 minutes too long, but I still can't help but wonder how better the film would have been if Kutcher had been replaced with another actor, someone who's a little more convincing with pulling off the dramatic or sympathetic moments. Thankfully since there are a number of moments that strive for laughs Kutcher is able to make those moments work, but the best part of the film has to be Kevin Costner as the tough as nails teacher and mentor. He's a perfect choice in casting and easily pulls off the part of the wise and dedicated seasoned professional having a hard time adjusting to old age. Kutcher is a bit of a wild card here. Costner is spot on in his part, but Kutcher seems like an odd choice. I've always enjoyed him on That 70's Show, and have always believed that comedy is he's strong suite. Kutcher does an alright job, and he doesn't derail the rest of the film, but someone like Josh Hartnett or Ryan Phillippe probably would have been a better choice for this part.The film does resemble Ladder 49 in a lot of ways, and both films certainly have their fair share of problems and flaws that should be overlooked, but I think most of the flaws in The Guardian can be overlooked, but certainly not forgotten. The film does get a little sappy near the end, and there's a bit too much use of slow-motion that used to highlight the more emotionally intense moments. There's a great film within the script of The Guardian, but in the hands of a better filmmaker like Ridley Scott, Ron Howard or maybe even Michael Mann would have been much more interesting or thoroughly and emotionally thrilling. Instead director Andrew Davis, whose only real homerun has been 1993's The Fugitive, takes a good and noble idea and turns it into a run of the mill drama about teamwork, sacrifice and courage. Some moments get a little too ""touchy-feely"" at the end, which sounded like a rehash of Big Fish (you'll know what I mean when you hear it), but overall I'd say that this is a decent movie, and as a tribute to the often overlooked and brave men and women of the Coast Guard it works quite well. Should you see it in theaters? Maybe, but I would probably save it for DVD. The Guardian gets my thumb up, and comes close to being a low seven, but I'll settle with giving it a high six instead. You can always do worse, right? Or should I remind you of Annapolis?",The Guardian
87,yarik83,"To Ashton or not to Ashton, that is the question",4,1 November 2011,"So last night I got around to watching guardian. Mixed feelings. For starters it was not necessary to make that movie. There has been at least 20 like it and another 100 or so similar to it. The story itself was played out so many times that it was not interesting to watch at all. So lets start at the beginning. We have Kevin Costner.. OK I can live with that. He passes for a USCG swimmer. Then we have Ashton ""Flamboyant"" Kutcher in the same movie playing an overachiever. What? I mean seriously what? We can not take him serious, it would be like watching Jim Carey do a Kung Fu movie. You can not put Ashton in shoes of a serious role and expect us to believe and more importantly him to perform. That 70's show pretty much set his career of a goofball. Much like Daniel Radcliffe is forever Harry Potter, he is very much the same a Kelso. So that aside lets have a look at the story. Blah blah some guy having family problems, a sailor, big waves, people drowning, saving, his team dies, he needs time to recover, teaches some greenhorns, one of his students is weak, one is an overachiever, blah blah test of character, both together, one retires, dies and other guy continues then drops everything for ""love"". Have we not seen it before? Have we not seen it before many many times? Then of course the ""green screen""... seriously? Why ohh why do people constantly resort to really cheezy computer animation. Watching this movie was like eating glass while sitting on glass and other people throwing glass at you. Painful to eyes, painful to ears because of dialogue and overall I think this movie deserves no more than a 4/10 even with Costner in it. This movie could have been a 10 or at least a 8 by my book if following criteria was met: Graphics equal to or better than what is shown on Discovery channel Alaska Crab Fishing shows. Actual props were used rather than green screen or at least less green screen. Different story that we have not yet heard. No Ashton. I bet you what really happened was Ashton got all upset about people not taking him seriously so he had a movie made just for him to fulfill his boy fantasy of being a tough guy and since nobody else wanted to be in the movie with him he had to beg fading movie stars to at least give his movie some credibility. Good thing that its only a rental and is on its way back to Netflix.",The Guardian
88,rem1010,Could Trigger Flashbacks for Rescue Personnel,10,8 October 2006,"I was very emotionally touched by this film, as it conveys ideas and thoughts from the people that risk their life to save others. I was a Medical Evacuation Pilot in Vietnam, and this movie caused me to question ""Why did I risk my life to save those that I do not know?"". That may seem like a simple question, but the answer I came up with is ""Because I could!"". This movie conveys that concept very well and has a lot of dialog that people that do this type of work, do not speak about. I thought that this movie did a great job expressing that view. However, some of the audience may not relate to this and not see the significance of why these people risk their life and take these chances. It is not for glory or fame or fortune. It is much deeper than that. I know, I did similar work and was shot at many times and shot once. I never knew the people that I saved and I never counted the saved ones, ONLY the ones I could not save. This move is very emotional, especially if you have any experience in this type of work, like firefighters, police, search and rescue, and other work that you cannot truly explain as to why you do it or did it. This movie brought back memories of my killed friends in Vietnam, simply because the situations and objectives were so similar. So, if you are a war veteran or a person that does or did rescue, then you may relate to this movie and it may give you flashbacks to some tragic events.",The Guardian
89,garynorton,"Another ""Gung-Ho"" Recruitment Film.",5,24 October 2006,"Got to see The Guardian via a free ticket offer and was grateful I did not pay for it. It has its moments- the rescue scenes are very well put together, Costner handles the weather beaten and emotionally battered Coastguard veteran character with aplomb; even Kutchner is more bearable than I thought possible.The trouble is that despite its two hour plus running time, it ends up feeling like 3 hours- mainly due to the fact it has very little to add to the extensive and expensive back catalogue of U.S. Military style movies we already know. Think of it as The Perfect Storm meets Top Gun. Add to this a dash of Officer and a Gentlemen. You know the drill; promisingly talented, but gung-ho cadet learns life lessons via his worldly wise veteran instructor and girlfriend. This ""mandatory"" romance is obviously thrown in to try to ensure the movie gets some female demographic footfall (i.e. money) over the cinema threshold. The initial stages of the budding romance between Kutchners cadet and a street wise local school teacher seems to promise more than it delivers. It rapidly deteriorates to the standard template we have seen in the past. Not only this, but the bolt-on corny,romantic ending sits very unevenly with the tragic big rescue finale. We can all see this is where the film should have ended.This may work well as a recruitment video for the Coastguard- and thats one of the other positives you could take from it. At least their job is to save lives! Unfortunately, Top Gun- and the trail of opportunistic drivel that followed it(Iron Eagle etc), used the Guardian's character and story template long before to instill and promote the attitude of the war-mongering world we now live in.That aside, The Guardian, with all its good intentions of team ethic and heroism- is let down by a poorly scripted story we have all seen many times before. Costner deserves better than this. Kutchner? You've been punk'd!",The Guardian

92,jcook56050,Action on the Coast Guard flight line,7,29 September 2014,"As you watch, please remember ""The Guardian"" is a motion picture – a lot of the scenes are played in a way that will elicit certain emotions. Some of the scenes are just plain fantasy. However, that being said, please also remember that there are thousands of individuals who serve their country daily in the U. S. Coast Guard, a military service now under the Department of Homeland Security, but previously directed by the Department of Transportation. They serve at sea, on land and in the air. Much of the drama and danger depicted in the film is more than real. These situations happen far more often than you would imagine. How do I know? I served in the USCG from 1976 to 1984 several decades prior to the approximate time of the motion picture. The video training footage is real. And, it's simply amazing that many people are actually saved from some of those hopeless situations.I almost lost my life on several occasions while tending to routine duty. Had it not been for our CG training and attention to detail, both before and during our missions, I would not be writing this review today. I served in every location depicted in the film, including Alaska, which can indeed be a brutal environment. The major portion of my small boat duty happened in the Gulf of Mexico. As we used to say while on small boat duty, ""we are required to go out to sea, but we are not required to return."" On the other hand, none of us was given permission by our commanding officer or chief to get hurt of killed.I used to get somewhat miffed at the amount of publicity and attention that those in the aviation branches get over the much larger force of seagoing officers and enlisted sailors who take care of the daily drudgery and human drama that happens far too often while people are attempting to earn their living from the ever changing and unforgiving environment of the sea. But, the media likes that kind of high visual drama. The Officer of the Day won't spend a dime of the money it takes to fire up a sophisticated, multi-million dollar aircraft and risk a group of highly trained aviation personnel without some definite attainable mission. When things go wrong out there in the middle of nowhere, they can go wrong very fast. Many times a radio call to the USCG is all that stands between Davy Jones' locker and some more time spent on this earth with your family and friends. How much is it worth? Just ask any victim of circumstance who has spotted the red, white and blue stripes of a Coast Guard rescue. There are no words to describe it when a set of strong hands reaches for you and you hear those welcome words, ""I'm with the U. S. Coast Guard. I'm here to help you."" The relief is overwhelming.When USCG pilots and enlisted swimmers go to sea, they have only a very limited time to affect a rescue, usually governed by fuel, load, weather, and yes, sometimes even luck. The job they do out there is supposed to be mostly routine. But, when the pilot announces it's time to leave the scene, you leave the scene. There is no question. It's either that or the people in the aircraft face a high risk of death. Every move the crew makes is full of life and death decisions that will determine the fate of not only those they are rescuing, but the personnel on the aircraft as well. Just one small error is all it takes for everyone in an operation to have a very bad day. So, all Coast Guard training is intentionally difficult to account for those variables.This motion picture, ""The Defection of Simas Kudirka (1978)"" and a hand full of other films are a testament to the training, dedication to duty and the constant attention and work by the maintenance personnel that keep the helicopters, airplanes, small boats and cutters operating smoothly and safely to accomplish the over 200 mandated missions of the U. S. Coast Guard every hour of every day.",The Guardian

I was there for it until the end....I read online that the alternate ending completely changes the ending emotion of the movie. I really do wish my husband had known there was one with a different ending, because I most definitely would've preferred that one haha.

95,FlorianSchirner,Strong performances in a already known but entertaining format,8,3 April 2008,"Oh no, another military (sort of) based mentor-student movie....that were my thoughts at first. Then I watched it on recommendation of a good friend and movie buff. She was right...like many times. First I have to pull my hat off to every member of any coast guard unit on this planet (Mountain rescue and other similar groups too, of course). Finally your efforts were recognized and honoured with a realistic and noble movie. Yes, realistic. I know a bit about how German coast guard gets trained and works, and it is harder than military basic training. The director, set designers, cameramen, FX crews and all other worked hard to show the problems the rescue swimmers and aviation crews have to deal with on a daily basis. Though I would have liked to see other branches of the coastguard as well (rescue boats, s&r onshore etc.) i understand that the movie had to concentrate on the main characters.Now we come to the actors, well. If you read my other comments you realize that I am becoming a Costner supporter after a long time hating him (mostly because I was fed up with hearing about ""Dances with wolves"" all the time). This guy again delivers a strong, credible performance of a low-profile hero. He, as in most of his roles, is really down to earth and just like your next door neighbour. Having the ungrateful part to act opposite him is Ashton Kutcher....Ashton Kutcher? Isn't that the guy who moderated the series ""Punk'd""? Whose greatest media success was marrying Demi Moore? Yes, and he acts superbly here. It may be not rewarded with an Oscar, but I believe some of his scenes (the one where Costner confronts him with his past f.e.) are stronger than many Oscar nominated or rewarded actors. Both female roles could have been cut, especially Sela Ward's role. Though it is nice to give the main characters a background, both roles are shallow and not very deep.Summary: You may have seen this mentor type movies all over and over, but name me a movie today with a fresh idea. At least it is not a really bad remake of a classic like Flight of the Phoenix or the Poseidon movie. I liked this movie a lot. Only points I have to criticize are the female roles and some (only a few) very cheesy lines. All in all, the movie is worth to have the Coast guard logo in it.",The Guardian
96,mcw2112,Cliché' ridden but still not bad...,6,9 August 2009,"The Guardian is a formulaic film, make no mistake about, but does that mean that it has to be bad? In a word, no. Kevin Costner plays Ben Randall, a salty, gruff and fiercely determined Coast Guard rescue swimmer that is getting a little long in the tooth, but is still at the top of his game. He lives and works out of Kodiak, Alaska, and has the sea coursing through his veins. He lives and breathes his work but is unable to split his devotion between 'the job' and his marriage to his wife, Helen (Sela Ward). Just as his marriage falls apart, his rescue chopper goes down and he ends up being the sole survivor of the crash. After this horrendous bout of bad luck, Ben is shipped down South to the Coast Guard's ""A"" School in Louisiana, where he will teach the best of the best Coast Guard swimmers the tricks of the trade. Randall holds all of the Coast Guard's swimming records and is practically a legend in the service. He is a no-nonsense, stern taskmaster, even pushing the limits of a few of his own instructors. He is extremely hard on his students and will send an inadequate applicant packing, without so much as a second thought. He knows what it takes to remain calm in the most perilous situations and he will either break the cadets or make them into successful rescue swimmers. It takes nerves of steel to jump out of a perfectly good helicopter into high, choppy seas, and then rescue some hapless yacht owner. You have to know that you have that special something before you make that plunge.Enter our cocksure, brazen wunderkind, Jake Fischer, played by Ashton Kutcher. He boldly takes on and exceeds at all of the instructors challenges and seems destined to break some of Randall's old records - maybe all of them. Kutcher manages a modicum of intensity, and looks plenty fit enough to handle the physical aspects of the job, but his character,Fish (he's aptly nicknamed), can't seem to please Senior Chief Randall, no matter how hard he tries. Jake has the obligatory romance with the obligatory local girl, but at least it wasn't too overdone or over-serious.The story is pretty boilerplate stuff, and the characters are of the type that we've all seen before, but it was none-the-less done well. Kevin Costner plays Ben Randall as a highly competent man that truly wishes that he could do 'life' as well as does 'work'. He has a trunk load of regrets that he carries squarely on his shoulders, but he reckons that he can at least do some good - professionally speaking. Ashton Kutcher plays Fischer as a guy with a lot to prove, but he, like Randall, has some psychological baggage that he's toting around. Baggage that he just can't quite sort out. The two men have the usual instructor/instructee battle of wits and determination, and life lessons are traded back and forth, to the eventual benefit of all involved, for the most part. Randall runs Fish ragged and then he runs him ragged again. Fish takes it all and asks for more. In the end, both men have earned each others respect. Again, it is an all-too-familiar story, but what the hell, it's still fun to watch if it's done properly.After graduation, Fish is, of course, assigned to Kodiak and he soon teams up with his former instructor to jump out of helicopters in the icy seas around Alaska. After a harrowing rescue of two guys in kayaks that nearly goes wrong, Ben decides to hang up his swim fins and call it a day. He froze in a critical situation and that just won't do. He is a man that has been beaten by the sea and longs to make peace with his estranged wife - and himself. The ending too, is very much boilerplate, but suffice it to say that Ben is called upon after retiring to help out in a desperate situation. We see it coming but are compelled to go along anyway.To tell the story of Coast Guard rescue swimmers and the amazing chopper pilots that work with them, it is necessary, mostly through CGI, to show just how dangerous the ocean can be. The landscape that the rescue swimmer works in, is one of a see-sawing indigo blue monster; giant swells and freezing temperatures and God-only-knows what lurking beneath it all. These people work in bad visibility, high seas, violent storms and typhoon conditions. Director Andrew Davis knows how to do 'BIG' and here it is imperative to show just how BIG and scary the ocean can be when it's at it's worst. We get a real sense of just how brave these servicemen and women are and the director went to great lengths to make it realistic. Where the story lacks in originality, it makes up for it in honoring the daring and selfless acts of the Coast Guard rescue teams. Check your cliché' monitor at the door and enjoy it for what it is.

99,flakcfan,Emotional,8,8 October 2006,"""The Guardian"" is a very good movie, one that will stay with you long after you have left the theater. At its heart, the film is about emotional journeys undertaken by its lead characters. The action sequences are exciting, but it's the character development that makes this movie. This is one of the very best roles of Kevin Costner's career (and he's had a lot of great ones), and you feel every up and down his character, Ben Randall, goes through. Jake Fischer is probably the most normal character Ashton Kutcher has ever played, and he does so nicely. He works well with Costner and with Melissa Sagemiller, who plays the woman Jake wants to woo. Some critics have carped about the length of the movie, but I disagree. I think it is well-paced, with good detail about what Coast Guard recruits go through. Some edits suggest that valuable parts of the story were left on the cutting-room floor, and there are other characters I would like to have seen more of.

This will make your mind do a back flip and want to hug him. Costner's character's love and devotion for his work and his crew, made this movie what it is. He would not stop fighting, and he would try his hardest.The one thing I love about watching movies, especially in the theatre, is that it brings you into it. Everything around you isn't there and it's like your watching them from within. The Guardian made you feel that even more. The Guardian made you feel sympathy, and the love of friendship, and the temperature of that ice cold tub, and the feeling of the weight of the world. It was a bit long, but it was worth it! Great direction, great writing. Camera work was excellent. They really got in your face to capture all of the emotion. Props, guys! Good luck at the box office , I'm recommending it to everyone I meet.8/10 stars",The Guardian
103,dicksosa,The legend of the man in the sea,7,18 March 2010,"Casting Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher in the same film easily could scream major flop, however this movie is actually rather engaging. Kevin does an excellent job of portraying Ben Randall a US Coast Guard rescue swimmer who on a rescue has a shocking accident that leaves him in a mental state of disarray.Ben is then sent to teach new recruit rescue swimmers how to save lives. As the expert enters the classroom we witness the clash of power as the previously taught theory mixes the real world application that Ben brings with him.Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher) is of course the star swimmer turned rescue swimmer fresh fish who may just be there to break records. Ashton does a surprisingly well played performance in this film. His character has a very serious internal struggle and Ashton portrays the emotional aspects very well, dismissing the type cast role as a goofy funny guy that is usually reserved for his acting ability. Jake's constant struggle and drive to be the best connects to the audience and we get to really root for the guy.The story touches on some personal hardships that many people face in their lives and it does well to not try and solve them in a two hour time span, but rather lets them play out.There are some scenes that do drag a little and with any film with montages there can be some scenes that drag or become repetitive. How many times can I watch them swim back and forth already. That said the story does flow along at a good pace for most of the film although at times it does have a bit of a jerky pacing with parts being very rapid and then very slow.The only other draw back is that ending is the atypical typical ending in that what you have expected to happen happens and then what you didn't expect to have happen happens. It's like they couldn't decided if they really wanted to not have the happy ending or have the happy ending.Although the film has some minor flaws it's a well entertaining look at a profession and position that most individuals would never even think about. Rescue workers risk their lives tremendously to save people every day and even each other. It's good to have a film that pays tribute to that and it's great that this film is a good one.",The Guardian
104,Youngbuck11,A great film...,6,15 October 2006,"This is a beautiful film that, I think, deserves a a better rating than 6.5. I think it at least deserves 7.5 if not higher. This was a great film.That isn't to say it didn't have draw backs. It's the rather common tear-jerker-style film where the main character dies to save his friend in the end. But it was told in a fresh way.It was also fairly long, which isn't so bad. I mean, it wasn't hard to get through the extra time. I just think they could've cut out a few scenes to make it a little less dragging.At the beginning, the CGI looked a little fake. The ship being tossed around in the water looked a little fake in that scene. But other than that, it had fairly realistic CGI in it.The love story behind this is nicely done...though a little cliché, when you think about it.All-in-all, it was an above average film that really honored the Coast Guard and shows you exactly what those guys go through.As I said, good film. But I doubt it'll be remembered. But what the heck, I might just pick it up on DVD when it comes out...maybe.-Chris",The Guardian
105,geebeegb1,Familiar story but still great.,9,17 September 2006,"I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie showing as a sneak preview in my local theater.We have all seen this plot line before (Top Gun, GI Jane, An Officer and a Gentleman) but a good script still works. This story is basically about the training of a Coast Guard rescue team with a couple of side story lines. Kevin Costner plays a highly successful rescue team leader, Ben Randall, who is forced into heading the training team after a tough mission. The movie takes us through the rigors of the training process and the personal stories of both the Costner character and that of Jake Fischer, played by Ashton Kutcher. I am happy to say that Ashton is great in this part.There are no great surprises in this movie and you will probably realize what is coming long before it arrives. However, the use of humor, the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching Ben Randall ""do his own thing as a trainer"", kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained. I really enjoy watching a movie that makes the entire audience laugh out loud, gasp here and there, and clap at the end as a tribute to the movie.We all had a good time (despite a couple of tough moments in the movie)and, I think, you will too.",The Guardian
106,ciribiribin,Ashton Kutcher's breakout role as the hero of his generation,1,31 May 2007,"The Guardian is a stinker. Sorry. Maybe I shouldn't have watched it with my wife. After the first half hour, which could have passed for a physical education instructional video, she was after me to turn it off. I did.Another problem was I watched the DVD the night after I watched Michael Douglas in the Sentinel. Another over-the-hill Hollywood macho man trying to sell us on the idea he's still got what it takes.Kevin Costner looks and acts like a golf hustler-clubhouse rat. No way do I believe he's a member of the Coast Guard's most elite water rescue team. Of course, his superiors don't believe it either, so they offer him a choice to either retire or teach younger guys how it's supposed to be done. Considering the group of pathetic, new-age recruits he has to work with, good luck Kevin.From there the story is a rehash of every young-boys-become-men military plot line you've ever seen, from Flyboys to Officer and a Gentleman to Top Gun. Of course, mentioning The Guardian in the same breath with these film classics is a travesty.Just as the story is predictable and hackneyed, so are the characters. This thing must have been written by a committee of high schoolers. Ashton Kutcher was laughable trying to measure up to Tom Cruise's prototypical wise-guy hero. Hoo Rah!!! Give me a break. How can anyone watch such garbage with a straight face.One star because Sela Ward was in it, even though her role was about as meaty as a tofu burger.",The Guardian
107,danahughes,Kostner and Kutcher's best ever,10,7 January 2007,"This story gripped my heart. It gave me a better understanding of the Coast Guard in a way that I would never experience except by first hand. It told a life and death storyline that no other movie has ever done. I'm a girl and not really into military type movies, but this is the best military type movie I have ever seen. This is Oscar worthy material. The acting was superb. The characters were complex and interesting. The brotherhood, the obsession of saving lives, the struggle of life, its all here.. Its one of those movies that you leave the theater with a feeling that you have witnessed something great. Thanks to the producers for giving me that feeling. I've seen 90% of Kostners movies and this is him at his finest. Ashton Kutcher was brilliant and was a perfect 'son' model and didn't upstage or take anything away from the lead role with his performance, yet his performance was superbly acted. This movie made this 30something soccer mom want to join the coast guard. This is a must see!",The Guardian
108,AutoXFan22,"Excellent story, fitting tribute",9,30 September 2006,"I put in a 10 vote for this, because it definitely impressed me. With the exception of a few small negative details, this movie was top-notch. Casting was excellent, the story was written very well, and I was personally very drawn to the realism of the characters presented. Fitting tribute to those unsung heroes of the Coast Guard Air Stations.OK, so going into the little negative details first, as I'm sure most want to hear the negatives first. The side story about Ben Randall and his wife is a little too drawn out. It fit, but was hammered in a little too hard for my taste. Another small detail, not sure if anyone would notice it, but when Jake Fischer meets his young lady friend, she never gives him a name. But somewhere in the course of some random date at the local Coast Guard bar, he suddenly uses it. Strange. Finally, my most fitting gripe. As far as I know, from speaking with Coast Guard recruiters and officers when I tried to apply into OCS, the average Coast Guard A-School instructor is not going to step on your head when you're about to get out of the pool after an hour-long treading exercise. Far as I know, training course instructors and drill sergeants aren't allowed to touch trainees in any way. But oh well, it's Hollywood. I guess that little bit of flair has to be put in, otherwise people won't see the movie.As for the positives, too many to mention. This was just a real good example of a worthy Hollywood product. Very believable, well-written, well-casted, this is the kind of movie that we should be seeing more often. Anyway, go see this movie, it will not disappoint.",The Guardian
109,valid908,I want this movie's DOR!,1,25 June 2007,"OK first i want to say that one of my favorite movies of all time was ""Officer and a Gentlemen"". That being said, I had no clue before watching this on demand what kind of movie I was in for meaning I had no preconceived notions about it.The fact that AOAAG is one of my all time favorite films probably didn't help me in liking this movie. It's like having Sushi at an expensive restaurant and then having sushi at say ""71l"". Absolutely no comparison...The Guardian rips off OAAG so much that you wonder how they didn't get fined for plagiarism. We start out with Ashton's character who is the ""know it all"" that does everything so well and it all comes easily to him (all the tests, etc). Remember Gere and his going through the first running test/obstacle course and Foley saying, ""Not bad for a ""beginner"". This is the same where we see Ashton's character breaking all the records and doing everything so easily.Then we see the other student who has of course the one part where he can't seem to get through (the breaking of the guy's hold under water). So of course Mr. Zack Mayo rip-off comes to the rescue and basically does the ""you walk that wall"" sequence but in a jail cell this time.Then there is also the cutesy nicknames that the instructor gives the conceited braggy pants which is ""mayonnaise"" in the original and ""goldfish"" in the ripoff.Then we get the love scenario with the local girl that is supposed to stay ""casual"" and yata yata...""we'll just have a good time"" thing. Although without the obvious chemistry that Gere and Winger had. In the original you actually care about them and what happens to their relationship but in this one you barely even notice what is going on between them and really don't care.The biggest rip-off sequence comes in the pool where we see Costner spraying water (yes that's right water) at Ashton's character and demanding his ""DOR"". Omg...for a second I thought they had actually inserted a scene from OAAG in there. Totally an obvious blatant ripoff. (What were the director and writers thinking?!). I'm a screenwriter and I'm happy that people are so void of ideas these days that they have to steal a classic movie's plot. Makes it easier for me to sell a script! :) And of course we couldn't have them forget to rip off a local watering hole bar scene where Ashton gets in a fight except that they have Costner come back and wack the guy which of course Gere didn't need because he wasn't a wimp and a half like Ashton...The only original part of the movie was the ending where Costner sacrifices his life for Ashton's but then we see such a ridiculous goofy ending with Ashton's character smiling and basically inferring that Costner is some ""angel"" still down in the ocean saving people. I guess we can see why they stuck mainly to ripping off an Officer and a Gentlemen! If you haven't seen OAAG then maybe you'd think this movie was good. Apparently so due to many of the ""great movie"" comments. But to a die-hard film lover like me, I'm not easily fooled...",The Guardian
110,Pgoel,One of Costner's best and shows Kutcher's potential,10,23 October 2006,"I went into this movie with mixed feelings. It had great trailers and the storyline sounded interesting. But I was worried about Ashton Kutcher's presence in the movie. Yet, this new actors acts relatively well. The greatest selling point of this movie is the chemistry between Kutcher and Costner. The veteran actor's acting talents cover up Kutcher's minor gaffes.Through this movie, I could predict what would happen.... until the very end. The twist at the end of the movie makes the movie worth seeing. Yet though this movie is mostly predictable, it is worth a see. It is entertaining and uplifting. The story is Randall (Costner) is a seasoned rescue swimmer with the US Coast guard. He is respected and a legend. Yet, he looses his team. In the aftermath of this his captain sends him to teach the new generation to recuperate. There he meets Fischer (Kutcher), a smart aleck who is for some unfathomable reason determined to succeed and become a rescue swimmer. Randall and Fischer are initially at odds as Randall wants to make committed dedicated team players who are willing to sacrifice their life and he does not feel Fischer fits into that model. Fischer, on the other hand, sees Randall as a washed up former legend who is just penalizing him for being better then Randall. It takes an unexpected act of kindness from Randall to Fischer and a phone call to Randall to turn this enmity into an endearing friendship/mentorship. The fact that this relationship is on the boundary makes it less clichéd and more respectable.Well worth a watch.",The Guardian
111,tom_dimaggio,Excellent movie..... one of last years best.,8,1 January 2007,"When I saw the trailer of the movie a few month back I knew that I wanted to see the movie for different personal reasons. I wasn't sure if it would live up to my expectations, but it did. And they are set very high for this kind of movie.Most of the characters are great. The story runs mainly around Kostner and Kutcher but gives enough information about the supporting roles for them to be interesting. Not too much time spend there as it wouldn't serve the story but just enough.Kostner and Kutcher are excellent in this movie.The story in itself has several clichés and in some places is predictable but other than that it's a great movie that I feel makes honor to all the people working in this kind of environment.Definitely a movie to be seen",The Guardian
112,aprilindeecee,"Paean to Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers does some things magnificently, but spends a lot of time doing others terribly",5,26 March 2007,"""...so others may live."" This slogan of the Coast Guard Academy particularly applies to its rescue swimmers. Kevin Costner stars as a veteran rescue swimmer beyond his prime who is ordered to take over an instruction cycle at the Coast Guard's Rescue Swimmer Training School. He delineates his character superbly for us as a true rescue artist who sacrifices everything else meaningful in life for his craft. From opening until closing, this movie electrifies us with its rescue sequences. Andy Davis, of Fugitive and Steven Segal movie fame certainly knows how to direct action sequences, but these are significant achievements even for him. The integration of stunt work, special effects, acting, and computer graphics is spellbinding. As Jake Fischer, the brash young Costner want-to-be (think Richard Gere in an Officer and a Gentleman), Ashton Kutscher gives his best performance-to-date -- and then some (otherwise I would be damming with faint praise). Although not in Costner's league nor as good as the aforementioned Gere or Cuba Gooding Jr. in the superb ""Men of Honor"", Kutscher blends the texts and the subtexts of his fairly complex character with aplomb in all his scenes with his male characters. (In dealing with women, he's still a squishy jerk even when his character had supposedly transcended beyond that -- but that's a very minor part of the movie and his character so I wouldn't hold it against Kutscher too much.) And as a woman, I must say that his male charms are on display in a quite attractive way. That's all the good news.To say that Writer Ron Brinkerhoff's dialog is pedestrian does jaywalkers a serious disservice! Costner and Kutscher are able to supply the clichés with such subtext that the lines seem to serve their characters well. In their all-too-limited roles as Costner's bosses at the Academy and in action in Alaska respectively, veterans John Heard and Clancy Brown are able to pull off similar feats. No one else can.In particular, the women are hung out to try here. The well-worn and meaningless clichés spouting from the mouths of such seasoned professionals as Sela Ward and Bonnie Bramlett are embarrassing and the actresses try so hard to do what they can with so little, it's embarrassing. Watching Melissa Sagemiller and Shelby Fenner having their more pedestrian talents overwhelmed by such inane dialog is even more painful. Fenner appears to start off playing a Lisa-Eilbacher-type character (another Office & Gentleman reference), then promptly disappears and doesn't even appear at graduation and we don't know why.And, it's not just the women. Brian Geraghty (much better in Jarhead) is the only other actor for whom an actual character is written. Unlike the others I mentioned, however, his uninspired acting does little to capitalize on the opportunity given him. In contrast, poor Dule Hill (magnificent as Charlie Young on the West Wing and pretty good on Psych) goes through the entire movie being seen but not heard. Why bother signing talent like that if you refuse to use it? After graduation, the movie meanders at a snail's pace taking unbearably long to set up its conclusion. That said, wait for it even if you have to fast-forward past a few chapter stops. The last sequence is worth waiting for. And the postscripts probably constitute the best dialog in the entire movie.So, since the Guardian is half terrific and half terrible, I wind up giving it 5 out of 10. If you are an action fan, add two points. If you have no use for action and hate Costner, don't bother.",The Guardian
113,Lathe_of_Heaven,Ehhhhhh...,5,27 February 2007,"Okay, I'm REALLY being generous giving it a '5'... The reason being is that I just sat through about 3/4 of it and finally gave up and turned it off. I guess that shows how totally enthralled I was with the story : ) Granted, I'm not much a straight 'Adventure' guy, but I DO VERY MUCH enjoy films like 'AN OFFICER AND A GENTELMAN', 'A SOLDIER'S STORY', ETC.Don't get me wrong, it is NOT a terrible film by any means, but C'MON!!!!!! Could the script and direction have been ANY more bland, banal, semi-clichéd and for the most part, uninspiring. Well, not COMPLETELY... I guess there WERE some moments in it that were very moving, but based mainly on the rather surprisingly good job that Ashton did (I'm NOT really a fan of his, but I do think that he actually was ACTING pretty decently here compared to his earlier stuff) I didn't buy Costner's role AT ALL, not for a moment; he came across easily as the WEAKEST military type instructor in ANY related type film in existence. I think that maybe that is what hurt this film the most.YES, the rescue scenes were okay, but to me anyway everything just came across as very mainstream, overused formula with almost no new angles or at least inspiring writing and direction. Maybe if someone like Ridley Scott was directing or someone of his caliber perhaps (take 'G.I. Jane' for example... Now THAT kicked some serious @ss!!!)I mean, COME ON...!!! Okay, the guys are treading water in the pool; the guys are swimming underwater pushing bricks across the bottom of the pool. The guys are (sort of) doing push-ups... Whoa, I'm getting pretty worked up here... *snore...I don't know, but it all came off as rather tepid to me; I appreciate the nice angle honoring the Coast Guard which is of course greatly deserved.

I would have given this movie an 8 had it been someone else who didn't remind me of his goofy characters on TV shows he's been on.Kostner gives the movie credibility, plays his role well.I have typically enjoyed almost every movie I've seen that contained his presence.

116,ronaldsteele-54467,Almost perfect,9,25 June 2021,"I gotta admit I wasn't too surprised that this was a good movie given that Kevin Costner was in it. A strong cast on top of it and a good back story to a few of it main characters. Ashton Kutcher however really amazed me with his over the top performance. With Neal McDonough, Clancy Brown, John Heard, Brian Geraghty, Sela Ward, of course Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher... how can this movie fail. The story was very tight, direction was perfect and the chemistry between all was good but I thought that what was missing was a technical thing. Casting Ashton Kutcher was the thing I thought was a risk. I'm not a big fan of his but I gave him credit where credit was due. I think a stronger actor could have made the part of Fischer more believable. Now Kutcher like Tom Cruise needs a Hollywood heavyweight to shine, I've seen his movie's and he cannot carry one. However he held his own against some of the biggest name's in Hollywood so I gave him credit for his performance.Now the movie comes off like a ""Top Gun"" of the sea/ocean with touches of ""An Officer And A Gentleman"" thrown in. Ashton Kutcher plays Jake Fischer, a recent high school graduate who joins the Coast Guard as a attempt to escape a recent tragic past. Kevin Costner plays Ben Randall a highly decorated rescue swimmer of the USCG (United States Coast Guard) who is assigned to train new recruit's after a tragic accident. Fischer is more into being the best no matter the price. His only goal is to hide his past and prove himself but a high school accident holds him back.Now the movie itself seems to move at a decent pace and I see it more as a retelling of. ""An Officer And A Gentleman"" but can it hold up. To me yes it does, it doesn't get too in your face or stray too far off course. Costner's performance totally holds the movie together and doesn't steal the scenes from the others nor from becoming just another Costner vehicle. I think Ashton Kutcher's character could have been given to a better actor but he does stand on his own. With a strong supporting cast this movie delivers. Only problem is it doesn't know when to end. It basically has two endings and that alone keeps it from earning a perfect 10.",The Guardian
117,ballplayer270000,Post Water World....................,10,23 December 2008,"If you see names like Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher on Movie credits, many people may write off the film because of them for the best or the worst. Kevin Costner has been doing just tremendous jobs to reinventing his career for last few years in such movies as Upside of Anger, Rumor Has It, and Open Range by carefully choosing well written and developed roles and he became very mature and smart actor. I always thought he was amazing actor and Director but just because of his huge success in 80's, he became a victim of his own success (Water world, Postman, Wyatt Earp that I personally adore those films) Kevin Costner plays USCG rescue swimmer turns into a teacher after he lost his team in rescue mission, and Ashton Kutcher is for his student. I really impressed by the way movie portraits instructor student relationships and training. Sure it has been done so many films, but Kevin Costner has been a master of playing someone's mentor as we all have seen in Bull Durham (He played veteran catcher who mature the rookie pitcher played by Tim Robins. How about Frank Farmer who is trained/disciplined ex-secret service agent) In away, he has been playing this type of character through his career, but it is just getting better and better with his age. Ashton Kutcher's character, the hot shot high school swimming champ requires a strong cockiness, and he perfectly delivered it. Some magazine ripped this film as G.I. Jane meets Perfect Storm. Yes, It has been done in G.I. Jane, Officer and Gentleman. Sure CGI has been done in Perfect Storm, but no one can take well written characters and great performances by both Kevin Costner and Ashton Catcher away from this film. Ironically, the movie title The Guardian didn't really click me prior to see this movie, but after the ending, awwwwwwwww, I got it........So do not let name of Costner and Kutcher fool you.

Will the script center on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? How about Fischer and Thomas? In the end, no real front story ever develops and the characters themselves are artificially propped up by monologues from third parties. The singer explains Randall, Randall explains Fischer, on and on. Finally, long after you don't care anymore, you will learn something about the script meetings.

The moment I saw the preview, I was intrigued. And happily, the movie was leaps higher in plot and message than I was expecting.Ben Randall (Kevin Costner) is a Coast Guard rescue swimmer. Tragically, his closest friend dies during a fiery explosion in the midst of a rescue. Ben is an emotional wreck and is stricken with guilt. His wife is no longer feeling loved or prioritized, thus his marriage is also falling apart at the seams. His commander sees how hard it has been on Ben and notices that Ben is past his prime in comparison to the rookies and other swimmers. He recommends a decent option for Ben - he could go train future rescue swimmers at an ""A"" school. Reluctantly, Ben agrees.Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher) is a former high school swim champ with an ego the size of planet Earth and a hidden past. He is determined to break every single swimming record held by previous rescue swimmers. Ben is annoyed by Jake at first, but soon realizes he has the most potential of the group.An emotional series of events make this movie an excellent portrayal of a group of people who I was hardly aware of prior to seeing the film. The Coast Guard rescue swimmers are people who risk their lives everyday just to save even one life. Lives beside, they also sacrifice much else - high salaries, family time, and living at home. Kutcher gives a great performance as the boy who essentially ""grows up"" when he learns the reality of the rescue swimming program. Costner also does wonderfully. As mentioned, I'm no action(ish) movie buff, but this one sure did seem like a winner to me.",The Guardian

The movie has got everything, suspense,drama, romance, action and caters for everyone. I particularly liked how we get to see all the complex training that these swimmers have to go through to be able to save our lives! Kevin Costner is great in this movie as a lead rescue swimmer, dealing with a tragedy and then becoming a leader for the next generation. It was also good too see Kutcher in another serious role and I think that this genre does suit him more than comedy. A great tribute to all the men and women of the coast guard!",The Guardian

The plot was completely unoriginal (I could go on and on about similar film plots but I won't), the script was cringe worthy cheesy and the acting...oh the acting...so bad that it made Showgirls seem worthy of an Oscar! Now overall I would say that the first half of the film was tolerable...it was slightly humorous, very easy watching. It started to get really bad when you realized that what you thought was the end of the film really only marked the half way point (this film is around 2 1/2 hours long but it seems like 10!). The second half just got worse and worse as time ticked on. I guess the big appeal was supposed to be the rescue scenes which looked like scenes that were literally clipped out of 'A Perfect Storm' but with false emotion and text book conflicts.Predictability was also a factor in my scoring. I knew nothing more of this film before I watched it other than it starred Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner (what has happened to him!?)yet I was able to spell out the entire plot including the ending after seeing the first 5 minutes.I'd watch it only b/c it's like a car crash...it's so bad but you can't tear your eyes away.",The Guardian
126,Chasuk,Predictable Cheese,1,7 April 2007,"I've seen worse movies this year, but not many. One, actually: Rumor Has It, which also starred Kevin Costner. When I can guess how a movie will end before it begins (except films such as Titanic or The Diary of Anne Frank), I consider it a wasted evening. This movie was such predictable cheese that I literally groaned aloud.The movie can be summed up thusly: young pup learns lessons from old dog. Old dog dies. Boring. Not really even competently acted, unless one gives pity points to Ashton Kutcher. Anyone who has seen Terminator 2 knows how this film ended, but Terminator 2 was more emotional. The tacked on ghostly fisherman was such schmaltz that I felt lobotomized.",The Guardian
127,wndrmdgt,Great story but Hollywood values,7,4 March 2007,"Very entertaining. Good story about a great subject. Other reviews tell enough about the story, and based on my reviews I agree with the good reviews. It was even an okay movie despite Kevin Costner, who in my opinion has never made a good movie that wasn't about baseball. Even relatively family friendly, at least with the violence.***SLIGHT SPOILER IN HERE*** However, it's Hollywood, so the male and female leads MUST sleep together. They don't show anything, but it's obvious. Married couples are either divorcing or one is dead. And the only brief play to romantic love merely implies that a character wants to make their relationship somewhat more serious (great line, so I don't want to ruin it). ***END SPOILER***But to end on a positive note: The major characters do support each other, the non-sex related values are outstanding (making me explain the concepts of honor and duty to those I saw the movie with), and the rescue scenes are quite realistic.",The Guardian
128,letshaveagoodtm,I wanted to share some real world experience,6,8 January 2016,"First, I spent over 3 years at the busiest Search and Rescue station in the Coast Guard, NAS Reserve New Orleans. Keven Costner played a Master Chief on SAR missions, that virtually never happens. The chiefs went home at 4:00 and the grunts took over. And during the day the ready crew for SAR missions was always E-6 and below.Sometimes the senior officers went on SAR missions as pilots but never senior chiefs. I was an E-6 when I got out after logging over 1000 hours as a crewman. I will agree with others unless things have changed there was never any hurah just hard work and lots of it. We often worked 36 hours straight and put peoples lives at risk because of absolute fatigue! I was involved in multiple life saving missions as well as missions to pick up those that did not survive.It was an amazing experience but I also no longer miss wondering if I will live or die during a mission. I sent a MayDay and also flew on another mission that declared and emergency. In the 4 months before I got out 3 helos crashed and there was one survivor out of all the crashes, 11 men giving their lives. Also, there was never any melodrama when we were making life and death decision, we fully understood our responsibilities and it was always very professional when we were forced to make those decisions!FYI if you watched the movie my number was about 6 or 7, it was a hard number to think about and decide. But that was in about 3 years and 3 months.",The Guardian
129,pbayle3,Decent Military Bildungsfilm,7,21 March 2010,"This is a flawed but mostly enjoyable movie. It gives a believable account of the training that goes into making a crack rescue swimmer. Costner and Kutcher make an engaging team (Kutcher is really very good), and the rescue sequences are genuinely suspenseful. I usually don't like uplift movies or movies like Top Gun, where a rebellious but gifted young man learns to straighten up and fly (or swim) right. This was far better than I expected.There are some flaws, however. The movie is too long, because it has to juggle among the relationship between Randall and his wife, exhaustively detailed training sequences, the relationship between Fischer and his new girlfriend, a third character who is desperate to succeed after having washed out three times before (pun only partly intended) and two rescue scenes at the end. The romantic episode between Fischer and his new girlfriend is not fully realized--there is not much chemistry between Kutcher's character and the girlfriend, who is not very alluring. The ending is not believable because everyone forgets that Coast Guard swimmers are under a chain of command.If you can get past these problems, the movie is very much worth watching.",The Guardian
130,jind,a veteran coast guard helps to train future coast guards how to be professional coast guards,7,18 October 2006,"This is the latest entry from Kevin Costner and he has really managed to choose a good script. I must admit that when I first saw the movie poster for this back in August I wasn't quite sure what to expect. When I saw a preview for it I said to myself that it might be something worth checking out. When the movie was released my instinct told me when I had the time to go and see it, and, I am glad that I followed my instincts. This movie basically mangages to deliver what it promises to deliver. It comes across as ""young hotshot"" being shown the ropes by a ""true veteran"" but the movie itself is a real story as to what happens when two people who are really good at what they are doing ironically manage to bring out the ""best"" in one another. Ashton Kutcher shows up thinking that he is going to ""out do"" Kevin Costner with all of the awards that Costner has won, but, as the story goes on, the two of them both wind up learning that they are both pretty much""equal"" in terms of their abilities. Yes, there is also a ""nice love interest with a really pretty girl"" for Kutcher and they actually have some chemistry together. The movie also shows you some excellent examples of what ""coast guard training"" is all about and shows you how hard they all work. The training shows you how they are all taught to work together and be a true ""team"" and show one another ""courtesy and respect"". If you want a good movie to see in the theatres or eventually on rental, this is a good one.",The Guardian

He always manages to turn a simple emotion into a sweet,lovable and kind of stubborn and self-confident one. I personally don't like Kevin Costner but this movie showed me wrong. Maybe it was the awesome selection of actors put together in the same scene and acting so natural. The sacrifice these people make is pictured perfectly. It was more than i expected. I also liked the friendship perspective-not too close not always there for each other but still supporting and trusting. Most important it wasn't boring and filled with dull scenes of expressing love sorrow or sad music. Simple,classy and touching!",The Guardian

Seems like he makes movies specifically to be the center of attention. The characters are almost always the same ... the heroics, the flaws, the greatness, the fall, the redemption. Yup, within the 1st 5 minutes of the movie, we're all supposed to be in awe of his character, and it builds up more and more from there.And this time the story ... story? ... is just a collage of different movies. You don't need a spoiler; you've seen this movie several times, though it had different titles. You'll know what will happen way before it happens.

134,ltlrags,Rent something else,1,21 May 2007,"One good thing: Costner turns in a good performance. Everything else is so bad, that I feel compelled to write a review. Ashton Kutcher is abominable, except for the few moments when he gets to use his ""70's show"" humor, such as the scene where he apologizes to Costner. I don't usually comment on dialogue or critique a screenplay, but this is so overtly sophomoric that I wonder how the movie got made. When Costner addresses the A School recruits, he says he doesn't care where they come from or anything from their past; then he begins questioning them about where they came from and their past. There are several glaring moments like this when dialogue is immediately contradicted. I'm not sure what else Andrew Davis has directed, but by the looks of this, I would say it must be his first effort. What is the deal with the hand held camera footage of the training? If it was throughout the movie it would fit better, but it's only in one scene. Then there's a flashback of a scene we know nothing about. Was it a nightmare of something he fears? If so, it blends in with all the other flashbacks. As for the absolute worst scene, I couldn't choose between anything when Kutcher has an intense look on his face, or the final scene when Melissa Sagemiller has a totally unbelievable moment of surprise. The latter seemed like an outtake rather than a keeper.",The Guardian

I expected a very chorus verse chorus attempt at recognition for our much overlooked Coast Gaurds. To put it truthfully, I expected a Top Gun in water. However, this ended up surprising me. Considering I'm not a fan of Ashton, this type of film, or Kevin Costner's usual cocky flair and love of showing off his ass ... I would say I was unusually swept in. It was a very intense movie from start to finish. It was also extremely long yet never really had a moment of down time. I think it was obvious to put it together from various clues through out the movie what exactly would happen but, that didn't change the over all effect. I think it was a well acted role for Kevin Costner, Ashton wasn't that bad although he's a total dork, and I think a 6.5 is being pretty harsh. I expected at least an 7.5 or higher. I would recommend this to anyone. In fact, I have a few people I intend to recommend to see it.

Kevin Costner did a fine job and created an entirely believable character, but just got carried away in a bad plot twist or two.While some of the sea scenes were simply excellent and offered a solid experience, they were spliced in poorly because of questionable editing.This IS the sort of movie that is best in the theatre, but it's best to minimize the expense on this as it's not superior entertainment.Spoilers below.First scene, huge waves and rescue, but just 30 to 40 minutes away there were no waves and it's sunny!? Second ridiculous scene is the ""navy"" bar scene...the timeline is off and Kevin's tough-guy routine in the bar was a bit over the top. The ranking officer showed restraint here, but why not earlier when his crew started the fray?

138,hrwebb,Too Bad a Movie about the Other Service is a Cliché,4,22 September 2007,"I'll admit that I was entertained. The rescue scenes were realistic and intense. The story of the Coast Guard rescue swimmers is one that should be told and known, but the movie is one you have seen before.I can hear the ""one-line,"" the pitch: ""It's 'Top Gun' meets 'Officer and a Gentleman' with the competition to be the best--this time between the boot camp DI (""Master Chief"" in CG lingo) and the troubled recruit--and the bar fight--this time between the Navy and CG--and the boot camp girlfriend. It's the broken down and redeemed older mentor with the troubled and redeemed younger man and a buddy movie rolled together. It even featured the almost washout weekend with the recruit being hosed by the Master Chief.Disclaimer: I actually like a lot of Costner's movies, but this role suits his somewhat wooden style more than most. Ashton Kutcher is a bit old for the role of a just out of high school recruit. Sela Ward is pretty good as the estranged wife of the Master Chief, but her story line is not well developed. Neal McDonough (""Band of Brothers"") makes a stereotypical appearance as another of the Chiefs in basic.I hate to trash the writing, but this one is pretty lame, though I suppose it could have been anyone from studio execs to Costner himself that turned it into a 2 hour and 19 minute cliché.

GO SEE IT! I think the best thing about it is I saw it with my Dad, who spent 22 years in the Navy, and he really points out discrepancies in movies as far as strategy, weapons, etc... and this movie didn't warrant one, they really did their homework. I heard a lot of negative remarks about Ashton as far as his acting, some people think all he can do is be idiotically slapstick comedic. But the thing is, you have to be BRILLIANT to pull off someone as dumb as the character he played on That 70s show. He REALLY showed his stuff in this film. He was one of the most amazing runway models of his generation, he NEVER would have been able to make the jump from modeling to acting if he didn't have the chops, people think you can do whatever you want once you've made it, but he wouldn't GET a part alongside Kevin Costner if he couldn't step to the plate in a screen test.

140,Adamjammer,Not as bad as I expected,4,1 October 2006,"To begin with, I had fairly low expectations, so I was surprised when The Guardian wasn't as bad as I expected. Granted, it really wasn't great, but it could've been worse. I suppose I should be more specific, right?First off the length is one of its biggest flaws, you could easily chop off a good 45 minutes, make it closer to 1 1/2 hours and it wouldn't have suffered greatly. Secondly, I hardly exaggerate when I say they trot out nearly every single action movie cliché in the book, and I do mean nearly all of them. The fact that Costner plays an ""unconventional"" teacher who ""won't give up"" on Kutcher's character, and that they have more in common and learn to overcome their dislike of each other and in the end have a mutual respect, the way the events unfold and even the lines that are used to unfold them, it's one tired cliché after another. I know that it's hard to be original when most everything has been done, but unlike other action movies The Guardian doesn't bring anything new to the scene in presenting these clichés. Thirdly, maybe the most astounding fact is that despite its tedious length, the movie focuses nearly entirely on Costner and Kutcher. Of course this is the point of the movie, but its a shame to let the supporting cast go to such waste. Most of the other characters are kept out of the picture, popping up now and then to remind us that they exist and offer a one-liner or two, and the few we do meet (the girlfriend, the ex-wife, etc) are retreaded characters we've met in a thousand other action movies. I mean, I personally love Dule Hill and was psyched (no pun intended to those of you who catch it) when he surprisingly turns up as another student in the Coast Guard Academy. I was needless to say supremely disappointed when he had a grand total of 3 lines. But I digress, the point is that the movie takes so long and yet focuses on so little besides Costner and Kutcher. For the 219 minute price, I personally would expect a little supporting cast action. Alas, little was to be had.So, why wasn't it as bad as I thought it would be? Well for starters despite the fairly vapid characters nearly all the actors do a credible job with the little substance they have. Some are better than others, I've always liked Costner and he does a good job here, seeming to have the most fun with a rather flat character. Kutcher continues to underwhelm me but he shows some flashes of some decent acting chops. In addition, while they do use clichés up the whazoo, they're pulled off pretty well, even the final big scene (which I saw coming a mile away) was done surprisingly decently in my opinion, and it helped save the film. Visually it's a satisfying enough film, and there're even a few good one-liners stuck in the mediocre script. Overall, I'd say wait for a rental. It isn't great but as far as fairly mindless action flicks go, it's done well enough.",The Guardian
141,kc1177,A fast ride-had me holding my breath,7,27 January 2007,"This one had me on the edge of my seat, and in the underwater scenes, holding my breath. Good adventure story. For a fairly long movie there was no checking the watch to see how long I had sat watching-it definitely pulls you in and then pulls you along at a heady pace. Good plot line, though in a couple of places I caught myself thinking of other films (A Perfect Storm or Top Gun-at one point even A Message in a Bottle). It reminded me once again of why I always love Costner's movies despite the minor flaws they have. My only complaint is that while a fairly long movie it skimps a little bit on character development to get in all the action which leaves a few of the characters literally dropping off the grid. Maybe they tried to ice the cake a little too thinly, putting in too many people and not letting us get to know them. There were some interesting characters we didn't quite get to know well enough.

This movie is worth watch, imo. Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher both did well. Ashton obviously really wants to be taken seriously, wants to be thought of as someone other than Michael Kelso or the guy from 'Dude, Where's My Car?'. He's not amazing, but for a comedic actor trying dramas, he's pretty good. =] And Kevin Costner was also good. *shrug* This movie is like 2 1/2 hours long, but if you get into it like I did, it doesn't really seem like it.

After losing his team he takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes. The young troubled recruit is played by Kutcher. While his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt butter, he compliments Costner well. I never really understood Sela Ward as the neglected wife and felt she should of wanted Costner to quit out of concern for his safety as opposed to her selfish needs. But her presence on screen is a pleasure. The two unaccredited stars of this movie are the Coast Guard and the Sea. Both powerful forces which should not be taken for granted in real life or this movie.

Aston Kutcher is quite possibly the worst actor in the world. Move over Keanu! I am serious when I say there is nothing new that you have not seen a million times here. I'm not sure I was watching the same movie as other people. The only thing that was decent about this movie were some of the action scenes on the water.

It keeps things simple, and although the plot is a little predictable, you care, and thats the main thing, I have to say that without the strong script this could have fallen on its head, but its delivered with confidence throughout, and proves that even in 2007 you don't need a huge budget (Titanic - which apart from the effects, and the I WONT LET YOU GO sequence sucked, especially on repeat viewing, so forced and badly directed) to tell an emotional tale well. Very satisfying especially as it seems humble and seems to have been directed with real care for all those involved. Brill.

149,Pretty_houstongirl77,Outstanding conviction to its subject matter!,9,27 July 2021,"First, I have to say that I truly feel those who are giving this movie poor reviews based on the actors involved can't get past their own bias.Hollywood is infamous for type casting young (and older) trendy actors in the same role over and over so they can't delve into their talent enough to prove themselves.The Guardian doesn't typecast here! Ashton gets an opportunity to flex his wings and it's beautiful to watch. Even more impressive is the dedication he brought to this film by spending eight months training with actual Coast Guard instructors (prior to filming and further immersion in the world of a CG Rescue Swimmer) to the point that he could literally climb aboard a helicopter and be good to go in a real life rescue situation! (Check out the behind the scenes on disc).His character Jake initially seems to be the cocky glory hound. But what those who are griping that he's all arrogance and swagger aren't paying attention to are the more subtle nuances of the pain Fisher is concealing behind a thin sheen of bravado. Upon second and third glances through multiple parts of the film, we see the vulnerability peeking through the wall he's built around himself to keep anyone from looking too closely.He desperately does want to save lives (and not for the glory and spotlight), but he also has a genuine talent and a desire to put that talent to better use than a sports career.We get to see glimpses of his true motivations in the classroom scene watching genuine CG Training footage of injured victims being rescued because where his classmates are horrified by these shocking images (think Blood on the Highway driver's ed horrified) he's clearly deeply affected and is re-living his own personal nightmare.Kosner, as always, delivers his quiet and subtle every man to Senior Chief Randall who is dealing with his survivors guilt and a crumbling marriage.And to the naysayers complaining about clichés, guess what folks...this life is hard and being married to someone in a career field such as this is oftentimes anathema to a happily ever after kind of love story. Being a military spouse myself, I can tell you that it ain't all yellow ribbons and star spangled banners with red roses on the side. Take it from someone who's 1st wedding anniversary was relegated to a ""romantic dinner"" at IHOP because it fell on a Sunday in a small military town that shuts down at 6pm and we were stuck in town for a training exercise.I truly appreciate how much genuine Coast Guard involvement the producers and directors brought to the film, not only with their advisory staff but ultimately bringing in A School Instructors, Pilots, and Rescue Swimmers as on screen cast members who did what they do best, giving this film fantastic authenticity.And the fact that set construction began in New Orleans and had to be relocated due to Katrina was a serendipitous to say the least given how vital the CG was to the hurricane relief!The action scenes were extraordinary and well coordinated! (They should be considering how much influence from the real McCoy was available!)The supporting ensemble was excellent! The score was lovely! I give this a nine because while it's not an Oscar candidate, it deserves far more than a 6.9. This is an up close and personal look at an oft overlooked, undervalued, and under-celebrated branch of our military whose sole purpose is to save lives in the most deadly conditions outside of a war zone (and sometimes even IN a war zone)!It's certainly deserving of more than just a passing glance!",The Guardian

My wife was not convinced about the love story between Fischer and the girl, but that was not really central to the movie.I was a little disappointed that the story didn't tie into a real-life rescue. In all, it was a good and entertaining story, nothing spectacular, but a respectable tribute to the U.S. Coast Guard.",The Guardian
152,Warbucks,Great Movie!,8,1 October 2006,"I heard good news about this movie from reviewers (not the critics) and I would have to say I agree. I thought the acting was very convincing and I was on pins and needles during the rescue scenes; it felt pretty real to me. The only logical flaw i saw was the last scene where they were hanging on a rope together. Why didn't the helicopter just drop down within 15-20 feet of the water and solve the problem?? Anyways, its a wonderful movie and it proved to me that I couldn't survive a day during all that training!!I think everyone will comment that they couldn't imagine Ashton Kutcher in a serious role before this movie...he does very well. I've always liked Kevin Costner in the neighbor-next-door type roles; usually his charisma gets him through movies but I felt his acting was some of his best work yet.",The Guardian
153,johnstoa,"loved this movie, great character development and special effects",10,7 October 2006,"the guardian was an excellent movie that had so much to offer. While it seemed kind of a mix of Top Gun and Backdraft it held its own by creating new plots and trials and truly touching characters....except for Ashton Kutchers girlfriend in the movie, she was clearly added in as an additive to give girls wanting romance in a more drama-action oriented movie. The cinematography was unique as it reminded me much of a real documentary filmed on coast guard training. It truly gave an accurate representation of what their lives are like and didn't Hollywood it up too much. This movie gives coast guards the respect they deserve for all they do and the tribute to Katrina at the end of the movie was truly touching as well.",The Guardian
154,Ilikebooks,This movie was dumb!,1,1 July 2007,"As a member of the armed forces (army). This movie sucked. I was more annoyed with ashton's character and the whole I'm a wounded soul that cosnter likes to do. I felt dumb for sitting through this trite piece of crap that made me want to rip my eyes out. I can't want for ashton to finally fade away and costner to find a new direction. Save your money and wait for this movie to be on the discount shelf in your local supermarket. BTW, the story line was incoherent! It didn't do any good for the Coast Guard too. It made the Navy look like jerks. I'm disappointed they did not bag on the air force. In short, save your money.",The Guardian
155,DavidInAustin,Excellent - Semper Paratus!,10,13 October 2006,"I have to agree with zzsilentbobzz's assessment of the movie. I am a former QM2 and served as a Search and Rescue and Law Enforcement LPO in Stations from Dutch HArbor to Key West (during the Mariel Boatlift in 1980) The few inconsistencies are the ones zzsilentbobzz already mentioned (read his comments too - another Coastie) and much of the content, look and feel of the film is EXTREMELY accurate, especially the ""A"" School and rescue scenes.It is also nice to FINALLY see a movie that honors, and just as important acknowledges, what is in peacetime and in war the most important service for the average American. Why is that so? Because our chief mission is to save lives and property, not destroy them. That is not to diminish our DOD associates at all - I always honor their courage and service and would not want their billets - but it IS to also honor the Coast Guard equally, something that has never been a priority in the United States, at least until someone needs us. The USCG has had an incredibly high per capita duty related fatality rate throughout its history, and as the oldest of the seagoing uniformed services has always had a unique, and uniquely dangerous, mission. ""So Others May Live"", the motto of the Rescue Swimmers in the movie, is actually the motto of all of us who served, and serve, in Search and Rescue (SAR) and Law Enforcement (LE) and of the many Coasties who have given their lives so that others might live.Semper Paratus - the USCG is Always Prepared!",The Guardian
156,slatoid,A Very Formulaic Plot,5,5 October 2006,"Variations of this have been done so many times in so many other movies, you will be predicting the story several scenes in advance. I could not help thinking of other movies while watching this one, and that can't be good. I mean, a movie is supposed to keep you enthralled with what is currently on the screen, right? During the film I was recalling movies like Top Gun and The Perfect Storm, just to name a couple.Also, Costner is, quite simply, a flat actor who is devoid of character. The only thing I've really liked him in was Bull Durham and he was just OK in Open Range. It's too much of a ""stretch"" for him to do anything other than a baseball player or a cowboy. The other actor who's name escapes me (you know the 25 yr-old who's married to 45 yr-old Demi Moore?), is nothing to write home about either.",The Guardian
157,dgo-2,Clint did it better.,6,20 October 2006,"This film is worth seeing, if only to learn about the important and heroic work done by the members of the United States Coast Guard. Other than that, this movie is ""every boot-camp movie you have ever seen"". There are striking similarities to Clint Eastwood's ""Heartbreak Ridge"", right down to the scene where the ""bar room mom"" of the base bar shows the feisty young buck the yellowed newspaper clipping of his drill instructor, and warns him he will never be half the man... (get the drift?) This film is far too long: they could have edited out about 20 minutes of Kevin Costner being ""pouty"". And the bottom line is, Clint Eastwood in his day was much better at this sort of thing than Kevin Costner.",The Guardian
158,neil-roach2,Awesome,10,6 January 2007,"Anything I say cannot do this movie justice. Kevin Costner has had some appalling movies in his time but this offering kept my wife and myself glued to the screen throughout. After watching this movie, I have a real respect for the coast guards throughout the world and the superb work they do and a sense of understanding of how they put their lives on the line each and every day to rescue others. Camera work was first class, characters portrayed excellently and a storyline that can leave you with a lump in your throat. Powerful performances from both Costner and Kutcher (whom i've never really liked until now) make this one movie not to be missed. Thank you Andrew Davies for a wonderful 136 minutes.",The Guardian
159,chiefehrman,The US Navy,9,23 February 2007,"I really loved the movie and it moved from the first few minutes. Being a Retired Navy Chief I have the utmost respect for the Coast Guard who for the most part are more sailors then most Navy ""sailors"". But, I would like to comment on the Navy scene. First off you would not find and 0-6 Navy Captain hanging with his crew in a bar like that, two you wouldn't be caught dead as an E-6 First Class in your dungaree's either (to work and back) and most import the two who started the fight ""thinly disguised"" Navy Chiefs would not start a fight with a two Junior sailors. Now when Senior Chief Randell came back he did what any good Chief would have done and I loved it. You just got to love Hollywood. I did Katrina/Rita as a Police Officer. I have worked with the Coast Guard and they earned the respect I have for them. I earned two Coast Guard Ribbons (Puerto Rico). Good Movie",The Guardian
160,xSoupyTwist,"Great, yet sad, movie...go see it! :]",8,12 March 2007,"Wow, i really liked this movie. I thought the romance part didn't have to be thrown in it was kind of awkward and didn't really fit in but oh well. the movie was pretty sad, specially near the end and bits and pieces here and there in the movie. i think it seemed pretty realistic and i'm going to get the DVD to see the process in which they filmed it i think Kevin Costner and Ashton kutcher portrayed their characters wonderfully and wow it's so weird seeing Ashton kutcher playing a serious character, but he did it well :]I guess though, the beginning training part is a little slow but i didn't really notice. i think you will be absorbed into the movie and the hours will pass before you know it...overall, the movie was great go see it XD",The Guardian
161,imcamel,Tired of critics...,10,2 October 2006,"I went and saw this movie yesterday and loved every minute of it. I am so sick of critics who refuse to appreciate anything Kevin Costner does. Apparently, he got on someone's blacklist and from here on out will never be appreciated again. The reason I go to the movies is for entertainment. The relationship between Costner's character and Ashton Kutcher's character was tremendous. I was at the edge of my seat for half the movie, and either laughing or crying the other half. This was without a doubt the best movie I have seen in a long time. It is one I am excited to recommend to others and I'm not ashamed to take younger nieces and nephews to go and see. Swearing, sex scenes and graphic violence is kept to a respectable level. Ignore the critics and treat yourself to an impressive, long, worth every penny movie. I was amazed by the acting performances of the entire cast!",The Guardian
162,ricca-1,Who Cares,2,19 January 2007,"Once again Mr. Costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary. Aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences, of which there are very few I just did not care about any of the characters. Most of us have ghosts in the closet, and Costner's character are realized early on, and then forgotten until much later, by which time I did not care. The character we should really care about is a very cocky, overconfident Ashton Kutcher. The problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet. His only obstacle appears to be winning over Costner. Finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker, Costner tells us all about Kutcher's ghosts. We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing. No magic here, it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in.",The Guardian
163,roylatham,Entertaining,7,27 March 2007,"As a former member of the US Navy I must admit that I started this movie with a tiny bit of lowered expectations... It turns out that I was pleasantly surprised. It certainly sheds a light on the USCG that many people fail to recognize as one of their primary responsibilities and presents them in a very positive manner.My only complaint about the movie was the overly dramatic scenes involving the CG Swimmers going into a ""squid"" bar. As a former Chief Petty Officer I was a bit offended by the fact that the two largest trouble makers were represented (by uniform insignia) as being US Navy Chief Petty Officers. This representation of senior enlisted personnel as being so shallow and eagerly willing to cause trouble reflects negatively upon the US Navy and personally offended me. It is one of the few scenes in the entire film that I wish had been approached differently.Other than that one issue I truly felt that this was an entertaining movie and would recommend it to anyone.",The Guardian
164,elliott_dyer,When is it going to stop?,3,19 December 2006,"I'm sick and tired of no talent and over-rated actors that receive quality roles and continue to believe their own hype. Ashton Kutcher is a horrible actor; granted, he had some pretty funny moments on That 70's Show, but in all actuality anybody can play an idiot. I know he is very attractive and that draws a huge female crowd, but he can't act to save his life. He is the poster-boy for exceptionally good-looking actors with no skill what-so-ever receiving exceptionally good roles. Any movie that he is in is going to be all about a studio receiving large sums of money; it is not going to be about great acting and making the film in question the best picture live up to it's full potential. This problem is plague to the movie industry and hopefully people will eventually start to look beyond pure good looks and begin to observe talent and skill. Another problem with this movie is that is full of military movie clichés; I liked it better when it was called An Officer and a Gentleman. This studio should be ashamed and Ashton should quit stealing good roles from quality actors.",The Guardian
165,rcdugan95,Good film.,7,17 June 2008,"The Guardian was a good film. When I saw the previews, I was thinking it looked kind of stupid. But I was surprised that Friday night when my friends pulled me into to going to see ""The Guardian"". Through the first 10 minutes I even thought it was going to be bad. Bzut as the movie progressed, I realized how good it was. Ashton Kutcher was the best person to play the role of Jake Fischer. Costner was good in this one, too. I enjoyed the 2 hours of this movie. As soon as I got home, I had to buy this one. My friends enoyed it, too. This was a good one, and when I bought it, I couldn;t stop watching it. ""The GUardian"", was a ood movie.",The Guardian
166,Jack_Bauer_CTU_FO,This movie is really good!,8,18 September 2006,"I saw this movie at a sneak preview in Chicago on Saturday and I must say it is really good! I'm not a die hard Kevin Costner fan and I think Ashton Kutcher is good, but wow! Ashton is really a fantastic dramatic actor (He was a huge surprise in Butterfly Effect for me). The movie is also very funny. Lots of sarcasm and one-liners. The audience actually applauded at the end. For a 2 hour movie, I can honestly say, you won't be looking at your watch wondering how much longer you have to sit there. I might even go see it again when it opens nationwide.If Ashton keeps picking movies like this, he'll be right up there with Tom Hanks, Mel, the other ""Tom"", & Brad, someday. Hopefully he can do it without going off the deep end with some of those guys.",The Guardian
167,movielover_311,wow,9,2 November 2006,"Wow. What an incredible film. This film is definitely one of Costner's best performances yet. I was asked to go by brother and I wasn't too happy because I didn't really want to see a film about the Coast Guard (nothing personal, I'm just not into military/war films) but he drug me there and I would definitely pay to see it again. From the opening scene to the closing credits I was captivated by the powerfulness of the acting and directing. I don't think I've ever seen a better Costner film and by the end I was so emotionally attached to the characters I felt as if we were related and if they got hurt or in trouble I physically felt worried. I have never been so attached to characters in a film and I think that all of the subplots of the film just make it that much better. Go see this film!",The Guardian
168,hoenija,The end was disappointing,7,18 October 2006,"This was a good movie overall, I didn't like the ending scene though. The circumstances during the ending scene were a bit absurd. There are many holes in plot of this scene. I feel the Chief's life could have been saved if portraying the real coastgaurd, their ethics would have prompted them to save everyone's life. I don't think the end was well written, leaves the audience with a lot of questions and steps around some obvious mistakes. But I do think that the movie does honor those who serve and protect us and sacrifice their own lives during duty. There is good character development and good performances by the actors.",The Guardian
169,msgirl,Excellent movie.,10,30 September 2006,"The movie was very good. I was in awe of of Kutcher! He was amazing! It wasn't difficult to separate him from the long time part in the 70's show. Not a boring moment & Kutcher played an awesome part. I hope to see him in more serious parts! Comedy, suspense and emotion..... I would watch it again. I heard the movie was all predictable & it was somewhat but still an unbelievable movie. I thought the movie also displayed some of Kutcher's real character as a very caring & a person with a lot of character. The brief love scenes were sweet but you could certainly tell his devotion lies with his wife who is very lucky. This is supposed to contain 10 lines but I think I have about summed it up without giving away the movie.",The Guardian
170,aadorn,as a coastie wife i was very satisfied,9,29 September 2006,"it's about time that a fabulous movie was made illustrating the lives and sacrifices made by the under-appreciated US Coast Guard. i loved this movie, it was well cast and well executed. it moved a tiny bit slow at times, but it did justice to the plot, it was funny and witty, and pulled many tears at the end. a must see for any military wife, especially those of us who have given up our dreams to follow our Coasties around the world.Ashton Kutcher does a fabulous job in not being himself in this movie. he plays a well rounded character that goes through a marvellous transformation. Kevin Costner just blows you away and renders a star sweeping performance. for anyone who has ever asked the question ""what is the point of the Coast Guard, or is the Coast Guard really military?"" this movie will show you the heart and soul and sacrifices that our men and women make as this is based on a true story!",The Guardian
171,hondaman-40749,Generally good but too many ' oorah's,7,22 April 2021,Better than expected but very gung ho with lots of oorah's in the first 2/3 of the film . Felt the film improved when the relationship between the central characters developed . There is no disputing the bravery of those who rescue others at sea but American movies always portray their heroes in this fashion. This spoils what could have been a very good film.,The Guardian
172,SoSTL,A movie that leaves you with a warm feeling,10,1 October 2006,"I just viewed this film today and it was one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. It was so much more than I ever expected, I went into it thinking that it would be just an up to date version of ""An officer and a gentleman"". I enjoyed this movie and Kevin Costner gave a stellar performance. To quote a friend of mine who viewed the film with me ""Kevin Costner is a stud"". This just showed why he is an actor for all ages and no matter how old he gets he just seems to get better and better. Ashton Kutcher was not the best for the role but he attempted to carry it out. I personally don't think his performance was that of Costner's level but he did not take away from the movie. After viewing this film, I felt the urge to want to be a US Coast Guard rescue diver. It really touched me in a way I did not even think could happen. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys an inspiring story. In a way it gives you a new found respect for the Coast Guards and the things that they go through personally, and business wise. They have to decide who to save first or who to leave behind to die, even though they want to believe that they can save everyone. In the end it's just a fantastic movie that is so much better you expect it to be. I only have one more thing to say for all those who save lives everyday the way we shower in the morning and that's ""ooh-rah"" and I love what you're doing.",The Guardian
173,corndog92,Too Long and Anti-Climatic,5,16 September 2006,"I saw an advanced screening of this movie. It ran about 2 and a half hours, and along the way, you could feel how anti-climatic it was. A lot of the movie was unnecessarily long, and you could not tell when it was about to end, because there were so many scenes that it could have ended with. It is never a good sign while watching a movie you are thinking about what you are going to do when it is over. This movie could have been a lot better if they shortened it, and cut some of the scenes. However, Costner delivers an amazing performance, as always. I have never been a big fan of Kutcher, but he was better in this than in some of his other movies. Ward's character was very one-dimensional and could have easily been cut out of the movie. Some aspects of this movie were great, such as the realism and suspense, but other aspects, such as the length and one-dimensional characters (yes, there were others) made it a very boring movie to watch through most of it. The only parts that interested me were the rescuing scenes, but they only occurred at the beginning and end of the movie. Overall, it gets a 5 / 10.",The Guardian
174,sophiereddy91,Phenomenal,10,26 January 2020,"I saw this movie in theaters many many years ago and I still watch it to this day. Costner and Kutcher have such amazing chemistry and camaraderie.

Also super surprised by all the low ratings.",The Guardian
175,easyeee,Decent flick,10,30 September 2006,"As others that have commented around the web... I'm a 130 pilot in the Coast Guard. Having said that, and being the skeptic I am, I went expecting the over-the-top cheese factors. There was some cheese, but all in all, not much.. and the film was pretty accurate.I watched the trailer again today. After seeing the film yesterday, I've realized the trailer gives the impression the movie is nothing but rescue after rescue action scenes. This isn't the case.The movie is truly more character/story driven than action. The inner struggles both Costner and Kutcher are dealing with.. Kutcher's is revealed further into than movie than Costner's is.Of course, there is a minor love story.. no surprise there. But for the most part, the movie tells the tale of two lives that come together, and after some time, help each other heal old wounds.As girlie as it sounds, Costner and, as much as I try not to like him, Kutcher do actually work quite well together and compliment each other very well in the movie.As critics have stated, you've seen it all before.. Top Gun, Officer and a Gentlemen, etc. But what movie hasn't been remade a million times.I can recall only one F word being spoken.. and can't really recall any other language.The movie is 2+ hours, and for some, may tend to get a little long towards the end.You'll laugh, you may cry, but I can honestly say, it was worth the $4 I paid.I hope you enjoy the movie.",The Guardian
176,burt12,Worthy of audience applause,8,8 September 2006,"I attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both have delivered less than memorable performances & films. While the underlying ""general"" storyline is somewhat familiar, this film was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other. The human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both; the scene when Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the film's most unforgettable emotional moment. The ""specific"" storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite Coast Guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job & responsibility...to save lives at sea. The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and ""wowing""...I haven't seen such angry seas since ""The Perfect Storm"". Co-star Clancy Brown (HBO's ""Carnivale"" - great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast Guard's Kodiak, Alaska base in a strong, convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins. The film wonderfully, and finally, gives long overdue exposure and respect to the Coast Guard; it had the audience applauding at the end.",The Guardian

I am a fan of K. Costner but i always held the contention that Aston KKutcher should just stick to his Punked routine and stay away from big budget Hollywood films(Just check out Butterfly effect and you will know what i mean). This movie however, had me from start to finish. Great Special F/x, well developed in its main characters. The only problem i had with this movie was that in introduced us to characters that never were developed at all. This blond girl that was in Kutchers Coast Guard class was pretty much forgotten about. Then there was the romance for Kutchers character that I found to be completely unnecessary. Kostners character has a wife and that would have been enough in that dept. This could have shortened the movie by like 15 min. But hey, thats why they pay directors and editor and i'm not one of them. Overall, you can tell by my vote that i would recommend this movie to all ages. Definitely see it before DVD.",The Guardian

180,rudabar2000,Kevin Costner was rescued.,8,23 October 2007,"This is a story about men and women that put their own life's at risk in order to save others every day. It follows Ben Randall (Kevin Costner) a veteran and well distinguished Coast Guard troubled by past events and a failing marriage. His life is in turmoil and finally pushed overboard with a tragic event which leaves him with no choice but to teach students to become the elite men and women of the U.S Coast Guard. Ben meets a young aspiring confident student named Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher) who at first glance is nothing but competitive and cares only for himself. These two unique personalities form a bond that will last a life time.This movie was really enjoyable and gives you a great respect for the U.S Coast Guard. Kevin Costner played his part excellent and was well suited for the role, a man at the end of his career and nothing much left in his life but still remained strong till the end. In a way almost like his acting career, perhaps thats why he was so believable in this role.Ashton Kutcher was also well suited for a over confident competitive character, but sadly the role required a transformation later on which was not so evident.The story was great with beautifully filmed and created scenes of rescues, the dreary grey rough oceans and the appearance of the UH-60 rescue helicopter in its bright white and orange colors gives the feeling of a light in the darkness. That there is hope. At one point during the training scenes a different camera was used to give us viewers the impression that we are seeing actual footage to add more realism.I found it to be a beautiful film with some great scenes to remember, it will give you pride and respect for the U.S Coast Guard.Heart warming 8/10",The Guardian
181,kelland-3,finally a family flick,9,16 September 2006,"Our entire family, mother, father and two sons (including our jaded teenager), enjoyed the sneak preview of this movie. We laughed, smiled and almost cried. There is a tiny bit of bad language and implied sex but it is a great family film for all but the most prudish. It has been quite a while since we went to a movie that actually had a plot that made sense and went somewhere. This is the movie we've been waiting to see this summer. There are characters for every generation and decent dialogue. It is a pro-military movie, at least pro-Coast Guard, with a lot of duty/honor thrown in. The Hurricane Katrina clips from actual Coast Guard rescues at the very beginning of the credits are worth staying in your seat to watch.",The Guardian
182,dayzebabe,A love letter to the USCG,7,25 September 2006,"My yardstick for measuring a movie's watch-ability is if I get squirmy. If I start shifting positions and noticing my butt is sore, the film is too long. This movie did not even come close to being boring. Predictable in some parts sure, but never boring.All of the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up, why not the Coast Guard too? They are definitely under-appreciated, until the day your boat sinks that is.The movie was very enjoyable and fun. Kevin Costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesn't know when to quit. However, I was most impressed by Ashton Kutcher's performance. I have never liked him, never watched any of his TV shows and always considered him an immature ... well, punk. In this film, he does a great job! He is well on his way to having leading-man status. I think the film we were shown must have been an advance rough cut or something, because about 2/3 of the way in, the film stock turned very grainy, the sound level dropped and microphones were seen dropping down all over the place. Also at the viewing were representatives from the movie, looking for audience feedback - particularly on the parts of the film we didn't like.*****POSSIBLE SPOILER: The feedback I gave concerned a a couple of lines in the beginning. Kevin Costner comes home to see his wife, Sela Ward, packing her stuff up and moving out. He says, ""Maybe I should be the one to move out."" And she replies, ""No, you don't know where anything is in this house; I should be the one to go."" This doesn't make sense: If she knows the layout so well, Costner is right, he *should* be the one to leave.",The Guardian

Not only was it a good story, but according to my buddy, everything except the command center was quite authentic both visually and technically. The command center was clearly a Hollywood addition, but it didn't really take anything away from the movie. Kevin Costner did a good job of playing the salty old Swimmer and Ashton Kutcher was surprising good in a serious role, which I had not previously imagined him being able to do. All-in-all, a great tribute to the men and women of the United States Coast Guard. They are truly unsung heroes. It's about time Hollywood remembered them!",The Guardian

My father died and my mother is still alive. I didn't want it to bring back the memories of losing my father, but I went anyways.The movie started out a little slow, but as it got going, I was impressed. Costner did a wonderful job in his role and I was surprised I could take Kutcher seriously. He did his role alright as well.In the end, I walked out of the theater with soaked eyes.

I, for one, had low hopes about this movie, judging by how Ashton Kutchers' previous screenplays has been! Though I find Kevin Costner a very exciting but ""tense"" actor, this movie has brought him even higher up on my ""list"", Ashton Kutcher was there to complete KCs' role in the movie, it felt like a battle between Ashton and Kevin, who is really the better actor? Ashton fills his role as a young lifesaver extraordinarily well here. The film is very long, over 2 hours I think? However, it didn't feel like it at all, I was rather AMUSED at the cinema, as previous commenter said, it thrilled the whole audience, people were laughing together, clapping their hands at scenes, and such. , I would very much recommend this movie as you will have a great 2 hours of excitement and laugther, whilst fighting against your tears.One of the best movies this year, by far.",The Guardian
186,Mehilba,Typical American Heroic nonsense,2,27 October 2006,"I went to the movie as a Sneak Preview in Austria. So didn't have an idea what I am going to see. The story is very normal. The movie is very long , I believe it could have cut to 1/2 without causing any problems to the story. Its the type of movie you can see in a boring night which you want to get bored more ! Ashton Kutcher was very good . Kevin Costner is OK. The movie is speaking about the US Coast Guards, how they are trained , their life style and the problems they face. As there aren't much effects in the movie. So if you want to watch it , then no need to waste your money and time going to the Cinema. Would be more effective to watch it at home when it gets on DVDs.",The Guardian
187,hoakua,We need more movies of this type.,9,30 October 2006,"I truly enjoyed this movie. The ratings were not high but everyone that I knew who saw it said it was great. I truly agree. It was decemt drama and informative about a subject (coast guard rescue swimmers) that I had no knowledge on, the acting was good, filming fantastic and no violence, very little sexual content and only one cuss word that I noticed. Of course having Ashton Kucther to look at for 2 hrs was wow. I was glad to see Kevin Costner still holds his own. Movies like this need to be supported for those that are against a lot of sex and violence. Nice to be able to take the family to a movie that we could all enjoy no matter what age and it wasn't animated or something dumb.",The Guardian
188,djjorgo,I loved this movie so much,10,14 December 2006,"This movie is one of the best ever made. The acting the music and the special effects were so good. They really did a very good job on this one, they made many of the things said in the movie very inspiring. When it comes out on d.v.d I'll be there buying it as soon as I can. The story was truly great. I tip my hat to the directer for this one. If there is going to be a second one I'll be seeing it. I was glued to my chair as i watched it. Many of the parts in it made me feel inspired and at parts glad. I give it 10/10What did you guys think of itYour Australian friend",The Guardian
189,djgrand,Very underrated Movie!,9,27 January 2013,"This movie was so underrated in my opinion. I have to admit, I originally had low expectations and only saw it because I actually think Kutcher is a pretty good actor. I have to admit I was surprise. The movie was not slow, it kept the viewer engage and all these people crying about how sappy & cliché it was, I don't know what they're talking about. One of the things I like best is that unlike similar movies such as ""a soldier and a gentle men"",or damn near every military movie ever made, it tried to not dwell in the clichés too long. The movie did'nt dwell in the love story, or the young man coming into him self story, nor did it harp on the coast guard the way most propaganda military movies do. It was quite balance in my opinion. Now, I must admit, there were little moments that were slightly over the top but never unrealistic. These so called critics amaze me with their crappy reviews that seem to like nothing unless it's historical, overly politically correct or is a representation of what they deem even worthy which is usually boring. How could they pan this movie and give rave reviews to total crap like looper...I'm done!",The Guardian
190,raggum,Action packed and good film,7,21 January 2007,"This movie was powerful and absolutely showed me about the side of the coast guard I never knew about. I was disappointed in the ending though, as I felt it left a few things unanswered, but others I talked to loved the movie, even the ending. Maybe I just didn't get it, but it seemed to be a very unlikely scenario.Kevin Costner of course is fantastic as the swimmer who now has to train new swimmers. His training practices are rigorous and at first comes across as being down right cruel. However, once you realize just what these guys must endure while preforming a rescue, he is only training to choose the top swimmers. I do recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good love story, plus action rescue scenes. It's a good date movie, as women and men would find it entertaining. (Take some tissues ladies, as there is a good tear jerking scene!)",The Guardian
191,sainibh,Amazing movie and Costner is a great actor,10,10 October 2007,I'm completely impressed by the movie it's a kind of a movie that inspire people to join such organizations coastguard and rescue teams the story about Ben (Costner) is beautiful what he goes through after losing his team and what he goes through in his personal life how he put others in front of himself and his life his marriage is falling apart and even then all he is doing is saving lives that's amazing and Costner did to perfection. Even Fischer (Kutcher) did his part very well a rookie who thinks he got it all and then how he learns from Ben not just the lesson about how to be good coastguard swimmer but how to live with your shortcomings and how make right decision in life and while saving lives.I would give it full marks. Lovely inspiring and beautiful movie.,The Guardian
192,Coleyy,The Guardian,9,3 February 2007,"This action packed, thrill seeker movie is good for anyone who likes watching military movies. This movie shows great character between the young men and women who stick together in a Coast Guard school.In order to do Rescue Diving, they must complete school for a total of 18 weeks and graduation in order to continue. Kevin Costner and Ashton Kucher are wonderful actors in this breath taking movie. This movie I would recommend for teenagers and up only because of some of the behavior and things that go on throughout the movie. ""Yes Senior Chief,"" is how the students must say to their instructor (Costner) and must cooperate in order to graduate. In the end (without me giving away the ending, because then there would be no point of watching it then) someone does a good leadership skill that will make the ending incredible and might make you cry. Overall, this was a wonderful movie and I think this one is def. one to add to your collection.",The Guardian
193,zzsilentbobzz,Accurate portrayal of the USCG...,9,17 September 2006,"I'm a Petty Officer 1st Class (E-6) and have been in the USCG for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the Coast Guard. There were only a few scenes that were far fetched. The most far-fetched was when PO Fischer (Kutcher) went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessel's captain out of the engine room... that would never happen. Swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances. Second, the Command Center (supposedly in Kodiak), it looked more like a NASA command center... we don't have any gear that hi-tech. Third, the Captain of the Airstation would not be running the search & rescue cases with like 10 people on watch. In reality it would be an E-6 or E-7 as the SAR Controller and maybe 2 other support personnel like an assist SAR Controller & a Radio Watchstander. Otherwise the movie was dead on, I think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the CG and their roles in search & rescue instead of just Aviation based rates. Some of the scenes from ""A"" school reminded me of my days their and the dumb stuff I did and got in trouble for in my younger days.",The Guardian
194,annehexste,"I was surprised, it was actually good!",7,23 January 2011,"I never got to see this one in the theater, but it seemed interesting enough to give it a try. The story involves the Coast Guard's elite rescue swimmers. These are the men and women who go in during storms to rescue people, or if a ship is sinking, or any other waterborn operation. They have a very risky job, and only the best make it through the training. The story involves a young recruit(Kutcher) and a legendary older veteran(Costner). Kutcher is a champion swimmer, but he is hiding something inside him and may not be there for the right reasons. Costner has just lost his best friend on a mission, and is being forced into the position of teacher for some down time. He is also dealing with his wife leaving him. This movie is about growth in the student and teacher, and about sacrifice. It is shades of An Officer and a Gentleman with a little Perfect Storm thrown in. It is a well told and made film. Costner is a bit wooden at times, but he gets by with typical Costner charm. Kutcher is decent in the role. I still have trouble seeing him in non-comedic roles. Though I did like him in The Buttefly Effect. Overall this is a good movie. I would give it a try.",The Guardian
195,CloudyNight,Surprisingly Good,7,1 October 2006,"As I walked into the theatre, waiting for the movie to start, I could feel inside of me apprehension. I worried, as I had for weeks, that Ashton wouldn't live up to the role. I have been waiting for this one to come out for quite awhile now, and I wasn't about to ditch it because I was unsure of how he'd do....But I did pay $15 to get in....So I'm sure you can imagine how happy I was that I had no reason to be worried.The acting, I thought, was brilliant. I haven't seen Kutcher in a role quite like this, and I must say it was a pleasant surprise to see him so entwined with the character.The actual plot? It was actually rather predictable. It was pretty easy to tell what was going on, and that took away from it. Overall? It was great. Definitely worth seeing again.",The Guardian
196,tinkicker,very good story. pretty accurate. One of Costner's best,10,8 October 2006,"Overall the movie was very well done. Only minor details really inaccurate. Saying the swimmer is inserting ""upswell"" when they very clearly drop him ""downswell"". Some oddball radio lingo. Seem to remember that the ""A"" school is in Elisabeth City, NC rather than Shreveport (Barksdale AFB). I also don't remember any Squid bars in northwest Louisiana either. Mostly stuff that most people wouldn't notice. Training center scenes are fairly accurate. Treading water with all your clothes on for an hour isn't easy. They usually have divers in the pool with them though. Highest attrition rate of any CG schools. I've been retired from the Guard for about 10 years. If the ops center at Kodiak is as portrayed, we've got a lot better equipment than I was used to. Ought to make recruiting go up. Most of the swimmers I worked with are about half crazy. Got to be to do that sort of thing. But God love em for it. Costner comes across pretty well as a Senior Chief too.",The Guardian
197,keanu218,Great movie,8,17 September 2006,"Last night we seen The Guardian with Kevin Costner. WOW !! Kevin you rock, I really enjoyed the movie, as well as my family ( all guys) that went with me for the sneak preview in Arizona. Great job from the whole movie cast. I really felt like it was the real thing, I lived close to where the Coast Guard train in Astoria Oregon so I know how bad that sea can be so ""BRAVO"" for the big water tank you made it look real. I hope Kevin does more movies like this it shows that even though he is getting a little gray, thats OK, you get only better and better. A great actor Thanks for some great movies.

198,thebestbheart,Kostner's The Postman a LOT better than user says,7,24 January 2007,"I agree with the user that said that this movie was the best that Kevin Kostner has done in awhile. I would add though that an exception is, The Upside of Anger - a great movie - although, Joan Allen can make any movie good. I would also say that this user's comment: "".....the kind of nauseous acting that made The Postman one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time..."" is so wrong - The Postman is ten times the movie that The Guardian is. I do agree that The Guardian is a very good movie and for all the reasons the commenter said - I just disagree that The Postman was such a bad movie. The Postman was meant to be far-reaching in it's coldness and connection with the fear of the unknown - it touched our buttons. It has a pace which is meant to make us feel as if we are actually going through the same apocalyptic fears.",The Guardian
199,X-Files-Junky,Following Costner's movies,7,25 January 2007,"I just finished watching the Guardian. I found this movie to my liking. I think that Kevin Costner did a great job portraying his character, as well as the other actors. The plot was sometimes predictable but non-the-less, it was entertaining.I did notice one bit of trivia: Clancy Brown is portraying a character named ""Capt. Hadley"", for the second time. The first being as a corrupt prison Captian, "" Capt. Byron Hadley"", in ""The Shawshank Redemption"", another great movie.I do look forward to more of Costners movies. He may not put out as many movies as some actors but when he does, they are usually very good with only a few exceptions. Waterworld comes to mind but it was still an OK movie. ""Message in a Bottle"" is another that was not exactly my type but that is about it.",The Guardian
200,Mariner719,Pretty good movie,7,30 September 2006,"As a Coast Guard veteran and chief petty officer, I couldn't help enjoying this movie. I've been to AirSta Kodiak dozens of times and it was good to see the place again. Of course, anyone who's been there knows that not EVERY rescue takes place in mountainous seas and hurricane-force winds, but that's drama for you. The acting ranged from pretty good to excellent, and the technical facts stayed pretty close to home, with a few concessions to viewer expectations, such as the high-tech Kodiak Operations Center (the OpCen would be well-lit, manned mostly by enlisted personnel, and probably wouldn't have all that video equipment). In all fairness to the Navy, they were sorely misrepresented in the bar-fight scene - the guys in khaki were supposed to be chief petty officers, and most of the Navy chiefs I've known would never hang out in a bar picking fights, especially in those shabby-looking work uniforms. No, my only real complaint is that, once again, the Coast Guard has been represented as a service that seems to make exclusive use of aircraft, particularly helicopters, to make each and every rescue. We have ships! LOTS of ships! Big, highly-capable ships manned by brave crews who fight just as hard against the elements as their aviation colleagues do. And with the exception of USCGC STORIS, USCGC ALEX HALEY, and an unidentified buoy tender, all of which were shown either moored to the fuel pier at Base Kodiak or moving slowly in port, there was no evidence of shipboard activity at all. This movie might have been a real boon to Coast Guard recruiting, and much more realistic, if they might have just slipped in a scene of a helicopter landing to refuel on a 378-foot high endurance cutter in the Bering Sea, for example, because 378's are out there ALL THE TIME, in every season. But, that's show biz.",The Guardian
201,titansfaninva,A Rewarding Film,10,29 September 2006,"I went into this film expecting an overblown, Hollywood story of action and heroism, but left it utterly astounded by what I had just seen. In one of America's most unrecognized forms of protection, there truly are heroes - that's the message that this motion picture gave me, and I wouldn't regret returning to the theaters to see it again. All-in-all, this movie is much like ""Pearl Harbor"" in both it's organization and themes. One of those movies with the perfect balance of action, drama, and romance. Ashton Kutcher's emotions are as close to real as you can get. All the actors works are nothing less than superb. This film also couldn't have come out at a better time. Roughly a year since Katrina's hitting of the U.S., and what else comes out but a movie telling the story of two fictitious, but nonetheless, believable Coast Guard members. As this movie was dedicated to the USCG (United States Coast Guard), it pleased me and my family very much, due to our ties to the Coast Guard. This movie was one of the most rewarding films I've seen in theaters, and was definitely my highlight for my Autumn 2006. If you've ever been to the beach, or gone to sea, and seen the Coast Guard, or otherwise have affiliations with them, this movie will make you appreciate their protection and the courage it must take for them to risk their lives to save ours.",The Guardian
202,goodapollo2,Much More Than I Expected,9,28 September 2006,"I work at a movie theater and every Thursday night we have an employee screening of one movie that comes out the next day...Today it was The Guardian. I saw the trailers and the ads and never expected much from it, and in no way really did i anticipate seeing this movie. Well turns out this movie was a lot more than I would have thought. It was a great story first of all. Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner did amazing acting work in this film. Being a big fan of That 70's Show I always found it hard thinking of Kutcher as anyone but Kelso despite the great acting he did in The Butterfly Effect, but after seeing this movie I think I might be able to finally look at him as a serious actor.It was also a great tribute to the unsung heroes of the U.S. Coast Guard.",The Guardian
203,dflory318,A must see,10,13 February 2007,"When I heard there was going to be a movie made about the Coast Guard, I was a little hesitant. I am a Coast Guard ""brat"". My father worked on the helicopters as a hoist-man before the rescue swimmer program came about. I was surprised at how accurately this film portrays the life these people lead. I think Kevin and Ashton both did an incredible job of portraying actual rescue swimmers. After we saw the film, I asked my dad how realistic it was. I could see by the look on his face that it was very realistic and had brought back some memories. I would like to thank the actors and directors for doing such a great job on portraying these everyday heroes.",The Guardian
204,q-91396,Attention to the Coast Guard,9,3 June 2019,"All the time war movies are talking about the Army, Marines, Airforce, and Navy, but rarely do you get to see what it looks like to be in the other United States military branch. The Coast Guard. The Guardian is about Coast Guard rescue swimmer Senior Chief Ben Randall (Kevin Costner) losing his crew in an accident at sea then going to be an instructor at the Coast Guard's A school. The rescue swimmer training school. This is where he meets high school swim champion, Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher) a cocky recruit who is set on just breaking records rather than saving lives. Randall takes it upon himself to change Fischer into a selfless rescue swimmer rather than an arrogant one.
Before watching this movie, I knew next to nothing about the coast guard but after seeing it left me wanting to learn more. The film did a phenomenal job depicting just how hard A school is and then how difficult of a job being a rescue swimmer is. One theme I saw a lot throughout the movie was the saying, ""So others may live."" That saying is the Coast Guards motto, and it played an essential role in the film as many scenes were zooming in on plaques and other things with that saying on it. Senior Chief said that to his men every time they messed up or weren't doing something right.
Senior Chief is a static character in the movie, and Fischer is a dynamic character. The best scene in the film is when you see Fischer change from being cocky to revealing what Fischer has been through and why he is so arrogant. This occurs after he is bailed out of jail for getting in a bar fight at one of the ""marine"" bars. After being brought back to the base, he has to talk to Senior Chief. This is where the Chief reveals he knows Fischer's background that his high school swim team was killed in an accident and he was the only one to survive. The emotion in this scene helped build the mood and helped viewers truly feel Fischer's pain.
Overall I believe the movie did a great job portraying the life of a rescue swimmer as well as what it takes to be one. I think the producer did a great job with the film, and the main actors were the right fit for the film as well. I had doubts at first as most movies I have seen with Kutcher have been comedies, but I believe he did a great job in the role of Fischer in this film. Another piece that added to the film was its soundtrack. Songs like Club Foot by Kasabian and Never Let Go by Bryan Adams added a lot to the film and helped portray the energy the producer tried to show.
In conclusion, I would recommend this movie to anyone. With strong acting, editing, and producing, I don't think there were very many weaknesses in the film. I remained entirely focused and entertained throughout the entirety of the film.",The Guardian
205,rebellicbanshee,Makes the Coast Guard well honored,10,29 September 2006,"I didn't really know what to expect when i first decided to go. Just knew it had to be good. And I was right. The director is very well known and did a great job with this one. In reference to the comment I saw on here regarding disappointing ending, about it moving faster, I disagree. It moved quite nice. This is not a movie that Hollywood has changed in order to make money. Finally the Coast Guard gets the recognition it needs from the world and is no longer the wimp when compared to the military.Language was moderate but to be expected. You can bring your parents to this movie and not think ""Oh crap, a sex scene. I'm never gonna hear the end of this."" Very well made on different parts of life. Overall, great date movie, Not a chick flick, and the ending has both qualities of good and unexpected. Worth the 8 bucks a piece.",The Guardian

This is a world of rescue that we don't to see very often and Kevin Coaster with Ashton Kutcher showing us the emotion that goes with this job. Remarkable! Enjoy seeing John Heard and Sheila Ward again on the big screen. This is a must movie see on the big screen movie with the high rolling seas. You feel the pain of the training. You are at the edge of your seat hoping and cheering Kutcher and others though ""A"" school.

That's OK the details were interesting and it's good to see the Coasties get their moment. The bar fight scene was ridiculous. 26 years in the Navy and I've never seen a bar fight. Just doesn't happen any more. Especially with senior officers present. Anyway the story was good and I was ready to get up and go as Fisher goes on his first solo rescue and Costner goes in to see his wife with retirement papers in his hand. That would have been a great time for fade to black, but no he pushes it and goes for WaterWorld with the final 20 minutes. Melodramitic and silly. I watched the alternate ending on DVD hoping maybe they had at least shot it, But no, it's the same except he gets pulled into the helo as the cable lets go. There were also scenes deleted that explained the tension between Costner ant the CPO and what happened to the blond candidate. Keep those and skip everything after retirement and it's a solid movie.",The Guardian

There is a lot of great things about this movie it has great acting, great camera work and some of the best special effects i have ever seen in a movie, so good that you need to go prepared to be sea sick.

I'll admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of Ashton Kutcher he was only able to do comedy. I was wrong. Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well, and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism. The sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions. This one did exactly that. The entire theater (which was sold out) was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie, and were moved to tears during the second half. While exiting the theater I not only saw many women in tears, but many full grown men as well, trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying. This movie was great, and I suggest that you go see it before you judge.",The Guardian

The rescues and sea effects were amazing to watch and definitely provided edge of the seat tense moments, probably all the more so knowing that there are guys who do this for a living. The weaker parts of the movie revolve largely around using stereotypical set scenes. I'm not going to spoil the movie but this really follows along the lines of An Officer and a Gentleman and those moments give it a little bit of a cheesy aftertaste.Like I said over all this movie is pretty good and worth checking out as long as you can get past the clichés.",The Guardian

There is NO chemistry between Kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest. The dialog is wooden, the situations hackneyed. It's too long and the climax is anti-climactic(!). I love the USCG, its men and women are fearless and tough. The action scenes are awesome, but this movie doesn't do much for recruiting, I fear. The script is formulaic, but confusing. Kutcher's character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that wasn't his fault? Costner's is raging against the dying of the light, but why? His 'conflict' with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle. I saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt I got my money's worth.",The Guardian

Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters Ben and Jake. After seeing this movie, you can't help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the USCG helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescues.Even though this is a fictional movie, it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit, dedication and bravery exhibited by all the members of the actual U. S. Coast Guard.The special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible. You actually felt like you were taking part in a real rescue.I feel the movie could have been made without the ""Hollywood"" bar scene (when you see the movie, you might agree) since the real Coast Guard does not condone such behavior. Very entertaining, very action packed, definitely worth seeing. Thank you, U. S. Coast Guard and the REAL helicopter rescue swimmers, ""So Others May Live"".

I found myself watching many water scenes wondering ""how do they do that?"" There are both intense, sad, emotional parts and also some comic relief. Costner and Kutcher had good chemistry together. Their scenes near the end made me teary eyed. Parts were predictable, but just when I thought I had it all figured out, it changed. The storyline was shocking. It flowed well.

They were a great match, and I felt that they really pulled off one of the best movies I have seen this year.

I would recommend it to anyone, it inspires courage and it causes you to gain great admiration and respect for those men that risk their lives to go save the life of another. I'm not a big fan of Ashton Kutcher either, but he does a remarkable job and he plays his part perfectly. Also, Kevin Costner does an incredible job. I just watched the trailer for the movie and it doesn't even come close to how the real movie is, in fact it is a very poor representation of the plot and storyline. Also, all of the supporting roles are appropriately cast, and they play their parts perfectly. Whoever wrote the script did an amazing job.

The was a danger of a movie centered around any Coast Guard job appearing cheesy (ala: Charlie Sheen SEAL flick or... dare I bash... Top Gun) Andrew Davis did NOT disappoint us. The Guardian, first of all, is a very good story. It is not about the Coast Guard...it is just centered around Coast Guard rescue swimmers and some of the missions performed by the service.The movies running time (2:15) was not noticeable to me when I watched the film. I had no idea it was that long until I looked at my watch when it was over.Kutcher CAN act and is given room to do so in this film. Costner does an outstanding job. And for those of you worried about realism, let me just say .....very few things in the film are not plausible. 95% of what happens in the school scenes takes place at the real school. Costner's character (Costner himself for that matter) is not too old to be a rescue swimmer, either.There is (of course) some real Hollywood in the film. Our operations centers are not NEAR as high-tech as they are portrayed in the film...but the technology helps tell the story so all is forgiven.Anyway, for what it is worth, I truly loved the film.",The Guardian
217,patrick-682,Costner's Comeback,8,16 September 2006,"I went to an advance screening of this movie thinking I was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy lines, mindless plot, and the kind of nauseous acting that made ""The Postman"" one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time. But I was shocked. Shocked to find a film starring Costner that appealed to the soul of the audience. Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could act in such a serious role. Shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions. Not since 'Robin Hood' have I seen this Costner: full of depth and complex emotion. Kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious acting he played with in ""Butterfly Effect"". These two actors came into this film with a serious, focused attitude that shone through in what I thought was one of the best films I've seen this year. No, its not an Oscar worthy movie. It's not an epic, or a profound social commentary film. Rather, its a story about a simple topic, illuminated in a way that brings that audience to a higher level of empathy than thought possible. That's what I think good film-making is and I for one am throughly impressed by this work. Bravo!",The Guardian
218,Todayisagrnday21,Deeper than a tear jerker,7,17 September 2006,"I went to the advance screening of this movies expecting a mediocre tear jerker. Turns out the Enjoyed the movie quite a bit. This is no blockbuster, but I do think that if you're sitting at home on a Friday night, this would be a good excuse to get out of the house. I must admit it has some cheesy and other downright cliché parts. But overall, its a movie that I may go see with another group of people, or rent when it comes out. Ashton Kutcher is not my favorite actor, but he did a decent job (or at least better than he has done before). Kevin Costner did a good job. Anyways, good movie to go out to. I don't recommend taking the kids though. It is a lengthy movie and perhaps too dry for some kids.",The Guardian

It keeps you on the edge of the seat. i fell in love with Ashton Kutcher. His charm he was such an amazing actor. He portrayed adorable goofiness and also extremely humorous. Costners performance was great too. I cried my eyes out in the end but it was so worth it. Every person that came out of the movie theater was talking about how good it was and how it was the best they have seen. I am really impressed by Ashton Kutcher.So adorable, everyone should see it you wont regret it i promise! They should make a second one. So go see it. It is the best. No joke.",The Guardian

However, the film delivered quality, engrossing entertainment and was beyond my expectations. THANK YOU to the actors, directors, crew, etc...for a film that may go on to be a classic in the true sense of the word. BRAVO! Kutcher and Costner are believable, likable and they compliment one another. The supporting cast is exceptional and the real day to day challenges of the Coast Guard rescue swimmers are beautifully reflected in the storyline. Costner is back on top where he should stay! Kutcher shows his talents and both men deserve a well-earned round of applause for their performances. I cannot wait until September 29th when I can see it again and again....",The Guardian
221,glcollier,Amusing.,7,25 September 2007,"What everyone else said about predictable plot. Oh and the cheesy ending. It's Hollywood and they didn't want to have to make a sequel. Also, there has always been a little mysticism among sailors and the like. So why not? I mean we were always watching movies about a certain pirate, yes? I'm just going to put in my two cents worth. Call it a goof if you like. Barksdale Air Force Base is in northwest Louisiana, nowhere near the ocean or any other major body of water, except for a few bayous, a river, and some lakes. I thought it was interesting to see how they made my base into a coast guard type place. its funny to me.",The Guardian

My father is in the Coast Guard and a whole bunch of Coasties and i went to see the movie. It is a FANTASTIC MOVIE! It is WONDERFUL! at first i thought that it would be completely untrue to what the Coast Guard does, but what you will see in this movie is PRECISELY what the Coast Guard does! I am so proud of the coast guard and what my father does, and i am therefore PROUD of this movie. Do not mistake Ashton Kutcher for a bad actor. When you see the way he is acting, i reassure you, you are NOT being PUNKD. This guy has GOT some acting skills! You will definitely be surprised. Especially in the scene where he has to cry. Those are REAL TEARS coming out of his eyes.IF you love action thrillers that keep you on the edge of your seat, PLEASE GO SEE THIS MOVE!

I give it a 9 and not a 10 because there are some clichés too obvious but after all, a 9 movie it's a 9 movie. Ashton Kutcher plays very good, some say that he's a bad actor, this movie proves they are wrong. Kevin Costner don't need comments about his work, he is Kevin Costner and that's it! You spend like 2 hours watching this movie but you don't even remember that you have a watch. You are seeing and wanting to know what is coming next... only a good story catch us to the screen like that!

224,keliane24,awesome movie!!,10,21 September 2006,"i saw this movie in a theater with about 300 navy personnel in chicago. a great many of these young people had just graduated from boot camp. it was amazing to see this well-made movie with sound effects in the background from the surrounding sailors when something exciting happened. i believe that the writers and directors did an outstanding job of inserting the many different aspects of the characters lives. Kostner showed how he was being torn by the love of his wife and his job. Kutcher showed his zany side as well as showing the issues that he was forced to deal with that brought him to that point. The passion the two men showed towards the job was apparent. The recognition of something special in each of them towards the other was also very apparent. Overall, an excellent movie that i will definitely see again when its released!!",The Guardian
225,shrimpycoo,See it.,8,25 September 2006,"Definitely worth seeing. Unnecessarily sad ending though. It's almost like they can't make movies emotional enough anymore without doing something irrational to certain characters that just make you go - 'Damn, That was unnecessary.' I guess that's the easy way to make a movie emotionally intense.Besides that the movie is only slow in one part and even then the dialog is written well enough for it to be endurable. It's also very tied into real life as we know it now. It relates to Katrina a little and may even have some actual 'Katrina' coast guards in it. I'm seeing it again when it's released. Luckily I had premiere tickets, I wish I knew how to get more...",The Guardian
226,seduh93,The Guardian gets my vote!,8,19 October 2006,"The Guardian begins as the legendary rescue swimmer Ben Randell (Kevin Costner) has a tragic accident and decides to teach at the ""A"" School until he believes he is fit for his duties. At the school, he has suspicions that there is more than what meets the eye about one of his trainees; Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher). As a swim team champion and cocky young man, Jake Fischer believes that if he joins the U.S. Coast Guard it will make up for some past regrets. Through his struggles with his girlfriend and a few mishaps, Jake decides that if he should become a Coast Guard it shouldn't be to make up for his past but to live up to the Coast Guard motto, "" So others may live. "" With this in mind, Jake achieved what others never thought possible. I think the movie was one of the best of the year! Ashton Kutcher really stepped up to the plate and did his part. He took the role, and made it believable. Keven Costner surprised me. In a good way of course. The movie showed lots of character, and heart felt moments. The movie was very enjoyable, and made me proud for the people who protect us and our country.I do think there are weak points as every movie has. The movie was funny, entertaining, heart throbbing, and all together a great movie! Coast Guards are put in danger everyday to save our lives, the movie was not shy of showing us the danger, and that is one main reason why I love this movie! It doesn't focus mainly on slap-stick comedy; it focused on the determination of the Coast Guards. The Guardian gets my vote a 100%!",The Guardian

The movie easily captured my attention from the very first scene and never let go. They say ""When the student is ready the Master appears."" Well, I never expected such incredible life lessons from such a completely unexpected source. Sometimes we focus on a thing so much that we miss the point all together. This was a beautifully executed lesson. ""So Others May Live"" The performances were excellent. Gut wrenchingly so, that your focus remains only on the characters and not at all on the actors. This one will definitely stay with you for a long while. Incredible!!",The Guardian

The movie shows what the really do and how hard the job is.I think being a USCG would be challenging and very scary. It was a great movie all around. I would suggest this movie for anyone to see.The ending broke my heart but I know why he did it. The storyline was great I give it 2 thumbs up.

Oh my my and oooh tally ho, the movie does not display but a jollyroger of what could be a phenomenal film.Of course it was not the first time we've had to clash swords with such an inexperienced director.

Both Ashton and Kevin gave phenomenal performances. what a great way to remember those who give their lives to save others. Way to go!!! It would be a true pity to miss this one. Some say this movie isn't very good but I would like to know where they are getting this idea. This movie is the bomb. I cried at the end, and not too many movies effect me in such a way. I always thought Ashton Kutcher was a more than what you see type of actor, and this movie just proves me right. I thought it was a waste of his talent in that TV show he use to be on. Now he is showing his true colors and it's great to see. Keven Costner has always been on top of my favorites list, and it just goes to show why he is still there.",The Guardian
232,rainbow-ranch,Touching movie,10,4 October 2006,"Excellent Movie! I watched it yesterday , cause I had Preview tickets. Useally I wouldn't go to watched it, but it really surprised me! In the end the main character Ben Randall played by Kevin Costner kills himself, to rescue Fisher. At the beginning Fisher was selfish, only caring about himself. He was the superstar, he was the best. He changed his personality because Randell teaches him to be a better person and so in the end he is a nice guy. For me the Climax was at the moment when Randall and Fisher were hanging under the helicopter and the wire rope starts to break. Fisher says He wont let him go, Randall answers I know, opens his handcuff. Randall falls 30 meters down into the ocean, and everybody knows at that moment that he dies there. This is a moving film about a guy who lost his team because of an accident and his wife because she thinks he works to much. After the accident he gets the job to train the new students there he meets Fisher. Randall uses some unusual methods, but it works.",The Guardian

The mic showed up in the top of the frame in sooooo many scenes that I wished I had counted - I'm sure it must have been over 20 scenes! I mean it was DISTRACTING!!!! Can't someone fix this or is sloppy tech work/editing (like clothes) the new acceptable????? Anyway, I can live with predictable stories if they are well told and have other redeeming qualities.

I liked Kutcher's role, he didn't come off as an idiot like he usually does. Costner was good as usual. I would have liked a bit more background development on his character. I was fascinated by the multiple entry techniques demonstrated, the drop to the ship seemed risky due to the pitching ship's mast, although dropping into the ocean without a rescue line is also fraught with peril. Someone else wrote the ending went too quick and I agree. I think they should have run 3 or 4 missions together before Costner's character had issues.Did anyone else see the microphone drop down at the end?",The Guardian

Then I realized that this is the best movie I have ever seen. I would say The Guardian is the best film from Kevin Costner. A must see film. If you like to watch good suspense movies then you have to go see this one. The Guardian beats by far any film I have ever seen. The Guardian at times was very suspenseful. One thing I did like is that it is a ""story"" kind of movie. My vote is A++++. I have always been wanting to see a good suspense but one that gets you really in the movie like you actually know the characters; this one did it for me. The Guardian is a well written movie.",The Guardian
236,deenasherwood,How they maneuvered the ending? Gimme a break,4,8 July 2021,"Spoilers: The action scenes were good. The emotional backgrounds that motivated Costner and Kusher were ok if not original. The middle-class ""Officer and a Gentleman"" trope was a bit heavy-handed. The marriage broken down by The Job was trite. The ending was predictable, but the cause? The same outcome could've been achieved with a line-of-duty decision not equipment failure.

Actually the character fits well with what he portrays a lot of the time. But it fits. I am a Kevin Costner fan and found this to be one of his best. I loved the beautiful ocean scenes and the intenseness of the ships in trouble is a must see on the big screen. The movie had some of everything... humor, romance, heroism, fights, etc. I didn't find the movie slow at all. And above all, I left the theater with a respect and a realization of what the Coast Guard does. Ashamedly, I never thought about it before. I loved the comment about the Navy vs the Coast Guard.

I mean it. It was perfect! The movie built and built to a tremendously satisfactory finish. The kind of finish that leaves you walking out of the theater with tears rolling down your cheeks yet with a big smile on your face and enlightenment in your soul.Then someone sold out their principles because that perfect ending ""didn't test well in the demographic we're seeking."" So an additional voice-over was quickly recorded and a new scene was hurriedly shot and spliced into the final releases before they were sent to the theaters.I know this in my heart. The ending you will see in the theater is NOT the director or writer's true vision.I feel sorry for you guys. I can only rationalize that you just didn't have enough ""creative control"" (because I can't say balls), to keep your original vision as you meant it to be.Please, when the DVD comes out. FIGHT for your vision to be returned to this fine movie.Okay, for the audience yet to be and I of course mean those of you outside the demographic that those soulless, visionless hacks that handle the money-side of film-making are seeking You, gentle, mature, moviegoer, let me share with you a few words of wisdom: When the late voice-over by Kutcher finishes as it was originally meant to be finished, SPRINT for the exit. Trust me, unless you are a soulless, visionless hack yourself, you'll know the exact moment I'm talking about. But it passes so quickly that you will have little time before the SELLOUT begins.If you happen to miss that opening and fail to get out before a wonderful movie becomes just okay. Well, like me, you'll find yourself laughing and shaking your head as you walk to your car. Like me, you will wonder at the opportunity lost when a truly great movie is sacrificed on the altar of having to ""test well"" with an audience that thinks Ren and Stimpy are great actors.Like me, you'll find that the tears that a perfect ending drew from you, that you willingly gave in public, in front of total strangers and were unashamed of, are now quickly drying on your face after you tried to wipe them away in embarrassment for shedding them for THAT ending.And that sense of spirit and wonder that a great movie leaves you with long after the lights come up.

I could've built a nest of those in the end;) This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I really refuse to be critical, for once...the pure emotional enjoyment I got from this movie is worth more than technical perfection...The actors and actresses were very good, emotions very believable and the scenery - ahhh, I'm speechless! I love the sea and the power of nature, the sheer power of open waters and howling winds was captured perfectly...goosebumps were the thing of the day, I say. Anyway, I recommend this movie to everyone...you might like it or not, it's really unpredictable, but watching it is worth the time one way or the other, if you won't get anything else from it, you will at least increase your knowledge about one walk of life, you wouldn't know much about otherwise.

It's got comedy, drama, romance and i can truly see it as being based on a true story.The movie is based on something that happens in our everyday life. Coast guards saving people from being taken by the sea. It's something we don't always pay attention to and the movie has opened my eyes to this.The passion that the coast guard (Kevin Costner) shows towards the victims, and how he would go to extremes to save them is something that i admire.Ashton Kuthcer was perfectly chosen for this role.

He soon encounters Ashton Kutcher's character, Jake Fischer, who comes off as a talented but cocky swimmer looking not to save lives but to break Randall's records. They develop a sort of relationship and grow closer and Ben becomes a sort of mentor for Jake. There isn't as much action as one would expect but it gives the movie more depth and allows you to understand the characters more. For the most part, this is a good movie about two men examining their lives deciding what they want and what is best for them. You can see how these two characters change as they get closer. This is the good part of the movie. However, the movie gets really predictable and cheesy in the end and unnecessarily dramatic. If there was a better ending, this would be a really good movie but the totally cliché ending just kills the entire progression of the movie. It should end when Costner retires.",The Guardian
242,bfainjuvct,Surprisingly good,9,6 November 2006,"My wife and I went to see The Guardian at an area theater Friday night. I have to admit, I was rather reluctant to watch a movie with Ashton Kutcher in it. Basically, my only frame of reference for his acting ability was his character on The 70's Show. And, that was not a glowing endorsement for his acting ability in my book. But, the trailers looked great for The Guardian and we decided to sit in on this one.Although it is a remake of the Top Gun genre of movies, it was good. Kevin Costner did a great job as as Senior Chief Randall, the soon-to-be mentor of Airman Fisher (Ashton Kutcher). With similar pasts, even for Fisher's young age, the elder Coast Guard swimmer can see himself in the young recruit.Costner's character is rather unorthodox in his training approach, compared to the status quo of the training facility. But, other instructors soon warm to his style and see its benefits.I do wish they had fleshed out some of the other characters a little bit more, especially Airman Billy Hodge. They did do a little bit with his character toward the latter half of the film, using Chief Skinner. But, not enough for my taste though.However, it was a great movie and I would recommend it to other for viewing. Yes. The 2+ hours is long. But, it keeps you watching the entire time.",The Guardian

I recommend this movie to all audiences,because of its storyline, and the amazing special effect of the ocean.The Guardian finally gives credit to the U.S. Coast Guard, and shows what they go through on a daily basis to keep people safe.

246,wolferj103,Semper Paratus since 1790,10,19 November 2006,"First I would like to say that The Guardian is a very very very long over due biography. I must stat that it IS a biography. It is no way a story. I can tell you this because I have lived this, or at least my father has. I lived in Kodiak Alaska and I know what it feels like to wonder if the rescue crew will even come back alive. My father dedicated 22 years of his life to the Coast Guard. I am however sad to say that he died one month before the movie opened. So I might have been somewhat biased but attending the showing with 9 other Coast Guard families, the movie was very sentimental to all of us. I agree that they may have been some ""cheesy"" lines, but that because they're ""real"" lines and as with everyone who saw the movie might say Ashton Kutcher pulled if off very well. This movie was absolutely amazing in it's actuality to the facts. (Although I do wish that they would have filmed more of the movie in Kodiak instead of Elizabeth City. They could of had the real raging sea instead of a visual effects one) but all in all they did very well. The only thing that I would like to add for people who haven't seen this film is to not think about if like other movies like Top Gun or G.I. Jane, but think of it, like I said, as a biography to those many many men and women who gave their lives to save others, to those who are still prepared to give their lives for others, and those who support them and live their lives wondering if they will lose their loved ones. This movie should not be called or thought of as a story but an epic depiction of the bravest branch of the military, because they are the only ones ready and willing to give their lives to SAVE others and not to KILL others.This movie is by far the best I have seen in years.",The Guardian

This movie includes an excellent cast including current and retired members of the Coast Guard. The realism is there, locations are excellent and it draws you in right from the beginning.

Pretty usual plot. Not too much depth in the plot. One guy gets the girl (Officer and a Gentleman) one guy loses the girl. Same as usual.

However it also draws in the female audience with a great deal of emotion.The film is original which is a high demand for today's generation audience as most films are pretty much the same as before just with 'special features'. The film catches the viewers attention by possibilities that could arise next, which are usually wrong, again proving the statement of its uniquity. If the film is not your cup of tree, one can always easily put their hand and admit their huge appreciation and commitment that has been put forward to the movie.Well acted by Kevin Kostner and Ashton Kutcher, this film has to be nominated for Oscars.

251,blckingu,One of the most underrated films of the year.,10,21 November 2007,"First of all, I'd like to say that I'm probably the last person to give out ten stars. I got and see movies against my better judgment and then end up waisting several hours of my life. I did not want to see this movie. I thought it was just another cheesy military movie(yes I realize it's not about the military, just humor me). My best friend and I intended not to see this but what we came for had been sold-out. So this didn't look appealing. Normally in movies I can guess the entire ending and not be surprised. With this movie, I did guess the ending, as I'm sure most did, but I must admit, I was moved.The directing seemed so real to me. I don't know much about the Coast Guard, but it did seem incredibly believable. The director had camera angles and camera cuts to make you feel like you were someone in the movie, who had just witnessed it as a real event. The acting itself surprised me more than anything else. Costner played a horribly scarred person who just wants to forget all his life's achievements because of a horrible experience that wasn't even his fault. His portrayal is so real, he really makes you think that he's gone through everything. Kutcher was able to overcome his usual pretty-boy movies. He plays a character with depth who also, like Costner, plays a deeply scarred person. Through-out the film, Kutcher shows a man's desire to be the best in everything while trying to forget his traumatic past. Which, unlike Costner was his fault. The chemistry between the two is phenomenal.The other actors were all pretty strong, though most didn't have much character development(which put more emphasis on Kutcher and Costner). There were a few actors who did stand out for me and they were Carl Billings(Omari Hardwick), Clancy Brown(Capt. William Hadley), Shelby Fenner(Cate Lindsay), Dule Hill(Ken Weatherly), and Alex Daniels(WIld Bill).Overall this movie is good. It does have a cheesy love story, but in truth, which movie doesn't? The acting was great. The directing was great. I would seriously give this movie a try, even if your like me and hate those military type movies.",The Guardian
252,tmjtp85,Good,10,13 January 2007,"although this kind of movie may be seen before but Kevin's played well enough to forget all the movie before he is a tough guy!!! it is a moving story, and Kutcher's performance is also awesome. this young guy's gonna be a great star and it reminds me of the mighty coast guard they are the true heroes when you live in this country with feeling of security you should by no means forget what they've done for all the Americans. something is out of my understanding, though. why the scene of losing his crews is always haunting around him? i mean they are professionals, they should not disturbed by such a incident. they should tolerate all this, not to say they will face life and death all year long. but that point may be stupid. it is a good movie, anyway.",The Guardian
253,lookatmenow,Excellent Job by Costner and Kutcher,8,24 January 2007,"This movie seemed to have a short run at the box office, but I wouldn't let that stop you from renting it.For a retired military member as myself, I was happy this film had taken time to show the topic in a base of reality. Too many films often lose authenticity and wind up taking a ""Hollywood"" approach to these types of films.I found the plot and main characters realistic, with Costner and Kutcher both providing solid performances. The casting was also bolstered by using real USCG personnel for several parts within the film. This was a great idea, not so much for realism, which it does, but also in the way it recognizes these individuals who put their lives on the line to save others.I haven't seen Costner give this strong a performance in a drama since ""Dancing with Wolves"" or the ""Body Guard."" For me, in recent years, his best work was in ""Rumor has it."" He was very good in ""Message in a Bottle"" and ""The Upside of Anger,"" but again, for me, I enjoyed this performance more.While there are several other films like this one, it is still a very good movie for taking your sweetie to, or for snuggling on the couch. For the guys, have a beer and enjoy. There are also some very humorous parts where my wife and I laughed out loud.Lastly, this should prove to be a good recruiting film for the Coast Guard. Top Gun was slicker and definitely a better recruiting film, but The Guardian far outclasses the Army's feeble attempt at recruiting when they backed the film ""Firebirds."" Kutcher's part was a bit telegraphed but Ashton gives his character a soul. His quiet but strong demeanor are well suited for the role of Petty Officer Jake Fischer, a talented but tortured Recue Candidate. Melissa Sagemiller and Ashton work well together as boyfriend and girlfriend though the romance was not as involved as Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis in ""Top Gun"".Lastly, this should prove to be a good recruiting film for the Coast Guard. Top Gun was slicker and definitely a better recruiting film, but The Guardian far outclasses the Army's feeble attempt at recruiting when they backed the film ""Firebirds."" Again, this movie is well worth your time. Rent it and enjoy and take time to remember those it pays tribute to.OORAH! Gary Soots, First Sergeant, US Army, Retired",The Guardian
254,tismissykia,Deeply Disappointed With Lack of Character Strength & Length,3,25 January 2007,"I've never been a fan of Costner's but as an ""almost"" USCG with boys who have expressed interest in joining some form of military when they're old enough and if so, I'd prefer they went with the USCG much for the same reasons I considered doing so, I felt it was worth watching with the boys. I was deeply disappointed more so with the lack of Kutcher's acting ability and Ward's lack of character than the predictability Costner would be his usual quiet but brazen self.The film was too long and there were a number of scenes that could have easily made their way to the cutting room floor without being missed or taking away from the already hole-riddled flick. The bar scene with Kutcher and then Kutcher/Costner; a number of the pool scenes many of which I thought was just one clip being shown repeatedly and the bunk scene with the ""Really Big Guy"" all could have been cut.I didn't have that ""oh!"" moment when Costner revealed to the audience the angst Kutcher was burdened with as both severely lacked portraying those more subtle aspects throughout the film. And Ward/Costner's relationship left much to the same wonderment -- just what exactly was the problem? More mystifying was to later learn Ward was a trauma nurse as her whole point, from what I got, for their breakup was because she needed him home more. Why? So he would have to wait for her to come home from her job? It just didn't make sense to me. I felt they made a better brother/sister couple then married.The scene with the officer getting decked by the 3peat was very juvenile and failed to move me or the kids who laughed uproariously making fun of the actors.I'm disheartened the USCG's valiant and often unnoticed work was so miserably portrayed by these lackluster performances. Had Costner spent more time truly understanding the hardships these men and women face and worked to portray them instead of relying upon his one-time-claim-to-fame but long dead talents, this may have been more worthwhile. But then again, Kutcher's performance failed even more, IMHO.",The Guardian
255,pdeoude,Old man & easy watching,6,26 January 2007,"When I watched this movie my first thought was... it that Kevin Costner? Yes, Kevin is becoming an old man and it starting to show too. Anyway, this movie typically falls in the category of easy watching. And often with easy watching movies they are a little predictable. So if you're in for a good movie with a brilliant script this isn't for you. On the other hand, if you want to see a movie that doesn't require much thinking and allows you to sit back and enjoy the ride (if mentor/protégé kind of movie is your thing) you will like it and right after that forget it.With respect to the actors. Kevin is Kevin, and Kutcher... I didn't see Demi Moore's boyfriend acting before, but I'm not really impressed. Although, I think he fits perfectly in easy watching movies.",The Guardian
256,ratanguay,The best movie i've ever seen,10,29 January 2007,"The Guardian was one of the best films of the year, if you ask me. Costner really sold the story. The Guardian was beautifully written and the actors really pulled it off. This film really gave you a glimpse into what life as a Coast Guard is like. I now have an enormous respect for our Coast Guards after seeing this movie. The ending was some-what predictable, but the way it happened wasn't. There were times during he movie i laughed, and at the end, i'll admit i cried. The people in theater were brought to tears at the end as well. I believe that this movie defiantly deserves a few Oscars. I am completely amazed by the people who put this movie down. There were not any ""cheesy"" moments, there were real moments. This movie is NOT ""propoganda to make you joined the forces"", its a movie, it's for entertainment, so GET OVER IT!I realize there were a few mistakes but this movie is not bad. I enjoyed it very much. I thought that it not only delivered a meaningful and powerful message but it was compelling, riveting, and was very entertaining. The relationship between Randall(costner) and Fischer(kutcher) was real, i defiantly bought it. I think that Kevin Costner really brought it up a notch for this film, i extremely enjoyed his character, the way he brought ""Ben"" to life was amazing. Well Done. I also didn't expect Ashton Kutcher to succeed in this, i thought of him as a sitcom actor with moderate talent and that was all. But he really proved himself as an actor. I was surprised to see him in such a serious role, but he pulled it off. Overall, Well done 10-10. This movie was the best in a while and i will most defiantly go out and by the movie.

What is with the mask on the forehead all the time? I can only think it was a movie thing to keep the actor's faces in view. For those non divers/swimmers out there, the last thing in the world you would ever do is take your mask and prop it on your forehead, ESPECIALLY when in pounding waves in the dark next to floating debris. A wave whisks it off your face and then what, not to mention that dunking it in and out of the water will make it steam up inside at the most inopportune time. If it HAS to come off you would always pull it down under your chin to keep from losing it.I sincerely doubt that a rescue swimmer wearing heavy gloves would jump 20 feet out of a helicopter without first having his/her mask in place with the edges properly secured behind the edge of their wetsuit hood. A task not done easily while being flushed around in a washing machine ~g~.I also wish there was some indication of why the Captain in the bar told the Navy guys to ""stand down"".

Repeat: Aston Kutcher is the worst actor alive.Beware recurring themes. Idiasyncratic behavior, that lets you know a character is unique.

I haven't seen this exciting of a movie in years. Although it is a familiar plot, it is one that is played out each day in our different military services. It does bring attention to a part of our Homeland Security force that doesn't get much recognition or thanks. And there is more to these ""warriors"" than the elite swimmers. They are always there for us when we are in need. There are only 35,000 - 39,000 Coasties throughout this country, but they are called upon to not only save lives in danger, but to do ""law enforcement"" and Homeland Security jobs.

And to realize like in the end that there is a time in our lives where we give our lives up just to save people. A hard decision at first but in to serve our country just to give up a life is truly a dedication in my book. I cant wait to watch this again.

An aging Search & Rescue Cost Guard Senior Chief who happens to be the best ever with 300 or so rescues. His character was very detailed & well developed. Ben is dealing with a divorce, aging and a deadly accident which cost his whole team their lives.When Ben is sent to the Coast Guard ""A"" school to train new recruits, he is faced with a young hotshot Jake Fischer(Ashton Kutcher).The story is well written, however, Costner carrier the movie mostly because the were no other characters you cared about. Kutcher does a good job with his part. The only problem is he had no depth. No history. What was his motivation? Records?Neal McDonough was miss-cast as Jack Skinner. He really had nothing to work with, but could have been really good as his good buddy instead of his rival as an instructor.Overall i loved this movie. A story that needed to be told.

268,kmkrame2,"Good Movie, read comments.",8,5 December 2008,"High school all star swimmer Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher) turned down every Ivy League school scholarship to go the U.S. Coast Guard training center to be a rescue swimmer. When he gets to school however, he runs into the top rescue swimmer at the time, Senior Chief Ben Randall (Kevin Costner). Randall does not seem to be as impressed as the other instructors at Jake's speed and agility in the water. Instead he intends to find out just why this all-star swimmer is in the U.S. Coast Guard and not all the prestigious Ivy League schools he was offered scholarships from. As Jake makes his way through school and a new relationship, will he lose his focus and get dismissed, or will Senior Chief Randall uncover the truth behind the cockiness and his true motive for being a rescue swimmer? Director Andrew Davis creates many twists and turns in this movie, from helicopter crashes to bar fights. The events in this movie are highly realistic and show what one can go through to become a rescue swimmer. It shows the good and the bad, happy and sad, and of course, the action. The director of this movie did a very good job at displaying the high seas and the risks involved by having awesome camera angles in the waves, like the rocking boat so it felt like you were on the boat. The set used was very realistic, with the high rolling waves and huge ships in trouble. The main set was the Academy, which was very realistic and could easily pass a real training school. The weather, physical condition of the students, and the rigor of the work, all contributed to portray the school as some sort of Hell. This made the movie more realistic because this was one of the top schools in the Nation, so it should not have been portrayed as a happy place. Davis also showed many different camera angles, both above and below water. The director also uses close ups to portray the emotions of each character and the different ways they are reacting to their surroundings. Another big cinematic element in this film was the flashbacks. Director Andrew Davis uses these flashbacks multiple times throughout the movie to show the effect on the rescuers when they were too late. These flashback sequences are used to show Ben Randall's fear in going back out on the water after a near fatal helicopter crash. Davis portrays how few rescue swimmers there really are. He did a good job portraying the life involved and the discipline needed to achieve being a rescue swimmer by the actions that the rescue swimmers did. They were in freezing water, pushing bricks on the bottom of a pool, restricting the breaths they took. It also shows the burden that is put on your shoulders to save as many as you can, and face that fact that sometimes, you just can't save them all.This was an easy four out of five star movie. The director and the actors did an awesome job in this movie with their emotions and how they displayed their characters in this movie, it caught my attention as a critic. This movie surprised me because I thought it would be another shipwrecked movie about a ship lost at sea. However, this movie proved me wrong about my thoughts and completely surprised me on the action and the very climatic ending. The ending was very thrilling and well thought out. It will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end, so watch out for this next big blockbuster hit.",The Guardian

It hit a little close to home with the SAR cases and always the danger of never coming back, but it was an incredibly moving movie. Ashton and Costner were amazing actors in the movie, and I think it's impressive that they took the time to visit CG stations and see what these men and women really do. As any movie, there were a couple things that were Hollywood-ized, but overall it was very true to the real deal. Four out of five in my immediate family are Coasties (soon to be five out of five once I enter boot camp), and I couldn't be prouder of the job they did on this movie. It opens a lot of people's eyes about the real Coast Guard and what they do, something which I believe is sadly overlooked much too often. ""We're the Coast Guard. No one appreciates us until they need us."" So true. I'm glad to see the Coast Guard get the recognition they so greatly deserve.

It has never been shown that the Coast Guard are the ones that go into the storm when the other branches are ""running"" out of it. It also shows the unfortunately rivalry between the Navy and the Coast Guard. It is so sad that all our branches of service can not work as one team and not compete against each other. They should take a lesson from the 9-11 rivalry which took place between the NY Police Department, Fire Department and EMS Department. This conflict and rivalry got in the way and no doubt caused some lives. How do I know...

The way he captures the emotion his character explores is like the star on a Christmas tree, gorgeous.I never went into this film with expectations of a classic however I was left in awe as I turned off my DVD player and my mind remained blown. Perhaps I am overselling this, but it is arguably my favourite movie of all time. So..Deal with it.Simply brilliant.",The Guardian
278,khamill-1,"That was Terrible, Do not watch this movie!",1,15 October 2006,"That was one of the worst movies of all time. This should go straight to DVD.I was sitting in a cinema hall with around 40 people in it, and the second the movie finished, some guy stood up at the back and shouted ""Thats the biggest lot of Pish I have ever seen."" And the whole place erupted into laughter, don't know how this movie got 6.4/10.Some folk need entertained!That will definitely spell the end (this time) of Kevin Costners acting career. There was points in this movie when the film went into slow motion, as if the actor was in thought, and it was so painful to watch.It was like when those drastic TV movies are on, and the terrible special effects that make you switch channels.WARNING! THIS MOVIE WILL SERIOUSLY RUIN A GOOD Saturday NIGHT AND ROB YOU OF YOUR £6 TICKET FEE!",The Guardian
279,moviefanintheflatlands,It's the best movie I've seen in years.,10,17 September 2006,"We saw the sneak preview Saturday night, Sept 16th. It was really done well; lots of action, humor, and suspense. -like Top Gun and Officer & a Gentleman, but with a lot more action, like The Fugitive. Everyone cheered at the end of the movie. It's certainly going to be a hit this fall. I don't agree that it was too long. 2 hours 15 minutes is about normal and the time flew by anyway. I didn't think anything was predictable either. The Cinematography was top notch too. It makes you want to go to Alaska. I bet that 18-year-olds will be lining up to join the Coast Guard now, just like everyone wanted to join the Navy after Top Gun came out in 1986. But they should. There wasn't any flag-waving here, it was just regular people doing their jobs; heroes.",The Guardian
280,codyfoltz,God Bless the USCG!!!,10,30 September 2006,"This movie is definitely A MUST SEE for all ages alike. The heart of this movie lies not in the cinematography but in the story. The acting, sound design, and special effects all help this movie keep a strong heart beat. This film really shows audiences the trials and tribulations that the men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard go through day in and day out. Kevin and Ashton really bring it all to the table. I thought Ashton was good in 'Butterfly Effect', he is leaps and bounds beyond his acting in 'The Guardian'. The entire film is wonderfully put together and will definitely be one of, if not the best movie I have seen this year so far. I hope all who read will get a chance to see it on the big screen and if not buy the DVD or HDDVD if it gets released on that medium. Happy movie going to all!",The Guardian
281,h00h00dilly,Outstanding!,10,18 September 2006,"Well, the first thing to consider when viewing this film, especially if you're active duty Coast Guard, is that this is a movie - not a documentary. Having said that - this film was excellent. Costner's performance as a salty rescue swimmer was spot-on. Kutcher's performance was perfectly cocky, and surprisingly genuine in an emotional breakdown scene. The supporting cast played their roles nicely, without stealing the show from the stars. Yeah, yeah - it was typical Disney type fare in the character development, and the relationship that unfolds between Costner and Kutcher was predictable. Yet, the ""corny"" factor was kept at a minimum. The writing was witty and believable, with quite a bit of humor sprinkled in. ""The Guardian"" definitely has staying power - and once released on DVD, it will be nestled snugly between ""Top Gun"" and ""The Perfect Storm"" on my shelf-o-movies.",The Guardian
282,ceili123,"Good idea, BAD movie",2,30 September 2006,"This film has the kernel of a really good story. The work of the men and women of the Coast Guard, especially in the North Pacific, is the stuff of heroes and legends. This film mucks up a good story with three endings (none satisfying), a couple of unneeded and pointless bar fights and two alleged ""romantic"" relationships that have as much spark as dead campfire. The rescue scenes are great - even if the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal - but the backstory is lame and disappointing. Costner is good - especially his hand acting (watch for it). Ashton Kutcher is flat but not terrible. The main female characters are one dimensional. The best female is one of the Coast Guard sailors in the rescue center and she's on camera for about two minutes in the whole film. It could have been an excellent film - and Costner needs one!",The Guardian
283,sara_fried301,A wonderful film,9,1 October 2006,"The movie The Guardian was an excellent film which I was very impressed with! I am from Kodiak, AK. The real boys of the USCG rescue swimmers are my heroes they are the ones who go out and save our home boys. My friends and their families are those out their fishing for a living and without the USCG who would save them, i think they did a wonderful job displaying the story. I would like to publicly thank Bob Watson, who i know personally, for going out in the unthinkable weather to rescue our boys! This is a powerful film and everyone should go see it, because that is what the Alaskan waters look like, and it does take lives every year, but thanks to the rescue swimmers it doesn't take all! Thank you!",The Guardian
284,massjazzfan,An Inspirational Film,9,3 March 2017,"I am extremely impressed with this movie, and I feel like it is under-appreciated. This movie is not the fast-paced action movie that we are used to with military films. Instead, this is an inspirational story about overcoming the challenges in one's life. The movie follows the character development of Jake Fischer (Ashton Kutcher) and Ben Randall (Kevin Costner). In the movie, both characters are facing similar struggles, and when they first meet, they are dealing with they're ghosts in different ways. But, together they overcome them and become the heroes that they need to be. I love this movie because it helps to inspire people to become better. These characters are rescue swimmers or training to become rescue swimmers, and they must overcome their own personal struggles to be able to help save others. You gain a deeper appreciation for real life coast guard swimmers. You also feel as if you yourself are able to make a difference in the lives of other people. This movie is a great representation of overcoming one's self to become a person that will make a difference in the lives of others.",The Guardian
285,Rachelx428,This was filmed in my town!,10,4 October 2006,"I come from a small city in NC, Elizabeth City where this movie was filmed. It was crazy to know that we'd be seeing Ashton and Kevin in our little city, where absolutely NOTHING goes on! I think, that whole week, all you'd read about in the newspapers was ""KEVIN & ASHTON IN TOWN."" I never got to see them, unlike all the obsessed fans in town who would stalk them by calling the hotel they were staying at to confirm if they were actually there. It's pretty cool to know that when the movie actually came out, we got it in theaters as well, where as all the other movies that come out, we are always one of the last to get them in out little theater. I haven't seen it yet, but I definitely want to. Being that it was filmed here, I find it more appealing, and Kevin and Ashton: excellent actors! ;)",The Guardian
286,warren-shamburger,An unoriginal film,1,22 September 2006,"Honestly this movie, to me, was comparable to ""Snakes on a Plane"". It seems like a cheesy television show all of the way through. It could be my dis-like of Kutcher (He should be in that 70's show and that's it) that made me not like the movie, or it could have been the long and boring plot. It might have even been the fact that I felt like it told me the exact same story twice in one sitting, and both times it was not good. If you are stupid and go to this movie you will get to see a ""not so good pansy actor"" basically try to impersonate Tom Cruise from his ""Top Gun"" era. The only reason I went was because I had a friend who got 60 sneak preview passes for free from his company (to hand them out.....without charging any money). Do NOT spend money on this movie please.",The Guardian
287,kaylakissesx33,The best Movie i've ever seen.,10,29 January 2007,"The Guardian was the most amazing movie i've seen in years. It was a 10 out of 10. Costner was amazing, he really sold the story, the ending was amazing, sad, but amazing. It shows viewers a glimpse into the life of a U.S Coast Guard and after seeing this movie, it has given me and enormous respect for our Coast Guards. This movie had it all, and really kept the audience interested. After seeing it, the whole theater was in tears. Beautifully written and portrayed. This movie is the best it gets. It is most defiantly Oscar Worthy. I will defiantly By this movie. I can't think of one thing wrong with it. I recommend it to everyone. I can't believe it only rated a 3.5 out of 10. Everyone who says its ""proganda"" to join the Coast guard, is simply delusional and looking for a reason to put down this film. It was compelling and heat felt. It WAS NOT a bad movie. It was an AMAZING ONE.-Kayla, ME",The Guardian
288,paprikka87,"Good, but predictable",9,10 October 2006,"This was a good movie if you love those everyday hero type flicks. It did have some awesome inside looks at coast guard boot camp if you will and if you like those types of movies then you will really love this. However the ending was a strange deja-vu of a scene from the day after tomorrow for me. The whole ""this wont hold us all, so let me valiantly kill myself!!"" Didn't have to happen, really they could have gotten lower let him drop in the water at a good distance and drop another life boat and gone back for him that night, but I guess that just wouldn't have been Hollywood enough now would it? Overall a good movie, lots of testosterone for the guys and eye candy for the girls!",The Guardian
289,bpdmailbox-collegebound,Left a Little Disappointed,7,25 September 2006,"If you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film, I would have told you it was great! However, I left the theatre feeling unsatisfied. After thinking a little about it, I believe the problem was the pace of the ending. I feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow, and then the ending developed very fast. So, I would say the ending left me disappointed.I thought that the characters were well developed. Costner and Kutcher both portrayed their roles very well. Yes! Ashton Kutcher can act! Also, the different relationships between the characters seemed very real. Furthermore,I thought that the different plot lines were well developed. Overall, it was a good movie and I would recommend seeing it.In conclusion: Good Characters, Great Plot, Poorly Written/Edited Ending. Still, Go See It!!!",The Guardian
290,we_rock,It was so touching..,8,18 October 2006,"The movie is so touching. During the part where they where hanging on the rope line and Randall freed himself, I nearly cried. The movie was so inspiring. The visual effects was so real even though they just filmed it in the pool. Attending the Coast guard training may really have this effect on you to be disciplined and concerned. It has a lot of valuable lessons. The pool is so cool. 'GoldFisch' should have done better if he wasn't scared at that moment. Everone knows he scared because one wrong slip might lead to Randall's death. But Randall decided that for himself. All the parts are just very important. The Guardian is also like the movie 'Armageddon' but this is okay. Because if this happens in real life, there's like 75 percent that coast guards can find the body but in outer space? that's harder. way harder.",The Guardian
291,luckystarchick21-1,Great Movie!,9,14 October 2006,"I liked this movie quite a bit. I didn't go in with very high expectations. This movie showed what students had to go through to become Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers. I thought Ashton Kutcher's strongest suit was comedy but, in this film he show's he can be a serious actor. I think after this film people will start to take Kutcher more seriously. Kevin Costner was wonderful in this film. Kutcher and Costner compliment each other in a way. Sela Ward was great in this film as Costner's estranged wife. This film made me laugh and cry. Some of the scenes were were a little cheesy but, nothing to cliché. I would recommend this movie to anybody.",The Guardian
