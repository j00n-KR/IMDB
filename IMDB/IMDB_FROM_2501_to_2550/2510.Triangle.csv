0,Leofwine_draca,Decent stab at a sci-fi thriller,7,15 July 2014,"TRIANGLE is a UK/Australian production of a sci-fi/horror story in which modern-day scream queen Melissa George stars as a woman caught up in a nightmare. There are shades of classic ghost stories along the line of DEATH SHIP when a group of friends find themselves stranded on a seemingly abandoned liner, but soon things take a very different twist.I'm predisposed to enjoy time-loop style stories and I have to say that the low-budget Spanish film TIMECRIMES is by far the best of the bunch. TRIANGLE sometimes reaches the same level of quality - and Christopher Smith's direction has much improved since he made CREEP - but it has too many plot holes and things that don't really make sense to make it a truly exceptional film like TIMECRIMES was. Still, that doesn't stop it being a very entertaining movie.I've been really enjoying George in all of the horror films she's made recently here and she delivers another gutsy turn as a tough woman who has to make the best of her situation. The supporting cast are more than adequate, a particular surprise being Liam Hensworth who makes a good job of a one-dimensional character. The level of tension is high and Smith acquaints himself well with the material, both on a standard slasher front and when getting to grips with the more intellectual sci-fi elements. It may not be perfect, but TRIANGLE sure is a lot of fun.",Triangle
1,SnoopyStyle,fascinating,7,6 March 2019,"A group of people go on a leisurely weekend outing on Greg (Michael Dorman)'s sailboat Triangle. His long-time friend Sally (Rachael Carpani) has brought along her husband Downey and Heather as a setup for Greg. Unbeknownst to her, he's brought along new acquaintance waitress Jess (Melissa George) from the diner which he frequents. She is troubled from a mystery incident with her autistic son Tommy. Rounding out the group is Victor (Liam Hemsworth), a young man Greg is trying to mentor. The boat is hit by a weird storm and capsizes. Heather is missing. They are picked up by old ocean liner Aeolus but the ship appears to be empty.It's a fine horror setup. It's going along fine but it does do a couple of annoying standard tropes. First, the group splits up. Initially, I had great hopes that they wouldn't split up but Victor chases a phantom and people scatter. It's a little disappointing that it does something so standard. It would work better with a better lure. Let me describe it in detail. Victor sees the second Jess and yells out ""Jess!"" before chasing after her. It's the perfect reason for Greg and a confused Jess A to chase after Victor. The chase needs to be frantic which would lead to them scattering. A frantic chase would also heighten the intensity. Second, it takes them way too long to grab a weapon. I thought they would grab something when they couldn't find anybody. I'm not going all paranoia with ghost ship. It could have been pirates holding the passengers hostage somewhere. Greg's excuse that it's all a prank is rather annoying. There is a small middle section which needs more tension. A kinetic chase and grabbing some weapons could do that.This movie does go somewhere fascinating. The Sallys are a great reveal which is set up nicely by the necklaces. There are issues with reason and logic as many of these time looping stories have. It's not a movie that can pass the scrutiny. It is more a loop of visual poetry. It's a fascinating take and the memorable Sallys is more than enough to recommend.",Triangle
2,claudio_carvalho,Intriguing Love-or-Hate Mystery Film in the Style of David Lynch,9,28 August 2010,"In Florida, Jess (Melissa George) is a mother that raises her autistic son Tommy (Joshua McIvor) alone. Her friend Greg (Michael Dorman) invites her to sail in his yacht on Saturday morning with his friends Victor (Liam Hemsworth), Downey (Henry Nixon) and wife Sally (Rachel Carpani) that unexpectedly brings her friend Heather (Emma Lung). While sailing, out of the blue the wind stops and they a surprised by a storm. The yacht capsizes, Heather vanishes in the sea and they see the old passenger vessel Aeolus that stops and they climb the embarkation ladder. When they reach the main deck, they can not find any passenger or crew onboard. Jess has the sensation of déjà vu and sooner they learn that there is someone hunting them down. Further, Jess discovers that the only way to save the group is killing them all.A couple of months ago I saw the trailer of ""Triangle"" and I was looking forward to the release of the DVD. ""Triangle"" is an intriguing love-or- hate film that follows the style of David Lynch, inclusive with a reference to ""Blue Velvet"" with the garden water spray nozzle. The story is excellent and the production is detailed with the 1932 riveted ship as it should be. This is the type of story open to interpretation where the viewer shall enjoy and not seek for an ultimate explanation. This is the third film that I see from Christopher Smith and this promising director is improving his work in each film. Melissa George is excellent as usual and the cast has good performances. Last but not the least, Aeolus was the ruler of the winds in Greek mythology. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Triângulo da Morte"" (""Triangle of the Death"")Note: On 27 Jan 2014, I saw ""Triangle"" again on Blu-Ray and now my vote is nine.The story is based on the the punishment of Sisyphus, condemned to roll an immense rounded rock up a hill, only to watch it roll back down, and to repeat this action forever. One of these days, I was watching the Episode 10 ""Judgment Night"" of the First Season of ""The Twilight Zone"" and immediately made me clear ""Triangle"".Jess is a reckless and abusive single mother that is punished after the car crash where her autistic son and she died, to relive that Saturday forever because of her attitudes. The Reaper (the taxi driver) does not take her to the Final Destination, but leaves her in the limbo (pier) until she becomes a better person in the end of each loop. She had never sailed on the boat when she was alive and the journey of her soul in the boat is part of her punishment.Unfortunately most of the viewers do not understand this movie due to the lack of knowledge in Greek Mythology. But the movie gives a hint when the castaways reach the ship Aeolus.Note: On 03 November 2016, I saw this film again.
Note: On 04 May 2019, I saw this film again.",Triangle
3,nogodnomasters,Another time twist thing,5,18 February 2018,"Let's say you could live your life over again, would you change anything knowing the outcome is going to be a disaster? You would, but who would watch the movie?This movie plays on a theme used in ""Twilight Zone"" episodes and various movies since the 1950's: Where the person sees themselves and integrates their present action to duplicate what has happened in the past. While it was done well in this movie, it didn't stand out as compared to others.Did anyone else notice that Melissa George got augmentations after the movie to pose for the cover? The movie drops the F-bomb a few times, but is not bogged down with swearing. It has killing and blood, but spares us gore.",Triangle
4,kosmasp,why (and how),7,29 September 2009,"Like the 2 comments/commentators before me, I watched this at Frightfest too. While I didn't read anything about the movie too (I like being surprised, either in a good way, or in a bad way), Melissa George, who was surprisingly in London at the Festival, did spoil quite a few things, before the movie started. I was happy when she got off stage, because she might have spoiled quite a bit more.Having said that, I quite like her and the performance she gives in this movie, is quite phenomenal, to say the least. She is the centerpiece and holds the movie together. The problem with the movie or something that people might dislike, is the story and how it unfolds. With a genre movie, that has twists and a special ""story-line"", you always have to be careful.Even 2 years writing didn't eliminate all the questions and contradictions that come up, while the story unfolds. Still the effort is there and thanks to a great leading performance, this is worthwhile.",Triangle
5,Sleepin_Dragon,"A truly great, complex film.",9,26 September 2016,"What an absolute gem of a movie Triangle is, it seemed to go very much under the radar, which was a huge shame, as it really is a clever, intriguing film that crosses several genres, thriller, horror, action etc.A fantastic lead performance from the wonderful Melissa George, she is capable and charismatic enough to add a huge energy into the character, given something different to each 'version' of Jess. She's a brilliant actress.On first watch you come away completely perplexed, but wonderfully entertained, this is a very cleverly crafted movie, which looks so good, and moves along at a great pace. Some hugely powerful imagery, Sally's death scene, and discovery of her 'other' selves is a very haunting moment. I also thought the arrival of the storm looked fantastic too.Considering this was made as it were on the cheap, it's a quality film. 9/10",Triangle
6,gavin6942,"For Fans of Timecrimes, This is a Must-See",7,18 August 2010,"A small boat capsizes in the see and the people aboard must go to a large ship for help. But this ship is empty, with the exception of a lone killer acting out of unexplained motives... and then the plot goes from mundane to bizarre.This film is written and directed by Christopher Smith, who made a few waves with his 2006 film ""Severance"". I think this is really going to be his break-out project, so long as enough people catch it. The plot is intelligent and tight, the directing is masterful, and the cast is kept in line.Melissa George has been praised for this film, and I think that's fair. She has up until now been very second fiddle, and despite good performances in films like ""Amityville Horror"", never really got her due. This film is it -- she is front and center for the entire running time, showing her most anguished character possible.There are few problem with this film. It does run a bit long, but not so long that it's unbearable... the first twenty minutes are bland, but it picks up after that. The biggest problem, which is unfortunate, is that this film was released after ""Timecrimes""... and there are some similarities, even if minor, and critics will jump on this. But, if anything, this made me enjoy the film more rather than less, because it was like reliving the mindbend that ""Timecrimes"" gave me.I completely endorse this film, and strongly recommend it to any horror or suspense fan. You may enjoy the subtle references to ""The Shining"", or simply the interesting and deep plot. And, at least as I write this (August 2010), the film is an instant play on Netflix, so you do not have to go out of your way to find it.",Triangle
7,jboothmillard,Triangle,6,13 December 2010,"I remember seeing a short advert for this film, and then I remembered it was from director Christopher Smith (Creep, Severance), so I was definitely willing to give it a go. Basically Jess (Melissa George) is the single mother of her autistic son Tommy (Joshua McIvor), and with the encouragement of her friend Greg (Michael Dorman) she takes some time off to go sailing. On the yacht, Traingle, going out into the Florida ocean she joins friends Victor (Liam Hemsworth), Downey (Henry Nixon) and his wife Sally (Rachael Carpani), and unexpected arrival Heather (Emma Lung). All of the sudden they get caught in an electrical storm which causes the boat to capsize, and they see an ocean liner coming towards them, which slows down, and they board it. On the old passenger vessel, Aeolus, they all find the main deck and look for anyone, and Jess starts feeling like she has been there before. The ship appears deserted with no crew or passengers aboard, and as they explore strange things start happening, including hearing footsteps and seeing glimpses of someone. Soon enough they realise they are not alone when a masked figure is hunting them down, until Jess is the only one left alive, and then déjà vu sets in when Jess looks over the side. She sees herself and the four friends on top of the capsized Triangle shouting for help just like before, and she hides following them, and does tell one of them that they are danger. All of them are killed once again, and Jess realises she is in a time loop, and it will do so until she is the only one left alive, she also realises that she is the masked figure. She pieces together the mystery and sees the only way to get out of this situation is to mask herself and kill her friends and be thrown in the ocean, by herself, and wake up on the beach. Jess returns home, and repeating scenes near the beginning of the film she sees herself once again with her son, being a bad mother, and disgusted the onlooking Jess kills her past self. Jess decides that she and Tommy should move away, and driving away, with Past Jess in the boot, they make their way out of town. A distraction causes Jess to accidentally crash the car, killing Tommy and flinging the dead body onto the road, Jess survives, and desperate to change things she takes a taxi back to the yacht and do everything all over again. Also starring Jack Taylor as Jack and Bryan Probets as Driver. George was a good female lead, the Groundhog Day mixed with a better Ghost Ship premise does have some good moments, including the many dead bodies of a female victim piled up, I did feel it was slightly overrated, but an inventive horror mystery thriller. Good!",Triangle
8,Woodyanders,Very sly and surprising horror/fantasy thriller,8,2 January 2014,"Troubled Jess (an excellent and convincing performance by Melissa George) and several friends set sail on the open sea on a yacht. Said yacht winds up getting caught in a sudden freak storm in the Bermuda Triangle that wrecks the yacht, thus forcing everyone to board an apparently deserted ocean liner. However, it turns out that there's a masked killer on the ship. Or is there? Writer/director Christopher Smith relates the tricky and engrossing story at a steady pace, takes time to carefully develop the distinctive and believable characters, ably crafts a spooky and unsettling dream-like atmosphere as well as an intriguing aura of perplexing mystery, and builds plenty of nerve-jangling tension. In addition, Smith's script boasts lots of nifty and unexpected twists that ingeniously subvert the basic conventions of your standard supernatural horror shocker by tossing one doozy of a trapped in a constant time loop sci-fi main hook that explores the provocative themes of suppressed guilt and denial with exceptional intelligence and dexterity: The various intricate narrative threads are seamlessly woven into a complex and winding whole which culminates in one hell of a jolting climax that's both poignant and unsettling in equal measure. The uniformly stellar acting by the top-rate casts keeps the movie humming: George clearly dominates the proceedings with her bravura work, with ace support from Michael Dorman as nice guy Greg, Henry Nixon as the jerky Downey, Rachael Carpani as the snippy Sally, Emma Lung as the mousy Heather, and Liam Hemsworth as the hunky Victor. Christian Henson's delicately eerie score further enhances the overall disquieting and disorienting vibe. The sumptuous widescreen cinematography by Robert Humphreys makes the most out of the cramped confines of the claustrophobic primary location. Recommending viewing for those with a taste for more challenging and adventurous out of the ordinary fright fare.",Triangle
9,BA_Harrison,Let's do the time warp again.,8,27 September 2011,"Triangle was an early 80s BBC soap opera set aboard a North Sea ferry; it starred busty ex-Hammer babe Kate O' Mara and is renowned for being absolutely dreadful. This film has nothing at all to do with that series, but it is British and, coincidentally, takes place on board a passenger ship. Aussie actress Melissa George plays Jess, one of a group of people on a yachting trip in the Atlantic who take refuge on a passing ocean liner after their craft is capsized during a sudden storm. Once aboard, the friends discover that the ship is deserted... that is, except for a crazed killer who will not stop until everyone is dead.Melissa George has hardly set the world of horror on fire, her previous genre entries ranging from the fairly good (The Amityville Horror) to the disappointingly mediocre (w Delta z, 30 Days of Night), whilst writer/director Christopher Smith failed to impress me much with his debut feature Creep. However, star George does have a cracking bod and Smith showed a marked improvement with his second film Severance—good enough reasons for me to give Triangle a fair crack of the whip. And I'm glad I did, because this twisty little bugger of a mindf**k is one hell of an entertaining ride.As his strange story unfolds, Smith takes the viewer on a wild Twilight Zone-style trip into a hellish world where time repeatedly loops back on itself, throwing Jess deeper and deeper into a nightmare from which escape seems more and more unlikely. Given too much thought, the film might fall apart in a mess of loose ends and massive plot-holes, but Smith's taut direction keeps the action moving along swiftly enough that one doesn't have time to examine the details—they're having too much fun watching the gory action and trying to figure out what the hell is happening and why? By the end of the film, I'm not sure if I have a satisfactory answer for all that I saw, but I certainly had a great time nevertheless.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Triangle
10,paul_haakonsen,Jaw-dropping thriller...,8,26 January 2010,"I had no idea what this movie was about or what to expect of it. I decided to watch it from seeing the front cover. I thought it was going to be yet another mediocre Bermuda Triangle movies. Boy, was I in for a surprise.This movie is interesting right from the start. Good characters and a good story. Then about halfway through it takes it up a notch and speeds forward. There are some really nice plot twists throughout the movie.I was left with my jaw hanging. Rarely do I find a movie to be having that quality. Once the movie ends, you will have gone ""ahhh, so that was what was going on"". Hmmmm, I am not going to give away any spoilers, just watch the movie.This movie leaves some thoughts for you to chew on once the movie is over. I highly recommend this movie if you are looking for a good thrill ride.Thumbs up on this one!",Triangle
11,Coventry,Donnie Darko boards the Death Ship!,5,31 January 2012,"See, I don't like movies that make me feel stupid. Especially not since I know I'm generally not a stupid person. This kind of movie causes people to claim they absolutely loved it, just to prevent others from accusing he/she didn't understand it. I must say I was rather underwhelmed by ""Triangle"" and don't feel too ashamed to admit it, as I've already seen truckload of movies dealing with time-loops, paradoxes and deliberate continuity gaps, and liked most of them a lot better. I'm a fan and admirer of upcoming top-director Christopher Smith, but after barely two promising debut features (""Creep"", ""Severance""), he perhaps overestimated himself already with this needlessly convoluted and (deliberately?) inconclusive mixture of supernatural mystery and cruel slasher picture. Around here as well as on other websites, I've read quite often that ""Triangle"" is most likely inspired by the sleeper hit ""TimeCrimes"". Personally, I truly beg to differ as this genius Spanish movie is pretty much the only existing proof that stories about time lapses and paradoxes don't necessarily have to be complex and confusing. Strange as it may sound, especially when reading the rather bizarre plot synopsis, ""TimeCrimes"" remains logic and easy to follow at all times. That's not exactly what you could say from ""Triangle"". I'd rather compare this movie with the universally worshiped ""Donnie Darko""; and that's definitely a compliment. That particular movie is also compelling and refreshing, but if you ask fifty different people to summarize, you'll receive fifty different versions. Smith introduces an intriguing principal character in the shape of struggling single mother Jess (stellar performance by Melissa George), creates an ideally isolated and naturally mysterious setting with the abandoned ocean liner in the Bermuda Triangle (always a winner!) and stuffs his scenario with obvious and less obvious references to excellent genre classics. For example, and even though not mentioned in the movie references section, the sequence where the shipwrecked posse sees the grisly ocean liner slowly appearing from behind them is (to me, at least) a beautiful and crystal clear homage to the 1980 cult hit ""Death Ship"". Nice attempt and professionally made, but to me the story remains incomplete and only pseudo-intelligent.",Triangle
12,hitchcockthelegend,Loopy Looper!,8,27 October 2019,"Triangle is written and directed by Christopher Smith. It stars Melissa George, Liam Hemsworth, Michael Dorman, Jack Taylor, Joshua McIvor, Henry Nixon, Emma Lung and Rachael Carpani. Music is by Christian Henson and cinematrography by Robert Humphreys.After their boat is damaged during a weird storm, a group of friends board a drifting ocean liner to find it seemingly deserted. One of the group, Jess (George), has the distinct feeling she has been on the ship before...It at first glance seems to be a standard ghost ship type of film, where a group of pretty people are in serious peril, but this is much more. It proves to be complex piece, one in fact that kind of demands a second viewing to fully appreciate the twisty nuances within. Beautiful photography highlights some of the teasing imagery, which ascentuates the etheral tone to proceedings. Then once the story starts to reveal itself, your undivided attention is sought to fully grasp the deep psychological barbs at work. 8/10",Triangle
13,Theo Robertson,An Intriguing Mess With Emphasis On Mess,6,6 August 2013,"A stressed single mother called Jess is invited by some friends to go on a sailing trip in the Atlantic . Everything goes to plan until a storm capsizes the boat but rescue is on hand as they are picked up by a cruise ship . The survivors of the yacht walk around the ship which seems to be deserted and strange things start happening centered on Jess This is a film by Christopher Smith a director best known for his horror movies . I'm very reluctant to call TRIANGLE a horror film even though it belongs within that genre to a degree . The problem is that it's a film that's very difficult to pigeon hole . I can almost understand but communicating my understanding of it in to words .... well that's the problem It is a thought provoking film and some credit to Smith for putting the story in a very unexpected direction . As soon as the marooned survivors of the capsized yacht are picked up on the cruise ship I instantly expected some maniac whose murdered all the passengers and crew to start picking off the yacht survivors . That's not a million miles away from what does happen but is done entirely differently from what you might be expecting The problem is the more you think about it the more plot holes come to the fore . Certainly TRIANGLE isn't in the same league as MEMENTO or all these other mind bending movies and this is probably why it's not all that well known , probably down to the fact that internal continuity isn't given as much thought as it should be . That said it is involving and the whole premise is left ambiguous and open to interpretation and I can understand . I think . Maybe . Or is it a mess ?",Triangle
14,Scarecrow-88,Triangle,7,2 May 2010,"Triangle is one of those movies where a lead character tries to avert a series of events and, despite all his/her efforts, just contributes to the cycle instead of prevent the inevitable. That's as far as I will go in describing the plot's conundrum for a haunted Melissa George who portrays the mother of an autistic boy, joining a group on an ocean voyage aboard a friend's yacht. They encounter an ominous electrical storm which eventually causes a serious catastrophe toppling the boat and sending the crew overboard. Those that survive this discover an old ship, board it, and find themselves hunted by someone in a mask, trying to kill them with a shot gun. Melissa George is the central focus of a strange scenario where she learns of the identity behind the one wearing the mask and tries various methods to help the others, unable to stop the pattern that seems to continue regardless of whatever she tries. The director/writer Christopher Smith takes the classic Dead of Night(a story that has been the model for plenty of shows and movies who have used it to pit an unfortunate soul in a nightmarish prison never to escape)and updated it with Melissa George in the role of Mervyn Johns. Sure the setting and circumstances are different, but the lead suffers deja vu and is trapped in a fate worse than death, trying to put together how she remembers the ship they board, and why her association with the surroundings is so familiar. I think the greatest asset for Triangle is how George's character is shown in different ways as the film continues..we think we know her then the ending shows us a side of George that causes us to reflect on the killer aboard the Aeolus and how nothing is what it seems. Again, the way Smith unveils the story certainly gripped me, although having seen this kind of story used previously, it didn't necessarily surprise me because Dead of Night used this all the way back in 1945, but I admire the clever way he put this all together. And, I love following around Melissa George for 90 minutes, as she goes through a roller coaster of different emotions, provided with a character and storyline that allows her to prove how underrated an actress she is.",Triangle

16,poolandrews,An unexpected gem of a fantasy horror.,8,28 September 2010,"Triangle is set in Miami where Greg has a yacht named Triangle & starts as he & several friends sat sail for a pleasant journey through the Atlantic Ocean, while enjoying the peace & the views a severe thunder storm hits which the yacht is caught in & is capsized by the fierce weather. A woman named Heather (Emma Lung) is lost at sea but the other's manage to make it back to the capsized Triangle & climb aboard the hull, randomly floating in the Ocean Greg & his friends are amazed to see a huge cruise liner called the Aeolus which they manage to board but initially find the liner mysterious deserted. While wandering around the Aeolus trying to figure out what's going on a masked person show's up & begins shooting everyone, pretty waitress Jess (Melissa George) is the only survivor & manages to push the killer of the side of the liner but then witness herself, Greg & their friends board the Aelous again just like before as she has to witness the death of her friends once more...This British & Australian co-production was written & directed by Christopher Smith & is a film that I had heard of before but never bothered to watch (I could have brought the Blu-ray for a few quid) but when it aired in telly here in the UK I decided to give it a go & I wasn't disappointed, in fact all my expectation were blown out of the water & I actually ended up loving Triangle. Triangle is a hard film to comment on, it's a hard film to pigeonhole as I don't quite think there is another film like it & at a push I would say it's some sort of twisted mix of Groundhog Day (1993) & Ghost Ship (2002). For a start Triangle is something different & surely that in itself has to be welcomed but I also thought the script was terrific as it's gripping, exciting, challenging & simply ingenious as all the jigsaw pieces come together to form the overall puzzle & the ending in particular is very satisfying as all the little throwaway seemingly unimportant moments for the start fit into place & have great meaning. Well they do if you actually pay attention & listen to it, Triangle is not a film you can turn away from for fives minutes to make a coffee or something, so many moments seem trivial at first but are then weaved into the story & end up with great significance. I liked how the events end up affecting each other from different perspectives as they overlap each other, sure there are moments when even I said 'what the hell is going on here?' but I stuck with it & was rewarded with a clever, complex, twisted little fantasy horror thriller that keeps you hooked, intrigued & guessing all the way to the end. Having said all that I firmly believe that triangle is not a film for everyone, I am not sure it would have mass appeal but if your prepared to go along with it, think about it & give it a chance then Triangle comes highly recommended from me.Although never mentioned by name one suspects that the Bermuda Triangle was in the filmmakers thinking here, there are a few moments of abrupt violence including some gory shootings, a slashed throat & a hole is seen in the back of someone's head. The recurring themes, images & ideas in Triangle add up to an eerie feel, while not scary as such Triangle is a little weird & spooky. The cinematography here is very impressive, the shot where the camera start on Greg & his passengers & moves up the mast of the yacht & over it is very cool looking, there is a real sense of isolation & desperation during the Ocena set scenes too.With a supposed budget of about $12,000,000 this wasn't huge budgeted by any means, although set in the US it was filmed entirely in Queensland in Australia. The acting is very good actually, Melkissa George in particular is great as she has to handle several versions of herself through some pretty intense scenes.Triangle is a film that surprised me in more ways than one, for a start the maze like plot is brilliantly thought out & does fit together & will if you pay attention & I found it to be a very rewarding & satisfying film to watch & I was still thinking about it & it's plot & twist's hours later. Easily one of the best films I have seen this year so far, I loved it.",Triangle
17,view_and_review,I'm Done With Time Loops,6,5 February 2016,"I am sick and tired of time loop movies. With the exception of ""Groundhog Day"", ""The Edge of Tomorrow"" and ""Looper"" every time loop movie I've seen repeats the same trend. ""Triangle"", although earlier than others I've watched, just happen to have the misfortune of being the fourth or fifth I've seen in a month.I don't dislike time loop movies because of the acting or the action or even the biggest reason to dislike them: the obvious paradoxes that exist (what came first, what was the initial impetus for all the actions, who was the prime mover, etc.?) The sole reason I'm getting fed up with time loop movies is the sheer ignorance and idiocy of those stuck in the loop.We find that you repeat a loop for one of two reasons: 1.) you intentionally try to repeat the past events (ala Time Crimes and Mine Games).2.) you accidentally repeat the past events (ala every other movie).In both cases there is always enough information for the participant(s) to make a different decision. Usually the person has already experienced something negative from (what he'll realize) something of his own doing. The moment he comes to that realization he should seek to take a completely different course of action.""Triangle"" did offer a little nugget in an attempt to break the mold and it was greatly appreciated. The movie did somewhat separate itself from the other time loop movies out there but just not enough. Time loops are already maddening enough trying to figure out the hows and the whens, the last thing the viewer needs is another question mark in the form of ""why did he do that when he knew that's how it unfolded the first time? Does he think this time will be different?"" It will make you loopy.",Triangle
18,neil-476,Groundhog Day with a vengeance,7,21 October 2009,"On the grounds that I am going to spoiler this movie totally, I'll start with the summary. It is a psychological suspense / mystery / horror with supernatural and possibly science fiction overtones. Of its sort it isn't bad at all (although there are, for sure, unanswered questions at the end), and I quite enjoyed it.I'm now going to reveal the entire plot from start to finish so, if you're likely to want to see it and be surprised by its surprises, STOP READING NOW.Jess (Melissa George) is a single mother to an autistic son. She is invited out sailing with a number of friends, although she seems in a very strange frame of mind. A freak squall capsizes the yacht, but they are picked up by a deserted ocean liner. They are attacked and killed, one by one, by a mystery assailant. Jess is the last one and ends up fighting the assailant who, she discovers, is herself. No sooner has she managed to tip the assailant into the sea then the capsized boat is sighted, she and her friends come on board, and she realises that the cycle is starting again. After trying to break the cycle she realises that it has been going on for quite some time (there is a particularly horrifying revelation which, unfortunately, is given away by the trailer) and that fully embracing her part in it is the only way to get back to her son. On being washed to shore she returns home just before she leaves for the sailing trip. Realising how cruel she is being to her son, she savagely murders her original self, but then crashes her car, killing her son. So, of course, her only way of saving him is to go on the sailing trip...All this is quite good fun and, if it is all taking place in her head because she is a complete nutjob, then fair enough. However, if the events are supposed to be actual, then the sudden squall and deserted ocean liner need some explaining which they never get. More importantly, Jess actually has sequential continuity of memory except when it doesn't suit the plot (this isn't her first time on the liner, yet it seems only vaguely familiar: other times she remembers exactly what happened earlier). This isn't a fatal flaw, but it slightly spoils what is otherwise a fairly well thought out unspooling of similar and repeated events.But overall, this is a fun excursion into the weird.",Triangle

While this is pretty original and comes off as being intelligently-done, that's still a lot to take in. That also manages to make the film pretty bloody with all the different generations getting killed off, and the atmosphere works pretty well as the corridors of the ship are utilized to pretty good effect at times with it's long hallways and cramped rooms providing the perfect cover for the different generations to get picked off in, but overall it's just way too confusing to be anything more than that.Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",Triangle

21,trashgang,excellent,7,9 September 2010,"Christopher Smith, the director of this flick has made a movie that I liked very much. I know the guy from great films like Creep and Severance. Two films that i liked also but here we have something different. Were Creep and Severance were pure straight horrors this one you really have to watch close to understand what is happening. But just like with Creep were I jumped out of the seat once here I jumped twice out of my seat. Nicely done because I am really a horror geek and seen a lot but still he manage to give me goosebumps. I would even dare to compare Triangle with a David Lynch flick, really, I mean once on the cruise ship Jess (Melissa George) reappears again and again, she even sees herself doing things. First I thought it was about the supernatural but it is not. You really have to see it to understand. I can't give away anything of the storyline otherwise you will get it. The fun part is that when the film is over the last shots are in fact the beginning of the movie so you can watch it over and over again. Don't go for a pee or anything else, if you loose one second of it you are lost. Excellent done, I guess we will see more of him (Christopher Smith), funny, I just got Black Death without knowing his last effort. And of course a big hurray for Mellisa George ( Turistas (paradise Lost in the UK), 30 days of night)who gives a great performance. The last that i would say is that this flick really has it for suspense and weirdness but when somebody dies, the blood flows, all in tact.",Triangle
22,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Triangle,10,5 February 2011,"It was just the other weekend that I had watched the Lost at Sea episode of Surviving Disaster (hosted by Cade Cortley), and there was this sense of deja vu in watching the first act of this film, since its six primary characters had embarked on a leisurely sailing expedition of sorts with friends and acquaintances, only for a really sudden and mean electrical storm to catch them offguard, not to mention a vague interception of an SOS distress call, and before you know it, most of the survival skills learnt on television began to be applied by the characters here, though not quite accurately since they were out in the open for some time, until a big black ominous looking cruise ship comes their way of rescue.And that was the beginning of all things that go bump, a long drawn mystery as to why the ship has to be empty and void of any human life save for our motley crew, and other beings who seem adamant in wanting to finish them off. You may think it's a slasher flick with supernatural elements at this point, but that detracts you from what I thought was the brilliance of the story, as it showed hand pretty early, leaving you guess just what is really up the filmmaker's sleeves. For instance, almost all the principal characters save one were gone before the midway mark, and you'd probably worry what else is there in the film to keep it going, as it continues to dwell on repetition and deja vu.The name Christopher Smith may not ring any bells, until perhaps I mention he was responsible for Severance, which ranks up there as one of my personal favourites for its really inventive treatment of a horror-comedy-thriller, one that will make you cringe as much as you laugh our loud. The only element that works against his story here is the kind of paradox similarly shared with genres like time-travel that you have to buy into for it to work, but here it's more of a groundhog day situation with the protagonist, single mom Jess (Melissa George) being caught up in a game of survival and to find a way to get herself out of a rut of a cycle.You see, what I really enjoyed about the film, despite something like this being done to death even by films such as the Matrix trilogy, is that Smith had upped the intensity and complexity without dishing out more than it can handle. Like its title, it's made up of three repeated iterations to get to one full circle, and it is this exploration of each side that makes it really compelling to sit through, as it forces you to perform simultaneous mental gymnastics. Little clues and elements of gore (I hate to say) help keep each iteration fresh, and enabled the story to ultimately be simple and compact to grasp.Melissa George is also at her element to carry this film through, with scream queen experience obtained from a filmography which includes 30 Days of Night and Turistas, putting her in fine position whether it is like a damsel desperately in distress, or able to dig deep within to try and battle her way out, since her character has an emotional anchor in that of her autistic son who needs to be taken care of back home.Triangle requires patience, since it throws your preconceived notions of how such a film can get crafted, with enough red herrings and suspenseful moments thrown your way to keep you engaged and at the edge of your seat. While special effects may set to wow you especially when employed on a big scale to bring you the horrors of open ocean sailing into a storm, it is the curveball that ultimately propels this into something more than above average fare. Recommended!",Triangle
23,HumanoidOfFlesh,"Fantastic concept, unexciting execution.",7,7 March 2010,"Christopher Smith's ""Triangle"" tells the story of an unfortunate and tragic yacht trip.The main characters end up getting caught in a mysterious storm that leaves their boat upturned,but find refuge when a large ominous liner finds its way to them.It's nothing but deja vu for the young woman Jess,who seems to think that she has been in the mysteriously abandoned ship SS Aeolus before...""Triangle"" is a puzzling horror film with several complex twists.It certainly made me think and analyze events.There is a decent amount of gore too.Unfortunately there is not enough suspense for my liking and the ship looks too polished and clean to be scary.Some pretty large plot holes exist and the finale (as visually impressive as it is)is also completely ridiculous.The film is obviously inspired by the myth of Sisyphous.A generous 7 out of 10 for this ambitious effort.",Triangle
24,christopher-underwood,She looks great despite having only the one t-shirt and shorts throughout,7,13 December 2019,"I preferred the beginning and end of this to the rather protracted and repetitive main body. The opening credits have real style and prompt thought of David Lynch as we espy from unusual angles the likes of a revolving garden sprinkler, a lazily pushed lawnmower, an unclean pond and a washing line. At the same time the enigmatic ending promises to make sense of what we have seen with a mix of rescue and disaster on the street. In between a rather protracted tale is told upon some ghost ship where shipwreck survivors come and go and come again. Its not terrible but I wouldn't want to watch it again, except for the fact that leading actress Melissa George works her socks off almost single-handed in an attempt to keep this afloat. She looks great despite having only the one t-shirt and shorts throughout and it is a shame she gets little support from the others.",Triangle
25,siderite,It goes on and on and on...,6,28 December 2010,"A lot of people loved this film, so I guess I just didn't get it. This is what I saw: The mother of an autistic child goes sailing with some random guy and his friends. Everybody notices she's a bit weird, but she looks like Melissa George, so every woman hates her and all the guys like her. Then a storm comes and weird stuff happens. She is trying to piece everything together as she herself behaves more and more erratic in order to force the script to make sense. Against all her efforts, she fails.I mean, yeah, I got the gist of the story, but it had to make some sort of sense, didn't it? Leaving aside the cliché of the group of Americans conditioned to not believe what is right before their eyes, never acting like a group, always splitting up and stuff, you still get the behavior of the main character, which is completely inconsistent!Bottom line: I will write this off as being in the category of ""Oh, she was dead"" or ""oh, it was all in her head"" movies, even if it really wasn't. The feeling is the same for me, though: betrayal for watching something and trying to make sense of it when, by design, it couldn't make any. The atmosphere is good, but there is no background for it.",Triangle
26,KineticSeoul,A lot better thriller than expected,7,17 February 2010,"After the first 20 min on a boat with the characters I would expect to actually care for these guys and girls, but that just wasn't the case. But that is forgivable because some of the characters really don't matter if they are likable or not for the plot. It does has it's horror cliché of the girl that catches onto the danger and the guy who deny it and always make excuses that it's nothing. So the basic plot is this a group of people stranded at sea take shelter on a ship later to find out they are in a worse situation. The whole film is basically deja vu except the pattern changes slightly each time, and it's clever how the patterns intertwine, and twists are actually pretty cool. A great and smart thriller that is really worth checking out. My main complaint though is that there is way too many unanswered question and not in a good way either.7.8/10",Triangle
27,Robert_duder,Low budget mystery that leaves your head spinning in all the right ways,7,30 December 2010,"Inception, Memento, The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, Triangle? These films are intriguing, riveting, clever, with a hint of Science Fiction or the Supernatural, and if it is good enough not only will it keep you guessing and following all the clues but it will insist itself on you that you see it a second time knowing all the parts so that you can see how it unfolds. What is my point? Well Triangle will take you by surprise. What seems like a low budget horror/sci-fi flick that is usually found straight to video shelves is actually an incredibly intelligent, well written and riveting mystery that will blow your mind with the twists and turns throughout. Some very good performances that come almost unexpected round out the film making this a must see low budget film. Anyone who enjoyed the above films (you better have loved Inception given it was one of the best films of 2010) should see this one as something off the beaten path. The film also will leave plenty when all is said and done to talk about, question, and think about which can be frustrating but in this case it is more interesting than frustrating.Melissa George has always been one of my secret favourite actresses. She doesn't get a lot of big roles but she impresses in her roles especially things like Grey's Anatomy, 30 Days of Night, and her favourite role of mine in The Amityville Horror remake which was amazing. In Triangle she is dark and twisted and really gives a solid emotional performance, very believable and keeps you riveted. I also think George is really the one woman show of the film because everyone else, while decent in their roles are truly supporting characters. None of them really stand out on their own merits and maybe that is where the film separates itself from big budget blockbusters...a lack of certain character development. Jack Taylor, Michael Dorman, Henry Nixon, Liam Hemsworth, and Rachael Carpani all do a solid job in their roles but don't do anything memorable.I have not seen anything else by Christopher Smith who wrote and directed Triangle but I expect with an imagination and a solid knack for directing suspense he will most certainly do some great things in the future. I still have to wonder if I have figured out exactly what the film was doing and/or saying but that is part of the beauty of this mystery. There was definitely a danger of being very repetitive but the story is really riveting enough to keep anyone from being bored for a moment. Comparisons to Back To The Future have to be made because this was another film that showed the same circumstance from multiple angles and did so very, very well. There is also some really disturbing well directed scenes involving George's multiple paths in the film. You really have to see it to understand and while the production value and lack of character development keeps this one from being a true hit you won't be disappointed in the intelligence and well made story. 7.5/10",Triangle
28,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Floats your boat.,7,30 May 2020,"Apart from one potentially iffy element, 'Triangle (2009)' stands up to scrutiny remarkably well. Whether or not it completely succeeds at being totally bullet-proof is almost irrelevant anyway; if you want to scrutinise a film at all, it must be doing something right. For the most part, this is an intriguing, engaging and unique mystery-thriller that subverts expectation at almost every turn. Where it falters slightly is actually in its execution, as the dialogue is often clunky, the visuals are sometimes unconvincing and the atmosphere, generally, is relatively generic (and I don't think this is by choice). Until its more interesting elements come into play, it isn't all that effective. However, its less-than-stellar first act is necessary in making its final moments as successful as they are. It could have been refined, of course, but it doesn't dampen the flick's overall result. It's that overall result that sticks with you; it's hard not to smile as things begin to fully come together. In the end, this is a good little movie that's elevated by its distinct, genre-bending central concept. 7/10",Triangle
29,bowmanblue,Takes a few watches,7,12 April 2018,"Okay, this is my third viewing of 'Triangle' (so at least you know I must like it, at least a little!). However, there's a reason it's not up there with my 'most watched' movies of all times. And that's because, despite me enjoying it, I really do have to be in the right sort of mood for a film like this. In short... it's a hard watch. It's a horror film starring Melissa George as a troubled woman who decides to have a - brief - break from her day-to-day life in order to join a few friends on a luxury yacht for a couple of days. Unfortunately, this proves even more dramatic than her home life when the boat capsizes and the party end up managing to just about make it to a cruise liner that - almost literally - appears out of nowhere in order for them to board. If that wasn't creepy enough, their new ship is deserted, or is it?Now, apart from Melissa George (who you may or may not have heard of), there's no real stars to speak of, plus no real budget (the ship and anything largely connected to the ocean around it does look a little 'cheap' in terms of computer-effects, plus gore is hardly a major factor. So, the film can't really sell itself on any of those points. It makes up for its lack of 'obvious' selling points by trying to create a confusing and fearful atmosphere. It's impossible to make any sort of film which 're-uses' chronologically-filmed scenes without mentioning 'Groundhog Day.' I guess there's a very - loose - element of that with 'Triangle' based on how certain parts of the film deliberately repeat themselves, each time revealing a little more of what's happening.  I mention the 'confusing' atmosphere that's created. Well... it's not just the characters on screen who are in the dark regarding what's happening to them, but also us, the viewers. Because of the way the 'supernatural 'element of the story is presented, it's not always clear as to what the threat is (or at least what's causing the threat). This film isn't a simple horror film with a monster running around eating people. It uses various other sources of terror. And it's because of this that many people may find the plot a little confusing. I have to confess that I did on my first viewing and even resorted to posting theories on internet message boards in order to check that I knew what was going on. It's one of those situations that once it's been explained to you it's kind of obvious and you kick yourself for not getting it first time round. However, like I say, there are times when you don't want the film's narrative 'spoon fed' to you and 'Triangle' will give you the opportunity to have think about what's happening, why and if there's a way out of what - I guess - is technically the (Bermuda?) 'Triangle.'",Triangle

I would thought that the whole confusion would be over in the end but instead, it was the same from her life at home, being on the yacht to boarding the Titanic-like ship.In some of the scenes, it does remind you of horror movies such as ""The Shining"" or ""Nightmare in Elm Street"". We still haven't found out who the culprit was in messing up Jess' brain and of course, it messes our brains too if you are looking at this for the first time!I was surprised to see Liam Hemsworth as a supporting actor, I really think he could've been one of the leads too.

33,sol-,Death Ship,7,12 August 2017,"It might sound a lot like 'Death Ship' as a group of stranded yacht passengers board a mysterious, abandoned ocean liner where they fall victim to a mysterious presence, however, with an unexpected science fiction twist, this is a far creepier and more unsettling film. This is one of those movies that is difficult to discuss without ruining a fresh experience, but suffice it to say that the project is very cleverly shot and edited to complement the science fiction concept; there is a particularly great moment in which the camera only slowly reveals the faces of everyone on board another yacht that our heroine watches approaches the ship. Some aspects of the plot do not necessarily add up with heroine Melissa George actively avoiding contact with certain individuals (when doing so would have helped her situation) but George's helplessness is actually very pivotal to the plot, given all the resentment and worry that she expresses throughout towards her autistic child who she has left behind in order to join her friends on the voyage. Likewise, an amnesia element does not really click, but it works well along the lines of an inner demons theme, trying to forget past mistakes, etc. Regardless of what one makes of the film though, it is both a thought-provoking and undeniably thrilling experience with several moments that send a real chill down the spine.",Triangle
34,johnnyboyz,"Bouyed by an interesting idea and good execution, Triangle is the 'haunted' locale set slasher film that's actually worth seeing.",7,13 May 2013,"Triangle offers a neat spin on the slasher genre, the film of that ilk wherein its villain doesn't know that that's what they are and when the time comes for them to realise that's exactly what they are, they do their best to try and stop it. It's hard not to like a film like Christopher Smith's effort here, an ingenuitive film that carries all the usual blood, violence and blunt terror of a situation but tries something a little different to your more standard fare with its narrative approach and varying twists and ideas. Crucially, Triangle goes out of its way to encompass a fair degree of mystery on top of its horror; a film asking us to stay alert, if not because we fear being caught off guard with the 'jumps', but because its interweaving and potentially plot-hole ridden wake of bodies; revelations and repetition is a pleasant headache one imagines the writer of the piece may have suffered over and over, lest we suffer as well. In this sense, and comparing it to recent horror fare, anybody who came away from Mikael Håfström's 2007 film ""1408"" having enjoyed it might get something out of this, as nifty concepts and often gripping scenarios with their own sordid dynamics play out.Melissa George plays Jess, a young Australian single mother with a troubled son who causes her to remain on edge just that tiny bit more. The suggestion that Jess' constant taking care of her son might lead to a psychological breaking point is inferred, an autistic boy who needs a lot of attention and keeps life tough for our lead. George will come to do a fantastic job in the role of Jess, a lead role in a film which is running on this wholly original, wholly disorientating idea anyway; George, amidst the madness, is a solid and consistent presence – recurring on screen where everything else is in the form of reality falling apart and things threaten to alienate viewers completely. She pulls off the required reactions, strained expressions and conveys the necessary emotions at the varying times of a tale which takes a human being through the full repertoire of confusion; fear; grief and anger.Jess' plan at the beginning of a day not seemingly different to any other is to go out on a friend's yacht with some other accomplices once her son has been dropped off at school. Resisting the ""Donkey Punch"" approach to things, in turn putting said 2008 effort to shame in its attempt to build up atmosphere; provide thrills and spills, as well as keep everything confined to the middle of the sea on board a boat, the half a dozen or so characters that include Jess cruise around under the sun and with nary a soul for miles. There's a nasty, burning feeling during these fleeting scenes; a sense that we're at sea on a boat and the film is entitled ""Triangle"" and when those things are placed together in our minds, we come up with the Bermuda Triangle, an item rich in mystery and death; an urban legend as it were, a space destined to lead sailors and whatnot to their dooms. At an early point when the film is yet to play its full hand, director Smith keeps things ticking over.Disaster does strike when a huge storm arrives mere minutes before a large ocean liner. Capsized and in desperate need of help, Jess and the crew frantically try to alert the seemingly lone presence on board which has apparently arrived in the nick of time. On board, Smith pays homage to The Shining's Overlook Hotel on top of something like House on Haunted Hill's Asylum and Ghost Ship's....ship - the evocation of Kubrick's ""shining"" extends far enough to a room on-board this boat wherein all the nasty stuff happens numbered ""237"". The liner ends up being quite luxurious, bathed in a hauntingly artificial retro look when it isn't merely steps leading up to other decks; compact corridors and steam rooms. Where help appears vacant, things take a nastier turn when Jess' friends turn up either dead or blood splattered; accusing her of instigating the grizzly violence. Gradually, we witness her piece together a mystery involving the repetition of time when she herself observes herself and her own friends on-board that capsized yacht out at sea.It's here we question as to whether Jess is under too much stress; losing her mind or just facing something more sinister, something plaguing the film throughout. The film isn't really about mental health or as such, it's heart is with delivering an exploitation film moreso a contemplative one; but to write it off as exploitation feels like an injustice and a lot of this is down to how much better it is when lined up against Smith's two previous efforts in Severance and Creep, B-movie experiments which didn't quite come off. There is an eerily beautiful 'look' to the film, a colourful palette of colours that baths the screen in a close to artificial aesthetic. The film carries with it some quite remarkable shots, some startling compositions and a wonderful depth of imagery extending to piles of dead birds and bodies which have no reason at all to be there, yet have a plausible enough reason to be so when tracking back through the chain of events. In terms of pure, raw power and ability to ask its audience to work with the film's intrinsic attitude to constructive horror film-making, Triangle deserves all the praise it gets where a lot of other inferior horrors deserve all the criticisms they get.",Triangle

However, it goes further: beyond the wreck, this film transcends the barrier of the reason presenting us a terrifying and totally illogical situation: the successive and countless repetition of situations, where the characters come forced to interact with alter-egos of themselves without any explanation for that. While the idea itself is very original, turns out to be bad because it was exploited without the audience understands why. The disheartened and ignored audience reaches the end of the film without understanding anything, without a decent explanation for the facts at the heart of the plot and not even knowing who is who, or if the characters are alive, dead or ever existed.

Please do not make the mistake of going into this presuming you will be scared...you won't be. What we are presented with is a mystery thriller that intelligently utilises a gimmick and Greek mythology to convey a subtle metaphor. A single mother with an autistic son joins a group of friends on a boating trip. A vicious storm forces them to abandon their yacht and board a seemingly derelict ocean liner titled Aeolus, convinced that an ominous individual is stalking them. Those of you into their Greek myths (like me) saw the name Aeolus and conjured up an inkling as to where the plot was heading. Others well, let me warn you, this film will leave you head scratching until you have no hair left. Let's get the basics out of the way first. Melissa George was fantastic portraying multiple incarnations of herself, Smith's direction evoked claustrophobia and isolation and the plot itself was carefully constructed. I have to admire the sheer ingenuity and meticulous plotting involved in crafting such a complex narrative. Despite an utterly watchable thriller, I have problems with this film. As a ""plot hound"" I couldn't help but sniff out numerous plot holes that unfortunately detract from what is a succinct narrative. It poses so many questions, for instance, ""Who is putting objects such as the axe back in its original position?"". I understand the purpose of the gimmick, it metaphorically portrays the frustrating routinely basis of dealing with an autistic child. When even trying to disrupt an iteration results in more damage, but the entire plot construct felt too illogical that it left me scribbling a timeline on a notepad instead of enjoying what is being shown onscreen. Then the third act tries to explain itself and becomes all too convoluted, I did appreciate the ambiguous ending though.

Both aspects are very well done and Melissa George shines in her role. She plays Jess, a single mother of an autistic boy who is out for a day on the ocean with some friends. The rest of the cast do a great job as well but it's George who has center stage since the film really revolves around her. She slowly becomes more and more unhinged as the movie progresses and the group is put in more danger aboard the ocean liner.The funny thing about Triangle is when you think it's over, it keeps hitting you with more crazy WTF. Suffice it to say Triangle is the one of those films that had me Wikipedia-ing, Googling and IMDB-ing after I saw it. I enjoyed the movie but wanted to understand it completely.I like seeing those films that makes you think minutes, hours, days and months after you've seen it. Triangle does just that. It's definitely going to make my Top 10 List. 9/10",Triangle

Finding a convenient passing cruise liner, they go on board to find it empty and Melissa appears to recognise the place and soon finds her missing house keys there.You can't comment much on this film without giving a lot away. Once what's going on becomes clear though the film progresses at breakneck speed and is on the whole inventive and rather enjoyable. It is unsettling rather than scary but the director has captured a few impressive images along the route and overall this is fun thriller / horror story.",Triangle
43,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Brilliant mind bender,9,11 July 2016,"Structured like a labyrinthine video game. Packed with loads of paranoid suspense and style. Tuned with the hazy thick atmosphere of a bad dream. A diabolical guessing game from scene to scene. Triangle is one of the most enjoyable mind benders out there, a funhouse of a thriller that sails into murky metaphysical water and doesn't let either it's protagonist or its audience off with a cheap resolution. Imagine Dead Calm crossed with Memento and you'll begin to have some notion as to where this film will take you. It's a freaky voyage, as star Melissa George finds out after a yachting expedition with friends hits a nasty patch of storm weather. Soon a massive, deserted ocean liner crosses their path, and they are forced to board it after the typhoon wreaks their smaller craft. The rest of her crew just seemed puzzled by the derelict vessel, but Melissa has an eerie, gnawing feeling that she's been on this boat before, a feeling that something is very wrong. Suddenly there's a mystery person hunting and killing them, and if I just made it sound like a run of the mill slasher flick, please be assured that it's anything but. What I've described happens in what is maybe the first quarter of the film, and everything after that point is a trip into a dizzy, seafaring twilight zone of psychological mystery and reality warping uncertainty that makes George unsure if anything, including her own perception of reality, can be trusted. Events repeat themselves, characters dart in and out of the wormhole of a narrative arbitrarily yet with a hidden purpouse that managed to scarily elude me for much of the film. It's scary in the way that ducks usual horror trends. There's violence and even some ghastly gore, but the real fear here lies in the unknown, the idea that forces beyond what we perceive as reality are messing around with us, and indeed they do mess around with her and then some, right up until the last frame of an ending that's commendable, haunting and difficult to process. George makes great work of the confusion that morphs into terror and then outright existential panic, keeping us on our toes with the way she handles her character arc. Keep an eye out for a young Liam Hemsworth too. For psychological thrillers, it don't get much better than this, and it's off the radar enough that you'll be able to recommend it to your friends who chances are, haven't even heard of it.",Triangle
44,drownnnsoda,Engrossing mindbender showcases George's acting chops,7,19 March 2015,"An apathetic mother (Melissa George) struggling with her autistic son takes a trip with some friends off the coast of Florida for a sailing trip over the weekend. When they are forced to abandon their ship, they board a mysterious ocean liner that appears to be in pristine condition, but is entirely empty. There are some strange things on the boat, however— a hooded villain, piles of bodies, and the fact that incidents seem to be repeating themselves endlessly are just a few.This slick thriller written and directed by Christopher Smith is quite a surprise, especially given the fact that it only got a minuscule home video release in North America, which is usually a hallmark of schlocky B-horror flicks. Don't be fooled though; ""Triangle"" is not one of those.Though it starts out much like the post-millennial seabound horror flick ""Ghost Ship,"" ""Triangle"" tackles fresh territory as George's character is plunged into an apparent purgatory in which she is helplessly entrapped in an endless time loop. Cribbed from the story of Sisyphus (the film directly addresses its inspirations from Greek mythology— the sea liner is aptly named Aeolus), the film captures the essence of our worst nightmares as time and space seem to close in on our lead character. Melissa George is fantastic in the role, evoking the character's disorientation and a genuine madness; we feel for her in spite of her character's unforgivable sins. Sophisticated editing and cinematography provide stylistic flair that goes hand-in-hand with the main themes here. In the end, the most compelling thing about the film is that, while it points to possible explanations for its disorienting and ever-increasing diminution, there is an open-endedness that is satisfying in that it ceases to put our fears at ease when all is said and done.Overall, ""Triangle"" is a compelling Rubik's cube of a film— a mind-bender of solid production values, meticulous plotting and editing, and believable performances. While there may be an occasional plot hole present, the narrowing effect as the film propels itself toward the finale is too engrossing and gut-twisting for us to notice anything else. 7/10.",Triangle

46,jfgibson73,More Of A Logic Puzzle Than A Piece Of Entertainment,5,18 May 2014,"This movie is the equivalent of those puzzle books on sale at grocery store registers. You won't sit back and passively watch; you will be working on figuring out how one moment connects to the next. After watching, I needed to read some interpretations, along with what was known from director interviews and commentaries. From the moment that Sally explains about the Sisyphus punishment, I suspected what was going on, but hoped there was more to it. Now, my interpretation is that the main character, Jess, is in her own punishment, a never-ending hell of looping through the same agonizing events of a doomed boat trip. As a horror movie, this was much more effective for me than probably 95% of the other scary movies out there. The thought of being in such a miserable cycle is much more terrifying than any backwoods slasher. Visually, the most effective shot was the pile of dead Sallys; other than that, it's pretty minimalist, although it's obvious a lot of planning went into this film. For the reviewers who are writing that this movie seems thrown together or hastily written, you are just revealing how little you understand about visual media. The setting adds to the feeling of oppression, the huge freighter being an especially horrible looking place to be. I didn't necessarily enjoy this movie, or feel satisfied by the payoff, but it made me think a lot about what I'd watched. I believe it was well crafted, I am sure I will remember it for a long time, whether I want to or not.",Triangle
47,ptb-8,Not The Last Of Sheilas,8,30 April 2010,"TRIANGLE for me is a terrific time loop scifi horror set aboard a marauding art deco luxury liner. And as much as I detest Friday 13TH and its kind I found TRIANGLE to be a compelling and shocking and utterly mesmerizing experience. The whole idea of the time-shifting and the unbreakable cycle and how the events layer upon each other, different angles of witness, assisting the friends who are doomed anyway, the scary deserted luxury liner, and the horror of her treatment of her son...all add up to a very clever and ingenious Australian made thriller. If you combine GROUNDHOG DAY with GHOST SHIP you will get an idea of the construct. TRIANGLE has a terrific CGI storm, some creepy Oceanliner imagery and delivers some real jump shocks. I am amazed at the bad reviews and am very disappointed if this film does not reach its audience. BUT here in Sydney it is released on one screen with the most stupid advertising imaginable: an axe murderer stalking Melissa George. Wow if a film's marketing imagery could be more off putting I have yet to see it this side of HOSTEL 2 and any Friday THIRTEENTH junk which TRIANGLE certainly is not. Fortunately I took a chance suspecting TRIANGLE might just be better than its ad sell and I was right. Go see TRIANGLE and ignore the bad reviews and the stupid ads and posters.",Triangle
48,I_Ailurophile,More than first meets the eye,8,6 June 2021,"I was going to begin this review by saying that while 'Triangle' isn't abjectly bad, only an audience appreciative of less than stellar movies is going to enjoy this to any degree. But this is a purposefully tricksy picture. VIewers who stick with it are going to be pleasantly surprised.From the start Christopher Smith's writing is less than nuanced, and his bent as director is much the same. Whether one is talking about the dialogue, or the depiction of events generally, the feature initially impresses us as blunt and direct. A yacht capsizes in a freak storm, and an empty ocean liner appears out of nowhere. The party discovers the name of that ocean liner, and go off on an apparent tangent about Greek mythology. These things happen not because they make obvious narrative sense, but just because it's what the screenplay demands. Case in point, consider the following extraneous bit of conversation:""I know guys that work on ships like this, you know. They see us, they get bored, they're just letting off some steam.""
""What? They rescue us from the sea and they just hide for fun?""
""Yeah.""One could be forgiven for very quickly deciding that 'Triangle' is just a hunk of baloney, an altogether rotten feature undeserving out attention. Yet unsubtle as it is on the surface, there's an intelligence here worth sticking around for. As dubious as the first 40 minutes are, it's only the beginning. Smith arranges some eye-catching shots, and has a sense for lighting that helps to build atmosphere. The forcefulness of the most pointedly straightforward scenes belies a narrative that's more twisted and engaging than the movie lets on at first. The genre at hand here is ultimately familiar, but 'Triangle' keeps us watching, and is sufficiently different in its thrust that it's actually pretty worthwhile.That's not to say that it's perfect. No one is going to mistake this for a great masterpiece of cinema. An early bit of dialogue actually holds the key to the entirety of the plot, but it is inserted so unnaturally, so ham-fistedly, that it seems like a throwaway line right up until the very end. Employment in a narrative of the bootstrap paradox is always thorny, and in 'Triangle' it threatens our suspension of disbelief. There remain some details of the plot that are not explained or explored to my satisfaction, if at all.Still, while flawed and imperfect, this movie has surprised me. There is some immediately arresting imagery within a story that plays with a deceptively complex set of ideas, and in the end it's executed quite well. 'Triangle,' I'm pleased to say, is well worth checking out if one has the opportunity.",Triangle

50,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Triangle (2009),6,30 December 2011,"Triangle is a very interesting and worthwhile film. Until it starts repeating itself at nausea. It builds up nice and slow, something that a lot of films are failing to do these days. Something is obviously not quite right before the cast even set-off. Once a deserted ghost ship enters the picture, it all questions and mysteries. The film is very similar to others out there, such as Timecrimes. Once you get the gist of it, you pretty much know how it's going to unfold. It's still a very interesting idea, and is very intriguing to watch. There is some very powerful imagery, such as a large pile of bodies, with a bit twist to them. Certainly a great watch for a bit of suspense and mystery, and it doesn't try and fry your brain too much either.",Triangle
51,aimless-46,A Nice Mix,9,24 July 2010,"If you like Melissa George then 2009's ""Triangle"" is a must see. She is on screen for about 90% of this 99-minute psychological horror feature. By far her most challenging role to date; she gets a lot of tight close-ups, a number of action sequences, and a character that is all over the map emotionally (must have been exhausting). The entire feature is told from her character's point-of-view (POV); and she does a good job of getting viewers to identify with her character.Basically the story is weird mix of ""Ghost Ship"" (2002); ""The Butterfly Effect"" (2004), and ""Groundhog Day"" (1993); with a little bit of Julianne Moore's ""Freedomland"" (2006) thrown in for good measure. Even the POV twist was done recently in the Spanish film ""Timecrimes""; although here it is more central to the plot.But what makes the cobbled together mix of other movie elements special is more than the way they are mixed together or its intriguing POV twist. It is the introduction of Greek mythology as the story's primary thematic element. Specifically it is a retelling of the myth of Sisyphus, a man the gods had condemned to a hell of ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, at which time it would roll back to the bottom. The Gods had it in for Sisyphus who had been able to cheat death for a period through a deception. They thought with some justification that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor. There has been a long debate about whether it would have been better or worse for Sisyphus to know in advance that the rock was simply going to roll back down each time. Most jobs require a worker to spend their career at the same tasks, a fate just as absurd, but only tragic when they become conscious of the fact. Many believe that Sisyphus surmounts his fate by scorning it. The concept has been extensively examined by existential thinkers.Jess, George's character, is busy processing her fate during each cycle but just as she is almost fully clued in she goes to sleep and loses all but a vague sense of déjà vu about her surroundings.My ""speculative"" read on the story is that the process started when she killed her autistic son in a moment of frustration. Regretting her act she made a bargain with death (symbolized by the sea gulls that appear at various times in the film). She will give up her life in exchange for being allowed to go back to the moment of her son's murder and prevent it. But after preventing the murder she tries to renege on the agreement, driving away with her son. Death then subjects her to a punishment in the tradition of Sisyphus.This is a relatively low budget film ($12 Million) in which almost all the budget makes in onto the screen. There is excellent production design throughout the film and just enough special effects to complement the storyline without calling attention to themselves. Likewise there is enough gore to meet the genre's quota but not so much that it distracts for the basic story.It is all about point-of-view and a good example for film students of the power this device can bring to a film if used effectively. Even if the story is not your ""cup of tea"", the film is worthwhile viewing just to expand your understanding of how to read films.Finally, there is a subtle but pervasive homage to Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" (1980). Not just the #237 on Jess's house and on the liner's stateroom door (this was the number of the haunted room in the Overlook Hotel) but the whole tone of the production; where the main set is actually more creepy because it is not dilapidated.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",Triangle

""Triangle"" is probably inspired by ""Ghost Ship"" and some scenes remember ""The Shining"", and thought both of these weren't that good, this one is even worse.The film reaches a point that you don't care about anyone else and in the end you'll ask yourself what kind of person states this movie is a ""intelligent thriller"".

Bad dreams make you think you've seen things that you haven't."" Triangle is a very good movie about Melissa George's perfect legs, and how they...wait, let me try this again. Triangle is actually an effective, intelligent, layered horror/thriller (starring Melissa George's perfect legs). I can't go into the story very much, as there's not much detail that can be given out with ruining it. I'll just say that a curiously detached young mother and a group of people go out sailing one gorgeous day, get caught in a storm, and find themselves shipwrecked. A massive approaching ocean liner appears to bring salvation, but once they're on-board, it seems strangely deserted. Soon people start dying, and the plot takes a sharp left turn that puts it at a cut above the typical slasher flick that Triangle seems to be at first glance. I'll admit that I was a little underwhelmed by the movie at first, but it definitely gets much better as it goes along. I really have to give the movie credit for how clever and ambitious it attempts (and succeeds) to be. The best description of Triangle I can give without ruining anything is a combination of The Shining and Donnie Darko, with a really hot lead actress. It's mind-bending in just the right way. There were lots of different points that the story could have fallen apart and stopped making sense, but that never happened. By the end, there are no loose ends. And I'll add that the title is particularly meaningful. If you're open-minded, attentive, and ready for something slightly different, chances are that you'll love this movie. I certainly enjoyed it.",Triangle

55,MartianOctocretr5,Time paradox that confounds its own script writer,4,18 September 2011,"Starts off intriguing enough, with a definite Twilight Zone edginess and feel to it. The problem with this movie is ironic, almost in a comical sense: one of the characters is haunted (literally and figuratively) by feelings of deja vous. The audience feels a parallel recognition of familiarity, in that so many movies have been down this road before. It's very predictable after the movie plays its first time paradox card, and then heaps dozens of them in endless succession to the extent you begin to say, ""Ok, we get it; time loop paradox, now get to the point."" It manifests itself as a sci-fi at that outset; the audience is given some promise of a fresh story and sweetens itself with some oldy-but-goody horror/sci fi elements: ghost ship, insane killer, Bermuda Triangle, etc., but the twist at the end is definitely dripping with horror genre angst and ugly pessimism. It's quite obvious what the identity of the mysterious passenger is, and really none of the characters are all that likable;, especially the lead who is clearly an idiot with some contrived issues.The film tries to hard at its Groundhog Day rewinding of a few minutes of time, that it soon outsmarts itself with lapses in logic that not only look foolish, but irritate the viewer that has long since ""gotten it,"" and sees what's coming. Continuing to watch, the futility of hoping you were wrong is again and again thrust in your face. I love the ""collected"" object scenes: please explain this, scriptwriters, as these defy themselves, and beat the story's own premise to death.The only thing it's got going for it is relatively decent acting, but the film way overstays its welcome. The ""twist"" at the end is about as original as corruption in politics.",Triangle

57,oneguyrambling,This low budget Inception-esque flick needs more love.,8,8 April 2011,"Triangle is an English / Australian collaboration filmed in Australia and set in America...Still with me? Regardless of that the film is bloody good fun and at times is a real head scratcher - in a good way.I have read a couple of reviews for Triangle which dwelt altogether too much on the plausibility of the plot, this is most definitely a case of forget what is behind the premise and just enjoy the ride, because at times even though you might not totally understand what the hell is going on you sure as hell can't say that the film doesn't try to be interesting.And come on: Inception made more than a lazy half billion. Try to get the average Joe to explain the ins and outs of that one to you.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: As you may guess this is not an average film, it deals with extraordinary events and circumstances and in reality it is hard for me to explain the plot without starting to give things away or talk in circles.What I can say is that at the start of the film Jess (Melissa George) and three other people are boarding a luxury yacht named Triangle owned by Greg. A young bloke that Greg has taken under his wing is the sole crew member - everyone else is along for the lark of it.A digression here - who in their right mind would name a boat Triangle if they knew of a certain area near Bermuda? Moving on...Jess is a slightly run down full time single Mum, part time waitress whose son Tommy is autistic. Greg has invited her along for the day to give her some ""time off"" - and probably try to get in her pants (only being honest, Melissa George isn't too shabby even when exhausted).So the 6 set off for a bit of a jaunt on the open ocean.Only shortly after setting sail a freak electrical storm brews up as if from nowhere and starts heading towards the yacht. A frantic SOS call comes in but at the time the Triangle has issues of their own, but despite their best efforts the ship capsizes and a passenger is lost.Shortly after a miracle occurs, out of nowhere a vast luxury liner called the Aeolus appears on the horizon and the survivors scramble aboard.Jess instantly feels that the ship is somehow familiar...And...And...And I've said too much! What ensues can't be simply described, nor would it be fair to try in any case, but this is no Castaway or Titanic clone.What Triangle is, is at times indescribable. The plot moves so swiftly and makes no effort to slow down to let you gather your thoughts so you are constantly trying to put together the pieces to come up with a logical explanation just as things take another U turn.There are a couple of twists and turns that will make your jaw drop - or at least mine did - and I grinned a few times at the sheer audacity of the filmmakers to even think that they could pull all this off.All I would suggest is that you give Triangle a chance, it might not make a zack of sense if you really think about it - but then maybe you were thinking too hard about unnecessary stuff instead of having fun with a creative movie.Final Rating - 8 / 10. An original and compelling low budget flick. A great central performance from an increasingly frazzled Melissa George and one of the loopiest plots in recent years. Triangle is a fun film.",Triangle

I would say Triangle holds your attention till the end but is strictly one-time watch.Strange events occurs to the passengers of an yacht when they board a desolated ship due to mysterious weather condition only to witness greater havoc on board.Newbie director Christopher Smith chooses an unconventional script and story to tell and partly succeeds. The movie initiates with weird dream encountered by the protagonist which actually has a story behind. The interesting part begins when the passengers boards the ship and each one is murdered ruthlessly. Here the movie embarks on a different note and will keep you tight. The second half is good but not great when the actual twist is revealed which could be appropriately handled. Nevertheless, the film does have enough charm to engage you.

59,hnt_dnl,Incredibly meticulous thriller!,9,10 February 2010,"TRIANGLE is an amazing film that, upon first viewing, I found myself actually understanding a lot of it! Generally, it's actually not the most confusing mystery-mindbender I've ever watched. But I think that's an actual plus, because it means that the director knew what he was doing all along! A lot of times, when a film presents itself as confusing and ambiguous, that just means that the director did NOT know what he/she was doing, ran out of ideas, and just made up stuff that didn't make sense to complete the film. Yet it definitely requires repeat viewing to try to grab ALL of the intricacies and smallest of details to understand the boat scenes on a purely objective, logical level. The star and central actor Melissa George delivers a stunning, brilliant performance. I've seen her in several things before this (ALIAS, IN TREATMENT, etc), and she had never impressed me as being a great actress, but TRIANGLE has changed my mind in a big way about her! I always thought she was lacking in some way in relaying true emotion to the viewer and was just a pretty face in all her previous roles. She's still a pretty face, but behind that is a talented actor! George totally carries this film. Interestingly, none of the other actors leave a big impression, but this is obviously intentional as the George's character is the centerpiece and everything that is happening kind of bounces off her character.At the film's start, George's character Jess is taking her autistic son to his special school so she can go on a yachting trip with a her boyfriend Greg (Michael Dorman) and his friends, a couple Sally and Downey (Rachel Carpani and Henry Nixon), his first mate Victor (Liam Hemsworth) and Sally's friend Heather (Emma Lung). During the trip (in the Bermuda Triangle!), a storm hits the boat, turns it over, and the group (sans Heather, who apparently died during the overturn as no one can find her) is stuck on top of the overturned yacht until a large ship, The Aeolus, appears, which the gladly board. But strangely it seems to be abandoned, yet they slowly realize that someone else is on board, who is out to kill them all.TRIANGLE is combination of several different genres (mystery, horror, sci-fi, speculation) and I recognized the plot from previous films that I won't spoil, but even that I don't think would give away too much as when you see the film, you'll be amazed at how it all comes together at the end!",Triangle
60,aesgaard41,Triangle Is Stuck In A Circle,5,23 November 2010,"I've seen basically every Bermuda Triangle movie there is. I've seen them with giant turtles, a psychotic Luke Perry, a deranged Judd Nelson, a screaming Dana Plato, a demonic Kim Novak, a Nazi death ship and a scantily clad Catherine Bell, but this one takes and ignores all the previous Triangle lore for a story that defies explanation and basically never gets around to explaining itself. Melissa George stars as a harried mother named Jess who gets away for a boating weekend with friends off Florida. Liam Hemsworth, Chris's little brother, plays the big dumb guy while a cast of unknowns round out the rest of the characters. Now, the movie never mentions Bermuda Triangle (that I noticed), but it's very likely a Bermuda Triangle movie, and quite possibly the best one I've ever seen because it doesn't waste time trying to perpetuate any sort of phenomenon but rather focus on Melissa George as the central character. Jess and her friends get lost at sea after a strange storm with her friends and encounter a deserted ship, pretty much the same thing you knew was going to happen because it's already happened in ""Death Ship,"" ""Ghost Ship"" and ""Lost Voyage,"" but don't go off your nut yet, because it actually gets better. Yes, there are strange sounds and things happening on the boat, but this movie is just so much more than just another haunted ship movie. Everyone gets killed except Jess, but this is still not another serial killer movie. It turns out it's Jess, and the movie is one huge metaphysical time warp with her trapped reliving the exact same half hour over and over sometimes the victim, sometimes the witness and sometimes the killer. This idea is freaking genius. It's a complex and superbly written mystery that unwraps at a terrifying pace. Can you imagine if ""Friday The 13th"" was remade with the last girl pulling off the mask of the killer and discovering her own face? This movie is a strong plot-twisting character-driven film into the mind of a woman going mad, fighting to regain her sanity, losing it, regaining it, trying to escape and giving in to her insanity. There is not a cheap scare or a wasted scene in the whole movie. Melissa is incredible in this movie, virtually going non-stop as she practically carries the whole movie by herself, the other characters little more than chess pieces in her mental descent. The ship too is its own character with awesome sets, gloomy halls and a seemingly endless labyrinth of corridors that like the Overlook Hotel in ""The Shining,"" we never really see all of, and yet, wish we could explore. It never really explains itself, but then watching it you don't want to waste the time to leave the plot to explain it. For me, as a writer myself, explanations are not always mandatory for a good story, but this movie just sorts of demand it and when you reach the end, whether you figure it out or not, it's no longer important. It's just the story getting there that is more important. This movie definitely made me a fan of Melissa George and definitely proves that Hollywood can make a decent horror movie without cheap scares, excessive CGI or insulting sex and gore even at the expense of the headache trying to solve it.",Triangle
61,ajs-10,A clever plot surrounds this very tense horror...,8,4 July 2010,"I heard a few good things about this one when it was released, but didn't get the chance to see it at the cinema. Fortunately I have managed to track it down on DVD for a viewing. There have been many films where the same day or the same event is repeated over and over again, most notably Groundhog Day (1993). This is one of those films, but with a large amount of mystery, tension and yes, even a bit of horror thrown into the mix.A group of friends have arranged to go sailing, Greg, the skipper of the yacht, his friend Jack, a couple Downey and Sally have brought along Heather, who they are trying to fix up with Greg, and finally Jess. Jess has an autistic son, Tommy, who, she says, is at school, even though it's a Saturday. She seems distracted and sleeps for a good two hours at the start of the cruise. Things seem to be going well, there's a good breeze and the sails are full when suddenly the wind drops and they are left becalmed. They spot a violent storm coming in and when it hits the yacht is turned over. Clinging to the bottom of the hull, it looks bleak until an old fashioned cruise ship appears. The climb aboard but can find nobody about. Jess has the feeling she has been on this ship before and when someone starts killing them you know it's going to get scary! And that's where I'll leave it, but needless to say, this is where things really start to get interesting.It's a pretty well made film with a really great plot and some decent special effects, especially in the storm sequence. Decent performances from all of the main cast, Melissa George as Jess, Michael Dorman as Greg, Jack Taylor as Jack, Henry Nixon as Downey, Rachael Carpani as Sally and Emma Lung as Heather.I know the description above sounds a bit like every ship-board horror you've seen before, but believe me it goes on to be something completely different. Even to the point of explaining just why Jess is so distracted when she boards the yacht. I know some people won't get it, but believe me, it's really worth watching. Very much Recommended!My score: 8.4/10",Triangle
62,redrobin62-321-207311,Worth watching.,8,18 March 2016,"Wow, what a mindf*ck of a film this was! I had no idea going into this movie what it consisted of except that it's a horror flick, that's it. That it turned out to be a curvy/twisty Memento meets Saw movie was a plus. Totally took me off guard.I think if I had to sit down and write this film I'd have a stroke. Plotting a film of this complexity could render the average script writer catatonic. It was fun to follow the twists, though. The film lost a few points because of the vacuous yuppie characters who you could care less if they got killed or not, and the fact that the protagonist deigned to avoid herself and her crew instead of simply trying to eliminate them. Where'd that come from? Reach for a rifle instead of an explanation? Pretty brutal, but I guess, no blood, no movie.",Triangle

64,dfa120374,A Very Enjoyable Psychological Suspense Thriller,6,9 August 2015,"Triangle is a very good suspenseful thriller that not only keeps you watching but keeps the gears grinding too as it isn't the most straightforward of movies to watch. If you've seen Donnie Darko then you will know what you're in for with Triangle as both films deal with similar ideas.Films like Triangle are a very good break from the norm, the norm being films that lay it out for you, step by step, on what's happening and where they are going. In saying that, though, sometimes you get movies that just try to be too smart for their own good and are left so ambiguous that you don't know what the Hell happened. A mix between the two is ideal and Triangle is just like that. It doesn't try to be TOO clever but it also doesn't tell you what's fully going on either, and some of the story is up to you on how the whole event starts (when you watch the movie all the way through you'll know what I mean).Also, with the type of story that is being told here, it could so easily have been a bit of a mess after being put together, so the makers have done a very good job with the editing and storytelling to make it look so seamless. The way everything is all tied together has been cleverly done and is pretty impressive to say the least.With all that said, to say you will get lost very, very easily if you don't pay attention would be a massive understatement.All of this is convincingly acted out by the cast, especially with Melissa George as Jess, and may I just say that if she were to take on anymore roles that involve her wearing little jean shorts I will not complain. Not bad for a woman one year shy of 40. I've said it before and I'll say it again...she's definitely come a LONG way since her Home & Away days. Liam Hemsworth does a decent job also and at least he's much better here than he is in The Hunger Games.If you want to watch a very decent suspenseful thriller with a good psychological element to it, then you won't go wrong with Triangle.",Triangle
65,bregund,A smartly-written film that makes you think,9,8 January 2014,"This movie is exactly what's missing from the Hollywood moneymaking movie machine: an entertaining, well-written existential thriller that challenges your perceptions about the very meaning of life. I saw this film last night just before I went to bed and I couldn't stop thinking about it, and I even dreamed about it. If you've ever been even remotely interested in physics and how human beings perceive the concept of time, this movie will mess you up. At the very heart of the film's premise is the philosophical paradox of identity: am I the person I was an hour ago, or am I the person I am right now? Which one is the ""real"" you? This movie brings you face-to-face with the stark, cold answer. In my opinion, the two best scenes in the film are when the story wraps around to the killer's point of view, and when a wounded (Sally?) flees to one of the upper decks and sees multiple versions of herself, that part blew my mind.For anyone else who is tired of all the dopey explosion-ridden sequel comic book garbage that the film industry is spewing out these days, this film is for you, a film that doesn't insult your intelligence and one that might even change your life a little.",Triangle

One of the strongest elements of this movie is the editing, which, aside from a couple of misteps toward the end, is exceptional. This would have been a very challenging movie to assemble, which you'll undoubtedly note if you decide to watch it.Additionally, Triangle is more thematically serious than your average genre movie. This seriousness of character development and story does not bog the film down, but instead lends additional intensity to the suspense, especially toward the end.Especially recommended for fans of supernatural stories, paradox plots, the Bermuda Triangle sub-genre, or anyone who just wants to enjoy a thrilling, well-made movie.",Triangle

A woman is trapped in a looping string of experiences while trying to figure out how to change fate in order to save her son. There are some very shocking and original moments in this movie, the most striking being when a woman dies on top of a pile of corpses that are exact duplicates of herself. We want this poor woman to escape this limbo she is in but the haunting music and eerie atmosphere suggests otherwise. Triangle is a puzzle that unravels for the viewer piece by piece and that is ultimately never explained. It's a well made horror / suspense / mystery film in the vein of The Twilight Zone. The writing is most impressive, because even though the plot is complicated everything eventually fits into place. There aren't any big scares or graphic gore here, just a very good story that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",Triangle

69,LloydBayer,"At first glance, Triangle seems like a done-before psychological thriller, but by the time I got to the third act, I knew I was in for a mind-bending horror story.",8,19 March 2014,"If you were to summarize John Milton's description of hell in Paradise Lost, it would be the same as saying hell is a place where you endure unimaginable despair over and over and over again. On a lighter comparison, it's like being locked in a room and being forced to listen to a broken record – uninterrupted - for a whole week; if that sounds agonising, imagine how horrifying it would be to listen to that broken record for eternity. Written and directed by British filmmaker Christopher Smith, Triangle is a surreal depiction of that hell and can be perceived in several ways but ends up as a satisfying genre bender with a fantastic conclusion. Although I have had this film on disc format for a few years now, I never really thought much of it because the film opens with the pulp fiction of a B-movie production. That being said and having recently watched the entire film, I must admit that the experience has left me shaken. Co-funded by the UK Film Council in collaboration with Screen Australia, this film is in fact a low budget production that turned out to be a commercial flop. But wait. There is a reason why it is still a critical success and this is largely due to the cleverly written story arc. At first glance, Triangle seems like a done-before psychological thriller. Thirty minutes into the film, I found myself stuck between a sci-fi time paradox and a gruesome murder mystery, but by the time I got to the third act, I knew I was in for a mind-bending horror story.Smith's nuance is in shrouding the viewer with a darkening mystery. This is when we meet Jess (Melissa George), a single mother struggling with an autistic son. She is clearly troubled, so decides to take the day off by joining a group of friends on a boat trip. Her friend and skipper Greg (Michael Dorman) is the first to notice that Jess is reeling from a personal crisis; this and the fact that Jess has not brought her son along for the trip. Not long after the party of six sail into the open sea, they encounter a freak storm that leaves the boat capsized and one person missing. Now this is where you need to start paying attention (if you haven't already) because things are about to get absolutely bizarre. Jess and the remaining survivors are rescued by a 1930s ocean liner that appears out of a fog. Once on board they find the ship abandoned but in pristine condition. And even as they discover that something is not right about the ship, they are picked off one by one by a mysterious killer lurking in the shadows. Even if you have been paying attention so far, there will be questions running through your mind. Bermuda Triangle? Ghost ship? Without giving away spoilers, all I will say is the premise is far more diabolical than you would expect. Just as the mystery starts to unravel, Smith throws in a kicker of a twist ending that is not only well timed but also highly thought provoking. For a horror film, Triangle doesn't attempt to reinvent the horror genre and neither does it exploit it. This is not a Hollywood slasher and you won't find grotesque creatures tearing people's limbs apart. As an intelligent little horror-thriller that demands attention to detail, Smith's story and George's lead performance single-handedly holding the story together, the film more than makes up for deficiencies in the production budget. And for what it's worth, Triangle still manages to stand shoulder to shoulder with older classics, notably, M. Night Shyamalan's Sixth Sense and even Christopher Nolan's Memento.",Triangle
70,samkan,Good Genre Flick,7,16 March 2010,"If you understand that you're about to watch a modest budget generic horror suspense movie then you'll be pleased with TRIANGLE. It proves that a good script, honest acting and work with the camera can entertain almost every time. I'm not going to go check TRIANGLE's cost but lets just say they found a cool setting and applied a few nice special effects. A few of the actors are either first timers or non-professionals but you wouldn't guess such. There's one horrific, mind-boggling scene (not so much a scene as a set-piece) that was truly spooky. Just don't find yourself trying to make perfect sense out of the flick - just have fun.",Triangle

But I wont say more.I'll jump straight into what's so great about Triangle. It has this tense, mysterious, kind of sad, longing atmosphere, which really hit home with me. It is a mystery-movie, but with a lot of horror thrown in. For a while it keeps you guessing, and you always really want to see what comes next.A couple of scenes really stuck with me for weeks. I thought about this movie every day for many days. I see a lot of movies, so that's not something that happens a lot for me. I don't know why, and it is not something I expect others to necessarily experience. Well, I don't really think there is much more for me to say. Triangle is a chilling, 'atmospheric'(?), at times brutal, horror mystery. The acting is good, the plot is kind of smart, and it is a little bit of a thinker. There is still a couple of things I'm not sure are plot holes or just me being stupid. Nonetheless, I highly recommend it!",Triangle
72,daisukereds,How did I not see this movie sooner?,8,13 February 2021,"** Watch without knowing anything in advance if you can.The movie is a bit unappealing at the beginning.
Colors used, location and situation. It sets a certain tone, perhaps on the main character's outlook on life. But don't let it fool you and stick to it. It becomes a WHOLE lot ""prettier"" on the second major location (there's a point where it visibly changes). It feels like the movie starts on a low, but gets better and better as it goes on. After that, I quite enjoyed the cinematography, lighting and direction while still remaining unsettling (very ""gold"" and rich in what I think are more-saturated-colors). Even the sound design is great!As for the script, the lead (Melissa George) is the kind of unlikely lead I like to see in these kind of movies. There are some very good lines and trains of thought. Without spoiling it, the premise and how it moves forward is pretty clever, tense and quite entertaining. More importantly allows for very creative developments. It's hard to be surprised with movies, and this one managed to give me a smile a few times. It is one of the best written movies I've seen in a while.And aside from some slowed-down scenes, it's perfect in what they wanted to make. I would definitely recommend this!

73,krachtm,"A good movie, but not my favorite by Smith",7,13 December 2011,"The plot: When the distraught crew of a yacht come across an abandoned ship, they think they're saved, but we know better. In the tradition of classic Argento giallo movies, a masked person brutally hunts down the survivors, one by one. But if the ship is abandoned, then who's the masked killer? I really enjoy Christopher Smith's movies, and he's quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. His first movie, Creep, was enough to put him on my radar, but not really memorable like his following films. I thought it was above average, yet pretty standard for a horror movie. It was Severance that really made me a fan. I loved everything about it -- the humor, the gore, the satire, and even the acting, which has gotten some criticism. I saw Triangle without putting together that it was by the same guy who did Creep and Severance. Maybe if I'd remembered his name and gotten a bit more hyped up about it, I'd have enjoyed this movie a bit more. It plays into everything that I enjoy: an intellectual (even slightly artistic) take on the slasher/gore/giallo genre, a tight plot that rewards paying attention, a premise that could be either supernatural or science fiction, and it's got many references to other films. Widely considered to be one of Smith's best movies, I keep thinking back to it, and asking myself, ""Why didn't I like this as much as some other people? It seems like *exactly* the kind of movie I'd rave about."" I think it's because of the similarities to Timecrimes. Although the FAQ for the movie takes a defensive stance, arguing that the idea for Triangle is actually older than the release date of Timecrimes, the fact of the matter is that Timecrimes came first and did it better. That's not to say that Triangle is a bad movie or that it's even a disappointing movie! If I hadn't seen Timecrimes first, I think I'd give this movie a 8... possibly even a 9, considering how much I loved Severance and Black Death. In time, I may even revise my rating. Hell, I'm already starting to waver, thinking that maybe it *does* deserve an 8.I liked this movie quite a bit, and I'm not saying that it's a clone of Timecrimes. They are actually pretty different movies, even though they share a lot of similarities. For one thing, while Timecrimes does have a masked antagonist who wields a knife, it's not really a gore movie. Triangle, on the other hand, gleefully adopts and references many aspects of the late-70s/early 80s slashers and horror movies, like Friday the 13th and The Shining. Timecrimes is more of a thriller or suspense movie. Also, though both movies feature time travel plots and revisit the same scenes multiple times through different points of view, in Timecrimes, the time travel is more overt and grounded in traditional science fiction, whereas Triangle is a bit more supernatural in origin.I think that if there hadn't been a glut of time travel movies in the 2000s, I would have found this movie to be a bit more enjoyable. As it happens, The Butterfly Effect, Primer, Timecrimes, and Triangle all appeared around the same time, and, for my money, Timecrimes was the best of the them. Certainly, they all have their strengths and belong to different genres, appealing to different audiences. Like I've said a few times now, I really did enjoy this movie a lot, and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys classic giallo or slasher movies. However, if you're interested in repeating time loops, I'd suggest you look at Timecrimes, for an example of a movie that's done better.",Triangle
74,Danny_G13,Engaging but ultimately confusing mind messing movie,6,12 March 2010,"Well filmed and directed thriller entertains effectively but is arguably too convoluted for its own good.Melissa George, still best known as Angel from Home and Away, plays Jess, an apparent single mother struggling to raise her autistic child. Given a chance to escape for a period on a boat trip, she joins her friends for a day's sailing while her boy is in school, but before long, things go from bad to worse and she finds herself in a battle for survival.First off, I should immediately point out this is anything but a slasher flick - yes, there is blood, but it's ultimately a psychological thriller more than anything else - the gore is not the focal point of the story.Secondly, the title was thoroughly misleading - I thought this was a disaster movie involving the Bermuda Triangle, which it absolutely is not albeit there were supposed to be originally links. In the end the title, and trailer, for that matter, should have reflected the kind of story it is, rather than lure folks like me in expecting something different.That said, inasmuch as it isn't a blockbuster action flick, it is still a worthwhile movie - it would be fair to call it a psychological thriller mystery.And therein lies either its success or failings.On one hand there's a puzzle in here, a puzzle of connotations and scenarios - something which many viewers will adore and try to pick at and analyse.On the other hand there's the Vanilla Sky audience, who want things explained to them in a conclusive manner - and this doesn't do that.What you get out of this one is up to you, and what you expect from movies - it will be satisfying if you focus deeper and bite through the layers upon layers, which it must be said are extremely cleverly woven together. But if you want it spoonfed to you and an ending which explains the lot, you're at the wrong movie.Abstract, different, and certainly worth trying out - but don't say you haven't been warned about thinking harder than Armageddon made you.Intriguing.",Triangle

What actually transpires feels more like Christopher Nolan doing horror on a budget. And while there was no shortage of half hearted, Shyamalan inspired twist movies in the mid 00s, Triangle keeps a tight grasp on logical consistency even as it takes great liberties with the fabric of reality, revealing a depth of detail that was truly unexpected. Also, while the particular twist at the core of this picture has come up several times in recent years, in 2009 it hadn't been explored much outside that one rodent flick, so it's kind of a trail blazer in bringing the concept to a darker playing field.",Triangle

81,dschmeding,Go and watch this movie!,9,11 December 2009,"Wow, I was pretty much blown away by this movie. I went into this expecting nothing... sure, Severeance was a real fun flick, Creep sucked big time but anyway the plot of Triangle is so different from the directors previous movies I didn't expect any pattern.From the mysterious kind of dramatic opening to when main actress Melissa George (who steals the show here) arrives at the harbor for a sailing trip Triangle catches you with its atmosphere. From start to finish this movie is strange and mysterious and unlike most movies doesn't let you down in the end with a lame conclusion.The basic premise of Triangle reminded me a lot of movies like ""The Prestige"" or ""Time Crimes"" etc. The sailing trip soon goes overboard when a sudden storm front sinks the boat and the crew of five persons is lucky to cross the path of a strange old sea cruiser which they board and find to be abandoned except for some strange messages, steps on the floors and eerie prepared buffet. After all the title Triangle gives away that the idea is based on the Bermuda Triangle myths. So what happens in the Triangle? After a while people die and we soon learn that the Five are trapped in some strange time loop where they are confronted with clones of themselves re-boarding the cruiser again and again. Melissa Georges Character soon gets on to the mystery when she meets her own previous incarnation in this twilight zone. But how does this loop end? The biggest part of Triangle is wandering through the endless eerie floors of the abandoned ship uncovering the mysteries and each time meeting one more clone to be killed or to survive. The mysterious editing soon shows to be pretty clever and the re-occurring scenes from different angles slowly shed light into the hazy atmosphere. The movie lives of the dreamy and strange atmosphere, Melissa Georges stunning performance and a clever use of low budget CGI (I admit some of the high sea scenes looked fake but I admire the director even more to achieve such effort with obviously tight budget restrictions). There are so many memorable scenes in this movie (like all those eerie scenes with the stacking cloned objects), I was really afraid that the final resolution would kill it for me but Triangle surprised me with a real dramatic turn at the end that seamlessly fits the opening. Maybe its obvious to some but I was still surprised by the complex yet gripping plot which moves on pretty smoothly. Triangle is an awesome mysterious thriller with a heavy dose of drama injected in the main character. Like in the fore-mentioned movies many of the ideas were there before but its still a unique underground effort that should satisfy horror and thriller fans ans especially people like me who can't get enough of movies like ""The prestige"" or ""Jacobs Ladder"" of which I found some strong influences here and there.Triangle must be one of my biggest surprises of 2009 along with the equally stunning, mysterious and dramatic ""Blood River"".

82,quaseprovisorio,the film has a good idea but it's not much more than that,7,17 March 2020,"You could have a lot of theories. that jess cheated death and now is in a loop she can't leave, because death is still expecting her. that she was a bad mother and everytime the loop was a way to redeem herself in order for things to be better. That this is the purgatory, or that this is a reflection on her head on why she couldn't save her son. also why did she went again to the ship? well, probably because she was unable to kill them. she was thrown away by the first jess that arrives on the boat.the thing is: the characters apart from jess are just pieces on the table. they don't resemble real people, they don't have real personalities. they're just there as pawns for jess drama. that's for me the first problem with this film: forgot all the secondry characters and put all the energy into the protagonist.next: the film stops being scary after we understand that jess is doing all of those things. the loops are cool but they aren't scary anymore. this film becomes everything about the loops and i think it gets a bit boring. we kinda already can predict what's going to happen next.I liked the film, think it was enjoyable, i understand why some people loved it.

83,the_wolf_imdb,The Hell repeats itself,9,12 October 2011,"This is really great movie which ""must be seen twice"". It is definitely not suitable for those who expect some plain SF ride ending with a big boom at the end - its too overcomplicated in the middle and there are too many questions at the end.I do not agree with those who think this is a ""clone"" of Timecrimes for many reasons. The Timecrimes are pure SF thriller with logical explanation. There is nothing like that in The Triangle. First, there is no mechanism that would describe the time travel. Second, it is not certain how the happenings are related in time. You may note there is nothing like ""cycle"" - the yacht reaches Aeolus at least three times before the mother gets home. This does not match the number of dead bodies nor birds. So we may say the things do happen in a cycles but it is not certain how many there are or how they are interleaved. I lack logic or causality here to describe The Triangle as a SF thriller. It is pure mysterious thriller or horror. It is not scary yet it is very chilly at the end. Very very chilly.The very best description is ""the Limbo"". I would be more bold and say it is ""the Hell"". There is not a single character who could be described as a ""positive"". Especially the lead character, young mother Jess, is aggressive and selfish yet cowardly. She is definitely not likable. She loves her son but she hates him at the very same time so I would refuse her primary motivation for return is ""love"" for her son. She even describes her in third person when she speaks to him which I find seriously strange. There are moments when you think she loves her son, but it is more of explosion of selfishness and self pity. She does not care about anyone else, she simply follows the instruction ""everyone must die"" which she gave to herself. However there are no other leads that would point to this theory (that it is necessary to kill everyone to stop the cycle from happening). In my mind this instruction might be related to her as well. The cycle will end only when she is able to kill herself, to remove her completely. But she is not ready to do that. She kills her own copies ""because they are not her"" but she just cannot break the cycle. In the end there is only beginning of another cycle of suffering. The world around her skips in the same track as the broken old gramophone on the ship, over and over and over. An this is, my friends, the very definition of the Hell itself.I see the world of The Triangle as a construct, a personal Hell made by her for herself. Its main substance is the selfishness. She decides to board the boat again even she knows she will need to kill everybody to reach her goal. That's extremely selfish.The music at the end is very chilling and I feel sadness as she decides to repeat her journey. Someone has mentioned the taxi driver as a suspicious character. I really think he is the Devil. He does not offer her the ride to hospital for free or something like that you would propose someone who survived the crash miraculously. He asks her if she would like to take a ride. The choice is up to her. So she decides to go to the port. He does not offer her ride for free: The counter still runs. This ride is not for free. After all those betrayals, anger, cruelty, murders and so on there is a lie to the driver. She does not intend to pay him for the ride but she will. She made a very bad choice which will return her back to her punishment. That's the price.The movie feels depressing an chilling as I see her descent into the darkness. But she has no hope - she does not care about anyone else still. It is really hard to say if she is dead or how she have died - the movie describes ""the middle of the cycle of her punishment"", not the start. It does not even helps to point to any exit, if there is any for her. Maybe the taxi driver could take her to another destination if she would not try to sacrifice others to save her son who is loved and hated by her at the very same time.",Triangle

88,Indyrod,Very impressive twisty time thriller,8,17 May 2010,"This is a very very impressive and dark movie directed by Christopher Smith (Severance and CREEP). It involves a group of friends going sailing on a yacht, and encountering a mysterious storm that causes their yacht to capsize. From then on I can't tell you a whole lot, in fear of revealing too much of the excellent plot. As they struggle to stay alive on their capsized boat, Jess (Melissa George) spots a huge ocean liner which seems to be their saviour, but turns out to be a neverending nightmare. As soon as they board the ship, they go under attack from a masked killer, but that is only the beginning of a movie that exploits parallel dimensions, reoccurring fates, and be prepared to watch it a couple of times, because above all, it is totally mind blowing. It has elements of ""The Shining"" which are pretty easy to pick out, but all in all, I think it is pretty original and highly creative. Yes, there is a puzzle, which in turn reminds me a little of ""Timecrimes"", but this is much much better. Very highly recommended.",Triangle

A yachting party encounters a freak storm and are rescued from their capsized vessel by a mysteriously deserted cruise ship that seems to appear out of the blue. What seems like another retread of the old ghost ship story quickly morphs into something more akin to the excellent Spanish thriller 'Los cronocrímenes'.

113,w-71474,The beginning is the end,9,5 April 2020,"The biggest confusion in the film is the appearance of Jess after the car accident, when she was not injured. The plot I understand is this. The day before, Jess was invited by Greg and planned to take her son to the boat the next day. Before leaving, she lost her temper with her son again (well understand that this is not the first time. Children with mental problems do torture people). Then the flower skirt on the boat drove her son to the boat, and she and her son died in a car accident on the road. After she died, she remembered that she felt guilty about her son's attitude, and had a deal with the god of death (this plot is normal, the introduction of theism is normal). As a result, she deceived the god of death and was punished and entered into a Sisyphus-style cycle of suffering. In fact, she can jump out. Just before boarding the boat, the taxi driver said to Jess: ""I keep the meter, will you come back?"" But Jess didn't come back. She still hoped to go back to the boat to experience everything and come back to change everything. It's just a pity that she lost her memory on the boat, so all the tragedies repeated.

I love it when a film exceeds your expectations like Triangle did.Mellissa George stars as the lead in a small cast of young people on a yachting break off the coast of Florida who encounter a mysterious ship with no passengers after their yacht is upturned.What follows is a complex and superbly written mystery that unfolds at a perfect pace. I spent most of the movie trying to work out what was going on, trying to piece together all the elements of the storyline. Christopher Smith has clearly spent a long time putting this film together with an intricately crafted deal of detail. I was gripped from the moment the yacht capsized.The lead performance is excellent, superbly holding the plot together; and the supporting cast are more than passable. If you're looking for something a little different and you're happy to pay close attention to detail for an hour and a half, then I can thoroughly recommend Triangle as an original, well written and directed mystery that will keep you guessing until the final scene.",Triangle
117,mdnobles19,It sucked. Avoid.,1,5 February 2010,"I hated this film!! I'm going to be pretty rough on this because I had such high hopes for this thriller that stars the lovely Melissa George who gave a pretty good performance as a somewhat unbalanced mother of an autistic child who needs some alone time and decides to go on a sailing trip with a couple of friends but soon finds that was a mistake and finds herself stranded on a huge abandon ship that is in some kind of weird time warp. I think she is wasted here, it also had nice production values and had you thinking and on the edge of your seat throughout. The thing is that it didn't make much sense at all and is one of those movies that makes you make up your own ending to what just happened but that didn't help either and it still didn't make much sense. I added this to my queue thinking I was going to get a creepy Bermuda triangle mystery/thriller movie but all I got is an never ending thriller version of Groundhog Day and not in a good way. There were some pretty violent, bloody scenes here and there but not worth mentioning and had a great atmosphere that didn't deserve to be in this mess of a film. Overall this was a HUGE disappointment to me on all levels because it had so much potential but never went anywhere and left me confused and hanging and it's a shame because there seems to be a lot of effort put into this just not in the story or script which was a mess to me.

As a sci-fi fan expecting a sci-fi flick I found it pretty absurd and pointless. I love time travel movies and there were too many inconsistencies in order for Triangle to work as one.Now I realise that the mistake I made was to watch it and try to make sense of it in terms of a time travel science fiction movie.Which this most definitely is not!! This is not a time travel or a sci fi flick.I wouldn't call it a horror movie either, but the sense of dread and forboding that builds up gradually until the final piece of the puzzle is put into place is gripping. Some of the visuals are stunning and the use of a simple thing like a scratched record help ratchet up the tension.If you manage to wrap your head around what is really going on you'll probably find it more disturbing than a gore filled slasher flick.It's now up there with my all time favourites and I can see this as a future cult classic.Avoid the spoilers and watch it now.",Triangle

Knowing the genre, I was watching for clues from the beginning - so the repeatability and people meeting themselves in the past aspect of the film was not surprising. But what was surprising was the number of twists in the ending - which explains a lot of things you were not even wondering about.I know this is convoluted, but if you watch the film, you will see what I mean.The characters are very likable - especially Jess (Melissa George) and Greg (Michael Dorman). And you are puling for them throughout the movie to escape the crazy reality they are in (which of course they do not understand). The movie gives you glimpses of the future without explaining much - but trust assured, stay with it and all will be explained in the end.I agree with other viewers that this is a mystery movie - with a horror underpinnings.

Unfortunately, the writer just couldn't pull it all together enough to make it really coherent. This is what has kept it from being a commercial success.That being said, it's worth a watch. Some really great scenes (quite brilliant in fact); quite easy to follow narrative for 90% of the film; a few dumb moments where you ask ""why?""; an annoying character that satisfyingly gets shot at just the right moment (always good).Credit to the writer for at least trying to pull together a complex idea. Unfortunately it suffers, as do many films of this nature, by not really making, not _enough_ sense, but enough _plausible_ sense. And so, the ending is just a bit of a let-down. A bit unsatisfying, and a bit weak. A few people have listed a whole explanation of it that mostly works, but they've filled in a few of the gaps themselves.The main issue is that the true meaning of the film is too obscure, which means that most people just won't care. That's how I felt after watching the ending. There are some obvious clues, but ultimately the finale is not as good as the rest of the film (and it's been done before). There's no new ground broken here, and that is it's real downfall.

She felt she was going to get rid of her autistic son for at least a while and forget about him and have fun sailing with her friends, but on the way to school she had an accident and ""both"" she and her son died ""because"" she was in a rush to take her son to school to go to her friends.Then her ghost leaves her body and she doesn't quite realize that she's dead. That's why at the end of the movie nobody seems to notice her exit the car wreck and walk past them and in reality there was no body bag in the boot of the car. ""Her ghost"" hails a taxi and goes to join the friends she ""was"" supposed to go out with ""prior to her death"", but deep down she feels guilty. She ""knows"" it is her fault that her son is now dead, but she doesn't quite realize that she's dead. The entire movie is about her feeling guilty about her son's death. The whole trip, the ghost ship and the time loop are unreal and part of her mental torment and guilt. During the course of the movie ""her ghost"" undergoes some change and she says ""My world, i.e. my son, is waiting for me to pick him from school"". Then she tries to kill her bad selfish self over and over again and the loop would likely continue for as long as she accepts the fact that she and her son are already dead, but the movie never shows that, which implies that she lives in denial and cannot cope with her son's death and get rid of the guilt and consciously chooses to repeat the same cycle over and over again. This movie is in fact a ghost story.If this makes sense to you, please click ""Yes, this review was useful to me"". Thank you.",Triangle
130,fdbjr,The Dress and the Big Reversal (SPOILERS),5,8 July 2014,"I read a number of user reviews of this interesting, but ultimately dismal movie, and no one mentioned the points I am going to make. So for those of you who are interested:(1) At the end, the corpse in the traffic accident, clearly the heroine, is in the same flowered print dress in which she began the movie - and clearly, she is a corpse. Consequently, it is a pretty fair inference that her loop begins right then - she actually left for her trip in that dress. Why the powers that be decided she should spend eternity in a tank top and tight shorts, I don't know - but seeing as it is Melissa George and I am a solidly heterosexual male, all I can say is . . . well done.In any case, in every scene in which she is costumed thus, it can be inferred that she is deceased. (2) The Big Reversal has nothing to do with anything on the ship. It's the revelation towards the end that she was not a good mother - she was actually a terrible, abusive parent. (Losing patience with her autistic son doesn't necessarily imply that, but comparing him to his 'asshole father' definitely is beyond the pale). It is that discovery that puts the plot into damnation or purgatory country, which is what I think it is.But though it is interesting . . . gee. What did the other four do to deserve this fate? And make no mistake, they are not mere props. The director opens the movie in which they are introduced as independent characters. Big mistake. And eternal punishment in the form of condemnation as a repetitive serial murderer? A bit too subtle for me.Finalliy, there is not one light moment in the whole movie. The whole experience is pretty dismal. If you want to see a supernatural thriller with a Groundhog Day theme done well, take a look at 'Haunter' - even though there are no brilliantly beautiful women in shorts.",Triangle
131,midge56,A storyline explanation. Not a triangle movie.,3,24 March 2010,"Serious Spoilers! This is a full storyline explanation to be read AFTER seeing the movie. I wasn't happy because I was expecting a Triangle movie. Misleading the audience caused strong negative reactions. A different venue and title should have been chosen for this time-warp thriller. A bad directing job. I endeavored to explain the movie without too much bias.This cyclical time loop has the main character literally seeing herself coming and going. Unlike Groundhog Day, there are multiple copies of each person and bodies keep piling up and overlapping. Jess has several copies of herself.Beginning: Melissa George (Jess), a frazzled, single mother of an autistic son, arrives disoriented at the dock, invited by a friend to join an outing on his sailboat with his snippy guests.A radio distress call at sea (from a copy of Jess).Sudden weather squall capsizes boat. One drowns.Abandoned passenger ship suddenly appearsSurvivors spot someone on board (Copy of Jess) Survivors climb onto the ship. No sign of life. Fleeting glimpses and sounds of movement (copies of Jess)Each Jess copy is in different stages of confusion or bizarre behavior. Group splits up and wander ships passages. Jess copies leave messages, interact, shoot at and kill survivors.Jess with survivor group is confused, accused and pursued.None believe there is more than one Jess.One copy wears bag on head, shooting survivors.Copy tells survivor Jess, ""all must die"" for her to escapeWhen entire group dies, time loop restarts with survivors on capsized sailboat reappearing and they re-board ship.All previous copies of dead group remain in place with each time loop.Jess copies see sailboat wreckage as escape route home and kill survivors to restart loop to bring back sailboat.One Jess tries to save them but they don't believe her. Copy Jess tries to kill good Jess.Bodies of same person pile up in the same location. Over 2 dozen bodies of same victim Indicates number of time loops as one girl falls into decaying piles of her own copies.Jess sees 30+ identical necklaces lost in pile under grate. Indicates time loop occurred that many times.Jess fights with Jess copy and knocks her overboard.Jess wakes up on the beach and time loop starts over again.Jess hitchhikes home. Looks in window. Sees another Jess copy in house talking to her son through the window. Jess is horrified at abusive Jess copy slapping and yelling at her son.Jess goes into house, kills abusive Jess copy, bags body into car trunk. Son is shrieking and screaming at blood. Jess puts son in the car seat and starts driving. Son screaming as Jess drives. Jess turns around talking and drives erratic.Jess hits sea gull. Son screams at blood. Jess stops, gets dead bird. Jess tosses dead bird off embankment onto the beach below.Jess sees about 50 dead birds there. Time loop has occurred that many times and has not ended.Jess gets into the car and drives. Son is screaming about blood on windshield. She turns to talk to him and crosses into the lane of big truck.Flips the car upside down.Body of dead Jess copy from trunk is lying on street next to dead body of her son.Survivor Jess who survived entire ordeal is uninjured standing behind crowd around wreck.Logo on high school marching band base drum is like the name of the Triangle ship.Taxi driver offers her a ride. She goes to harbor. Jess falls asleep during the ride. Daylight changes from late twilight to early morning sunlight when she wakes up. Taxi driver says he'll wait and leave the meter running this part escapes me since she doesn't return and hitchhikes back from beach. Taxi driver may be an evil spirit in charge of time loop. He seems detached from everything but nothing implied.Jess goes to sailboat and runs into group members. Jess is at the beginning of the movie again from that morning. Jess is tired, disoriented and weary, but starts over again from the beginning and leaves to go on a sail with them.The only way to bring back her son, is to go through the entire ordeal again and try to change the events so her son survives. Just from the number of dead birds on the beach, this effort to save her son has already been tried many times. But since there are so many copies of Jess, she does not share the memories with any other Jess copies.I hope this helps explain the movie. I personally did not care for the way the movie was done. I hated this movie the first time around. There was no reason for director to involve the Triangle other than to be deceptive to audience which become enraged because they were misled by the title and slapped in the face. It is NOT a triangle movie. It should have been a time loop movie without the triangle. A different title and different venue were needed. This movie was handled and directed badly. The two subjects did not mesh together well and the audience felt cheated and lied to. With a better director, it could have been a decent movie subject without the triangle and without the ships.",Triangle

135,JamesIan2021,A Masterclass in Fear,9,3 May 2015,"A masterpiece. Melissa George delivers a sensational performance in Triangle, the most thought provoking, intelligent and incredible psychological thriller ever. Director Christopher Smith builds dread and uncertainty from the moment the characters set sail. The story focuses on Jess, a single mother of one who goes on a sailing trip with her friends, only to have the trip take a turn for the worse as they are hit by an electric storm leaving them stranded. Eventually, as the storm passes, Jess and the group are saved by a passing Ocean-liner, but as they board the mysterious ship they find it's empty, and a shocking revelation sets in as Jess realises she is caught in a time-loop, and she is the only one to solve the never ending nightmare. Movies that focus on time shifting narratives can irritate, or sometimes impress audiences. Denzel Washington's 2006 thriller Deja Vu seriously messed with time, to the point where heads spun and minds were baffled at the complexity, whereas Triangle uses a looping effect, meaning characters are destined to repeat time over and over, although only Jess realises what's going on and sets out to stop it. The events that happen are bloody, shocking and twisted, at one moment Jess stumbles upon a whole deck filled with her friends body, there are at least 20 of them showing how the long the time loop has gone on for. This is a real head turner but it's a satisfying payoff and it's great when you see the outcome. Beautifully shot with a dark atmosphere, this movie will send you on an unforgettable, twisting adventure that will leave you breathless and shocked, and the outcome is unforgivable and relentless. One of my all time favourite movies, everything about it is exceptionally crafted and it will be years till something as amazing like this will come around.",Triangle

The explanation of how this evolves is well done, but I was expecting a big payoff at the end, and was instead let down. The reasons she got on the boat in the first place become an inescapable loop, involving her denial and dementia about killing her son in an auto accident.",Triangle
138,shannen-l-c,Incredibly complex and mind-bending experience that's hugely misunderstood,9,17 February 2018,"I knew nothing about this movie and went into it blind (which I would recommend everyone to do), and boy, oh boy, did this movie take me on a wild ride. Melissa George is an actress I've always been fond of within the horror genre, so having her play the lead, Jess, immediately meant I was invested from the beginning. Melissa's performance is incredible and although there are a group of secondary characters, she really holds her own in this movie. The supporting cast are adequate but their limited screen-time means I'm unable to formulate any strong opinions on them. What makes this movie so amazing is that it goes in a completely different direction than anyone could predict. What you expect to be a typical slasher movie turns out to be so much more and the events that unfolded beyond the first 20 minutes of the movie completely blew my mind. I was glued to my screen from beginning to end (which is something that very few movies are able to accomplish for me) and after the end credits rolled I found my mind ticking over, dozens of theories and explanations whizzing through my brain as I attempted to fit the pieces of the puzzle together to form one coherent and interconnected story. It saddens me to see this movie gets so many low ratings and bad reviews based on the fact that people misunderstood the plot or failed to recognise the significance of the symbolism. Admittedly, this isn't a movie that's very self-explanatory and it doesn't surprise me that a majority of people fail to understand the ending fully (and I'm speaking as one of those people), but in an odd way that's part of the charm of this movie. It's one that leaves the viewer with so many questions and makes you want to watch it again to see what you missed - which I did, multiple times! It's worth investing some time to research the meaning of it (Peng Yang on YouTube provides a very in-depth analysis) and definitely re-watch it. It's one of those rare movies whereby each time you watch it, it provides a different, interesting experience and you notice little details you didn't before. When you fully understand the story of Triangle, you're able to appreciate how complex and intelligent it is. Every thread of the story weaves together to create the bigger image, but as the viewer you just have to find a way to weave those threads together yourself. It's a story about love, regret, grief, death, life, parenting, friendship, fear and so much more. If you keep an open mind when watching this movie and immerse yourself in the mysteries of it, you'll have a truly fantastic experience. The only reason my rating just fell short of 10 stars is because the ending was unclear to me on my first watch and I believe a movie should be coherent, self-explanatory to an extent that I don't need to research it in order to fully understand it. Other than that this is one of the best movies I've watched in years and I would recommend it to anybody that's a fan of psychological horrors or thrillers.",Triangle

140,ups-36964,A mind bending movie,8,24 January 2020,"Triangle (2009) is a movie with so many twists and turns that it'll trick ur mind and you'll enjoy when it does. The best part is that it doesn't have a specific genre. You decide what it is, a horror, sci fi, fantasy, thriller or a psycho thriller?The story is about a single mother who doesn't take care of her autistic son and treats her badly. One day, she goes to a sea trip with a bunch of friends. Then, a storm strucks thier boat named, Triangle. They get drowned. When they wake up, they find a ship passing by. They thought it was there to rescue. Little did they realise, it was way better on the sunken boat. They get stuck in a time loop. Tbh the concept of time loop im this movie felt realistic as every time the events didn't occur the same way. This means even though you can change the way of events you can't get out. Ok, that's enough spoilers.The story is intriguing and you end up binge watching it, if you start. It'll definitely mess with your mind",Triangle

142,Muldwych,"An Entertaining, If Flawed Spin On A Well-Worn Concept",6,8 August 2010,"Six friends find maritime joy is not on the agenda of the fates when they go sailing one morning only to find themselves caught up in a freak storm. Barely surviving their way through the towering high seas and almost Biblical deluge, the capsized crew suddenly discovers an ocean liner in their path, providing a timely rescue. However, relief turns to bewilderment when the seemingly empty vessel proves more dangerous than any high seas-thunderstorm. And why does one of the group recognise the ship despite never having set foot on its decks? The answer seems to lie in an old Greek myth.'Triangle' is not an easy film to review spoiler-free in any comprehensive way. Its strength lies in its level of complexity and the way in which it plays with multiple perspectives of a single viewpoint. Just how this complexity operates, however, is the crux of the whole piece and the key element that shouldn't be divulged to anyone who hasn't seen it.This is not to say that it is anywhere near the brain-teaser it tries to be, although it bears the hallmark of decent mystery-horrors by leaving the ultimate questions of plot to the viewer while dropping hints along the way. Unfortunately, some of the script's attempts to tie together the various strands of plot that make it so multi-layered fail in key places where clarity is especially needed, raising questions more out of irritation than intrigue. While some viewers have seen this as an enjoyable challenge in the quest to unravel the 'ultimate truth' as it were, I can't help feeling that writer/director Christopher Smith simply realised his script wasn't quite as clever as he'd intended and threw in a few inadequately explored wild cards to keep the message boards alive with debate long after the popcorn had been consumed.Neither is it terribly original, borrowing its central premise from other entries in the sci-fi and horror genres, from 'The Twilight Zone' to 'The X Files' on television alone, not to mention one very well-known mainstream Hollywood comedy film of the 90s. The viewer who tends not to be well-versed in the back catalogue of either camp will be better-served, seeing 'Triangle' as something more innovative than it is.Yet for all this, I found myself compelled by the story enough to see it through to the end, genuinely curious as to how things would pan out. Pacing is fairly well built up and from the very outset, the brooding atmosphere makes it clear something is seriously askew. Much of this is conveyed by the acting talents of Melissa George: the actor has come a long way since her soap opera debut and really sells her alter-ego's troubled predicament through her performance. Alas, while much attention has been lavished on the plot, little has been spent developing the supporting cast, giving them a very B-movie presence. This is undeniably a tour de force for George, who, while being no Cate Blanchett or even Naomi Watts, clearly has the presence to carry the film through its 99 minutes of runtime.The low-budget nature of 'Triangle' is most evident in the cgi, which I found suitably-placed, but terribly cheap and unconvincing where it really need to sell the drama. I tend to be of the opinion that if you can't afford good digital imagery, there is nothing wrong with practical effects. Still, the complete disinterest in hiding the fact that 'Triangle' was shot in Queensland, Australia rather than the Stateside shores of the Atlantic suggests that Smith was not terribly concerned about convincing visuals so long as they carried the plot sufficiently.And they do, for the most part. 'Triangle' is an entertaining spin on an well-trodden concept, guaranteed to keep many viewers guessing throughout. A shame then that it lacks so much in execution across the board, from lazy writing to weak characterisation and cheap post-production. It is ultimately worth a watch for the interesting ideas it explores and manages to present them with enough suspense and mystery to see the audience through to the end.",Triangle

So if you hate movies that involve alternate outcomes, time skips, and time paradoxes, avoid it like the plague and save your hate articles for the next Uwe Boll movie.What I found most fascinating about this flick is that (if you watch for it) every paradox is eventually accounted for...except one, try to find that one!

The acting is almost top notch, the camera angles and cinematography is decent and the story, although not unique is very different from the usual fare. Not getting into spoiler territory, the movie starts by introducing Jess who has an autistic child and being a single parent, she has her hands full. She decides to take a day off from parenting and go on a trip with a friend on a boat named Triangle. Some other people join (people she doesn't know who are friends to Greg, the boat's owner. The trip goes horribly wrong when a storm comes out of nowhere and seemingly maroons them. Just when all seems lost, a mysterious ship called the Aeolian comes to their rescue.

Towards the end I was hoping for a good ending but then the time loop begins again and my gosh that was really terrific to watch.How she was doing one thing again and again to protect her son. So if you watch carefully from the beginning you can spot the similarities between the ship they board and Jess' house.That's what I called exciting.I was able to figure out that she killed her son and was punished in the time loop till she admitted she has killed him which means she was in hell as it is evidently proved from the Aeolus reference and whole no air or whatever other people call it.

Jess character ably played by Melissa George continues to develop in the film, till the very end. The film is a good blend of drama, horror, mystery and thrillerThe name of the ship which comes to the rescue of the shipwrecked is called Aeolus. (Aeolus, äccording to Wikipedia,is a character in Greek mythology, lived on the floating island of Aeolia and was visited by Odysseus and his crew in the Odyssey. He gave hospitality for a month and provided for a west wind to carry them home. He also provided a gift of a bag containing all winds but the west, which Odysseus's crew members unwittingly opened just before they were to reach Ithaca.

160,tj_director,A pleasant surprise,8,11 March 2010,"I knew little about the film except that it starred Melissa George, was from the director of 'Severance' and I needed one more title to take advantage of the 4 for £10 offer at blockbuster. Without giving anything away, this is a really well made film that constantly has you thinking. Whether the pay off works for you is going to be down to individual tastes, either way once the story gets started, you simply will HAVE to know how it ends.This isn't a typical slasher film which the DVD cover would lead you to believe, this is a surreal thriller with a very strong performance from Melissa George (and without objectifying her sexuality, a great pair of denim shorts!!).Some of the CGI and compositing in expositional scenes do seem lacklustre, I'm sure it was down to budgetary and time reasons, but they do stand out, when they shouldn't have.. on the other hand, there is also some outstanding SFX work, and some truly excellent Art Direction. Another technical note, I've never seen the Panavision Genesis used so well, full marks to the DOP and camera crew for using the camera to the best of its abilities, there wasn't a single moment where I could tell this was a digital film, and I'm usually able to tell pretty quickly.I'm annoyed with the British film industry in general, they waste funding and talent, but this film and Christopher Smith and the team behind this film have given me hope, it's just a shame this film isn't being promoted properly.If you like stories set out at sea, and you like surreal and physiological thriller type films, then check this out, you won't be disappointed.",Triangle
161,raimund-berger,Intriguing.,8,20 February 2020,"I've seen the movie when it was released and liked it, even though I felt that I hadn't fully comprehended its logic. There were also a few minor points I was not so enthusiastic about, like the CGI and the overall color grading of the outdoor shots. Either way, I did remember it as being special.Now, about 10 years later, I've come across it again, and, with fresh yet more mature eyes, I do better understand what made it look special to me. Which isn't so much the ""looping"" construct of a story. But rather the main character, its two sides and how it's being forced through a process of (self-) revelation.The single mother with the handicapped child. Obvious signs of distress right from the start. The sense of isolation, the absence of family and friends. Where she appears to be alone even when in company of others. Then the entire ""deja vu"" and ""I seem to have been here before"" process, during which she begins to realize both, what's happening to her and who she is. Until the very end, when she - and we - finally come to see that other side of her, by the way she treats her child. And then, it seems, another round of split personality and amnesia.That's, to me, the actual, human core of the story, and for some reason it really becomes alive. It's presumably the acting. The mixture of distress, aggression, forlornness and even sinisterness Melissa George believably projects. What maybe also helps is her apparent contentment with the more physical acting, like when she fluidly speeds through a rather confined set.Unique film. Not necessarily a masterpiece in a particular manner you could immediately point at. But none other ever gave me a comparable feeling.Edit: I mean, one thing that doesn't sit well with the team is that all the sailing shots are bogus. Machinations, visibly so. That's particularly distressing since I've heard somebody say that Dead Calm supposedly was an inspiration. Obviously, minus the digital photography rebate, even, this film does not compare. Which is saddening, given that the acting was so great.Edit #2: The audio reverbs are another problem, apart from hardly any camera shot looking genuine. Maybe they shouldn't have made it sound like, over the canned engine hum, as if they were having talks in the midst of the Sistine Chapel.Edit #3: Fact is, after a couple of viewings you have to acknowledge that Melissa George not only saves but pretty much creates this otherwise very much defective movie. Just look at her 3 second reaction to when she killed Vic. She does that all the time. Squeeze the very most of her into practically nothing.Edit #4: It's when you begin paying attention that you realize that, compared to the acting, all the fancy gimmicks turn out to be almost pitiful. Just see Jess looking for stabbed Sally. Sally is here, camera looking at her. ""Sally?"" Pan, then suddenly Sally is somewhere else. I mean, this sort of cheap stuff contributes literally nothing to the overall effectiveness of the movie.Edit #5: I mean, the director's mirror shot he said in the commentary track he was so proud of - I never happened to notice. Why? Because the acting was so overwhelming. For comparison, I did notice the mirror shot in Contact the first time I've seen it some 20 years ago. That much I can tell you.Edit #6: Man, if they had taken the trouble, shown us some real sea and shot this on film. And would have spared us a few of the gimmicks. How much of a glorious movie this could have been.Edit #7: A real tragedy. Obviously, everyone was fully committed, sans reservations. Mrs. George in the first place.Edit #8: It has to be said at some point, the cinematography here is as much of a complete disaster as you could possibly ask for. Any random shot of any Star Trek original series episode looks infinitely better than any random shot of this. Guess that's your typical case where a film maker could try to secure a few extra $ to provide for the extra mile, at the expense of him/her having a career to look forward to or not.Edit #9: To conclude, minus Mrs. George this would very probably have been a rather sterile, somewhat cheap and really not so much engaging technical exercise. And i keep wondering if we could have made better use of what she was willing to bring to the project.Edit #10: Seriously, I can't get over this. When she steps out of the door in her dress, into the sun, to soon ask her neighbor if he had seen anyone ringing the bell or her door. What a miserable, lifeless, uninspired, 100% digital, in the worst imaginable sense, cinematography. The yellow tint, presumably applied in post production, plus the overbright, to make her blonde hair light up amongst all those mushy, meaningless colors. All this is is a pain to look at. And it doesn't get any better.Edit #11: Then look at the ridiculous red hairdo they had to supply Rachael Carpani with, because they knew already that, visually, and except of Melissa George's fair skin and blue eyes, nothing much more was going to happen.Edit #12: Seriously, this could have been a great movie. Starting with Rosemary's Baby style ""la la la"" and Lynch style lawn sprinkler. The actors certainly were fully committed, seeing how they ended up carrying this effectively clumsy thing over the finish line.Edit #13: I mean, it really hurts, when you know the slightest thing about water, then see them supposedly sailing and immediately know that it's all bogus. What a major, majestic crap fest in the visual department.Edit #14: And again, the one, single reason why I would wonder is because the actors threw this thing a lifeline. I mean, the script, well yeah, thanks, but on the reading level I couldn't care less if it ever did happen or not. Meaning, minus the execution it has no purpose at all.Edit #15: I mean, like the Sisyphus story. The director didn't want to confirm that it was exactly that, because it's been already told like 2000 years ago.Edit #16: So it has to be here and there, this and that. blah and blooh, and in the end you're none the wiser, simply because our sweet writer/director isn't entirely sure of what he's talking about.Edit #17: Which is perfectly ok, as long as he's fully committed to the mission. Like, par example, David Lynch always is.Edit #18: Of course, seen from the other, the production side, why would it even matter if I asked or criticized. I'm a mere consumer, and did not contribute the slightest thing to the final product.Edit #19: To which I respond, that's entirely true. But at the same time, you can't say how good it was without also saying how good it might have been in your imagination.",Triangle

However, the story itself has major problems and the film as a whole leaves a great big gaping hole in the part of my/maybe your brain that deals with logic and reason. Obviously this film didn't set out to be a standard slasher flick (which I was expecting and usually enjoy), but for Gods sake if it wants to take the viewer down the psychological route then please apply some kind of formula that will leave the audience satisfied with the end result and all round cohesiveness of the film. For sure, it was well acted, but the characters were one dimensional, bar obviously and quite literally Melissa Georges'. The film was well executed, but the script was/is flawed. And most of all the cinematography suggests brilliance, but in the end everything turns out insipid and dull.Please watch this film by all means, but don't expect to know the meaning of the whole thing, for I sure as hell didn't.

164,nEoFILM,Warped,8,2 February 2011,"This was an interesting, small budget Sci Fi/Horror flick.

Once they board the ship they are fighting for their lives, with varied levels of success and the a time loop takes hold.This is a well told, acted and directed Twilight Zone episode that just about manages not to out stay it's welcome.

The movie is very intriguing with a tight story and an interesting concept, it is mature, dark, a weird sequence which was all put together very well and you can actually decode the movie on your own without any help. It is certainly a psychological dark movie that creates an atmosphere like some of the great movies of that genre.This is the first movie I've seen of director Christopher Smith and I hope to see more of him, the directing was good, the music was haunting and it added a lot to the atmosphere, acting was good.

166,Mr_Saxon,"""You Will Come Back....Won't You?""",7,24 November 2009,"How to talk about ""Triangle"" without giving anything away? It's a puzzle equal to that which the movie presents its audience, because this isn't your standard horror movie. It has more in common with plot-twisting movies such as ""Momento"" and ""The Machinist"" than the gory likes of ""Halloween"" or ""Ghost Ship"". Perhaps a good start is offer some praise to the director Christopher Smith whose work i've been a fan of since ""Creep"". I also greatly enjoyed his follow-up ""Severence"", but ""Triangle"" is easily his most mature effort so far; and the entire movie has an almost dream-like atmosphere to it. It certainly looks beautiful and the haunting music adds to this ambiance.Melissa George, who plays the central role here, is quietly impressive; she's never really been an actress who has stood out to me in her previous roles, and so it was a pleasant surprise to see her rising to the occasion of taking center stage. It's only a shame that her character is so haunted and inaccessible. This isn't George's fault; the role is written in a way which keeps her detached not only from the other characters but also from the moviegoers. She's constantly aloof and distracted which can be initially annoying; it's hard to care for a character which you can't warm to.I would certainly applaud the makers for attempting something different to the standard horror story (although, I do admit that it is very similar in theme to one other recent movie that you'll probably see mentioned a few times in the forum for ""Triangle"") and I certainly enjoyed the experience. I'd recommend staying away from learning too much about the plot beforehand (the trailer, in particular, gives far too much away) if at all possible.""Triangle"" is very much like a movie-length version of a ""Twilight Zone"" episode but its also a very flawed piece. There's an intelligence at work in the script; the way in which the pieces of the puzzle are presented to the audience is done in a skilled manner but it also suffers from thinking it's far cleverer than it actually is. There are plot holes to be found by those who dwell on the story, and the ending isn't quite as neat as the movie believes it to be.Still, this is an impressive effort and well worth checking out (especially if you're a fan of the two superior movies mentioned earlier - ""Momento"" and ""The Machinist""). In a world in which cinematic horror tends to involve torture and cheap shocks, it's nice to find a more psychological effort that looks for other ways to creep under your skin.",Triangle

I won't put any spoilers in here or give away the plot but it was very creepy in so many parts, like the setting at sea when the wind and storm rolls in. It was fantastic yet so eerie! It reminded me of the amazing special effects in Perfect Storm with George Clooney. Melissa George was a terrific choice for the part of Jess.

Well, so far so ""Death Ship"", but even by then the viewer will have noticed that this is no ordinary thriller: the director has ambition and talent to spare, and stokes up a palpable sense of menace that tugs at the nerve ends, even when you're expecting a standard slasher plot. But it doesn't work out that way: the film goes into utterly loopy, ""Twilight Zone"" territory but never becomes an exercise in style over substance.

173,mecheart,A familiar premise without logical beginning or end,2,11 August 2013,"'Triangle' is another film I discovered searching horror movie releases by year. I had happened upon it previously, read the near uniform rave reviews, then lost track of it until my recent search. It is not a horror film in any form, however thanks to some research before going in, I was well aware of its genre which is more 'tales of the weird' than science fiction. The quality of the film itself is divided between just passable acting on the part of most of the cast, a mostly solid performance by Melissa George, and sci-fi channel caliber computer animation effects. In fact, the computer animated objects overall look incredibly fake, which does not always spoil a film of this type but in this case does subtract from our suspension of disbelief. Fans of this flick insist the viewer must pay extremely close attention to events as they unfold and so I did - in an effort to ensure I would not miss a single plot twist or sleight or hand. However, by the time the premise was revealed, I was well aware of it's intention. A number of films have taken very similar routes in efforts to beguile, bait and finally confuse the viewer into believing their stories. The story in 'Triangle' is not as complicated as it bills itself to be. Unfortunately, the plot reveals early on that it can neither follow a logical progression nor encompass a beginning or ending that makes sense. The writers ask us to accept this in place of focusing on Melissa George's short shorts and penchant for bringing on the tears in a convincing torrent. She is definitely not hard on the eyes. Thus in my opinion the premise does not work because logically it makes no sense, can never rationally begin nor end. It is of the variety where a time loop plot interchanges the lives, deaths, arrivals, time travels and rebirths of its characters. This kind of setup has worked in other films, yet at its best confuses the viewer needlessly with the cliché question ""Which came first ... the chicken or the egg?"" It is not original and in the context of this movie, does not compel suspense. Five of the six characters are very flatly written coming in just short of stereotypical sketches of individuals who commonly populate lower effort science fiction. I felt no desire to relate them, root for them or see them suffer for their grand folly, cruelty or tragic flaws - they seemed to exist simply to fill roles somewhat necessary to advance the plot which largely amounts to getting killed more than once. Melissa George's 'Jess' is revealed to us in two halves. In act one she seems to be a dedicated, even tempered mother of a special needs child who for whatever implausible reason jaunts off early one weekend morning with a wealthy patron of her place of employment, on his yacht and out to sea. We wonder where her child is, and so does another character, but the explanation assumed by another is the first of many difficult to compute without a smile rationalizations the plot will forward. She seems shell shocked upon boarding the boat and during the early part of the voyage, but bounces back quickly enough until the impending tragedy strikes. Act two shows us another potential side of George's character, one that makes little sense even after weak justification for it is provided. See, there are several of her in motion on screen at once, and although some versions of herself are more ""in the know"" than others, believing them all the same character capable of certain actions becomes very difficult - without knowledge of her that will come much later. Act three finally introduces us to the ""real"" Jess, and she is not a very pleasant individual. One could argue that the necessary change in her character happens in reverse - if you found said character interesting enough to really identify with in the first place, which I did not. Overall George's performance was by far the best, within the constraints of the film's shoddy plot. She performed well. Other reviews in general for this one have me perplexed. Judging by the numerous praise filled reviews, I expected a much better experience than what I actually had viewing 'Triangle'. The only sensible conclusion is people who really enjoyed this film had never before seen a cinematic iteration of its premise. That, or it was all about the cutoff jean shorts. While I appreciate lower budget science fiction efforts, the 'Triangle' is a film I cannot recommend to genre fans or really anyone else in particular.If 'Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner' in any form appeals to you, this movie's take on that haunting narrative likely with not.",Triangle

176,parkerrodney,More like a circle of insanity,2,4 January 2019,"TriangleTriangle is what I would call your basic loop movie, where the protagonist gets caught in a loop and is tasked with the challenge of breaking the cycle of repetition by doing something different that would significantly break the loop and end the insanity. The writer is given that basic task and either, succeeds or fails, unless the expressed intent is to create an endless movie which doesn't resolve, which makes no sense. As the movie resulted in the latter, questions abound.Whether intentional or not, Triangle is a loop without any resolution to the main actors dilemma, the quest to beat death by making small changes in her actions. She fails every time. For the viewer, we are simply left to conclude that you cannot cheat death, or even worse, the final days of one's death will repeat forever as you struggle to change the outcome.In either case, what we see in Triangle is a perpetual loop of pure insanity, unnecessary violence caused by an unexplained supernatural force on a ghost ship. This rinse and repeat story line just never ends, as the ending just takes us back to the beginning of the loop.Finally, once the movie is broken down into the basic components we find that there is nothing slick, clever or smart about the movie, and in fact there will be times when you ask yourself why the protagonist didn't avail herself of other opportunities to break the cycle. Quickly viewers will figure out that had she done what was obvious, there would be no movie. The entire point was an endless loop of hopelessness. If that was the goal, then success.Triangle should have been named circle because all it did was circle back.",Triangle

Despite some plot holes and loose ends, it is entertaining and might thrill you till some point, then it starts to feel kinda boring. The little details saved the movie from being a very very bad motion picture. Details such as the name of the ship Aeolus, and the myth around its name (which explains all the movie), not using a puny love story as subplot, just to have a sex scene in the picture, or make the audience have something to hold on to the characters, among a couple others details. The final act is pretty good, quite surprising but yet didn't save this movie from being forgettable and a little bit annoying with all the loops and plot holes. There is nothing to say about the acting. Melissa George gave a good performance, but nothing extraordinary... Christopher Smith wrote and directed it.

181,iSkyWalKing,Triangle goes full circle.. then the circle goes figure-8.,10,22 February 2017,"I absolutely love this film for a variety of reasons. But first I'll start off with the few critiques I can try and rally up just so I'm being objective.. This idea is not necessarily original by any means (Groundhog Day Effect), it's been done before from a variety of angles and for the most part, I'm not tired of the concept as long as it's done well.. There's a film called Timecrimes that came out in 2007 that probably comes the closest.Triangle in my opinion is the stuff nightmares are made of. There is a wide spectrum as to what most people consider 'horror'. For myself, I find often that films labelled as 'thrillers' can easily fall into the horror category as well. I am a HUGE horror buff as I watch almost anything with a decent enough rating, but more-so a film buff in general so it doesn't really matter, but it is interesting how films are perceived & worth mentioning.This film is incredibly dark, grim and atmospheric and leaves a sense of anxiety and claustrophobia which is quite gripping. It has a mild 'dream like' filter to boot which really added a gloss of confusion and despair in this instance. As the story unfolds you find yourself feeling you've figured out the plot enough to know where it's headed before the halfway point of the movie, then having that only turn out to be about half correct. Although it is constantly revealing itself to you it still leaves you on the edge of your seat and keeps its mystery. All the while the setting becomes more and more grim as the possible reality of the situation begins to unfold.**SPOILER** -- This film could have ended the minute she Threw herself off the ship and would have been fine, but the sequence of rapid twists and events that followed really went above and beyond to give this a dark, empty, yet incredibly satisfying ending. It leaves nothing hanging as it is all revealed before your eyes, yet somehow still wonderfully left to interpretation all the while bending and twisting our feeble little minds. For me personally, there were many elements of this movie (just in the last 15 minutes alone) that really hit home with me. This sense of doing circles, the helplessness and confusion, and the coming to grips & embracing the darkness rather than getting caught up in the chaos is a reoccurring theme in my dreams with eerily similar settings at times. This film brought that to life to some degree and I appreciate it for that.This movie just goes to show, that even while rehashing an older idea with a smaller budget, one can make an amazing film if the effort and skill is there. I remember seeing this when it initially came out on DVD and I loved it. Got a hold of the blueray rip yesterday and I honestly did not remember how the film ended what-so-ever.

No doubt about it, this film had different peaks of twists hither and thither; it took me through probably one of MY MOST FAVORITE MIND- BENDINGS OF ALL TIME. If you are a person who likes PLAYING ALONG with the movie and trying to figure out the mystery behind the truth, then Christopher Smith's TRIANGLE is the perfect movie for you.**Our story begins with a sort of eerie feel to it. When a single-mom named Jess (Melissa George) is holding her crying autistic child, Tommy, who is traumatized by something hidden that has happened in their HOME. We do not see what it was, which leaves you wondering...From this we jump-cut (from the opening CREDITS) to the introductions between a groups of friends at a boating dock along the Atlantic Ocean. Jess is the last to arrive, where she is curiously uneasy and is in a gloomy sorta trance. Luckily, her love-interest, Greg, who is the captain of THE TRIANGLE (the yacht), comforts her and makes sure she wants to go on the trip with him and his friends **(whom she has never met, by the way).A lot of elements in the beginning leave you wondering throughout. It gives you a chance to go psychotic in your own head; making up scenarios that are out of the wack.. or that might just be plausible.(Cont.) Midway through their holiday, they encounter a HUGE storm cloud moving towards them. This causes the sail-boat to be ""pushed"" over by massive waves, causing everyone to go overboard. // After the loss of a group-member (Heather), everyone else seems to make it okay on the upside-down, floating boat where they see in the distance a vintage-looking CRUISEship approaching. They think that they're rescued until they board the ship, REALIZING THAT IT IS possibly ABANDONED and might possibly carry something EVIL.DÉJÀ VU every-which-way you turn, Jess feels that she has been on this boat before. She begins sinking back into her trance, where she is quite possibly holding the group back from actually finding another bystander.**THIS IS THE POINT of the film that I HAVE TO STOP explaining before I give away too much.**THIS MOVIE left me at the EDGE OF MY SEAT ALL THE WAY THROUGH. // The TWISTS that I have mentioned are never distasteful; never take you away from the story or its meaning behind it.I actually watched this film THREE TIMES in a matter of two days from how much of a mark it has left on my brain. I highly, HIGHLY recommend this WORK OF ART to any viewer who enjoys MINDFUCKS about the TIME factor.****Such films as Run Lola Run, Groundhogs Day, Shutter Island, etc. I found so much ORIGINALITY in the script that I am dying to find a copy of it for myself, just to study so that I can learn how well it was actually put together.**I CAN HONESTLY GO ON AND ON ABOUT THIS STORY; AS ASTONISHING AS IT IS, BUT I PREFER TO LEAVE THINGS UP TO THE MIND TO FIGURE OUT**.I give this project a 9 out of 10, and believe it should get WAY MORE RECOGNITION than it already has. PLEASE! I URGE ANY FAN OF MIND-BENDARY TO WATCH THIS MOVIE NOWWWW. God, I am too excited about this.-- Michael Mendez",Triangle

Yesterday only i saw this movie. i felt like, this is the best thriller i have ever seen. If your life starts where it ends how will you feel. The movie start with. the mother(Jess) hugged his son and telling Everything gonna be alright.Then she came to harbor for sailing into the sea with her friends(Sally, Downey, Victor, Greg). After gone far away into the sea, big Storm came and they lost their boat. In that Storm one of their lady friend gone. Same time they saw one big ship come along their way. After they board in to the ship Jess felt like she know this place. I could not tell more than that. If told the story will be reveal. Director give the best of him.

One or two scenes push shock and horror to the highest levels of any film, and may be worth the watch for those alone.",Triangle

187,starcraftbw88,Overrated,4,9 August 2013,"Not sure where to begin. One of my problems with the movie is that the actions and motivations of the protagonist were confounding at best, and felt entirely contrived. Is the the most logical thing to do when you realize you're in a loop to mirror the actions of your former self? By killing everyone, she knowingly propagates the loop, even though she is told by former incarnations that it ends it - she quickly sees that isn't the case as once the last of her friends dies, she witnesses a new group of ""copies"" appearing. What would have lead the original version of herself to believe that in the first place?She continues to do mind-boggling things like kill herself because that definitely will end the loop. Then, she's seen driving somewhere, with body in trunk - we can only assume to dump it. So why take your autistic son with you? Ah, so we can set things up for the next scene in this poorly thought out story of course. Also, why is it the Jess we follow never experiences being partially shot in the head by a shotgun?Why does she ask to go back to the harbor? We can only infer that she loses her memory every time before the harbor. Again, willingly restarting the chain of events. Why does the protagonist never actually try to simply get off the boat? Why does Sally never seem to even acknowledge the 50 copies of herself? Why does she willingly climb into the stack? What is the point of this movie? The only redeeming quality is perhaps seeing the loop sort of come together, however flawed.The movie tries so hard to be clever, but ultimately I felt the plot, albeit cool; was rather weak, contrived, fulls of holes, and grasping. The ending, predictable and just not satisfying.4/10",Triangle
188,FSfilmblog,Ingenious little psychological horror,8,12 November 2010,"Director Christopher Smith (Creep and Severance) has pieced together a superbly written story about a young single mother Jess (played by Melissa George) who was invited by her friend Greg (Michael Dorman) to his yacht for a leisurely Saturday cruise. Also on board are Greg's friends Victor, Downey and his wife Sally (who also brings along an unexpected guest Heather). When Jess arrives at the harbour, nothing seems quite right (you'll understand why later on), without giving too much away they set sail and suddenly the wind drops leaving them stranded A storm happens to be brewing ahead of them and before they could do anything, the yacht gets caught up and is turned over by a wave with one of the crew members being swept away. What happens next is the start of the never ending nightmare for them all.When the storm dies down quietly approaching them is an ocean liner, The Aeolus. A deserted ship with only a shadowy figure on deck they spot as they call out for help. They jump on board to try to find their missing friend and to alert the coast guard for help but as arrive onto the deck, Jess gets a sense of deja-vu.The basic premise is that the shadowy masked figure turns out to be hunting them down and Jess is the only one who has the answers as to why 'they' are doing it.When we get into the interiors of the ocean liner you can see the references to The Shining. Long corridors, writings on mirrors, even the room number 237 (where Jack Nicolson character discovers the evil spirit) makes an appearance in this film. The whole ship is a complete maze just like the hotel.What I really like about this film is that there are a lot of pieces to this puzzle which all becomes apparent as the film goes on. It's intriguing how it all works and how Jess is forever battling on to change her destiny. There are so many little clues within the dialogue that you would only notice upon a second viewing. It is definitely a film you need to watch twice to completely appreciate the effort and the logistics on how and why everything is played out the way it does.What you'd expect to be a stalk and slash horror film turns out to be a very ingenious little psychological trip. You might be surprised when the masked killer is revealed but then again you might not, this isn't the main objective of this film. The acting is above average, the plotting and script is excellent. I can't recommend this film more highly. I was pleasantly surprised by how the film turns out and very impressed on how it all fitted neatly together.When you finish this film, you'll also see why the seagull is so important to the film. It follows Jess all the way through the film caught on the same path as protagonist.Without the seagull we'd have no film.....Pay attention to the opening scene as well as it is also the beginning of the end (quite literally).Definitely one to pick up and watch over and over and over and over....if you like my review please visit my blog http://fsfilm.blogspot.com/",Triangle

It starts off really well, friends off out on a trip on a yacht run into problems, board another bigger ship and run into even bigger problems. The film progresses and keeps you gripped as to how its all going to work out and as to where its going to end, but then thats just it, it doesn't end and it doesn't answer so many questions, the plot holes are huge and when it finishes you just sit there expecting some more and you don't see it all work out after all...I don't know, lots on here have reviewed it as fantastic but i just would like an explanation as to why and where does it finish. Without spoiling the film for you thats the best i can write, see what you think, its certainly not the worse film ever.",Triangle

This movie had my mind spinning so much that I spent days afterward hungrily analyzing the parts that were more vague so that I could get a better picture of how each plot element worked in the story.Watching this movie is quite the experience! It twists and turns like a roller coaster and its revelations will surprise you to the very end (and some may even evoke a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach).There are also some scenes that are truly disturbing, even to someone like me who's become numb to movie gore. There's one particularly shocking scene that I will never forget and which I will not spoil it here but I will just say that it involves the character named Sally.As a hardcore horror fan who's seen over 200 different horror movies, Triangle deserves to be considered one of the greatest in the genre.",Triangle

192,msmchug,Loved this film!,9,24 February 2014,"When the film started i wasn't sure what to expect but it gets going really quickly. I thought it was going to be a haunted ship ghost story but it was way better than that. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone but it's very clever the film plays round in a loop but from all different angles. Melissa George plays a great part and a multitude of different roles and emotions. You could think that the ship is stuck in a time loop ""the Bermuda Triangle"" but given that the main character makes it home and away from the ship.. I think it's her that's stuck in a time loop. Like Groundhog Day. She needs to get back on the ship and live through the whole trauma of the film to make it back to her home and change her own fate all over again. The film doesn't really come to an end, and your left guessing about her fate. I really enjoyed this movie.. It's a bit like source code but more scary and thought provoking.",Triangle
193,codefool,Poor attempt at a time loop,2,7 August 2021,"At it's heart this is a poor remake of Los cronocrímenes (2007) and makes the same errors.Throughout Jess' Melissa George adventure, she could have at any time exited the time loop. At any time. And as we learn from the final scene, she enters the time loop with full knowledge of everything that happens in the time loop. It's frustrating to watch a character fight with their future self, seemingly ignorant of their own fight with a future self in the identical fight before. Never does she say ""Wait - last time I went this way and this happened, so I'll go another way and do something different."" At one point the future self hides in a place the past self hid in, but doesn't pursue, only turns away for some reason. At one point she mutters to herself that she needs to change the pattern, but she never really tries to do this. She could have also just stood up and said ""Hey - I'm a future self. Something really weird is going on here."" Instead, she dons a disguise and goes to murder everyone so the time loop can repeat. Supposedly.She even says how she can fix it ""by going down to the landing and prevent people from coming on board"" which she was free to do - but didn't. For some reason she chooses to hide and disguise herself.The choices the protagonist makes are unexplained and unreasonable, and only serve to propel the story forward. It makes no sense, and hence is aggravating to watch.Otherwise, the acting and cinematography are good, even if the CGI is a bit low-budget.",Triangle
194,sreethered,An underrated movie,10,18 December 2013,"I wonder, is there any other movie that made me this much fascinated??? No, because this is the first movie that I have seen in this style, even before 'Groundhog Day' and '12 monkeys', and the first one is always special. Speaking about Triangle, it is one of those movies that haunted me even after two weeks later. I watched it when there was some work had been going over the electricity line and I lost power in the middle of the movie. I spent the next one hour without power, thinking about what had became of those characters on the ship, and I wandered without patience. When finally I finished it, I couldn't explain the horror and joy I felt at the same time. Those were some precious moments. Now, about movie. Triangle holds the conventional horror elements which it couldn't wither away. That was a downside for the movie, and it never gave a conclusion about the title, that whether it was about Bermuda, or was just a representation of the triangular story structure. Whatever it is, Triangle still has it's arsenal fully prepared to amuse us. The director Christopher smith is a talented horror movie maker and had proved it with the movies creep and severance. But, unlike his other movies, Triangle never showcases the gruesome elements, and it focuses on the character jess, and her struggles to cope up with the realities. Some of us will find out it as a poorly prepared mash up, still as a mystery movie triangle holds some thoughts and it definitely needs our attention.",Triangle

Not that I have seen much Australian/UK movies, they just don't seem to interest me much in general. There is always something about them that makes me feel instantly bored. Not that I consider special effects to be essential for movie to be good but American movies seem to be best at it. With that said, this (UK/Australian) movie has pleasantly surprised me. Even the special effects were superb.I love movies that make you think and this is one of those movies. The story is excellent, a perfect mystery movie. I never got bored and the movie wasn't predictable and it made me want to see what would come next the whole time.Melissa George did an outstanding job as the lead. Her acting is crucial in helping you understand the story and she will not disappoint.It's not a slasher movie in which people are being killed purely for viewing pleasure.

199,grendel-37,Triangle: The Other Side of this Angle,4,19 August 2010,"I've gotten out of the habit of posting my reviews on IMDb, but I'm going to make an exception in this case, for the simple fact I wish someone had warned me off this movie. Based on the monumental praise for this film, I almost purchased it sight unseen.That would have been a mistake.Why? The film is well photographed, starts off interestingly, but unfortunately tries to stretch a 40 minute start trek/twilight zone/ground hog day premise, done very poorly, to fit two hours.It becomes almost from the first, agonizingly predictable. And doesn't try and do anything but show that predictability. It sets up early this idea of a paradox, and spends the rest of the movie not going beyond what quickly becomes a very boring infinity loop.Luckily I managed, rather than buy this film, to rent it for $2.50.And even at $2.50, I paid too much. And worse than the money is the 2 hours wasted on this film.If you think this film is a great mystery, or a masterpiece, or thrilling, or most laughable of all smart and original, then I would say to you, you are very young, and you have seen very little.The best description of this... exercise of a film.. is it's a 40 minute star trek time paradox episode,mated with a poorly done slasher film, stretched with agonizingly repetitive scenes to squander 2 hours, without really advancing the plot anymore than the first 40 minutes. ((if you just got deja vu, from that paragraph, that's basically all the movie does for its entire length) It may be genre-defying to someone alien to such concepts, but I found it tired. And the lead actresses performance, annoying to the extreme. And her actions brain-dead and moronic. Even before we get to the ship, I'm sick of her doe eyed halting infuriating manner. I mean throughout the entire movie I really get sick of her and her face. I mean real dislike first because of her inaction (inability to speak) then for her stupid actions.Try something different to break the loop, like maybe jumping off the ship, or shooting yourself (now that may have made me happy for a second. Her character grated on me that much). But no that would require an actual plot, and more than the 40 minutes of redundancy that make up this ""film"".But on the positive, it was well shot, the cinematographer the only bit of gold, among all this tin. And it could have been an interesting premise, that a real writer may have made something of, rather than this... waste. The movie effectively ends in the first half hour, and nothing that follows is either original or interesting.I wanted it badly to get interesting, to get intelligent, but it just doesn't. I can't even work up the interest to say anything more about this film.For far better movies try just about anything. For a MUCH MUCH MUCH better movie dealing with triangles I recommend the low budget gem THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. And for a far more intriguing thriller, that is actually smart and brilliantly directed and has some boat action, try the brilliant Ibanez Serrador film, WHO CAN KILL A CHILD.So Triangle gets a huge Not Worth Renting vote from me.

205,mdarmocida,Nonsensical Nonsense,1,7 April 2010,"The movie is neither original nor clever and leaves way too many loose ends. Unlike Ground Hog Day, where you were entertained with each new twist in the loop (where Bill Murray learned from each past experience), this movie just looped nearly the same crap over and over again until you wished it was you being killed. I stuck it through thinking that there had better be a very clever ending to make this movie worth my while (and money) and then they end it with a letdown worse than the Sopranos.At least tie up the loose ends and give the viewer some sense of closure. For instance, was the son always Autistic - or did he only become that way after he saw his mother murdered? Why did her personality change to the point that she was now a loving mother instead of an abusive bitch - what caused that to happen? If she's continually following the same loop then she would know that her son will continually die so why did she want to go to the harbor to live it all over again? At the end the viewer is given the impression that she mentally blocked out the past and didn't know what she was getting back into (except on a subconscious level) but that doesn't tie together because she obviously went to the harbor with a determined goal and even told the Taxi driver that she would return. All this could have been fixed if the writers bothered to take the time and develop the characters and story, which they chose not to do. Instead they created a nonsensical, open ended movie and thought ""gee people will think this is clever.""",Triangle

The detail that struck me the most was the striking echo between the cruise ship's discussion of Sisyphus and the words of the symbolic taxi driver at the end. With this level of detail, the film was able to upgrade from a type of suspense film that sells structures to play, to a masterpiece about religious philosophy and ultimate care. The philosophical discussion that can be elicited from this film is therefore endless. In addition, the title Triangle also seems to hint at the ultra-stable loop structure of time and space as an executioner. 3 In the context of this film, it has also been given a symbolic meaning of religion.",Triangle

209,mauvemoonlight,Not even worth the three stars I gave it,3,1 September 2011,"Major spoilers in this review - do not read if you have not seen the film.This mess of a film stars Melissa George, whose idea of acting is to go around with her lips slightly parted all the time,revealing her rabbit teeth, like she is a chronic mouth breather, or perhaps she simply cannot close her mouth because of too much collagen injection in the upper lip.As some other reviewers here have pointed out, this film has loopholes so big you could throw several basketballs through them quite easily.In fact, even the writer loses track eventually and has the ""Jess"", who has finally figured out what is happening get thrown overboard by the other ""Jess"", who knows only a very small part of what is going on.When the two Jess's battle each other, the one who already knows what is going to happen next should have therefore known every move that would be made by the Jess she is fighting and therefore she should not have been the one who went over the side of the ship.Then the writer apparently doesn't realize he had the Jess who knows what is going to happen next the one who went over the side, because he acts as if the 'Jess', who only knew part of what was going on is the Jess who knew everything, but we can clearly see the difference between these two Jess's because the one who knew what had been happening is wearing a hood in this 2nd scene of her going overboard.Jess also has at least two or three opportunities to kill one of the other Jess's - has the gun aimed right at another Jess - and yet while she can kill everybody else without a qualm - she never kills one of the Jess's until much, much later, not even on the ship.If she had only killed the first Jess she saw who was doing the shooting maybe that would've changed things.As it is, both the character, Jess, and the long-suffering audience are forced to re-live this endless loop in which they are all caught up.Furthermore, we are never given any really good explanation for any of it. Why is Heather on the boat but not on the ship? For that matter, why are any of the other people on the ship? We do eventually get the impression that perhaps Jess is there as punishment for her mistreatment of her young son, but the other people? There is no reason for them to be in the loop except for them to be killed over and over again.For that matter, Jess' idea that killing everyone is going to stop the loop is absurd.",Triangle
210,mailofthefuture,One of the Best Movies I've Ever Seen,10,9 August 2014,"Writing reviews are tricky. How does one convey their emotions into words accurately? I find that when I read other reviews that give particular movies high praise, I immediately get defensive, questioning the writer's motives, thinking they are exaggerating, or worse, assuming that they are only twelve years old.So I'll start my critique by stating that I am 34 years old and college educated (if that even matters). Triangle is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life. The story is genius, the attention to detail is impeccable, the multiple camera angles used presenting the same situation from different vantage points is clever, the acting is superb, the influence taken from mythology gives the movie depth and substance, and the music that was chosen is the glue that, altogether, delivers an absolute perfect movie, overly impressive considering the budget was only 12 million.I knew when I rented Triangle months ago I had just seen something extra special. But after seeing it a 2nd, 3rd, 4th & 5th time when it debuted on Showtime this week, I am willing to say that it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. How many movies can you honestly say you watch in your lifetime that when the movie ends and the credits come on the screen, you immediately start it over from the beginning??? I can't remember many...One tip, if watching it for the first time, I would advise you to try to pay attention to every detail possible. It's not necessary, but you will appreciate the genius of the movie more the 1st time you see it. And last but not least, and most importantly, this is not just another redundant horror movie. If you assume that it is, you might develop a bad attitude and lose focus in the first 30 minutes, where things don't really blow your mind until about 35-40 minutes into it.The funniest thing about IMDb is how you'll read reviews with people absolutely raving about movies, only to give them 7 or 8's.

211,marksrtrom,Film puzzle with an interesting storyline cyclical,10,7 September 2013,"If something not correct, sorry. It's was translated from 900913. One of the crucial and most important moments - some symbolic level to spirituality. This is when Greg , on the yacht , said the main character in a difficult moment , that she is a good mother and she can not be everywhere and always with her son , and in the event there is a conflict of reality and spirituality ... If you look you see. But even with all this, GENERAL beginning of the cycle - at the wrong moment. Alas were shortcomings and errors in the film - it saddens ... but maybe just say , as always in one. On Human Nature and its imperfection . The human factor . And this is saying is that we always have to strive and grow, at least for us rooted in the nature of opportunities. I hope that at least a large number of minorities , were able to understand TRIANGLE events taking place on the ship. In fact, this film is a puzzle , so do not be surprised . Presumably the start of a cycle , is the death of her son. BUT not the death that you showed the director. And the first fault Jess , mother, whom the director has not found show . You can still see that in the beginning of the film there is no current event that will be shown near the end of the movie. In the beginning , it is shown as a mother herself after killing the other - hugging her son and calms him down. This does not apply to the first event , I think it is clear why . This insertion within the meaning of the mother's love for her son that is the basis of the film, which is more clearly shown us in the last part of the film. In fact the beginning of the cycle we have not shown , as I wrote earlier , it appeared from the very first event , which gave an emotional reaction to the yacht. And then the event is allegedly 1st death of her son was her fault , but in this version you saw at the end of the film , it is already another version or even the possibility of other options. Since the plot is closely related to the concept of a triangle. But you can see how the first Jess , and she was such shows - anything from what is happening is not understood . She was beginning to understand step by step . But perhaps , as we showed the director, namely that Jess , after his death in a car accident, she allegedly forgot about everything . In addition to the most important - it's about her son , the meaning of her life, and she remembered about him always . At the time of his death, he was beside her. And at the moment when the taxi driver drove the calling her and she gets some ( there are already more than a fantasy writer or director ) , the other a chance and come to life , because it goes into a stage of life where she continues to further communicate with other people and are floating on a boat .

In fact, after she appeared with a shift in time and could not be home until the death of his son , or even the death of her first son. That in the end she wanted to avoid all my heart , BUT unfortunately . Those of its activity, as shown - led again by the same cycle of the death of her son. As if by the will of fate she could not fix it. Here is a triangle and starts it in the event, which brought her to the decision . Dead birds on the dock where she throws another bird, shows us that , in principle, all the events that take place as a start from scratch, from the moment when it comes to life after the accident, or the death of another , because the accident to "" throwing birds."" Then , as if everything is correct. But the director's work , too thin , well, in principle and subject matter is not easy. Director and screenwriter was difficult to determine the precise point . you need to show and what better not to show the beholder. Not to brighten the picture in advance and it was fun to watch .. So there is a lot of subtleties ... And about the "" kill all , kill them all,"" there is a fine line in the relationship . , Which eventually falling overboard , she dies herself , the last of its latest range of cycle.In a simple way in order to understand.",Triangle

213,lincolnhawk-87377,Hard to Wrap My Undersized Brain Around,7,20 July 2020,"I think I liked it, even though I'm not sure I fully understood it. I read a couple of the 10 star reviews and found a few explanations that made some sense; I think it can be interpreted in a few different ways. It was definitely thought-provoking for me, if not for everyone, based on the negative reviews. I would recommend watching it and deciding for yourself. I also recommend checking out the 1 star reviews for some entertaining bashing of this movie. My favourite focused solely on the fact that in one particular scene the left hand tap of a sink was running and steam was rising from the flowing water, despite the fact that, according to the enraged reviewer, all US hot taps are on the RIGHT. Due to the looping nature of the movie, this egregious error is shown TWICE!! Now THAT is a discerning critic. Another reviewer repeatedly refers to the lead actress, Melissa George as ""Trout Face"". If you don't enjoy the movie, maybe the reviews will entertain you.",Triangle
214,jhunt709,"Thought-provoking, but not for those who look for payoff in their movies...",7,29 October 2009,"I hadn't been highly anticipating the release of Triangle as I'd not been following its production; I only noticed adverts for it before its release which looked promising, so I decided to give it a go. The story has a steady build-up in which we are introduced to the characters, a group of young individuals whose boat is overturned during a sudden storm at sea which is accompanied by a chilling distress transmission. When the deluge passes, they board a large vessel that has seemingly appeared from nowhere, having noticed a figure up on board looking down at them, as if noting their arrival.Of course, making their way through the interior of the ship, leading lady Jess (portrayed fantastically by Melissa George) feels that the setting is familiar, and it isn't before long that she is accused of turning on the rest of the group as they are stalked by a menacing figure. As it emerges that they have become caught up in a repetitive loop of arriving on the ship and then being picked off one by one, Jess attempts to work out how to 'break the pattern'.No doubt about it, Triangle is clever; it doesn't just look smart, but it remains coherent throughout its running time. Attention to detail is paid and even though the initial viewing may leave you confused as you simply haven't got the time to take it all in, after it's over and you've read up about the plot on the internet then things start to fall into place and you come to realise the extent of its brilliance. A fair balance of gore and suspense, Triangle is consistently gripping, twisting its way through the events shown in the film, right round 'the loop' and back to the beginning, where the actions and behaviour of the characters become slightly more clear.Engaging from beginning to end, Triangle is a film that will split the opinion of viewers as the film begins to draw to a close. This is because, as you begin to picture how the film might end, you get the feeling that the explanation you're looking for doesn't exist. I wouldn't say that Triangle is overly ambiguous; enough ideas are presented in the film to allow you to form your own opinions on the 'why?' questions that the movie doesn't really answer. If you're happy to come away from a movie with more questions than answers, willing to accept different interpretations as possible theories, then I highly recommend Triangle. If, however, you want the payoff, the explanation, to know exactly what's happening and why, the film may leave you unsatisfied. Personally, I'm for a mix of both - I'd have loved to have known more about the boat, why they got caught in a loop etc. - so I didn't feel completely deprived at the end. It is simply a shame that despite the movie having some intriguing references to relevant mythology, these aren't followed up in the form of a clear solution. It isn't that the ending is bad or lazy; it's just that for those of you who watched the film to find out what was going on in the trailer, Triangle may not deliver. Still, I recommend all fans of psychological thrillers/horrors give this fantastic little film a chance in order to form their own opinions.7/10",Triangle
215,Lord_Frog,Very good and intriguing,8,27 August 2009,"I just came back from the world premiere at FrightFest in London, it was the festival opener as well so expectations were high and it didn't disappoint! Much better than Creep and Severance, this is Christopher Smith's most ambitious film. A mind-bending story that is as puzzling as it is original, Triangle is more a mystery than a horror movie in my opinion. Gorehounds will be sorely disappointed. This is more about a situation which becomes more and more surreal, almost dream-like, I thought during the film that I've had similar nightmares as a kid... nightmares going around in circles and getting more and more frightening because I knew when or how the monster would inevitably come back...The plot (no spoilers): after their yacht is overturned during a freak storm, a group of friends are desperate for help. A cruise ship suddenly appears and they see a figure looking down at them from the bridge for a few seconds. They climb on board but there is no crew, no passengers, nothing. Saying anything more would be ruining the movie, so I'll stop here.After the movie ended in a round of applause, Christopher Smith said that it took him 2 years to write the script, and in the end it's not surprising as this is a very complex plot and to make all the pieces fall into place must have been a daunting task! Good acting by Melissa George and the rest of the cast, but her haunting performance takes center stage very quickly as the movie goes on a WTF / Twilight Zone-ish mode. All in all I recommend it, I really enjoyed it and it kept me guessing the whole time so if you like unconventional, mind-f*** movies, this is one for you!",Triangle
216,rachelsmithliverpool,I just love it,8,12 February 2021,I love this movie. It's just a great concept. A rewatch can sometimes be necessary to grasp the whole film and a deeper look into the ending only makes the watch more satisfying. A thrilling tale that surprised me throughout.,Triangle
217,peterdavis,So much better than it had any right to be!,8,3 November 2015,"Not to sound down on Melissa George or anyone else involved, but I recorded ""Triangle"" when it premiered (in Australia - straight to TV, it seems) just after midnight back in April and finally got around to what I thought would be a 10-minute view (ie: from opening scene till my first sigh and/or eye-rolling, before quickly deleting it from the PVR in ""what-was-I-thinking"" disgust). Yes, I knew it was a long-shot gamble when I took the immense trouble to hover over the listing, read the synopsis, and press a button to record it. But I try to live on the edge. It looked like a version of ""Dead Calm"" crossed with a teen slasher movie. A short ways into it I thought it might turn out even worse, that most terrible of things: a haunted boat mystery.Turns out it was kinda both, but in a fresh way that quickly reveals how clever it has been conceived while it lulled you in with its competently filmed but unremarkable set-up. This may be where it lost many, more-impatient viewers. And it's not that it's groundbreaking in using its particular plot device (say no more) but it ramps everything up thereafter with increasing tension and revelations. It shook me from my jaded, generation-x-pectations and filled me with suspense and delight. In the end you have to admire, as much as enjoy, this spooky little puzzle.Try not to be distracted by Queensland locations standing in for Triangle's Florida setting, or by some varying accents. Melissa George manages to suspend disbelief in a difficult role and a difficult emotional-range to sustain for a whole movie, especially while wearing short-shorts, big heals and a wet shirt. Will have to check out more films by writer/director, Christopher Smith.",Triangle
218,gas911-1,"A Hell Of A Ride, Clichéd and Anti-climactic, but a Very Good Thriller.",7,5 March 2010,"The less you know about this movie the better. Due to its poor marketing, Triangle isn't quite going to receive the substantial credit it deserves. It's a thriller so ridiculously written, that it's actually very smart. Anti-climactic can't describe the turn of events this movie takes you through. But the more far-fetched and cynical the movie gets, the more flat out captivating and thrilling it becomes. It balances it's horror/thriller/drama elements quite well, and when Triangle f*cks with your head there's no going back. Not as genius planned out as say, Momento, but it's still, for the most part, a hell of an achievement. What looks like a simple story unravels and flips you through many bazaar encounters and is very unpredictable in what's going to happen next. Some of the big scares and badly directed, but Triangle is well paced making it an atmospherical thriller for those who want to embark and great and well thought out thriller.Having said that, Triangle bumps into every horror cliché around. The ringing of the door bell, record player, the list in bottomless. The acting is OK, no performances dazzle but nothing here makes you cringe, same goes for the script. Chris Smith's direction at times is clever, but others ineffective this many irrelevant little polishes. It's anti- climactic tone will mess with some reviewers, and the movie does go on a little too long. Overall: Embarks on every horror cliché in this anti-climactic thriller. But this is one hell of a ride and a very good thriller, and seemingly underrated. But you really have to concentrate.",Triangle

Though i have to admit Christopher smith (Director) has take another forward step in making thrillers after ""Creep"" and ""Severance"", Best of luck to him.Overall all i recommend is this to be watched on a night in weekday when one does not have anything to do or just looking for some average thriller.",Triangle

Comparisons can be made to ""Memento"" in that both play around with the concept of time (I don't think that's a spoiler), but then again, it's nothing like ""Memento"". That said, this movie features a really smart script and after all, isn't that what a good movie should start with.there's nothing as it seems in this movie and it will take you places you never imagined.

224,robertobasilico,"Pretty good film, some plot incongruence must be put in evidence though",7,25 November 2010,"Despite at first sight I felt it was the obvious movie about friends lost and killed, like the previous movie of the director, which was a laugh riot rather than an horror, I have to say watching it that it caught my attention and especially my critic side.I won't spend time saying the acting was good, photography and editing as well, pretty good soundtrack, but what I found in this movie, discussing with a friend of mine was:first of all, the protagonist follow a straight time line from the beginning of the ship sequence to its end (the death of her while she was masked), and it comprehend 3 and I underline, 3 times the ship comes back. So... if the times where just 3, how could the red haired woman been death so much time, and how could have been written so many papers and so many lost collar? If it was a never ending sequence, like this elements suggest, the ship would have been rather full of people trying to kill each other, don't you think? beside the fact that the repeating sequence didn't valid for the other guys on the ship, who where not so many, and most of all: have you ever seen two masked guy on the ship? the answer is NO.second: I would have conceived that once the protagonist would have come back to the island the time line started again to be ""straight"" rather than circular. I didn't get the birds on the reef and most of all, I didn't get the fact that with a surrealistic act, the protagonist appear ALIVE"" after being in a death frame with her child. Where the hell she came from? that sound non sense to me mostly because if we assume that the time is circular even on the island, so... how could it be linear?, I mean... it is a complete chaos, the protagonist wouldn't even get old in this way.Third: I don't get where it all started from. Since the movie seems not to complain any mental disorder or coma status of the protagonist, I don't get the beginning why the story happen, does she have to understand something? it doesn't seems so. Does she have to die? So why?... Is she trapped with the fact that she doesn't want to accept the death of his child? so why there seem not such to be a cathartic moment...at times I think that the plot choices for the actors are just weird and doesn't seem to contemplate all the options of action.I mean, comparing this movie with Inception, I couldn't find a logic a math formula to interpret it. Even Donnie Darko talk about time line, but still referring to a straight line. In Triangle the Director pretended to much from the plot and end it with a tail bite. I preferred a car accident death with the ending title rather than the taxi driver, because, if you think about it as a curse, this would have been happen once the girl beaten her child, not on the ship... but at that time the time was straight, so she might chose NOT to go on the ship again...I would like to have some comment on it because I didn't find any good comments on the plot which I would like have!

225,grim2005,Absolutely Worth Watching,10,11 September 2016,"I would say it is best to go into this movie with as little knowledge about it as possible. Thus, I will simply say that I'd highly recommend this movie if you like good horror movies, movies that require some thought, and are OK with movies that might be somewhat ambiguous (or possibly just difficult to fully figure out.) It's not very hard to follow, but can be daunting to figure out the larger picture.And just so you know, definitely make sure you pay attention while watching. It tends not to be boring, and once it gets moving it should keep your attention, but you still need to keep your eyes for various clues that pop up. This is the sort of movie which raises a lot of questions early on and answers them in due time, and has many clues to the larger picture.As someone who likes horror and mindf**k movies, this is definitely one of my favorite movies.

226,mugwamp-983,A review from the other side,8,24 April 2014,"Absolutely a diamond in the rough. If you like looping paradoxes... you know like Butterfly Effect, 12 Monkeys or Groundhog Day, OK Groundhog Day is a comedy, this is a horror. My point is this film does the looping paradox very well. This is a difficult thing to do. The story has to be water tight as people will pick up on inconsistencies between repeats. Triangle does a good job of plugging the holes. For example, if a character drops ""something"", and the story loops several times, then there should already be a pile of these ""things"" in that location, and sure enough there is.Its not just the Butterfly Effect mystery at play here. In fact its not about time in the linear sense at all. There is a bit of the Shining, mixed with some slasher B movie blood, guts and mayhem. The action does come to a head, with a much needed change of location where answers are provided by this new perspective. And the questions one may have are answered in such a way you might say: ""ok I get it""The secret is to view this movie without expecting much. Should you go in with high expectations you could be disappointed. After all, it is what it is in scope and budget. Even so, the set is convincing, the acting is quite satisfactory. Don't be surprised, if after viewing this movie you search for answers on the internet. There are some interesting hypothesis, and opposing interpretations of this movie out there. That in itself is a testament to a film that entertains on different levels at once.",Triangle
227,RageQuitLeigh,All reviews will spoil it. Just Watch.,8,13 February 2021,"Before watching this movie I started glimpsing over a few reviews and found one that essentially said stop reading reviews as they will spoil it and having now watched the movie I'm glad I took that advice.The premise of the movie follows Jess who is a weary mother taking a day off from looking after her son to go sailing with a group that includes a friend. Following destruction of their boat during a storm, drifting along they chance upon a cruise liner where they take refuge. Once boarded it appears vacant but things are not as they seem.This movie is a psychological thriller that is well paced. It has clues from beginning to end and therefore it is very enjoyable to follow along, unlike some movies that make your head hurt trying to work out exactly what is happening. The answers are fairly straight forward if you pay attention and you are rewarded for doing so.On seeing the casting I did not have high hopes and it was one of the things that made me over look this movie in the past. That being said I thought the acting was particularly good, especially from the lead role portrayed by Melissa George. She was able to hit the emotional turmoil required and added a lot to the overall movie. However, I suspect that having seen the movie was not a commercial success had it had 1 or 2 notable actors in the lead roles that it would have been a major success and would be looked upon more favorably also. So for me it is a classic case of overachieving and limitation of the budget along with clout of the film makers.All in all this is a good hidden gem of a movie that is well made, well thought out, looks good and is well acted by the lead actor. Well worth a watch.",Triangle

The story definitely revolved around her.In the last 10 min a lot of the purpose was revealed but even then there were a few holes that were left unresolved.

What I ended up watching was a very good mystery thriller, with a great story and very good acting. Sure, there is blood and people do die, but it's not over the top violence just for violence's sake.The story, which starts pretty slow, follows a group of friends who go sailing, get caught in a storm and their boat is turned upside down. But they soon find one big, empty cruise liner and they think they are saved. The perspective then shifts to Jess, and we follow her for the rest of the story. It quickly becomes clear that something is wrong. It's a feeling that get transmitted to the audience and it doesn't go away for the rest of the film.The movie does leave some questions unanswered, and while some people may find that annoying, in my opinion it's better this way that to try to come up with bad or story-ruining explanations.",Triangle

The acting was fantastic and I have to give props to all the people who made this movie because this looks like a hard to make. I thought at first when all the people are dying that this is a typical horror, but then there boat sinks again and they are on the ship again.

The main protagonist is the potential girlfriend for the boat captain who is mostly unfamiliar and therefore untrustworthy to the rest of the friends. I could explain the plot but that would give away too much and honestly it is better going into the movie blind.

I spent most of the movie trying to work out what was going on, trying to piece together all the elements of the storyline. Christopher Smith has clearly spent a long time putting this film together with an intricately crafted deal of detail. I was gripped from the moment the yacht capsized.The lead performance is excellent, superbly holding the plot together; and the supporting cast are more than passable.

The plot will have you thinking it over and over, so I recommend reading through some of the message board posts once you've watched it.If you like neat, tidy endings, give this one a miss.It's extremely well made and, considering the complex interweaving of the supernatural, space-time and Greek mythology, it is amazingly plotted.

Seemingly abandoned, it doesn't take long before their already dire situation starts to get worse when they find there is someone else on the ship hunting them down.This was a very curious film: when it started repeating itself it put me off immediately as I am not a fan of having to sit through a given number of scenes on a loop (I didn't even like Groundhog Day.) What's the point of it, really? So very strangely enough: I wasn't really enjoying this movie at all.And it was literally at the end of it, where Melissa George is staring at the car wreck did it smack me hard in the face: it is a nightmare, it is hell. Simple, and pure as that. And that awful feeling I had was what I feel, in my unconscious state, when I am having a nightmare myself; it's that feeling of dread, of fear, of knowing that what you're going through and feeling and experiencing is not real yet in that deadening cold pit of your stomach you start to have doubts and as your nightmare progresses your terror soars.Only thing is: when I wake up, relief swiftly comes along; this is not the case with George's character as this is her very real nightmare, her hell, her punishment; and she will never have any reprieve. At the start, when they board the ship, they talk of a man named Sisyphus; he was a man in Greek mythology as they explained who was cursed to an eternity of pushing a rock up a hill only for it to roll back down again. And so it is for George; she has to endure the agony of her last day alive, really, over and over again, with no end in sight as her own punishment.While I suppose it had its fair share of predictable plot twists, and the supporting cast perhaps wasn't the best, the overall product is a very good one, and it really, really made me think; the neat little clues they dropped throughout were also fun when you caught them (for instance: the Sisyphus reference and the sign reading 'Goodbye - Please Return.') And I still can't get over how it managed to gut-punch me the way it did – not many other movies have done that to me.If you're wanting an interesting, thought-twisting movie, watch this one; it will also teach you to be truly grateful when you manage to wake from your next nightmare.",Triangle

When on the ship she notices all the lockets that gathered at the bottom showing how many times she's re-tried and relived everything, it kind of reminds me of the Bermuda triangle mysteries people speak about in books ...

246,fortean2,Best brain-teaser I've seen for a long time,10,19 March 2010,"I viewed this movie with no expectations whatsoever (except that it was a slasher movie with a difference) and found it to be excellent and most certainly NOT 'just' a slasher movie, it's a heck of a lot more than that such as suspense thriller, mystery and other elements which I won't mention to avoid spoiling any surprises.And to those who say there are plot-holes - there aren't but it can appear that way if you've missed one of the plot points. The story is extremely well constructed and the writer/director Christopher Smith deserves some recognition for his efforts here. Major kudos to the cinematographer too as it looks great and is very atmospheric.The movie really draws you in and rewards those who pay attention throughout (not hard to do as it's very intriguing) - just don't expect any easy answers, but DO expect to have something to think on and chat about once it's over. You'll then want to watch it again to pick up on anything that you missed and to enjoy the brilliant story-telling.A first class film that deserves far more attention from the movie-going, DVD-buying masses.10/10",Triangle
247,Bobby747,Horrible movie,2,18 December 2010,"I watched this movie on netflix, thinking it would be at least okay given its 3/5 star rating, and the fact that I tend to enjoy supernatural horrors. Little did I surmise that the movie was riddled with weak characters, dialogue, and the central character herself was infuriating. There are two factors to this movie that almost make it not painful to watch and they are the concept behind the plot, and the cinematography. There was probably a span of about 10 minutes, just after the half-way mark, of the movie that I actually found it interesting to watch.It appears like the filmmakers had a good idea for a movie and ran with it before fully thinking it through. It is a good example of representing a time-line, given special circumstances, however I found myself utterly disinterested in whose time-line it was, due to the extremely weak dialogue, and horrendous characters (especially the central character).Usually, I wouldn't even bother doing a review of a movie I didn't really like, but I will review a movie that I hate. This movie was truly bad.2/10: 1 point for concept (only one because the concept is rendered uninteresting very quickly due to major conflicting flaws)1 point for the cinematography (It was on par with most average-budget thrillers, but it was nothing spectacular).",Triangle

Gosh. No emotion, no mystery, that's all boredom. The others actors are OK, not good nor bad.Then the plot ; well at first I was quite intrigued : the location is quite unusual(a ship) and I was curious to see how the director would use the son's autistic syndrome and the mother's paranoia. I recommend you not to see how, it doesn't worth it.This movie reminds me the ""saw"" movies in the way that it is reshowing complete parts of the previous films.

Dialogs that never touch the subject that one should touch when confronted with a situation like the folks in this movie.The main reason I kept watching - while doing something else - was that I wanted to know the final solution being thrown upon the audience. An audience of which the director obviously thinks it consists of idiots...Of course a strong storyline with a few twists can be enough..Sure, the ending gives some clue as to what has happened, but without explaining and that is a good thing. Stories like these should not have a proper explanation. The mystery should remain...But really, I think that most men watching this forgettable flick do it because of Melissa George.

253,thealefmagnus,The film that is always not what you think it is.,8,19 September 2013,"Triangle is one of those hidden gems in the Thriller genre, you've long given up on. Although mostly regarded as a horror movie, this flick leans more on the psychological thriller subgenre. I first saw it back in 2009 and reviewed it a few nights ago only to still be mesmerized by how well it was executed. I could still remember how I felt when I first saw the movie alone, on my laptop. I did a solo, standing ovation like literally and I'm not even kidding.What's all the hype? Written by director Christopher Smith (Creep, Severance), you just know it's not going to be your regular horror flick. Smartly written and visually stunning for a horror movie, this is not a campy have-sex-you'll-be-the-first-to-die type of slashers. It takes so much skill and effort to write a screenplay like this one. I'll put the early reputation of my reviews on IMDb on the line by saying it can match to 2004's cult hit, time travel Sundance movie, Primer. As the director Smith claims, THERE ARE NO Plot holes. You're gonna be spending days trying to understand the movie and trying to find a plot hole which just speaks of how smart it was done.I recommend watching this movie blind of all presumptions. Don't watch the trailer. Don't read a synopsis. Hell, stop reading this review as it may soon giveaway bits of the film. Trust me, the experience will be much satisfying if you knew nothing of it other than it is a thriller for crying out loud. Here goes - The Vague Non-Spoiler Synopsis: Single mother Jess (Melissa George) goes sailing with Greg (Michael Dorman) and a few friends until they get stuck in the middle of the ocean when the winds dropped down on them. A freak electrical storm is fast approaching and it's only a matter of time before it overturns the yacht. When a mysterious cruise ship arrives, they thought they were finally safe. The horrors are just about to start.Reading from that synopsis, it is easy to assume that it's the perfect recipe for a slasher flick. Survivors thinking they are rescued only to find out there is more danger ahead of them. In just a few minutes in, bodies start dropping like flies and you'll be wondering what the rest of the movie would be like. Only then do you get to a point wherein you'd say ""What the F just happened?"" succeeded with a ""No way!"" Trapped in an empty ship and pursued by an unknown assailant, Jess has to survive the horror so she can come home to her child. With the stellar performance of Australian actress Melissa George, Triangle will be a ride you'd repeat over and over.Triangle will always be one of the most discussed and debated movies on IMDb. You'll find yourself scouring for answers after a few minutes of taking in what has happened when it ended. This movie is continuously growing to be a cult/underground hit as more people are seeing it and comparing it to mind f*ck giants like Inception and Primer.(If it helps, you'd see Liam Hemsworth back when he wasn't the big name that he is now because of The Hunger Games) Note: Back in 2009, the film only had a 5.9 rating on IMDb. As of the current score, it has now grown to 6.8 which is high enough for a horror/thriller picture.writelikesundance.wordpress.com",Triangle

Everything seems real uncomfortable and ""off."" You don't find out anything about the cruise ship like where it came from and what happened. No one is on it. That would have actually been interesting. Lead actress runs around killing them all, over and over, and we don't really get told why. For some reason if she kills them she gets to go home.

In short, there are three different stages on the ship, and all these stages come into a loop. After watching, I have a feeling that knowing what'll happen is even more macabre than being aware of nothing. And sometimes it is better to give up. What I think is the most wonderful is that at the end of this movie, the driver spoke as if he was the death god in the above story. By the way, the heroine is attractive.",Triangle

257,rick-992,"Not bad, but not brilliant by any means.",6,20 October 2009,"I certainly agree with other reviewers that Melissa George in the lead role of Jess really does an excellent job. And I also agree that the film is worth a look, but I'm afraid I wasn't too impressed with the storytelling and plot.After their yacht capsizes, 5 friends find themselves seemingly rescued by a cruise liner named Aeolus. One of the group remarks that in mythology, Aeolus was the father of Sisyphus you can look him up if you want a clue as to the film's theme.Jess is immediately uncomfortable and it's not long before her trepidation seems to have been warranted. She suffers disturbing dejá vù as the plot unfolds, and faces a number of increasingly difficult choices. We rarely doubt that Jess will make the difficult choice if it means a chance of escape from the nightmare. In a perverse way the choices become easier as it dawns on Jess what is happening.The movie is definitely a thriller, not a horror. Although there is quite a lot of blood! Personally I was glad there were no ""boo!"" moments where you jump out of your skin. The writer had many opportunities to do that but clearly chose not to turn the movie into just another bad-guy-jumps-out flick. But this doesn't mean that the movie lacks suspense! There's plenty of suspense and I was tense (in a good way) almost throughout.Towards the end, the pieces all start falling into place, and a few odd and inexplicable moments at the start of the film, which made me wonder what the heck the writer was thinking of, suddenly made perfect sense. As the final scenes unfolded I felt very much more satisfied than at any other time during the film. The ending is very neat and tidy, and clever too. It left me grinning.But overall this neatness and feeling of completeness didn't make up for what had gone before. As a total package it just wasn't as good as it could have been, perhaps because the main plot device has been done before, and in my opinion, done much better by others. I'll give it 6/10.I'm sure that others in the sparsely populated theatre liked it much less than I did: I overheard several damning comments when the titles rolled which I felt were pretty harsh. If you're looking for a bloody and frightening horror, this movie isn't it.*** SPOILER ALERT *** I'm not going to ruin the film for you, but I will say that the forever-repeating never-ending loop scenario has, in my opinion, been done much better elsewhere. Groundhog Day, 50 First Dates, and others I haven't seen, plus a myriad of sci-fi shows such as Star Trek and Stargate. However it's truthful to say that Jess finds herself in an altogether more disturbing scenario than any of these others mentioned! *** END OF SPOILER ***",Triangle
258,jonny-pears,Fantastic but plot holes.,7,25 January 2021,"SPOILERS!
I really enjoyed this movie. I Saw it 10 years ago and always wanted to watch it again but never really got around to it. Finally watched it again and I still find it to be a brilliant, well written movie with impressive acting and gripping until the very end. SPOILERS COMING UP!There are some plot holes where I could be wrong with but I just don't understand. Movies these days tell us (rightfully) that a time loop or going back in time can be tricky but one thing for certain is if you kill your past self, your present self would also die or simply cease to exist. Because the main character( Jess )wouldn't have the chance to make her wrongs ( due to being killed by her future self ) none of the events of the movie would actually happen. So that's a big one for me.
Secondly the other issue is the placement of objects/bodies. I understand the triangle theory in this movie ( clue is in the name of the cruise liner )but there simply isn't enough bodies where they should be based on the number of repeats that have occurred. Victors body is only seen once so makes no sense and he meets Jess a few times after his major injury. So must die in the same place as we see. Multiple times. Meaning when the cast first walk in this room, they would be greeted by many bodies of the same person/s. Yet there aren't any bodies when he dies...or anyone else's. And later when Jess is using the shotgun, we never see a host of victor/sally bodies. Bare in mind sally has bodies in 2 different locations of the cruise liner as a he movie shows.But let me tell you, the movie is still fantastic. It's a brain twister that makes you think even with my spoilers(obviously better without) but it lacks conviction in a few places that I mentioned. But it's still a must watch even after these years and I'll happily watch it again. Even if it is another 10 years away.Good watch.",Triangle

This movie has a great premise, and I really do think it could have been enjoyable if the title character had been a little more interesting. ""Jess"" as played by Melissa George, is flat and uninteresting in the beginning of the movie. We don't find out why until the end of the movie, but by that time I wasn't actually very invested. The supporting characters weren't developed enough for us to actually care about what was happening to them and that was sad. I was actually surprised by how fast they were picked off. I understand that's needed to really move the storyline along, but it made me completely uninterested in their fate, and not really very interested in Melissa George's character either.

Christopher gave us a very imaginative, original, complex and entertaining story that goes full circle and after 2 hrs of film, he makes you realize the ""twist"" to the story happened at the beginning, not at the end. Then, there's Melissa George who provides a great performance. She's not new, she's had a couple of nominations including a golden globe. She offers a great performance on this movie and she's for sure a name to track in the future. I can't wait to see what new thriller is Smith bringing us, and I can't wait to see Melissa on new roles.",Triangle

Even,stars weren't the best ,story was great.Scriptwriter had written great story.At first of the film,film as a ordinary but after they had come to ship ,events surprised me.Specially Jess who was Melissa George in film surprised me. I said that there were somebody else in ship but jess was in ship. While I was watching film ,I thought ''If I were she''.I said that what do I do ,If I were she?It was very bad situation as vicious circle. I slog to follow events so events confused.

The film plays some fun games with logic and weirdness. I don't know if I'd call it a horror movie or a science fiction movie. There really wasn't anything scientific about it, but it does have ""Twilight Zone"" quality to it. There is a great deal of blood, but it doesn't quite fit into horror. The acting was great, and the photography was beautiful. I felt that some threads of the plot were much too thin, like the reason why the killer started killing, which isn't ever justified in any rational way, but the direction suggests that we should understand it. Those weaknesses are forgivable, though, and almost acceptable in the confused reality scenario in which the film takes place.",Triangle

295,caitlinthompson-03016,One of the Worst!,1,23 July 2018,"I absolutely hated this movie. In the beginning and up until they climbed aboard the ship, a ship btw way as we the viewers could tell was uninhabited but still it was fairly interesting but then it went downhill. I figured out after not too long, that the Jess character was in a time loop of some kind. Who had apparently never saw the movie, Groundhog Day was my first thought.But really, it was very repetitive with her going through this loop time and again but finally near the end of the movie, she seemed to have beat it and finds herself washed up on a beach, with the outfit she had been wearing when she killed all the people she'd been yachting with, floating nearby.This Jess character also annoyed me. When trying to explain to the others what was happening she never ever used the phrase stuck in a time-loop. She knew that's what was happening, but instead she whined and cried and said things like, ""we have to get off this ship"" or ""you have to kill the others"" or ""There's two of me, two of you"", Or again, 
""You have to believe me we need to get off this ship!"" But she never tried to give them any real explanation as to why.Then she makes it back home and then realized her other self was there. And her other self was not a nice or a good mother, so she kills her, I guess thinking that will break the time loop or something. Then she grabs her son and leaves in her car only to get involved in a car accident.We see her dead on the ground and her little boy also dead, but then we see a taxi driver who says he will give her a ride. She tells him to take her to the harbor.She meets those same people and I kept expecting her to tell them she changed her mind and wasn't going but no way. She gets on the boat with them and that's the end.I mean seriously? So basically she's going to go through the same thing all over again. There's more to the story then this but I'm not going to make this any longer than it already is. Just read the others reviews. All in all, I do not recommend this movie.",Triangle

297,pocodfe,Very enlightening and refreshing...in some ways,8,17 January 2012,"Never heard of this movie, never read a thing about it at all...just happened to stumble upon it on a movie channel right at the opening credits.It's fun going into a movie with no expectation of what it's about at all. Things get weird after just about two minutes into the film, drawing you in very early for an intriguing, yet, admittedly, confusing journey. This is one film you must watch more than once. Anyone who acts like or types a review on this film and sound like they have some explanation on perfect cue is lying. NO ONE could get everything nailed down after watching this film just once, and even after several repeated viewings, you'd walk away clueless on some things, UNLESS you did internet research.SPOILER ALERT: For example, the closing scenes in the movie, when Jess has the car accident, and emerges totally unscathed, yet, her son, as we are told by a cab driver who is IN FRONT of her car, makes no sense. The cabby actually tells her her son ""had no chance."" I thought to myself, ""how could he possible know?"" So, at that point, I was like ""this cabby is weird...what is going on?"" Upon my next viewing of the film, I deduced somehow, the cabby is involved and is more than a regular cabby. It wasn't until I did further research that I learned who the cabby really was, but why should I, or anyone for that matter, have to do research to understand a movie? The only complaint I have about so many of today's films is that half the movie is left to view subjecture and theory. Sure, more clarity is needed in this film, but without a doubt, it is a thriller in a refreshing way, and has become a favorite film of mine, even if it is confusing at times.

This review is free of spoiler alerts, so go ahead and read it :)The movie starts with a group (a couple, 2 friends and a mid aged woman(Heroine)) going on a sea sailing in a small boat for having some fun. They get caught in the middle of a storm and gets stranded in the middle of the sea with a sinking boat. Suddenly a large cruise ship comes into view and they get into the ship. To their surprise the ship is deserted and they start to search it to find anyone. Suddenly a figure with sack covered face and a shotgun appears from nowhere and starts shooting at them. The group gets separated and one by one people being to die.The heroine escapes from the gunman and to her surprise when everyone else dies, the time beings to rotate and the ship stops and she sees herself and her friends stranded in the sea in a sinking boat and they get into the ship and the whole killings and activities repeat again! The whole process repeats again and again and the story continues as to how the heroine fights her way out of the loop and finds out who the sacked gunman is.The movie is filled with twists and turns all around and keeps you in the edge of the seat all the while.

300,Scooby52,Could have been better,5,27 August 2013,"Time travel movies, or those that introduce the 'what if' scenario always intrigue me. They can be hit or miss a lot of the time, and sadly this falls into the miss category.The premise is interesting enough, a group become stranded when their Yacht overturns in the ocean. When a cruise liner comes by they board it, but the ships not what it seems. Suddenly, the group seem in a situation where they encounter a duplicate of one of their own, and go through timewarp which sees them relive the same circumstances again and again.Without saying too much more to give away spoilers, the actions from the main character Jess (Melissa George) are quite absurd at times, and the character herself is extremely unlikeable. Having a protagonist you don't care about in such a thriller (and thus not care whether she lives and dies) is the first mistake. The other is it becomes obvious at around the 30 minute mark where the film is going, and the conclusion is inevitable. A good psychological thriller should stay one step ahead of the audience, not the other way round.The other problem I had with the film were the performances. The cast is all Australian, but for some reason the director entrusted them all to play the parts with American accents. Some of these attempts, particularly Emma Lung, are just appalling. While others like Michael Dorman seem to switch back forth between the American and Aussie accents. As an Australian myself, it would have been a lot better if they were allowed to use their native tongue, instead of poorly done accents, or just hired American actors if they wanted to appeal to the domestic US audience. The results in this film are just a distraction.",Triangle

Personally I found the main character, Jess incredibly hard to look at so I struggled to feel sympathetic towards her.

The main character's lack of emotion was annoying and just made me dislike her.I guess every single ""twist"" before it happened. Yes, every single one. That's because there was nothing new here. It was like watching a list of cliques being played out. The time repeat stuff could have been OK but the way it was done left nothing to the imagination.

305,JorritM,Overrated and dumb,3,13 February 2016,"I watched this movie with a friend of mine, as we both enjoy intelligent plots, mystery films, and occasional horror. Three things that were advertised to be hallmarks of this movie. Examples of movies with relatively intelligent plots and interwoven story lines I enjoyed are Twelve Monkeys, Primer, Memento, Coherence, etc. Movies I didn't enjoy, but were similarly advertised, are for example The Village by Shyamalan, Inception, and I Origins.Just to be clear: this movie is part of latter list. Don't believe what other reviewers might tell you here: the plot is superficial, the whole movie is entirely predictable, and it's internally inconsistent. I didn't mind the premise, and I am well able to suspend my disbelief, but this movie was a clear, thorough disappointment. If you're looking for a nice mystery thriller of the type similar to the movies I mentioned above, don't watch this. It's horrible. Its stupidity is at times forgivable, at others nerve-wrecking. Most of the choices the main character makes are completely ludicrous and no well thinking human being with an IQ over 80 would ever consider what she does in the movie. The actions by the main character are only put in the script in an attempt to make the movie logically consistent, but unfortunately it fails miserably. The plot of this movie has more holes than swiss cheese. And I like swiss cheese. But I didn't like this movie.

But the progress of the time loop cycles around a whopping huge and bottomless plot hole that flushes away anything good about this film. I found it infuriating to watch.

I also don't get why this movie (or ""Devil"" for that matter) made it to IMDb recent underrated horror films list by Keith. People - seriously!lThis movie is actually one of the worst horror flicks I have seen in a long time. So bad that I needed to get it out of my system by writing this review - which is like my - third only or something. AS I NEED TO WARN OTHERS NOT TO WASTE THEIR TIME ON THIS!The acting was fairly decent all round - and so was the setting (on the sea is used too rarely I think) and the overall feel of the movie. The effects are decent - but the entire premise of the movie is simply a recurring series of loops within loops - resulting in even bigger... well, loops. It seems like this was made for the sole purpose of justify a 'do you get the big picture of this picture' ending. Only problem is - yes - I got it! It was bloody obvious that the end was meant to justify the means - an endless sequence designed to keep the living dead on the edge of their seats. Its like a pimped wannabe horror version of ""Memento"" composed by a one track minded script writer with a fetish for plot twists - except he actually forgets the plot. Instead the movie goes nuts and overboard on the twists. Then the director and editors tries to carry it home by camouflaging the entire train wreck as a roller-coaster ghost- ride of a absent-minded schizophrenic and cursed heroine.The premise of deja-vus completely fails itself with the recurring ""Oh - now I remember and know what to do's"" (which becomes tedious) and the only outcome is that one feels increasingly alienated from the protagonist. The heroine becomes more of an antagonist - and altogether this movie may impress those easily impressed by anything new - no matter the lack of quality and consistency in the script.1/10 - maybe it could get 1 star more - but need to 'keep it real' and counterweight the overenthusiastic fan reviews in here (must be the movie team with family and friends).Seriously, save your time for something worth watching. Like ""The Ruins"" or ""1408"" also on Keith Simanton's otherwise decent list. My recommendation for an alternative 'on water' horror / suspense flick would be the excellent ""Dead Calm"" directed by Ray Ingram (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097162/)Do yourself a big favor and watch that instead - and leave this to rot at the bottom of the Bermuda Triangle!",Triangle
311,patalbright2,Good intense movie,8,22 March 2010,"The movie 'Triangle' is someways tries to create the eeriness and sublime horror of the black and white cult classic ""Carnival of Souls"". Somewhere along the line someone juxtaposed the creepy 60's classic into this screenplay and have done a masterful job which is outside the current gore theme of most of today's horror flicks. I have yet to see a review in which anyone put the 2 together but Candace Hilligoss performance in Souls as the dead but not so dead Mary Henry caught in some ultracreepy timewarp, compares easily to Melissa George's solid character. I agree that you never get to know Jess and I believe this was intended perhaps to distance her from Mary Henry. With ""Souls"" everyone watching the film knows Mary is really dead except her and we get to follow her along as she begins to discover this herself. In the case of Jess, it's intended that we are aloof as we follow along as she tried to unravel the past to prevent the future-the death of her son. I have only seen this movie once so some of the more sublime issues I have yet to discover. I will watch again to find the nuisances other reviewers have pointed out. I will be looking for a focal-point for the movie as was the 'Dance of the dead' towards the end of 'Carnival of souls"". This movie is without copyright as is free at many places on the net.

312,kylejamescampbell,Innovatively Incredible.,9,5 January 2011,"On purchasing this film on DVD I was expecting a cliché horror flick. I half expected a simple storyline, one in which each character was killed of one by one, and in the end up the main lovable character survives within an inch of his/her life, in other words a typical gore fest. This is not what I got, at all. What I got was an innovative, creative and unique. Triangle isn't really your classical horror film but more of a psychological thriller. The main character Jess (Melissa George) is a single mother with an autistic son, she is convinced by her friend to take a day off and join him and some friends on a sailing trip for the day. On their adventure they enter a freak electrical storm and their boat is capsized. They then aboard a passing ocean liner, which they realise when on board, is rural and empty. And Jess seems to believe she has been on the ship before. From then on mysterious and strange things occur, Jess finds her keys that were left on the capsized boat, and the group are stalked by a masked figure. What happens then on after makes this film truly brilliant. The gang end up trapped in a time loop of repetition, which they can't seem to escape. Jess is the only survivor of the first loop of events and spends her time there on after trying to break free from every other loop in order to survive. Ending in a grim and shocking manner. This is by far Christopher Smith's best direction, the script is brilliantly written and the performances from each actor are brilliant. Melissa Green's performance in particular was fearless and credible, and very well believable. It's a smartly constructed horror movie. I was suitably shaken by this picture and must praise Smith for creating some real shivers. A highly applauded movie that the majority of reviewers enjoyed, if you are looking for a jumping out your seat, cringing style of horror movie look away. If you want a movie that will play with your mind and throw everything it can at you to twist the reality and the things you see around you then watch.

313,masterandcommander,Two-thirds of a fantastic movie.,7,8 February 2013,"This movie is worth watching. However, the entire first act needs to be nothing short of tolerated. It is a very terrible set up. This is mostly due to this movie possessing terrible character designs and a sub-par ensemble of actors.Yet, this movie takes off. As soon as the actual premise drops, which is not immediately apparent during the first act, the movie became very watchable. It has a lot of fun with its premise and features an excellent 2nd act that is great.Towards the end, the movie kind of loses its direction and leaves on a sort of whimper. It does not do much with its great concept but it is still a great concept.In the end, the movie was an excellent idea for a movie and where it really counts it did pretty well with what it was setting out to accomplish. The problem is the misguided opening which is slow, useless, and has literally no connection with the rest of the movie. The ending didn't do much to tie everything together. The movie feels confused. It also features rather poor performances from all but the lead lady who is only average.Stronger performances, a tighter 1st act, a more cohesive finale, and perhaps more solid visuals would have cemented the impact for this movie. I believe that if it had given us more information about the protagonist earlier than the movie would have earned more points. Instead we are given a rather forced twist and this is all revealed far too late for us to care. Instead, the opening is misleading and very poorly acted and long-winded. As it is, this movie is interesting and somewhat original but lacks the real punch. Well-conceived but poorly implemented. Worth the watch but definitely lower your expectations.",Triangle

It is a mind tangling, heart bursting and utterly fearful underrated masterpiece. Now where to start with the review? I'm going to try to not spoil anything, you get a better reaction from this movie if you know nothing about it.Acting. The acting in Triangle is very impressive. The leading lady, Melissa George takes on the role of a single mother named Jess caring for her young autistic son, but is suddenly plunged into a spiral of chaos as soon as the main plot jumps forward. I stereo-typed Melissa as an ex soap opera actress, which is what she is, but she shows us that she has grown in the many other projects she has worked on. She carries the movie pretty much on her own and she does so very well. It's hard for any actor to do that, it's often easier being able to fall back on another leading character but she does not have that luxury, and to be honest I'm glad of that. The other actors provide an exceedingly decent performance considering they're all supporting actors and actresses. Triangle has a list of B-list actors but they all prove to us they are worthy of being up there with the best.Plot. This will be quite short because I don't want to ruin anything! The plot is very, very smart. When it first starts, you plan out in your head what will happen but then the outcome will be something very different. There are many twists and turns that glue you down to your seat, stunned in awe. Any plot-holes the file has are often cleaned up as the film moves on. Set. I was very impressed with the set, they captured everything very well. The CGI is as good as anything else, sometimes it's easy to spot out fake looking props or special effects but everything in Triangle looked pretty god damn realistic. Sets that constructed and not added using computer graphic technology were also very well made. We don't forget where we are because of how accurate they are. Everything is so detailed, it's shocking!I think I've said enough. The bottom line from me is that you should see this movie, and you should do so knowing little about it! Don't even watch the trailer if you haven't seen it yet, I got lucky because I saw the trailer in August and it's only just come out in England yesterday, October 16th so I had pretty much forgotten everything about it. Triangle will take your mind and tangle it but still let you understand what is going on, which is a tough thing to do when making these psychological horror and thriller films. They can be clever but they can also lose you, Triangle keeps you all the way to the end. Watch it, I insist.",Triangle

You don't care about the fate of any of the characters, including the protagonist, and the plot has enough holes to sink a ship (pun intended).

322,phunkysquirrel-1,Great performances and camera-work. The script is uninspired.,4,22 December 2009,"The actor performances are, on the whole good. We cannot fault the individual scripting. However as the movie progresses, we view more previous cuts and some bizarre scenes of the disbelieving protagonists when the scene makes you scream, ""Come on, aren't you finding this a bit strange?"" Melissa George plays her part excellently. I'd nominate her performance. Additionally, I feel some chemistry between her and Michael Dorman. As such, the viewer feels some genuine empathy of what she's going through. It's a brave movie with good performances and some tight actor chemistry. What the movie does lack is humor. Taking itself far too seriously the pacing needs to release some tension for the next scene to be even more effective. The stakes are not going up in level and neither does the music give a sense of urgency. As such the viewer has a medium level of tension after the first 30 minutes which doesn't reach a peak.For me the biggest let down was the resolution as to why a series of events is happening. I will admit from a script you need to have just enough tension to make it plausible, yet mysterious enough not to make it ridiculous. It's a tough call, but one which has been done better elsewhere. I'm coming to that....The 'why' fails to satisfy the viewer. The 'Déjà-vu and mad person is hunting us' genre, (as given in the non spoiler description). I'd ask you to measure this movie against 'Time Crimes'. This movie gave beef to a strange series of events, a mysterious hunter plus a plausible resolution. The difference is the focus for the plot and I believe you need interaction from a 3rd party to give credence to the plot line.To conclude, the movie is well shot and did quite well for its budget: Think Kubrick's 'The Shining'. However like other movies of Déjà-vu, you're forced to wolf down a tired logical argument down your throat and you're choked into thinking 'that's clever'. I think the better movies of this genre have been less focused on action, killing and more on the mystery and trying to think around the problem. Unless it's a franchise I believe the viewer deserves some resolution. This is the crucial part of a protagonist who's ""not right in the head"" to be given credence and the plot a resolution. It worked in Donny Darko didn't it? :-D",Triangle

The direction is strong and acting as good too.It starts and engages you in the story pretty quick and plays with your mind.But, of course You have to play along and be a little concentrated which i didn't even realize i had to because the movie glued me to ""what happens next"" and that i feel should always be in mind whilst watching a suspense Thriller. Melissa George did a fantastic job and was the most seen character in the whole movie (literally) - You will get this after you watch the movie.

New Jess's shows up about every 10 mins and she doesn't die throughout the entire movie, so wouldn't the ship fill up with multiple Jess's ??? I get the concept, but its flawed, and when a movie is flawed, it just ruins it. Jess is obviously a forgetful one, since she doesn't remember anything that happens to her previously. Its just not a quite a great film when there's obvious flaws. Its OK if you like something to PLAY with your mind, but it just doesn't make sense. After the car reck, they find the dead body but she's still alive. OK, this is not a real movie just, plain fictional events. That doesn't make one smarter, just a fake movie to entice you for a moment, like a drug. Its not something that will stimulate you for a long time, just for the time being.

And I don't regret it for a moment! The movie starts out rather slow, but hold on for the first 15-20 minutes or so, and you're in for a real thrill! It's extremely well thought out in every detail, and really gives you the creeps at times. While it might not interest everyone, I myself have always had a huge interest for movies which deal with time travel/displacement/shift, whatever you may call it. Edge of Tomorrow is like that too, another movie I enjoyed a great deal. It kinda shows you how decisions may affect your further life, and how differently it may evolve because of those decisions. Once it starts rolling, you will get so hooked into it that you cannot wait to see how it ends.

Movie moves on and the boat hits a storm, leaving behind just four of them. There goes the best part, since they board on ship, the theory of alternate reality starts it's work.

I Mean It, If You Haven't Seen It and this happens to be the 1st review read..Leave now and Watch it. That out of the way, this is an undiscovered classic. The tension rises and falls like the sea waves on which the majority of time the action takes place on. Its a story of understanding our faults, our fears, our roles, fates & significance within the universe. It all becomes a bit creepy, a bit like a slasher movie, then BAM! the movie leapfrogs onto a whole new 'purpose'. Its like a What The F.... kind of moment. (The Boat on which The main star is enduring - is called the Aeolus. Mythology on Aeolus's son, Sisyphus depicts a personification of the waves rising to a height and then suddenly falling, or of the treacherous sea and the lessons teach of repeating something unobtainable perpetually as a punishment for some offence committed on earth.)

331,Pranavist,A surrealistic movie for unbiased audiences,10,10 April 2014,"Triangle is an surrealistic movie which was astonishingly directed by Christopher Smith. It has a neat cinematography, mediocre editing, nice background score, good sound-mixing etc. Since it has a splendid as well as complicated screenplay I'd like to concentrate more into it in this review. It's quite intriguing to cognize that Christopher Smith was inspired by the movie 'The Shining' by Stanly Kubrick. Apparently the gist of this movie can be viewed from different perspectives. It may take more than 2 times for substantiating the movie. I've seen it around 5 times in a row in order to comprehend each and every aspect of it. I'd like to give a brief summary of the movie that I've understood so far, followed by my interpretations subsequently.Jess looks after her son and consoles him since he had seen a bad dream. After packing her luggage to the car, she drives with her son as she was supposed to yacht with his friend Greg. On the way she meets Greg's friend Victor, and when they inquired about her son, she thinks for a while and replies he is at school. After introducing everyone they start yachting and end up in a catastrophe. They lose Heather(a friend of Sally) in that heavy storm and eventually they find a ferryboat and get in. Unfortunately they couldn't find anybody there. At the same time Jess is experiencing deja vu and she shares her bizarre feeling with Greg. Greg thinks she was on the hangover of the previous disaster at their yacht. And he consoles Jess that the feelings are the by product of her shock and it's delusional. Downey point towards a picture which was a black & white photograph of the ferryboat. And beneath the photograph a synopsis of Sisyphus(A God of Greek Mythology) is found. Ignoring the synopsis they wander around the ferryboat. Everyone except Jess was curious to meet someone. Each of her friends are being killed by a serial killer with a rumpled costume and a mask and Jess somehow survived as confronts that killer. The killer requests Jess to kill her friends. After a while she realizes that the incidents are being repeated as she finds her friends and herself in the yacht. The movie steps into a complex line and occasionally clones of Jess and her friends began to occur in disguise. As far as the original Jess(that we are following through out the movie) is concerned the only thing to get way is to break the loop. Hence she decided to kill the disguised copies of herself and her friends to break the loop. Manifestly Jess realizes that some of her ancestor clones had already begun to break the loop and she herself is being confronted by the them since she has put on the costumes of that ferryman with a mask. After getting away from the ship she arrives at a seashore in unconscious state. Affirming her consciousness Jess aims back and arrives home to encounter her latest clone. Since her son had seen the murder, she empowers him saying herself is the real mother and the other things are just delusions, which had already shown in the first few scenes. Finally they get killed by a mishap. She instructed her cab driver to get her into the harbor and she also assured him that she will come back. The movie ends when she meets Victor and Greg in the harbor just before the journey starts. Interpretation 1: Since the sole purpose of her excruciation and struggle was to rescue her child off the accident, it must be the starting point of this loop. Gradually she engages to made up complex stories deliberately with the assistance of the Story of Sisyphus of Greek Mythology, Toy Boat(for Tommy), the photograph of the ancient ferryboat, the quote at the side-way(something like ""please return back""), the seagull(that accidentally killed by Jess), the remarks of her driver(like ""there is no point to rescue the child, no matter how many times you do""), etc. And my means of such a complex story she convinces herself that she can do better up next time, Afterall she can rescue Tommy.Interpretation 2: Like the story of Sisyphus, the entire story may be a metaphor. She was guilty as she scolded Tommy. And she wants to get rid of the accident and to protect her son. After the accident her soul traps in there. Since she was allowed to take a chance to rescue her son by the cab driver. He was impersonated as death. Remember he warns her ""No matter how many times you try to rescue him, there is no hint to happen so"" And he assures whether she could come back. After dropping her in the harbor he informs her that the meter would be running forever! As if she is doomed to suffer in the loop. That is analogous to the story of Sisyphus who was condemned to roll a huge rock uphill for the punishment of deceiving the queen of devil.",Triangle

341,fahnenjoker,"Decent attempt at a Loop-Mystery, flawed by holes in its inner logic.",6,10 March 2019,"Triangle is an okay attempt of a time-/purgatory-loop mystery story. It shares a lot of similarities with Time Crimes, but ultimately goes more into the direction of Stay. Camera work and direction are quite good and the cast does an ok job. The effects can be bit cheap at times (the bad CGI of the storm and the approaching Ghost Ship), but that's neglectable.The whole time loop interaction is done well at first, but ultimately the whole story construct turns out to be inconsistent in the end. The movie can't decide what kind of inner logic it wants to follow.The most obvious interpretation is that the protagonist Jess has mistreated and killed her autistic Son (and herself?) by accident and is now trapped in a purgatory-loop for eternity (like Sisyphus from ancient Greek mythology, who is mentioned aboard the ghost ship that is named after his father Aeolus, and who is punished for cheating death by having to roll a stone up a hill only to watch it roll down over and over again). This is the interpretation I would deem most likely, but there are a number of contradictions to this in the movie.Two variations of that interpretation would be, that Jess is in a coma (after the car accident) and this is all a dream, or that she just died, but her soul can't accept that and is dreaming up this endless loop until she can make peace with the death of her son and herself and move on to afterlife.Another possibility would be, that she is actually in some kind of time-loop, caused by the Bermuda triangle (hence the movie title). The ghost ship Aeolus is a cruise ship from the 1930s. But this seems unlikely, and therefore the title may be disappointingly misleading for some viewers.A very funny interpretation I found in an online comment, that really made me laugh: The whole loop is a scheme of sea gulls who want to take revenge on Jess for killing one of them with the car and also want countless bodies to pile up on the Aeolon on which they can feed.^^Now let's get to the inconsistencies:At the end of this incarnation of Jess's loop that we follow through the movie, she has killed her abusive former self and later her son in a car accident. The taxi driver seems to be death/Charon, who offers her to pass over to an afterlife, but she (always) seems to decide to try the loop again, to save her son. But what happened before the very first loop? If the real/original abusive Jess killed herself and her son in that car accident, what sense does the whole boat trip make, since she never experienced that? If only her son died and she went on the trip, how then does she end up in purgatory (the Loop-Jesses on the ship never actually die or kill each other)?Why does Jess lose her memory when completing and resetting the overarching loop, and just keeps a vague déjà vu, while after the loop resets on the Aeolon she can remember everything?What continues to exist and what disappears with each reset of the loops is very inconsistent as well: the 100s of notes, necklaces, bodies of her killed friends and bodies of the sea gulls before the car accident keep piling up. At the same time though, there seem to be only 3-4 parallel Jesses at work on the Aeolon and only one Jess around her house. Shouldn't there be exactly the same number of Jesses as there are bodies and objects? It would make more sense if the objects would reset with each loop.The Aeolon: The first reset of the sub-loop aboard the ship starts with a hanging gramophone record, that seems synched with the looping/stuttering happenings aboard the ship at that moment. Also the clock of Jess is synced with that of the dining hall, but different from that of her friend Greg. In the first loops the food in the dining hall is fresh, later its suddenly rotten. How does this all add up?The behavior of Jess: Why is Jess hiding all the time instead of talking to her friends or the other Jesses? Where does the notion that killing everybody will reset the timeline originally come from? Why does she just accept that and goes on a killing spree?At one time she actually tries to change something and stops the hooded Jess from shooting the couple. That alternate hooded Jess now takes the couple to Room 237 (nice Shining reference btw. and it's also the address of Jess's house) and stabs the guy. His wife escapes only to end up dying on a pile of bodies of former iterations of herself. The problem here: The Jess we follow, never becomes that alternate hooded Jess that she stops, so where does that Jess come from and what happens to her? She also stops the first Jess from killing the guy with the headwound. What happened to him in this alternate loop?As you can see, this movie really gets you thinking. It's still mostly enjoyable to watch and I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves these kinds of stories. But it isn't as clever as it believes itself to be and can't decide on a consistent inner logic.",Triangle

343,craighepworth,"Brilliant, a genre piece that delivers more",10,2 March 2010,"Anyone on here who describes this in anyway negative is not a film fan. Triangle is a fantastic original thriller that allows an audience to fill in the blanks instead of pushing every detail down their throats. The UK critics raved about the movie when it came out, however the audiences were not huge, I feel however that this will be a cult classic and it deserves to be. I won't go in to detail about the story as it's hard to without giving anything away but ultimately this is story about redemption, doing anything to find a second chance, the twists keep coming but the film allows you to decide what you think happened, was it all in her head, was she dead etc etc. Visually it's stunning, its art house cinematography meets mainstream as the movie is itself. The directing is on the ball and the choices made right down to the minute details (didn't they just go left, why are they on the right?), it's clever without being self indulgent and thrilling without being predictable. Mellissa George gives a tour de force performance and I was thrilled that the critics recognised her, to handle the 3 versions of herself the way she did and to keep the audience on her side with a very blank starting performance is the signs of a great actress, this is by far the best and most interesting performance she has given. Some people have spoke of plot holes but I didn't see any, I think it's hard to call plot holes on this film when the writer intentionally chooses not to give you all the answers, for me the film played beautifully. Triangle is the kind of film that should be praised. It's not more teen thriller rubbish with a basic stalk and slash premise, it's a clever, thought provoking and almost morality piece that we just don't see in this genre very much. From what I can tell the movie has not had an American release, this film needs to find a US distributer now as it's far better than the wide release commercial movies of this genre that plague the box office. People who found this movie boring, pretentious or confusing must be the people who sit through movies like Hostel and Prom Night and find them thrilling.

Once said myth is considered, I think it provides a pretty shocking and well-earned twist toward the end that really ups the intellectual significance of an otherwise good but not great film.People can dislike the film in spite of this, obviously, but I encourage everyone to rewatch if it seemed too bland. Triangle contains good acting, an appropriately complex plot and a much deeper meaning than many give it credit for. I'd recommend this one to anyone.",Triangle

Triangle is one of such films, my friends have never even heard of it, even the ones I went to see it on the big screen alongside have forgotten its existence. Shame, because it's a quality movie, 2009 saw a hornets nest of Horror movies, more fashionable and in then in 2015. Triangle stood out as the best of the bunch.I'll refrain from giving away too much about the plot, as it's the whole reason for watching, but those that have seen it will know how clever it is, well structured, intelligent and deep.Melissa George is great in the lead, she is so hot, I think she makes it the great film that it is. The film messes with your mind, and leaves you guessing and wondering right the way through.A horror? of sorts, more a psychological thriller that dares to mess with it's viewers. >>>>>Watch it>>>>>",Triangle

355,kennethsutton,"Interesting, But Not Well Done",6,14 May 2017,"First, I would like to note that those who rate this movie with a 1/10, have zero credibility. They may make valid points about flaws in the movie, but it undoubtedly deserves more than a 1. The good thing about the movie is that is provides a lot of suspense, and keeps you entertained for the first half of the movie. There is a good atmosphere and a sense of concern for those in the movie, and what they will find on this ""ghost-like"" ship. This made the first 1/2 to 2/3 of the movie pretty good, and it kept me watching. The bad thing is that after 50-70% through the movie, there is a lot of repetition. In addition, the protagonist repeatedly makes dumb decisions that fuels repetitions, instead of changing the course of the story/events. I can give a lot of example, and I don't think it will completely spoil the story.1) The protagonist had many opportunities to stop her counterparts from boarding the ship, but kept hiding.2) When Greg answered the emergency radio call, there was an opportunity to give a warning, but no warning was given. 3) There was an opportunity to prevent Victor from being injured again on the deck, but the protagonist didn't intervene. And this continued on and on, with example after example. Again, and again, the protagonist didn't take initiative that would have made the story was interesting, and engaging, and more fulfilling. In other words, the protagonist was ineffective at changing the course of events, which is pretty tragic...because that is what the audience craved. I give the movie a 6, because it was not boring. It was actually entertaining. It simply didn't close the deal. It had a lot of ""unnecessary"" repetition. And the ending was pretty disappointing, and was more of the same repetition and ""inability to change events"", that was over-reflected in earlier parts of the movie.",Triangle

358,johncloke,Ambitious change of direction for Smith - excellently done,8,5 September 2009,"I too saw this at FrightFest and purposefully avoided reading too much about it beforehand. Having loved Creep and enjoying the silliness of Severance, I was expecting something squarely within the horror genre. This is definitely not that. Quite surprised it was chosen to open the festival actually - but this is by no means a criticism.The film isn't quite a thriller either - the unconventional narrative reminded me more of Memento. There's another film, a well known US comedy (which I won't name to save the spoiler) which employs a similar device - although this film is by no means unoriginal. The film, like Memento, is satisfyingly complex in leaving the viewer with questions about precisely what has gone on but without any feeling of bafflement.A great central performance from Melissa George really makes the film - she really pulls off the huge character development required over the duration of the film - no mean feat given the structure and short running time of the film.This should open up some doors for Smith outside the horror genre - and on this evidence he is going to be well capable of dealing with complex and big ideas and I'm looking forward to more interesting work from him ASAP.",Triangle

365,jcwebb,"Pretty good, but lets not get carried away",6,30 November 2015,"Its a pretty good movie. The acting is alright, likewise the special effects, even the dialogue. However, it does contain some HUGE plot holes that spoil the overall feeling for the film - as discussed in length by others here.What really spoiled it for me was the stereotypical north American white middle-class silly reactions to events. The main character notices some weird sh*t going on, so her first reaction is ""oh i must have gone mad"". This used to be a cheap and lazy way for B movies to get the blond girl alone (without her shirt) with the villain of the movie. Nowadays its standard, and its annoying. OK, i don't live in North America, but my friends do - and they certainly don't cry in the bathroom about loosing their minds because they saw someone run by wearing a ghost mask or horses head...Next annoyance - the main character gets past herself and deals with the situation. Solution: kill everyone! I mean WTF? How does any normal person suddenly come up with the idea that the best way out is to kill everyone? How about confronting other people with words! In this movie just showing up would put a spanner in the works. God forbid you ask for help, maybe a bit of teamwork...So while the movie was indeed a bit of fun, it was predicable and worth watching (when the other channels are full of repeats).",Triangle

Well all said and and done the plot is a remake of ""Timecrimes"". Watch it and you will know what a true thriller it is. Particularly speaking the lack of reason why things go the way in the movie is a big setback. The characters are unrefined. The lead actress seems to have come out of an oven. Poor cinematography and where does the ship come from? Watch out the original. Not worth wasting your time here. The plot comes to being from a ship, then to the house and again back and forth.

367,tele-cine,May cause dizziness.,6,24 January 2010,"Somewhat confusing. I didn't hate it, but this plot concept has been implemented more successfully before, I think. This film spins dizzily until you get that vague feeling like when you've forgotten why you walked purposefully into another room in your house. You stand there befuddled for a moment, then you do your best to muddle through the ambiguity without context.The recursive nature of Triangle's plot emerges almost immediately, but is not used as skillfully as in the movie Identity (2003), in my opinion. I kept waiting for some original defining twist that never appeared. There are no intermittent flashes of thread interconnection to serve as clues. So, you keep watching for the big surprise that doesn't pop. I'm sure this plot device is not original to Identity, either. Both films resemble Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958), a little, but in Triangle you barely have any inkling, beyond motion-sickness, that the plot is even moving forward.There is much to confuse the viewer in this film. The intentional circular logic does not congeal, even to the very end, failing to confirm the complete sequence of events. Is the main character dead? Is she in a coma? Is she in a mental state of dissociative fugue? We never really know for sure. I really don't understand why the ""just a driver"" character is introduced so late. Perhaps a half-hearted attempt at plot resolution? However, as soon as you start feeling the relief of it finally being over, you just find yourself back at the beginning of the endless loop, again. Since the film viewer always sees through the main character's eyes there is no disinterested observer to imply objectivity. You can't even be sure if you're watching an instance of the unending-ending trope. This film was interesting in a few places, but not organized or clever enough to avoid looking like fragments of other stories.",Triangle

And you might need to watch this very movie for the second time to make sense if not! so would that not be worth some thing. Of Course it contains a geometrical Error and some flaws (hole) in the story like ""Critic Claims"" but very rarely visible if you go on to make sense but very Entertaining!!! And after all every other movies made also contains similar faults, which should not let you doubt a thing about this Gripping ""MOVIE"" believe me you will thank me if i helped you,make you watch this movie,like i did from this very review column.RE-EDITED (Made some changes cause recently i found out this is not original in story there is this Spain movie called ""Los cronocrímenes"" or in English title aka Timecrimes year 2007 so its obvious it is similar with this movie triangle but more detailed and precise no flaws or script hole i recommend both this movie for this similar genre) Only thing is that production of ""triangle"" was fabulous with some flaws but still good but In ""Timecrime"" the story was near perfection with not much fancy environment.....watch all recommended.. ""CONTAIN SPOILER"" From Here Person's from this review column did ask to clarify the loops holes and mistake's made in the movie ,here's my sincere opinion. First it all Depends on how you have applied the logic and How you have taken things in to account. The main character (jess) a single mother who's love for her son (tommy)makes every thing works, as is the main reason for this movie to take place. (jess) go on a suppose to be fun trip sailing in the open ocean, with their friends. But an unknown sudden catastrophic storm capsized their yacht like boat and killing one of their friend(Heather)remaining takes a shelter on a ocean Liner Ship which appears out of nowhere, which seems abandon , thinking it as a prank by the crew's of that ship. AND its here were every thing unfolds the Horror . NOW the mistakes and faults as people said i thinks this the best way to filled this faults Using a little bit of my own Script ( this movie is also based on time line were people have to deal with multiple dimension in which all dimensional works, collide in one place and ""Jess"" is the only one who becomes aware of it and yet continues to take on the loop through time again and again to save her son ...CONTINUED(1)(Look Continued(2)BELOW ,One or two multiple character of jess seems unexplained by the movie ""Jess"" multiple character turning evil(not really)to meet and unite with her son left alone at home with no care who's also retarded, every certain period of time the accident occurs again and again multiplying all the characters of jess boarding the ship and their friends as well. Only jess becomes aware of this ,NOW........... after she tries to save her friend multiple times leading to killing their friend instead . continue...later after she is washed ashore from the ship back to her place she runs to her sons home horrified to see another version of her she kills her put her in the back of her cars trunk and with her son she leaves home on the same car, only a freak accident kills her sons so in order to save her son..CONTINUED(2) she decides to go back on the harbor to resume her loop time line journey knowing that every action she has done is part of the loop so preparing her self again for sailing she gets on a taxi to the harbor while on her sleep in the cab she lost her memory DUE TO ACCIDENT say temporary loss of memory or Amnesia or THE CURSE for cheating Death like mention in the movie and thus she resumes her journey again and again forgetting every time she tries to change them.",Triangle
370,nicky_hansard,Interesting movie but...,6,2 November 2010,"This is a very interesting and surreal movie. Yet am I the only one who is sick of movies such as these where the director is under the impression that a complex and complicated movie does not have to make sense (hey you may be able to confuse us with these kinds of story lines, doesn't mean you can have gaping plot holes). I know how this sounds but think about, in what way could killing the other stranded people help her? Or being noble and killing a child abuser, even though it was her doing the abusing and she would understand why she was acting like that (what did she think she would accomplish killing herself, it makes no sense, she could have taken herself to a scientific institute and made millions for herself and her son). I am sorry but so many things just don't add up in this movie, just because it makes you go 'wow, deep story line' does not make it a good movie.That is not to say I did not enjoy this movie but why would you go through all that, just to let a taxi driver (obviously had something to do with what happened aka responsible for your kids death) take you back to the beginning of the entire situation? She was happy to kill her friends, yet didn't even confront the taxi driver? Basically what I am getting at is... I wish all the new abstract thinkers who believe movies like these are 'good' because they are so smart and the average person doesn't get it would stop and kick themselves in the face and get a life (just like the art critics who think paint thrown a canvas is something to be admired). I bet the critics would give this great marks because it is so abstract and would be so carried away that they either don't notice or ignore the things that don't make sense in this movie. Hey say what you will about people like me but you must have noticed at least some holes in this movie.",Triangle
371,asefkabir,Logical Explanation of the Movie Triangle,10,15 July 2010,"Although the plot of triangle doesn't suggest much about what's actually happening, there are some very significant but subtle clues that point towards a valid explanation. Based on that, I have come up with a logical explanation. I think the whole cyclical ""time loop"" phenomenon of Jess is nothing but a horrid nightmare or perplexed fantasy of a psychologically disturbed or schizophrenic person, who's none but Jess herself. The whole story is a prolonged illusion of Jess's disturbed mind, influenced by her subconscious. I think my theory must be supported by valid logic and that's what I will illustrate now. First of all, the thought-flow of psychologically deranged people often tends to get stuck at a point and takes a cyclical or repetitive route. That's the reason why often they repeat the same words ""over and over again"" and fantasize the same events over and over (like the music of a broken tape as depicted by a scene in the movie). Like normal people their thought process and imagination do not take a flexible ""straightforward path"". Moreover, we borrow many elements from our reality to build up our dreams and fantasies. Jess did that too. These elements of Jess's reality are the clues to suggest that it was a dream of her disturbed world. Many of these clues are actually hidden in the first scenes of the movie. Remember the capsized toy yacht of Tommy that Jess picks up from the water bowl in the first scene. Look at it carefully. It absolutely resembles the ""Triangle"" yacht. At the very moment, the wild chirping of the flying seagulls in the sky and Jess's sharp reaction to that is also significant. Later on the Yacht in the sea looks like a toy boat. When Jess wipes Tommy's paint from the floor her skirt gets stained by it and the paint resembles blood (carefully see the scene when Jess cleans up the blue paint from her floor). Perhaps, it symbolizes a distressed life that she has. Most importantly, Jess's house number is 237 (see one of the opening scenes when someone rings her doorbell and she comes out) and the number of the cabin, in which Jess and Greg enter in the ship Aeolus and find the ""GO TO THEATER"" written on the mirror, is also 237. This cannot be a coincident. This clue is ingeniously given by the director and this significant clue clearly demonstrates the fact that this entire cycle is a fantasy of Jess's mind and she has ""subconsciously"" picked up elements from her reality (like her house number) in order to construct this paranormal world of unspeakable horror. During the story Jess takes three different roles, i.e. Killer Jess, Savior Jess, and Innocent Jess. At one point of time, there are three different copies or ""personalities"" of Jess present in Aeolus. Killer Jess (masked one) kills everyone but herself in Aeolus, which's nothing but a macabre fantasy of a disturbed mind. Here the same Jess plays three different roles. This triangular personality concept of Jess is another fantasy of her disturbed mind characterized by strong influence of ""Multiple Personality Disorder"" that often schizophrenic and psychotic people suffer from. Moreover, many things happen in the movie which's not possible in the real world. The time loop or cycle itself is fantastical and Jess doesn't die even after the violent car crash or after she falls off the Ship (because it's happening in her mind and her mind doesn't want to kill her in order to sustain the repetition of the cycle) And also the deserted ocean liner that appears out of no where is not realistic. Anybody would understand that this story is not possible in the real world. It's a cyclical illusion of a mentally disturbed world. Almost the entire plot and scenes of the movie revolve around Jess as it's a fantasy of her mind. Perhaps, our subconscious often picks up things from our reality that we are not aware of. It's possible that she had heard of a story of such a ship and the Greek Mythology in her life as she lives in a port city. Actually, what I think of the background of the story is that, Jess a single mother with an autistic boy lives a miserable life and her reality gradually makes her abusive and mentally disturbed. She wants to ""escape"" from her confining reality and her disturbed mind makes this repetitive fantasy, perhaps when she's asleep. A mood of sleep, dream and fantasy is resonated by Christian Henson's hypnotizing lullaby which's the theme music of the movie. Jess's psychic turmoil and self destructiveness is also reflected in her fantasy world, as she often stands in front of the mirrors and curiously sees herself (sometimes with sheer hatred in her eyes that demonstrates her hate for her own troubled existence of reality). The movie is so ingenious that you need a detective's eyes equipped with psychiatric knowledge to unveil all the clues. My explanations are based on my personal analysis and observations and I invite everyone to argue for or against it.",Triangle

376,iammrigank,Potential gone waste.. Rather disappointing..,6,27 July 2011,"I saw the movie upon recommendation of a friend of mine, who was greatly perplexed with such an experience, to say the least. He had so many questions and wished to discuss it after I had given it a shot. So i watched it. And i felt sad, not because the story did not appeal to me.. but coz' it was capable of becoming a great movie but ended up being a mess.I know a movie is on a reel, its not real. But I believe a good movie never looses focus from reality. However strange the theme is or however unbelievably amazing the plot is, it always circles around real people, and hence i expect real responses.The protagonist here is shown to be trapped in an apparently endless time-loop (not to mention the weird storm hitting them from nowhere). The first time they go on the ship, they are attacked and killed by a masked person in an otherwise desolate ship. All except Melissa George. Queer, but fine.Its the time the next group arrives that spoils it for me. Melissa, never approaches the group, keeping them totally unaware of anything ""our"" Melissa has experienced. Its most practical that she should have confronted them and shared her side of the story (Sorry, for ""practical"" doesn't sound right for such a plot, but i essentially meant common sense). This makes the whole movie frustrating to watch and seems like her actions have just been plotted that way to justify the happenings around.Then at the end Melissa is shown to go to the harbour back to where it all began, there by completing a whole loop with the viewers, from beginning to end. But that means the initial character knew this all was going to happen from the start. This is a huge hole in the story, for it renders all of her later actions meaningless because she was already aware of every incident to occur. Knots like this have made Triangle a greatly disappointing watch..But I meant it when I said that it had potential to be great. For instance, when the protagonist realizes that ""they"" suggesting the ""group-still-alive"" in the sea, return when all (previous) were dead, she decides to go on a killing spree so that when ""they"" come, she will ask them not to get on board... Ridiculous. The story could have taken a whole new turn only if she instead decide to save their asses so that ""they"" don't return(because no one on board gets killed). Thus giving the story a more plausible direction and her actions meaning. All in all, my experience with the movie was bad. But still i would recommend 1 watch for the effort and courage put in by Smith to have thought of something so unusual like this.Regards.",Triangle

Not only does the plot have more holes than your mama's drawers, the non-climactic ending actually made me feel depressed and angry. The acting isn't bad at all and the movie is really put together well. However the ending is just so illogical and non-intriguing that it leaves you questioning whether it was really worth your while to view this film. If it were not for the acting, cinematography, and beautiful main actress, I would have given this film a 2/10 (I gave it a 5). In conclusion, I advise you not to watch this film! The ending is terrible!",Triangle
381,brenjamesuk,This makes me want drugs - now!!!,8,1 July 2012,"What just happened?! Not sure what to make of this film - but I think I liked it. In time, when I've had time to digest it - I think I might like it a lot. THIS MAKES ME WANT DRUGS - NOW!!!This film is like a cross between Howard's Way and The Twilight Zone! (It's not really anything like Howard's Way).This is very much probably a ""Marmite"" film (sorry to use that now overused pseudo-term, but I don't think it's ever been so apt). At the time of writing, the LoveFilm tally is that 232 people ""Loved it,"" and 154 ""Hated it."" So I think I'm justified in saying this.Not a lot to say about the film itself without spoiling, except that the Melissa George character (looking damn good in shorts and vest all the way through), turns up looking fairly sketchy to join a sailing trip with her friend, and his friends. All starts off fairly standard, as they set off for sun, sea and frolics - but why was she looking so sketchy? All will be explained - OR NOT!!Needless to say it soon gets pretty damn weird! I liked it. Many others will, many won't. I seem to be stumbling across a number of these films lately - the kind of thing that will get you existentially musing on the nature of existence. If you're not into that kind of thing and ONLY want, filmic horror/thriller, then move on.

383,jrd1093,"Pseudo-intellectual, Brain-Dead Entertainment",3,15 March 2020,"To say the least, I'm flabbergasted by the amount of favorable reviews of this movie. One reviewer called it ""the greatest movie of all time,"" and others claim it's ""intelligent,"" ""complex,"" and ""in the style of David Lynch"" -- a severe insult to Lynch, if you ask me. In reality, this movie is a painstakingly amateur attempt at making an intelligent psychological thriller. I guessed the plot within the first 15 minutes, after the distress call that *obviously* came from one of the women aboard the Triangle. If that wasn't enough to let you know that the movie is about timewarps/interdimensions, the ghost-ship's name, Aeolus, and the laughably heavy-handed explanation of the name's significance should tell everyone with a brain everything they need to know. Using the myth of Sisyphus for a horror movie about time loops is a good idea on the surface (although it's already been done SO many times), but what really makes Triangle's use of it so awful is that the writer makes it blatantly obvious that they're using it. The characters literally explain the myth twice in the film (y'know, because time loop). To the reviewers who call this an ""intelligent"" and ""complex"" movie: if the movie has to *explain its supposed complexities to you*, it is not intelligent, and neither are you! This also applies to the seagulls. Anyone who's read ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" will recognize it right away (as I did) because that poem is referenced into the dirt by movies about the ocean. It may be a shockingly ""intelligent"" reference for ignorant viewers, but for people who know what they're talking about it's all just a big cliche.If I had to summarize this movie, based on the film itself and the audience reaction to it, judging from these reviews, I would say this: It's a stupid person's idea of a smart person's movie. Its inspirations are horrendously obvious, and its technical aspects aren't any better (see the ax fight between Old Jess and New Jess to get a prime example of awful editing). This is NOT a Lynchian film in the slightest. It's an abysmal direct-to-DVD release resembling something you'd see an undergraduate film major try to write.",Triangle

It started to dawn on me that it was going to be just another pointless and pretentious piece of drivel that seems to be getting churned out these days by so called talented directors. the entire theme of the film was a ridiculously repetitive cycle of rubbish that was not in the least bit new or original. It was like an old TV movie from the 70s The acting was also poor and very amateurish. I watched all the way hoping that there was going to be a twist in the story but no--it was annoyingly predictable start to finish and a waste of my time and money do not bother to watch as it has nothing to offer and will just leave you exasperated that it had a boring seen it all before ending with no real climax or sense to it really-----cant understand the good reviews some people gave it!,Triangle

It holds its premise till the end and doesn't fall apart at the conclusion as many others do. Has definitely numerous plot holes which I would simply forgive for all the brilliance the atmosphere it creates.Edit: I newly watched a Spanish movie called ""Timecrimes"" which had a lot with this one in common. Timecrimes however was made in 2007 so this one is almost a remake of Timecrimes. SPOILERThe only difference was that Timecrimes was simpler and linear with basically everything explained. Triangle plot however occurs within a loop with lesser or no explanation provided which was more thrilling and elevated the experience of the 2nd viewing.

Overall this movie flew under the radar for me and I accidentally stumbled over it and now highly recommend it. The trailer makes it seem like it will be a highjacker suspense movie or even a slasher type with a killer running loose on the boat which to an extent is kind of is.The buildup throught this movie is great because things keep happening and you just want to know who's doing the killing. The acting is probably as good as it gets for this kind of genre. Not to take anything away from the actors but horror thrillers like this usually draw low expectations for acting and this movie exceeded that.The movie moves smoothly throughout while keeping your attention with moments the entire time and then eventually throws a curveball at you that blows your mind if you dont expect it. The time loop concept is a fun idea for movies and constantly ties previous events together that make you go ""oooohhh ok, that makes sense now"".All in all this is a good one and definitely worth watching.",Triangle

391,ryguy1718,You will be haunted by this movie,10,26 March 2010,"To be perfectly honest, when I came across this movie on Netflix watch instantly.... I had very very low hopes for it. I was fully expecting a low budget Saturday night SyFy flick.After watching the 1st 10 mins, I was hooked. This was no ""Ghost Ship"" rip off or another mindless Bermuda Triangle flick.From the moment the Melissa George steps on to the ""Triangle"" it is a never ending thrill ride (sorry bad pun). For a movie that was made on (seemingly) no budget.... it looks amazing. Colors, light and textures are used to suck you into the story and even tell the story. There is not too much CGI, but what there is.. looks believable.. The doomed cruise liner ""Aeolus"" is nice eye candy as well (side note, can filmmakers stop using the Queen Mary as the default ""look"" for liners?) As far as acting goes... This Movie is really a ""One Women show"" for Melissa. Most of the time I can't stand when a Movie sticks with one person. But she pulls it off with skill, by the time the (2,x,3x?) twist ending rolls around, you will feel bad for her and wish you could help her.Story, oh my.. I could write a review just about this.To make it simple, it starts out as a ""Triangle\Ghost Ship"" spec film... but it quickly diverges into something very different. The director leads you down one story path, only to pull the rug out from under you at the last moment. This a is a movie you watch 1,2 or even 3 times before you get it all together. Trust me though, it is worth every second of second guessing yourself.I predict Triangle to become one of the future thriller classics.My only complaint... why no backstory on the ship!!!

394,hellhigh,full of holes? that's quite unfair.,7,11 June 2012,"Watched it twice, very nicely constructed story. Buried in details, a Mobius strip, a perpetual limbo. It's kind of a Lynchian film but much less fertile in deep layers, more straightforward and action-driven. Just like Mulholland Drive, this is also a story about the torturing (un)consciousness of guilt, a journey in eternal frustration towards the unreachable redemption. It took me a second viewing to totally figure out the whole schema of the story, and I can't remember the last time I got to spend this much thoughts on the plot structure of a movie. Reading some negative reviews makes me kind of sad. I think that we should give the writer/director some credit here. He really did thoroughly plan it out, no major plot hole or incoherent character behavior. Actually, having a twist NOT simply for the sake of having a twist, but did have some logical explanation behind it, how rare is that for a horror/mystery movie these days?I know it's a stupid urge but can't help it, so SPOILERS:Simply put, there's one loop, two version of Jess (endless copies but only two version of her), and three copies of her on board the ship at the same time.The Jess we follow throughout the film is an odd-number-version, the next jess boarding the ship is an even-number-version. By pointing a gun at the next coming Jess, she actually creates a different version of herself.Keep in mind that a Mobius strip means that there's no beginning or end. Wherever we are, we're stuck in the middle. So when we follow our Jess to the ship, the event has already started. It's not the first Jess boarding the ship, actually, when she gets on the ship, there are already two copies of herself on board.Each time an odd version copy kills another odd version copy, an even version kills another even version.Let's say our Jess is copy number 5, when she boards the ship, there are at same time copy 3 4 5, two odd version, one even version. 5 kills 3, a new even version coming, the situation becomes 4 5 6. The 5, our Jess, goes to point a gun at 6 and makes her run away. 6 kills 4 on the deck. Then we get 5 6 7. Like the 3, our Jess gets killed by 7, a new odd version of herself. Then 6 7 8, 7 8 9... Endlessly.As for the taxi driver, he asks Jess, you'll come back won't you? Jess promises she will, just as dead Sisyphus promised to return to the underworld. When she doesn't return, when she falls asleep on the yacht, the perpetual sisyphean punishment begins.",Triangle

396,bobby_mak,One of the best mysteries lately,9,25 November 2009,"This movie is really amazing. I recommend it a 100%. It plays with your mind from the very beginning until the very end. It just makes you think all the time and even when the credits roll you are left thinking and considering, and I mean that in the good way. Some movies leave you thinking ""Why did that happen? It made no sense whatsoever."". Not this. However, in order to understand everything you must really pay attention to all the details, some lines, some specific shots and then I promise, it will all make sense. Of course, if you have someone to discuss it with after it is over, will make things a lot more interesting and engaging. I just want to say that this movie is not a horror and doesn't have any ""jump"" moments. It is a pure mystery and I am sure that any mystery fan would truly enjoy the experience.I am not going to give away anything concerning the plot, because this will just spoil the pleasure from all the twists and turns this movie takes you through. This is my advice: Do not read anything about this movie or watch any trailers, before you actually see it. Believe me, it is going to be a lot more fun like this. The story is extremely engaging and the end is very satisfying. New elements are constantly added when you least expect them and the movie actually answers all the questions it asks, or at least provides you with enough clues to solve the puzzles yourself.Melissa George gives probably her best performance up to date. She really helps a lot in making the movie what it is. She has a great potential in her as an actress and I hope this opens even more doors for her.All I can say is, see this movie!

If it's true that the writer took two years to finish the script then he should seriously consider giving up his career. There is no rational explanation to why a person who knows what's going to happen to her, will do the same thing all over.

This piece has it! What I mean is there is very little, if any, wasted lines or wasted moments in this film. Virtually every word and every detail serves the overhaul thrust of the story.And oh what a story. By the way, if you like the show Lost, you'll probably love the complexities of The Triangle. As long as you also like violence. Lots of violence.I think a few other commenters have mentioned what I was going to say next so I'll skip my general points and get to my main criticism: the most important decision in the entire film, which is the main character, the one we seem to start off with in the movie (before we abandon her for her inter dimensional clones) at some point has to decide to become part of the pattern of violence. She has to decide that she will start killing friends.That's a big decision.And that decision, that moment, that shift, is rather poorly played out in this film. If they would have just spent maybe one extra screen minute or had maybe two more lines making us believe that she (that we) would do the same thing in the same circumstances, this film would be close to amazing. But it never shows us that crucial process. She just falls in line. And that quick step renders the piece as a whole a rather bland array of violence.There are great moments, though! no question. You will be entertained. But your intellect will be a bit unquenched.6 stars. Well earned.AStJ",Triangle
405,tmoreau2,Excellent psychological thriller,10,27 November 2010,"Its incredible that so many reviewers miss the point of this movie. Its spelled out for you, right in your face, at the end in typical American movie mass pandering. Most should be able to figure it out before then.Let me explain, with _extreme_spoilers_ which completely ruin the movie....Woman boards yacht, naps, and wakes up from a nightmare that she cant quite remember. Bad things start to happen.We follow the woman through the movie and learn things with her as the story is revealed in a series of layers. The yacht trip is repeating indefinitely, and with some overlap, so that there are clones of the main character. We learn there are two of her on alternating cycles, one good and one evil. The woman we are following through the movie is the good one, and we learn that this is by far not the first time she has lived this cycle. We learn of the alternate selfs death and wait with baited breath to learn about this selfs demise and thus how the cycle is reset. She is fighting to break the cycle before this revelation, before its too late.As the end of the movie approaches, she tries to rescue her son from her evil half, but crashes her car killing them both. This ultimately reveals that the two selves were one, a schizophrenic multiple personality disorder that she developed to deny her evil doings to herself. We realize that we were duped into the delusions, the one who washed ashore was the evil one we though met her demise being thrown overboard. After the car crash she is immediately reincarnated, takes a taxi, re boards the yacht, passes out from exhaustion, and the cycle starts again with just the fleeting memory of a bad dream.This ending revealed only the presence of the next layer, leaving the real story up to your imagination. Was the entire yacht trip a calculated murder spree executed by her ghost after being freed from her denial and from the need to care for her son, the need to be good? This freedom, this release, condemning her to hell? Actually, the entire movie starts and ends in five minutes of real time between the boys breakfast and the car crash. She was condemned to hell for past actions, only hinted at by the way she abused her son, and the entire yacht trip is a construct of the after world to mess with her mind for eternity.How does that change the other reviewers alleged plot holes? I found none in this exciting psychological thriller, and the more I think about the movie the more I like it.

If you want to watch it go ahead it's mildly entertaining but don't expect anything mind-blowing, this movie is very quickly and easily forgettable.

410,murphyrichardsx,A hauntingly good metaphysical horror,9,27 May 2014,"Do you like being forced to question the nature of reality? If so, I think you will enjoy watching this film.And I do really mean ""forced to question"". This is not the sort of film where the metaphysical element is a self-contained plot device like in, say, The Matrix where a specific question of the nature of reality is answered.With this film the metaphysical question of what is actually happening is the purpose of the plot. Although the clues are quite obvious as to what is occurring by the end, it is by no means unambiguous.It's not quite as convoluted and layered as, say, a David Lynch film. You can follow the journey of the central character, Jess, easily in a linear fashion. You get the emotional impact without having to analyse the film in any depth.In the respect of torturing Jess emotionally, the film relentlessly increases the sense of foreboding throughout the film until the very end. Even then, I think there is a lingering fear of the unknown.I've seen a few people comparing this film to Los Cronocrímenes, but aside from a visual similarity and a looping narrative, Triangle is very different. In Los Cronocrímenes the metaphysical question is answered (it is definitely a time machine, I don't think that's even a spoiler) and the plot is very neat in explaining everything.On the other hand, Triangle intentionally gives no comprehensive answer and there are obvious loose ends. Personally, I like that.Whilst it's not going to appeal to everyone, I think this a haunting film which bears subsequent viewings.",Triangle
411,palaesTiNA,great acting & some really intelligent plot twists,8,1 June 2015,"If you like mystery or sci-fi dramas you shouldn't miss this one! Okay, after the first minutes of the film you probably expect another stereotype teenage horror movie like 'scream' or 'faculty' or something- only with less known actors based on an apparent much lower budget. But you couldn't be more any wronger. And it won't take a long time until you realize that. Triangle is much more profound & cleverer constructed. And you have to learn that unknown actors are talented from time to time, talented like the main actress of Triangle really is. The way she interpretes her complex role (and THAT role really has multiple layers) is fascinating and deserves appreciation. Without such excellent acting it would have been hard to draw the viewer so deep into that plot twist that it leaves you dizzy at the end. No matter how often you think you connected the storyline - plot holes turn out to be more and another scene reveals a another mystery. Be prepared for a captivating story, also the location 'ghost ship' sounds flat and empty and even worse a 'ghost ship' full of screaming & bleeding teenagers... don't let yourslf be fooled by this stereotype imagination. Here lies more under the surface....",Triangle

The plot is very engrossing and very well-paced, setting up questions throughout the film, but successfully keeping the viewer in the dark until it chooses enlighten them. It does not fall into the trap so many films do of giving the game away by clumsy foreshadowing.Melissa Graham's character is so essential to the film that it simply wouldn't work without Graham giving the strong performance that she does. The rest of the small cast also provide good support.This is a very good film that manages to stick out from the crowd with good ideas and competent execution.",Triangle
414,johnnycool-57067,A suitable case for treatment,1,12 May 2017,"I'm rather impressed by the number of reviewers who actually watched this movie to the end. Stronger than me, by a long shot. To be fair, I thought the first 15-20 minutes were sort of OK, until the yacht sank and what seemed like the ""ghost ship"" appeared. It basically went all down hill from there for me. It seemed pretty obvious that nobody was on-board, and the attempts of the ""survivors"" to reach the bridge took forever (if they even did). Fortunately, (or maybe not), I bailed out before the end, and don't think I missed anything of any consequence.At first, I thought that the ""character"" of Jess, (Melissa George), was mentally mixed-up somehow and that perhaps everything that happened later was some kind of psychotic episode. In other words, nothing was meant to be real at all in the film – the whole thing was an unraveling of her mental state. Maybe I'm trying to give extra credit to whoever put this mess together.Ms George doesn't seem capable of acting, at least not in this performance. She seemed to hold more or less one facial expression throughout. I guess that's something.I don't feel qualified to give this movie a rating, because I haven't seen it all, yet. I might fast-forward through it a bit and cheat, after I've had a couple of whiskies. So far, I'll give it a minus nine because I'm not drunk enough.",Triangle
415,murkenexpress,What an underrated flick!,10,21 October 2016,"I always enjoy watching good movies outside or I should say in addition to all of the big blockbusters when I get a chance, and what a great find of a movie in Triangle. The movie is essentially about a group of friends that go on a yachting trip and get caught up in an unusual storm. After it subsides, the friends think they have found sanctuary when they spot another ship, but upon boarding it, the group realizes something disturbing has and is happening on this ship.If you have seen the trailer to this movie, and you've seen a few movies in your day then you can definitely see where the movie is going. The execution though is excellent and it is so entertaining watching as the main character, Jess, is discovering what is going on along with us the audience and figuring out how to resolve the current predicament. I felt it was a good mix of genres though marketed as more of a horror flick definitely implements a little sci-fi and mystery/thriller elements more so than straight up horror.After the conclusion and thinking about everything that transpired through the movie, yes you may find a few plot holes, but is ultimately satisfying and interesting. Despite the few flaws and rather predictable ending (even though I enjoyed the conclusion and felt it was appropriate) did not detract at all from the great experience this little gem of a movie provided for its run time. While not perfect I felt a 10 out of 10 was appropriate as it is definitely something I will watch again; I was entertained through the whole movie; and I hope others read this and chose to check this movie out and encourage these filmmakers to keep doing other projects.",Triangle
416,whizlue,"So predictable, nothing new, good acting only",4,10 February 2011,"I don't understand why many people seem to find this movie so mind-boggling and -twisting because I find this movie very boring. I mean, when you see the main character (Jess) killed her first self (masked-Jess) and saw her friends shouting for help on the sea, anyone could immediately see that the movie ends in either of two ways: (a) she finds a way out somehow and the film ends happily or with a dramatic turn of events, or (b) she struggles in vain and the film ends up repeating itself. I wish there were more twist in it like Lost series. The last part when Jess was killed were also easily predictable. She was being mentally ill from the start and wasn't sure where her son was, saying ""I feel tired."" That looked like a typical scene where something traumatic happened to the person. And as the story went, she was trapped in her world - again typical psychotic caricaturisation of closing her door to the real world). Why she wants to run away from the reality? Because the reality is unbearable. What horrible thing could happen to her? Some form of loss she regards precious. Then, it's too obvious (although I wrongly guessed that it would be her deliberate action). I also found some of her course of actions a little contradictory (such as being committed to killing everyone just to repeat the process when the only obstacle is her another self) but I leave it as because she was psychotic. I also couldn't see the role of Heather, at all. I give 4 stars for good acting performance and for successfully connecting the chain of events. But that was all.",Triangle

If you like to see horror and not horrible movies, make a favor to yourself and avoid this one!My main complaint is actually the plot's reasoning- or rather the lack of it.

421,can-o-mark,"Confusing, non-sensical, and not scary.",4,26 December 2010,"This movie has to be one of the most disappointing ""horror"" movies I have ever seen. To start of with the most basic complaint: 'It's not scary'. Triangle is one of the least scary horror movies I have ever seen. Not because the moments they try to scare you, just aren't that scary. But because there simply aren't any moments in the film that are meant to be scary. The entire movie is basically a mind-twister that starts after about 20 minutes, and doesn't stop, right until the end.After realizing this, I thought: ""Well, it will probably have some good twists and mind-benders in there"". Sadly enough, I was wrong. The movie is extremely confusing, and instead of putting all the pieces together at some part, it seems as if though they just keep adding pieces, never explaining where they came from, where they are going and why they were used in the first place.The concept behind the film is already pretty confusing, but definitely interesting. The film itself is made in such a way that it just becomes more and more confusing. As soon as the film was nearing it's end I figured we would be offered a glimpse into the origin of the plot, but I was sadly mistaken.If you are looking for a good mind-bender, don't watch this movie.

427,l_jacko,Help ME break the loop!,1,11 October 2010,"Honestly, I am pretty speechless having just watched this movie.THE PLOT.A trout faced women and her friends are stranded at sea and board an abandoned vessel. Trout face soon finds out this is no normal cruise ships as she begins to see future/past versions of herself from previous ""loops"". She sets out to frantically PROVE to her friends that she is not crazy but then every time she see's a duplicate version of herself and the opportunity to jump out and say ""HEY LOOK, THERE'S TWO OF ME"" she decides to run OFF or hide around corners. Eventually in a future loop deciding to just kill everyone, yeah that'll make your point. The entire film DOESN'T work as a paradox because MOST plot points become contradictory mid way through.The film ends right back at the beginning with trout face weather beaten and traumatized by the events that had just happened/were about to happen again and yet mid way through the film she's completely SHOCKED by everything thats happening as if she has no clue!For me a real mind twister is a film that can present an irrational situation in a VERY rational way. I am not lacking in imagination but it's difficult to become a part of the fantasy when the story is tripping itself up every second with an irrational and infuriating protagonist.There are other films that deal with these themes in a much better way, I'd recommend Donnie Darko, LOST, The butterfly effect, Groundhog Day, and Cube: Hypercube.

428,mjschwar-1,Massive Headwound Hemsworth,6,1 April 2018,"***mild, mild spoliers to follow***There's a special kind of film every slasher fan knows well. I call them Grate Films: movies that somehow entertain despite the fact that one roots against the main cast, not for them. The kind of film where friends place excited bets on who deserves to get Savini'd next and why, and applaud when they're right. In this regard, Triangle is a truly Grate Film. Melissa George stars as Billie Piper, a woman with seriously questionable taste in footwear who shows up for a pleasure cruise with friends several days after her Zoloft prescription has expired. (Or maybe she thought this was an audition because there was a Hemsworth waiting out front.) Twilight Zone-y wackiness then ensues, which could accurately be described as some chick who's never seen Groundhog's Day playing Dark Souls on the cruise ship from that one Resident Evil mobile game. Which makes this ""the Dark Souls of 'Dark Souls on a cruise ship movies'"", I guess. Eventually a Hemsworth gets fingered.Ultimately, this is a horror film about people trapped in a confined space with a protagonist who's too stupid/crazy/clinically depressed to explain what's going on, and how her idiocy puts everyone else in mortal danger. I won't give away much more, because once you get past the obligatory setup there are actually a few good choices and twists, and a surprising meticulousness to the plotting that's possibly hinted at by the Rosemary's Baby-esque opening theme. This doesn't get in the way of the characters acting like complete tools at all times, however, despite a really clever solution to the problem of keeping the body count high without having to hire more actors. The ending manages to be a potent cocktail of predictable, impossible, and really, really stupid. Few films have been so vehemently anti-nap.Triange is best approached as a slightly elevated slasher film. Despite following every good idea up with a grate one, there is guaranteed entertainment value here, especially for groups that enjoy yelling at the screen. #makemoviesgrateagain",Triangle
429,mellylad,Hit and Miss,8,18 March 2010,"For me, this film was a hit and miss for me because even though it was a very good thriller/slasher, it soon became far too complex for many slasher fans, who normally watch slasher films because of the gore.I would argue that this film does have some aspects of gore and violence in it, it definitely tried too hard to move away from the traditional slasher/thriller where it would make the audience think about the film but sooner or later the audience are asking more questions than they are getting answers.Personally I had to watch the film through twice so that I could understand the plot.

430,majidolyaei,Astonishing movie that you're strongly recommended not to miss!!,8,7 January 2011,"When I wanted to watch this movie it was 1:30 a.m and I decided to see about half of the film and then go to bed, so that I would watch the second part the day after as I sometimes do it. However the film so drastically had me drowned that I watched it up to the very last second without noticing the time.The story is great, the twisted plot gets you baffled from time to time, and you are never sure what is happening. Honestly speaking after watching the film I had different guesses and finally part of them I could make accepted for myself by the help of discussions and theories I read in IMDb discussion board, many still have confusion and controversy on the story and what really happens though. To me it makes sense that Jessi died in the car accident with her son, and then in the purgatory she didn't follow the death man (taxi driver) and got into a loop and continued it for times in order to 1. save her son and the other guys despite the fact it was a vain attempt as the taxi driver told her; or 2. it's possible that she loses her memory of what happened before each time when she's in the taxi sleeping, therefore she starts a new loop unaware of the fact it would lead to the start point. In this second view as many suggest it makes sense that she is having her soul purged in these repeated circles, as we see when she sees her son again she is regretful for her previous bad or mean treatments towards him (her soul is getting purged).

431,blackjackel,One of the best movies of all time,9,16 May 2014,"SPOILERS AHEAD, SPOILERS AHEAD! SPOILERS AHEAD!Many people posted bad reviews for the movie because they think it is full of plot holes, If you are one of these people please send me a private message with your plot holes and I will do my best to explain them to you. Some say the main actress acted irrationally without going into detail as to WHY or HOW, again please message me and I will explain.I will attempt to explain some of the major ""plot holes"" that people think this movie has. I copied and pasted some questions word-for-word from a review that I already read which were common amongst other reviews.Here's a brief transcript in the movie, it is relevant to my explanation:Come check this out. This is the same ship. This thing's old. Jess. Oome on. Oome on. Here's where we boarded. Oh, yeah. Aeolus. Aeolus was the Greek god of the winds and the father of Sisyphus, the man condemned by the gods to the task of pushing a rock up a mountain and let it see roll back down again. That's a shitty punishment. What did he do? He cheated Death. No, he made a promise to Death that he didn't keep. I studied it but I can't remember.1) What happen at the end when they got into the car crash, and she's perfectly fine? She was wearing a seat belt, while her child was in the back seat without a seat belt and therefore died. If you're wondering why she didn't put a seat belt on her child, see explanation of question 3. Sometimes a seat belt is the difference between dying and walking away without a scratch.2) Why is it that nobody sees her except for the taxi driver? The taxi driver is death, and he is the reason the loop is happening, if you look at my transcript you'll see that ""He cheated death, no, he made a promise to death that he didn't keep"". By killing herself and staying alive, she cheated death... Also as she is leaving the taxi, he asks if she'll be black, she says ""Yes, I promise"", she knows that she can't really be back (as in from the harbor, which is what the taxi driver REALLY asked her), so she made a promise to death that she couldn't keep. If you go re watch the scene where the taxi driver walks up to her for the first time, you will see the colors dim, the movie gets dark, and the music becomes ominous. The taxi driver is death, and this is why he was the only one that can see her.3) If she remembers everything. She knows exactly why she's going on the sail boat (apparently to go back in time to save her kid), then why is she doing the same thing over and over again? The loop does not happen the EXACT SAME WAY every time, you can see this by the scene where she discovers the bodies of one of her victims, they are strewn all over the place, indicating that the loop happens differently every time.Perhaps the last time the loop happened, her child died in a different way, which is why she isn't EVER able to stop her child dying. For example, when she goes to pick up the dead seagull after hitting it, maybe her child opens the door and runs across the freeway, and dies... maybe in other loops its a heart attack... etc.The only thing wrong with the movie is that she should have been much more paranoid about her child in the end, because she should know that he can die in various ways. Maybe some part of her knows, that, as the taxi driver said ""There's nothing anyone can do that's gonna bring him back."", but chooses to continue the loop by going to the harbor because she doesn't care, she would rather live with the faint glimmer that maybe at some point she can save him.",Triangle

The main character did not try that hard to change the series of events over several attempts. Also there is no explanation as to why things were happening and how she was the person it was happening to.

Once you accept that, the movie is on a whole different level. Which helps explains the wide swings in user review. Most either being a 1 or a 10.

442,lonnycoyne,Brilliant and Unique,8,3 July 2012,This is a film I will never forget and I watch hundreds of films particularly horrors I will very often go through binges of 6 or 7 on a rainy day in with my boyfriend. Most of them will be forgotten except for the really good or really bad ones. (This is one of the really good ones)This is not a typical horror film its is more of a mystery but certainly not typical of either genres. I usually don't like these sorts of films and I HATE films that leave unanswered questions that you can not work out because the film makers could not be bothered to figure out a plot that makes sense.This film may seem as though it dose not make sense but everything is explained you just have to pay attention and think about it. Even if you don't want to think about it or try to understand everything that happened it's a really fun ride and a great and unique concept.If you want to watch something that's a bit different and will stand out from the crowd I would greatly recommend this film. If you want to watch a fast paced mystery/ horror that is not so conceptual and stylised tryThe Ward Dream House Breathing Room Panic Button Devil Identity,Triangle

Given the movie only has 9 actors, it does not disappoint. It's not scary in the fact of things jumping out or ghosts or gore, but it's scary in the sense that you almost want to cry because you feel so uncomfortable. The ending leaves you with a void that you want to be filled because its so terrifying, and at some parts of the movie I felt I should go into another room because the movie made me feel like I was actually there. I can't believe it didn't get any hype at all, considering Liam Hemsworth is one of the characters. I just happened to be searching through amazon prime instant video and this popped out at me.

I gave it another chance and was not disappointed. It was less horror than expected and more of a psychological thriller.First of all, the acting is terrible. All of the actors are mediocre but the main actor stands out by being awful. The script does not help either and her character is too simple, expressing the same emotion for the whole movie.
The visuals are not great but i don't care too much for such a film, however, better sound would have helped here.The idea and concept is where the movie excels, and except for the first part, the plot is very intriguing until the very end. Like a proper psychological thriller it's ambiguous at first and makes you discover the story piece by piece, tying reasonably well, with a logical, satisfying ending.It reminded me very much of Memento, the director was probably quite ispired by that movie.",Triangle

EVERY time I understand more little things about the movie. Look up the story of SISYPHUS son of ""Aoleus"" (even wikipedia has a page on him). He made a promise to death as it says in the movie. Sisyphus in the real myth after he was sent to the underworld promised Persephone he would return to the underworld if he was allowed to leave and go above to scold his living wife for not burying his dead body. The movie used that part of the myth when Jess said to her son she would burry the bird. At the end the main actress Jess promises the taxi driver she would come back and pay but breaks her promise. Obviously the taxi cab driver was death or Hades or Hermes all of whom were used in different variations of the myth to bring Sisyphus to the underworld. So like the myth of Sisyphus goes, Jess had to do something over and over again for all of eternity also. Sisyphus had to push a boulder up a hill only to watch it roll back down. for breaking a promise to death. Jess has to relive he son dying and try to save him over and over.",Triangle

453,cntctjhunt,A psychological assault that aspires to be much more than simply another horror.,9,29 April 2015,"Following his gore-filled 2004 film 'Creep', Christopher Smith tackles the suitably more twisted 'Triangle', a psychological assault that aspires to be much more than simply another horror. Australian actress Melissa George is Jess, who along with her group of friends is forced to board an ocean liner cruising past the scene of their shipwreck. The party regret boarding, however, when they are soon after terrorised by a masked assailant.Don't be fooled by the premise; while the marketing department may have sold this to the masses as a straightforward slasher, Triangle is anything but. This a film for an audience that loves to not quite understand, encouraging them to spend the hours and days afterwards pondering the intricacies of the events depicted. Here, Smith reveals them with the kind of utmost precision and attention to detail that ensures his hard work remains coherent when put under scrutiny.Melissa George carries the film, grounding its premise with an easy to relate performance of an exhausted, altruistic mother. While Smith devotes much of his attention to this aspect of Jess's character and makes it crucial to the plot, it is George who makes it truly convincing.Those curious about 'Triangle' are better served by not spoiling further details of the plot, as this is a film you can only watch 'first' once; subsequent viewings take on a whole new angle. Casual viewers looking for a gory slasher will be disappointed, but any admirer of the psychological thriller will be in their element. Horror fans, beware; horror aficionados, enjoy.",Triangle

455,kieranljones,Just watch it! Don't read reviews or spoilers first!,9,18 January 2021,"This movie is massively underrated. IMDb has it at a score of 6.9 at the time of me writing this, which frankly is a travesty. I am fully confident that this is a function of people giving a low score because they were frustrated by not understanding the film (because they were not paying enough attention, were unwilling to think about it and rewatch, or perhaps they are just straight up stupid and should have watched transformers 12 instead).The storyline and it's execution is close to flawless, it is genuinely tense and chilling, there is ZERO unnecessary fat to trim from this movie. Everything that you see is relevant, either it literally explains the plot or it gives you strong metaphorical hints at the underlying reason why it is all happening.SPOILERS BELOW!!!We do not see Jess (the protagonist) murder her son in the film, but she does (note, it is 7.15 when Jess starts screaming at / hitting her son, we learn this if you pay close attention to the film). She puts his body in a bag and drags it into the car. She drives away to dispose of the body but crashes her car and dies (just over an hour after the drama with her son started to play out, at 8.17 AM. This is why her watch is stopped at 8.17am when everyone else thinks it's 11.30 - this is when they all died, in the storm out at sea, apart from Heather who they think has died but was in fact the only member to survive the storm). The ""driver"" who picks her up after the car accident represents Death; he offers to take her somewhere and asks where she wants to go.... This is the crucial moment of free will that could end her purgatory time loop, she could at this point decide to accept her fate, accept that she murdered her son then died in the car crash, and move on to the afterlife. But, as flawed human nature dictates, she repeatedly chooses to go back to the harbour, board the yacht with her friends and repeat the whole loop endlessly, just like the mythological Sisyphus who is mentioned in the film (repeatedly having to push the boulder up the hill as punishment for his sins and for ""cheating death"". Either she is doing this because she is still hanging on in futility to a hope of saving her son and changing history, or she knows that this is impossible (as Death already told her after the car crash) but decides to repeat the loop anyway just so she can see her son again.

457,joshdoherty,Underrated movie,8,6 November 2017,"I recently re-watched Triangle, and enjoyed it a lot more on the second viewing. On first appearance, it's a horror / thriller that soon twists into something more. It's let down slightly by some clunky CGI, but aside from that racks up the tension pretty well. Melissa George is excellent, the rest of the cast don't really get enough screen time to impress but overall the standard of performance is decent.Big spoiler here: there is however, a couple of plot holes which really jarred with me - where Jess breaks the loop and runs in on herself before being attacked by Victor. This made no sense as every other part of the loop showed the inevitability of time repeating itself. The other, where she drags Downey's body into room 237 (nice nod to The Shining there) why are there not multiple bodies, like there is with Sally?Aside from those minor gripes, great time travel flick and the end scenes with the car accident are absolutely worth the whole watch.",Triangle
458,Rishav98,A Good Thriller-Horror Movie!!,6,24 August 2020,"I thought it was good, except for the violence but because the storyline was great I have to give it 6 stars. I especially liked the last 15 minutes of it or so. It was a unique movie, I haven't seen or read another story quite like it. Whoever wrote the script for it must have a lot of talent, a lot of components of the unexplained and you can't put your finger on an exact explanation for the events but rather have theories about it at the end of it all. Is it metaphorical, insanity, or some sort of dimensions thing, none of these are wrong depends on who is watching it. My take away from it was that it was a nightmare, how someone with Jess' life would process the information of her life while sleeping and hopefully this isn't a story ""spoiler"" for anyone who hasn't watched it yet, processing of personal cycles in life which don't have a resolution. Jess both hates and loves herself, I like how this was reflected in the movie, she has a hard time killing the bad part of her over and over again, but not at the end where she does it without hesitation and gives it all a try again possible for the last time. There probably aren't two Jess', but I don't think that would be a wrong interpretation of the movie either, the story is really up to who is viewing it. The whole thing about the only way to save herself is to kill others including her double if they come on board the boat, I think is probably a mental rescue attempt of the only way she can save herself from the demons which will eventually destroy her which she has with her all the time is to get rid of them (kill them so they aren't around). She feels the real her is covered and trying to do the right things, might be afraid to show people who she actually is, might not even know herself ect., that's why the head cloak if you're looking at it metaphorically. Maybe she actually does board a boat and goes insane with what's been scrambling through her head, maybe it's a strange dimension thing, it's probably the viewers' choice. For all we know it could be a story about going on a trip and changing who she is lies in the beginning ""he's at school"" but then begins confronting herself and toward the end then getting the feeling she is going to fail when she gets back and she's going to hurt her kid again even if unintended.. the varieties of interpretation are probably extensive. If I could say one thing to the scriptwriter it would be this, ""I know why you started the chaos off with an electrical storm.""",Triangle

461,lexydivina,Solving The Mystery,8,20 August 2019,"This movie could be very disturbing to those who have lived through or got a relative with mental issues, OCD and PTSD.
In the beginning this movie is about a very tired and peaceful single mother who goes on a casual boat trip (called TRIANGLE) with her recently befriended customer (implied she is a waitress).
As the story goes they seem to experience a disturbing phenomenon on the sea after the boat got into a sudden storm. A woman's ""double"" starts killing everyone and she soon realizes she's been trapped in a time loop and has to kill everyone in order to survive herself and to come back to her deeply loved autistic son. But the end of the film reveals she's not as peaceful and nice as she seems to be with Matt (her befriened customer she kills first) and she was not a very good mother either.Violence: explicit bloody violence shown from schizophrenic's p.o.v. which is ""kill everyone who is not myself"" perfectly reasoned by the voices in her head.
She gets more angry being told that everything is happening just in her head and tends to use every tool as a weapon inc. guns and knives.
Contains a scene where woman is very very hard on her autistic son: she is yelling on him and asks why he can't be normal.
It is also implied that she is not mentally stable herself and might be causing his state with her harming parenting behavior.
There is a scene of a car crash in the end which might be implying the woman is struggling of PTSD trying to recreate an alternative end of her story over and over again.",Triangle

473,karan_40,A Torturing Watch,1,20 November 2012,"This is my first review on IMDb even though I've been a user for years. The reason this film forced me to write is because of how torturous it was. I feel my crime was having previously watched 'Los cronocrímenes'. Despite the filmmaker's assurances its pretty obvious that Triangle is inspired by 'Los cronocrímenes'. People who enjoyed this film need to desperately watch that one. It is a far greater film with a plot that will genuinely keep you hooked. Less than halfway into Triangle I knew exactly where the plot was going and then it was just a sheer nightmare. The film, though shot and directed well, assumes that its viewers have never seen films of this genre. It runs out of material pretty quickly and then painfully explains and idiot-proofs everything till the end. The protagonist often acts or refrains from acting without motivations and its frustrating how many times she does things simply because they somehow must have made sense in the writer's head. Most of all the movie scared me because I realised how easy it is for a writer/director to go astray like this. Being one myself I shuddered at the thought of ever having something like this as a finished product. This would be a good attempt if it was a really low budget debut indie exercise. But currently it looks like the money was wasted on a script that lacks ideas and feels half-baked.",Triangle
474,Godsarini,Good stab at a horror paradox story but unfortunately full of holes,7,30 January 2010,"THIS REVIEW DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS! First off i enjoyed this film, i was gripped right up until the first plot hole and even after that i was hoping to be hit by an epic twist that would reveal that hole as being totally filled. Saddly by the end of the film there are still many holes left gapingly open and I'd like to explain what i thought these holes were, if anyone can explain it to me differently please do!First off, for the film to work the main character must have no idea of the 'groundhog day like' loop she is stuck in until she sees herself and her friends from the ocean liner for the first time, this makes the ending in which she deliberately restarts the loop from the beginning completely contradictory as she clearly knows what she is getting herself into. I accept this can be partially explained away by just assuming that the main character merely loses her memory sometime between boarding her friends boat and boarding the liner, probably during the storm, could be a symbolic nod to her memories of the loop being 'washed away'.The future version of the main character (the murderous one who she clips with the shotgun) is an anomaly. The main character never becomes this version of herself, never kills the others with a knife and never battles and ultimately kills this version of herself before throwing her overboard. There is no clue as to how she ever became that evil, other than taking shrapnel to the head :)I've edited this review a few times as it is incredibly hard to explain exactly what was wrong with the film because its so complicated and makes any explanation hard to follow, believe me when i say there are many other little faults however.Finally there is the question about the taxi driver at the end, this bit i do understand. When the group first arrive on the ocean liner they talk about a Greek mythical story about a man cursed to forever push a rock up a hill just to see it fall back down again and again, this was apparently a punishment for cheating death. With this in mind the taxi driver is obviously supposed to be death or at least some power responsible for the loop. After the car accident the driver takes her back to the harbour, her intent clearly to try to right the death of her child, however i suspect that her 'curse' may be responsible for removing her memory, again probably during the storm.If you have understood any of this review then frankly i'm surprised, even if you have seen it :) For those who haven't yet seen the film i hope that this review has simply sparked your curiosity because despite its faults it is still a watch worthy film.",Triangle

I rented this from Red Box, thinking it might be a fun twist on the Bermuda Triangle or at least and entertaining B horror film...sadly I was wrong on both counts. The film starts out decently, with most of the cast giving very believable performances...save for the lead who seems to almost never change her initial ""I'm on too many painkillers"" expression. As the story finally hits its 2nd act it degrades into something that only really resembles swiss cheese. The amount of holes in this film are unbearable and ultimately any intelligent movie viewer will just feel stupid for trying to find any logic in the main characters actions or dilemma. I wont go through any details as calling them spoilers are worthless...the film makes no sense and relies completely on the characters simply being stupid.

I never write reviews but this movie upset me enough to write one. It's possible that I missed something, like where did the version of her that gets into the cab come from? Even though I don't know the answer to that, I'm sure there is an answer since the only redeeming quality of this movie is that they have the time- lines down. It feels as though they think that is enough to make it a good movie. Good job, guys, you can keep track of the flow of events within interlacing time-lines. But what good is that if the events are retarded? I don't know HOW many times she was watching the group of friends from behind a corner. Don't you think they might listen to you if they see that there's two of you? That sure would be better than simply telling them that there's multiple of you, yes? And maybe your further knowledge of the plot would help everyone? Or how she decides to play along with the repeated tragedy. She says she wants to change things--not that I'm sure she does because she's retarded--but she knowingly does the exact same thing, keeping the loop going. Since she played into it throughout the entire movie, I can only assume that she wanted to keep it going in order to see her son again and so on. But why? She says her son is in school, right? How about go pick him up!! Like you need to go to the boat and kill people to see him again, seriously. Granted, we don't know where that version of her came from so she may not know what's going on despite seeing at least her son, if not herself, dead in the street. Well how about when she gets back home; must she kill herself? Couldn't she yet again be like, ""I know this is weird but let's go talk to the neighbor like nothing is happening. If he freaks out because there's two of us, we know others can see both of us."" Sure, they may get captured by the government or something weird, but at least play the movie out where she makes semi-rational decisions! Please. Basically there are things like that all throughout the movie where she doesn't make the most logical decision based on her motivation. She plays into the traps constantly. Unless her motivation isn't her son and is simply to keep copies of herself in this loop for some twisted reason that makes no sense. But as I said before, the movie does a very good job of keeping up with itself. And that's about it.",Triangle

After more than 25 years of watching movies, this is the first time I ""need"" to shout warning other human beings not to commit a crime against their souls and minds by watching this motion picture.If there was a time machine, I would go back in time: not to save the world but to slap my self before watching this movie...Some visual effects and artistic directing didn't help save this film.

This movie can definitely be classified as having an original story line, but the way the idea is worked out just makes it an awful movie. The main problem of the movie is that too many weird twists in the story line as well as the behavior of the characters (especially the freaky main character)leave you completely flabbergasted to the point you just have to laugh. Dialogues are completely unbelievable and so are individual decisions taken by the characters in the movie.

If something happens time after time on a loop to start again from the same spot then it should logically follow the same pattern every time? So why does it happen that things happen different ways but show as having happened before? confusing? just like the film! How did it start in the first place? did she turn up at the boat smiling? When the main character is nearly strangled why does it not happen again? Why does she then confront herself, who then fails to tell anyone she has seen herself?Oh i could go on but there is no story just a twist and another twist that you kind of expect or can predict.Saying that it is kind of compelling and there are a few surprises but the main question is WHY? tell me the reason a single mother ends up on a deserted ship which sails itself and is basically the Mary Celeste!

And I was so wrong. While you watch this movie from the beginning you start asking questions, in some situations I was really thrilled and confused, sometimes cause of that was the brilliance that movie was made with, because it is cleverly done. I say that because when I thought in some moments that I realized some holes, the continuing of the story showed that movie had been done in the way with its details to cover possibly holes in the script. Portraying main character Jess was also remarkable.

I now own this film and have watched it dozens of times. Not only is this an amazing Indy film, but an amazing film in general. The plot is twister than a roller coaster and the cast is quite underrated. There is one scene involving a hammer, I guarantee you will rewind it many times. The Movie itself is a quite a good story of how our actions in the past may have us stuck without a future. This movie combines typical a slasher type and a mental thriller.

The first part of the movie looked very well made, even though I had a deja-vu while viewing it. But so far so good.The first killings occur, and I'm very surprised since everybody was dead and there was lot's of time to fill. Then it hit me. It's another looping movie theme. I was OK with it, and wondered how the writers will tell the story, and what did they come up with. But I was very disappointed. All the way through i was just wondering why in hell is she doing exactly as the predecessors. The story wanted to sound like pure logic makes her do what she's doing, but let me tell you that i didn't buy that.Besides all the holes the movie has, i just didn't got the accident part. How did her body get out of the trunk and out of the bag. Why was she sitting in front of the car.If she did a complete loop in the movie who were the others that stab the couple and that got shot in the head.I personally didn't liked the movie at all and founded it an insult to be honest. It wasn't smart made, and just because the creators wanted us to think that it was made me angry.I gave it a 3/10, and that's because of the imagery, not of the story and anything else.

493,siezmic,This movie is so good I'm going back to theater,3,26 December 2010,"Everything other than the entire plot of this movie is acceptable - if I was in a generous mood I could say that there are reasons some people might like it - scenery, nice boat etc, and others might not like it (everything else)...but the universal killer is the inconceivably weak and frankly idiotic plot. Think Groundhog Day without the humor, without the script quality, and clearly without any conceptualization of intelligence on the part of any of the roles in the movie.In brief, a day out on a sailing boat turns into a nightmare for all aboard when they are caught in a sudden ""Burmuda triangle-esq"" storm which the apparently experienced skipper seems unable to react to and which, after capsizing the boat, disappears in seconds.The day-trippers board a ghostly ship before it steams off without any apparent crew or guests on board. people then start dying and continue to die until the end of the movie - they die again and again and again...The plot is truly pitiful - one of those movies where one hopes that the screen-writers paid the producer as opposed to the other way around.

It really makes you think!However, with all of that, my wife and I found ourselves watching the clock a lot during the movie, and we just seemed anxious for it to finish. Something wasn't quite right with the chemistry. I think it was because Melissa George as the lead just didn't work; she didn't seem to keep us interested in her fate. along with that, I really didn't find myself caring about the fate of any of the cast.

Easily it's one of the most offensive and obvious clichés, and it's played totally straight (has the director never seen a horror movie??). Trust me - the whole movie is frustrating in this way. There are just too many moments where things could have been different if the protagonists acted sensibly, like why doesn't jess expose herself while the rest of the group is all together? Just presenting herself would have stated her case, but instead she waits until she gets one of them alone before explaining herself in a situation where she has nothing to back up her claim. If she's going to try to help them anyways why not do it when she has the clean evidence in front of her, it's not like she didn't have a multitude of chances. why? why would she wait?

I think we learned our lesson to listen to the negative reviews too! Let me start by saying we are huge horror movie buffs. I love a good scare. Maybe I had too much of a high expectation but this movie had very few and cheap scares that jolted me and that was it. I wasn't constantly on the edge of my seat.My partner laughed a few times because there were so many 'cheesy' moments that didn't really fit the storyline. In fact we struggled to follow what exactly the storyline was. It was nothing like Memento (which was cleverly executed). This movie was not like that at all. It holds your attention for the first 30 minutes and then it loses sight of the purpose and intention of the storyline.We love Melissa George and there are plenty of great Aussie actors in this film. Their acting is at least believable and Melissa does this movie justice. Without her main role, this movie would be a solid 2 stars.I have given it a very generous 5 because I felt the theme in itself was clever and the location on a deserted ship was the perfect scary place for this film. Other than that, it wasn't effective enough for me to stay frightened for very long.I would encourage others to make up their own mind and see it.. but I wish I could get those 2 hours of my life back.

She killed her son, perhaps with their hands on their negligence and bitchiness, which led to the death of her son. For she was too psychotic and did not show at all this love. Exactly what happened the first time - the director has not shown specifically. But the next version of death, we have already shown.In the story, we eventually see the 1st Jess becomes 2nd, 2nd - 3rd.

Rotted food for Jess - a definite duration of events passed it cycle for all time ... Chains and notes - cycle. Show us a real game Ship Aeolus on the mythical and mystical level.The movie shows Jess who manages to sink into the water, without having to kill all, namely that girlfriend Jess, Jess that enveloped her blouse on the deck above, so we see that not all of those girlfriends shrouded blouse - it shows us that not every Jess took place in the real world, but rather symbolically presented as a sacrifice on the mythical and mystical level, or ship, or even some kind of mythical creatures, because to pay for everything and this is an opportunity to change fee and get everything back to balmy ...Storm is an indication that they belong to another world, a world beyond time, space between the otherworldly and the real worlds.

There's still at sea before the storm, time passes differently from that AEOLUS, where he was allegedly not in the sense that there is in real life - great. And when Jess kills them all until the yacht, she would long to kill them, but they were always ready to appear on a yacht (bridge triangle) on the arrival of Aeolus, immediately after all the murders.Thus, it is killing the first friends, once again launched Aeolus cycle, so that once outside the time of the real world, she waited for itself after 2 hours 15 + - minutes when we arrived ... more As a result, we see that another kill Jess herself was not necessary, but just everyone else and take a dip in the sea, it does not matter whether the choke in the end, and if the dead fall into the water ...Perhaps there even a hint of the fact that the yacht and she did not need, and it did not need to kill your friends.

514,Mongster,In The Zone,9,1 June 2012,"Christopher Smith's follow-up to Creep and Severance plays like an extended Twilight Zone episode and, at 99 minutes, manages to engross you with its haunting, twisty premise without stretching it to preposterous proportions. Born in 1970 in Bristol, Smith was a film buff from very early on, particularly fond of the films of Martin Scorsese. His first productions were the shorts The 10000th Day and The Day Grandad Went Blind, released in 1997 and 1998 respectively, and which went on to some critical acclaim. In 2004, Smith wrote and directed his first full feature Creep which, whilst not overly engaging, went on to become a modest hit on DVD and allowed him to pursue filmmaking full-time.At odds with Creep's serious tone, Smith released the horror-comedy Severance in 2006, which saw office workers, including wide-boy Danny Dyer, attending a team building exercise in Hungary and being hunted and murdered in ingeniously gory ways by a group of crazed killers. Showing that he could deftly mix laughs with his horror, many presumed Smith would continue in this mould but surprised us all with this ultra-serious offering. There are no laughs, even unintentional, to be found here.Melissa George, who began her career in the Australian soap Home And Away but has since gone on to much acclaim starring in films as diverse as Mulholland Drive, The Amityville Horror and LA Confidential, is on top form here, single-handedly carrying the film. Single mother Jess (George) boards a yacht with a group of friends and sets sail. Soon after, they encounter an ethereal storm which leaves their boat overturned and their fates seemingly sealed.Almost impossibly, they spot an aged luxury liner emerge from the distant mist, and a lone figure peering at them from the upper deck until disappearing from view.They clamber aboard the liner to find it seemingly uninhabited and its interior frozen in time; fresh food adorns the tables in the ballroom and a full brass band is set up on stage, awaiting its absent players.Taking its cue from such unexplained mysteries as the Mary Celeste and Bermuda Triangle (Smith explains on the DVD commentary that the original script found the characters crossing over the infamous region of North Atlantic ocean), the film soon finds its own feet when Jess locates a set of keys on the luxury ship's passageway that are unmistakably her own. How did they get there? And are they really alone on the ship?More mature in both content and presentation than his previous efforts, Smith has crafted a tantalisingly slippery tale that takes the viewer on a Möbius strip narrative that alludes to themes such as dreams, time-travel, Greek mythology and the mysteries of life and death, whilst never hammering home a specific interpretation. If you are expecting a movie that shows you all its cards before the fade-out, you will be sorely disappointed.If, however, you gravitate towards the surrealistic works of Lynch, Fellini or Richard Kelly's time-travel opus Donnie Darko, you'll find Smith's Triangle an engaging and satisfying ride.",Triangle

As you may have guessed from my rating and the fact that this is my only review, this is my favourite movie of all time. Some people may find this a little over the top which is understandable, but i will try to explain why I like it so much and why you should watch it at least once and with my recommendation twice or what the hell seven times.This movie is the best mind boggling adventure EVER. Period. It starts out slow and suddenly turns into a perfect-storm. While watching this movie I couldn't stop myself checking how many minutes left until the end because I was enjoying every single minute of it so much.The most unique thing that made me love this movie so much is, the movie is around 1.5 hours but when the movie ends you go into another adventure in your head for another 1.5 hours. I wont go into anymore detail but this is a must watch. Hope you'll enjoy watching it as much as I did.TIP: If you like this movie, show it to some of your friends and watch it with them.

516,sylmaievnas,Triangle Movie Logic Explanation,10,23 May 2014,"10 points for this movie! So unique! I just watched this old movie Triangle very recently. After that, I read quite a few reviews on this movie, including the ones from Douban in China and the ones from IMDb. I do this because I've been absolutely attracted by the excitement and joy of trying to figure out the logic of the world in this movie. I would say that I actually find a few insightful explanations made by other movie fans, but I'm afraid none of them is fully satisfying for me. So I decided to make this video and do my own explanation. You can find my video via this link:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWZfHfQokMA&feature=youtu.beWhat an exciting and unique movie! The key point of my explanation is that there are seven stages for one loop: Stage 1: Jess wakes up on the yacht with a broken memory. Jess goes on to the ship Aeolus with a broken memory. This Jess is the heroine of the movie, which is ""Our Jess"". She is also the Group 1 Jess. And then after pushing the masked killer into the sea, it comes to Stage 2: ""Our Jess"" meets Group 2. After ""Our Jess"" watches Group 2 Jess kill unmasked killer Jess, it comes to Stage 3: ""Our Jess"" meets Group 3. When ""Our Jess"" is pushed into the sea by Group 3 Jess, it comes to Stage 4: ""Our Jess"" wakes up on the beach and runs home. Then ""Our Jess"" experiences the car accident and goes for sailing again. But this time, ""Our Jess"" has a full memory, and she goes on to the ship with her full memory. ""Our Jess"" pretends to be unaware of what's happening because she doesn't know which Jess she should play as, until she is pointed by a gun by another Jess. Now ""Our Jess"" knows that she is the ""Pointed Jess"", which is the one in Group 2. She knows what to do. She kills the unmasked Jess and lets Group 1 Jess watch it. When Group 3 Jess comes, it is Stage 6. ""Our Jess"" hides and deals with dead bodies and let Group 3 Jess push Group 1 Jess into the sea. Then comes a new group, we call it Group 4. And this is Stage 7: Group 3 Jess will point her gun at Group 4 Jess. ""Our Jess"" gets her mask and gets wounded by Group 3 Jess. ""Our Jess"" will get unmasked and get killed by Group 4 Jess. After ""Our Jess"" is really killed, her memory is broken. And she will wake up in the yacht again with a broken memory. And Jess' loop moves on.",Triangle

You can not take your eyes off this picture...don't be interrupted even in the event of an emergency at the time you are watching this gem of a motion picture--let the tornado or worse pass. The writing-direction & acting are priceless! I could tell you exactly what this film is about, however, it is just my guess...although, you probably would agree with my opinion. This is not a movie for children to see, but when your kids grow up make sure they see this film again & again.",Triangle
519,argirovovou,"If not the best, one of the best movies I have ever seen. Some people don't seem to get it though.",10,31 August 2015,"Although I should, I am not going to discuss about the amazingly smart plot and how meaningful the movie is, or about the unforgettable excellent acting skills of Melissa George. It's almost scary how underrated this movie is. But unfortunately most people simply don't get it. What I need to discuss is about a personal theory I have about the character of Melissa George, Jess. Well, there seems to be a confusion about how does the loop begins or why Jess has to kill everyone on board, and has amnesia. At first, I don't believe that the rest of the characters are real. They are either, the parts of her self that she chooses to hide, and kill, or a part of her punishment. If we notice the rest of the characters closely we realize that all of them are different and in a different part of their lives. The person who had ""troubles at home"" and left, the married couple, and Greg, who could represent the part of Jess that wants to stop being lonely. Now secondly, from my point of view Jess seems to remember what happens since the very beginning. Or at least at the part that we see as the beginning. If you notice her reactions you will realize that she doesn't seem shocked because of the loop but because the loop is happening again. Especially at the part where Victor finds her keys if you pause and see her face it's like she expected this to happen. She knows from the very beginning everything.The same way she managed to make us believe that she is a good mother when the truth is that she is terrible, she also managed to trick us and make us believe that she doesn't remember. She just travels in the loop again and again for two reasons : a) she has the false hope that she will save her son, b) the only way to see her son alive even for a few minutes is by living in the same loop again and again. The truth is that she killed her son and she also died. She either killed Tommy back in the house when she is losing her temper and she later died in the car accident, or they were both killed in the car accident. All we see is Jess trying to kill the dark parts of herself but uguess it's too late now. Isn't it? I hope I helped :)",Triangle
520,mirkomancinirm,A bit overrated,5,27 February 2019,"I came across this movie on the internet because everybody keep saying it's one of the most overlooked movies ever, a modern masterpiece, so maybe I had too high expectations.Anyway this works great as a nice mind-bender movie because you have to figure out what is happening, and the confusion is done in an interesting and intricated way. But after you solve the puzzle there is actually nothing much left to think about:(heavy spoilers from here) the plot is basically that she is in hell and is receiving a punishment for not keeping the promise she made with death to return (just like the myth of sisyphus, son of aeolus cied in the movie). During the course of her main loop she will sees herself mistreating her son, and I assume this constitutes one of the reasons she'll eventually end up in hell instead of heaven after she dies in the crash.This is the deepest the movie goes, but I don't think I'll love a movie just for saying ""she mistreated her son so she goes in hell"" in a single scene of a couple of minutes, it seems a pretty simple and too little explored idea during the movie. Is there another point other than this that I didn't get?Anyway if you love mind-benders where you have to figure out the plot this is your jam, but if you're looking for a more psycological kind or thriller like Shutter Island or Fight Club you might end up getting disappointed",Triangle

If they really think about this movie for a second they will find so many plot holes. This movie as you probably know is set on boat and our hero must find way to escape some type of time loop and stop a killer..... OK cool story no? NO. I said before there are BIG problems with story and i do not want to spoiler anything but to give you idea in one scene one character find notes on the ground and on every note is written (Kill them all) so he takes a pen and writes the same thing for some reason on another note and then he is like (OH NO THAT IS MY WRITING) it is stupid and pointless and it is there only to set you off. Also another thing that bother my is our hero has so many ways how to stop that time loop but she ruined everything. And also for some reason we can see effect of the time loop because there are multiple dead bodies of the same person or we can see same notes or necklaces but for some reason there is always only ten shotguns in the gun locker or we see written something on the mirror with blood but in next time loop is not there witch do not make any sense.,Triangle

The entire thing keeps you feeling like the good part is just around the next dead-end plot-twist, only to discover the best part is literally the effing end credits. It's like it kind of tried to take the novel idea of Inception and give it a horror movie plot twist, which would have worked if they had stopped 3, MAYBE 4 plot twists in, instead of turning it into a never ending maze of let downs, boring corridor running scenes, and loud noises. There is ZERO character development. I literally did not care who lived or died by the half way point just as long as the ever worsening twists ended.

Why is there not a bunch of dead Gregs in the theater, and a bunch of dead Vics? WHY does her memory suck sooooo much. I personally have never been time looped, so maybe I'm not able to speak on such things, but she clearly knows its boat time at the end. At the end she kills her former self (I Guess) stuffs the body in a car, gets pissed at her kid shes so worried about, wrecks it, early jess is now out of the trunk, tommy is dying or dead (oh also then they tight pan the car wreck and some kid is sitting in in its wake with his drum?)(pretty normal right?) she sits and watches with that same stupid face she has for most of the first half of the film(sometimes she ninjas out, its weird) then a taxi shows up behind her, not much time is given to this important scene, the sky darkens up and mild ominous tones, the taxi guy is like that kid ain't gonna make it wanna ride someplace?....Its to the beginning of the movie. She don't run to the kid, she don't even look all that shocked, it's just like...Oh well, lets do the boat thing again.

Also the movie does not kill the main character but some of the scenes kills the main character (this may not sound sane but there is actually a lot of main character and they are the same person this is because of the loop that repeats the situation therefore creating a new group of people)The excitement doesn't last. After the movie reveals what is really happening, you would get to understand immediately what really is the issue but not the cause of it which is another hole in the story.Tbh, I seriously don't understand why she has to kill all of them in order to get back to her son.

We find a single mother,played by Melissa George having quite some trouble raising her autistic kid. I think I saw this trope in The Babadook too (which came out later btw, just saying.

This movie tries to be clever, paying several homages to Kubrick's The Shining, but by the end of the movie, I just found it to be generally lacking in awakening any sense of awe in me.

But, since I saw Los Cronoscrimines before this, I only give a 4.Having just seen a comment by Christopher Smith that he 'came up with the idea in 2004 at the Cannes Film Festival' and that the sack hood was 'inspired by Friday 13th', I'm not inclined to believe him. Los Cronoscrimines (Time Crimes) was a low budget Spanish film released 2 years before this. It featured a man who became completely embroiled in a sequence of events that ultimately had several versions of himself running around doing things he had previously seen himself perpetrate. At one point, he sticks a sack cloth on his head so his earlier self does not recognise him. Just watch the film once you've watched this one and you'll see the similarities.While this film has it's merits, I couldn't help thinking of Time Crimes as soon as I'd seen the sack cloth 'later her'. As I see this as a rip off of Time Crimes, I think the maximum I could give Triangle is 4 stars.There is also one glaring plot hole that only about one review I have read has picked up on; the ultra-murder her, where the hell did she come from?! Talk about a convenient plot device to prevent her from succeeding in breaking the chain. I fear another Rec (Quarantine) situation; an excellent low budget Spanish flick picked up and ripped off by someone who felt the film wasn't main stream enough to be well known, and so ripe for the taking.As for his comments re 'thinking about it in 2004', that's a bit like me saying 'I've just invented the plane. But I thought of it before the Wright brothers.' I think I'd like some more evidence please, the similarities are just too glaring...",Triangle
